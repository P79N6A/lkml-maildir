But to USB developers, if it's not 100% they're in major trouble!
They're the folk who will be using this terminology/API the most.
The challenge here is to come up with something that doesn't
needlessly confuse the major communities of interest ... such
as by redefining terms that are already in use.

I tend to agree that the volume of such usage will outshout any
others, since a "device side" driver is mostly of interest to a
person doing embedded systems work.  (Or a PDA.)  Even
there, the scenario is to write one

Another overloaded word.  I've always seen it as the requestor,
in all contexts (restaurants, stores, networking ... :) and in USB
it's the "host" that requests.

Of the two I saw coming by this morning ("target" from Larry,
and "gadget" from Stephen) I confess I liked "target" best.
It captures the initating/responding roles quite well.
I don't recall many other suggestions that were forthcoming.
But I'll also toss out "firmware", which is often used in such
contexts:  firmware revision for a network adapter, and so on.
"USB firmware" is not likely to be expected on the host side.
"USB target firmware", and so on.
