This is most likely already fixed by commit
e82cc1288fa57857c6af8c57f3d07096d4bcd9d9.
Unless Linas can reproduce it with a newer kernel (I'm cutting an -rc6 
right now, but any -git snapshot in the last few days should work) this 
one should be closed.  We can't keep things open just because the tester 
hasn't tested.
