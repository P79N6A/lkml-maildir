Hi Rusty, Dave, Santiago
The vio devices currently don't have a modalias spec. This makes it
impossible to ask udev for loading the modules.
The modules already specifies a device table, which contains two values,
type and compat. At least for pSeries they seems to be filed from the
compatible and device_type properties in the openfirmware tree. The
pSeries code checks both values, while iSeries only checks the type.
As they need a complete match, the generated modalias string for them
may:
vio:T<type>
or
vio:T<type>C<compat>
