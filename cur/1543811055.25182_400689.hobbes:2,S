It is currently a symbol defined in head.S though.  Not hard to fix
but the point is that there are a few subtle things.

I suspect the easy way to do this is to put a variable with the start location
either at the very start or the very end of the data that gets compressed that
has the address to jump to.  Once we uncompressed the data we can lookup
the pointer and jump to it.
