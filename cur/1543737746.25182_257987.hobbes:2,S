But lots of things change. Unserialising the kernel broke code paths.

When you say low latency, you mean small lock hold times, *and*
cond_rescheds placed everywhere - it is this second requirement
that isn't the cleanest way of doign things.
With preempt, sure you still need small lock hold times. No big
deal.
