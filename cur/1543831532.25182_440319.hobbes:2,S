Paul,
Perhaps I should use the the other ascii format for specifying cpumasks 
since its more amenable
to specifying an upper bound for the length of the ascii string and is 
more compact ?
That format (the one used in lib/bitmap.c:bitmap_parse) is comma 
separated chunks of hex digits
with each chunk specifying 32 bits of the desired cpumask.
So
((NR_CPUS + 32) / 32) * 8 + 1
(8 hex characters for each 32 cpus, and 1 extra character for null 
terminator)
would be an upper bound that would accomodate all the cpus for sure.
Thoughts ?
