I'm writing a kernel file server. Unlike NFS, clients send me full paths
so I need to translate them to their respective inodes before calling
->open(...).
The reason I didn't use filp_open() in the first place is because it calls 
get_empty_filp() and, when I started writing this thing, didn't really understand
and so I thought it was better for me to call open_namei() directly and duplicate
some of the stuff that was going on in filp_open(). Now I see that there is a better
solution. 
Thanks Alexander.
