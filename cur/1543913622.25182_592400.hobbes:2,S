It's 2.6.22.6. I'm thinking a fix would be to add "select PM" to
X86_64_ACPI_NUMA.
I'm also thinking that maybe K8_NUMA should be changed from "depends on
PCI" to "select PCI", like X86_64_ACPI_NUMA is. That would fix the
pseudo dependency they have between them (i.e. selecting
X86_64_ACPI_NUMA causes PCI to be selected, which then makes K8_NUMA
visible, because its PCI dependency is now satisfied).
