Well, setclock is just a small wrapper around clock or hwclock.
So, you can use these programs to look for yourself.
(i) test the RTC before rebooting.
date is no good, it reads the system time, not the RTC.
Use clock -r, or hwclock --show.
(ii) test the RTC after rebooting.
In this way you can distinguish problems in hardware /
problems in kernel / problems in hwclock / problems in user.
