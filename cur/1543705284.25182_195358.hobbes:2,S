Does 'hdparm -I /dev/hda" work?  If so can you try this patch?
It reverts taskfile code to use old (non-taskfile) order of accessing
port registers for ATAPI identify command.  This is a good starting point.
If CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO is N code just ignores BUSY status of a drive
and reads some random data.  I would like to have this problem solved
at least instead of adding the same workaround to CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO.
Cheers,
