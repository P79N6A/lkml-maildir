here's some test results, comparing SD-latest to Mike's-latest:
re-testing the weak points of the vanilla scheduler + Mike's:
 - thud.c:    this workload has almost unnoticeable effect
 - fiftyp.c:  noticeable, but alot better than previously!
re-testing the weak points of SD:
 - hackbench: still unusable under such type of high load - no improvement.
 - make -j:   still less interactive than Mike's - no improvement.
