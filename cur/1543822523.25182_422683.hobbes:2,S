Was about to do that when I stopped because I was thinking I'd need to
keep track of which namespace had been copied before a failaure, for
the sake of clone.
But of course I don't have to - copy_nsproxy could do the cleanup itself
on failure.
So this should be a nice little cleanup - especially as # namespaces
increases.

Not getting this.  Are you saying the uts_data would be a copy of
the contents of *uts_ns, or that uts_ns points to nsproxy->uts_data?
If the latter, then just unsharing uts_ns but not mounts namespace
is no longer possible, right?
