I hope count isn't provided by userspace here ?

On i386, you'll sleep implicitly waiting for the page fault to be handled;  in
the generic case, anything could happen.

No.  It would be portable if you were using memcpy_fromuser_toio and it
existed.

current should be fine if you're not in a bh/interrupt/kernel thread.
