I have reread the first mail in this series - I would say that Bug#2 is much
worse than Bug#1. This since Bug#1 is "only" a performance problem,
but Bug#2 is about correctness...
Are you 100% sure that tux works with rmap?
I would suggest testing the simplest possible case.
* Standard kernel
* concurrent dd:s
What can your problem be:
* something to do with the VM - but the problem is in several different VMs...
* something to do with read ahead? you got some patch suggestions -
  please use them on a standard kernel, not rmap (for now...)
