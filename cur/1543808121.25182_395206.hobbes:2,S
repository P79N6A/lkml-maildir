Sure.

No.  About a million years ago I had a make-alloc_pages-fail-at-1%-rate
debug patch.  Doing that again would be an interesting exercise.
Another option is to only fail userspace allocations (__GFP_HIGHMEM is set,
or a new flag in GFP_HIGHUSER).  For the workloads which the NUMA guys care
about I expect this is a 99% solution and the amount of code which it puts
at risk is vastly less.
