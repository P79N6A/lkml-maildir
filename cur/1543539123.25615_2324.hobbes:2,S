Hi,
I would like to get proper core files in my linux mt application if I get
any signals like segv, sigbus etc.  Currently either manager threads becomes
'defunct' or the main thread dumps core. ( I agree that this is according to
the Linux thread documentatiion)  But this makes developement very difficult
since we don't know the actual reason for  the application to crash.
I appreciate any kind of help
thanks,
-jcj
