Indeed, but as I pointed out in another mail it actually works if you
set some rules:
1) List insert and delete is only allowed on local CPU lists.
2) List traversal is allowed on remote CPU lists.
I bet we could get all of the per-cpu users to abide by this
rule if we wanted to.
The remaining issue with accessing per-cpu areas at multiple virtual
addresses is D-cache aliasing.
