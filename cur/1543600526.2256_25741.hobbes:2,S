Hi!
In recent 2.4.x kernels the "Cache: " line in /proc/cpuinfo
reports the amount of the L1 cache or L2 cache or L3 cache or
some combination of them, depending on what code is executed
for this ( different for different CPU types ).
Somebody should decide what information should be reported in that
line and then fix the code.
Party on !
