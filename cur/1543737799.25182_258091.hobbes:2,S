Why does the Linux ARM ABI have to have any relation to the ARM EABI?
The PowerPC has had two different ABIs for years, and it's not caused us
any trouble. Can't we just leave the behaviour of binutils alone when
configured for an arm-linux target, and put all feature churn into an
arm-eabi target?
