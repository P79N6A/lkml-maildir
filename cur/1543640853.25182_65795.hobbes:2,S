Readprofile ticks are not as accurate as the cycles I measured.
Moreover readprofile can give misleading information as it profiles
on timer interrupts. The alloc_skb and __kfree_skb call memory
management routines and interrupts are disabled in many parts of that code.
So I don't trust the readprofile data.
