Crap. My earlier 'empirical evidence' seems to have been happy coincidence.
After a fresh boot, I'm consistently hitting 'failed to read config rom'
failures with this patch applied. Simply putting the barrier back in gets
things working again though. Interestingly, subsequent reloading of firewire-*
modules less the barrier also tend to work until the system is rebooted.
