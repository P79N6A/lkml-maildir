Oh, in that case there are no PCI users of this at all, and what the PCI 
driver does is immaterial ;)

No no. The rule would be that a PCI driver - if it uses the new 
infrastructure, which apparently nobody does _as_ a PCI driver - simply 
would never do the whole "pci_set_power_state(PCI_D3hot)" etc crud AT ALL.
So a PCI driver would only do higher-level stuff in its suspend/resume 
code. For example, a USB host controller would initiate the USB bus level 
stuff, and likely just stop the controller (not suspend it - just stop 
it).
