PAGE_COPY (without the write bit) is used when the area was mmap'ed
MAP_PRIVATE: which indeed is asking for private copies of pages to
be made - which will be left containing the data written there by the
application, rather than shared data received later by the driver.
You want to mmap MAP_SHARED, which will use PAGE_SHARED instead,
including the write bit, both before and after the mprotects.
There should be no problem then: do you actually see a problem
when MAP_SHARED is used?
(You don't mention which release you're describing, and some of
the details may vary: the not-yet-started 2.6.19 is likely to use
PAGE_COPY even when MAP_SHARED, to help it keep track of the number
of dirty pages; but in that case, do_wp_page() won't make a copy.)

Not if PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED I think.

When MAP_PRIVATE, it's not the page being locked that causes the copy
(it's not normally locked there, is it?), it's that it's not PageAnon;
or if you're looking at 2.6.12 or older, that page_count is raised.

No!  That would give every user write access to shared files they
should have no write access to.

Not just the ZERO_PAGE: initial program data is another common example.
