For lack of clear insight into this, I thought I might put this out for 
opinions.
We're examining autofs and issues customers are having with it.  One of 
the issues that came up during discussions of things we can do is 
namespaces.
Does anyone have any ideas how namespaces and autofs ought to play 
together?  There are some obvious answers, but it seems to me that they 
might not be correct.
Anyone out there want to throw some ideas out?  We can just ignore it, 
but that isn't exactly nice.  What we really need is some guidance on 
what kind of sematics are "correct".
Tim
