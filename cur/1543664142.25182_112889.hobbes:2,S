Hah!  Indeed, thank you for setting me straight.

Yes, I'd tried block dev larger than RAM, with and without swap:
no luck.  Perhaps my disks somehow keep up with the stuff coming
down from /dev/zero but yours don't?  (No disgrace!)  But never mind,
Andrew has a surer way to hit it.

Andrew's patch for this is a thing of great beauty, a shining beacon
to inspire all whose eyes are graced by it.  But I'd still have liked
to understand why it's needed in your case not mine: it's a bit
embarrassing for me to claim I have patches for various loopmem
hangs, yet be unable to reproduce this.
