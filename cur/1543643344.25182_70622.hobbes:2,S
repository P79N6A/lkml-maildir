Subject: [PATCH] USER_HZ & SG problem [timeouts]

Hi!
One of the places in the kernel where HZ is interfaced with userspace
is in the SG driver. With HZ different from USER_HZ this may result
in all kinds of unexpected timeouts when using SG.
This patch is an attempt to fix this by transforming USER_HZ based timing to
HZ based timing an v.v. A problem I know of is the fact that SG_GET_TIMEOUT
may return a different value than the value that was passed on with
SG_SET_TIMEOUT.  Depending on its impact this may need to be solved by
adding a field "user_timeout" to Sg_fd which contains the USER_HZ based value.
Cheers,
Rolf
