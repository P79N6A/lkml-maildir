Sounds good to me.
In another message you mentioned keeping linux/modules as a staging
area.  I am neutral on that.
In another message you mention:

I prefer an 11-second procedure that works correctly to a 3-second
process that is full of bugs.
I know how to cut out a decent chunk of the recursive Make overhead.
Look at this section:
	#
	# Get things started.
	#
	first_rule: sub_dirs
	        $(MAKE) all_targets
This causes two recursive invocations per directory level.  Instead,
try this:
	# Get things started.
	first_rule: sub_dirs all_targets
	# Require that sub_dirs be done before all_targets.
	all_targets: sub_dirs
The second rule is needed to guarantee the order of execution in
parallel builds (descend the subdirectories first because sometimes
targets in the current directory depend on them).
