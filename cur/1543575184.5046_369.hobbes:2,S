	Huh?
	How disabled do you want it.  It can't even be enabled unless
you enabled experimental code options.  Then, it's disabled by default
and you first have to enable the R/O NTFS.  Then you have to explicitly
select the option to enable RW access that is clearly labeled DANGEROUS.
This thing is not armed and dangerous due to an act of ommision.  It's
live and active only through three acts of commision.
	About the only thing left, short of removing it from the kernel
entirely, is to make the option a hidden control option, like some of the
debugging options, that requires editing a header file or a Makefile to
enable.  Is that what you are looking for?
