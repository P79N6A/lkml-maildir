Asking for the kernel config.h won't cut it on its own.  The preprocessor
directive:
#include <linux/config.h>
will pickup up the _pcmcia_ config.h due to "-I../include" being specified
first in the include search sequence.
Also, asm/pgtable.h must directly include asm/page.h.
For a quick workaround, try applying this to the kernel tree (in
include/asm):
