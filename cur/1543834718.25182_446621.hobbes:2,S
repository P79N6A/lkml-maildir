I started running a baseline test on Thursday, July 13th,
and continued until today.  The system was not running
cpufreq but it was using TSC as the sole gtod timesource.
Here's the numbers (again, after 12 days uptime):

Compared to the same machine, immediately after reboot:

I don't see any significant drift.  It looks to me like 
current generation Opterons are TSC-safe.
Joachim was supposed to be collecting the data for the system
with PN! enabled, if he hasn't posted it already.
