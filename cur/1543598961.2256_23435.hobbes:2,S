Maybe because I have ''been there done that''! This is exactly how
things were when we brought up the ia64 port.

Do you have any idea how dlopen() actually works? It requires you to
have dynamic loading working, that means shared libraries ... please
do us a favor and go read the code in glibc in elf/*.c and
sysdep/<some-arch>/dl-machine.h (plus a couple of other
files). Implementing shared library support is ''very interesting''
but it's by far the first thing you do on a new system.
That aside, I am not aware whether Python2 actually requires dlopen to
work well enough to run CML2.

Well I can tell you that most people would like to compile their
kernels on the host even BEFORE they get shared libraries going.
Ok, I think I have spent enough time on this discussion now, back to
hacking.
