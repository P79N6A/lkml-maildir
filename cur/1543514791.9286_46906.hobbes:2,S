In lilo.conf use the option (in the image section of the kernel you want to
boot):
append="mem=120M"
If you have 120 Mb of memory. Linux kernel > 2.0.0 should automatically
detect this.
Also don't forget to rerun lilo to make the changes effective.

You have to recompile the kernel and enable SMP support.
