make modules_install only installs the modules that you compiled.  Are
you sure that you selected sound as modules?  If you think that sound
modules should have been built, make your .config available, together
with the output from "ls -lR /lib/modules/2.2.17".

You should not mix modules from different kernels unless you know
exactly what you are doing.  It is not a recommended procedure.
