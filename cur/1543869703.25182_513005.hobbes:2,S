That's my point, this is the *only* way working at the moment when
using mdadm --assemble , since /dev/disk/by-id* tells me no suiteable
drives, /dev/sd? DOES work but isnt reliable since /dev/sdl is not
always /dev/sdl but can be /dev/sdc the next reboot :D

I know, and i use mdadm. I used to use /dev/sd? since I did a simple
migration from raidtools to mdadm and this was the easiest way, then I
started to use libata which mangled my drive order every reboot, so I
got adviced to use /dev/disk/by-id/* , and now I am using UUID=some
128 bits hash here

Well, what I am kinda trying to say is: function that used to work
prior to 2.6.20 doesn't seem to be working anymore :D
mdadm -assemble doesn't work with /dev/disk/by-id/* is used.
And /dev/sd? is not useable due to the drive order not being the same
after every reboot, but this is more a libata/udev problem I guess.
I am in the train now, I will do the mdadm -v thingy as soon as I am
at a somewhat more stable connection than 2Mbit HDPSA
