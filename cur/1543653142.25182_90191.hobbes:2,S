This is pretty hard to do in some configurations. You essentially have to do 
this at the router, not at destination.

Recent IETF work on link-local has used TTL=255 outgoing, and it has to be 255 
at the receive end too. That is a reasonable way to ensure that is is 
link-local, since even the most brain-dead routers will at least decrement 
TTL.
