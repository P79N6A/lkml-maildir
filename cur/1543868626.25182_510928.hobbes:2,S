I don't believe that.  Command timeouts never happen on healthy systems,
unless we have a driver bug.  Okay, so I can imagine a pathological case
of a full queue (NCQ) with all 32 commands taking longer than usual due
to ECC retries in the firmware..
But in real life, on a desktop, timeouts never happen as a normal event.
I wonder what's *really* wrong here?
