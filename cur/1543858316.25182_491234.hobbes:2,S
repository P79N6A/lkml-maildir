It's a stupid test module for the uio core for isa devices.  It's not
the main code, or core.

I agree, that's why this code doesn't let userspace sort it out.  You
have to have a kernel driver to handle the irq.

I agree.  But that's all that this test module did.  It handled an isa
interrupt that was edge triggered.

Ok, I can pull this example module out if you want, but people seem to
want examples these days.  If I do that, any objection to the rest?
