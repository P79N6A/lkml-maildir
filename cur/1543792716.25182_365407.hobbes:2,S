+klog and relay-apps example code
+================================
+
+relayfs itself is ready to use, but to make things easier, a couple
+simple utility functions and a set of examples are provided.
+
+The relay-apps example tarball, available on the relayfs sourceforge
+site, contains a set of self-contained examples, each consisting of a
+pair of .c files containing boilerplate code for each of the user and
+kernel sides of a relayfs application; combined these two sets of
+boilerplate code provide glue to easily stream data to disk, without
+having to bother with mundane housekeeping chores.
+
+The 'klog debugging functions' patch (klog.patch in the relay-apps
+tarball) provides a couple of high-level logging functions to the
+kernel which allow writing formatted text or raw data to a channel,
+regardless of whether a channel to write into exists or not, or
+whether relayfs is compiled into the kernel or is configured as a
+module.  These functions allow you to put unconditional 'trace'
+statements anywhere in the kernel or kernel modules; only when there
+is a 'klog handler' registered will data actually be logged (see the
+klog and kleak examples for details).
+
+It is of course possible to use relayfs from scratch i.e. without
+using any of the relay-apps example code or klog, but you'll have to
+implement communication between userspace and kernel, allowing both to
+convey the state of buffers (full, empty, amount of padding).

-whether a channel to write into exists or not, or whether relayfs is

-the kernel counterpart of userspace librelay.c, combined these two
-files provide glue to easily stream data to disk, without having to
-bother with housekeeping.  klog and relay-app can be used together,
-with klog providing high-level logging functions to the kernel and
-relay-app taking care of kernel-user control and disk-logging chores.

+Creating non-relay files
+------------------------
+
+relay_open() automatically creates files in the relayfs filesystem to
+represent the per-cpu kernel buffers; it's often useful for
+applications to be able to create their own files in the relayfs
+filesystem as well e.g. 'control' files used to communicate control
+information between the kernel and user sides of a relayfs
+application.  For this purpose the relayfs_create_file() and
+relayfs_remove_file() API functions exist.  For relayfs_create_file(),
+the caller passes in a set of user-defined file operations to be used
+for the file and an optional void * to a user-specified data item,
+which will be accessible via inode->u.generic_ip (see the relay-apps
+tarball for examples).
