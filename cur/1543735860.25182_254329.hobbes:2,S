I guess I'll have to convert 1340 lines of ipchains commands to
iptables -yech!
I had convert something to ipchains a couple of years ago.
That's when I only had to kill-off only about 100 spam-hosts.
Now I gotta convert again. Soon they'll be replacing `ls`
with `echo *` and nothing will work.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
