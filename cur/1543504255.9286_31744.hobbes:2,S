Well, at least in my (in progress) patch to give all threads the same pid,
I will be providing a second system call to get the task ID, which under a
pure kernel-mode threads implementation like LinuxThreads will be unique
to the thread.  I don't know of anyone else working on the same thing, but
if someone is, no comment on whether they will be doing the same.
