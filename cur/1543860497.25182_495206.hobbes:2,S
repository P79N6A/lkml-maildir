It's not actually.  For flush_anon_page() we currently have to flush the
user mapping and the kernel mapping.  For flush_dcache_page(), it's
exactly the same - we have to flush the kernel mapping and the user
mapping.
So having both calls in get_user_pages() actually means we end up flushing
the kernel mapping _twice_ for every page.  _That_ is overkill.
As Dave points out, flush_dcache_page() _should_ take care of anonymous
pages as well (which if you remember was my argument to James, who
absolutely refused to accept it.)
So, since Dave is in agreement with me, I'll be handling this issue as
per the interface designer's (Dave's) suggestions which tie up directly
with my understanding of what should be done in the first place.
