got this error while patching (against 2.5.24 tarball):
can't find file to patch at input line 1696
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?
The text leading up to this was:
--------------------------
|===== BitKeeper/etc/ignore 1.21 vs 1.22 =====
|--- 1.21/BitKeeper/etc/ignore  Mon Jun 17 23:06:10 2002

--------------------------
after removing this file from the patch it applies cleanly!
make mrproper works (no more unknown directories)
but I got this error after `make KBUILD_VERBOSE= KBUILD_MODULES=1 bzImage`:
<snip>
  CC     drivers/char/keyboard.o
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `defkeymap.o', needed by `built-in.o'.  
Stop.
make[1]: *** [char] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
so now defkeymap.c is not generated (it was removed in 2.5.24)
manually generating it works but then this happened:
<snip>
  CC     arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.o
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `vmlinux.scr', needed by `piggy.o'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [compressed/vmlinux] Error 2
make: *** [bzImage] Error 2

I'm not using a bitkeeper tree, but the bitkeeper tree and the tarball should 
be the same...
