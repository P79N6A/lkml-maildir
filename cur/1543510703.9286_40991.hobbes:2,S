I looked into this problem again after appearance of 2.3.18ac9 (BTW, the
EXTRAVERSION in the ac9 patch still says ac8).  I didn't have any luck,
but, by increasing debug levels, I found what I hope is a clue for my
betters.
dmesg output after increasing debug level for 2.3.18ac9:
Found 3c900 Boomerang 10baseT at PCI address 0xec00, IRQ 11.
Found Digital DC21041 Tulip at PCI address 0xea000000, IRQ 11.
dmesg output from 2.2.12
eth0: 3Com 3c900 Boomerang 10baseT at 0xec00,  00:10:4b:b3:8a:92, IRQ 11
eth1: Digital DC21041 Tulip at 0xe800, 21041 mode, 00 c0 f0 37 22 56,
IRQ 11.
Is the 0xe800 vs 0xea00 significant?  I'm clueless here.
