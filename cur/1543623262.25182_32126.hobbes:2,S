Misunderstanding, rather.
Swapfiles aren't interesting, IMO.  And I agree that mkswap or swapon
should just barf if the file has any holes in it.
But what I refer to here is, simply, delayed allocate for swapspace.
So swap_out() sticks the target page into the swapcache, marks it
dirty and takes a space reservation for the page out of the swapcache's
address_space.  But no disk space is allocated at swap_out() time.
Instead, the real disk mapping is created when the VM calls
a_ops->vm_writeback() against the swapcache page's address_space.  
All of which rather implies a ripup-and-rewrite of half the swap
code.  It would certainly require a new allocator. So I just mentioned
the possibility.  Glad you're interested :)
