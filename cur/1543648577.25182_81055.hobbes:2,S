Agreed, I'll let a user of this function speak up on how they intend to
address the problem.  I'm through arguing for this hook.

Note for the readers, this is 32K on Sparc, on i386 it's much smaller as
documented yesterday.

I've run the numbers myself on OSDL machines, and seen that there is no
measurable overhead for these functions.  Sure, there is an extra
function call, and different assembler, I'll never contest that.  It's
just that I could not measure it.

It is adding stuff to the kernel.  Now if you want to call it bloat,
fine.  I like calling the USB stack bloat too, and it is bloat for
people who don't use it.  And now you can disable the option, so it will
not be bloat for you too, if you don't want it.  Argue with your
favorite distro if they enable the option that they shouldn't do that,
if they do, don't try to convince me.
And I know what my true calling in life is, but unfortunately there isn't
much calling for a professional pan flute player :)
