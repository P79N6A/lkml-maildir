True, but for many machines, the MAC address is enough for someone
knowledgeable to (at least) determine what the manufacturer of your
machine is, and in many cases, the model number of your laptop (since
MAC addresses are assigned sequentially) and thus people can have a
very good idea of the contents of your PCI tree ---- if for some
reason anyone would even care, of course!
