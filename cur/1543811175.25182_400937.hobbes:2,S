Not really.  The only energy you're saving is that your CPU fan
will turn slightly slower, which is probably going to be < 1W
of difference.  Generated heat drop in a large room of servers
*may* mean the aircon has less to do, but I'd be surprised if
it made a noticable difference.

You should be able to modify cpuspeed or some other userspace
governor to do this quite easily.
