I can't recall the exact details (it's been a year since I looked at the
code), but I believe that the VFS sets the file size before the call to
truncate, so it didn't matter on the exact semantics of the punch call.
Truncate still existed, but it was just a wrapper calling the punch code
to punch out all of the existing blocks.
