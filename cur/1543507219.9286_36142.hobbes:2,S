My scsi-card don't work after I recomplied the kernel. It hangs at boot
up with the following messages on the screen. repeated printing on the
screen.
"Referenced SCB 13 not valid during SELTO SCSISEQ=0x5a SEQADDR=0x9
SSTATo=0x15 SSTATI=0x88".
Everthings works fine with my old Kernel (2.2.5-15, compiled of RedHat).
The scsi-card I use is Adaptec 2940UW Pro.
I probably missed samething when I configure the new kernel. Are there
anyone with ides what could be missing ?
