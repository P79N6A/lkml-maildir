What bug does this patch fix?  What is your .config?  I'm not having any
compile problems on my NUMAQ lately.

Am I reading this wrong, or does this just move the option down a bit?
Did you need to change the link order?  Why?

It's really weird, but I'd hope that there was a reason for having two

That said, it does boot on my 16-way NUMAQ, but I still have no real
idea what problem this is solving or what it is actually doing ;)
