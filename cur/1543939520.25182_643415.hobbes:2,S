Ah, OK.
I'm happy to implement logic to display the all missing options.  I  
should have updated nfs_show_mount_options() when I wrote the NFS  
mount option parser.
Let me know your preference.

For NFS, umount also needs to read some of the options in order to  
determine how mountd is to connect to the server for the unmount.   
(That's why we have addr= in the first place).
