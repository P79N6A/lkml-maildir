BOYD MUNRO REQUESTS YOUR PROXY FOR AOPA'S ANNUAL MEETING

proxy for the Annual General Meeting at Echuca on Saturday.

PLEASE ALLOW ME TO BE YOUR PROXY OR BETTER STILL JOIN ME AT
AOPA's ANNUAL MEETING - SATURDAY 29TH MAY, 4:30PM, ECHUCA AIRPORT
AOPA's voting rules were changed this year.  They were changed
in a way which disadvantaged members of the fax brigade and the
e-mail brigade.  As a result of the changed rules, my vote in
the AOPA elections was rejected, as were at least 154 others.
Had these votes been counted, a "winning margin" of 37 votes
would have become a losing margin of probably more than 200.
Votes were rejected for a variety of reasons, principally because
they were not on the official form, or because the member had the
temerity to change his or her mind.  Quite a lot of people did
not receive the official form.  Their attempts to vote were
peremptorily rejected.  It was like winding the clock back to
1994 - it's all the member's fault.  It's not up to AOPA to
ensure that each member receives an official ballot paper, it's
up to the member to make sure he or she hunts one down.
One person even cut a copy of the official form out of the
magazine, filled it in and voted by mail.  That vote too was
rejected.  I would very much like to hear from that person to
understand why he or she did it that way.  No doubt there was a
reason, for example that there was no official form enclosed in
his copy of the magazine.  But whatever the reason, the voter's
intention was absolutely clear, and he or she was denied a vote.
That vote should have been counted (and incidentally it was cast
contrary to my recommendation).
Another person's vote was rejected because he was allegedly non-
financial.  He says he was financial.  But he'd never have known
his vote was rejected if he had not enquired.  AOPA did not
contact him to say his vote was going to be disallowed because
he was non-financial.  AOPA did not use the opportunity to sell
him an extra year's membership so his vote would count.  AOPA
simply rejected his vote.  Guess who this "non-financial" member
voted for?
Mike Kalinowski, who acted as a scrutineer at the count, tells
me that votes were divided into three categories - formal,
informal, and invalid.  That alone tells you plenty.  He also
says that votes from allegedly non-financial members had been
excluded before the count began, and were not available for
scrutiny.  That means we have no idea how many such votes were
excluded, nor was there any opportunity to check whether the
relevant people really were unfinancial or not.  The message is
this:
IF YOU VOTED FOR ANYONE OTHER THAN THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM, SEND AN
E-MAIL TO AOPA NOW <mark@aopa.com.au> AND ASK WHETHER OR NOT YOUR
VOTE WAS COUNTED
Don't be put off by generalities about HOW votes were counted.
Demand to know if your own vote was counted.
The Returning Officer has refused to answer some members'
questions on the grounds that I might take legal action against
him.  I certainly might, unless he can give me clear reasons why
he did not count my vote.  But the mere fact that I might take
legal action against him about my vote is no reason at all why
he should not answer your questions about your vote, and about
anything else to do with the AOPA "election".
WHERE IS AOPA HEADED NOW?
If the present Committee of AOPA remains entrenched, the present
appalling results will continue.  We will continue to get one
unpleasant legislative surprise after another.  AOPA's members
voted to remove one of the members of the committee and replace
him with MIKE KALINOWSKI, who is a proven watchdog.  AOPA has
chosen to ignore the members' wishes.
WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT THIS?
One thing you can do is to give me your Proxy for the 1999 Annual
General Meeting (AGM).  That means that you allow me to vote on
your behalf at the AGM.  I request that you give me your proxy
by faxing the following form IMMEDIATELY to AOPA on 02 9791 9355.
Don't waste a moment, because proxies have to be lodged 48 hours
before the meeting and AOPA may well try to extend that period
in order to exclude proxies.
