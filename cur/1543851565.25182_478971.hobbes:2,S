If you believe you need a semaphore for protecting a mostly read structure, 
then RCU is certainly a good candidate. (ie no locked operation at all)
The problem with a per_cpu biglock is that you may consume a lot of RAM for 
big NR_CPUS. Count 32 KB per 'biglock' if NR_CPUS=1024

Hum, please dont use *lazy*, this could make Andi unhappy :)
What are you calling semaphore exactly ?
Did you read Documentation/mutex-design.txt ?
