Very odd...  There were no changes between pre9 and pre10 that
directly relate to the nfs server, and none that immediately jump out
at me that could cause a slowdown in NFS writes.
What architecture?  PPC saw a lot of updates.
What filesystem?  jfs saw one change
What storage device?  IDE or SCSI?
Can you try going back to -pre9 and confirm that performance comes
back?
