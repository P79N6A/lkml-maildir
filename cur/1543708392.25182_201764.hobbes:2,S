You could do it in the kernel, by using a stackable filesystem and tweaking 
the readdir file operation to do what you want. Then you can mount it on top 
of the root filesystem, and all accesses will pass through it, where you hold 
back the files a user shouldn't see.
On www.filesystems.org you can find bare stackable filesystem templates by 
Erez Zadoc, but maybe you could even use the high level Fist language to 
generate such a filesystem.
Just an idea...
