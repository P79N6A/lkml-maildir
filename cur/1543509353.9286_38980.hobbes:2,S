Not "formally". But every now and then Linus or someone else posts something
to linux-kernel that elaborates on what they like to see done. I dimly recall
that there may also be something in the FAQ about it - have you read it?

Assuming you addressed this to Alan, I certainly don't regard him as a
'marketing front man' particularly. I don't know whether he does, but I doubt
it somehow.

Well, for starters, the patchlevel (middle number) tells you whether it's
a stable version or not. You generally won't get new core features (i.e.
something that affects other code) into a stable release.

I guess the main version number (left-most) is kind of like that.

If you mean, "submit material for a non-standard branch", then just create
a mailing list for the non standard branch, get people interested in said
branch to join it, and bob's your unicorn.

Nothing to stop people publishing non-standard branches. Alan does it, and I
think Andrea has periodically as well. And of course there are the ELKS people,
and so on.

Anyone who's got the source to both branches can do this.

The kernel's GPL'd. Anyone can roll their own branch, and distribute it. This
is in fact what the distribution vendors do. Admittedly they don't tend to
deviate much, but that's not really relevant.

It /is/ "open-sourced" (ugh); that is, it's GPL'd and as such complies with
the OSI's open source definition and the DFSG, which are pretty much the
de-facto standards for the definition of "open source".
Can we drop this now? Or at least go to email?
