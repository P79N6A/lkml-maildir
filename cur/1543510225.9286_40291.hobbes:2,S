Ok, folks, I think we are talking about "udi_pio_trans" call
(in UDI Physical I/O Specification) and this call is surely not meant
to perform a single I/O port or MMIO read/write. Instead the UDI
implementation executes a large transaction including many
reads, writes, arithmetic operations, branches, etc.
Now, the overhead is by no means in the call, it's in interpreting
the transaction description and I'd say yes, it ought to be rather big.

I've seen that one, I just think is too adventurous to judge about
branch performance based on an ISA spec.
