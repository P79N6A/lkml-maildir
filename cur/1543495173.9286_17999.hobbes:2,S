cd /net/anotherserver/myhome/subdir
vi t.tex
ZZ (exit with no modifications)
and Boom! the machine hangs. Even magic sysreq doesn't work.
The nfs directory is automounted by amd form am_utils (RH 5.2).
rsize=8192,wsize=8192,intr. The other end runs 2.0.36 with userspace nfs
server.
Running the same thing on the console shows several oopses that don't get
logged. The last one and a half were on the screen and they were from
init. I will try the oops pause patch and write down and decode the
results.
This doesn't happen with 2.2.7, 2.2.7ac[12] not tested.
strace of vim doing the same work with 2.2.7:

(here I press ZZ to exit vim)
...

unlink("/.automount/ondatra/root/home/mroos/work/.t.tex.swp") = 0
One of the last 2 lines makes it hang.
