I'm not sure where the nonexistent file comes from.  According to the
printf statement, you're trying to unlink a file with no links, so it
would be interesting to see if 622295 is a valid inode number (it
should be, or there would have been more error messages).  Doing
dumpe2fs -h /dev/hda3
may help to find out where this bogus inode came from.
These block numbers decode to ASCII data:
540028982 = 0x20303036 = " 336"
540024880 = 0x20302030 = " 3 3"
170926128 = 0x0a302030 = "\n3 3"
There were problems like this quite a while ago (block numbers that are
really ASCII data)...  I can't recall what the problem turned out to be
at that time.
I would suggest a full fsck to start with (you have probably already
done so).  If you haven't done a full fsck on this filesystem in a long
time, there is a chance the corruption was from the old kernel bug.
Cheers, Andreas
