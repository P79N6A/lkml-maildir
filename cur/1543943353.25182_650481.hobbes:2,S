The standar says literally that sections cannot overlap... but your
interpretation is rigth anyway.
I have a lot of binaries in my host Linux system with some section
overlapping with .bss wich are correctly loaded (so this should not be
the problem).
Well, let's follow searching...
I already tested the filesystem (in order to discard a flash corruption).
