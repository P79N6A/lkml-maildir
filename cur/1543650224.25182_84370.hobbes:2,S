So this is just a "better be safe than sorry" thing? Obviously my data 
survived since I copied ~60 GB onto the drive running in UDMA33 mode. :)
What kind of problems would that be? A long time ago I had a 1.2 GB WD drive 
where forcing any DMA mode would result in massive data shredding.
Meaning: once it works in UDMA there is nothing to worry about?
Thanks for the quick answer.
