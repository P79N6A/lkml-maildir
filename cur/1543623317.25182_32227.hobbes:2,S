Ah, OK -- my apologies.  Then, a few things need to be checked:
	- atm_dev_register (ignoring its callees) does not need a lock
	- every callee of atm_dev_register that does need the lock
	  acquires and releases it itself (this is good design, too)
I suspect the second point may be missing the releases in cases, since
those spin_unlocks were in the code.
