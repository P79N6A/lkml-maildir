Subject: [PATCH] (linux 2.4.25) hangup on disconnect for usbserial module
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is "reasonably well tested" on the x86 platform.
This patch fixes a problem where the usbserial code would not notify
connected programs that the serial port was going away.
