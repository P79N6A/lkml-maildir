Yes, and of course it's much better even than that: for most cases,
the filesystem is only involved in the decision over where to find the
data on disk.  Once we have done that lookup, the process of setting
up the cache and submitting the IO can be performed without any
interactions with the filesystem.  The filesystem itself is just a
small part of the mechanism used to read and write data.
