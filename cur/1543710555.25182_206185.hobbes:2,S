As far as I know, the new preffered way of handling modules, is to load 
them when device is detected (hotplug and udev, at boot or later) 
and (optionally) remove when device is removed, not as in older kernels, 
when module was added or removed depending on its use. This way (as 
opposed to monolithic kernel) you can have "generic" kernel by placing 
everything in modules. And what is the point in unloading not currently 
needed modules? They should not use much resources when not needed...
And if you want to put your system to sleep, you must put to sleep all 
devices (in the right order) *including* these not currently used but 
present in the system. If you will not do this, you can probably get big 
crash. So you need loaded module, that knows how to put device to sleep.
