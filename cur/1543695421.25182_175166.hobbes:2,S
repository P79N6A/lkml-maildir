It probally got line-wrapped when I copied
and pasted into outlook.
So Here's the patch in tarball.  
In addition, also try the ftp site: 
ftp://ftp.lsil.com/HostAdapterDrivers/linux/Fusion-MPT/2.05.10/
Please let me know if your still haveing problems
with applying the patch. It should apply cleanly.
