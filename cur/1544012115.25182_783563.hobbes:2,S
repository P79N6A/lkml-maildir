I'm not suggesting that. The *_EOF registers are all 32 bits on the *same*
register. And these 32 interrupts are inherently occupied by ipu_idmac.c
as you cannot request a idmac channel without requesting this interrupt.
So at the moment you are passing 32 bits of the same register through a
chained interrupt handler and *all* these interrupts go to the very same
interrupt handler.
For the corresponding 32 error interrupts it's probably also the idmac
engine that has to react to these interrupts, not the drivers using it.
Not sure about the remaining assorted interrupts.

No, it's not working. The overlay framebuffer maybe there, but it's
configured to be invisible.

And in the meantime we maintain known to be broken code?
