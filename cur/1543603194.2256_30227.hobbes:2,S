I agree with you that there's a risk. Mike Harris had
written a
patch for 2.2 which did something similar, but
slightly better 
IMO since it avoids risks of mis-press, handles
correctly
broken keyboards and keeps compatible with the
existing 
method. Basically, it allows the user to press Alt,
then SysRQ,
release SysRQ then press the desired key, and later
release
Alt. In fact, it only resets the "magic-key-mode" flag
after Alt
has been released, and doesn't bother when SysRq is
released.
I don't remember where it was available, but if
someone needs
it, I still have it here for 2.2.
Willy
