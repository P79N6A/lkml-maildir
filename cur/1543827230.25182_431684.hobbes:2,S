i_cindex is set by fs/char_dev.h, and the only user of that field (I
grepped the entire sources) is ./drivers/ieee1394/ieee1394_core.h:
   /* return the index (within a minor number block) of a file */
   static inline unsigned char ieee1394_file_to_instance(struct file *file)
   {
	return file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_cindex;
   }

You're right, I added some fields which can't be moved out of struct
inode, but the basic point remains; it should be possible to shrink
struct inode by moving fields to an inode_state structure.
As far as i/dnotify fields are concerned, yes, they can be used on an
unopened inode, but we could also simply consider a file that is being
watched by i/dnotify as one that is "opened" from the point of view of
needing a inode_state structure to be allocated.  Depending on how
many files a typical GUI desktop is going to watch, this might or
might not be good idea.
