That's part of the problem.
I'm able to bind scancodes to keycodes (setkeykodes), and use loadkeys
with using KeyboardSignal to send a signal to init, which spawns an
executable. But then (when multiple keys defined to be on that
KeyboardSignal, it's not possible to find out which key was pressed and
not which user.
For the first problem (finding out which key has been pressed) one could
think about extending keyboard.c:spec_fn_table with additional functions,
and modify init to understand them. But i'm not sure thats the way to go.
Problem 2 (finding ut wich user pressed the key) stays.
Perhaps it's an idea to let loadkeys _understand_ (if possible) an "exec"
primitive more or less similar to the string option ?

Argh!  All right, so how am I supposed to work with Linux when
everything's already been done?!  Can't these people leave some
broken MSDOS like parts so there's problems left to solve!?....
