Hmmm.  I've tried doing this: while true; do cat /proc/apm; done > /dev/null
I then open and close XMMS a few times and plug/unplug my AC adapter
trying to get something to happen.  I haven't had any luck.  The
frustrating part is that I've had the problem before.  I just can't get
it to do it now.
BTW, I have a Thinkpad T21.  Do any of you have a non-IBM notebook?
