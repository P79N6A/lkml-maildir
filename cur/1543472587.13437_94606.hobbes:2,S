With the same argument, why not also guarantee him a govt loan since 
he may not be able to raise the money?

One must accept that life is not all roses, and certainly *no one* is going to
help you to get ahead. A equalibium of good and bad is how nature works.
Your personal drive, intellect, and a good amount of luck, are all you have to
rely on.
The government can do about as must to ensure success as it can to create jobs.
(as if another burecratic on a tax funded salery is somehow productive... : P)
Ultimatly the same powers you asked the govt to exercise for you are going to
be used exercised right AGAINST you by the people that have already made it,
have influence, and want to protect their OWN interests. 
This stands true for much more then just this patent issue.

And WHO decides what is patentable? (Who decides what is decent? What is moral?
What is 'fair'?)
By presenting a collective power, you have no way to ensure it will not be
abused.
Solution: Do not allow the power in the first place. Claim resposibility for
yourself and be strong enough to accept the good with the bad.
