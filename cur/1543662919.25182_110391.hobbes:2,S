prepare_write tells the fs which part of the page is overwritten, since 
the data is usually managed in buffer sized chunks and if the write is 
misaligned, it's needed to read a buffer from disk, so a complete buffer 
can be written back. That read is indeed syncronous.

The write is asynchronous, so the actual IO is started later. commit_write 
only marks the written buffers as dirty.
