Umm...  Maybe.  Note that this 40 is to kill very long iterations in
symlinks that are not too deeply nested, but resolving them would
traverse a lot (symlink can have a _lot_ of components - easily as much
as 2048, which leads to 2^55 lookups with depth limited to 5; since
process is unkillable during lookup and it's easy to do a setup where it
wouldn't block on IO...)
IOW, this limit doesn't come from stack overflow concerns - it's just an
arbitrary cutoff point to stop a DoS.  We can easily lift it to e.g.
256 if there's any real need.  Or make it sysctl-controlled; whatever...
The real hard limit is on nested symlinks.
