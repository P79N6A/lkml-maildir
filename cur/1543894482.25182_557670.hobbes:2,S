I do place ethical issues over technical ones, if that's what you're
asking.
And then, why should the vendor have any say on the software that runs
on the hardware I purchased from them, after the purchase?
Heck, I'd feel *safer* if I knew they couldn't modify the code in my
box without my permission.  Do you support WGA or the Sony Rootkit?
How is this any different?
But if they want to keep the ability to change the software in my box,
I want that for myself as well.  If for no other reason, in case they
mess things up.
