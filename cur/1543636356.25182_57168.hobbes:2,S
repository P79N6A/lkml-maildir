I don't agree with this, for a very simple reason.
The current rmap patch was created in order to change the
VM behaviour as little as possible and ONLY provide an
infrastructure.  Benchmarking a completely untuned thing
that was built to not change anything is bound to give
meaningless results.
I say we _use_ the infrastructure that akpm is trying to
get merged now in order to implement something useful.
