Wouldn't it be better to fix the existing config tools to output "=n"
instead of "# CONFIG_foo is not set" ?  IIRC they do the translation
back and forth internally anyway, so it should be just a matter of
removing some code from the tools.
After all, the earlier we update the config tools, the earlier we can
do something with the makefiles (after a reasonable period for things
like mconfig to catch up...)
