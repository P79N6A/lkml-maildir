Ok, good, in this case it is the 3c905C-TX (behind the bridge) that for
some reason wasn't picked up by the driver. Do you know why?
Looking at the drivers/net/3c59x.c:vortex_pci_tbl[] I find
{ 0x10B7, 0x9200, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, CH_3C905C },
and the PCI header says:
00: b7 10 00 92
so the card should be supported. Do you know why the driver doesn't pick
it up?

Tigran
