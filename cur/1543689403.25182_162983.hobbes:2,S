The great thing with ioremap_resource() is that we can make it work
for PCI IO as well as MMIO and slowly get rid of anything tapping
ports without first ioremapp'ing them. That would help some platforms
with bazillons PCI busses as well so in the end, we don't have to
keep the whole PCI IO space of those machines ioremapped all the time,
this is especially useful on 32 bits archs where we can run short on
virtual space easily.
At first, it would just "do nothing" for PCI IO (just return the same
token), and once enough drivers have been ported, the arch can decide
to change the inx/outx implementation to rely on ioremap_resource
doing the actual mapping.
