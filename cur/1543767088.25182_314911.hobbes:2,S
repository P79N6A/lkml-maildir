I prefer to avoid macros altogether, and this is one of the ways to
do it. We have had the discussion about how to define constants
a few times before on lkml without reaching a conclusion.

I want to avoid doing BUG() or something similar, so I
try to detect a user error as early as possible.

Yes, but it seems to contradict the specs...

ok.

This comes from a graphical representation in the specs. I'll add a comment
to point to that image.

ok.

Sorry, I thought I had removed that code already. This does not belong
there.

True. This is probably a bug in the comment. The code will change as soon
as the firmware provides the correct dma-window properties.
