this is not hibernate as I and many others are thinking of it.
hibernate as we are thinking would work on basicly any hardware, including 
things with no ACPI or power savings support. and the system could be in 
hibernate mode for any time period.
for that matter, after a system is put into hibernate mode the system 
could be completely disassembled and any components replaced and the 
system would work after a resume (assuming you still have access to the 
suspend image)

putting it mildly.
