It is not very easy to test. About bug - most probably it is related to third 
party ESFQ patch, i will drop it and then test more properly when i will be 
able to make watchdog work fine. But more important i notice - that iTCO_wdt 
is not working at all. I think hrtimers doesn't change anything on that.
About testing, i cannot take even small risk now(and near 3-5 days) by 
changing kernel options, i set now maximum available set of watchdogs, cause 
there is noone to maintain server, area is unreachable because of snow and 
bad weather.
Do you think reasonable to try acpi / pnpacpi with iTCO_wdt to make it work? 
Maybe just registers addresses or way how TCO watchdog activated changed on 
this chipset?
