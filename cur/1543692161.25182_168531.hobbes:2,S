Unfortunately sometimes the data transfer through stdio can be counted in 
hundreds of MB (or even in extreme cases a couple of GB), plus it is 
important to not slow down the execution of the code (we're timing and 
comparing execution speed of different approaches).  Would doing this via 
ptrace increase the runtime of the parent pid or of the child pid or both?  
ie. would this make any syscall costly timewise (stdio is either from a 
ram disk or piped to/from a generating/checking process) or would this be 
unnoticeable?
Thx,
MaZe.
