Someone posted to the LBD list last December regarding some supposedly
horrible bugs in large filesystems:

(I will admit that these were brought to my attention by that paragon of
fact-checking, a slashdot comment...)
I haven't found anything else online regarding these issues. Our initial
tests seem to indicate that it's possible to fill a 2.5TB ext3 filesystem
without corrupting the data or metadata, and as far as I and my colleagues
can understand the code it doesn't look too bad. But, before I start
loading all our production data up, I'd like to feel confident. Does this
poster know what he's talking about? Is there, or was there, any real
issue?
Running x86-32 using kernel 2.6.8 (from Debian sarge), although can always
roll my own if necessary. Preferred filesystem would be ext3, and I
anticipate no need to grow beyond the initial 2.5TB.
