I assume you're on x86-64 with CONFIG_NR_CPUS set to 255. In that case 
the max IRQ number is 256 + (32 * NR_CPUS) or 8416. The MSI interrupts 
will get assigned from highest IRQ to lowest, so you should expect to 
see such high numbers..
It appears that irqbalance's assumption that IRQ cannot exceed 255 is 
not valid on x86-64 (on i386 it is since NR_IRQS is 224).
