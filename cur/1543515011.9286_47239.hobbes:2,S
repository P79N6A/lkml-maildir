It appears that bos.net.nfs.client.4.3.2.10 is the fix for PTF U467476,
which
corrects two APARs:
  IX46187: Routing of 4.1 NFS client APARs [probably an administrative
thing]
  IY04922: The exportfs command crashes when run by non-root users
It does not appear that the NFS "off-by-one" error is included.  There is
only one APAR raised against the 4.3.2.10 level:
  IY05619: Exec format error loading /usr/lib/drivers/nfs.ext
I'm not certain, but it looks like IY05619 might be pretty pervasive.  A
fix
is currently being packaged (the APAR only closed yesterday), so I guess
that
I would hold off on bos.net.nfs.client.4.3.2.10 until it is ready.
I'm keeping an eye on an open PMR which I think is the problem.
(If anybody is wonder what on earth APARs, PTFs, and PMRs are, take the red
pill and you'll see just how far the rabbit hole goes. ;-)
