Ouch, I guess I see. If big part of time is spent in interrupt
copying data, network is going to loose packets and perform
awfully. Could he run some interrupt latency tester?
Perhaps we are copying way too much in one chunk, therefore starving
network?
Heh, old ide disk in PIO mode should allow that 6GB machine
to perform better...
At least you don't loose packets during PIO reads...
