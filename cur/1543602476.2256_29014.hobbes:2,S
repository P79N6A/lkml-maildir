Hello List,
After upgrading my kernel from 2.4.8 to the latest 2.4.10 I started getting
following error message in my logs.
	spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
Looking at /proc/interrupts showed me that interrupt 7 wasnt taken by
anything and that the ERR count was slowly increasing.
This happens on an Asus K7V with the KX133 chip and an old Athlon 700.
Since I don't have the slightest clue what a spurious interrupt is I don't
really know how to debug this.
Thanks for the help,
Michael
