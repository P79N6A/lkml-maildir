Cannot agree more. I am in a similar position right now.
My patch to aic7xxx driver was ubmitted four times
with not much reaction from scsi guys.
Finally they replied and asked to rediff it against their
git tree. I did that and sent patches back. No reply since then.
And mind you, the patch is not trying to do anything
complex, it mostly moves code around, removes 'inline',
adds 'const'. What should I think about it?
