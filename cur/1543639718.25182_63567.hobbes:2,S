I ran the test after mounting the partition as ext2 and saw a slight
decrease in performance (7-10 seconds over the duration of the test), but I
did not have time to run more than once so this could be a fluke. In general,
the `vmstat 1` output looked the same to me.

These settings bring -akpm in line with stock 2.5.31, but they are both
still slower than 2.4.19 (which itself could do better, I think).

No real change at 10%. It's consistently a second or two faster than -akpm is at
30%, but not a drastic change.

It certainly seems something is amiss. If we could actually manage to keep
the disk busy (and this is a fairly slow disk), we'd do wonderfully. But with
a 2-3 second pause every 4-5 seconds, we're transferring data barely 50% of the
time. (Yes, the pause is long enough the disk activity LED actually goes out.)
The short-term average transfer rate over the FTP connection is very
respectable for older hardware: 7-8 MB/s. But with the stalls, the overall
throughput is just over 4 MB/s.

Absolutely. I'll try whatever ideas/patches you want to throw at me.
BTW, full `vmstat 1` logs are available for all these tests if you want them.
