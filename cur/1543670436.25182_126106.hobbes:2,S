No, my point is that kstrdup() _itself_ just shouldn't be done. I don't
see it as being worthy of kernel support. Most of the kernel string data
structures are NOT random zero-ended strings anyway: they are either
strictly limited in some ways ("ends in '\0', but limited to PATH_MAX), or
they are explicitly sized ("struct qstr").
I don't much personally like C strings. Explicit lengths tend to have a
lot of advantages, and while a lot of the standard C infrastructure is for 
zero-ended strings, they do end up being even worse in the kernel than in 
user space (think buffer overflows and limited allocations in general).
