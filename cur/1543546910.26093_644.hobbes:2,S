Just to clarify, you're suggesting having a schedule_and_btw_current_is_idle
and calling this from cpu_idle(), right?  In this case the two schedules
would share quite a bit less than 99% of the code.  Idle tasks don't have to
deal with kernel lock, ->state, SCHED_YIELD and RT exhaustion, to name a few.
Instead, they might deal with more productive things such as direct handoff
of a process that just went through reschedule_idle and selected an idle cpu.
