The fundamental problem is not inefficiencies of SMP.  But rather
there are some tasks that simply do not parallelize well.  Big
supercomputer kinds of applications that require a lot of number
crunching usually benefit from multiple cpus.  But small every day
applications don't.  The only applications that scale perfectly with
the number of cpus are the embarrassingly parallel ones, in which no
communication is involved between the various subtasks.
This is not to say an elegant design might not get there, AMD is
trying for that.  But simple brute force will certainly not get you
there.
