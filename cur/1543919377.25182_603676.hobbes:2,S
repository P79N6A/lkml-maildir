I have written a sparse program to detect all callers that don't use
single-line literal strings for the printk format (posted to sparse
mailing list yesterday). So in fact, what I was doing was just that,
hunting them down and cleaning it up.
It so happens that my other patch also introduce a buffered printk
that supports atomic line continuations and multiple uninterrupted
lines, though this requires of course that the callers use these
functions. Other benefits include writing directly to the ring-buffer,
saving a 1K temporary buffer. The printk patch(es) can be viewed at
