Christ, these academics! They take real world problems that engineers
actually *solve* every day and then "prove" they're impossible.
Actually, it's trivial to solve this. Just wait. If the thread terminates,
it wasn't in an infinite loop.
If you've got the budget, I believe SGI has a machine that can do an
infinite loop in less than five seconds. That will save a lot of waiting.
