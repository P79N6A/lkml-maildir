Subject: [OFFTOPIC] Which NIC do the experts recommend?

We've got a box set up as a firewall gateway to the net which is
directly on an ethernet segment, and we're supposedly having
trouble with the Realtek 8029 NIC's we're using.  It has been
suggested by a few that this is the problem anyways.
As such, I'd like to know what is the most recommended NIC for a
Linux system.  We're looking for something that is both stable
(hardware) and to which the Linux drivers are known to be rock
solid.  Price is important too, and performance is not much of an
issue.  I was considering the 3c590 or something like that, but I
want some feedback first.
Please respond off the list privately only.
Thanks in advance.
