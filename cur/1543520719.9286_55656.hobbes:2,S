Hi,
I've just been going through the kernel_thread function in kernel 2.2.5.
Is there any restriction as to when this function is called? I tried to
create a kernel thread in one of the TCP input functions(i.e. when it
receives a packet) and it always gives me a kernel panic. Could someone
tell me when exactly a kernel thread is created. I think I am trying to
call it in an intr handler. Is this the problem?
My actual requirement is to create a kernel thread in the TCP/IP module
which will be in a continuous while loop polling for a certain condition.
Any links in this regard will be great.
TIA 
bye
vinu
