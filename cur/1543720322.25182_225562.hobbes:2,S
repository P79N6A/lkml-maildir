Feh. So swap the assignments.

I don't really care about the particular format exported to userspace,
but cpus_addr() is not a legitimate API. cpus_copy_to_user() is, but it
should belong to the core. Just shove the stuff that's doing cpus_addr()
for internals of cpumask_t into lib/bitmap.c etc. and it should be fine.
