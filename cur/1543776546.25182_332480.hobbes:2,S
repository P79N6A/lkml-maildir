I've found the no_overlay parameter to be promising, but it seems to be 
unused by the driver:
$ grep -r no_overlay drivers/*
drivers/media/video/bttv-cards.c:static unsigned int no_overlay=-1;
drivers/media/video/bttv-cards.c:module_param(no_overlay, int, 0444);
drivers/media/video/bttv-cards.c:               if (UNSET == no_overlay) {
drivers/media/video/bttv-cards.c:                       no_overlay = 1;
$
It seems some patch has removed that feature, and I have no grepable pile 
of patches here nor an idea (except for google) where I can get one.
