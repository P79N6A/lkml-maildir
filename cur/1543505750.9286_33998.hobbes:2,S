    eata_dma is broken
    aha152x is broken
(and both are now fixed). Aha152x at least is a bug introduced when the driver
was overhauled to fix the errors introduced in the "quick fix" phase during
2.1.x. Unfortunately aha152x has no maintainer and Adaptec don't seem to want
to be helpful on getting more copies of the docs out.
