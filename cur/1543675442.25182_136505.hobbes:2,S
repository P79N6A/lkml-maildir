The OSDL has a serious amount of automated testing we could point the
results of to a separate list if it is created.
Right now we avoid pointing that sort of thing to l-k because it would
drive people nuts.  On average we complete 40+ tests a day.
With all the testing efforts going on, a central list to post and
analyze results would be good.  People interested in helping out could
easily work with testers to look for trends and help with root cause
analysis.
When results are found to contain significant data, we can always notify l-k.
