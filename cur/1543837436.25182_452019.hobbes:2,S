I had a long discussion with Paul McKenney about this. I opposed the patch 
from a latency point of view: Suddenly a high-priority RT task could be 
made into releasing a task_struct. It would be better for latencies to 
defer it to a low priority task.
The conclusion we ended up with was that it is not a job for the RCU 
system, but it ought to be deferred to some other low priority task to 
free the task_struct.
