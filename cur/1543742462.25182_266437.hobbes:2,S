I don't think that a length filed is sufficient. The above example would 
print out on a standard terminal as 'My real license'. To prevent 
license string abuse a quite short (less than 80 characters) length 
limit and restriction to simple printable (i.e. 0x20-0x7e ASCII) 
characters is required.
I would prefer that modules not obeying these restrictions can't be 
loaded into the kernel.
