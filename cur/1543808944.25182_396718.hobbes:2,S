vmware uses mmap a lot.  Perhaps it's doing regular msyncs as well.

It shouldn't.  Did you really leave it for long enough?
If you did, then why does it happen there and not here?

The number of pages which are marked dirty, roughly.
In this case, all those pages' buffers had been written out by kjournald
behind the VM's back, so when the VM tried to write these "dirty" pages it
found that no I/O needed to be performed.
It would be nice if ext3 could clean the parent pages as it goes, but I
seem to recall deciding that this is not trivial.  I guess we could get a
99.9% solution by trylocking the page.
