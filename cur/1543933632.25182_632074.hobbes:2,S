Or, reset to pristine prior to testing, though that's more lines to
accomplish the same thing.  Either way, or some other way...
If check_tsc_warp() is called after initial boot, and the TSC has in the
meantime been set (BIOS, user, silicon, elves) to a value lower than the
last stored/stale value, we blame the TSC.  Reset to pristine condition
after every test.
