A similar issue here that has cropped up with a few laptops I've
tried: The measured BogoMIPS and CPU clock speed varies from boot to
boot.
The machines are all Compaq Armada M700's, all models are PIII-500,
PIII-600, PIII-650, PIII-700 and PIII-750's.  Any one of these models
will be randomly detected as having any speed that is either a)
correct or b) of any model below it.
It has always been tried on a kernel with APM, 2.2.14-17. If anyone
wants more info, feel free to ask for moer info.
cheers,
Alexander
