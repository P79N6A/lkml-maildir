I agree it isn't intuitive, and if nfsroot=xxx is specified it should
probably turn on if there is missing information.
But if you have to select the command line anyway....
Mostly I like the situation where I can compile it in and turn it on
when I need it, instead of having to do thing differently if it is
compiled in or not.
ip=on is all it really takes.

Mostly, but not exclusively.

First the booting situation on linux with respect to multiple platform
sucks.  We pass parameters in weird ways on every platform.  The command
line is the only thing that stays mostly the same.  I'm looking at what
it takes to clean that up, so we can have multiplatform bootloaders.
I have implemented what it takes to attach a ramdisk, and if you can
boot an arbitrary kernel it isn't hard to have a program that attaches
a ramdisk.  
Now although I believe this is the right direction to go, you will
notice I ported the dhcp IP auto configuration from 2.2.19 to to 2.4.x
Buying a little more time to get this working.
