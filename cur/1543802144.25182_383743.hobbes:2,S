Yes.
I'll happily admit I definetely made just that mistake.
Before I bought the new card, I did some quick asking around, and heard that
M-Audio was supposedly good. I just wanted better sound quality than the
integrated I815 sound (shouldn't be much to ask), and preferably HW mixing.
I checked that revo7.1 was supported, but when I went to the reseller, they
were out of stock for that one. So I made a quick and unconsidered decision
to buy revo5.1 instead.
So it was definetely bad research on my part. 
But I still maintain that the asoundrc required for swmixing is not as
trivial as "just works". It wasn't even with i815 audio.
