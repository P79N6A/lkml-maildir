Subject: [PATCH] Vmscan.c: Account for memory already freed in seeking to free more.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/12/70

The current versions of shrink_all_zones and shrink_all_memory don't
take account of memory already freed when making multiple calls to seek
to free memory. As a result, we can end up freeing far more memory than
was asked for. This can in turn result in more (unnecessary) paging
if/when the data is later needed.
These modifications seek to alleviate this situation by modifying
swap_cluster_max by the number of pages freed by shrink_inactive_list in
shrink_all_zones before proceeding to the next zone, and in
shrink_all_memory before shrinking slab and going to the next priority.
