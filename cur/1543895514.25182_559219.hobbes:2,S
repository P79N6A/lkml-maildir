THe Signed-off-by: document the path a given patch have taken on its way
to the final acceptance and does not have any significance whatsoever
about the content of the patch. Anyone on the Signed-of-by route
may change the patch (and I often do so) without further notice.
So judging if a Signed-off-by: should be added or not based on
patch content is wrong. It is a patch anyway.
That said the legal(in a loose definition of legal) rationale may
be of much less significance when trivially removing some code.
But we use the same mechanish even to cover spelling corrections.
