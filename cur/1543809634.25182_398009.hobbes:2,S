Doesn't your patch 1/2 that expanded the scope of siglock in
copy_process() prevent this from happening?
o	A new process is being created on CPU 0, and does the first
	attach_pid() in copy_process(), but has not yet done
	the second attach_pid().
o	Meanwhile, on CPU 1, kill_proc_info() successfully looks up the
	new process via find_task_by_pid().
o	Also on CPU 1, kill_proc_info() calls group_send_sig_info(),
	which checks permissions, locates the sighand structure,
	then attempts to acquire siglock.
	Given your patch 1/2, CPU 1 cannot proceed until CPU 0 gets
	done with the remaining attach_pid() calls.
So, what am I missing this time?  ;-)
