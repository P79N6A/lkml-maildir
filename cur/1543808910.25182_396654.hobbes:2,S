What does it do "wrong" anyway? IIRC, DMA in general works...
Also note that since SCSI does not support DMA, I wouldn't consider lack of 
DMA for ide-scsi a bug. Just because the underlying device is IDE and has DMA 
support doesn't mean that the SCSI layer (which has no reason for DMA) should 
use it.
