Where do you expect to load the kernel from? And what CPU/Board? 
The basic process is to POST the board, load the kernel into SDRAM,
and run the kernel. Where you want to load the kernel from determines
the other initialization work you need to do. 
Alternately, have you looked at PMON? It may provide everything you
need for a MIPS-based system.
