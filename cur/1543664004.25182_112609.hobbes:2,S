Hi,
we have modified the linux driver for SL811 USB HOST Controller by CYPRESS.
We have improved the program's flow:
- interrupt handler,
- double buffering.
It works well during writing transactions, but we still have problems
implementing
double buffering during reading transactions.
We would like to send you our source code to attend the next kernel release.
These codes work on uClinux (kernel 2.4) too.
How do we have to send these codes?
Thanks.
       Linux Nergal Group.
