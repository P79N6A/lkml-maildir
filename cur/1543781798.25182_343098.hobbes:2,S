Maybe the card is pretty close to going to crash, but... two disk
successive disk errors still should not be cause for journal
corruption.
[Also errors could be corelated. Imagine severe overheat. You'll
successive failing writes, but if you let cool it down, you'll still
have working media... only with corrupt journal :-)]
