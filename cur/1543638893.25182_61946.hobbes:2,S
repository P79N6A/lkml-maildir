I don't think so. The queue lock is synchronizing them.
And then we usually add them just to the front of the queue in question
and wait for finishment until the request is done.
After all ide_raw_taskfile only gets used for REQ_SPECIAL request
types. This does *not* contain normal data request from block IO.
As of master slave issues - well we have the data pre allocated per
device not per channel! If q->request_fn would properly return the
error count instead of void, we could even get rid ot the
checking for rq->errors after finishment... But well that's
entierly different story.
