Of course ordering rules must be obeyed, and side effects cannot be moved
across sequence points. Thus if the two volatile loads are in separate
instructions, as in:
	int x1, x2;
	volatile unsigned char x1, x2;
	x1 = v1;
	x2 = v2;
Then you're NOT allowed to combined them. However if there is no sequence
points between them the compiler is free to do it (although I'm not sure it
will...) as in e.g.:
	x1 = v1 << 8 + v2;
Note that this is not too much of a problem for system programming, as you
have a way to be sure they are not combined: just use intermediate variables
and set them separately; the nice thing there is that as you use these
intermediate variables just once, the compiler will eliminate them. But be
careful: the sequence point MUST BE RETAINED, and then the two loads cannot
be combined (in case 1 of course).
