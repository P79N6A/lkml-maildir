Pointers on IA32 are still 32 bits, so (as I understand it) each
process can address a maximum of 4GB.  You would have to allocate
multiple chunks (in shared memory or mmap()ed files, so they're
persistent) and map them in and out as needed (which could get hairy).

Best bet is probably to buy an Alpha machine, if you don't want to
spend time working around the 4GB limitation.
