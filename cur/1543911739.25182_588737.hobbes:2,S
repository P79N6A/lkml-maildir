I has applied the new patch, and start test program last Friday.
So far, the test program has run for three days.
In my test program, all threads is created in one process, so they
are in the same thread group. If two thread is not in the same thread
group, they have the different ->sighand->siglock. In this case, the
lock can't prevent the sigqueue object from race condition.
