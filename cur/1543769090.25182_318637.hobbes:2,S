Hello,
i have a question about this little code snippet, found in
sys_semtimedop() (ipc/sem.c):
        for (sop = sops; sop < sops + nsops; sop++) {
                if (sop->sem_num >= max)
                        max = sop->sem_num;
                if (sop->sem_flg & SEM_UNDO)
                        undos++;
                if (sop->sem_op < 0)
                        decrease = 1;
                if (sop->sem_op > 0)
                        alter = 1;
        }
        alter |= decrease;
The variable decrease will never be used again in this 
function, so why this intricate code? Isn't this much easier and works
also:
        for (sop = sops; sop < sops + nsops; sop++) {
                if (sop->sem_num >= max)
                        max = sop->sem_num;
                if (sop->sem_flg & SEM_UNDO)
                        undos++;
                if (sop->sem_op != 0)
                        alter = 1;
        }
Maybe i'm totally wrong, so please correct me and don't shoot me up,
'cause i'm not a os developer.
Thanks,
  Patrick
