You make it sound like users should feel sorry for wanting features 
already commonly available on other high performance unix kernels.
The answer is quite simple, people who are consolidating systems and 
working with fewer, larger systems, want to mark processes, groups of 
processes or entire containers into CPU scheduling classes, then either 
fair balance between them, limit them or reserve them a portion of the 
CPU - depending on the user and what their requirements are. What is 
unclear about that?
Yes, this does get somewhat simpler if you strap yourself into a 
complete virtualisation straightjacket, but the current thread is not 
about that approach - and the continual suggestions that we are all just 
being stupid and going about it the wrong way are locally off-topic.
Bear in mind that we have on the table at least one group of scheduling 
solutions (timeslice scaling based ones, such as the VServer one) which 
is virtually no overhead and could potentially provide the "jumpers" 
necessary for implementing more complex scheduling policies.
