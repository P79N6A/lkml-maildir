This seems to me the preferable way.  We create a full virtual net
device for each new container, and fully virtualize the device
namespace.

The last one in your diagram confuses me - why foo0:1?  I would
have thought it'd be
host                  |  guest 0  |  guest 1  |  guest2
----------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------
  |                   |           |           |
  |-> l0      <-------+-> lo0 ... | lo0       | lo0
  |                   |           |           |
  |-> eth0            |           |           |
  |                   |           |           |
  |-> veth0  <--------+-> eth0    |           |
  |                   |           |           |
  |-> veth1  <--------+-----------+-----------+-> eth0
  |                   |           |           |
  |-> veth2   <-------+-----------+-> eth0    |
I think we should avoid using device aliases, as trying to do
something like giving eth0:1 to guest1 and eth0:2 to guest2
while hiding eth0:1 from guest2 requires some uglier code (as
I recall) than working with full devices.  In other words,
if a namespace can see eth0, and eth0:2 exists, it should always
see eth0:2.
So conceptually using a full virtual net device per container
certainly seems cleaner to me, and it seems like it should be
simpler by way of statistics gathering etc, but are there actually
any real gains?  Or is the support for multiple IPs per device
actually enough?
Herbert, is this basically how ngnet is supposed to work?
