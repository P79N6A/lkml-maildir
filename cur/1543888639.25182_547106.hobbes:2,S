Yes, it is reliable if you turn on thermal polling.

Heh, you suggest this? It is even less functional than current
solution -- which works okay as long as you keep thermal polling
working.

You are misstating the situation. With thermal polling, it is pretty
much okay, and it is certainly better than "ride fans manually" hack
you suggested.

No. Manually turning off fans is even worse hack.
