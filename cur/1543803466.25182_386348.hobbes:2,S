Ok, got a question. How do deal with the false reporting and handling of
a lock circularity window involving the handoff of task A's BKL to another
task B ? Task A is blocked trying to get a mutex owned by task B, task A
is block B since it owns BKL which task B is contending on. It's not a
deadlock since it's a hand off situation.
I didn't see any handling of this case in the code and I was wondering
if the traversal logic you wrote avoids this case as an inherent property
and I missed that stuff ?
