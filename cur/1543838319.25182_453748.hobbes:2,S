It looks like a screw interaction between the latency tracer and the mutex
code that creates such a wacked out looking stack trace. Unfortunately,
I've been unsuccessful at reproducing it, so I'm going to focus on a partial
clean up so that the rtmutex is a bit more friendly to the latency tracer.
This is kind of a pain.
You have all sorts of strange things going on in that config like NUMA
emulation and stuff which I can't imagine why you'd have that on, 1000
a sec tick, etc... If you can do a bit of work and narrow which option
is it, then I might be able to reproduce the situation over here. I'm
bothered by that bug, but it's going to need to be attacked from a couple
angles, two of which I just mentioned. If I can get a bit of help from
you where I can isolate the subsystem, it would be helpful while I'll
examine the tracing here.
