2.6.21-rc6 is ok.
Here, I get messages from usbtouchscreen, something
rc5-mm4 failed to produce.
The egalax driver gets /class/input/input3,
usbcore registers usbtouchscreen, and the
touchscreen works. 
Well, it became /dev/input/event3 while
2.6.18 placed it at /dev/input/event1, but I think that
is more of a udev problem...
