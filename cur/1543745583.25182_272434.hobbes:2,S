Thanks to a helpful hint from Christoph earlier this week I put
together a patch that throws away over 900 lines from the ia64
irq.c
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-ia64&m=110072859114157&w=2
It's queued up in an internal tree waiting for 2.6.11 to open.
Some parts of your patch may still be needed.
