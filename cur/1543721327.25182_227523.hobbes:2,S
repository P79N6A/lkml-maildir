Please have a look at any package out there (or 99% of them) that need
to figure out where the kernel _source_ is ... they all use something
like:
KERNEL_SRC="/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build"
or
KERNEL_SRC="$(readlink /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build)"
If you now change it to /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/source, many will
break (depending if they might try things like looking if /usr/src/linux
is around), and all will have to add _another_ kludge to figure things
out.
Its a bad idea IMHO.
