  I know but there are filesystem limits which prevents us from using all 31-bits.
There is 2GB limit on 32-bit archs but it doesn't bother us as it will be hopefully
removed. But there is 16GB limit on ext2 using 1KB blocks if I summed it well...
And as we have 40-bytes long structures we need 128GB to be able to use all UIDs.
For this we need at least 4kb blocks which are not used very much... I think it is
good to think whether it wouldn't be good to switch to some other structure.
