Hmmm.... I hit the exact same BUG in dcache.h in a completely
different circumstance (during readlink("/proc/self/exe") in perl).
It was on ext3 in a recent -mm, but had no connection with nfs.
I'm wondering if something in recent dcache or ext3 patches have
caused us to end up with negative d_count on a dentry.  This could
cause the line 276 BUG_ON to happen at weird places.
Could you try changing that line from
		BUG_ON(!atomic_read(&dentry->d_count));
to
		BUG_ON(atomic_read(&dentry->d_count) <= 0);
and see if that make it fall over more quickly?
