Yes, so it's a must-fix before this gets anywhere near a real distribution.

The second half of that sentence is obsolete and should have been deleted.

No, these are all for read operations. (Actually, this is a bit of
documentation that's bit-rotted - there's no longer a per-task
"container" pointer). I'll update this.
For write operations, only the container system should be modifying
those pointers (under the protection of both container_mutex and
alloc_lock).

Yes, this is some incomplete behaviour that I inherited from cpusets.
Needs tidying up.

Yes, we could for the cost of an extra dereference. Not sure it's a
big deal either way.

Yes. It's to simplify the common case of reporting a number in a
control file. (Not yet well documented :-( )
