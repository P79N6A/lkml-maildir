The word "filesystem" confused me. In my experience > 2TB filesystems
tend to be the norm for NFS shared systems these days, and so the fact
that 'struct kstatfs' uses sector_t irks me.
Access to > TB files is not unheard of in HPC circles (particularly in
the case of simulations), but these files tend to be pretty sparse, so
the block counts are not necessarily that large.
My point stands, though. whether or not sector_t may indeed be the right
size as far as i_block is concerned, a quick grep through (fs|block)/*.c
shows you that as a type, it is anything but a count of the number of
blocks in a file.
If you really want a variable size type here, then the right thing to do
is to define a __kernel_blkcnt_t or some such thing, and hide the
configuration knob for it somewhere in the arch-specific Kconfigs.
Cheers,
