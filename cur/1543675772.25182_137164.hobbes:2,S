Not bad.  We can even do a little better.  Since only one workspace is
really absolutely necessary (ignoring the siftirq case), there is no
need to fail anymore.  If we don't get enough memory for all
workspaces, initialize the semaphore to be a little lower and live
with fewer workspaces.
I like your ideas, really! :)

...that is not trivial to get rid of.  Image the case where two
processes are writing to two devices.  With two buffers, we do rmew
whenever switching blocks for one device.  With one buffer, we have to
do it for every context switch between those two processes, which will
wear down the flash a lot faster.
Considering that mtdblock should not be performance critical in
production use anyway, this is a very hard problem.  What do you
think?
