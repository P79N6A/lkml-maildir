We would need a platform-specific function to tell us how long until
the next jiffy to do any better, I think, and even then it would only
make much of a difference if HZ was significantly smaller than 1000.
We could do the how-long-until-next-jiffy function quite easily and
quickly on ppc and ppc64, just by reading the decrementer register and
scaling it.  I don't know about other architectures.  But if we are
mostly using HZ=1000 there doesn't seem to be much point.
Paul.
