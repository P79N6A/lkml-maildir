Sorry, I know that following up ones own postings is bad style, but I just
discovered something that might help solving the problem.
When I partition the media (which I tried to avoid doing till now) with one
primary partition, and THEN mke2fs -b 2048 -m0 -c /dev/sdb1 it, mke2fs tells
me that 
	Checking for bad blocks (read-only test): done
	Block 0 in primary superblock/group descriptor area bad.
	Blocks 0 through 2 must be good in order to build a filesystem.
	Aborting....
OK, I fdisk the medium to use blocks 4..606 for partition 1. Perfect. No
errors without -c. With -c, it complains about block 0 being bad. (How can I
still use the medium?) 
When I start cp -a ~ /mod, there is an occasional SCSI bus reset that looks
like this:

during which even the mouse cursor stops.
I cannot trust my MOD media under these circumstances. Is there any way to
resolve this and make them reliable?
