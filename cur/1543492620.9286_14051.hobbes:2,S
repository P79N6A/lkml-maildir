Hello,
I am afraid to be a little boring with my NFS problems :-(
I already mentionned that ypserv + rpc.kmountd were looping upon
mount request. I have removed the binding on the local ypserver,
so that that ypserver is no longer involved in the problem.
The rpc.kmountd (knfs 1.2) does sometimes not answer to the request.
Sometimes it does, sometimes it does not.
At the time it does not, a strace shows that it is constantly performing
the following systeme calls every 11000 (or so) microseconds (difference
between two gettimeofday calls) :
> open("/etc/hosts", O_RDONLY)            = 8
> fcntl(8, F_GETFD)                       = 0
> fcntl(8, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)           = 0
> fstat(8, {st_mode=0, st_size=0, ...})   = 0
> mmap(0, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x4000c000
> read(8, "127.0.0.1               localhos"..., 4096) = 100
> read(8, "", 4096)                       = 0
> close(8)                                = 0
> munmap(0x4000c000, 4096)                = 0
> open("/var/yp/binding/spmo.sagem.fr.2", O_RDONLY) = 8
> readv(8, [{")\3", 2}, {"\1\0\0\0\206\n,b\2\221\0\0", 12}], 2) = 14
> close(8)                                = 0
> gettimeofday({923674759, 807244}, NULL) = 0
> getpid()                                = 325
> socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP) = 8
> bind(8, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(867), sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = 0
> ioctl(8, FIONBIO, [1])                  = 0
> fcntl(8, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)           = 0
> sendto(8, "8\2x\216\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\2\0\1\206"..., 104, 0, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(657), sin_addr=inet_addr("134.10.44.98")}, 16) = 104
> select(1024, [8], NULL, NULL, {5, 0})   = 1 (in [8], left {5, 0})
> recvfrom(8, "8\2x\216\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 8800, 0, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(657), sin_addr=inet_addr("134.10.44.98")}, [16]) = 72
> close(8)                                = 0
$ cat /proc/version 
Linux version 2.2.5-ac4 (danis@dgps6) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #1 ven avr 9 12:47:33 MEST 1999
The /etc/exports file looks like :
/u0     @urd(rw)
/u1     @urd(rw)
The 'urd' map is quite a large map.
So, the fact is that we can not use the knfsd as NFS server by now.
I do not want to switch back to the unfsd, because of the performance
loss it would be.
A+
