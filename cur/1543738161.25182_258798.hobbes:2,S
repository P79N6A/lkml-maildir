Obviously, what would happen here is a release of 2.4 or 2.6 that is 
stable would be snapshoted
and used. And yes, you are correct, bug fixes would not be allowed 
unless they were applied
independently and without access to GPL code. However, this would allow 
OSDL and kernel.org
to become self-sustaining and would not impact the GPL process -- just 
let you guys peel
off releases and pocket some $$$ on the side. A lot of big companies 
would line up to pay you.
So, who do I write the check to?
Jeff
