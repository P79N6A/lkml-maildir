They are not separate. It just that when using close you decrement the 
"reference" count to the "real" fd struct (like done on FS inodes). When 
reaches 0 its closed. So still as I said, fds are shared ;)
I havent check kernel sources, I just say that the fact the you can and 
need to close() a shared fd on each sharing process doesnt mean the 
sockets are independent.
