Hello!
This patch confuses checkpatch.pl from Linux 2.6.29-rc1:
====================
--- foo.h.old	2009-01-13 16:48:22.000000000 -0500
+++ foo.h	2009-01-13 16:48:18.000000000 -0500
@@ -3,4 +3,8 @@
 
 
 
+#ifdef FOOBAR
+#define foo
+#endif
+
 #endif /* FOO_H */
====================
$ scripts/checkpatch.pl foo.diff 
Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at
scripts/checkpatch.pl line 453.
Apparently, the last #endif causes some data to be popped from the stack
for preprocessor directives.  However, the corresponding #ifdef is
outside the patch, so this fails.
