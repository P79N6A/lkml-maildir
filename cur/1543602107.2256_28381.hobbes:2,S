This case is different. Intel promised the update "soon". For them it's
simple, either they update or they can't say their 440GX boards are linux
compatible, because with the current bios they really aren't. 
They could also chose to open the "Intel Proprietary" information that is
needed to actually work with this board properly instead of via bios hacks,
but that's their choice...
