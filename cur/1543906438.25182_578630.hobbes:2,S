I second this. For anything visible in userspace from
include/* we require usage of the kernel specific
__u8, __u16, __u32, __u64 typedefs but for device_id we accept
kernel_ulong_t which result in the following crap in
file2alias.c:
/* We use the ELF typedefs for kernel_ulong_t but bite the bullet and
 * use either stdint.h or inttypes.h for the rest. */
#if KERNEL_ELFCLASS == ELFCLASS32
typedef Elf32_Addr      kernel_ulong_t;
#define BITS_PER_LONG 32
#else
typedef Elf64_Addr      kernel_ulong_t;
#define BITS_PER_LONG 64
#endif
And we ought to have __u64 available.
See for example types.h from asm-i386:
#if defined(__GNUC__) && !defined(__STRICT_ANSI__)
typedef __signed__ long long __s64;
typedef unsigned long long __u64;
#endif
