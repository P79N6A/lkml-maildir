Well, the FAQ is supposed to answer these questions. There's a whole
section on compile problems. Do we need another FAQ?
However, I could easily upload the FAQ to kernel.org at the same time
as I upload to tux.org, since I've already got an area there. Would
this be useful? If so, then perhaps Linus could put in a symbolic link
so that ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/faq.html points to:
"people/rgooch/faq.html", so that it's visible from the top level.
