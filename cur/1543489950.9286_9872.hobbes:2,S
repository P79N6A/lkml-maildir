I know it does have a record-oriented structure. I just say I do not like
it. Tapes have that structure too but I can tolerate it because they have
to (for hardware performance reasons). /proc/<pid>/maps does not have to
be the way it is.
But I stop here, for anything more I could say would be a waste of time,
until I actually suggest some replacement for read_maps().

Tigran.
