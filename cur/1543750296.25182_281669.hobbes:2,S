Actually I did test the build (and Tom Duffy at Sun has actually run
the drivers on his system), but I forgot to include the required Kconfig
change -- I just have it in my local test tree.

I think sparc64 is the only such platform where InfiniBand is likely
to be of much interest.  However I'll check out all of arch/ and send
patches to hook up drivers/infiniband/ to the relevant maintainers
once IB makes it upstream.
Thanks,
