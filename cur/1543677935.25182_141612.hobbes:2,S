Honestly, I'm not sure.  My original patch was against 2.5.69, which
didn't have this section of code at all, I think there have been some
patches to the code between 2.5.69 and 2.5.72 which have mucked around
with stuff.
It looked suspicious to me as well, and I'd be happy to remove this
from my patch, since I don't know what locking is needed around this
section of code off hand.  Let me look at some other drivers and see
how they unregister themselves.  Maybe theres a tty_drive_spinlock
somewhere that should be used instead.
Thanks for your comments, good to see you back on l-k.
John
