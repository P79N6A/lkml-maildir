I regularly put files on zipdisks for various people, and get files
back from them the same way, so it does happen. I've no idea what the
hardware is at their end, but a 100M zipdisk is a far better way of
sending some data to somebody for them to comment on, possibly
updating it and returning the updated version to me, than a pile of
1.4M floppies would ever be...
Best wishes from Riley.
