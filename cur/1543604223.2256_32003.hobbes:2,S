I have a K6-2 too.  When I'm using 100% of the CPU, the temp of
the CPU is around 42 - 44 °C.  When I don't use any CPU at all it
will lower with about 10 °C.
>From my .config:
CONFIG_PM=y
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
CONFIG_APM=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
# CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE is not set
# CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE is not set
# CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK is not set
# CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT is not set
# CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS is not set
# CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF is not set
The only reason I enable APM is because then I can do a
powerdown.
I'm willing to test if the temp goes up when I enable
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE, and it's idle otherwise.
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE is shown as "Make CPU Idle calls when idle",
I don't see a "Send Halt command on idle".
