I'm having some strange problems with nfs and 2.2.0.  Here's
the situation:
I have an nfs server, it's actually running 2.2.0-pre5.  Reason
that machine isn't up to date with 2.2.0 is raid dependencies.
Patches for the latest raid aren't available for 2.2.0 last time
I checked.  I suspect this could be the problem with nfs overall,
but from the change descriptions on linuxhq.com, it looked as if
nfs didn't have any major changes from pre5.
Problem:
I have home:/usr/webservers mounted on web6:/usr/webservers.
I'm using frontpage server extension on the web server, web6,
which is in /usr/local/frontpage on the local filesystem.  When
using the frontpage server admin, it errors saying it is unable
to open /use/webserver/https-web6/conf/httpd.conf, which is on
the nfs volume.
If I copy that particular file to the local file system, it works
fine.  Also, when I do use that method, it then fails writing to
the user's home directory, which is also on an nfs volume.
I'm not sure if there's options to nfs or whatnot that I'm missing,
but this definitely was a 2.2.0 occurrence since I've been using
this same scheme on 2.0.x for quite some time now.
Also, which nfs implementation should I be using.  I've seen three
now.  knfsd from yggdrassil(sp), linux-nfs, and the usual nfs-server.
Right now I'm just using the regular nfs-server 2.2beta40.  As
I understand, this is still user space nfs, and isn't have fast
as knfsd, kernel space nfs.
thanks for help, suggestions, etc.
If you need additional info, please ask.  Also if possible, cc
my address on replies.  I'm not on the linux-kernel list.
