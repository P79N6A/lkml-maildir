Gah! I feel silly now. I had that when using modules so that things
would stop complaining about not having audio when I didn't want it on
(it usually brings down my laptop in a heap - instant off). Am trying
now with the new ALSA drivers and 2.5.x to see if they do thesame or
not. So far so good (ie no shutdowns). :)
BTW. Should having the Mic volume way-up result in a highly piched tone
being emitted from the speakers? I don't remember this ever being the
case before. (had this happen this morning when I turned the laptop on -
nice way to -really- wake up)
