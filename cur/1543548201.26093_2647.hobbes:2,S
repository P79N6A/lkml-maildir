Every line of code I wrote is under the GPLv2 or later (except those bits
I contributed that were BSD non advertising derived and which I left the BSD
license on).

I think an appropriate concern. The future GPL is constrained by the GPLv2
clause 9 to be 'similar in spirit...'. You also dont ever have to take any
code that specifies GPLv3 or later.
