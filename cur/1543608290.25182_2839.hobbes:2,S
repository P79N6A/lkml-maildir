Subject: Forcing 8259A for one irq.

I've got a strange scenario whereupon i have a box with IO-APIC enabled
(SMP box) and a driver which seems not to be SMP safe and only works if i
boot the kernel with noapic. My question is, which is the cleanest way of
making a specific IRQ use the 8259 instead of IOAPIC? (kind of like the
timer on some boxes).
I've looked at the enable_8259A_irq function, but my method looks terribly
incorrect (and untested too). Would this method work? And is there
anything i should look out for?
irq_num = IRQ below 15 (specified as parameter to module)
add entry to IO-APIC routing table? (local-apic to CPU#0)
enable_8259A_irq(irq_num)
This is only a temporary measure until i get the driver completely SMP
safe and i want to avoid running noapic.
Thanks in advance,
