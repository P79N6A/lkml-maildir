Patch looks pretty good.  It is _very_ difficult to pick through, and 
pick apart, though.
Consider that one or more people reading your email (a) would want some 
of these fixes but (b) already have some of these fixes.
This is why we _really_ need you to split up your patches.  Multiple 
split-up patches, one per email, is preferred.  Don't worry about 
sending us too much email:  we like it like that.
As an aside, I know at least part of the VIA irq routing stuff still 
needs fixing.  For some on-board VIA southbridge devices, irq routing is 
accomplished by writing the PCI_INTERRUPT_xxx values to PCI config 
registers of the target device; for others, the normal pirq PCI config 
registers on the southbridge are used.  Alan's new irq stuff in 2.4.x 
IMO should be merged into 2.6.x soonish, as Alan's work makes a big step 
towards making it possible to fix some of the harder-to-fix irq routing 
problems.
