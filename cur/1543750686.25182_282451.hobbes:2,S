I am trying to write a backup CD. The first write goes fine, I have rw 
permission on the device, I use /dev/hdc, all is fine. I can mount the 
CD, read it, etc.
However - it was written with the -multi option so I can add things to 
it, since most of my backups are 50MB at a time. When I try to get the 
size (using a perl script) which does:
  cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc -msinfo
I get permission denied. Even if I set cdrecord setuid (as a test, I 
don't run that way).
Back to ide-scsi, the perl program allows me to have the best features 
of growisofs and some other usefulk features for backing up relatively 
small datasets on a single CD.
Just a FYI - I assume there's a good reason why reading the unclosed 
filesystem size would compromise security.
