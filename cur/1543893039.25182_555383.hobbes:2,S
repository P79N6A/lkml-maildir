That is a misleading claim. While being dual-licensed would make it either
for other projects to adopt Linux code, it would have three downsides:
1) If Linux code were adopted into other projects that were not
dual-licensed, changes could not be imported back into Linux unless the
changes were dual-licensed which is not likely when the contributions are
made to a project that's not dual-licensed.
2) Linux could no longer take code from other projects that are GPL v2
licensed unless it could obtain them under a dual license.
And, last and probably most serious:
3) Linux derivatives could be available with just a GPL v3 license and no
GPL v2. license if the derivers wanted things that way.
