So pci_cache_line_size = max (all L1 cacheline sizes in the system)
with some possible fudging (that i486 issue, etc).  But your patch
would seem to handle most archs correctly already.

I just happened to notice _this specific case_ which as I mentioned
sure doesn't feel like a hardware bug to me!  The specific device
was a Philips ISP 1561 USB 2.0 controller (two OHCI one EHCI), and
the two more troublesome (less forgiving) devices were from VIA.
So that machine had quite a few high speed USB controllers (including
a NetChip 2280 :) running Linux, all using MWI and no particular
problems being visible ... and no messages about broken BIOS setup.

Sounds good to me then.
