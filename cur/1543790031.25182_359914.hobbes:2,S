  A bugfix release 0.11 is available.  A buffer overflow bug in 
log_message() is fixed.  What can be overwritten by overflowing the 
buffer is only "\n\0", so it shouldn't be very dangerous.  Still, it's a 
buffer overflow which can be triggered by incoming messages.  Please 
update.  Sorry for the hassle.
