FWIW, in FreeBSD, MADV_DONTNEED is not destructive, and just makes pages 
(including anonymous ones) more likely to get swapped out.

This would seem like the best way to go, since it would bring Linux's 
behavior more in line with what other systems do.

FreeBSD's MADV_FREE only works on anonymous memory (it's a noop for 
vnode-backed memory), and marks the pages clean before moving them to 
the inactive queue, so that they can be freed or reused quickly, without 
causing a pagefault.
