I have got similar problems with quake3 and rtcw und 2.6.0-test6, I'm 
able to start quake3 once and exit with out any problems, but starting 
it a second time it just hangs with a black screen. I'm able to switch 
to console and kill it (it's using 100% cpu, but ~45% is actually used 
by the kernel), but my mouse won't move until I restart X.
But I think the new nvidia driver (4496) causes this, since I see 
exactly the same behavior under 2.4.22. Also the graphics in quake3 are 
are very weird and ut2003 and tenebrae (a modified quake1) won't even 
start. (complaining about missing OpenGL functions as far as I can 
tell)
If anyone is interested anyway, I atached the strace of the first and 
second quake3 run.
