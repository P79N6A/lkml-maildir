it's the same with top, isn't it? but this is still a helpful tool.
you have a snapshot and can compare the values you got with others like
this cpu's usage at that time etc.
and you even can see your application "movin' arund" on the cpu's.
but ne question: in design, where every cpu has it's own cash,
does it make sense to put a process on a different cpu each second ???
