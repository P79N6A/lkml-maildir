  The final report is for this ranking but the locking chain (if I understand it
right) is:
tty_mutex (con_close) -> i_mutex (sysfs: remove_subdir)
i_mutex (do_truncate) -> i_alloc_sem (notify_change) -> truncate_mutex (ext3_truncate)
truncate_mutex (ext3_get_blocks_handle) -> dqptr_sem (dquot_alloc_space)
So it complains about tty_mutex vs dqptr_sem (I don't know why it does not
complain about tty_mutex vs i_mutex) but the wrong link in the chain is
that i_mutex from remove_subdir() [sysfs] and i_mutex from do_truncate()
[ext3] are different and should never depend on each other...
