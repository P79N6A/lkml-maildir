Netpoll UDP input handler needs to pull up the UDP headers
and handle receive checksum offloading properly just like
the normal UDP input path does else we get corrupted
checksums.
[NET]: Fix UDP checksum issue in net poll mode.
In net poll mode, the current checksum function doesn't consider the
kind of packet which is padded to reach a specific minimum length. I
believe that's the problem causing my test case failed. The following
patch fixed this issue.
