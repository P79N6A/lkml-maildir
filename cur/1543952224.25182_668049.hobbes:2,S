Subject: [PATCH] x86: K8, GEODE_LX, CRUSOE, EFFICEON and CORE2 support the cmovxx instructions.

x86: K8, GEODE_LX, CRUSOE, EFFICEON and CORE2 support CMOV.
Instead of summing up the cpu's that have support for the
cmov instruction, sum up the cpu's that don't.
GEODE_LX has no entry in arch/x86/Makefile_32.cpu, so it
did not get any -march or -mtune arguments at all. I quite
arbitrarily added -march=i686 -mtune=pentium-mmx. This way
gcc is allowed to use cmov instructions.

Thanks for letting me know.
I chose i686 with pentium-mmx scheduling. This enables cmov, while
the scheduling is still pentium-like. If i586 is really better,
GEODE_LX should be listed as not using cmov at all (because the
compiler does not generate them).
Loop/jump/function alignment is automatically turned off if you
compile the kernel with CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y so I think
it should not be set explicitly.
Qemu does not run GEODE_LX-kernels (no 3dNow).
Greetings,
