Actually it's true :)

Well, yeah :)
You'll have to document this loud and clear: anyone who closes, dup2s
over or passed an epoll-activated file descriptor _must_ use
EPOLL_CTL_DEL first, otherwise heisenbugs may eventually follow.

Unfortunately I just thought of a real problem :(
What happens when process A sends (or forks) a dup of its fd 3 to
process B which also has it as fd 3, and both processes use epoll on
it?  (This is a fairly common scenario, to have one process/thread
reading and the other writing a tty or socket).  The two processes
will clash because they have the same (file *, fd) pair, yet there is
no way for them to know they are clashing.
With current epoll code this is a problem already, because keying on
(file *) alone is not enough.  Unfortunately (file *,fd) key doesn't
fix this one.
