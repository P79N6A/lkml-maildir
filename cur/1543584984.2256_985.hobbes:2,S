Instead of putting arch-specific ifdefs in drivers, would it be
reasonable to add a per-arch flag UNALIGNED_PROFITABLE?  Arch-specific
ifdefs all over the default rx_copybreak values in net drivers are the
example I have in mind, but it seems like it would be good knowledge
that can be easily exposed to the rest of the kernel.
