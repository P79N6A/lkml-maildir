Yes, I know about this area, as I wrote (Documentation/i386/zero-page.txt). 
And I even know how to pass parameter from zero-page into kernel space 
(setup.c). But I need to use this parm, I fetched, in both setup.S and misc.c 
(see below). And I don't have any ideas about execute order of setup.S, 
misc.c and setup.c.
Best regards,
Andrew.
