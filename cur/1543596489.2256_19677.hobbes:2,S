There's a bug in i91uscsi.c, init_tulip where it cycles through the onboard NVRAM 
config. On the controller there's a single byte per device but it cycles through the 
NVRAM in words. Since x86 words are two bytes a piece this means that the 
code uses the NVRAM config for the device on twice the SCSI id - the only one 
that's right is the one on id 0.
The patch below has been working here since January - though I've just extracted 
this one fix from a much larger modification that I've done to the driver - proc fs
support, merging of i91uscsi.h and ini9100u.h since they contain many of the
same definitions but the two definitions are different which looks extremely
dangerous to me! i91uscsi.h is no more here. 
I may have missed something with this one fix.
