Oops, bounced the cc to linux-kernel.  Sorry about the 2 copies,

Oops, mailing list temporal skew.  Please ignore my comment about
sysconf(), I see that glibc doesn't make good use of it.  And the
methodology of sysconf() is somewhat flawed in this case, as it's designed
in terms of 'conservative' vs. 'liberal' values (e.g. path name lengths).
Still, it's worth thinking about how to change HZ.  A fixed 100HZ timer
tick is nice in terms of low overhead, but is kind of a pain for low
latency work.
I've got a piece of hardware in front of me with eight timer interrupts.
It's begging for periodic-tick on one plus earliest-timer on another.
Be nice if someone adds such support to Linux before I get around to
porting it :-)
