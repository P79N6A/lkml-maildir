  I can imagine a solution to this using the _same_ method - extend
  /proc/*/ with a new entry (say, trace) for dumping errors. Put data
  in there from every failing function in your code. Normally, this
  will not introduce overheads (not unless you use error conditions to
  pass on useful information), however, in case of errors, you can
  get the backtrace (together with any info you want to put in there)
  immediately.

  That's all up to you. Informational messages can go to /proc.
  Transactions/serialization can be done in your filesystem's
  implementation. Maybe glibc guys would even want to extend
  strerror() to handle these cases?
