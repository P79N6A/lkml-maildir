I've looked and looked but can't find the proper person to send this to, so 
I'm throwing it out here. There's one offending line that causes mine and 
others' Dell Latitde LS(t) laptops to freeze up. Remove it and everything 
works perfectly. I'm using 2.4.17 but I think this driver has remained the 
same for quite some time now.
