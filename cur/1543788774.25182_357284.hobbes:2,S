The IRQ off times look like the worst . If you do "make menuconfig"
then goto Kernel Hacking and select 
"Interrupts-off critical section latency timing"
Then select "Latency tracing"
Then when you boot the system before run the following,
"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency"
 
That will record a trace for every maximum latency observed for IRQ
latency . You can view the trace with this command
"cat /proc/latency_trace" , and you can attach the trace to an email to
LKML so we can review it (compress it if it's big though) .
