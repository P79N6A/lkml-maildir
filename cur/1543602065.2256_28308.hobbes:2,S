arp_filter is not enough:
   with arp_filter enabled, both node 1 and 2 will answer to "who is 1.1.1.11?".
hidden patch + arp_filter:
   If the hidden and arp_filter patches can be applied on top of each other(?),
   one still has to be careful configuring the system.  In the example with
   loopback hidden, you'll notice that no one will answer "who is 1.1.1.11?".
   Further, arp_filter (which is based on routing) may have side effects from
   asymmetric routing, multiple nic's on same subnet, and default routes.
This example illustrates the problem and that the distributions does not have
enough to solve. In addition, I need something simpler for field deployment.
Strict_interface_arp I hope will provide the needed simplicity and control.

That's the "arp flux" problem which strict_interface_arp solves.
In Linux arp requests, it is possible for 2.2.2.1 eth1 node1 to be advertised
as source by eth0 node1. For illustration, eth0 is 10/100M and eth1 is gigabit.
It'll cause clients to redirect traffic for the gigabit to the 10/100M port.
It does not appear rp_filter can solve this.
