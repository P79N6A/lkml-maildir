If the kernel was stable (reliability wise - as in "not crashing") then
you'd be perfectly right.
In the real world, however, admins currently need to pick out specific
versions of the kernel for specific workloads (try running a large
fileserver on anything but 2.6.11.11 for example - any earlier or later
kernel will barf reliably. For web serving it's another kernel that's
golden, I forgot which).
There are very very good reasons for offering a 'stable series' in plain
source-tree form - lots of admins of real-world systems need this.
Adrian, I like the idea :)
