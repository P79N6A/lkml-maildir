That applies for every OS, if there isn't any maintenance done and bugs
keep being discovered, it will become insecure.
Just because in a few years the patch may not be so useful as it is now,
is no reason to include it.
Why bother porting to IA64 if we know the architecture will be obsolete in
10 years or so?
It's useful NOW, so let's include it NOW.

This kernelpatch will not repair bind.
However, it will, when properly configured, give you warnings about
certain possible security issues in ANY userspace code run.
This is not a solution, but a tool to help control the results that may
occur due to a programming booboo.
Like I said before, try it out, see if you can outsmart it and then give
proper comments, don't start comparing things that don't relate to this
patch.

I have a tremendous respect for Linus, but, he 's not the only person that
codes for linux.
He is human ( at least so I 've heard ;) he made a judgement based on his
personal interpretation of linux, the patch, the userbase opinion and
state of technologie at that moment.
If the world was a static place, his decision then shouldn't be
questioned, but it's not.
I have my owm mind and can think of my own, just because someone else has
an opinion I don't have to share it.
This is a discussion that should be based on current facts and emotions,
hiding behind someone elses decision without facts to back that decision
up isn't a valuable contribution in my opinion.
