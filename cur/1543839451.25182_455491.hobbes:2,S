IMHO the stable series is 2.6.x.y nowadays. 2.6.z (without a fourth
number) is more or less what used to be 2.<odd> previously.

AFAIK nothing is broken, but the messages are annoying. Especially since
99.9% of the time they're caused not by the applications but by glibc.
So the message should be heavily rate limited at least, if that's not
already done.
