Yani,
	What company has ever released a Linux driver, just for the heck of it, or
simply because they wanted it out? Hell no.
(maybe a couple odd ones)
We have to be persistent and ask them to release something, we paid a lot of
money, and I have been missinformed to the fact that IBM loved Linux and
wanted to "support it". Looks like a big lie to me. They don't even need to
release a driver, just information. It is not even something that they only
have. Now we all know that Analog Devices makes the hardware. Not them.
So much for anything. I will keep asking for this information.
If people would send emails to IBM like I have, instead of complaining and
doing pilitical arguments, we probably would have an answer already.
.Alejandro
