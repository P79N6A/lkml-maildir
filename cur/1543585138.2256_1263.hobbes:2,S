Well andrew,
I yet have to find something like absolute perfect in the technology domain,
me agree with you that the following chipsets are broken but then there
is'nt any for which any of us can claim that it'z not broken or will not in
sometimez in future, anyway here is some information that i think guruz
dealing with ATA development must know about it to bring sanity of those who
are not guruz.
At the time of  (e-ide) driver initialisation

AFAIK inetl's 82371AB chipset never supported UDMA 66 mode then why driver
initialised it like this...
Right now i placed a line somewhere in my rc.sysinit script
hdpatm -d1 -X34 /dev/hdX to reslove the dead lock i was facing whenever
tried to mount the specified drive.
Any suggestion........
