I'm sure all those assumptions are baked-in to the estimate.  Yet the
fact remains that people's eyes are only so good and most people will
be reading at similar distances from the screen.  So I don't see any
reason to invalidate those assumptions.  FWIW, I find reading longer
lines to be painful -- it is easier to loose one's place in the text.
I would also echo a point Jeff Garzik made elsewhere that it is often
beneficial to have multiple windows oppen side-by-side.  Longer lines
makes it harder to do that in a useful way.  Instead the lines either
wrap or just trail off the screen.  See the output of sdiff for how
this limits usefulness.

I'm not sure deeply indented code is ever a snap to understand.
And FWIW, I'd rather deal with "artificial" line breaks than parameter
lists that just stream off the side of the page.  The line breaks
make long parameters lists easier to digest.  I'll sacrifice the
occasional odd breakage of a long string.
