No exactly. The payload information must be always available for
application.
On a second thought, the idea of one big taskstats struct with many
#ifconfig is not really a good idea. My goal is to cut down unnecessary
data being transfered throught the socket.
Here is my Take 2. We can have a  taskstats header containing taskstats
version and other general fields useful to more than one taskstats
application including a payload information. Then, we define
accounting subsystem specific structs for delayacct, csa, etc.
The kernel/{delayacct.c,csa.c,etc.c} set the payload information and
fill the buffer with desired subsystem structs. The header thus contain
enough information to tell  applications how to map the data following
the header.
Would IBM propose more accounting subsystems besides delayacct?
If we only see delayacct and csa on the horizon, this scheme is really
not necessary since delayacct does not have as much data (as csa :))
and csa can use part of the delayacct data. You gain more than
csa can benefit from this. ;-) I guess i just speak from design point
of view. :)
But, if one day somebody who does not need a paycheck decides
to convert BSD accounting to use taskstats interface, this can
be helpful.
