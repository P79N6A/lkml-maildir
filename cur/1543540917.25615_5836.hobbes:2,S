Subject: Draft #6 of Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt

This document describes the kernel Makefiles from the point of view of
a non-kbuild kernel developer.  It includes sections on subdirectory
Makefiles, arch Makefiles, Rules.make variables (both old-style and
new-style), and so on.  The patch also documents the requirement that
building the kernel requires Gnu Make 3.77 or higher.
Draft #6 has:
    + Removal of MOD_LIST_NAME
    + The usual round of nit fixes
It's available at:
    
ftp://ftp.shout.net/pub/users/mec/kbuild/x-Dkm-6.diff
This is a release candidate.  I'm going to send this to Linus soon,
unless a proverbial "brown paper bag bug" shows up.
Michael
