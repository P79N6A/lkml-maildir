Just like the network auto-configuration via dhcp, it would allow users 
to download images+kernel and run them like appliances without 
understanding anything about X or UML, just click and run.
We are all capable of setting up Xvfb here, but most users are not, 
which is why they download ready-made images.
It would also make it a lot easier to focus on writing a management UI, 
hell if there isn't one shortly after, I'll do one myself!
Think of a UML browser image (running IE via wine in a limited image 
with just X + wine + IE - I would much prefer that to having wine+IE 
installed locally), testing framebuffer apps like gtk-fb/cairo-fb 
without risking your dev environment, etc...
