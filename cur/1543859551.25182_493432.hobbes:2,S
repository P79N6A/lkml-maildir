Because it works on the common hardware? If there's documentation about 
what userspace can legitimately expect, then I'm happy to defer to that. 
But in the absence of any indication as to what functionality users can 
depend on, deciding that existing functionality is a bug is, well, 
impolite.

Is rfkill not just primarily an interface for us getting events when the 
radio changes state? Every time I read up on it I get a little more 
confused - some time I really need to make sense of it...
