Yes that's pretty weird. I admit I hadn't expected
that problem. blink is equivalent to "annoy me" and it
is a mystery why so many people should willingly ask their computer to 
annoy them.
Or perhaps they update their configs with yes | make oldconfig? 
User psychology can be mysterious.
I wonder if the kernel offered a CONFIG_FORMAT_FILESYSTEMS_AT_BOOT
how many people would enable that @) Might be an interesting experiment
for next April.

Forcing a suitable slow rate should fix that shouldn't it? We need
that anyways to stop the "setleds DOS".

Yes that would be probably a good idea; even though it is technically
not correct: the debug kernel doesn't try to debug itself. But anyways,
it's probably the best place.

The kcrash kernel doesn't necessarily need to have kexec enabled by
itself.

Yes that would be probably a better implementation. Also hook something
for USB keyboards. iirc Bernhard Walle (cc'ed) was looking at that.
