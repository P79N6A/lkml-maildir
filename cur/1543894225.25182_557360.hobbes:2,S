I certainly read that as 'trying to force people to be good is just as
crazy as trying to force people to not be gay'.  Some people are good,
and some aren't (no idea why), and similarly some people are gay and
some aren't (again, no idea why).  Neither can be changed by declaring
that it must be changed.
I always love Linus' analogies. :)
