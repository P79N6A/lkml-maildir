Yeah, it works, but the current omap code in the mainline kernel is still
mostly at 2.6.18 level like you mentioned.

window, then another two weeks for merging board and driver specific
stuff?
That would make it easier to update the board and driver specific
patches to the common code and interface changes first before they
are submitted.
