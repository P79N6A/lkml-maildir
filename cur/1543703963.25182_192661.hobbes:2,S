Odd.  I don't have the raw char device configured.  Issuing the raw 
command as root gives the mentioned error message, which now seems 
logical.  I'm not sure why mm kernels gave that error and others don't.
Someone else suggested that one of my problems was caused by hotplug 
scripts.  I updated to the 2004-01-05 version and I'm not getting the 
/dev/rawctl error anymore.
