[... rest of patch skipped ...]
After this change the size of files which can be created on an UDF
filesystem becomes limited to 1GB.  This is very unfortunate - in
particular, it means that there will be no way to write a file larger
than 4GB to a DVD under Linux (mkisofs -udf does not support files
larger than 4GB, so the typical workaround was to use mkudffs and
mount -o loop).  In fact, this change may be considered as a
regression - large files on UDF seemed to work before (at least in
simple cases), and now they are forbidden.
Files larger than 1GB can be read even after this patch (because
s_maxbytes is not checked in read paths, and udf does not use
generic_file_lseek()), so old disks at least can be read.
What issues with files larger than 1GB have been found in the code?
Is someone working to fix these problems?
