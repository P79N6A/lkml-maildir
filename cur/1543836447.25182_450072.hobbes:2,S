I would like to mention about it more.
We asked not to make memory hole to firmware team before.
But, conclusion became NO. 
Because this hole is made for memory partial broken case. 
Current ACPI doesn't have any spec to tell which memory area is
broken. So, _CRS must return address range of only sane memory area.
In addition, partial broken area should be smaller as much as possible.
This is why he mention about memory hole.
BTW, I prefer that we should fix only bug at this time for 2.6.18.
But, I really confusing that current patches are for only bug fix or
including for small memory hole case.
IIRC, small memory hole need more works. So, it should be 2.6.19
or later. Right?
Kame-san, could you divide between just fix patch and considering
small hole case? Or all of patches are for only bug fix?
Bye.
