If you read the thread again carefully, you will see that I already said
that it doesn't tell you who is at fault for the bug. Furthermore, I
said that the basis of the resistance of some developers to the use of
this is that they are not fully convinced that others understand that it
identifies only the assertion writer not the bug writer. As the boss of
the guys writing these assertions, I see no reason to indulge baseless
fears. When guys become experienced members of our team, they lose this
fear. Sending the bug report to the assertion writer often works nicely
as a first step, in my project, in my experience, in the cases where I
don't know anything about the likely implications of the assertion myself.
