Ugh. OK, first of all, patch is _not_ correct. Doesn't zero out the end of
partial block.
<note to myself: no patches before the first cup of coffee>
We know that ->writepage() is called and we know that data doesn't get to
the disk. How can it happen? If we can... Oh, fsck. Linus, we could very
well lose the buffers since the moment when page had been read. See what
happens? We recreate the buffer ring for the page and it's nowhere near
"everything uptodate" state.
So yes, reading the buffers is the problem. I'll fix the zero-out part
of that and send the corrected variant. From my reading of
__block_write_full_page() it looks like we are OK wrt assumptions about
the bh state there, but we may need to check other places where we use
prepare_write().
