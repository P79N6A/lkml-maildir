Because it is quite likely you'll have to page in the first page of
the process stack, just for ps.  That's pretty silly.  ps is already
intrusive enough - we should be spending time on making sure ps
is more efficient, not less.
The performance hit when running top or ps during serious database
workloads is significant (20% or higher in 2.2 kernels!).

Blech.  ps/procfs has no business poking around in the address space of another
process.   If you absolutely _must_ have ps showing the state of some
process, then construct a new non-standard system call.
Once multiple page size support for apps is available, it will be a given
that the location of argv[0] will _not_ be fixed (at least between 
page sizes), now you've added additional special case code to ps and/or procfs
whenever the kernel supports additional page sizes (like on mips, 
ia64, et. al).
For the most part, e.g. innd, sendmail, there are other ways to determine
the current status (ctlinnd, mailq) of the process, and such is as it
should be.
