The initrd end address should be obtained via the following algorithm:
        # high_addr here is the highest byte that can be occupied by
        # the initrd
	if ( bootproto >= 0x203 ) {
	   high_addr := header->ramdisk_max
        } else {
           high_addr := 0x37ffffff
        }
        high_addr := min(memsize-1, high_addr)
The "magic constant" 0x37ffffff was widely believed to have been
0x3bffffff (which it might have originally been); this value, however,
doesn't work with most kernels.
This is why the ramdisk ceiling needs to be explicitly reported by the
kernel, as is done in the 2.03 boot protocol.
