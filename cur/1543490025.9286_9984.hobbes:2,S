Yes.  It still requires that a driver allocate a section of memory that it
is going to be using for PCI communication.  There's no way around this.
I (the original poster) don't know if a scatter-gather solution is required
(it is supported by alpha hardware, I don't know about others).  It may be
possible to do it without scatter-gather support in hardware.  At any rate,
it looks like all device drivers that are going to be using PCI transfers
will have to do something like:
bus_alloc(<buffer address>, <size>);
out(virt_to_bus(<buffer address>), HARDWARE_DO_SOMETHING_PORT);
[...]
bus_dealloc(<buffer address>);
virt_to_bus is currently implemented, but cannot on the fly determine how to
reallocate mappings so as to not clobber another device, unless it is told
(via my bus_alloc or something similar) who is using what regions of the PCI
address space.
Note that using this bus_alloc/bus_dealloc implementation allows the driver
to keep several buffers.  Also note that giving the hardware a different
address within the buffer should work fine too.  (out(virt_to_bus(<buffer
address> + 0x4000), HARDWARE_DO_SOMETHING_PORT) etc.)
On alpha scatter-gather is simply an address translation scheme that allows
small granularity (8kb).  I don't know how much kernel support beyond
bus_alloc/virt_to_bus/bus_dealloc would be required to implement bounce
buffers using the scatter-gather mappings.  Perhaps someone who understands
bounce buffers would care to comment?  (I'm still not sure what they are...)
I wonder if it would be possible to take a poll of hardware owners to
determine which chipsets support scatter-gather.  I don't know if this is
part of the PCI spec, or a hack implemented by Digital and Sun.  Will Merced
chipsets support scatter-gather?  At any rate, a generic
bus_alloc/bus_dealloc should be able to hide whatever memory->bus remapping
the hardware supports...whether scatter-gather exists on all chipsets or
not.
Most importantly: if bounce buffers are required to access memory >1GB from
PCI, can it be done with a simple bus_alloc/virt_to_bus/bus_dealloc?  Or
must we implement a more complex solution that can handle both cases?
