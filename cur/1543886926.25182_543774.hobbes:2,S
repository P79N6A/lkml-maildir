Ok, thanks for the explanation.  Sounds like we're using high port
numbers in the "spirit" of the IANA recommendation, without using
their actual numbers.
I still haven't gotten an answer to this: is there a performance
issue (or memory usage or security or something) with using the same
port range in all cases, even on memory-constrained systems?  And if
there is, can't we *still* use big numbers, even if the range isn't
as wide?
If there's no reason not to (security, resource consumption,
whatever), I think it would be an improvement to use high, out of the
way port numbering in all cases.  (Especially since the kernel already
does this on most of my machines, anyway.)
There was a comment in there about how 32768-61000 should be used on
high-use systems; is there a drawback to just using this range
*everywhere*?  (It's already the default in non-memory-constrained
cases, because of what tcp_init() was doing.)
Thanks,
