Subject: [patch 0/2] RCU: fix various latency/oom issues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are the patches that I have been testing that should help
some of the latency and OOM issues (file limit) that we had
discussed in the past. If the patchset looks ok,
we should probably queue them up in -mm for some testing before
merging. I have lightly tested the patchset on both ppc64 and x86_64 
using ltp, dbench etc.
Thanks
Dipnkar
