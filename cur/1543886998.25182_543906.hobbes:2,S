Subject: why does x86 "make defconfig" build a single, lonely module?

  not a big deal, but is there a reason that a "make defconfig" on my
x86 system ends up selecting and building a single module?
  Building modules, stage 2.
  MODPOST 1 modules
  CC      drivers/scsi/scsi_wait_scan.mod.o
  LD [M]  drivers/scsi/scsi_wait_scan.ko
is there something special about that module?  just curious.
