Sure, trusted kernel and trusted executables,  but it's easier than it
sounds.  If you start with a "clean" system, you don't need to verify
excutables _if_ they're coming from the secured file server (by
induction: if you started out secure, the executables on the file server
will remain secure).  You simply can't trust the local disk from one
user to the next.  Following the protocol, a student can log into a
machine, su to do their OS homework, but not compromise the security of
the distributed file system.
If I can su while another user is logged in, or the kernel/cmds are not
validated between users, cryptfs isn't safe either.
If you're following the protocol, it doesn't even matter if a bad guy
("untrusted user"?) gets root on the client--they still can't gain
inappropriate access to the file server.  OTOH, if my security plan is
simply to not allow root access to untrusted users, history says I'm
going to lose.

Unless you _are_ root and can check every executable, after presumably
rebooting into your own trusted kernel, then those requirements won't
mean squat. If you're that paranoid, then you will presumably also be
using a cryptfs-encrypted partition for cachefs, which you unmount when
you're not logged in.
That said, most cluster environments will tend to put most of their
security resources into keeping untrusted users out altogether. The
client nodes tend to be a homogeneous lot with presumably only a trusted
few sysadmins...
