Read-only works fine for me, too and I have limited write functionality 
(copying files on top of each other works fine, deleting files doesn't work 
leaving "broken file-like structures" for a future "chkdsk /f" under NT to 
sort out). - read-only works perfectly though - I have lots of things on my 
NTFS partition including my freshly downloaded rpms, tar balls, etc and I 
read them from linux without any problems so I don't see why NTFS 
(read-only at least) needs to be removed. - Maybe mark it as unsupported + 
experimental + whatever else in the configure scripts but please keep it 
in, there are people (including me) who rely on it working since NT is a 
long way away from reading ext2 partitions... (if someone wants to prove me 
wrong, please do so).
And no I can't maintain the ntfs driver myself since my linux kernel 
hacking experience is almost equal to zero atm and I also don't know 
anthing about ntfs workings either...
