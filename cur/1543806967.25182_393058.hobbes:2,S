IMHO, this should use explicitly sized integers like __u8, __u16 etc, unless 
there are stringent reasons like better register use - which is hard to tell 
for generic C code. Also, why on earth is the returntype for hweight64 a 
long?

Why not use unsigned constants here?

Why not use initialisation here, too?
just my 2c
