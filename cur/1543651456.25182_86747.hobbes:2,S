In /proc there are a bunch of directories that are numbered.
These numbers correspond to the PID of each process.
In each of these directories is a file called "status".
This file contains most all the information you need just
in case you don't like `ps` or `top`.
Name:	init
State:	S (sleeping)
Tgid:	1
Pid:	1
PPid:	0
TracerPid:	0
Uid:	0	0	0	0
Gid:	0	0	0	0
FDSize:	32

VmSize:	     224 kB              Total virtual memory accessed so far.
