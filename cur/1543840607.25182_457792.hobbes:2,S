DMA is not done only to the DMA zones. The DMA zone is for devices that 
can only address 24-bit addresses (ISA/LPC devices). The DMA32 zone is 
for devices that can only address 4GB of memory.
I suppose you could say there is a bit of an imbalance between nodes but 
hopefully these are both (especially ZONE_DMA) rarely used in any sane 
setup so it wouldn't make much difference. Since these zones are based 
on bus-visible physical addresses I'm not sure if this could be fixed in 
any case.
