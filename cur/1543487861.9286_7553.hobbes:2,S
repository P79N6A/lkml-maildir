Basically like you showed:
USER					KERNEL
sched_setscheduler (SCHED_FIFO...);
					check_perms ();
					rt_put_on_run_queue ();
loop:
do_something ();
write (fd, buffer, size);
					rt_take_from_run_queue ();
					do_as_usual ();
					maybe_block ();
					rt_put_on_run_queue ();
goto loop;
				Regards,
					Richard....
