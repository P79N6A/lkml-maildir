BTW, what happened to AHCI softreset patch. It got acked[1], but it has 
not made into the tree yet. Do you want me to regenerate it against the 
current tree? Or is there anything holding it from going into the tree?

If hardreset never works on via ahci, simply omitting hardreset in 
ahci_probe_reset() routine for that controller should do the job (with 
the AHCI softreset patch applied of course).
