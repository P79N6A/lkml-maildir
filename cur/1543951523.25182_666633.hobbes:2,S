When doing this it would be useful to print a warning iif the watchdog was running.
I.E. the following would be possible for the w83697:
init() {
  if (watchdog_already_running) {
     printk("warning, stopping watchdog. Use the nodisable option to keep running");
     disable_watchdog();
  }
}
See the w83627 driver for how to determine watchdog is running.

cool, thanks.
Pádraig.
p.s. I'm still not sure it should default to turning off.
It would be unusual for userspace to take over 60s to _start_
If that was the case then the user shouldn't enable the watchdog in the BIOS at all.
