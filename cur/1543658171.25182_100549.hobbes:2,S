CRC code seems to be functional, at least in their most recent drop.
As for ERL, the state of error handling in the rest of the Linux IO
layer suggests that's a lower triage priority..
If and when it becomes a high priority, well, the community is free to do what
it likes with the source.

I'm having a very hard time making any sense of that statement.
There's no reason an iSCSI initiator on the MS side should care what
OS is serving it iSCSI. And the target shouldn't give a damn whether
it's serving up a filesystem.

Frankly, I think you're the one choosing the hard path. Proprietary
code is the domain of corporate giants and you're likely to get
squished - marketing matters more than quality. If you choose to go
that road, I wish you the best of luck.
