Well... First of all (to Eric), the 4kb pages isn't the issue. Only if
you have limited sg capabilities in your hardware AND need larger
segment sizes to get up in the range of request sizes that makes that
hardware go fast would you benefit from always using bigger pages. And
market pressure should indeed make you lose, if you design crappy
hardware like that.
Secondly, choice isn't always good. Linux should cater to the hardware
only to the extent that it makes sense. We don't make design decisions
that are unmaintainable or cripple us in some way because of bad
hardware. That would be stupid.
If we need and want larger IO sizes, then we can do that without big
compound pages. I'm merely interested in the bigger page cache pages
because it'll solve several issues at once.
