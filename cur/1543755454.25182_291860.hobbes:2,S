Well, counting the atomic copy in the "3.5s average just for getting the
time" doesn't quite seem fair, but I think I understand. Its
interesting, I wasn't aware of the suspend/copy/resume process that
occurs for suspend-to-disk. The thing I don't quite get is why are the
resume methods called before we really suspend to disk?

Well, I'm not sure what else we could use for the persistent clock, but
I'd be happy to change the read/set_persistent_clock function to use it.
