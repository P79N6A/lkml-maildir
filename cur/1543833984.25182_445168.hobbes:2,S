No, this patch is OK (in that respect).  As long as the git-bisect user
sets CONFIG_XEN=n (and surely he will), things will compile.
That being said,
+mflags-$(CONFIG_X86_XEN)	:= -Iinclude/asm-i386/mach-xen
+mcore-$(CONFIG_X86_XEN)		:= mach-xen
+
 # generic subarchitecture
 mflags-$(CONFIG_X86_GENERICARCH) := -Iinclude/asm-i386/mach-generic
 mcore-$(CONFIG_X86_GENERICARCH) := mach-default
@@ -99,6 +103,7 @@ drivers-$(CONFIG_PM)			+= arch/i386/powe
 CFLAGS += $(mflags-y)
 AFLAGS += $(mflags-y)
+CPPFLAGS += $(mflags-y)
This change affects _all_ subarchitectures (by potentially altering their
CPPFLAGS) and it's rather a mystery why one subarch needs the -Ifoo in its
CPPFLAGS whereas all the others do not.
