Be careful that your viewer doesn't disturb the system.
Please don't even consider using "top" for this.

If cache problems are bad enough, maybe this pays for itself:
/* old */
current = stack_ptr & ~0x1fff;
/* new */
hash = (stack_ptr>>8)^(stack_ptr>>12)^(stack_ptr>>16)^(stack_ptr>>20);
current = (stack_ptr & ~0x1fff) | (hash & 0x1e0);

Like "top"!
