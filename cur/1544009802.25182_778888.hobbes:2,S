This will likely fix my T43 to power down USB during STR. THANKS!!
Now, I just need to check if the ACPI BIOS is smart enough to not do
it when they are configured as wake devices [in the BIOS].
Although I do wonder WTF we don't do that on our USB UHCI/EHCI kernel
drivers, that ACPI needs to step in to fix it.  If it is not a wake
device, why are we leaving it powered up?  It is bad enough we don't
have any sort of proper USB power control, but to leave the entire USB
subsystem powered up without reason?!
Vista not only powers down the USB HCIs and ports on STR, it also
powers down ports when you "safely remove the USB device", and seems
to leave the port powered down until you insert a device (or remove
the device already in there, whatever).
