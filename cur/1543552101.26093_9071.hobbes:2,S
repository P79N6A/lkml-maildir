fine with me, it makes my code even shorter.  ;-)  This new mmap
solution is really elegant.  Excluding all the debug code and assertions
I stick in there, the guts of via audio mmap support went from ~50 lines
to ~10.

Thanks, fixed.
I stole the last two lines from drivers/char/drm/vm.c, which might need
to be fixed up also..  He uses the vm_flags above and nevers calls
get_page, at the very least.
