Well it has to be a new thread, or user processes.
Would it be possible to mark the inode as "needs invalidation",
and make user processes check that flag once they have i_sem?

Yes, clearing PageUptodate without holding the page lock is
pretty scary.
Do we really need to invalidate individual pages, or is it real-life
acceptable to invalidate the whole mapping?
Doing an NFS-special invalidate function is not a problem, btw - my
current invalidate_inode_pages() is just 25 lines.  It's merely a
matter of working out what it should do ;)
