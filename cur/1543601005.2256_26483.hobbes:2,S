I'm not really much of an expert on the memory management. I try to
stick to doing NFS. If you are interested in the exact mechanisms of
page reclaiming, you might want to try to study the function
try_to_free_pages() in mm/vmscan.c. It never stops changing though ;-)

Not to my knowledge, but as I say, I'm not really an expert...
Cheers,
