Hello,
I'm wondering what is wrong with my system: It is an ASUS-M266D,
(760MPX-chipset, 768 Northbridge, 762 southbridge) that comes with a USB
2.0-NEC card, but it has an USB 1.1 onboard controller. I'm using a single
AthlonXP processor.
The distribution I'm using is SuSE 8.0, but I have installed the Marcelo
2.4.20 kernel and later the Marcelo 2.4.21-pre4 kernel with no success.
As soon as I load the ohci-module for the onboard controller the system
freezes.  (there was in an earlier versions a hw-bug in the chipset, but
as far as I know my chipset has a newer revision, where this has been
fixed). This also happens, if I unload first the Ehci-module for the
USB2.0-card.
I also tried Knoppix 3.1 and it only boots, if I switch off the
usb-probing on the boot-prompt, otherwise it also freezes.
If I load the standard kernel that comes with the Suse-distribution 8.0
the usb-port works. What is wrong? If you need further information please
ask.
I looked at the log-files, but did not find any message related to the
crash.
I'm not on the mailing list, so if you have any hint, please CC also to
me.
Thanks a lot.
	Klaus
