It's logical though. :)

Your patch seems to be against test1 vanilla -- it doesn't apply to -bk3.
> +menuconfig IDE
How exactly does menuconfig work, anyway?
It's not a "block command" -> how will kconf know which entries to put
in the submenu?
What if I have
	menuconfig FOO
		bool "foo"
	menuconfig BAR
		bool "bar"
	config BAZ
		bool "baz"
		depends on FOO && BAR
Where is BAZ going to show up and why?
