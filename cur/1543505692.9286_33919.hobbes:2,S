There isn't much new about that. It's just a way of approaching and using
the technology inside field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's).
Whatever generic-use chips will be made, there will always be an advantage
to special purpose chips: power and speed. The more specialized a chip
becomes, the better it will perform for the task it has been specialized
for, using lower power and achieving higher speeds. There will always be
big variations in the applications for computational power. You just don't
care much about a 40Watt CPU inside a desktop PC, but you do inside your
mobile phone.
