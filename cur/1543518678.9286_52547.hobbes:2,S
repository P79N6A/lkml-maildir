I had a similar problem uploading to a 2.2.12 system either Windows 98 or
Windows NT 4.0sp6a.  (I think I sent a message to linux-kernel in the past
week or so.)  After seeing this message I tried turning off tcp_sack and that
fixed it completely.
I suggest that tcp_sack be turned off by default unless there is some way to
detect and work around broken implementations on the other of a connection.
