I am guilty of not providing enough information.
Kernel 2.2.10 (stock), K6-2/400, 256M,
eth0: 3c509 at 0x340 tag 1, 10baseT port, address  00 10 4b b9 c8 15, IRQ 5.
3c509.c:1.16 (2.2) 2/3/98 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov.
The machine was loaded with close to 50% 10Mbps ethernet, mostly apache and
ftp.
