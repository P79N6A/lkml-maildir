Well I spose slab _could_ take a ref on these pages.

OK.  Let's go through it.
Networking internally maintains caller memory lifetimes, and it assumes
that the caller allocated memory via __alloc_pages() - because it uses
get_page() and put_page().
BIO, however, does not internally manage caller memory lifetime.  This is
because the caller's ->bi_end_io is always called, so the caller can do it.
So where we've come unstuck is in a module which has gone and fed BIO
memory into networking.  The differing design philosophies are clashing.
I'm surprised this doesn't happen in other places - aren't there any other
drivers which take a BIO and stuff it down the network?
Anyway, where's the bug?
Really, I'd say it's XFS (and ext3).  Even though BIO doesn't presently
manage page lifetimes, it _could_.  After all, the function is called
bio_add_page(), not bio_add_virtual_address().  It's a bit hacky to kmalloc
some memory, run virt_to_page() and to then present that page to BIO even
though the caller (thanks to the slab optimisation) doesn't actually have
control of that page's lifetime.
So we have a few options to look at:
a) kludge things in AOE.  Unpleasing, and might cause memory leaks
   (although it won't, because the caller hasn't run bi_end_io yet).
b) Take a ref on slab pages in slab.  A bit costly, perhaps.
c) teach ext3 and XFS to take a ref on these pages as they are added to
   the BIOs, undo that ref in bi_end_io.
I think c)?
