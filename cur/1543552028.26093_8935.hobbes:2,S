Actually, that isn't completely true, as the Makefile still has the same
problem as before.  Keith's comments get us closer, but still not quite

The patch doesn't solve the versioned symbol problem directly, sorry.
But it still a good idea anyway :)
I'll look into the Makefile stuff more tomorrow.
