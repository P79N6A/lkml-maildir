Linux rarely forces a reschedule, because interrupt handlers cannot
block.  So we have the need_resched variable (in 2.6, a flag in
thread_info) to note if a reschedule is pending.
The scheduler is then invoked asap.

Yes, this is true.  With kernel preemption enabled, if a task is
executing in the kernel, and an interrupt occurs that marks
need_resched, the reschedule will take place immediately on return from
interrupt UNLESS a lock is held.  In which case the reschedule will
occur when the lock is released (specifically, when preempt_count hits
zero).
Without kernel preemption, the reschedule will not take place until the
executing task in the kernel blocks and a return to user-space occurs.
