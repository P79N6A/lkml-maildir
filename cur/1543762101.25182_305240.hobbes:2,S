My point was that there will always be a reference -anyway-, AFAICS. 
There is a pci_dev reference assigned to the pci_driver when the PCI 
driver is loaded, and all uses by the TPM generic code of this pointer 
are -inside- the pci_driver's pci_dev object lifetime.

You output -more- data than you have input.
AFAICS that's a security bug (data leak), unless you memset the data 
area beforehand.
