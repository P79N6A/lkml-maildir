Sorry, I wasn't able to apply it against 2.6.22-gentoo-r3 and vanilla
2.6.22.7; I don't have the "order" member in the "struct scan_control"
and also the bit about "if (sync_writeback == PAGEOUT_IO_SYNC &&
may_enter_fs)" was missing so there was no "else" branch to add (and it
seemd pretty significant to me). What version should I patch against?
When this is sorted out, should I keep the previous patch [1] applied as
well?
