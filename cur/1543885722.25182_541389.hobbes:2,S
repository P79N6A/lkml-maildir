Anton was on Cc: when I sent the first round of this patch.  He didn't
respond.

The problem certainly is generic and the patch already seperate.  I can
resend it in a seperate thread if that is preferred.
Until yesterday it appeared as if LogFS was the only code that could
trigger the problem.  NTFS is hard to judge without maintainer comment.
By now it appears as if JFS and NFS have joined in.  Maybe I was
over-cautious in not sending it for some month.
