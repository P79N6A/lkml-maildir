FWIW, I suspect that we are looking at that from the wrong POV.  If
that's about "who ought to be Cc'd on the issues dealing with <list
of pathnames>", why does it have to be tied to "who is maintainer for
<pathname>"?
I'm not suggesting something like fs.ext2@kernel.org with something
like majordomo allowing to add yourself to those, but something less
extreme in that direction might be worth thinking about...  Hell,
even simple
$ finger fs/minix/dir.c@cc.kernel.org
with majordomo-like interface for adding yourself to such lists
might solve most of those problems...
