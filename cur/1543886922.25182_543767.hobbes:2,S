Well.. It is actually a feature.
These days, you have to either add PF_NOFREEZE explicitly (which
hopefully means you know what you are doing) or add try_to_freeze() at
specific place.
If you fail to do that, we'll see freezer failure, quickly, and catch
the simple bug.
I'm afraid that if we default to "do not freeze by default", someone
will just port zfs, will know nothing about suspend, and his 
"write management info somewhere periodically" thread will corrupt
people's disks.
OTOH... perhaps suspend/resume is common enough operation that people
_know_ they need to stop their writing? ...no, I do not think we are
there yet.
