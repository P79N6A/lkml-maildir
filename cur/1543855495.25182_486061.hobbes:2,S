nope
Before :
---------
  offsetof(i_size) = 0x3C
i_size is 8 bytes, so i_size spans 2 cache lines (if 64 or 32 bytes cache lines)
and offsetof(i_size_seqcount) = 0x160, so a read of i_size (coupled with a 
read of seqcount) needed 3 cache lines. A change of i_size dirtied 2 or 3 
cache lines.
After :
--------
offsetof(i_size) = 0x40
offsetof(i_size_seqcount) = 0x48
One cache line 'only', reading or writing.
