Hi!
Since Linux2.2 I have to reboot my computer just to print.
I am printing quite seldom, therefore I switch my printer only on just
before printing and switch it off, when I am ready. This worked
pretty well with the 2.0.x-Kernels.
Since Kernel 2.2 the kernel seems to detect the hardware on lp* while
booting, and if I switch on the printer later, the kernel ignores it
and I can not print without a reboot.
Is this really intended? Why?
I have everything in my kernel compiled in, not via modules.
