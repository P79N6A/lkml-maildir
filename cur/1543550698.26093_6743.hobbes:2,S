Those versions surely are not good to start from for doing new ports.
There is almost 2 years of development gone since 2.95 was frozen and many
things have changed, so if you start with 2.95.2, you'll have a hard time
forward porting it to gcc 3.
With binutils it probably does not matter much, but it could be easier to
use CVS as well.
