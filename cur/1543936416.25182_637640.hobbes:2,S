Not exactly.  In the ACPI (aka platform) mode it's:
- pretend we're suspending and put everything into low power states
- snapshot memory
- power everything up
- save image
- suspend (ie. enter S4, suspending devices before).

First of all, the card need not be initialized at all before .resume() is called.

.suspend()/.resume() are used during suspend to RAM too.  As far as hibernation
is concerned, .resume() is used for two different purposes:
(a) to bring the device up after it's been put into a low power state for
    snapshotting memory
(b) to bring the device up (or reconfigure it if brought up already) after the
    hibernation image has been loaded and we're restoring the previous
    system state.

Yes, pnp_start_dev() is generally needed in .resume().
