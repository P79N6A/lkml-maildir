hello,
the PREEMPT_ACTIVE flag set by preempt_schedule() or during return of
interrupt / exception / syscall. And it's tested in schedule() to
avoid some operations like deactivate_task().
Our purpose is to force deactivation of the task. So we planned to set
task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE value and then to call
schedule(). However the PREEMPT_ACTIVE flag can prevent it.
So what is the significance of the PREEMPT_ACTIVE flag and the test in
schedule() ?
Sincerly, thanks in advance,
