	linux-2.6.0-test5/drivers/eisa fails to build if KBUILD_VERBOSE=1
in the top level Linux Makefile (KBUILD_VERBOSE=1 causes the build
process to show the actual commands that are being executed).
	linux-2.6.0-test5/drivers/eisa/Makefile contains a change
that tries to use the Linux KBUILD_VERBOSE system to control
echoing of a command that contains some single quotes.  It looks
like scripts/Makefile.lib contains some macros designed to put
backslashes in front of single quotes as necessary to handle this
case, but, somehow, this is not happening.  The build process attempts
to execute an echo command without the single quotes escaped, and the
result is a shell syntax error:
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=drivers/eisa
/bin/sh: -c: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `("'
/bin/sh: -c: line 1: `echo '  sed -e '/^#/D' -e 's/^\([[:alnum:]]\{7\}\) \+"\([^"]\{1,49\}\).*"/EISA_DEVINFO ("\1", "\2"),/' drivers/eisa/eisa.ids > drivers/eisa/devlist.h' && sed -e '/^#/D' -e 's/^\([[:alnum:]]\{7\}\) \+"\([^"]\{1,49\}\).*"/EISA_DEVINFO ("\1", "\2"),/' drivers/eisa/eisa.ids > drivers/eisa/devlist.h'
make[2]: *** [drivers/eisa/devlist.h] Error 2
make[1]: *** [drivers/eisa] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
	I'm not sure if this is a bug in drivers/eisa/Makefile or
some part of kbuild (probably something in scripts/Makefile.lib).
I do not see any changes in linux-2.6.0-test5-bk3 that look like
they would fix the problem, although I have yet to try it.
