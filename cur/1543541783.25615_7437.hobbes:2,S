Subject: DVD capacity bug for IDE CD's in linux-2.4.0-test6

	linux-2.4.0-test2 through linux-2.4.0-test7pre3 appear to
return garbage for the capacity of a DVD in an IDE (as opposed to SCSI)
drive.
	The problem has been exposed by a change to cdrom_read_toc
in drivers/ide/ide-cd.c.  Here is an excerpt from cdrom_read_toc:
	/* Now try to get the total cdrom capacity. */
	minor = (drive->select.b.unit) << PARTN_BITS;
	dev = MKDEV(HWIF(drive)->major, minor);
	stat = cdrom_get_last_written(dev, (long *)&toc->capacity);
	if (stat)
		stat = cdrom_read_capacity(drive, &toc->capacity, sense);
	if (stat)
		toc->capacity = 0x1fffff;
	Prior to linux-2.4.0-test2, the call to cdrom_get_last_written
had been commented out.  Now the call to cdrom_get_last_written
claims to have succeeded and returns garbage when reading a DVD.
I think this is because cdrom_get_last_written tries to return the
first sector of "lead out" data, but I vaguely recall reading that DVD's
do not have "lead out."  I tried putting other media in the drive:
another DVD and another CD-ROM.  The other DVD also was given a garbage
capacity and the CD-ROM was given an apparently correct capacity.
So, I am pretty sure that this problem manifests itself with all DVD's
and only DVD's in IDE drives.  The call to cdrom_get_last_written is
still commented out in the scsi driver, so this problem is only exposed
in the IDE driver.
	Here is a call graph of how the bogus data is returned
	Routine			File
	cdrom_read_toc		ide/ide-cd.c
	cdrom_get_last_written	cdrom/cdrom.c
	ide_cdrom_audio_ioctl	ide/ide-cd.c
	cdrom_get_toc_entry	ide/ide-cd.c
	cdrom_get_toc_entry returns data from the table of contents
data structure even though drive->toc_valid is 0.
	I guess there are few ways to fix this, although I am
not sure what the requirements are as far as what is allowed to
do potentially blocking I/O, etc.:
	1. cdrom_get_toc_entry can do something like:
		if (!CDROM_STATE_FLAGS(drive)->toc_valid)
			return -EIO;	/*Is there a better error to return?*/
	2. Perhaps cdrom_get_toc_entry could do some I/O to try to
	   read the table of contents when it is not already valid.
	   If the issue is that DVD's lack lead-out, then this might not
	   fix the problem.
	3. Perhaps cdrom_read_toc can be rearranged so that the table of
	   contents is valid by the time cdrom_get_last_written is called.
	   If the issue is that DVD's lack lead-out, then this might not
	   fix the problem.
	4. Perhaps cdrom_read_toc needs to do something special for DVD's
	   if indeed they lack lead-out.
	Side note: cdrom_read_toc does not look very IDE-specific to me.
Perhaps it might make sense to consider having one cdrom_read_toc
in cdrom/cdrom.c rather than one for IDE, one for SCSI, etc.  Probably
there is some reason that I do not understand for this.
