Hi,
   I'm pleased to announce the release of version 0.18.3 of the NFSv3
patches for kernel 2.2.14. This release should fix a number of
stability problems that have been reported on earlier releases.
New features:
	- Backport of linux-2.3 inode aliasing code. Basically this
	  relies on a simpler principle than the old 2.2 inode
	  aliasing hack.
	- Backport of linux-2.3 page IO marking scheme. Allows for
	  flushing of asynchronous writebacks while simultaneously
	  holding the page lock.
	- A number of possible page cache leaks, (and 1 embarrassing
	  memory corruption problem) fixed.
A number of people have contributed in stress-testing and
identification of problems. In particular I'd like to thank Jens
Hector and Steven Hirsch for relentless testing.
The current release of the NFSv3 patches can be found on
	
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/linux-2.2.14-nfsv3.dif.bz
It has also been checked in to the linux-NFS cvs server on
Sourceforge...
Please note that in order to mount NFSv3 partitions, you will need a
patched version of the 'mount' program. Patches and RPMS may be found
under
