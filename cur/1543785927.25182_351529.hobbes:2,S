Agreed.
Also, after Alan's #4:
5.  Contrary to the above statement, such coding style does not help,
    but in fact hurts, readability.  How on Earth is sizeof(*p) more
    readable and information-rich than sizeof(struct foo)?  It looks
    like the remains of a 5,000 year old wolverine's spleen and
    conveys no information about the type of the object that is being
    created.
