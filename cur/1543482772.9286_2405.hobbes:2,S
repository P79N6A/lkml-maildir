That's quite a lot, even though the dual-AXP with 200
simultaneous users sometimes exceeds this :)

That's not possible, but vmstat should give you enough
statistical information to help us out on this quest...

of disk subsystem, usage pattern) and vmstat and maybe
top output, then we can probably pinpoint the cause in
a minute or 2...
