exec.c: fix coredump to pipe problem and obscure "security hole"
The patch checks for "|" in the pattern not the output and doesn't nail a
pid on to a piped name (as it is a program name not a file)
Also fixes a very very obscure security corner case.  If you happen to have
decided on a core pattern that starts with the program name then the user
can run a program called "|myevilhack" as it stands.  I doubt anyone does
this.
