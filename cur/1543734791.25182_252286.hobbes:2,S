Understood.  Question is, if the request is for data that's associated
with a task that is in the middle of an execve(setuid_root_app), does
the credential-check/skb-fill for response happen atomically w.r.t. said
execve?  IOW, is it possible to pass credential check, then fill data
that's become sensitive since the check happened?
thanks,
