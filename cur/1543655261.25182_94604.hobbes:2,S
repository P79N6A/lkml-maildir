Hi Linus,
I know it would be a few extra lines of assembly code but it would be
nice if the restart routine had the original arguments.  Would it be too
ugly to do something like:
sys_restart_syscall:
	GET_THREAD_INFO(%eax)
	jmp	TI_RESTART_BLOCK(%eax)
I'm having second thoughts about even sending this.  Its just that I hate
casts more than I hate assembly code and using the restart_block to save 
the arguments implys casts.
