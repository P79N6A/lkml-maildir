   is it right that such an important part of the linux kernel (albeit
   user space) should not have adequate documentation? what is there
   uses tex. how about some manual pages?
Geeze, Alexey, in response to all the complaints about iproute having
no documentation, wrote an entire reference "book" documenting the
tool completely, and now this is not "adequate"?
If people want man pages instead, contribute by transforming the
excellant manual written by Alexey into man pages to your liking, and
submit them to Andi Klein so they make it into the netman project.
   i'm not trying to be rude to Alexey
You are.
