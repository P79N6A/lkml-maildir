Pretty much, yes.  As hinted at before, holes are just special cases
of a more general problem, block pointer handling.  On my hard drive,
there are literally millions of identical blocks.  If the filesystem
knew about those, it throw away most of them and just point to the
blocks from different files (or maybe just file positions).
A hole is simply a file offset pointing to a special and very common
shared block, but there are many others.
