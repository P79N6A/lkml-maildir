No, no.  Bad Martin!  Throughput didn't drop, "Specweb compliance" dropped. 
  Those are two very, very different things.  I've found that the server 
can produce a lot more throughput, although it doesn't have the 
characteristics that Specweb considers compliant.  Just have Troy enable 
mod-status and look at the throughput that Apache tells you that it is 
giving during a run.  _That_ is real throughput, not number of compliant 
connections.
_And_ NAPI is for receive only, right?  Also, my compliance drop occurs 
with the NAPI checkbox disabled.  There is something else in the new driver 
that causes our problems.
