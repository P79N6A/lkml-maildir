Why not the same access-once semantics for atomic_set() as
for atomic_read()?  As this patch stands, it might introduce
architecture-specific compiler-induced bugs due to the fact that
atomic_set() used to imply volatile behavior but no longer does.
See below for one approach to fixing this.

How about:
#define atomic_set(v,i)		((*(volatile int *)&(v)->counter) = (i))
#define atomic64_set(v,i)	((*(volatile long *)&(v)->counter) = (i))
