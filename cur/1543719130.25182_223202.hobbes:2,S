You mean that if you prime the cache by running find on the tree,
your actual operation doesn't take as long?
I don't doubt this. Slab cache is shrunk aggressively compared to
page cache. Traditionally I think this has been due at least in
part to some failure cases in the balancing there resulting in slab
growing out of control with some systems.
These failure cases should be fixed now, and slab vs pagecache is
probably something that should be looked at again. I really need
to get my hands on a 2GB+ system before I'd be game to start
fiddling with too much stuff though.
