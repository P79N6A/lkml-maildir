If the program does not use these cache lines then you have wasted time
in the page fault handler allocating and handling them. That is what
prezeroing does for you.

Yes but its a short burst that only occurs very infrequestly and it takes
advantage of all the optimizations that modern memory subsystems have for
linear accesses. And if hardware exists that can offload that from the cpu
then the cpu caches are only minimally affected.

Of course. The optimization depends on the type of load. If you use a
benchmark that writes to all pages in a page then you will see no benefit
at all. For a kernel compile you will see a slight benefit. For processing
of a sparse matrix (page tables are one example) a significant benefit can
be obtained.
