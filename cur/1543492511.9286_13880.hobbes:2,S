[1] At the moment, sudo doesn't have to know to look into elf headers
to restrict what the program can do.  It probably never will get this,
because that's outside the design concept of sudo.
[2] Scripts which use existing privileged executables would have to
be rewritten.  [Or, are you suggesting that all those executables
get replaced with shell scripts that call sudo?  This raises some
efficiency issues, and more backwards compatability issues.]
