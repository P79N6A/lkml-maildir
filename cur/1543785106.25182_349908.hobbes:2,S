Okay, so, I have so far gathered:
  - the whole module interface change between 2.4 and 2.6 was because 
some security concerns, most of the stuff (loading module etc.) moved 
towards kernel
  - query_module is gone, there is no syscall similar in function but 
with different name
  - losing of query_module also prevents binary-only modules 
(guesswork@work)
  - /proc/modules and /sys/module interface doesn't by far supply what 
query_module could do
My questions are:
a) Are my observations correct? Where did I go wrong?
b) Is there any planned replacement of query_module, or extendind sysfs 
or procfs module interface?
c) Wouldn't revamping query_module also allow binary-only modules, 
therefore easier decisions for vendors, whether to support Linux?
Thanks in advance and sorry for these probably quite silly questions.
