Because there are some machines (IBM thinkpad) where LEDs are either
driven by userspace, or driven by hardware. I'd like to export that
functionality using same interface.

Unfortunately hardware can not do that, at least for IBM
thinkpad. Plus, remapping harddisk indicator on battery led is not
something I'd like to support :-).
