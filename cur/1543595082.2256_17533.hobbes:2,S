Yes, the printks are only for debug and surely will be removed 
after some tests of the patch.

With pirq > 4 pirq_amd756_get should return 0, i left the
printk just to see if this happens in some test.
In the original 2.4.5 kernel (without patch), I get irq=0 for pirq=4
and that was the cause of the error with a SMC Lucent CardBus Bridge.
