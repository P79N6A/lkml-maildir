The few times I've used kobjects/sysfs, I would always need to "relearn"
how to use it. It's not trivial at all, and even when I finally get it
working, I'm not sure it's working correctly.
Although something like debugfs took me a few minutes to use. Now when
ever I need to do something that userspace uses, I simply choose debugfs.
I thought the switch to sysfs was to keep procfs cleaner and only used for
processes. Why did it need something so complex as the kobject structure?
Was it so that udev could integrate with it? If sysfs was as simple as
debugfs, I think a lot of these bugs would not have occurred.
