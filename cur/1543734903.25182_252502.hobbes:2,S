when you set softirq-preempt=1 and hardirq-preempt=1 then you also need
to make the soundcard's IRQ non-threaded via /proc/irq/*/*/threaded
(pick the right one that is your soundcard). E.g. i have a CMI8738-MC6 
on IRQ11, so i'd have to do this:
	echo 0 > /proc/irq/11/CMI8738-MC6/threaded
to mark the soundcard's interrupt as directly-executed.
