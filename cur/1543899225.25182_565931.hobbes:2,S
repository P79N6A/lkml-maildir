Oh, yes, more wrappers please!  We could do it at the paravirt_ops 
level: set up your pv_ops, then call paravirt_debug_mmuops(), which 
would save away your ops and replace them with wrappers.  That basic 
structure would lend itself to all kinds of paravirt-level debugging tools.
It would be a bit more elegant if we had mmu_ops.  Maybe we should do 
that splitup before 64bit?

Hm, would they?  Would they need to inspect the content of the pte_t 
(etc), or just look at the struct page for the page being updated?  (pmd 
operations being a bit more awkward, of course.)

Well, I have to say that keeping the hypervisor hints in sync with the 
actual kernel-level page state worries me, so any debug tools which 
could help there would be good.  This seems like it should be the right 
place to do it, but I can't say I've thought about it in any detail.
Of course, if it *is* helpful to the page hinting patches, then it 
suggests that it's a facility with wider scope than pv-ops.
