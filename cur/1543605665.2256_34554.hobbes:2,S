  Is this safe to try on SMP again? The one-previous 2.4.12-ac3 patch
seems stable on a P5-100+48MB RAM, which I use as a test for things
helping dog-slow systems, did not run well on a BP6 (crashed on first
login). I didn't report it because I try to have some useful info to
report and had no time.
  Also, has this been tested with experimental kernel pcmcia or the real
pcmcia package? The BP6 is my only non-laptop pcmcia.

his ass. If he lived in the middle ages he'd wear his codpiece backward.
