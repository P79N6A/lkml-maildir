[I've CC'd Andre Hedrick in because this is an IDE issue
Summary: my new hard drive locks up the system sometimes for 5-10 seconds 
during heavy I/O]
The drive is in DMA mode. The problem started a few weeks ago when a got a
new hard drive (Maxtor 13GB UDMA/33). For some reason, the kernel doesnt
turn on DMA automatically even though it is configured to, but I use
hdparm for it. If I run bonnie or do a similarly large i/o operation onto
/dev/hdc (the new maxtor drive), the machine freezes up randomly for a few
seconds at a time.

09
Jul 12 18:47:59 vitelus kernel: SIS5513: not 100% native mode: will probe
irqs later
So obviously the controller is a SIS5513.
I used this hard drive for a few days on another system with a VIA IDE
controller (from /proc/pci: IDE interface: VIA Technologies VT 82C586
Apollo IDE (rev 6)), in both UDMA and interrupt-driven mode, in both
2.0.36 and 2.2.9 but didn't experience any similarly huge lockups. Kernel
version on this machine is 2.2.10-tmw1 (the tmw patch should not affect
the IDE at all). I never experienced any of these lockups using the old
hard drive.
[root@vitelus aaronl]# hdparm /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 25249/16/63, sectors = 25450992, start = 0
Should I try enabling unmaskirq?
