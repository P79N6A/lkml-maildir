Hi
Withs kernel 2.6.11 ax25 t1_timeout is working badly...
Expl. I have set t1_timeout to 10s (10000).Now testing..
Taking radio of,set connection to somewhere,first try then
10s time second try...But then 20s and try next 30s and try...
So t1_timeout is increasing?In 2.6.10 timeout is 10 and
it does not increase...Possible bug?
