Try setting your shared RAM to 16K for now if possible, and see if
that improves things.  I've had reports of receiver congestion at 8K.
This may or may not have bearing on the problem.

That's a first.  In my 2.5 years of maintining the driver I've never
seen _that_ message.  In fact that error message isn't in the driver
code at all (ibmtr.[ch]).  I wonder what generates it.  Is this a
laptop?
