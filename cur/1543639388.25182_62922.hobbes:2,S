Hmm.. Giving them a quick glance-over, the /proc issues look like they
shouldn't be there in 2.5.x anyway, since the inode number really is
largely just a random number in 2.5 and all the real information is
squirelled away at path open time.
There's certainly a possibility for some cleanups, though.
