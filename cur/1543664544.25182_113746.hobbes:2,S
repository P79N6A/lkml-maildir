hey, in your previous email you claimed all we need is the patched CSSC,
you change topic quick! Glad you agree CSSC alone is useless and to make
anything useful with Rik's *notrademarkhere* tree we need a true
*notrademarkhere* exporter (of course the exporter will be backed by
CSSC to extract the single file changes, since they're in SCCS format
and it would be pointless to reinvent the wheel).
Now you say the bitbucket project (you read Pavel's announcement, he
said "read only for now", that means exporter in my vocabulary) is
useful, to me that sounds the opposite of your previous claims, but
again: glad we agree on this too now.
