Well, thank you for that offer in mind, but the git bisect is only necessary for some people needing to know what the reasons for the AMD K7 router Oopses are (speak: what needs to be inserted in vanilla mainline to make it "round" (2.6.21.3, 4, 5,.....)).
But meanwhile I got three perfect running machines, implying 
Trent's stuff, implying self-built stuff, and everything built up on 2.6.21-git4), so I can solve my problems on my own.
See, if it is almost impossible to build up necessary majorities to get rid of some utmost nasty gatekeepers @linuxtv.org then I can keep my own patch repositories and save lots of energy.
Why should I fight against windmills of such an enourmous stupidity like diagnosed around here? No reason for that!
Why should I take part in testing the mm-tree?
Nothing but waste of time, isn't it??
The technical issues that still need to be fixed plus some creative ideas I sent to mrechberger@gmail.com plus to Trent Piepho. If they get this done - excellent!
If not - why should I waste nerves?
Because of some stupid Abraham or Krufky??
Or the intransparence of Mr. Chehab's air bubbles??
Why should I??
