  Hi,
  I'm working on a project that require knowing the
max MTU size supported by the 3Com PCI 3c905C
(Boomerang).
  The datasheet provided by 3Com does not mention it,
and I already did the usual google search, but didn't
find it neither.
  Does anyone knows a "generic way" of knowing this
(or chip-specific)?
  Thanks in advance.
