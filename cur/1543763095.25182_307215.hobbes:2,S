OK, I'm declaring defeat here. I've been fighting race conditions all
day, and it's now 1 in the morning where I live. It looks like this
implementation has no other choice but to have the waking up "pending
owner" take the wait_list lock once again.  How heavy of a overhead is
that really?  
The problem I've painfully discovered, is that a task trying to take the
lock must test the pending owner for two things. One is, is the pending
owner owning the same lock as the one the task is trying to get. Since
the waking up of the pending owner has no synchronous locking, it can
grab the lock and then become a pending owner to another lock after the
other task thinks it's still the pending owner of the lock its trying to
get, but before testing it. So it can mistake it as the pending owner
still for this lock, when in reality it owns to lock and is pending for
another.
The other test must also do the test_and_clear_bit on the pending owner
bit. So you need to make sure the owner not only stays the owner of the
lock the task is trying to get, but also be able to do the atomic
test_and_clear on the owner's pending owner bit.
I can't get these two in sync without grabbing a lock (in this case, the
wait_list lock). 
Ingo, unless you can think of a way to do this, tomorrow (actually
today), I'll change this to have the end of __down (and friends) grab
the wait_list lock to test and clear it's pending owner bit.
