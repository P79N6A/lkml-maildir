You mean putting this kind of detection into setserial instead of
kernel? Well, that might work... We'll still need to create new
serial-chip type "hispeed" (because bank selection has to be done in
other way or chip failsback into compatibility mode). I just thought
that doing detection automatically on boot is nicer...
