there's not that many counters in fact. And if you care about a gige
counter, just bind the card to a specific CPU and you have ad-hoc per-cpu
counters...
The extra cost of getting to them (extra indirection) makes each access 
more expensive..... in the end it might be a loss.
There's several things where per cpu data is useful; low frequency
statistics is not one of them in my opinion.
