The NICs are all PCI-X devices and they report "64bit+" so they will be 
running on a PCI-X bus internally.

I believe so.

The "Multimedia video controller: DekTec Digital Video B.V. DTA-105" 
doesn't report PCI-X capabilities. And looking at the card on their web 
site, it does not have a 64-bit extension, so it doesn't support 64-bit.
