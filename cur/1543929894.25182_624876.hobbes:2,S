It isn't an inquiry - it's a plain old submit_bio() and it runs to
completion in the usual fashion.
Thing is, we wouldn't have called it at all if this queue was already over
its allocation limit.  IOW, we know that it's below its allocation limit,
so we know it won't deadlock.  Given, of course, reasonably pessimistc
error margins.
Which margins can even be observed at runtime: keep a running "max" of this
stack's most-ever memory consumption (for a single call), and only submit a
bio into it when its current allocation is less than (limit - that-max).

We already have that, I think: blk_run_backing_dev().  One could envisage a
similar thing which runs up and down the stack accumulating "how much
memory do you need for this request" data, but I think that would be hard to
implement and plain dumb.

I don't see any unviability.

Yeah, one would need to be pretty pessimal.  Perhaps unacceptably
inaccurate, dunno.

I don't think so.  If you're going to sleep in state TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
then you *have* to bale out and return to userspace (or whatever) when
signal_pending().  Because schedule() becomes a no-op.

Well..  See 
add-lock_page_killable.patch
kernel-add-mutex_lock_killable.patch
vfs-use-mutex_lock_killable-in-vfs_readdir.patch
in 2.6.24-rc4-mm1.
But for now, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE is the honest solution.
