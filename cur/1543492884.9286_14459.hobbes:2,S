I am a bit worried by rb_search... Such function is short enough to be put
inline for real...
So here it is a new patch:
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/kernel-patches/rbtree-search-inline-2.2.5_arca11.bz2
It's again against 2.2.5_arca11 and it replaces rbtree-2.2.5_arca11
completly. It would be also interesting to know if putting rb_search
inline make real differences (it was just a fastcall..).
Well if you are going to benchmark the rb-tree code probably is better
that you apply this little variation that will _only_ avoid an asm "call"
for every search.
