Of course it was and still is. New socket is allocated without incrementing 
modules ref count in sys_accept().

Oh, I see. And I just sent a patch without any explanation. Ok. 
(you might want to reread our original discussion again).

But you didn't tell me that. You just said that it's "an ugly hack" without
giving any other feedback.
->owner field in protocol ops did come up during discussion (I think Rusty brought 
that up) and I explained why it shouldn't be there. But again there was no feed back 
from you. You just ignored that thread at some point. 
btw I still don't see ->owner in protocol ops. I read archives of netdev. You guys 
didn't even talk about that.
Anyway it's not important who said what now. You chose to ignore stuff that I did, fine.
What about this though
