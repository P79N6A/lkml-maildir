What is that exactly? I got the problem that mppp is not working
correctly with 2.4.9 and 2.4.10-pre2 (and I tried some 2.4.9-ac too).
When I came to my router, I had the following lines on my console
isdn_ppp_mp_receive: lpq->ppp_slot -1
isdn_ppp_mp_receive: lpq->ppp_slot -1
isdn_ppp_mp_receive: lpq->ppp_slot -1
isdn_ppp_mp_receive: lpq->ppp_slot -1
isdn_ppp_xmit: lp->ppp_slot -1
And after these lines I had a kernel-oops on my console. After running
ksymoops I found out, that the kernel was doing something in the
sceduler (if I understand the output of ksymoops right). But these
crashes must be mppp-related, because if I never execute isdnctrl
addlink ippp0 the system never crashes and these error-messages never
appear.
