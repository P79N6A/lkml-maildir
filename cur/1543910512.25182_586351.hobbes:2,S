I think this is too radical of a change to be practical.  Instead, I
propose the following:
- "struct boot_params" (the zeropage) is kept as a legacy interface.
%esi will continue to point to it on entry to the 32-bit entrypoint
(presumably that is %rsi on entry to a 64-bit entrypoint?)
- We add a magic number and a pointer chain to the zeropage.  The
presence of the magic number indicates that:
	- Any unused fields in the zeropage is zero;
	- The pointer chain is valid (unless zero);
	- The old "HD info" fields (and possibly the EDD fields)
	  can be recycled.
What a post-upgrade kernel should do upon encountering an old structure
(sans magic) is to zero out any fields that wasn't present in the legacy
structure definition, including the pointer chain, then it can use it as-is.
We should avoid adding fields to the zero_page after that, unless
necessary for backwards compatibility reasons.  In general, new data
items should be added as pointer capabilities.
Compare this to the legacy PCI header vs. PCI capabilities.
