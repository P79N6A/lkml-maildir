Hi, My name is Anoop. I have a problem with the 2.6.0test5 kernel. It gives
me an error saying that the partitions are not aligned, when I try to print
the partition table, using fdisk. I have a Pheonix Bios and a 40GB HDD,
running on my laptop. I have already disabled the "Auto-resize geometry"
option in the kernel. I also have a problem with the Framebuffer during
bootup. It shows a horribly distorted screen if I try to boot with "vga=791"
option. "vga=normal" gives me no problem though. I had neither problems with
the 2.4.x kernels.Any ideas?
Thanks
Anoop
