Oh, yeah ?... Really ?... Please, read the errors before drawing hasted conclusions...
The errors occur after the mere #inclusion of Linux headers. Here is a simple "code"
which will trigger the error:
#ifndef __KERNEL__
#define __KERNEL__
#endif
#include <linux/module.h>
int main() {
	return 0;
}
And I don't see anything wrong in that code...

That's a pity... Non-regression should be guaranteed. The problem with Linux
is that each new version brings a load of incompatibilities with third parties
drivers (graphic cards, win/smart modems, wifi cards, etc, etc), most of which
using proprietary code which sources are unavailable to the end user. The fact
that Linux keeps breaking those drivers code is not going to encourage hardware
vendors to make Linux drivers for their products. For example, ATI takes a
couple of months to catchup with the kernel changes, and each time they release
a new driver the next Linux release breaks it. :-(
