It's just a example of a complex data structure that cannot easily be 
represented using the tagged-list form (I took it as an example because the 
first version of the devreg patch used tagged lists, too, and the complexity 
of representing this USB structure convinced me that tagged-lists are too 
limited). 
Whatever format is chosen for proc, it should be used for all data.
