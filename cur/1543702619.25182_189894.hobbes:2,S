Hi all,
Is there an easy way in Linux to enumerate all HID devices, other
than iterating /dev/usb/hiddev* ? E.g. in OS X, one accesses
a linked list of all HID devices to connect to one.
Also, is there a different way to access these devices than through
the device node? The problem is that the assignment of node to
device is not at all static and makes it difficult to work with.
Pointers, hints, tipps, tricks, and friendly flames (e.g. RTFM) are
greatly appreciated.

invalid/expired pgp subkeys? use subkeys.pgp.net as keyserver!
 
you can't assign IP address 127.0.0.1 to the loopback adapter,
because it is a reserved address for loopback devices.
