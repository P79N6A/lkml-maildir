indeed, you are right.

the only thing i'd suggest to change is to also generate an RT (and 
perhaps PK) result with all debugging options disabled - i.e. both 
RT_DEADLOCK_DETECT and all LATENCY_TRACING/timing related options 
disabled.
but your tests did trigger asserts not so long ago so it might not be
wise to run without debugging. But it's definitely a thing to try in the
future.

no, i think the PK kernel is supposed to be quite close to what
2.4+lowlat offers.
