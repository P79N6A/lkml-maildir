Subject: [PATCH 0/16] C99: 2.6.0-t3-bk7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/8/20/21

Ok. To follow are 16 patches, broken down by directory that fix up
struct definitions to follow the C99 style. I believe I got all of
them. 
The emails will just contain the patch in the body with nothing else.
I don't think I need to say the same thing over and over at the
beginning of each patch. :)
Also, the patches are against 2.6.0-test3-bk7. They will not apply
cleanly to any earlier version so don't bother unless you plan to
edit. You'll also miss out on some of the C99 cleanups that happened
in bk1-7 that are no longer in my patches.
Finally, I hope the subject meets approval by one and all. ;)
Here we go...
