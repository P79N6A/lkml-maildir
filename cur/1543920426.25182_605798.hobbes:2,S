The only obvious thing I can think of to try would be to read the MAC
address both ways around.
The first 3 bytes of the resulting MAC should always be the Nvidia
allocation as I understand it and if so you can then decide which way
around is correct. 
ie if it starts 00:04:0B then you know which way around it goes. (there
is one address that is the same either way around but clearly that one
doesn't matter).
So perhaps do that and for the afflicted parts add an EITHER_WAY_AROUND
flag ?
