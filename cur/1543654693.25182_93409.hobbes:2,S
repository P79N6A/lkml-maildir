But we've already called fsync_super() at this point.  If that completes
synchronously, then the buffers will already be out of the journal and
queued for writeback when we get here, and clearing BH_JBDDirty won't
have any dire consequences.
Indeed, loading the ext3 module with "do_sync_supers=1" cures the
symptoms.
However, doing every superblock write synchronously is a non-starter, as
that requires a journal commit in the ext3 universe, and so this would
essentially force bdflush to serialise all of its filesystem flushes
(which is a real problem once you've got a significant number of
filesystems mounted.)  But the VFS simply doesn't have any clean way of
telling foo_write_super() whether the call needs to be completed
synchronously or asynchronously.
There *is* a totally unclean way, though.  kill_super() sets sb->s_root
to NULL before calling its final fsync_super(), and ext3 can easily
check that in ext3_write_super().  It's a nasty, messy dependency, but
should work for 2.4 at least.  For 2.5 we probably want to look at
passing an async flag down into the write_super.
The attached patch seems to fix things for me.
Cheers,
 Stephen
