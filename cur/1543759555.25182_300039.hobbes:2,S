puligny:~% cat /proc/acpi/sleep
S0 S1 S3 S4 S4bios S5
Where am I suppose to see a difference between S4 and S4Bios here ?
 From what I see in acpi_system_write_sleep in drivers/acpi/sleep/proc.c
4 uses software_suspend while 4b uses acpi_suspend(4)
(SOFTWARE_SUSPEND is set in my .config)
Is this code the right one ?
         /* Check for S4 bios request */
         if (!strcmp(str,"4b")) {
                 error = acpi_suspend(4);
                 goto Done;
         }
         state = simple_strtoul(str, NULL, 0);
#ifdef CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
         if (state == 4) {
                 error = software_suspend();
                 goto Done;
         }
#endif
         error = acpi_suspend(state);

Ok, great! I'll be happy to test it soon :)
