That's right.  The only time I ever saw Linus express an opinion on
this was in a post on lkml in which he said he didn't like the big
monolithic help file.  It didn't seem especially directed to me; I am
not the CML1 maintainer.
But I took it as a suggestion for CML2.  I told him I was willing to
do it after CML2 cutover, but was not sure he had considered the
ramifications for maintaining rulebase translations.  To this request
for clarification and guidance, I received no reply.
