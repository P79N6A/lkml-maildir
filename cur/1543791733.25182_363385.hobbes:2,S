Subject: [PATCH 6/5] cpuset: rebind numa vma mempolicy fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/4/47

The patch:
  [PATCH 2/5] cpuset: rebind numa vma mempolicy
requires this fix to avoid a deadlock situation
in certain cpuset removal cases.
It's ok to not complete the refresh_mems() operation
if we notice we are already holding mmap_sem.  We
will try again, next time we allocate memory.

 (This fix was included in my testing, but in another
  patch that has not been sent in yet.)
