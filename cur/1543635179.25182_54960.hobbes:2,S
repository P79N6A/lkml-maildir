The most correct would be to lock the struct file in any way so it can't 
be used while I eat it. But I guess that's efficient locking vs. space, 
isn't it? What would happen if we had a locking field on every struct?!

We should rename it to something that actually tells you what it does. 
BTW, when was lock_kernel()? It must be really old if it still locked the 
whole kernel.
