This changes an O(1) process to O(N), where N is the size of the
directory. That's one of the issues with dnotify that they're trying to
fix.
Bottom line, the kernel has that information available to it, and
cheaply. Forcing userspace to rederive that information for the
advantage of not spewing filenames out of the kernel is a false economy,
when viewed from the entire system.
