Please don't misunderstand.  I'm not saing that 2.6 is fine,
only that there is a way to automatically restart a sshd accidentally 
killed by the OOM killer.  This could probably save you some of those
trips, if you keep experimenting with 2.6.

Fork failing is another issue than a killed sshd.  It is usually fixed
by using ulimit so a buggy process simply cant fork off way too
many children. (Or use up too much memory.)

Quite possible, but be aware that these things can happen with 2.4 too.
It is possible to get 2.4 into a shortage where fork fails,
you should use ulimit anyway to avoid that.  Also, having
a sshd that is restarted by "init" is a good idea anyway
on such a remote machine.  2.4 might not kill sshd by kernel bug, but
who knows what some future exploit or future bug could do.

I too want a well-behaved OOM killer.  Workarounds are available though,
until this happens.
