hello,
I'm trying to mount root filesystem on cramfs (2.6.11,
compiled with mtd and CRAMFS support), however I get
following well known error message:
VFS: Cannot open root device "mtdblock1" or
unknown-block(31,1)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root
fs on unknown-block(31,1)
I've found, that funtion "path_lookup" with "/root" 
fails with (-2) when called from
mount_block_root--do_mount_root -- sys_mount(name,
"/root", fs, flags, data);
Could this be a problem with initramfs??? Do I need
initramfs every time to mount later a real root fs?
best regards 
Pawel
