Sam, what we observe is the situation, when Linux cpu scheduler spreads 
2 tasks on 1st CPU and 1 task on the 2nd CPU. Std linux scheduler 
doesn't do any rebalancing after that, so no plays with tokens make the 
spread to be 3:2:1, since the lowest priority process gets a full 2nd 
CPU (100% instead of 33% of CPU).
Where is my mistake? Can you provide a configuration where we could test 
or the instuctions on how to avoid this?
Thanks,
Kirill
