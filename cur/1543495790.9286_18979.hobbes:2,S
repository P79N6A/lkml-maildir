I can't believe I'm seeing this on linux-kernel!! This is very juvenile way
of reacting and I'm seriously concerned. If some of the people developing
Linux are stupid enough to react like this then what about their code?
I would expect this from Microsoft, but not here. If it's so bad then just
tell them for Christ's sake! You don't hit them on their heads!
