By its subsystem value (block), from the symlink, from the environment,
or from $1.

$SUBSYSTEM == "block"

/sys/block is still there and contains symlinks. And all this happens
only for !SYSFS_DEPRECATED.

Unification. Block devices are "struct devices", use a class, use the
common driver core code instead of their own, show up in the tree, and
can be parents for other devices.
