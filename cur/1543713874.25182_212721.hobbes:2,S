Sorry. I live in the real world. In 1999 I had servers
to protect. One of them was hacked and I started to
look for tools which could protect servers. I found
NOTHING. (there were some Intrusion Detection Systems,
which would alert you when your server was ALREADY
hacked - it was completely unacceptable for me).
So I created VXE. Problem was solved. I could not sit
and think about some perfect design while my servers
were in the net unprotected, it's too expensive.
Speed is not most important for me. If I have fast but
unprotected server - it is of no use for me.

VXE worked for me. It was much better than nothing.

Actually one 'dynamic' feature is implemented in VXE.
In ordinary system resource has permissions which
allows access or not. For higher security VXE can
count number of allowed accesses. For example, we are
securing POP server. We allow it to open /etc/passwd,
/etc/shadow for reading only once (counter is 1). So,
if hacker breaks to POP server after it opened
/etc/passwd - there is no way hacker can open this
file.
Another 'dynamic' feature is changing policy on the
fly. For now POP server can access all mailboxes in
/var/spool/mail - it's easy to add ability to modify
policy. After POP server authorized user it changes
it's UID - at that point we can set access to
/var/spool/mail/user_1 only. So POPD couldn't access
other files in all mailbox directories.

VXE can have counters assigned to syscall parameters.
More sophisticated way is to have determined sequence
of syscalls. So, if hackers broke in the system
(sendmail for example) he can just follow logic of the
system - do the work of sendmail for you :-)
I can't say how easy to use this, but the company (my
competitors :-) which created this is entercept.com -
it seems, that they were very successful - I went to
their site right now and was redirected to Network
Associates - they were bought out, my guess.
