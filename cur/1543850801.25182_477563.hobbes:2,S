I had trouble understanding what you are saying here.
What does the phrase "live as long as user want" mean?

So you would add bloat to the kernel, with two interfaces
to the same facility, because you don't want the resource
controller to depend on configfs.
I am familiar with what is wrong with kernel bloat.
Can you explain to me what is wrong with having resource
groups depend on configfs?  Is there something wrong with
configfs that would be a significant problem for some systems
needing resource groups?
It is better where possible, I would think, to reuse common
infrastructure and minimize redundancy.  If there is something
wrong with configfs that makes this a problem, perhaps we
should fix that.
