Curious: VM_SHM wasn't set on a System V IPC shm vma in any 2.4 or 2.6
kernel that I know of; but was set on the vmas of a random collection
of drivers.  Perhaps you've been using your own patch to set it on
SysV IPC shm vmas, and clear it from drivers' vmas?
(We'll remove VM_SHM entirely once I've trawled through those drivers.)

Nothing easy and reliable springs immediately to mind - from a VM point
of view, they're treated much the same as tmpfs files; but there
probably is some hacky way if we think about it long enough.

It seems that either you've been doing the wrong thing up to now,
and never noticed it; or that you've been using your own flag in
your own patch, and can continue to do so.  No need for vanilla
kernel to reinstate VM_SHM.
Are you sure you need to recognize them?
