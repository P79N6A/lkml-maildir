Common misconception. I wrote 2.4-ac, not 2.4 vanilla tre. 2.4-ac is in
flux, 2.5 is too. There are some quirks, most of the 'doesnt work'
nature and not the 'corrupting data' kind.

But they come up?

Ok this is a new one, at least to me

Probably not ide, no important changes in there in between 2.6.36 and
present.

If you (or anyone else for that matter) come across ide oddities in 2.5,
please try 2.4.20-pre-ac kernels and see if you can reproduce.
