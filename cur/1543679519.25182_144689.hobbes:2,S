I agree this is a good thing.

I don't agree. This whole discussion revolves around getting BIO code and
IOMMU code to agree on how block merging works for a given platform.
Using a callback into IOMMU code means the BIO truly doesn't have to know.
The platform specific IOMMU could just tell BIO code what it wants to
know (how many SG entries would fit into a limited number of physical
mappings).

yes, sort of. But I think this entanglement is present even for machines
that don't have an IOMMU because of bounce buffers.  But if ia64's swiotlb
would be made generic to cover buffer bouncing....

Would that be Jens Axboe/Dave Miller/et al?
