alpha:
kernel/built-in.o: In function `posix_get_monotonic_raw':
: undefined reference to `getrawmonotonic'
kernel/built-in.o: In function `posix_get_monotonic_raw':
: undefined reference to `getrawmonotonic'
presumably busted for all CONFIG_GENERIC_TIME=n architectures.
Couldn't see a quick fix so I dropped it.
