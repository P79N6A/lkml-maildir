I haven't seriously used a VAX for about 12 years (see, life isn't all bad) and my
memory may be blurred. I seem to remember the MOP facility worked with the remote
diagnostics board installed. They had their own little micro, and everything in
firmware. If the VAX processor crashed the remote diagnostic board could still
access all the memory and dump its contents somewhere. Naturally this was a robust
solution. It isn't really a solution for Linux, however. Many times a crash will
occur with the protocol stack and NIC driver intact, so there may have a good
chance of dumping from Linux itself. It isn't very clean, though.
In another message someone suggested investigating the use of the soft reset
feature in the PC BIOS from the 286 days. I'm not sure if this is still available
in modern BIOSes. Even if it is, I don't see how it would help without something
reliable in ROM you can point at and run. There isn't any totally reliable code in
RAM that you could point to.
I wondered about using the boot ROM socket in the NIC to house an incorruptible
NIC driver, UDP, and tftp dump facility - not much different to the more usual use
for a tftp boot load facility. If the 286 reset trick does work with modern
machines perhaps a combination of these two would provide a reliable dump feature.
