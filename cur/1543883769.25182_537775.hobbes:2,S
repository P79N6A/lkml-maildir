I would ask Linus and the list maintainers to stop
the main thread.
When Linus posts a release, then I expect
that threads pertain to this release and not
start some sort of flame war.
If I have a problem with 2.6.21 (or any 2.x.x), I do
not expect to have to go through 100+ mails to
see if a problem has been reported.
Absolute misuse of reply-to.
