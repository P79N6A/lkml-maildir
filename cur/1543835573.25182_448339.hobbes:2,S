AFAIU, the scsi_eh (error handler) already has proper code for exactly 
this purpose, but the code is inactive. Any driver (SCSI low-level 
driver or SCSI command set driver) can activate it by setting 
scsi_device->allow_restart = 1.
Brian King posted a patch which lets you enable that flag at runtime:
"scsi: Add allow_restart sysfs class attribute", 2006-06-27

The patch is in Linus' tree now.
