Have you checked to make sure that the child threads are either detached
or pthread_join()'ed?  I remember running into a similar bug, except it was
that only 1024 threads would be created and the server would stop processing
requests.  It turned out that pthreads wouldn't clone any more threads
because 1024 zombie threads were taking up all of the thread slots that
pthreads uses to do joins.  When I made the threads start detached, the
server could answer more requests easily (although the server would have
one thread per client -- and one client would issue many requests -- so we
had many more threads than sockets).
