Sounds quite likely.
You should check objdump -d output of cyrix.o to verify whether the compiler
"illegally" reorders some I/O instructions in geode_configure().
Probably you need to add a barrier() or wmb() or similar to these macros.
Or should this be a (code-invisible) PCI posting issue? In that case you need
to add some dummy read operations.
Also, it would probably be good to convert these macros into inline functions
in this header.
