Doesn't __get_free_pages give me physically linear memory, which while
nice it isn't essential for what I need, so if I can't get my full
allocation I could in theory just start to fallback down the orders
and calling it multiple times to actually get the amount of memory I
need, this just seems overly cumbersome when what I really want is
vmalloc_32 to just work correctly on 64-bit systems... (why doesn't
vmalloc_32 pass __GFP_DMA32 to the allocator????)

Yes I want __GFP_DMA32 but I'd like it with vmalloc not with
__get_free_pages and I've no great need for physically linear page
allocations and as I'm after quite a large order I can see this
failing ... granted with a 4GB system maybe not that quickly..
