Please retract that claim.  I have said no such thing, and have
avoided saying anything that I thought might be misconstrued in that
direction.
To be absolutely clear: My complaints with Tivo as a hardware or BIOS
vendor are moral and pragmatic, not legal.  My complaint with Tivo as
a distributor of Linux is what hinges on legal issues.

Not legally relevant.

What they connect to is also not relevant.  That imples that because a
vendor has been issued or licensed patents, they are not obliged to
follow the GPL -- that the vendor has other obligations that supercede
the GPL's license claims.  GPL section 7 addresses that situation.
