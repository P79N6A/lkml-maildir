Yes, it reminds me of Ingo's first approach to pi locking:
Everything is done under a global spin lock. In Ingo's approach it was the
pi_lock. In turnstiles it is sched_lock, which (without looking at other
code in FreeBSD) locks the whole scheduler.
Although making the code a lot simpler, scalability is ofcourse the main
issue here. But apparently FreeBSD does have a global lock protecting the
scheduler anyway.
Otherwise it looks a lot like the rt_mutex.
