I'm quite a new linux user and system administrator (my own!) and I
encountered the following problems:
1) As the system starts up and the mixer settings are loaded, modprobe
complains that 'sound-slot-0' and 'sound-service-0-0' modules are not
present (in my kernel/drivers/sound directory I got just ac97_codec.o,
emu10k1, sound.o and soundcore.o). I've got a Sound Blaster Live! 5.1, a
'2.4.16-pre1' kernel and kmod usually works good, failing only with sound
(both with 'gom' mixer and with 'mpg123' player), so I have to 'modprobe
emu10k1' manually.
2) I tried for the first time to play a bit with kernel source and I was
trying to lower console_loglevel in order to have all the startup printk's
disappear. I lowered the DEFAULT_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL constant in
'kernel/printk.c' from '7' to '5' (just to be sure) but that wasn't enough
to get rid of all those annoying KERN_INFO. Why didn't it work?
Please feel free not to answer if you don't feel like. I know I can be buggy
sometimes! :P
Thank you!
