I think it goes something like this:
fork:
  detach page tables from parent
  retain pointer to "backing page tables" in parent and child
  update use count in page tables
  "prefault" tables for current stack and instruction pages in both parent
    and child
page fault:
  if faulted on page table:
    look up backing page tables
    if use count > 1: copy, dec use count
    else: take ownership

I'm pretty sure something like the above does signficantly less work in
the fork/exec case, which is the important one.
