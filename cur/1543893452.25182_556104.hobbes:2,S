OK, here are a couple of snapshots from "top" on a two-way system.
It seems to cycle back and forth between these two states.

The "preferred" state is the first one.  But given that the readers
will consume all CPU available to them, the scheduler might not be
able to tell the difference.
Perhaps the fakewriters are confusing the scheduler, will try again on
a 4-CPU machine leaving them out.
