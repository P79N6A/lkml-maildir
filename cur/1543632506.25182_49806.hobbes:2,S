Could be the case, so until I find another description I will
still not know how RAID-6 works.

Well, I'm not a hardware vendor. I just happen to have tried
doing it in software, and I wasn't able to do it efficiently.

I guess RAID-6 can be done efficiently in software. It is the
other encodings I'm worried about.
