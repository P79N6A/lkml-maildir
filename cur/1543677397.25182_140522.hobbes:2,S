Since getting my new laptop (Sony PCG-Z1SP, it's a Centrino machine) I had 
never got it to successfully power off. I had just been using the SuSE kernel 
and then the same configuration that worked well on a couple of other 
machines, but I then tried a different configuration and it powered off, 
after I did a little playing I tracked it down to the "Local APIC support on 
uniprocessors" option. Turning this off makes the machine poweroff. 
I have checked this on 2.4.21-rc6-ac1 and 2.4.21-ac1. I just thought other 
people might find that useful to know. 
The text on the help for CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC seems to suggest it's fine to use 
it on any machine (and certainly while running it seems to make no 
difference), would a patch to the text to indicate it may prevent power off 
be accepted, or is this problem too specific to this machine to be included?
Regards,
Edward

   If you have a system with several CPUs, you do not need to say Y
