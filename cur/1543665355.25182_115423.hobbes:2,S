klibc is losing at least some potential developers by virtue of its
licence.  I'm not willing to release code under the BSD licence and would
prefer full GPL.  I'm willing to compromise on LGPL, but Peter isn't.
He came out with some nonsense about wanting proprietary apps in early
userspace (which seems like a ludicrous thing to _favour_, but...) which
LGPL doesn't prevent you from doing, even with a non-shared library.
