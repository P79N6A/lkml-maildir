FWIW, I've had this problem from time to time on my Compaq Presario
x1010us laptop (which also uses the ICH-4 chipset) with several kernel
versions between 2.6.7 and 2.6.12, and I have _not_ been running the
RT patches (though I plan to start soon).
It seems to only happen when the laptop has been running for a while.
Also, X has been running each time. When it occurs, the stuck key
events follow the mouse focus from window to window, and in the few
cases where I'm able to either switch out of X to a different VT or
kill X, the keyboard is still "wedged" -- if I recall correctly,
switching VTs results in no keyboard events reaching that VT (as if X
is still consuming them). Can't remember what happens when I've
successfully killed X.
Again, happens uncommonly enough that I haven't put much effort into
debugging it.
Anyway, unless it's a similar but unlrelated bug, it's not _caused_ by RT.
