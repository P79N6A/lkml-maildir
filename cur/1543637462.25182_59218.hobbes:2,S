Start with getting the errata kernel, see if that helps. I don't think
it will make a difference but lets be sure. Also check the box with
memtest86. 2.4 does stress hardware way harder than 2.2, especially if
the box is an AMD Athlon
If that doesn't help do also file an entry in

It may be a problem with the Red Hat patches not the base kernel so it
is useful for us to be able to track it too.
