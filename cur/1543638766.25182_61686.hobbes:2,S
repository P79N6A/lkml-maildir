Netscape failes to start with no log messages and screen output:
"XIO:  fatal IO error 22 (Invalid argument) on X server ":0.0"
      after 117 requests (116 known processed) with 1 events remaining."
Mozilla works.
I have found nothing else affected, but I only ran it for one afternoon 
and evening (~6 hours).
2.4.18pre8-vm35 works well and I'm returning to it.
