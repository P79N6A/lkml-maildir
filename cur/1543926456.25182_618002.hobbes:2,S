Hi Gary,
[I'm gonna take the points in your mail a little out of order]

Of course, you are right. I am not sure what I was thinking when
I wrote that email yesterday, but I pretty much got it exactly
wrong. I think I confused myself between empty/populated vs
hp/non-hp. In any case, thanks for the patient explanation.
I went back and looked at a vanilla kernel on my machine that has
the following hardware configuration:
HP rx6600
Slot 1-2: PCI-X under PCI root bridges
Slot 3-6: PCIe under transparent P2P bridges
Slot 7-10: PCI-X under PCI root bridges
Slot 1: PCI-X,  !populated, !hp
Slot 2: PCI-X,  populated, !hp
Slot 3: PCIe,   populated, hp
Slot 4: PCIe,   populated, hp
Slot 5: PCIe,   !populated, hp
Slot 6: PCIe,   populated, hp
Slot 7: PCI-X,  !populated, hp
Slot 8: PCI-X,  !populated, hp
Slot 9: PCI-X,  !populated, hp
Slot 10: PCI-X, !populated, hp
On a kernel without my changes, we see:
[root@canola slots]# modprobe acpiphp
[root@canola slots]# ls
10  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
[root@canola slots]# for i in * ; do ls $i ; done
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
[root@canola slots]# for i in * ; do cat $i/address ; done
0000:01:02
0000:8b:00
0000:52:00
0000:c5:00
0000:10:00
0000:0a:01
0000:4a:01
0000:01:01
This confirms that you were right -- we see all the hp slots show
up, even though many of them are non-populated. Also, the correct
hp entries show up, just like you'd expect.
Ok, so all that said, after re-implementing my ACPI-PCI slot
driver, we get all the correct answers, but with the additional
appearance of slots 1 and 2 (which aren't hotpluggable):
[root@canola slots]# ls
1  10  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
[root@canola slots]# for i in * ; do ls $i ; done
address
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
address
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
adapter  address  attention  latch  power
[root@canola slots]# for i in * ; do cat $i/address ; done
0000:49:01
0000:01:02
0000:49:02
0000:8b:00
0000:52:00
0000:c5:00
0000:10:00
0000:0a:01
0000:4a:01
0000:01:01
Bonus points because all that noise during boot went away too.
Life is much better when you actually copy an algorithm correctly
rather than coming up with some half-assed solution on one's own.
;)
So if you could try out v2 of my patch series when you get access
to your machine back, I'd much appreciate it. I feel a lot better
about it compared to v1.

I will work on this for v3.
Thanks!
