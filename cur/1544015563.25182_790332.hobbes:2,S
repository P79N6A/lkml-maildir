I have also an ASUS MCP55 board, a KFN5-D.
To save the crash I reported in the "[git pull] x86 fixes" thread, I
had to boot the patch -rc1 a second time.
After saving the Oops on my second pc I rebooted my test system (the
one with the MCP55) into 2.6.28 and the boot process hung as it wanted
to mount its NFS filesystems. Trying to connect from the second system
failed, not even a ping reply.
But: Just removing the ethernet cable and immediately reconnecting it
seemed to have kicked my MCP55 ethernet port back in working order.
No fishy things in the syslog...
