	We *don't* do *everything* in userland.  We just allow access to
the raw side of the world from userland so that a program doesn't have
to do worse things to try and get the same access.  The way it currently
is there is the possibility that a vendor wouldn't have to muck around
in the kernel to be able to upgrade the flash.
	This keeps the vendor specific *junk* out of the kernel and in
userland.  The kernel provides a nice clean interface to devices which
conform to the spec.  Note that such raw access is, from what I can tell,
part of the spec, just the specific data sent using it isn't specified
in the spec and has been used by vendors to provide vendor-specific hooks,
which reminds me of 'SCSI generic'...
