Xattrs and acls are not supported, this is a todo.
Filesize limits are in theory 2^64.  In practice about 2 TiB.
No limits on the entries per directory.

Xattrs and ACLs.
The above information has been added to a squashfs.txt file.

Done and fixed.

Vmalloc was used to allocate block data (128 Kib by default).
I've removed all vmallocs from Squashfs.  All buffers are now kmalloced 
in PAGE_CACHE_SIZEd chunks.

The cache is not used for file datablocks, these are decompressed and 
cached in the page-cache in the normal way.  The cache is only used to 
temporarily cache fragment and metadata blocks which have been read as 
as a result of a metadata (i.e. inode or directory) or fragment access. 
  Because metadata and fragments are packed together into blocks (to 
gain greater compression) the read of a particular piece of metadata or 
fragment will retrieve other metadata/fragments which have been packed 
with it, these because of locality-of-reference may be read in the near 
future. Temporarily caching them ensures they are available for near 
future access without requiring an additional read and decompress.
The cache is deliberately kept small to only cache the last couple of 
blocks read.  The total overhead is 3 x block_size (128 KiB) for 
fragments and 8 x 8 KiB for metadata blocks, or a total of 448 KiB.
If you think this is too large I can reduce the number of fragments and 
metadata blocks cached.
Because these blocks are greater than PAGE_CACHE_SIZE is not easy to use 
the page cache.  As Joern said "there really isn't any infrastructure to 
deal with such cases yet.  Bufferheads deal with blocks smaller than a 
page, not the other way around."  Storing these in the page cache 
introduces a lot more complexity in terms of locking and associated race 
conditions.
As previously mentioned I have rewritten the cache implementation to 
avoid vmalloc and to use PAGE_CACHE_SIZE blocks.  This eliminates the 
vmalloc fragment issues, and is a first step in moving the 
implementation over to using the page cache in the future.

Added to a new squashfs.txt file.

Ok.  I'll re-spin the patches against 2.6.28 tomorrow (Sunday), and I'll 
prepare a tree for linux-next.
