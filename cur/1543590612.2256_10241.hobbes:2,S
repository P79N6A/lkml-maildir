"when possible", we've made no such total souce level
compat. guarentee.  And more such changes are coming, for example the
quota bugs can't be fixed without breaking source level compat. for
the filesystems.
You may think and argue otherwise, but our ability to break source
level compatibility is one of our strengths (see solaris rsh root
owned socket bug of yesteryear for one example as to why).
