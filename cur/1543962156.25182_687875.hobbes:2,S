Personally, I think that's a bit messy.  People might start getting
-EROFS when they never, ever *HAD* a r/o FS.  They may have made a
request for one, but they never actually hard one.
I also understand what you're saying.  If we were able to loosen up some
of the requirements it would certainly make the patches simpler.  How
does everyone else feel about this?
