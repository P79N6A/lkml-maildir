The infamous LINK_FIRST infrastructure was sort of half-way done.
It would be best to cause drivers with an unspecified link order
to move around a bit, so that errors may be discovered more quickly.
LINK_FIRST is pretty coarse. One would want a topological sort,
or at least LINK_0 through LINK_9 _without_ anything else.
