You didn't think any of the criticisms of higher order page cache size

With iommus and sg lists?
You guys have a couple of problems, firstly you need to have ia64
filesystems accessable to x86_64. And secondly you have these controllers
without enough sg entries for nice sized IOs.
I sympathise, and higher order pagecache might solve these in a way, but
I don't think it is the right way to go, mainly because of the fragmentation
issues.
Increasing PAGE_SIZE, support for block size > page cache size, and getting
io controllers matched to a 4K page size IMO would be some good ways to
solve these problems. I know they are probably harder...
