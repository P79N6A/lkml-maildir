The problem is (as I understand it) that drivers/pcmcia/cardbus.c ends up
not allocating the onboard ROM resource for some cards before trying to
enable it.  I've attached a patch that worked for me on 2.5.52, although
said patch caused a lot of discussion here about the *right* way to do it
(even *I* admit it's a hack) - and I've seen a report it causes an OOPS
on 2.5.53.  I've not tried it on post-52, but I had a -54 kernel OOPS
right around that point in bootup (right after IDE and somewhere in PCI
init).  Haven't chased that one at all...
