You can cut these down a lot
mount the ext2fs with the check=none option
The second cool approach is a bit naughty but works rather well. Apply
the software suspend patch, boot the machine to steady state, suspend it
with only a small swap partition then copy that partition 
into another partition or file
On shutdown you dd the partition back after you swapoff.
Your reboot then finds the hardware, sets it up, finds the magic partition
and springs back into the position it suspended from
