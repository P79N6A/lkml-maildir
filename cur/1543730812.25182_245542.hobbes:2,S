  Yes,  for  example  documents,  image  files  etc. The multiple data
  streams  can  contain thumbnails, info about who is editing the file
  (useful for networked files) etc. Could be used for version handling
  and much more.
  Also, just because we do not see all the benefits right now, doesn't
  mean there won't be any.
