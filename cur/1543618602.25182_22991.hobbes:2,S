Hi Maneesh!
	Fantastic work!  A couple of questions, and a trivial patch:
 o Would DCACHE_DEFERRED_FREE be better called DCACHE_UNLINKED?  If I
   understand correctly, it's only and always set when someone has deleted
   (unhashed) the dentry.
 o Am I correct in asserting that you could change all the
   "list_empty(dentry->dhash)" tests to
   "dentry->d_vfs_flags & DCACHE_DEFERRED_FREE" tests, and hence change the
   list_del_init() to list_del() in unhash, and thus remove the d_nexthash
   field altogether?
 o d_lookup looks like it can return an DCACHE_DEFERRED_FREE dentry: this
   seems wrong: shouldn't it loop here?
 o Were you planning on changing d_count to a non-atomic?  It seems overkill
   to have it protected by the lock, but ALSO atomic for other places.
   Could be a performance loss as well.
 o Minor nitpick: unhash() in dcache.h is plainer implemented in terms of
   __unhash().
Any chance of you making it to 
http://linux.conf.au
 next month BTW?
Thanks for the cool patch!
Rusty.
