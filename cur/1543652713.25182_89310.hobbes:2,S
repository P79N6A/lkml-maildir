I've updated my patchset for the stable kernel.
It includes 
O(1) Batch scheduler
Preemptible
Low Latency
AA VM addons
Compressed caching VM
Optional RMAP14c VM
ALSA
Supermount
XFS
ACPI
Changes to this release:
Andrea Arcangeli's fix for "processes stuck in D" has been put in. It was a 
serious recurring problem with my patchset. It seemed to be responsible for 
the pausing seen by a few. Compressed caching now works fine with the aa vm 
addons as well so they are merged. Minor changes to cc should make it safer 
for ext3 but I dont guarantee it so only try it on experimental boxes. XFS 
has been updated to the 1.2pre3 release. Rmap has been updated to 14c. A full 
split out patchset is also available. 
Check it out here:

Cheers,
Con
