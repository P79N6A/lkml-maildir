My 486 has neither PCI nor USB, the disk is attached to a
plain ancient IDE port.

If it is, I don't think it's ARM-specific. The last two years
I've done a lot of work with 2.6 kernels on a DS101 ARM box.
It's similar to the NSLU2 except it has 64MB of RAM and a built-in
PCI PATA controller. I've stressed it quite a bit, but never
seen the OOM killer trigger on it.
So you using USB storage might be relevant.
