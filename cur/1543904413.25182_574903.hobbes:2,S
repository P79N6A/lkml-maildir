I am often confused.  Confusion is my natural state.  It's how I got started 
writing documentation, as "notes to me" so I'd be able to reproduce what I 
did.
Currently my "one more thing to research before I can write this up" is your 
earlier comment that I can coldplug the existing set of devices without 
talking to sysfs.  Possibly there's a way to do this through netlink, but I 
don't know of any way to send data _back_ to the kernel with the usermode 
helper mechanism, and telling the kernel to do that for every device in the 
system at once seems like a fork bomb waiting to happen anyway.
Yes, some embedded developers want to remove the networking layer from the 
kernel, meaning they can't use netlink, meaning if we ever _do_ go to 
dynamically allocated /dev nodes and you _must_ populate /dev by getting the 
numbers out of the kernel, this is an issue.
So far, I've been able to devote about 15 minutes to this topic since the 
weekend, and that was stolen from something else...
