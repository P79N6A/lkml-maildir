Dear Colleagues
I had some problems using float values into the system calls.
Is there some constraints with floats in the kernel ??
I mean ... I could not return a float value from a system call that I built. 
In fact ... I had a float field in the process table and
I created two system calls: one to update and the other to return the modified value. And I got wrong results in that
procedure.
I got right answers only changing the field and the return of the system calls to integers.
I am looking forward to your answer.
Best regards,
Livia Catarina.
