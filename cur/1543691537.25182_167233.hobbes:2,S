	Hmm... with test4-bk2 I have on the average twice as many frame errors
as I do packets being sent it seems... The test5-bk[135] I've tried
won't even associate with the APs... I would think it was a problem with
the AP but it's two different AP units (brands and models) as well it
worked fine with the older 2.4.20 kernel...
