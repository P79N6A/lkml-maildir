With the current behaviour an app has to link against libcap and do:
prtctl(PR_SET_KEEPCAPS, 1)
pre_caps = (capgetp(0, cap_init())  // save our caps into a struct
setuid(uid)  
setgid(gid)
capsetp(0,pre_caps)  // Restore them
With this patch, the app does:
prtctl(PR_SET_KEEPCAPS, 1)
setuid(uid)
setgid(gid)
The end result is exactly the same.  I'm trying to envision how this patch
would change security in a negative way.  I keep coming back to the Unix
idea of "don't be smarter than the admin; don't try to protect root from
himself". 
Maybe we could enchance PR_SET_KEEPCAPS so that:
prtctl(PR_SET_KEEPCAPS, 2) kept both the permitted and the effective caps.
