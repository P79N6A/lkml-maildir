BTW, the behaviour is that all files appear to be locked.  In vi, for
example, when I try to edit the file 'test' below, it says:
"test" [FILE BEING MODIFIED BY ANOTHER PROCESS] 1 line, 31 characters
on tru64 alpha:
% ls -al
total 12
drwxrwx---   2 root     kmw         4096 Dec 22 20:22 .
drwxr-xr-x   6 root     system      4096 Dec 22 08:22 ..
-rw-rw-r--   1 root     kmw           31 Dec 22 21:27 test
% groups
accntmgr kmw ...
Best.
