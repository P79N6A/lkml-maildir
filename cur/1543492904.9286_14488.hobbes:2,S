My i586 isn't: dip(8) crashes when setting up the CSLIP connection if
compiled with later snapshots (I'm compiling my compilers with -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -march=pentium (Yes, I know), using glibc-2.1.1pre1
and binutils-2.9.1.0.23).
egcs-1.1.2 works fine, AFAIKS. But the recent problems with ping(1), which
I reported here, show that it's handling of char/short leaves a bit to be
desired...
