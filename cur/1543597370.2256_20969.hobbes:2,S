I think he is referring to the amount of hops between him and clients
accessing his servers.

I have seen sites that are 35 hops away. I'd say it's unlikely
to have more than 64 hops between you and any machine on the internet, but
if this guy is seeing ICMP Unreachables and it lessened when changing TTL,
then I guess there actually ARE machine out there with a lot of IP hops.
What problems could occur from raising it to 128? I'd imagine routing
loops might mean a bit more traffic, but if other major OSes are at TTL
128 and someone is actually having trouble with 64, then why not raise it?
