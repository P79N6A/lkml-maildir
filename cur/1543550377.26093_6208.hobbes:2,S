You *keep* ignoring the point. Please, Alan, the point is that all these
libraries were not forked redhat-only versions. You keep citing irrelevant
facts about library incompatibilities, but the fact is that all these
came from the official sources and were compatible to the official
versions. Even egcs made a large effort to become gcc compatible.
Why do you keep ignoring this point?
