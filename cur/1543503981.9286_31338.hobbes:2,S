Works here.

This sounded unlikely to me, so I sent two messages to myself.  The first
contained virtfs.tar.gz uuencoded + my .sig.  The second had a message
containing only my .sig with virtfs.tar.gz as a MIME attachment.
condor:~/mail/main$ ls -l test?
-rw-------   1 tr       tr           6365 Jul 26 16:46 test1
-rw-------   1 tr       tr           6912 Jul 26 16:45 test2
condor:~/mail/main$ 
i.e. on small files like this one, MIME produces larger mails than
uuencode.
