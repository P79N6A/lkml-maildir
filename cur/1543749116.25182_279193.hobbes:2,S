Hi,

> Linux already fronts the slab allocator with per-cpu pools.
Well, I haven't had such a deep look at the 2001 version (my topic was
the current implementation)...
I've seen the per-cpu pools. Bonwick talks in his paper of allocations in
guaranteed constant time (using vmem). Is this goal already achived in
Linux? There is a lock protecting the cache_chain, doesn't this hurt
scalability?
And what about the other improvements?
-vmem for allocating general resources
-A user-space implementation (well I know, that's a bit off topic here..)
Are they already implemented/is anybody working on this or are there
already known better solutions than Bonwicks suggestions?
Greetings,
Sven
