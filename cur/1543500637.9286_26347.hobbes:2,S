Yup. This is fixed in pre-2.3.9-4.
There's no filesystem corruption due to this, so fsck won't find anything,
but it _will_ result in holes with zeroes under certain circumstances. The
only way to get it to happen is to write a partial page after having read
it, and that's why it got into pre-2 without being noticed.
The only regularly used program that does this is "ld". Thus the
corruption in binaries and libraries.
