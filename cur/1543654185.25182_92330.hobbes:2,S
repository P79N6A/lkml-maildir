I got no indication that anything was moved into lost+found similar
to what I've gotten on test systems where the filesystem was
intentionally crashed.  No human y/n intervention required this time :^(
it just trashed things and then went on its merry way, and failed to
boot because things were messed up in /etc (and perhaps other places
in the / partition).

The e2fsck run seemed to me to go normally.  It reported that it
optimized some directories, but this has happened on other auto-fscks
of my ext3 filesystems without corruption under earlier kernels.  (This
is the first corruption I've seen in many, many years.)  But I didn't
capture the messages :^( and they don't get written into
/var/log/messages (that I could find).
When 2.4.20 final comes out, I'll set up a mirror system and try to
duplicate the problem.  I'll be sure to check lost+found, too.
(The system this happened on is my production workstation and isn't
suitable for testing.)  Thanks.
