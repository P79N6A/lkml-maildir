| 
| No. The "other" device namespace I would construct on machine B to
| look just like the device namespace that existed on machine A.
| Making /sys/devices/block/sda would still be 8:0.
| 
| So to be very clear on machine B when talking about disk-1 I would have.
| initial device namespace:
|   /sys/devices/block/sdb
|   /sys/devices/block/sdb/dev 8:16
| 
| "other" device namespace:
|   /sys/devices/block/sda
|   /sys/devices/block/sda/dev 8:0
| 
| Similarly on machine B when talking about disk-2 I would have.
| initial device namespace:
|   /sys/devices/block/sda
|   /sys/devices/block/sda/dev 8:0
| 
| "other" device namespace:
|   /sys/devices/block/sdb
|   /sys/devices/block/sdb/dev 8:16
| 
| So between the two devices namespaces on machine B the two disks
| would exchange their user visible identities.
So an application that would migrate from machine A to B has to
use virtual names (like "disk-1" and "disk-2") to access the disk
right ?
