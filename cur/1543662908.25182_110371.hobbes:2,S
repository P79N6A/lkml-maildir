Hi 
I don't see that anyone else has experienced this. It may be just my
particular Motherboard Gigabyte GA-8ST667. (SiS 645DX chipset) 
If I compile a kernel with 
IO-APIC support on uniprocessors , enabled.then, the system succesfully
loads up modules for USB, ethernet card,scsi card, soundcards e.t.c..
but they don't actually work... 
I found turning this off then allowed everything to work again. 
I couldn't find (or know where to look) for information that confirmed
what was happening. 
cheers
