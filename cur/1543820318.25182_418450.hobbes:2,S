Of course in order to use it in conjunction with SELinux right now you
need LSM stacking, which is a nest of dragons in itself (if not used
very carefully stacking can weaken security rather than strengthening
it...)

Oh, indeed not. It's just a stopgap that blocks some (large) percentage
of script kiddy attacks that involve downloading binaries and then
executing them, or even compiling them on the spot (not that those are
as common these days).

Yeah. I'll admit I've found signed binaries principally useful on
stripped-down firewalls and firewall UML instances. These boxes don't
tend to run, say, CLISP or SBCL or OpenOffice (at least if they do the
firewall maintainer needs shooting).

`Stripped-down firewalls' on its own is a big niche.
Combine it with SELinux, exec-shield, FORTIFY_SOURCE, -fstack-protector
and, say, a COWed filesystem read off a CD and reset with every boot,
and you start to get a bit less insecure than you would otherwise be.

Yeah, that's nasty: but the inverse face is that, for instance, nobody
can compile a new binary on my firewall without access to a private key
kept on a CD which is not normally in the drive. Replace `not in the
drive' with `at a manufacturer's site locked securely away from the
user' and suddenly this security benefit becomes an attack on
freedom. But that doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with it *as a
security benefit*: I haven't tivoized myself entirely *because* I have
access to that key, but there's no way any software can possibly tell
that.

Yes indeed.

It's another hurdle for the bad guys to leap, and many will fall at the
wayside.

Well, I'm using it, but I'd agree that the potential for misuse by the
tivos of this world is high. I don't know if it should go into mainline,
but let's not make it intentionally hard for it to exist
out-of-tree. It's useful to help professional paranoids sleep at
night. :)
(But, well, since the code *exists*, the tivos of this world can
*already* tivoize. I can't see what keeping it out would do, really.
I suppose it would increase the barrier for a would-be tivoizer.)
