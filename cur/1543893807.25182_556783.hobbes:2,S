Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/13/137

These two are for 2.6.22.  We have a patch which makes UML boot with
DEBUG_SHIRQ enabled and one which cleans up the xterm driver.
