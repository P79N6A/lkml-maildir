Hi, i updated my laptop to 2.6.13 vanilla kernel.
When i booted up it gave me some strange irq messages (debug) which
showed not up on 2.6.12.2 vanilla. I added irqpoll to lilo.conf, and
it removed some output. However before i did add irqpoll to lilo my
pcmcia cards worked also, after adding also.
Here is the output, maybe you can help me. (I did not change .config
from 2.6.12.2 to 2.6.13, just did a make oldconfig.)
cheers.
