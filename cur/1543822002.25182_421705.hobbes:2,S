I agree that there is no need for these checks to leak out of
page_is_buddy().  If its not there or in another zone, its not my buddy.
 The allocator loop is nasty enough as it is.
I think we need to do a couple of things:
1) check the alignment of the zones matches the implied alignment
constraints and correct it as we go.
2) optionally allow an architecture to say its not aligning and doesn't
want to have to align its zone -- providing a config option to add the
zone index checks
I think the later is valuable for these test builds and potentially for
the embedded side where megabytes mean something.
I'm testing a patch for this at the moment and will drop it out when I'm
done.
