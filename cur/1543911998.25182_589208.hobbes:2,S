If both crash, there is nothing for a client to reclaim and nothing
for a server to discard, so it is hard to see where a problem could
lie.

More details.  What, exactly, goes "haywire"...
If your client is diskless and mounting root from the server, then it
should be mounting the root with "-o nolock" and there should be no
locking issues at all.
Possibly it mounts some other filesystems as well, and they are
mounted with locks.  But still, I cannot imagine a problem scenario.
Please explain in detail your configuration (What is mounted where and
with what options etc) and what happens (why does the client crash
just because the server crashed - it shouldn't), and what actually
fails that you expected to work.
