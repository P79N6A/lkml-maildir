| Indeed.  Some drives can also do a timed defect scan using S.M.A.R.T.
You make the point I was going to question, is the cat (dd?) better than
a S.M.A.R.T. scan? I would think that the scan would be more likely to
be doing some special error checking, like turning off one level of ECC
or similar, and might see things a normal read might not. In other
words, the difference between no uncorrectable errors and no errors.
I am thinking of something like a C2 scan on a CD, to get error
detection without error correction.
