You're right, of course.  Thinko on my part.

I presume that was with the 20GB file?
If so, that rules out the filesystem as the cause.
I would do the following next:
- run the test on the device node (/dev/something), just to make sure. 
you will need to issue an ioctl (BLKGETSIZE64) to get the size as fstat 
will not return the correct size
- break out the array into individual disks and run the test on each 
disk.  that will show whether the controller is causing the problem or 
one of the disks (is it possible the array is in degraded mode?)
