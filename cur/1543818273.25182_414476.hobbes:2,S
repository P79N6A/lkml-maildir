Ok. I think I presented enough information for why I thought zone_watermark_ok 
would fail (for ZONE_DMA). With 16MB ZONE_DMA and a vmsplit of 3GB we have a 
lowmem_reserve of 12MB. It's pretty hard to keep that much ZONE_DMA free, I 
don't think I've ever seen that much free on my ZONE_DMA on an ordinary 
desktop without any particular ZONE_DMA users. Changing the tunable can make 
the lowmem_reserve larger than ZONE_DMA is on any vmsplit too as far as I 
understand the ratio.
