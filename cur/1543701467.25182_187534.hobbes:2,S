Of course there are also advantages to _not_ using the file-per-kernel
version scheme. Keeping one set of files means time is not wasted
applying the same change to multiple variations, removes the possibility
of patches getting applied to one version and not another and simplifies
the process of continuing to support old kernel versions. For merging, a
bit of test processing on the files could always be used to remove the
ugliness and clean things up.
