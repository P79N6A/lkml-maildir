Read the license.  The free use requires that you connect periodically to 
log what it is you are doing.  Those are the terms of use.  If that doesn't
work for you there is the CVS gateway and the SVN gateway.
If you are having problems with BK you might try support@bitmover.com
or bitkeeper-users@bitmover.com.
