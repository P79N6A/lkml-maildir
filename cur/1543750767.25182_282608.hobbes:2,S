Yet another follow-up on this.  After completely disabling SMP/Hyperthreading
on these systems, we have had zero NULL pointer dereferences.  Obviously can't
say for sure that this points to problems with the MPPE module--the only true
test would be to allow our customers to connect without MPPE and reenable
SMP/HT.  Obviously not an option in a live environment. :)
Guess we just won't be using SMP/HT on our busier systems!
