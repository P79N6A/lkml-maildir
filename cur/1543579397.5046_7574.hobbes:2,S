HPA,
Thoughts on granting all block subsystems a general access misc-char minor
to do special service access that can not be down to a given device if it
is open.  There are some things you can not do to a device if you are
using its device-point to gain entry.  Also do the grab a neighboor and
force the migration to find the desired major/minor is painful.
Cheers,
