Check the list of people on lkml, I think that is a much more accurate list
of "current developers" than CREDITS. Or look at who posted on the list.
You might classify by includes/doesn't include a patch, perhaps (people who
comment on a patch are helping development too... only flamers don't ;)

No... I have posted several patches, most of those that did get included
went in without my name (to be fair, they were mostly very small/simple).
Others I sent directly to the maintainers, some went in with my name on a
changelog or in the modified file(s), others without any mention at all.
Policy on this clearly varies from maintainer to maintainer (and perhaps
phase of the moon), so your idea will give data skewed at least by
subsystem.
