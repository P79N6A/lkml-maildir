Yes, everyone is happy now. It's a samba (3.0.4) server. NFS is
currently also broken on that machine (my fault). That server machine is
so dog slow that I'm currently not interested in rebooting it. But at
least smbfs is working now so I don't need to use rsync to access my
files anymore. ;)
Well, I tested mounting/unmounting it several times and it worked
without glitches where I had a nearly 100% chance of making it Oops
before.
