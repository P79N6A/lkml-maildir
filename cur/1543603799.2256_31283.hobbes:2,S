You can't be 100% certain.  But you can do timings.  And usually you can
infer what is happening in the caches from that.  For example if you
take timings with the cache enabled and disabled, and the speed is the
same you can be fairly confident that the caches doen't disable.
Having a final verification step where you ask the user to pull the plug
could add some extra confidence.  But even then weird cases of buggy
firmware could defeat you.
