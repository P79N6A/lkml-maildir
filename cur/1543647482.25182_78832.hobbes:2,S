Here is a set of patches to implement distributed clean.
A cleanup of Documentation/DocBook is included as well.
See diffstat and changeset descriptions below.
Can be pulled from 
http://linux-sam.bkbits.net/kbuild2
Regular patches will follow this one.
The whole purpose with this is to move out the centralised list
of files that today is present in the top-level makefile
to the individual makefile where they originally are created.
During a make clean, all makefile are traversed recursively,
and for each makfile all files listed with
clean-files := file file
are deleted.
Furthermore all *.oas, .*.tmp .*.d files are deleted in all
directories looked into.
The list of directories are build upon the normal obj-$(CONFIG_XX)
rules, with the addition of empty "obj-" and negative "obj-n" directories
are searched as well.
The first patch implements the infrastructure only, and therefore Rules.make
is touched.
The subsequent patches introduce the usage in the kernel tree, and the
net result is that CLEAN_FILES is down to one line, and MRPROPER_FILES
is several lines shorter.
The only new behaviour introduced are that firmware files are now deleted
during make clean, as any other generated files.
Based on a concept originally by Kai Germaschewski.

  kbuild: Distributed clean infrastructure
    
  Today there is a huge list of files in the top-level Makefile that is
  deleted during make clean and make mrproper.
  This patch add infrastructure to get rid of this centralised list.
  
  Within a makefile simply use:
  clean-files := files-to-be-deleted
  or eventually
  clean-rule := command to be executed to delete files
    
  Files specified by host-progs and EXTRA_TARGETS are deleted during cleaning,
  and the same is all *.[oas] .*.cmd .*.tmp .*.d in the visited directories.
    
  Deleting core files is moved down to mrporper time
  
  Patches utilising this and the centralised list will dismiss.
