We follow POSIX, which says that if IGNPAR is set, bytes with framing
or parity errors (but not break's) are ignored.  If IGNPAR is clear
and INPCK is set, check parity, and flag it via the TTY_PARITY flag.
If INPCK is clear, don't check parity at all.
Note that PARENB enables/disables the generation and reception of
parity.  INPCK controls whether you detect received character parity
errors, and IGNPAR tells you what to do when a character with incorrect
parity is received.
