Subject: [PATCH 000 of 10] md: Introduction - assorted patches for -mm
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/1/6

Following are 10 patches for md in -mm.  None are appropriate for 2.6.17.
First 3 are fixes.
Next 2 are functionality improvements (people keep wanting their spare 
   drives to go to sleep, so now they can).
Remainder are more sysfs access.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
