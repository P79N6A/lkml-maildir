Yes, kexec provides the option --initrd, so that a user can supply an
initrd image to be loaded along with kernel.

Is there a kexec-tools patch too? How does second kernel know about
the location of the first kernel's initrd to be reused?
In general kexec can overwrite all the previous kernel's memory. It
just knows about the segments the user has passed to it and it will
place these segments to their destination locations. There are no
gurantees that in this process some data from first kernel will not
be overwritten. So it might not be a very safe scheme.
