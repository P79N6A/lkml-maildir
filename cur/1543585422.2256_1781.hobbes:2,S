Hi Jerome.
As Mr. Hafting says, is seems that there is a softirq missing somewhere.
If this is the case, it should help to make some add some systemcalls in 
your program, since a softirq should happen at every system-call exit.
Try adding:
	getpid();
in the innermost loop, and see if it helps.
I would be happy to look deeper into it, so if you could send me your 
test program and I'll see if I can find anything. Please append the 
result from the code with and without the getpid call.
Regards
Anders Fugmann
