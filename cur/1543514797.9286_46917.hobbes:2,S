Hi,
I have a linux box running Redhat 6.0 with kernel 2.2.5-15. I want to set 
it up as a router with a configuration as shown below:
			eth0          eth1
			___\_______/___
			|  Linux box	|
			|      as a         	|
			|     router	|
			|_____________|
				|
			          eth2 (203.41.227.0)
eth0 and eth1 are my external interfaces while eth3 is directly connected 
to my network. So all packets destined for my	n/w i.e. 203.41.227.x can 
arrive on either eth0 or eth1. As far as my understranding is,  within the 
kernel code, it is the function "ip_forward" in the file 
net/ipv4/ip_forward.c  which takes a packet from one interface and forwards 
it to another.
My question is : if a packet is destined for my network say from eth0 to 
eth2, will it also be handled by ip_forward function in the same way as any 
other packet which may be forwarded.
I have not yet subscribed for the linux kernel mailing list. So please cc a 
copy of the reply to me.
thanks in advance
regards,
Vinu
