This question is more hardware related than Linux related, but I hope
it is not too off-topic for this list.
I will soon be in need of a high-speed serial port (at least 230.4
kbps) since I'll be switching to ISDN in the near future and want to
take full advantage of the improved speed of the connection.  My
Internet gateway box has an older model Super-I/O chip which does not
support speeds above 115.2 kbps.
I could go out and buy a brand new serial board with a 16C650 or
16C750 chip, but I happen to have an old serial board with a
ST16C550CP (recognized as a 16550A in Linux) chip lying around and
figured I could save a few bucks by getting a 16C650 chip from an
electronics dealer and simply exchange the two chips.  The chip is
seated in a standard 40-pin DIP socket and the board contains a 18.432
MHz crystal as well as a few TTL chips.
Will this work?
