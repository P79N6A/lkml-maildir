It will not help.  lseek() in question is relative and crosses the
record boundary.  I.e. we have
	n = read(fd, buf, ...);
	/* process k bytes */
	lseek(fd, k-n, SEEK_CUR);
and that will break just as the current variant does.  It's not about
seek to remembered position - it's a relative seek to calculated offset.
Calculated from number of bytes returned by read().
