Hmm, since struct inode has an unsigned int as nlink, it'd
seem doing this sort of thing is only useful for filesystems
where the ondisk nlink is a 16 bit value (and ext2/3/reiserfs
do seem to be in that category, afaict).
So, Davids patch (and those one/two other cases) would seem
to be enough to get this resolved.  There isn't much using
nlink_t - looks like mainly the non-stat64 'stat' calls and
one or two other (possibly accidental?) uses like we had in
XFS.
cheers.
