Subject: [PATCH - 2.6.15-rc1-mm1 ] Re-fix compat_sys_fcntl64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/18/41

Finally got some testing done on this, and it wasn't quite right.  We
need to return information from F_GETLK no-matter what l_type is - at
the very least we return a value in l_type, but might return start/length as well. 
This patch has been tested (LSB test suite), and works.
