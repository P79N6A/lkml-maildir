i think it fails here due to some IO error:
 9173  1184675906.674610 write(2, "konqueror: Fatal IO error: clien"..., 41) = 41 <0.000007>
could this be due to:
9173  1184675906.194424 ioctl(1, SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE or TCGETS, 0x7fff341af5c0)
= -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for device) <0.000006>
9173  1184675906.194463 ioctl(2, SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE or TCGETS, 0x7fff341af5c0)
= -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for device) <0.000004>
? Are those -ENOTTY results normal?
or perhaps the problem started alot earlier, at:
9173  1184675906.155015 write(2, "In file kernel/qpixmap_x11.cpp, "..., 56) = 56 <0.000006>
9173  1184675906.155052 write(2, "QImage::convertDepth: Image is a"..., 44) = 44 <0.000004>
9173  1184675906.155169 gettimeofday({1184675906, 155179}, NULL) = 0 <0.000006>
9173  1184675906.155249 write(11, "close(6f1c2f7):about:konqueror\n", 31) = 31 <0.000032>
i think konqueror tried to say something here about an image problem?
could you perhaps upload the strace to some webpage so that others can 
take a look too?
it might also be good to add "-s 1000" to the strace command, so that we 
can see the full messages that konqueror tried to log to some other 
task, i.e.:
  strace -s 1000 -ttt -TTT -o trace.log -f <app>
and perhaps try to do a 'comparison' trace.normal.log as well, with 
konqueror having no problems. Also a KDE expert's advice would be useful 
here too i guess ...
