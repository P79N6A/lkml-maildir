=======================================================
However, I can't find the actual error message.  Strange.
I have an off-topic question:
What happened to sym-53c8xxx driver?  It appears that nobody is
actively maintaining it.  Yet, there is not much complain traffic over 
any malfunction for this LSI's SCSI card driver.  Does it mean
that the latter is much more stable than aic7xxx driver for 
Adaptec cards?
Regards,
Hugh
