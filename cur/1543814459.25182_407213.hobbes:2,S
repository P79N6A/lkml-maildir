Subject: [PATCH] unshare: Use rcu_assign_pointer when setting sighand
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The sighand pointer only needs the rcu_read_lock on the
read side.  So only depending on task_lock protection
when setting this pointer is not enough.  We also need
a memory barrier to ensure the initialization is seen first.
Use rcu_assign_pointer as it does this for us, and clearly
documents that we are setting an rcu readable pointer.
