AM> Nikita, why cannot get_mem_for_virtual_node() use GFP_KERNEL?
Well, I am not Nikita, but this comment appears at the place:
        /* get memory for virtual item */
        buf = reiserfs_kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC, tb->tb_sb);
        if ( ! buf ) {
            /* getting memory with GFP_KERNEL priority may involve
               balancing now (due to indirect_to_direct conversion on
               dcache shrinking). So, release path and collected
               resources here */
            free_buffers_in_tb (tb);
            buf = reiserfs_kmalloc(size, GFP_NOFS, tb->tb_sb);
..
This should answer your question, I guess.
Bye,
