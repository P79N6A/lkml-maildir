Instead of giving up, how about look at the code and make a suggestion
for improvement?  It's not an easy problem, as you're well aware.
I really don't see why you're (seemingly) getting irate.  Tunables for
this are no different that tunables like CHILD_PENALTY etc etc etc.  How
many casual users know those exist, much less understand them?
