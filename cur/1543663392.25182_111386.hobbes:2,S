Nice. I'm glad that somebody started looking at this (I was going to work 
on that but didn't have time for it).
Patch looks ok to me.
Eventually we'll be able to kill ugly mess like arch/sparc64/kernel/ioctl32.c.
That stuff really belongs to the actual subsystems that implement those ioctls.
Thanks
