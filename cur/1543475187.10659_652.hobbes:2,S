Hello all, and sorry for the {once,yet} again offtopic post.
I am considering the purchase of an AHA 2940 to go with a
Barracuda 20-gig drive (not for me :( ); as I understand
that controller supports scsi ultra2 which this drive
supports. However, I was wondering (before saying yeah, go
ahead), is the 80mb/s of ultra2 "real" for a mail/http
server, i.e. is there any point in spending that more money
on ultra2? If so, what kind of CPU power do I need to cope
with this? Does the controller (and/or the driver) suck a
lot of CPU?
On the same lines, what ethernet/100 card demands the least
cpu time (always in linux :)? If it isn't only
card-specific, is there any MB that works best (without
being rare or expensive) ?
As this is not really kernel-related, unless you're *sure*
your post won't produce a deluge, please contact me
directly.
Cheers,
	John.
ps: I don't really care about it myself but I thought I'd
let y'all know: the information about the AHA 2920 is
unclear, at least. The help on CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX says it
doesn't work for the AHA2920 and you should use the Future
Domain 16xx instead, but the help for
CONFIG_SCSI_FUTURE_DOMAIN says it's really only the AHA2920A
that works with it, and you should use CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX
instead. The READNE.aic7xxx is most adamant about the 2920
NOT being based on an AIC-7xxx, and fdomain.c again says the
2920C *is*.  It would seem that the only 2920 existing when
the help on the aic7xxx was written was the A, and the C is
newer than that.
Attached is a really trivial patch against 2.2.0pre4 to
Configure.help and README.aic7xxx that avoids y'all the
trouble of looking this up, but it this is as trivial as it
can get.
more Cheers,
	John.
