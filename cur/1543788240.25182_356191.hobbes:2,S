Sorry, none of us is Brent Chapman.   :-)
But Majordomo is better than any other in free/open software
then or since in my experience.
Part of VGERs performance success is ZMailer MTA, of which current
main author I am, and our Majordomo installation uses several optimized
auxiliary programs to speed things up so that MTA takes up large share
of processing load with least possible CPU or IO expenditure.
