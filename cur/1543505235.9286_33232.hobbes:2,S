     Thank you everyone!  A number of people pointed me at gphoto, and that
does look like exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, I can't get to their ftp
server presently but the web site describes it as supporting quite a few
cameras, including the Nikon Coolpix 950 which was what I was primarily
considering (though anything that didn't need Windows would be a contender).
Thank you all!
