I'm trying this now and it's not exactly trivial; the patches conflict 
in some places so I had to fix by hand. Now I've got it almost compiled 
but it says:
fs/built-in.o: In function `kcond_wait':
: undefined reference to `there_is_no_init_MUTEX_LOCKED_for_RT_semaphores'
fs/built-in.o: In function `kcond_timedwait':
: undefined reference to `there_is_no_init_MUTEX_LOCKED_for_RT_semaphores'
I naively changed these two calls from
init_MUTEX_LOCKED(&name);
to
init_MUTEX(&name);
down(&name);
but I'm not sure if that's right. I guess I'll see when I try to boot it!
