An apparent fix was posted regarding an unresolvable symbol "is_binary"
in msdos.o kernel 2.2.6, said fix being to add EXPORT_SYMBOL(is_binary);
to fatfs_syms.c.
Upon trying to compile 2.2.7, I got a new unresolved symbol error from
same module, unresolved symbol fat_is_binary. So I added 
EXPORT_SYMBOL(fat_is_binary); [I changed the  EXPORT_SYMBOL(is_binary);
since I patched the kernel] to fatfs_syms.c, recompiled, and voila, its
working.
I have no idea why these two kernels are having these symbol problems with
the msdos module, any ideas?
