Just for the record: I posted full patches to implement clflush
support some time ago without changing any exported API. So your
claims that changing the API was needed to implement CLFLUSH are not
correct.
Also I believe some assumptions behind the new API are faulty (in
particular that the caller doesn't fully own the to be changed pages)
and make it actually impossible to implement the cache attribute PTE
changing operation fully correct according to the Intel x86 manual
(which requires temporary unmap)
