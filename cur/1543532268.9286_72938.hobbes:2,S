Yep. More precisely what I meant was to protect files from having random
contents that was previously on disk before the first data write to the
file (that's also _the_ security issue).

Yes, something like that. The end_io of the data bh can set a bitflag in
the inode that means such block is not containing sniffable/random data
anymore but that it contains something related to _such_ file.

Yes, it's definitely not zero cost (the inode gets dirtified also at the
end_io of the data block) but it would take care at least of the security
issue and of the completly random data in the file that is the bigger
concern as far I can tell.
For full data integrity data journaling is necessary instead.
