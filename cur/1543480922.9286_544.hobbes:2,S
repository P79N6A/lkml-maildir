This is a SCSI-machine. The ibmmca.c SCSI-driver is at the moment
non-working with the v2.1 kernels newer than v2.1.31 (!). Install the
driver from v2.1.30, and everything should work. You might have to tweak
it to detect the adapter, though. It should use 0x3540 as base-address.

It doesn't report 8 slots. It always checks all 8-slot registers even if
there are only 3 (as in the case of the 56slc2).

Oh, there is one. It's called rf955657.exe and expands to a disk from dos.
You can get it at ftp.pc.ibm.com in the directory pub/pccbbs/refdisks.
There's also a rd955657.exe file which is the advanced diagnostics for
that model.

I consider myself being one... :)
