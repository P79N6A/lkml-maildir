As there were no complaints about the patches posted a few days ago,
I've released 2.6.11.3 with them in it.
It's available now in the normal kernel.org places:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/patch-2.6.11.3.gz
which is a patch against the 2.6.11 release (note, this is different
than before, and should fix all of the previous complaints.)
I've also rediffed the 2.6.11.2 patch against the 2.6.11 release,
instead of the 2.6.11.1 release, and updated it.  There are incremental
patches between the 2.6.11.y releases at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/incr
If anyone has any issues with the way the patches are diffed, please let
me know.
A detailed changelog can be found at:
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.11.3
A bitkeeper tree for the 2.6.11.y releases can be found at:
	bk://linux-release.bkbits.net/linux-2.6.11
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.  
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.11.2 and 2.6.11.3, as it is small enough to do so.
thanks,
greg k-h
