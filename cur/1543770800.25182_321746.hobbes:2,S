oh and btw... on x86-64 you might want to look at using movnti with 64-bit 
registers... the memory datapath on these processors is actually 64-bits 
wide, and the 128-bit stores are broken into two 64-bit pieces internally 
anyhow.  the advantage of using movnti over movntdq/movntps is that you 
don't have to save/restore the xmm register set.
