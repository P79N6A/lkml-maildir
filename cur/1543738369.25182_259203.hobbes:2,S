Thats possible as well.

You can just keep the old ones and map them, so both old and new ones
will work (and internally only the new ones are used).
video_fix_command() does that for a number of v4l2 ioctls which
initially got a _IO* define with wrong read/write bits.  You can either
just add the videotext ones there or translate them in the drivers right
before calling video_usercopy().
