Thanks Jeff, so from reading all the responses here I can conclude that Linux 
innovates stuff by itself and not only gets it from other places. Is it also 
right to say that other kernels, be it BSD, Solaris, maybe AIX?, also benefit 
from the Linux innovations? eg adding stuff from the Linux kernel into their 
own kernels if their licenses allow it
