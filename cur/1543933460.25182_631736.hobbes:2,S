This is that same section from ACPI 1.0B:
3. The OS executes the Prepare To Sleep (_PTS) control method, passing an
argument that indicates the desired sleeping state (1, 2, 3, or 4 representing
S1, S2, S3, and S4).
4. The OS places all device drivers into their respective Dx state. If the
device is enabled for wakeup, it enters the Dx state associated with the 
wakeup capability. If the device is not enabled to wakeup the system, it 
enters the D3 state.
The DSDTs in question also claim ACPI 1.0 compatiblity.

No, I'm not entirely wrong - read the 1.0 spec, and read section 7.3.2 of the 
ACPI 2.0 spec.
* ACPI 1.0 is very clear - we are breaking the 1.0 spec
* ACPI 2.0 is contradictory - section 7.3.2 repeats 1.0 ad verbatim (which is 
what I quote in reply to Robert Hancock), but as you point out, 9.3.2 says 
the opposite.
So, 1.0 and 3.0 are very clear and rather different on this, and 2.0 is 
contradictory (and I presume this is one of the points ACPI 3.0 set out to 
clean up).
I will rescind my point on ACPI 2.0 - I don't know what we should or shouldn't 
be doing there, the spec is unclear.
But for ACPI 1.0, we are doing the wrong thing.
