After reading some more...  Is there any reason why mac/misc.c can't
simply use cuda_request() and pmu_request() instead?  At least for
read/write for time and nvram we end up with identical sequence of
operations anyway - if you expand the calls in
        adb_request((struct adb_request *) &req, NULL,
                        ADBREQ_RAW|ADBREQ_SYNC,
                        2, CUDA_PACKET, CUDA_GET_TIME);
[m68k]
and
        if (cuda_request(&req, NULL, 2, CUDA_PACKET, CUDA_GET_TIME) < 0)
		/* bail out */
        while (!req.complete)
                cuda_poll();
[ppc]
until you get to call of cuda_write(), you'll see the same code.  Come
to think of that...  Shouldn't the ifdefs for CONFIG_ADB_PMU in there be for
CONFIG_ADB_PMU68?  The former depends on PMAC_PPC, so it's not particulary
useful thing to check on m68k...
