Except if you go to the beginning of this thread, you will see that the
machine appears to be running fine in Uniprocessor mode. This concurs
with my experience. The only difference is that Artur switched the
kernel whereas I pulled a CPU (and kept the SMP kernel).

I only have 2 x 256MB in the box.

It appears to do the trick in practise though. How strange.
