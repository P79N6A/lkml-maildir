read-ahead doesn't matter on ripping audio, just for fs work.
The audio problems might be fixed in 2.6.8-rc1-mm1 + the bounce patch
posted a few times (unfortunately 2.6.8-rc2-mm1 drops the patch for some
reason).

So this happens during ripping, or? The problem with the errors like the
above is that they don't indicate a specific problem. I can't just look
at the error and see what causes it, it could be a million things.
