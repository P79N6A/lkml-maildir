I know this. I just don't know what data is in little endian and what data is
in big endian. say the following code ....
struct ext2_super_block  * es;
struct super_block * sb;
..............................
es->smtime=cpu_to_le32(CURRENT_TIME);    //why here use cpu_to_le32?
sb->u.ext2_sb.s_mount_state=le32_to_cpu(es->state); //why use le32_to_cpu here?
