Hmm, I had to run e2fsck -f twice on the filesystem that ran
dbench, tiobench, bonnie++ on nfs, and osdb.  The filesystem
was showing 52% used and is normally 1% used before/after
testing.  No big files on the fs. The directory where
bonnie++ on nfs runs had some temporary directories that
were not deletable.  A bunch of files/directories were in
lost+found after e2fsck.  After removing the files, the
fs was back to 1% used.
I backed up and did mke2fs in case there was any
pre-existing/lingering corruption.  So keep your karma
up and test on a test box. :)
