  Rather than expect people who have been following this to reread I'll
put this here. I believe the capability of nice(2) setting and restoring
is (a) very seldom useful given the new scheduler, and (b) can be done
with a bit of effort and no assult on SUS by doing the nice work in a nice
thread. 
  Code is attached.
