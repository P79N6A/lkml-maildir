weird. Could you do a dump with SysRq-T, SysRq-Q done /twice/ after each 
other, to see how the system progresses while in this lockup? Plus 
please also try to get a register dump via SysRq-P. 
Btw., the task state printout seems busted:
udev_run_devd ? C15B0030  2544   979    853                     (L-TLB)
shouldnt that be 'R' instead of the question mark?
