I actually already talked to a certain industry group about a different
program but will mention this idea also - some kind of industry notion
of "real time platform" probably wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm not sure
what the vendors would say/think, but it's probably worth having the
discussion anyway. I think we're all right now having to do a lot of
legwork in testing/certifying that systems have acceptable latencies.
