Andrea, if you got your head down in the dquota code (and have an idea
about what is going on there) you might want to look at the fact that
it is not SMP safe. I have a report from a guy who had it blow up on
him like 1-2 times/day when running on SMP, whereas it seems to be
fine on UP.
Don't take this as a 'you have to fix it' message, only a suggestion
if you have nothing better to do ;-)
