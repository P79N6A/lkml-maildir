The reason it was done this way is that normally, when the layers are
returned to the free list they're already zero'ed out (since their
elements have been removed one by one), so no need to do this on later
re-initialization or when freeing.  It's a silly little
sup-optimization.  idr_remove_all() is different in that it doesn't
incrementally zero out the layer, and so it has to do it using a memset.
If you want rework how this works, I'd suggest just not using the free
list except for in the idr_pre_get()+idr_get() sequence.  When a layer
is no longer used, just free it, don't put it back on the free list.
And use kmem_cache_zalloc() in idr_pre_get() as Andrew suggests.
cheers,
Kristian
