Yes.
rarp from old net-tools still try to open /proc/net/rarp and depending on
not avalaibability this file prints above message.
Seem it is undocumented in kernel documentation from where can be 
downloaded new rarp tool. Anyone know from where it can be downloaded ?
Previously pointed rarpd also cant be compiled without few changes (last 
release this package was in 1999).
