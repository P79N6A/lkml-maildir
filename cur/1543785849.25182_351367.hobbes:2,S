I'll try.
Now I have next call trace catched during reboot system after perform full 
backup on NFS volume (during this as previouse was tons of lookups). This 
case was during umounting NFS volumes (on system shutdown). Below call 
trace may have some typos because I read tem from screen and write on 
paper:
Badness in interruptible_sleep_on_timeout at kernel/shed.c: 3403 (Not tainted)
Call trace:
[00000000021c3cf8] nfs_kill_super+0x8c/0xbc [nfs]
[00000000004962d4] deactivate_super+0x58/0x7c
[00000000004ac5cc] sys_umount+0x2f8/0x308
[0000000000410fd4] linux_sparc_syscall32_0x34/0x40
[0000000000011ebc] 0x11ebc
Above may be is some resoult corrupting something during soft lookupus but 
if not probably may be usefull on finding bugs.
