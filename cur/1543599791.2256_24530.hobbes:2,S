Oops - I misinterpreted what you said. You mean "longer", not "larger".
Yes, this can be caught by a variant of the solution I proposed ...
   typeof(x) _x = ~(typeof(x))0;
   typeof(y) _y = ~(typeof(y))0;
   ...
   if (sizeof(_x) > sizeof(_y) && _x > 0)
       BUG();
   if (sizeof(_x) < sizeof(_y) && _y > 0)
       BUG();
Though I'm too sleepy to think about why there's a bug in this case ...
Isn't it only a bug if the longer arg is unsigned and the shorter is
signed? (I suppose the shorter is promoted with sign and then converted
to unsigned but I'm not going to get up and open a book to find out ..).
That would be:
   if (sizeof(_x) > sizeof(_y) && _x > 0 && _y < 0)
       BUG();
   if (sizeof(_x) < sizeof(_y) && _y > 0 && _x < 0)
       BUG();
Moral, always use ints.
