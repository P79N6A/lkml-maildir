Greetings;
I just took note of an odd error message from amanda, so I took a look 
at linux-2.6.7mm3, then -mm2, and found that while the advansys code 
is still there in the drivers/scsi dir, the config file entries are 
not, so its not possible to build this driver into the kernel 
starting with 2.6.7-mm3 without hacking it back into the .config.
Was ths intentional?
