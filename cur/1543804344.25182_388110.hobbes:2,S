I don't think it has something to do with the USB card, nor the HDD oder 
the DVD writer connected to it..
Just to be sure I bought a new USB card with a different chip even, 
hangs with both controllers..
Besides it freezes aswell if I do the ping and IDE to IDE copies and 
listening music.. Looks like high
IO loads brings it down, no matter where it comes from..
The wierd part is that it's only with Linux SMP, not with UP, and no 
problems like that on WindowsXP SP2..
This starts giving me serious headaches.. ;)
