[snip - big argument, ACLs, seen 100 times on lkml before]
DAC (ACLs) add flexibility to security configurations, no argument
there.  Flexibility != security.
DAC without MAC is insane.
Read "The Inevitability of Failure":

Yes, the current owner/group/other system is DAC too. Adding more
"flexible" (read: disaster-prone) features before MAC (eg. SELinux) is a
standard part of the kernel, is ludicrous.
And no, NT doesn't have MAC. Nor are they likely to get it. Guess why
any local user absolutely 0wnZ an NT box...
If you want to argue with me on these statements, please take it off
list.
