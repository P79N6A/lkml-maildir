I've fixed this in the current patches.

I haven't been able to reproduce this so far on my test machine.  I got
bored after about 10 minutes ("passed: 119200000").  The machine remains
responsive and the test dies immediately on hitting C-c.  I'll try it on
some other machines.  It would help to know what kind of unusable (crashy,
leaky, wedgey?).
Thanks,
Roland
