Hello,
I don't know if it's related or not, but under .47 if I enable fb,
switching from X to the console hangs my system, with just VGA console I
don't have this problem (and anyway, with my Mach 64 card since a lots
of 2.5 the console is not usable: the white is replaced by an ilisible
blue???).
Have a great day,
	Grégoire
