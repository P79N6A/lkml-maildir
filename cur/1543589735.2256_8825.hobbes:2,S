Seriously, I don't buy this "the application is doing something stupid." 
The application is using the VFS the way it is advertised to work.  If
you think doing ls on an extrememly large directory is painful, you have
never seen the droppings of an application which tries to do
load-balancing between directories by doing real hashing.  THAT is
painful!  At least in the first case you can use grep.
The only ones we fool by repeating the mantra "stupid admin, stupid
application" is ourselves.
