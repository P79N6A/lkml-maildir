Thanks, and thanks to everyone else that pointed this out.
It is still possible, though unlikely, that two NMI sources could occur 
at the same time.  Maybe that's not worth worrying about, and maybe for 
the APICs it works fine.

I should have been more precise here.  You cannot use a spinlock that 
you use outside of the NMI, too.  You might be holding the spinlock when 
the NMI occurs, and you would then be in deadlock.
