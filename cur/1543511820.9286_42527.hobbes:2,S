Which would be no less fallacious and no less correctable than if we did a web
page talking about the shortcomings of NT 3.01 as though they were current
problems.  Using the most recent stable release kernel and going from there is
the only reasonable thing to do.  Anything less would both hinder us and
Microsoft (they couldn't count those numerous service packs that aren't
official releases as having fixed their problems otherwise).
