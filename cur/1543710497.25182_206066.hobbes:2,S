It shouldn't. Perhaps something else is using memory in the background?

Well it is basically just written out and reclaimed when it is needed,
it won't just be swapped out without memory pressure.
Although, there were some highmem balancing problems in 2.6 including
2.6.4 (now fixed in -bk). This causes too much pressure to be put on
ZONE_NORMAL mapped and file cache memory in favour of slab cache. This
could easily be causing the misbehaviour.

There would have to be *some* memory pressure... honestly, try 2.6-bk,
or if they are production machines and you can't, then wait for 2.6.5.
