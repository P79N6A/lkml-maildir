I don't recommend it but if you do make sure those links can
only be made by root. 
SVR3 and earlier allowed manual hardlinking of directories
by root only.  They were a real source of problems.   It
also confused the dickens out of fsck so it would have to be
restricted or allowed by the filesystem code, not the VFS
layer.  I remember playing with it and it was a guarantee
that fsck would have to be run manually.
	$mkdir A
	$mkdir B
	$mkdir C
	$mkdir A/A1
	$ln A/A1 B/B1
	$ln A/A1 C/C1
	$rmdir A/A1
Assuming we can do this.  A1 is an empty directory after all.
Now B1 has a link count of 1, but i'll assume that is OK
	$rmdir A
It is after all empty even though the link count is 3.
	$cd B/B1
	$/bin/pwd
	cannot stat .
Remember B/B1/.. is it A with a nlinks==1
	$cd ..
Now where are you? It used to be called A but now it has no
normal path but can be reached through B/B1/..  It still has
.. so what directory is it linked to that doesn't have an
entry pointing back to it.
Lets some fun with it.
	$mkdir A2
Ah, now we have a directory the path to which is B/B1/../A2
We can hide all sorts of stuff here and find will never see
it.  It won't get backed up but maybe that doesn't matter.
What a lovely way to hide a rootkit.
If on the other hand you removed A/A1/.. when removing A/A1
you have a B/B1 and C/C1 without ..
Now umount the filesystem and run fsck.  B/B1 and C/C1 each
refer to the same directory with no .. or a .. that points
to a third directory with nlinks==1 and no directory entries
except a ..
You can put in a slew of logic to reduce the risks somewhat.
Things like only allowing rmdir somedir when
somedir->nlinks <= 2 || somedir/.. != .
but that still leaves the issue of where .. is linked and
the potential to bypass parent directory based access
controls such as Linus likes in a way that the admin will
have a hard time identifying.
The issues on a filesystem where .. is simulated would i
imagine be different.
