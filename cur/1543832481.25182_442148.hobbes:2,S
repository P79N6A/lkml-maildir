Yeah, that's lock_cpu_hotplug().  We've made a complete and utter mess of
that thing.
And I don't know how to fix it, really.  Is it a highly-localised innermost
lock?  Or a broad-coverage outermost lock?  Nobody knows, neither suits.
I'm suspecting is was a bad idea and we should just rip it out altogether.
- If a piece of kernel code is dealing with cpu-local data it needs to be
  running atomically, and that'll hold off hot hotplug anyway.
- If a piece of kernel code is dealing with per-cpu data and cannot run
  atomically then it should have its own cpu hotplug handlers anyway.  It
  is up to that code (ie: cpufreq) to provide its own locking against its
  own CPU hotplug callback.
Voila, no more lock_cpu_hotplug().
