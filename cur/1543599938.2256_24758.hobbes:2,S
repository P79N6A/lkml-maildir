Umm... Apply the arguments from the char_device thread - pointers to
unions are rather bad idea.  IOW, kdev_t must die - kernel always
knows which kind we are dealing with.

How do you tell when inode is not opened anymore? Notice that counting
openers of _device_ is wrong answer - several inodes can have the same
major:minor.  By the time when the last one is closed you may have a
lot of trouble finding other ones...

When do you reset it?

??? So you decrement twice on umount?
