I agree, even though I'm not sure if you mean the original .h algorithm, 
my fix, or glibc's system of reducing a Linux kernel version to a single 
integer for easy comparison, though.
I'm glad my hack is getting some review.  It's of the "ugly but probably 
reliable" variety.  More so than if I'd tried to fix the loop below 
it...  I felt it much safer to just fix the input string to give it 
those "at most three parts" that it was designed for.
All the best,
Pat
