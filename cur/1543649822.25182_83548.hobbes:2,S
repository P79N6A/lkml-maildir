Thanks for spending some time reviewing the barriers for me. While I was
thinking the reason why a rmb is needed here, I found that maybe we
don't need a barrier here at all. Since ipc_findkey()(the code above)
and the grow_ary() are both protected by ipc_ids.sem(there missing
document for this), so both the max_id and the the entries array seen by
ipc_findkey should be the latest one.
Also I think it's safe to remove the rmb() in ipc_get() for the same
reason. ipc_get() is only used by shm_get_stat() through shm_get() and
is called with the shm_ids.sem protected. (Maybe ipc_get should be
removed totally?)

Sure.  I will add such comments on all places where barriers are being
used.  I will do as much as I can to add more comments in the code about
what lock/sem are hold before/after the funtion is called.:-)

I thought about embed rcu_ipc_free inside the ipc_ids structure before. 
But there could be a problem if grow_ary() is called again before the
old array associated with the previous grow_ary() has not scheduled to
be freed yet.  I see a need to do that now, as you made very good point.
I will make the changes tomorrow.
Thanks a lot for your comments.
