Best damn drive ever made by any company.
I've got maybe 40 of these left in the systems here.  They're coming up on
7-8 years old.
Sure, they're dog slow.  Sure, they're pretty small(1.6 gig)
But they're rock stable and solid.  I use them for boot drives for old
servers, and for the old Windows PC's
