No, unfortunatly it doesn't work that way today, sorry.

If you can come up with a wrapper that will work, please let me know and
I'll be glad to add it.  Right now, it's pretty darn simple to do this
(look at the USB and PCI core code for examples if you need it.)
Anyway, groups are what you want and need, please use them and then you
don't have to worry about triggering an event later after you have
created your files on your own.
I'll try to get the time to add the "create a group and test the files
before adding them" variant soon so that firewire and others can use
them easier instead of having to roll their own code for it.
thanks,
