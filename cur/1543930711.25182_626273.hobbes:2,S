Thanks for the explanation.  Given that it's a bitmap doesn't that 
result in a cost of O(number of groups) when processing messages?  In 
our case we need potentially thousands of groups.

Also, good to know.

You may have confused me with the OP...I just chimed in because of some 
of the limitations we found when we wanted to do similar things.  In our 
case we created a new unix-like protocol to allow multicast, and have 
been using it for a few years.
However, if we could use netlink instead in our next release that would 
be a good thing.  A couple questions:
1) Is it possible to register to receive all netlink messages for a 
particular netlink family?  This is useful for debugging--it allows a 
tcpdump equivalent.
2) Is there any up-to-date netlink programming guide?  I found this one:
http://people.redhat.com/nhorman/papers/netlink.pdf
but it's three years old now.
Thanks,
Chris
