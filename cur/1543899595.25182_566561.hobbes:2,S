Thats an interesting question in itself. It does seem to indicate the
problem is DMA tuning or DMA related and not IRQ routing - which is good
as of itself.

For the next trick set mwdma_mask = 0x07 but leave UDMA off and see what
happens. Then try with udma_mask = 0x02 which should force the 50MHz
clock on not the 66MHz clock just in case its clock related.
How much RAM do you have ?
