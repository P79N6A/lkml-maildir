disable_irq(n) isn't something all platforms seem to define before the
IRQ is requested, In addition disable_irq() is not supported on some
systems the IDE code supports. I have to have local CPU interrupts
disabled on the CPU at the point the IRQ becomes live.
The former we could probably solve with "SA_DISABLE" to request an IRQ
that is disabled, but I'm not sure how we deal with platforms which
plain and simply do not have 'mask irq' functionality but are using a
level triggered interrupt.
