DMAs don't go on "forever" and at the time they are started they
are doing DMA to or from memory that is "owned" by the user of
the DMA device. In order for DMAs to continue past that point,
there needs to be something that got notified of a previous
completion to start the next one that you state is erroneous.
If such an erroneous DMA is occurring, it can only occur as
as result of an interrupt and ISR that is still in-place to
reprogram and restart DMA on the interrupting device. Therefore,
all you need to do to quiet any such erroneous DMA operations,
if they are occurring at all, is to mask off the interrupts
on anything that hasn't been initialized yet.
The newer PCI code design has a built-in problem that you
can't find out the interrupt it will use until you enable
the device. This means that there is some possibility of
a race between getting that information and putting in a
ISR to quiet the device which may still be active because
it was used during the boot. It think this is the more
likely scenario than some DMA that is still active.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
