Yep, it's more like ethtool(8) or cvs(1) in its syntax.  There is big 
difference in usability (for me anyway) between "command [options]..." 
and an unordered list of --args.  Especially as the list of commands 
grows longer.  It provides more structure.
Each command can have options, --foo-bar=baz if you like, I suppose.
