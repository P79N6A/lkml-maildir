What is this /proc/net/ip_alias?  I don't have that under 2.2.1.  In
fact, I can't find anything under /proc that shows the aliases present.
Is there no way to tell from /proc what devices have aliases, what the
aliased devices are, and what their addresses are?
Also, while looking at this, I see that the CONFIG_NET_ALIAS is a
totally unused option.  Shouldn't it be removed?
