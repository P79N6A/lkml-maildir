I'll try to see what I can do, it might take some time though. Quite busy at 
the moment and preparing for vacation, lucky me. :-)
And to be honest, since suspend2 works perfectly well here, it's not extremely 
high on my list of priorities (talking about scratching an itch), swsusp just 
misses too much stuff I heavily rely upon, and I'm used to for years. Sad 
enough I have to go through this again, after having helped out with testing 
suspend2 for more than three years.
