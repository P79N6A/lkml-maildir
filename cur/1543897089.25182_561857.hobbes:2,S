Still true.  :)
For that and a boatload of other SPI flash chips.  I'm
wondering just what that JEDEC standard covers; either
it's got useful command coverage, or vendors of SPI flash
noticed that converging command sets is a Good Thing.

Also still true...

Ping?  Have a look at
    
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2007-June/018706.html
which depends on the resent mutex conversion patch in the
"previous message" link of that patch.
That should highlight more reasons why at91_dataflash should
be reverted ASAP.  I'd expect you would be able to just drop
that in and have it work ... unless you're seeing that nCS0
issue built out of at91rm9200 errata, in which case there's
an experiment I can forward to you.  :)
