I didn't see any mention of what type of hardware you are using,
but COMMAND_LINE_SIZE is a #define in the Linux kernel.
You could change that, but that wouldn't "fix it."
The boot protocol interface (from LILO or SysLinux etc. to the
kernel) must also be changed for this to work.
See linux/Documentation/i386/boot.txt for that interface definition.
BTW, some other CPU architectures #define larger command line
sizes, but then they don't use this same boot interface (I
guess).

Good luck.
