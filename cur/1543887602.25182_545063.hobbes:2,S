What I dislike (and that also goes for fs/namei.c and such) that they use
numeral constants, i.e. 0x2. That seems error-prone. Could this (and
the in-kernel users of 0x1/0x2/0x4) be turned into some constant?

I do not think so. ENOSYS means Syscall not implemented. But it is
implemented. If ->i_op is not there does not imply ENOSYS.
Though, now that I grep through fs/*, I see that namei.c also
has that comment "shouldn't it be ENOSYS", so it's all at odds.

Does that mean I cannot create block devices, etc.?

No need to cast, size is already size_t. And then that left part
is somewhat superfluous.
