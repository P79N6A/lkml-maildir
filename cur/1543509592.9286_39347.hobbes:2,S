Sounds good. It seems the work is already done. But all I found is the patch
itself. No clue as to what version of kernel it is, and no other info besides
those in the config comments. Anyone has a clue on that or should I just email
the author? And what about stability? Anyone has this patch running in
production machines?
This is one particular patch I think should really go mainstream. What's the
Voice of the People?
