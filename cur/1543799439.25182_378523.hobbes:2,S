Sam,
since 'make clean' doesn't delete include/linux/autoconf.h (but
obviously does delete .config.cmd), .config cannot get updated anymore
if any of the Kconfig-s in the tree changes. Is there a particular
reason that include/linux/autoconf.h only gets deleted by 'make
mrproper', but not by 'make clean'? If that cannot be adjusted, I can't
see how else to force proper re-generation of .config through the
silentoldconfig target.
Thanks, Jan
