I tried, and it does not work. 
karpfen:/home/dreher # lilo
Added testing *
Added linux
Added failsafe
Added linux-2.5.56
Added linux-2.5.54
Device 0x0300: Invalid partition table, 2nd entry
  3D address:     1/0/20 (20160)
  Linear address: 1/12/318 (321300)
Contrary to what it prints here, lilo has added nothing.
It should write the boot sector for windows on /dev/hda5, but can not
do that because it does not understand the partition table anymore.
My box is running 2.5.56 at the moment.
I wanted to install 2.5.58. But lilo refuses to change the MBR, because 
of the number of changed heads. Even if I start it as lilo -L. 
My solution is: reboot into 2.5.54. run lilo there. reboot into 2.5.58.
Repeat for 2.5.59.
This is annoying. Any ideas how to solve this ?
Thanks,
Michael
