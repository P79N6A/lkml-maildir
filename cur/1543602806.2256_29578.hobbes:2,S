You would need to initialize gendisk_head->next to NULL *before* any call to 
add_gendisk(struct gendisk *gp) takes place. The latter is used in many other 
sources, to grow up the pointered list with additional partition info. 
gendisk_head always points to the most recently added item. 
When you step through the list, you reach the very first entry, which existed 
before any call to add_gendisk() was made. And the "next" field of that should 
point to NULL. 
But instead of this, it points to itself, thus forming a ring pointered loop.
I don't know in which part of the kernel sources, that pre-initialization 
of gendisk_head->next to NULL should be made. Maybe it is expected to be done
by the compiler.
But my fix works perfectly for me, resulting in exactly the same behaviour
as 2.4.9.
I should point out, that my 2.4.9 was compiled under gcc 2.95.2 (SuSE-6.4) , whereas
2.4.10 was compiled under 2.95.3 delivered by SuSE-7.2 ! Maybe that's the point.
