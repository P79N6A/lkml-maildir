Oh, I see.  I forgot about the changelogs.  I'd send out version 5
now, but I'm not sure what kernel version to make the patch against.
2.6.23-rc4 is on kernel.org and I don't see any git snapshots.
Additionally I never could tell what git tree was the 'mainline' as it
isn't labeled with such a keyword (at least in the list of git trees I
saw).
