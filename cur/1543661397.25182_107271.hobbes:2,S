I think I understand, but on my system it seem to take 5-8 seconds for
the bandwidth to get up to ~20Mbps (with my larger buffer settings mentioned
earlier).  This is with 25ms latency. With the default settings I can run about
8Mbps, so it would appear to me that only 3x the current default buffer settings
should get a window size enough to go ~20Mbps at 25ms latency.
Am I correct that if I have 10k clients doing their worst tricks, and
3 * (80k, my default according to the kernel) == 240k, then I have at most
2.4MB denial of service?  Assuming 60k clients, that is only about 15MB
of DoS?  If true, that is a fairly small time DoS considering the RAM available
on today's machines.
You claim for a very large N that the denial of service can happen.  I
am just trying to understand the upper bound of N, and thus the upperbound
of the memory consumption assuming each connection is using it's maximum
buffer size.
Thanks,
Ben
