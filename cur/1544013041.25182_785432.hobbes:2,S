Just provide a sample gdbrc that does all this somewhere in arch/um ? 
Then they would just have to source that file.
There used to be a similar one for kgdb which defined all sorts
of useful macros. Some of the BSDs even have their own collections 
of useful gdb macros in tree, I always thought this was a good idea.
