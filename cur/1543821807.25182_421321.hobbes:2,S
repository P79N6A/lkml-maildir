Hello!
I reported this issue at the kernel bugzilla some time in the past.
I'd like to know if there's a solution yet.
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5410
This is what I get: Shutting down my computer my mouse light stays on.
It's a 7€ Logitech USB mouse. Alexey Starikovskiy suggested in my
bugreport that it might be an USB issue.
Up to 2.6.13-rc2 this didn't happen. Since 2.6.13-rc3 the light stays
on.
I tried unloading the usb modules before shutdown, but I couldn't get
rid of usbcore. rmmod said it's still in use, though it didn't mention
by what.
Module                  Size  Used by 
usbcore               107136  1 
Right now I'm using 2.6.16.13 and the light stays on. I'm on a NForce2
Shuttle AN35N with a Sempron 2400+ and 512MB RAM. I'm using ehci and
ohci.
Please CC me in your answers. I'd be glad to help though I'm not a
kernel hacker.
