So?  Users of Linux know to look for their USB storage devices in
/dev/sd* because of this.

And udev causes this to be moot, as people use the /dev/disk/by-*
symlinks, which are the same if they use the usb-storage or ub driver.
Same thing will happen for the changes that Alan is going to do (which I
think is the right thing to have happen.)

Sure, but most distros don't have a static /dev anymore.

Because it has for USB storage devices since the 2.2 kernel.
Ok, 2.3, but then quickly backported to 2.2...  You want to break that
userspace interface?  :)
