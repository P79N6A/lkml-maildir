OK.  The 'Interrupt posted but not delivered' message
means that the Ethernet controller thinks that it is driving
the physical interrupt line, but the CPUs aren't being interrupted.
Check /proc/interrupts, see if the NIC's IRQ is shared with
something else.   If it isn't, or if it is shared with
something reputable then, given that the machine works OK
with 2.2 kernels then it's probably the APIC.
But it's unusual that the system "continues to work fine".
Ususally, a busted APIC slows networking to a crawl.  We
generate an artificial interrupt once per 400 milliseconds
via the Tx timeout handler.  This can process 16 outgoing
packets and 32 incoming packets.  This `polled mode' is
present in many Linux network drivers - it's there so you
can still telnet into the machine and whack it when it's
being silly.
