Better to initialize at the beginning of the driver initialization.
With this patch, the work struct is reset at each time you open the
PCM, which is inefficient and can be even racy.
Also, it'd be cleaner to move struct spu_work_holder into struct
snd_card_aica.  We'll have snd_card_aica pointer via container_of, so
sspointer can be removed (snd_card_aica has substream).
thanks,
Takashi
