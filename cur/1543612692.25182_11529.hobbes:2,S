Subject: The demise of notify_change.

Somewhen between 2.2.x and 2.4.x notify_change disappeared from 
super_operations.  What is the accepted practice now for updating an 
inode's persistent state?  Should one use write_inode for the same 
purpose or should one rely on file_operations::setattr (excuse the 
c++ism)? Or is there something entirely different that one should do?
With apologies for being behind the times (I'm trying to update a 
filesystem I wrote for 2.0.x, which fact dates me accurately.),
Britt
P.S. I promise to send REG amendments to his VFS doc when I get done.
