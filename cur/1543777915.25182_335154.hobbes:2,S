The hardware requirement i have dictate me that i have to have the skb`s
allocated in a specific zone, which is unfortunately neither contiguous
with GFP_NORMAL nor placed at the beginning of the physical memory.
I glanced over the typical usage of alloc_skb in  net/core and had an
impression that there is no way i can satisfy that requirement.
Am i missing something?
