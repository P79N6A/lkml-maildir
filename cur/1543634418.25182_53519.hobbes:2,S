Well... IDE 92 falls in to the "brown paper bag" cathegory.
Even the supposedly better error recovery code
there is wrong, since it can schedule from IRQ context.
So please reverse apply it. It should help.
I have a theory that I schould in no case write code above
25 deg Celsius and this is just confirming it... :-).
Sorry for the inconvenience, but I thry now to slow a bit
down on the amount of changes and to focus on stabilizing again.
BTW> Jens did you notice that the IDE_DMA flag is a "read only"
flag? I see basically only TQC code checking it. I would
like to replace the drive->waiting_for_dma flag field by the
proper usage of the IDE_DMA bit. Any way this could bite TCQ code?
The checks there appear to be only sanity checks anyway.
