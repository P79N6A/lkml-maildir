But your description makes it sound like you do
	untar kernel X
	apply patches Y
	make -j  Tree
I'm sorry if I'm getting you wrong, but each of these steps is
variable.
Even if X and Y are the same each time, "Tree" is different.
The test should be
	reboot
		N times
		make clean
		time make -j Tree
Am I misunderstaning your test?
