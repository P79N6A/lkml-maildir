This is due to your piece of trash motherboard. The reason that the older
kernel didn't catch these errors is because (IIRC) it wasn't looking for
them; they were there even then. The BP6 is a low-end mainboard and was
engineered very poorly; these errors are due to that fact alone.
Talk to you later,
