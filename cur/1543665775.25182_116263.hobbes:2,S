Have you had an opportunity to test this code yet? If you can't get that 
large a 32bit SMP box, you could fire off some 'extra' cpus on i386 then 
fail them during boot around cpu_up, making sure to put the failed cpus 
somewhere in the middle of your cpu map so that not only do you get a 
sparse map but some on the other side of 32.
