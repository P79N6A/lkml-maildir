Ok, since performance and detection seems just ok, I would suggest the attached
patch as a fix. Unlike Nicolas I don't see a need for an additional i830MP
patch, its only the correct detection of the different i830 setups that needs
to be done IMHO.
If there are no further complaints we should submit the patch. What do you
think Nicolas?

Stephan
