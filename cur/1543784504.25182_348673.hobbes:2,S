On a slightly different topic, how come we're using physflat for hotplug 
cpu?
-#ifndef CONFIG_CPU_HOTPLUG
 		/* In the CPU hotplug case we cannot use broadcast mode
 		   because that opens a race when a CPU is removed.
-		   Stay at physflat mode in this case.
-		   It is bad to do this unconditionally though. Once
-		   we have ACPI platform support for CPU hotplug
-		   we should detect hotplug capablity from ACPI tables and
-		   only do this when really needed. -AK */
+		   Stay at physflat mode in this case. - AK */
+#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
 		if (num_cpus <= 8)
 			genapic = &apic_flat;
Thanks,
