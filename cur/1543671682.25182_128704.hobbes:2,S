It would be interesting to compare the assembly output of the
compilers to see what's happening. The gcc folks appreciate test cases
and this function seems simple and sensitive enough to make a good one.

-march=athlon would give gcc a chance to make better scheduling
decisions, which could make the results more sensible.

This version of gcc accepts -march=pentium4, which again might make
gcc's behavior less bizarre.
