Additionally, looking back at my 30th June 2004 message, I don't
think I've even managed sufficient testing to make any claim of
working-ness or non-working-ness against either driver.
The test was merely a "did it successfully BOOTP" because I can't
get it to mount and run /sbin/init from the jffs2 rootfs which
2.5.70 was perfectly happy to earlier today.  However, the
failure point seemed to be when NFS tried to use the card.
Whether that means I was or was not using BOOTP back in 2004...
your guess is as good as mine.
Anyway, that's the end of the issue as far as I'm concerned.
