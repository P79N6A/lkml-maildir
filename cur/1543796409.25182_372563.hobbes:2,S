I tried this, but 
1) vhangup doesn't seem to close file descriptors, so it won't help 
   against the exploit
2) even if it did, the behaviour you described would kill all console
   sessions at once when you terminate one, which is very undesirable
3) it wouldn't prevent sb from running 'exec sleep 2147483647' and
   changing to another console hoping nobody notices.
