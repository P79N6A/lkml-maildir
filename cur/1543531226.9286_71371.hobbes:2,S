There is very definitely something wrong with trying to take memory
which doesn't exist.

Yes. In other words, a random process gets an error due to another
process, and (typically) dies as a result. Not good.

Find me a standards document which says "Don't kill processes to free
up resources in an emergency - just let the system collapse."

Of course not. If your process is hogging resources, causing problems,
I fully expect it to be killed. Do you just leave giant core files in
your root partition taking up all the space, or do you remove them
when you run out of space and processes start dying because of it?
