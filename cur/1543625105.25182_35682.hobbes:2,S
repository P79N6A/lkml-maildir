Let me verify that I understand what you're saying. Process A and B
independently open the file. The file is already in the cache (because
other processes regularly read this file). Process A is slowly reading
stuff. Process B does FADV_DONTNEED on the whole file. The pages are
dropped.
You're saying this is OK? How about this DoS attack:
	int fd = open ("/lib/libc.so", O_RDONLY, 0);
	while (1) {
		posix_fadvise (fd, 0, 0, FADVISE_DONTNEED);
		sleep (1);
	}
Let me see that disc head move! Wheeee!
