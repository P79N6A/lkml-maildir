No, this stuff:
nfsd/nfsfh.c
/*
 * Read a directory and return the parent inode number and the name
 * of the specified entry. The dirent must be initialized with the
 * inode number of the desired entry.
 */
static int get_parent_ino(struct dentry *dentry, struct nfsd_dirent *dirent)
{
...
This is because NFS file handles are a (dentry ptr, dir ino, ino) tuple.  If
the dentry ptr becomes invalid (server crashed, it was flushed, etc), then it
needs to reconstruct a new dentry by traversing .. up to /.  The basic problem
is that not all dentry references are within the kernel's address space.
Of course the existing code makes the completely bogus assumption that '..' is
always the second dir entry returned by readdir...
