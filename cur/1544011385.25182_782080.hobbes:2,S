What about situation, where some or all "public" channels in the system
have been claimed by one client for its exclusive usage
before another client appears trying to use available "public" channels?
Despite of presence in the system of channels that supposed to be "public",
the second cilent realizes that the channels are not available anymore at all
or at least limited...
Doesn't it contradict the general idea of "public" (general purpose) channels?
