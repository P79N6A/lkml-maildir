Hi
I upgraded to 2.2.11 a couple of days ago and I'm having no problems
with the tulip driver. I've tested it be grabbing about 50MB accross
my local LAN (a bunch of 6-10MB files) and it operated at normal speed
with no errors.
tulip.c:v0.89H 5/23/98 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
eth0: Digital DC21041 Tulip at 0xe400, 21041 mode, 00 80 c8 79 8c 16,
IRQ 5.
eth0:21041 Media information at 30, default media 0800 (Autosense).
