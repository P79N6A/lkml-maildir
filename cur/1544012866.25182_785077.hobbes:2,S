On one system, two Raptor 150s:
[    0.739402] ata1.00: HPA detected: current 293044655, native 293046768
[    0.739491] ata1.00: ATA-7: WDC WD1500ADFD-00NLR5, 21.07QR5, max UDMA/133
[    0.739577] ata1.00: 293044655 sectors, multi 0: LBA48 NCQ (depth 31/32)
[    0.742454] ata1.00: configured for UDMA/133
[    1.059146] ata2: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 300)
[    1.061406] ata2.00: ATA-7: WDC WD1500ADFD-00NLR5, 21.07QR5, max UDMA/133
[    1.061494] ata2.00: 293046768 sectors, multi 0: LBA48 NCQ (depth 31/32)
[    1.064360] ata2.00: configured for UDMA/133
Two disks in a RAID-1 (mdadm) configuration, how come the first one
has an issue w/HPA as the firmware of both disks is the same..?
l1:~# smartctl -a /dev/sda | grep -i bytes
User Capacity:    150,038,863,360 bytes
l1:~# smartctl -a /dev/sdb | grep -i bytes
User Capacity:    150,039,945,216 bytes
l1:~#
Why does this occur?
Justin.
