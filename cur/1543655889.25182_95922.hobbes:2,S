My hyper-threaded xeons beg to argue with you -- all 4 (2) of them.

Err, syscalls are still going to take the same amount of time no matter 
how much cache the chip has on it.  And, IMHO, adding more cache to make a 
processor faster is just as "dumb" as bumping the MHz.

The point many are forgetting is that processors do a lot more than system 
calls.  And P4's are quite quick at doing this.. especially those new 
3+GHz ones (with hyperthreading).
By the way, did everyone see the test on Tom's Hardware Guide comparison 
between the p4 3.06 with hyperthreading on and a p4 3.6 without 
hyperthreading..

For those of you who just want the info -- here's the spoiler -- when 
running multiple apps, the 3.06 can torch the 3.6.  Check out the second 
benchmark on this page
http://www17.tomshardware.com/cpu/20021114/p4_306ht-16.html
25% faster.  Most of the other benchmarks don't show off hyperthreading, 
as they're running a single process, but from personal experience, it's 
nice.  I don't know why they give you the option to turn it off in the 
bios.  I have 2 xeons, and even then I leave HT on on both.  I'd not even 
think about considering turning it off if I only had 1 processor..
