it looks good to me, but wouldnt it be simpler (in terms of patch and 
architecture impact) to always retry the follow_page() in 
get_user_pages(), in case of a minor fault? The sequence of minor faults 
must always be finite so it's a safe solution, and should solve the race 
too. The extra overhead of an additional follow_page() is small.
Especially with 2.6.13 being close this looks like the safest bet, any 
improvement to this (i.e. your patch) can then be done in 2.6.14.

When get_user_pages for write access races with another process in the page
fault handler that has established the pte for read access, handle_mm_fault
in get_user_pages will return VM_FAULT_MINOR even if it hasn't made the page
correctly writeable (for example, broken COW).
Thus the assumption that get_user_pages has a writeable page at the mapping
after handle_mm_fault returns is incorrect. Fix this by retrying the lookup
and fault in get_user_pages before making the assumption that we have a
writeable page.
Great work by Robin Holt <holt@sgi.com> to debug the problem.
