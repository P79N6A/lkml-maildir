Works for me, but it produces all kinds of crackly noise garbage.  I'm
not sure if this is because the driver has a bug, or the sound card is
a piece of flaming shit.  But I'm inclined to believe the latter.
Anybody have a suggestion for a card that isn't a flaming piece of shit,
(and not made by Creative) less than $100 US, PCI, supported by linux,
and available?
Cheers,
