Stressing this SX8 card broke with CARM_MAX_Q anything higher than
16. Tests included simultaneous iozones, bonnie++'s, fsx, badblocks,
and mkfs'ing, on 4 ports. Setting CARM_MAX_Q to 17 or above
resulted in errors such as:
Buffer I/O error on device sx80_0p1, logical block 108828
lost page write due to I/O error on sx80_0p1
end_request: I/O error, dev sx80_2, sector 389167
It's been thrashing away with various tests most of today with
CARM_MAX_Q = 16, and it hasn't missed a beat.
Thanks must go to Matt Johnston who actually did all the work of
giving the card and drives a hard time.
Bernard.
