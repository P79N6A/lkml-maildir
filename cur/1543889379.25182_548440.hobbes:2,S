Well, the only case where I feel a regression is justified is one where it
is caused by a bug in the firmware or the hardware.
At which point my personal opinion is that users of firmware/hardware *that
have a fix available* are to be told to apply the fix, unless the problem is
so serious that it could potentially cause extreme damage (loss of human
life, permanent hardware damage, major data loss).
If there is no fix the user can apply, then it really depends on how
damaging it is to work around the issue for others: you don't punish those
who have non-broken stuff to avoid problems for those that have broken
stuff.
Fortunately, most of the time one can come up with a fix that causes little
to no loss to those with non-broken hardware/firmware.
