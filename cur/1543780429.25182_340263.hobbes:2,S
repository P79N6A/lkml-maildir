Also remember that some people do not have a choice.  They are stuck with 
the crappy laptops that purchasing gets.
I am in a similar bind.  I was planning on swapping out the minipci 
Broadcom card.  Only after I purchaced the laptop did I find out that the 
bios was set to only recognise that wireless chipset.  (Other than that it 
is an incredible AMD 64 laptop.)
The biggest problem with ndisdriver is that it does not work with 64 bit 
kernels (last I checked) and it does not work with Kismet/AirSnort/etc.
