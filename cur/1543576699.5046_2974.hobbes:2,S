Sure. 
Look at this comment on try_to_unuse():
             swap_device_lock(si);
             for (i = 1; i < si->max ; i++) {
                 if (si->swap_map[i] > 0 && si->swap_map[i] != SWAP_MAP_BAD) {
                                /*
                                 * Prevent swaphandle from being completely
                                 * unused by swap_free while we are trying
                                 * to read in the page - this prevents warning
                                 * messages from rw_swap_page_base.
                                 */
                                if (si->swap_map[i] != SWAP_MAP_MAX)
                                        si->swap_map[i]++;
                                swap_device_unlock(si);
                                goto found_entry;
...
I think that incrementing the swap entry count will not allow swap from
removing the swap entry (as the comment says)
What I'm missing here?
Thanks
