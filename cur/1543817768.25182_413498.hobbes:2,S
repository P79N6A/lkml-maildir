I've been working on a way to sanitize the headers. I've come up with a 
process, that works for what I do, and hope to expand it with all the 
positive feedback I've been getting. The product of this research is at 
http://ftp.jg555.com/headers/headers2,
 and has a requirement of unifdef, 
which is listed in the script itself.
When I was working on this project, I've noticed a lot of headers are 
missing minor little things. Example. most if the if_*.h files are 
missing asm/types.h. linux/input.h has a complete procedure that should 
be under __KERNEL__. Should I submit these as bugs along with the 
patches? I have no problem submitting them.
Please advise me on the proper procedure on the findings, I can provide 
more details, but everything is in my little script for sanitizing the 
headers.
Thank you for all your help
