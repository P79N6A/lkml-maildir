Well, I'm feeling that's what Linus is tryig to say too. :-)
I, for one, don't really want to cope with a situation I don't feel comfortable
in, because in the long run that leads to growing frustration.  It seems pretty
obvious to me that people generally get more and more frustrated with the
current development process and it will have to be addressed somehow anyway.
If there's a problem, and I think that there really _is_ one, we should at
least try to _address_ it instead of just trying to duck it.
