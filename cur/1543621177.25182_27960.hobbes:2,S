The ALSA YMFPCI driver doesn't seem to be functioning.
I enabled the OSS API compatibility (so that I don't have to change my 
players' config), but I hear nothing but scratchy-type sounds.
I realize this is not a high priority thing, so just consider this a 
heads up.
I'll try to test more and come up with a more specific bug report.
