   You really make me laugh!
I'm glad that we've established that we both provide endless amounts
of comedy for each other.
Look Justin, the fact remains that you get paid top dollar to maintain
the Linux Adaptec driver.  If you can't be bothered to reliably
integrate fixes that show up in Linus's and Marcelo's tree, then
that's regretfully sad given your circumstances.
Now that is what makes me laugh!
