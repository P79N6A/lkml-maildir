When you claim that somoene else's work is a derivative work of yours, that
is precisely what you are doing. You are arguing that they could not have
even created that work without your permission.

Not so. See any of the numerous cases that explain that you cannot own a
function using copyright. They are saying that because V J did X, he *MUST*
be taking their code because there is no other practical way to *do* X. This
is precisely what copyright *DOES* *NOT* *LET* *YOU* *DO*.

The fact that they are claiming rights that are impossible with copyright
and inconsistent with its logic. Copyright covers the one way you chose to
do something out of the many possible ways to do it. To argue "you must have
taken my code because you were able to *DO* X" is arguing you own every
practical way to do X. This is what software patents do, but this is beyond
the scope of copyright.
How can they know he took their code to accomplish a particular function
unless they are claiming they own every way to accomplish that function?
This is precisely what the open source community stands *AGAINST*.
(Ownership of functions.)
