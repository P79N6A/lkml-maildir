The 2.2 IDE driver disables interrupts for up to around 20ms. I
suspect that this depends on the drive. i.e. it sometimes waits inside
the IRQ for the drive to do its thing instead of waiting for the next
interrupt. This is probably a problem in the drive, that we simply
used to handle a lot better before....
