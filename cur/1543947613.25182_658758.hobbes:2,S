ummm, now why did we made that decision...  I think we decided that it's
the sort of thing which one person can run once per few months and that
will deliver its full value.  I can maintain it in -mm and we're happy - no
need to add it to mainline.  No strong feelings either way really.
It does have the downside that the kernel explodes if someone adds unlikely
or likely to the vdso code and I need to occasionally hunt down new
additions and revert them in that patch.  That makes it a bit of a
maintenance burden.
