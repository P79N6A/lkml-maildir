It *is* actually safe.  The "#ifdef CONFIG_PARAVIRT / #include
<asm/paravirt.h> / #else / <... native versions...>" is to give a big
hint to the reader to look in paravirt.h for the real definitions.
Originally I had a noparavirt.h where all these lived, and people hated
it.  So we did it this way, which minimizes churn.
