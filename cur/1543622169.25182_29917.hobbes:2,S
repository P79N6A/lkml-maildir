I totally agree.  Network devices are now configured by the hotplug
agent and can handle different PCI probe order, rearranging cards in a
system, and other fun things that cause them to be initialized in a
different order.  All of this now "just works" as far as the user is
concerned.
I don't see why SCSI should be any different.
