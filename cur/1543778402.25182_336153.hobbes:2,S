Patrick McHardy is currently working on some ideas on how to extend
netlink.
The fundamental problem that the connector is trying to solve:
1) provide more 'groups' (to transport more different kinds of events)
2) provide an abstract API for other kernel code, so it doesn't have to
   know anything about skb's or networking.
IMHO issue number '1' should (and can) be adressed within netlink.  Wait
for Patrick's work on this to show up on netdev.  We can then think
whether the connctor API (or something similar) can be put on top of it.
