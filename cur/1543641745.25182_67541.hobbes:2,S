As far as implementing it goes, some instances of page_cache_release are
already under the lru lock and would need an alternative, non-locking
version.
The current patch seems satisfactory performance-wise and if it's
also raceless as it's supposed to be, it gives us something that works,
and we can evaluate alternatives at our leisure.  Right now I'm afraid
we have something that just works most of the time.
I think we're getting to the point where this needs to get some heavy
beating up, to see what happens.
