Here is all I configured :
...
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_HARDIRQS=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL=y
# CONFIG_CLASSIC_RCU is not set
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y
CONFIG_RCU_STATS=y
...
CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_RT_MUTEXES=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_PI_LIST=y
CONFIG_RT_MUTEX_TESTER=y
CONFIG_WAKEUP_TIMING=y
CONFIG_WAKEUP_LATENCY_HIST=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_TRACE=y
CONFIG_CRITICAL_PREEMPT_TIMING=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_OFF_HIST=y
CONFIG_CRITICAL_IRQSOFF_TIMING=y
CONFIG_INTERRUPT_OFF_HIST=y

CONFIG_DEBUG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS=y
CONFIG_LATENCY_TIMING=y
CONFIG_CRITICAL_LATENCY_HIST=y
CONFIG_LATENCY_HIST=y
CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE=y
...
If you want to known what I have in :
/proc/latency_hist/preempt_off_latency and in /proc/latency_hist/interrupt_off_latency
I suppressed all lines with a zero at the end.
There are no infos in these files.
