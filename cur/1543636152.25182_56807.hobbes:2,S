Whilst I don't have a definitive diagram, the "back of a napkin" 
sketches we came up with at an OLS dinner looked like this:
     I/O -- A ------ B ---- E ------ G -- I/O
            |           \/           | 
            |           /\           | 
     I/O -- C ------ D ---- F ------ H -- I/O
(please excuse my poor artistic skills). That reduces the max
hops from 4 to 3 (if I haven't screwed something up).
