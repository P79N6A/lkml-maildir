However as soon as I start up X with KDE I get regular spin ups every 30 seconds. Looking at the output of "echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/block_dump", I see an entry every 30 seconds of "kdeinit(15145): WRITE block 65680 on hda1" followed by a whole load of "reiserfs/0(12): dirtied page" and "reisers/0(12): WRITE block XXXXX on hda1".

Won't help him if kdeinit is doing fsync() on every friggind write.
syslog has an option to disable that, that's all.
That's what evolution was doing until some friends helped me build an
fsync "NOP" wrapper .
This e-mail is written using "LD_PRELOAD=no-fsync.so evolution", and the
disc does not spin up every time I switch to another folder or just
another e-mail.
(Yeah, I know it's not an good ideea if I care about my e-mail, but I
keep backups... :)
Now I wonder what will happen if I do this system-wide...
hmmm... candy...
