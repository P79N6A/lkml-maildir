This is all nice and good, but you have to bring this up with the
SELinux people _now_ since, as I said before, the current
SELinux-enabled userland code might not even start with this change of
the format even if SELinux is not enabled.  If it is decided that
/proc/*/attr/current does not belong to SELinux alone, then the guys
should be told about it now so that all the relevant code (libselinux,
kernel without your "stacker" stuff, ...) can be changed before the
current use spreads too far.
