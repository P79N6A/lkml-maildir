Well, it doesn't matter what uid a thread has if its not in the kernel,
so changes only need to take effect when the uid actually matters.
If the thread is in the kernel at the time some other thread changes the
shared creds, you can't have the UID change under its feet, so it takes
effect next time that thread enters the kernel and needs to use the uid.

You don't need to signal anything.  The threads can poll the shared
credentials when it matters to them, and update their own credentials
as necessary.  To an entirely user-bound thread, it doesn't matter if
the shared uid changes a 100 times behind its back.  But I agree, it
can be done in user-mode.

Yes, but it needn't be as complex as putting locking everywhere.  In the
case where there was no shared credential change, the fast path is still
pretty fast.
