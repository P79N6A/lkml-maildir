I heartily second this!! If "pre" == "bk", then make it "pre"!

Errh... personally, I find the -rc-bk snapshots to be useful sync
points. They're also what seems to make it into davej's
"rawhide"/"fc-devel" Fedora testing kernels. (Perhaps those don't get
widely tested, but they do get *some* testing -- e.g. they're how I
managed to hit (and get fixed) the TCP stack overflow.)
I guess the best thing would be for the script to revert to the current
("-bk") naming scheme once -rc1 is out. Otherwise it would need to do,
say, 2.6.12-rc2-pre1 instead of 2.6.12-rc1-bk1, and while that seems
natural to me, I don't know how the rest of the planet's human population
would react...
