Apologies for the delay, I've been having some email trouble.  Future followups
will be a lot quicker.

Uh, there's a broken RAID implementation in a stable kernel?

Hmm, I sense a contradiction here: 2.2.x RAID is incompatible with the latest
RAID patches and so will stay in, but 2.2.x RAID is unstable and unmaintained.
If you don't mind my asking, what kind of logic motivated that policy?
But seriously.  So what you're telling me is that I need to back up all of my
data, install a patched kernel (and Debian raidtools2), and completely wipe and
reinstall the RAID arrays, right?  Are there any tools to translate old RAID
arrays into new ones?
Please seriously consider the attached patch for 2.2.15.  It will save a lot of
time and grief for RAID amateurs like myself.

I set this up in August, so I'm not covered by this. :-)  And I think from the
above you can determine that I hardly qualify as "serious"- it took me three
months to build my first kernel for the machine!  The only reason I'm here on
the vger list is that in spite of multiple posts to debian-user since late
November, nobody there gave me an answer even half as helpful as yours!!
Quite disappointed,
