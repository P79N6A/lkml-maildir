I am uploading a new patch. The interesting differences between previous
patches is that this one will release the kernel lock before every
copy_from/to_user (or related user-faulting functions) _and_ during the
clear-page if __GFP_WAIT was specifyed. This time it won't bloat the
binary image because I am releasing the kernel_flag in a not-inlined slow
path. It includes my latest asm 686 changes in the cksum routine, and my
RFC-complaint changes to the delayed-acks code that according to me should
improve performances at least using MPI applications).
