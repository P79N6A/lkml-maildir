If someone uses some of them in code to be contributed to the linux1394 
project, re-adding the EXPORT_SYMBOL's in question is trivial.
If someone uses some of them in a custom setting, re-adding them is 
trivial, too.
If the only user of one or more of these EXPORT_SYMBOL's was a non-free 
module, it's kernel policy that the EXPORT_SYMBOL's in question have to 
be removed.
