===========================================================================
	I have compiled with and without PIIXn configured with no change, with
and without FAT also and I have no FAT drives on the machine. After the
failure, I did the show regs, show state, ALT-SysRq-s, ALT-SysRq-u, then
ALT-SYSRq-b, then 2.2.12-pre8 boots up fine, mount is 2.9o.
