When I have the IXDP465 in PCI Option mode, Linux still writes to pci 
configuration space which confuses the heck out of the PCI Host (Windows 
2003). What do I need to do in order to have Linux work as a PCI option but 
still not mess with the pci configuration, and leave that task to the PCI 
Host?
