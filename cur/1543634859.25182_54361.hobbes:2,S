Hello,
I have a patch which let sendmsg use copy_from_user instead of
csum_and_copy_from_user when a NIC supports HW-checksumming.
It just works on kernel 2.4, I haven't ported it on kernel 2.5 yet.
If you want it I'll port it after I come back from OTTAWA.
You can get the patch against kernel 2.4 from
ftp://ftp.valinux.co.jp/pub/people/taka/tune/2.4.17/va-udptcpchecksum-2.4.17-test1.patch
Would you try it?

Thank you,
