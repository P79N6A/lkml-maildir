  Any chance this will cure the lockups on a Dell Latitude C600 every time
you exit X? I've disabled both the IO-APIC and APIC-uni, which was
supposed to fix the problem but didn't. Dare I hope that the disable
wasn't enough?
  A quick google tells me other people have the same problem, but I
haven't seen a working solution yet. Nice machine other than needing to be
rebooted after every use of X :-(
