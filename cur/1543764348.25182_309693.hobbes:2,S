Ok, that's probably not enough to fully trigger some of the problems
I've seen on large-memory NFS clients.

NFS writes of single files much larger than client RAM still have
interesting issues.

Yes, you want more frequent and smaller writebacks.  It may help to
reduce vm.dirty_ratio and possibly vm.dirty_background_ratio.

This is probably the rpciod's and pdflush all trying to do things
at the same time and contending for the BKL.

That's not so bad, it's only about 3% of the system's pages.
