Exactly -- I did mention the growing access time gap between RAM and
disks in an earlier message. Yes, there are quite a few developments in
hardware and in the way we use computers (interactive, Client/Server,
dedicated machines, etc.) that made thrashing pretty much unsolvable
at an OS level. Fortunately, fixing it in hardware by adding RAM works
for most.
What we _can_ do in software, though, is prevent thrashing as long as
possible. Comparing 2.4 and 2.6 shows that a kernel can still make a
significant difference with smart pageout algorithms, I/O scheduling etc.
But you won't get much help with that from ancient papers.
