The two queues are used for sorting purposes ONLY. There is the
dispatch queue to which the requests are moved from one of the queues
and the request is processes of the dispatch queue.
Example:
Current request  = 40
Q1 = 55 58 67 72
Q2 = 10 23 38
Assuming no other request arrives, these will be pushed on the
dispatch queue in the following order
55 58 67 72 10 23 38
I hope this clears things up.
Also I have found that the patch that I had submitted earlier has few
bugs in it. I am going to fix those and then submit a patch for 2.6.16
Thanks.
