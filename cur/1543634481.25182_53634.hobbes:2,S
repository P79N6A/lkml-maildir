ACK. I'm looking into it; should have something before I leave for Ottawa.

This is an important point, and one I will be stressing heavily in Ottawa. 
The device model != driverfs. The new device model is about refining the 
kernel representation of device-related objects: devices, drivers, bus 
drivers, and class drivers. 
A filesystem just happens to map very nicely onto internal hierarchial 
structures, which is why it was created. driverfs makes no sense with the 
device model infrastructure to populate it. But, the device model core can 
theoretically be separated from the driverfs implementation.

I made a patch a while back that mapped ACPI-enumerated devices back to 
physical objects in the system. This got rid of the duplicate ACPI 
entries, and should be done generically enough to port it to other 
firmware enumerators. (It depends a couple of other patches that have not 
made it out yet, but I'll bring the whole slew to Canada so people can 
see how it works).
OF wrt the device tree is something I've talked to a few people about. 
Things were much more nebulous than now, and talk is still cheap. Ideally, 
OF should populate the device tree in a similar manner, but I don't think 
anyone has had the time to make it happen...
