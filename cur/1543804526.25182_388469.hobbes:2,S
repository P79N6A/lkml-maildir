Just like the OSS-ALSA/e100 debate: If there IS something that you 
do not like [something that requires devfs], why has NO ONE objected? 
(Quoting Greg: "and I have not heard a single peep out of anyone about the 
email titled "Subject: devfs going away, last chance to complain"") Not to 
forget there is ndevfs if you really need it.
