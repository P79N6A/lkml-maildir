What does "git log" state? Do you have recent state there? (ie it should 
have dates in the "Sep 12" kind of timeframe)
Also, if you have done something earlier that updated your HEAD file
_without_ actually updating your checked out status, then "git checkout" 
may decide that it has nothing to do. You can try "git checkout -f" in 
that case.
