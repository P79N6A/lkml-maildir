I seem to have the same problem, just not as frequent: four drives of this
type, connected to an SiI 3132 and an nVidia MCP55; resets occur on both
controllers, and only with this drive type, not with several Maxtor 6B200M0.
I never thought to check, but all drives on the nv controller have NCQ
disabled according to /sys/block. So maybe it's not (directly) NCQ related?
