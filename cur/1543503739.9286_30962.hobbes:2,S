1.) The original poster was talking about the DOS partition table, not
max. size of filesystems. As a solution to that: with Linux supporting
so many partitioning formats, there must be one that supports more than
2TB?
2.) AFAICR from my Atari days, FAT12/16 had _many_ (ie. more than
necessary) 'reserved cluster numbers', indiating end of FAT chain or
defect clusters. I wonder if the missing 4 bits are dedicated to this
purpose?
