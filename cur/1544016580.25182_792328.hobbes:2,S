nest could get quite large (and basically is unbounded), though. I
think there would definitely be variations (NMCS locks is interesting).
But OTOH I think that for _most_ spinlocks, optimising for spinning
case is wrong. For some really tricky global spinlocks, yes I think
MCS is a good idea. But moreso as a stopgap until hopefully more
scalable algorithms are written.
