The largest kernel image i've had so far was slightly above 40MB so at 
least in the kernel we are not there yet ;-)
Do you have any experience with how much of a size difference there is 
when binaries are built for big address mode? I'd expect something in 
the neighborhood of 5% for an image with a structure similar to the 
kernel's but maybe it's more.

... which brings back happy memories of DOS extenders ;-)
