I agree that your idea to transfer the STOP/CONT management in the calling
process rather the in the managed process seems good. But, you will have to
also transfer from do_signal() in ptrace(), the STOP/CONT management of a
traced process (which is similar to STOP/CONT), in order to avoid ptrace
to modify the process scheduling (gdb would be intrusive otherwise).
