I assume that init is passed on the kernel command line like
init=/what/ever, right ?
Why not make that INIT=/what/ever, then make this /sbin/init:
main()
{
	execl(getenv("INIT"), getenv("INIT"), "other", "args", NULL);
}
Kernel command line args not reckognized by the kernel get put
into the environment of init ..
