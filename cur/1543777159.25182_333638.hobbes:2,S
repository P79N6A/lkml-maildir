If another kind of I/O error detecting system finds a error before
performing iochk_read(), it can prevents coming iochk_read() from
spending such crazy cycles in have_error() by marking cookie->error.

Isn't it enough?
And as Ben said, it seems that ppc64 can have its own special iochk_*,
unless calling pci_read_config_word() ;-)
