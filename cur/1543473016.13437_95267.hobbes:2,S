I've compiled 2.1.131 and 132 with 3 different compilers, and I get errors
with anything using a socket. Every time I use netscape or lynx to go to a
webpage, I have to go to it twice, just to get it to go. Also, whenever I
try to connect to irc.total.net, it gets as far as:
Connecting to port 6667 of server irc.total.net [refnum 0]
!irc.total.net Looking up your hostname...
!irc.total.net Found your hostname, cached
!irc.total.net Checking Ident
!irc.total.net Got Ident response
And then it just sits there. I can connect to every other server properly,
and I can connect to irc.total.net with 2.0.36 just fine.
Am I doing something wrong, or is there something wrong with the kernel?
Sorry to even post this if it's a known bug. :)
