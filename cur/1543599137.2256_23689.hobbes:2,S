Subject: [PATCH] Possible bug in dequeue_signal()

I had a crash on PPC that I tracked down to be a bug in dequeue_signal()
in kernel/signal.c, and that probably happens on other archs as well.
do_signal() can loop & block. The exit condition of the loop in this case
is when dequeue_signal() returns 0. It continues calling it until that
point, it doesn't re-check current->sigpending.
That means on the second iteration, dequeue_signal() can actually be called
with no pending signal.
A that point, dequeue_signal() calls next_signal() which returns 0. The
problem begins when the current task has a "notifier" installed (which
in my case was done by DRM). If current->notifier is non-null, then we
call sigismember() passing it 0 as the "sig" parameter.
sigismember will then do pointer arithmetic with "sig-1", that is
0xffffffff which will crashes when dereferencing.
The patch is simple:

 		if (sigismember(current->notifier_mask, sig)) {
 			if (!(current->notifier)(current->notifier_data)) {
 				current->sigpending = 0;
(You may want to factor with the other if (sig) that is
done just after that code).
