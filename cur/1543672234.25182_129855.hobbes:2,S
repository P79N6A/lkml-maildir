Cutting boot time in half is pretty good as it is right now.

Perhaps two uptimes could be kept. The current concept of uptime would
remain as is, analogous to the reign of a king (the current kernel), and
a new integrated uptime would be analogous to the life of a dynasty. The
dynasty uptime would be one of the many things the new kernel learned
about on booting. This new dynasty uptime could become quite long if
everything keeps on ticking.
