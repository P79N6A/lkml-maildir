No. If you do that, it shouldn't be an of_device based device.
If you want then to be below a common parent, then create that parent of
a basic struct device type, that sort of thing. You should never
instanciate an of_device that has a NULL device node.
vio is different since it's not a "subclass" of of_device though I tend
to also disagree with the way it does things.
It's a generic problem with sysfs, I agree it somewhat sucks.
Ben.
