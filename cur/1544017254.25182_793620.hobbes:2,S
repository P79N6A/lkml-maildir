The slab queues are a particular problem since they are combined with
timers. So the latency insensitive phase of an HPC app completes and then
the latency critical part starts to run. SLAB will happily every 2 seconds
expire a certain amount of objects from all its various queues.

I agree there is no point in working on theoretical problems. We are
talking about practical problems.

You concentrate on the problems that are given to you I guess...

Of course. I need to repost them? I am no longer employed by the company I
did the work for. So the test data is no longer accessible to me. You have
to rely on the material that was posted in the past.

The per cpu queue size in SLUB is limited by the queues only containing
objects from the same page. If you have large queues like SLAB/SLQB(?)
then this could be an issue.

Well so far it seems that your tests never even exercise that part of the
allocators.

How do they prioritize this?

That means large amounts of memory are going to be caught in these queues.
If its per cpu and one cpu does allocation and the other frees then the
first cpu will consume more and more memory from the page allocator
whereas the second will build up huge per cpu lists.

These are issues that we encountered in practice with large systems.
Pointer chasing performance on many apps is bounded by TLB faults etc.
Strictly obeying NUMA policies causes performance problems in SLAB. Try
MPOL_INTERLEAVE vs a cpu local allocations.

It seems that on SMP systems SLQB will actually increase the number of
queues since it needs 2 queues per cpu instead of the 1 of SLAB. SLAB also
has resizable queues. Code simplification and bootstrap: Great work on
that. Again good cleanup of SLAB.
