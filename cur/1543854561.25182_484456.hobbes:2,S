Hi everyone,
I've been trying to come up with ways to clean up the MMC layer a bit,
and one idea I had was to remove the support for the bus topology. Both
SD and MMC4 have deprecated this design, so I'm suspecting it's not
something that is very popular.
So my question to you is, have you seen any hardware that uses the bus
feature of MMC and do you know if anyone runs Linux on it?
Rgds
