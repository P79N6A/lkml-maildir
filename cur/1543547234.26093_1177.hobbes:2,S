Which is why I'm proposing a solution: to split it into 2 functions.
   1st function does the semaphore manipulations and calls
   2nd function which does the f_count--, nlm_delete_file()...
The second function can be called by any other creature already
holding the semaphore to safely decrement f_count. That way we don't
fill the lockd stuff with loads of different routines that may end up
doing --f_count wrongly (like put_file(file, 0); will do).

Look again. With exception of nlmsvc_proc_null(), every single call to
a nlmsvc_proc_*() routine will do nlmsvc_lookup_file() which does
change f_count.

In any case, the point is we don't want to have loads of different
routines doing the work of nlm_release_file(). That's going to give
rise to unnecessary maintenance issues whenever we want to make
changes.
