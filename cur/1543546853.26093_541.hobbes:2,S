Ok, I'll grant you that some parts of it were crap, and some crap was added in
later drafts.  I'll admit I've lost touch with the details that've been tacked
on since about Draft 4 or so.
I'll also admit signals were always a mess.  They never fit very well with
pthreads, and we pretty much punted in the early drafts.  I added sigwait() to
the original draft as a way an application could direct all its signal handling
to a single synchronous 'signal handler' thread, but it never addressed the
larger question of how to make signals and threads play together.

All of POSIX was a good example of what 'design by committee' really means,
especially when various members of those committees worked for competing
companies with their own agendas.  But on the whole I think we came up with a
decent basic design for what it was, as someone earlier put it... 'thread as
a component of a process' as opposed to Linux's 'thread as a process'.
