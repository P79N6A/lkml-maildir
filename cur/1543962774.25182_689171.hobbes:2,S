This isn't a menu-visible option. Your hint does explain why it turns itself 
on, however:
config MEDIA_TUNER
        tristate
        default DVB_CORE || VIDEO_DEV
        depends on DVB_CORE || VIDEO_DEV
I have DVB_CORE=n and VIDEO_DEV=y. VIDEO_DEV is:
config VIDEO_DEV
        tristate "Video For Linux"
So if you enable Video For Linux, the tuner-core is automatically built, even 
if no tuners are selected? Surely that's wrong..
