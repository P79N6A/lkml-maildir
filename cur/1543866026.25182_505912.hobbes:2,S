Subject: [PATCH 3/6] workqueue: make cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue() work on idle dwork
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/6/403

cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue(dwork) will hang forever if dwork was not
scheduled, because in that case cancel_delayed_work()->del_timer_sync() never
returns true.
I don't know if there are any callers which may have problems, but this is
not so convenient, and the fix is very simple.
Q: looks like we don't need "struct workqueue_struct *wq" parameter. If the
timer was aborted successfully, get_wq_data() == wq. Is it worth to add the
new function?
