That's probably true.  The latency would suck.  But I think if you were in
a situation where the bottom-half thread was continually ready to run
anyway, it might not be so slow.  Anyway, throttling of the bh code was the
main intent of the wacky idea in the first place. :-)

I assumed that kernel threads were scheduled as normal processes, from a
cursory glance at some of the places they are used (init, nfs, kmod).  If
this true only after exec or ?  Where did I go wrong?

Actually, the specific case that caused me to want to try this is
maximum-throughput networking on multiple interfaces.
