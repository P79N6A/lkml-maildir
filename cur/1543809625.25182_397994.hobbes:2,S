This would require a much smarter init, and that a child be nice,
cooperate and pass on what is requested of it if it's nested children
are to be killed.  If a child decided to be mean and ignore its parent's
requests, the parent can always just kill the child.
(Read the last sentence, and in case you're wondering, no I don't have
any children in real life)
