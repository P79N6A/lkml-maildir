Uh... The Maestro3 is integrated on the motherboard, so that's kinda hard.
I have 1 pcmcia card and 1 cardbus card in the system (see below). 
I have tested the booting with no cards, than it boots fine. Booting with only
the pcmcia card also works fine, so It's really the cardbus card that seems to 
throw the system into an unstable state.
