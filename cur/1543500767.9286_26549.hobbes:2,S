Good evening
I am new to that list so I dont'n know if that subject has been answered
before.
I have a box which contain a Cyrix 166+ (133Mhz) with 16 MB RAM, and it
has Red Hat 5.2, upgrated to support 2.2/2.3 kernels. The upgrate
contains everything it is written at Changes file. I get the error
messages which continue, when I'm trying to make modules at kernels
2.3.7 and 2.3.8. (The zImage was build with no errors). They
(2.3.7-2.3.8) use the same configurations file as 2.3.6 kernel but with
that all it's OK. The problem which I get when I make the modules is
that:
    make -C fat modules
    make[2]:Entering directory '/usr/src/linux-2.3.7/fs/fat'
    gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.3.7/include -Wall

    -02 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -DCPU=586
-DMODULE -c

    make[2]:***[file.o] Error 1
    make[2]:Leaving directory '/usr/src/linux-2.3.7/fs/fat'
    make[1]:***[_modsubdir_fat] Error 2
    make[1]:Leaving directory '/usr/src/linux-2.3.7/fs'
    make:***[_mod_fs] Error 2
If I turn off FAT support the modules are compiled OK on both kernels
(2.3.7 &
2.3.8) and all works perfectly exept the fat support.
Thanks for anyone who will answer.
