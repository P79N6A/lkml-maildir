Sorry ... we appear to have several reporters of different bugs in this
thread.  That message was copied by Chuck Ebbert from a Red Hat
bugzilla ... I was assuming it was the same problem.

First off, has this driver ever worked for you in 2.6?  Just booting
SLES9 (2.6.5) or RHEL4 (2.6.9) ... or one of their open equivalents to
check a really old kernel would be helpful.  If you can get it to work,
then we can proceed with a patch reversion regime based on the
assumption that the problem is a recent commit.
