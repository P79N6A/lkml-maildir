Specifically patched kernel? Sounds lame to me...
Generic solution would be to have a generic implementation, IMHO.
Up to now, I've nowhere found some hard facts that the new opcodes do
measureable speed up things. Sure, saving some hundreds/thousands/...
CPU cycles is nice - but not, if that's only 0.1% of the whole number of
CPU cycles burned in a run. That doesn't, IMHO, really legitimate do
unsupport the i386.
