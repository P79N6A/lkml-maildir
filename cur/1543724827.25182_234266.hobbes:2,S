Not asking.  Just suggesting that you make your request to the
compiler clearer.  This may enable the compiler to do a better job for
you.  You don't have to switch it all at once.  Keep inline as
always_inline, if you like, and downgrade other inline requests as you
see fit.
Of course having inline expand to something containing always_inline
will take a bit of preprocessor hackery to get other macros to expand
to the inline keyword without this attribute.

`should not inline' is the default: a function not declared as inline
won't be inlined unless several conditions are met, e.g., compiling
with -O3 and/or -finline-all-functions.  It's the other cases to tune
inlining directives that would be useful.
