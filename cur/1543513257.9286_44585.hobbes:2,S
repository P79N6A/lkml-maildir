   The problems are with the 2.3 kernel.  There isn't a similar change --
   there is a different change that I introduced in 2.3.19 (when Alan was
   babysitting).  This was to not call request_region when the uart type
   was none (as there is no region allocated).
Yeah, you're right..  I got confused since I had already fixed the
problem in my development sources, but which I haven't yet merged back
into the 2.3 tree because my Insane Travel Schedule hasn't allowed me to
test the serial console fixups.
I *think* that problem has been fixed now, since the Puffin Group used a
development version of my driver and got the serial console driver
working on the PA-RISC platform while we were at ALS, but I want to test
it on the intel platform before I send it in.
If folks can do some testing for me, they can find the sources here:

Grab the ALPHA-test sources, and give them a spin.  Let me know how they
work.  :-)

P.S.  There may still be some cases where non-standard UART's are
misdetected by the serial driver, but which worked under the 2.2
kernel.  One of the really frustrating of dealing with the serial driver
is that there's so much broken hardware out there that any time I try to
merge proposed enhancements, or otherwise improve the serial driver, I
have to watch out for breaking trashing knockoff hardware which
unfortunately is flooding the marketplace.   This is true both of
internal modem cards and UART's built into motherboards, unfortunately.
