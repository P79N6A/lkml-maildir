Hi.
I already sent a message with a list of questions about 2.2 networking.
Now it seems I have found a bug:
I have aliased ppp0:1 interface with absolutely different IP number than
parent's ppp0. Both have netmasks 255.255.255.255. ifconfig ppp0:1 down
also removes ppp0, but thats another "feature" and I'm not speaking about
it here.
I was using PPP for about an hour. The default route is setted up using
ppp0 interface. ppp0:1 was just idle at that time and nothing was routed
through it. I did some downloads and then went to eat ;)  When I was back
in about 30-40 minutes I found that no outbound connections worked, though
I was still connected through PPP. I immediately did netstat -nr but
everything seemed to be ok - default route using ppp0, but I remembered
that aliased interfaces do not appear in "route" any more, and ran tcpdump
-i ppp0 -n. To my surprise, I found that all requests were going through
ppp0:1's IP.
Now I remember that I work through a proxy and all my connections were
in fact going to the remote point-to-point host. Anyway, I cured the
trouble using ifconfig down ppp0:1 (which made ppp0 go down as well),
ifconfig up ppp0:1. After this everything worked.
BTW, while I was writing this message the thing happened again.
I have a running gated, in my current configuration it has to do nothing,
but may be there are some changes in 2.2 that make gated read the routing
table from the kernel, somehow corrupt it and insert the wrong entries?
Anyway, if even it can't properly read the routing table, it shouldn't
insert it back because it learned it from the same machine.
