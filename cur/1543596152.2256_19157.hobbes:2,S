I experience the same feature, but not only in Linux.
BeOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD do not turn off the IDE light.
The manual for my main board (GA-6BXDS) sais that the light does not
turn off if no SCSI devices are attached to the board and SCSI is set to
'off' in the BIOS. But even if I turn it on, the light is constantly lit.
If I use a kernel compiled for Pentium (not PII which I really have) the
lamp does turn off sometimes (I mean with some kernels, I don't see any
other regularity).
I'm using a western Digital Caviar disk (WDC AC29100D) for over 2 years
now, and everything but for the light is fine.
