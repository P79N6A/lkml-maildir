I would really prefer not to add per host struct via82xxx_dev,
(making it per hwif and doing extra match in ->init_hwif() is acceptable).
+struct via82cxxx_dev
+{
+	struct pci_dev *pci_dev, *isa_dev;
pci_dev is needed only for /proc/via and I would prefer /proc/via
to vanish because it complicates driver needlessly (could you do
this in separate patch?).
isa_dev has no relevance for vt6410 and won't be needed if
/proc/via goes away
+	struct via_isa_bridge *via_config;
Please instead add via_config_find() which would
find proper via_config given PCI ID.
+	unsigned int via_clock;
Global via_clock is OK as IDE core doesn't
support per bus PCI clocks anyway.
+	unsigned int via_80w;
Cable detection code should be moved to separate function
and be called from ->init_hwif() (required for future hotplug support).
Otherwise patch looks fine.
Thanks and sorry for the delay,
Bartlomiej
