2.6.24-rc7-rt2 (-rt2 patchset on top of Linus's current git commit 
031f2dcd7075e218e74dd7f942ad015cf82dffab) starts to complain like following 
(full dmesg can be found @ [1]) when try to login from console (the other 
acpi related errors also existed in 2.6.24-rc5-rt1) and FYI, plain 2.6.24-rc7 
(again commit 031f2dcd7075e218e74dd7f942ad015cf82dffab) has no issues.

sysfs: duplicate filename 'vcs1' can not be created
WARNING: at fs/sysfs/dir.c:424 sysfs_add_one()
Pid: 1298, comm: mingetty Not tainted 2.6.24-rc7-rt2-99 #1
[...]
And because of mcount-add-basic-support-for-gcc-profiler-instrum.patch, closed 
source nvidia-new module cannot be used with this release (mcount is exported 
GPL only), i know this is not supported but i used it with that [2] patch up 
until now without a single problem. 
Please don't misunderstand this, i really do not want to start a discussion 
for this, i just want to ask the possibility of converting this into 
EXPORT_SYMBOL cause i thought some of the possible -rt users may need this 
closed source module explicitly because of its 3D performance. 
If anything else needed for sysfs warnings please just say it...

Linux is like living in a teepee. No Windows, no Gates and an Apache in house!
