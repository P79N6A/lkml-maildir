yeah, that's the fear - that timing sensitivities or outright races are 
hidden via _p() uses. It's a bit like the BKL - nobody really knows why 
it's still needed in some places but there's "fear" that "stuff might 
break" so removal is very slow. So we should get rid of all _p() uses, 
by either removing them (concluding that the _p() was not needed), or by 
adding in an udelay(2) (documenting that the device indeed relies on the 
delay from the host side) or by adding whatever posting/flushing is 
needed. That will gradually reduce the amount of code that uses _p() 
methods, and will improve the quality of the kernel.
