ctime, actually--the change attribute is also supposed to be updated on
attribute updates.

So the client would be invalidating its cache more often than necessary,
rather than failing to invalidate it when it should.  I agree that
that's probably the better tradeoff, although I wish I had a better idea
of the downside.  I don't know, for example, whether users might see
unpleasant results if every client has to reread its cached data on a
reboot.
The currently proposed change--just providing a model change attribute
implementation for ext4 and leaving other filesystems untouched--is a
more conservative step.
So I'm inclined to just do this ext4 thing first, and then look into
further change attribute experiments next time around....
