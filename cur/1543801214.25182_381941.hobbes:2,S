The reason that I asked is that sched.c:659 looks like this:
static inline void dec_rt_tasks(task_t *p, runqueue_t *rq)
{
#if defined(CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT) && defined(CONFIG_SMP)
	if (rt_task(p)) {
		WARN_ON(!rq->rt_nr_running);
		rq->rt_nr_running--;
		if (rq->rt_nr_running == 1)
			atomic_dec(&rt_overload);
	}
#endif
}
And so that will only get into that path on a SMP configured system. But
although you are not running on an SMP machine, here's what's in
your .config.
CONFIG_SMP=y
CONFIG_NR_CPUS=8
Although this should not bug, and I'm going to try this config on a UP
machine myself to see if I can reproduce your problem, I'd suggest to
you to turn off the SMP configuration.
