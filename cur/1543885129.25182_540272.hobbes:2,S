I had tried this:
-  if (enable_arbiter_disable()) {
+  if (0 && enable_arbiter_disable()) {
to skip enabling the northbridge. Unfortunately, I do not seem to have
southbridge or ACPI support.

I think I did not see any oops, though I (1) did not redirect the
kernel output back to tty0 [the distro moves it away to tty11]
so I might have missed something, but (2) netconsole did not send
anything. IIRC, the kernel still catches sysrq if it paniced, i.e.
as a result of not finding a proper root device during startup;
but no sysrq, so it seems a harder lockup. Maybe I should try
without all the modules loaded and/or disable some hw in the bios.
