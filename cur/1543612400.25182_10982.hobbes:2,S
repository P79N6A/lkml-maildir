And I recently found out the hard way that wasn't enough, and ended up  
cludging a utility to patch a running kernel (don't ask) to increase that  
timeout. Turned out the drive needed a little over three hours to tell me  
it couldn't format.
Frankly, format should really have NO timeout. Or possibly a user- 
specified one.
