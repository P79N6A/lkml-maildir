from my multiple 64/66 PCI bus + multiple 2gbit/s FC HBA tests, yes, 
they're around the same.
(now up to 390mbyte/sec throughput on latest & greatest x86 hardware i 
have; front-side-bus no longer the limiting factor, but dual 64/66 PCI).
of course, purely synthetic tests designed to stress Fibre Channel 
switching infrastructure, not real-world disk i/o..
cheers,
lincoln.
