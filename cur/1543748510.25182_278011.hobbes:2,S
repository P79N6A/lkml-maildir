Your suggestion adds duplicate information. This solution is worse than the
thing you're trying to fix.
Do we really need both the file-mmu-n and file-mmu- variants?
Actually, this would probably do instead:
	file-mmu-y := file-nommu.o
	file-mmu-$(CONFIG_MMU) := file-mmu.o
	ramfs-objs := inode.o file-mmu-y
Will this work? Or should it be $(file-mmu-y) on the last line?
