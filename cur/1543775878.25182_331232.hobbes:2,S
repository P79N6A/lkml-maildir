It was whatever was Al Viro's (technical) complaint about file-as-dir.
I don't remember exactly what it was.  The technical people know what it
is (and the Namesys guys are probably working on it), and the exact
issue doesn't concern us non-technical people that much, so I don't feel
like looking it up.  But if you want to, just look for Al Viro's message
in this thread.
