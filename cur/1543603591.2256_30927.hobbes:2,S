Here's what each developer was equipped with at my former place of
employment, back when they had money and all:
Two x86 machines, one workstation and one "blow up box".
Console on serial port, minicom logging to a file.
/usr/src on the "blow up box" nfs-mounted from workstation; 100MBit
ethernet
Used kdb sometimes.
