Yes, I thought it's so rare we can wait till 2.6.29, while you had this
patched, and Denys seemed to not see it after changing his sever. But
I have changed my mind after seeing Chris's report...
I'm not sure if Peter would recomend something better yet, so I guess
you could wait with this testing for his opinion.
Thanks,
