It is if you know the magic incantation for System.map.

I've never been sure what 'make install' does, or what it might do in the 
future.  I've always just installed according to the README.  After doing 
this by hand way too many times, and having ferretted out the truth about 
System.map, I wrote the following bash script:
   here=`pwd`
   kernel=`basename $here`
   make modules_install >/dev/null
   cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/bzImage-$kernel
   cp System.map /boot/System.map-$kernel
   cp .config /boot/config-$kernel
   lilo
I put it in /usr/src and use it as follows:
  cd /usr/src/linux-xx.xx.xx
  sudo ../install
This does everything you need, with the exception of editing lilo.conf.  Note 
that the name of the top level directory is the name of the install, so you 
would probably not want to do 'cd /usr/src/linux' where linux is a symlink.
This is x86-specific, obviously.
