Yes, I spent almost 2 months trying random 2.3 versions, and only
found this while suspecting bad memory, and booting the machine with
8MB, which resulted in an instant crash, while it would only crash
under heavy load with 96MB...

Here's the patch I sent to LKML back in december. I've been told by
Nathan Zook to forget about this, since there was a better (and much
more complete) memory detection patch under way. Alas, such patch
hasn't made it into the kernel yet, and a whole range of systems is
currently left in the dust for 2.4, at least without adding the
mem=xxx option, which was not exactly easy to guess...
