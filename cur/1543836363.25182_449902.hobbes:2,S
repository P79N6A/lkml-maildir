Whilst this is a quick fix for users who either know how to hack DSDTs
themselves, or know where to get a fixed one, it doesn't solve the bigger
problem, that the interpretor doesn't get fixed.
And by 'fixed', I mean we aren't bug for bug compatible with that
other OS.  We need to be adding workarounds to the ACPI interpretor
so this stuff 'just works', not hiding from the problem and creating
"but it works in $otherdistro when I do this" scenarios.
