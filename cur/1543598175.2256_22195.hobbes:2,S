Be careful, I tested by using _clone() dircetly and let a proc A
create two clones B and C.  I then let A die, and B &C's ppid was now 1.
Attaching this code, you may find it useful for your tgid patch.
(this code is pretty unclean, ran into the problem that if A cloned B
and B cloned C, and now B died B remained a zombie and I didn't seem to
be able to catch SIGCHLD in A. (wanted to se C's ppid go to 1), probably
something stupid, just didn't bother to pursue it....)
THeory is correct if every one is using pthreads...
(exactly how many thread libs are ut there.....??)

attached program ;-)
Maybe not, but *the kernel allows it*!

Looking forward to it!
