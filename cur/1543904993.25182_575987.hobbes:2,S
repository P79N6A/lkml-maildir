Subject: [rfc] direct IO submission and completion scalability issues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

We have been looking into the linux kernel direct IO scalability issues with
database workloads. Comments and suggestions on our below experiments are
welcome.
In the linux kernel, direct IO requests are not batched at the block layer.
i.e, as a new request comes in, the request get directly submitted to the
IO controller on the same cpu that the request originates. And the IO completion
likely happens on a different cpu which is processing interrupts. This results
in cacheline bouncing of some of the hot kernel cachelines (like timers, scsi
cmds, slab, sched, etc) and is becoming an important scalability issue
as the number of cpus and distance between them increase with multi-core
and numa.
In case of the controllers which support RIO/ZIO modes (like some qla2xxx),
IO submission path on each cpu also checks if there any completed
IO commands in the response queue and triggers softirq on the same cpu
to process the completed commands. This results in each logical cpu in the
system spending sometime in softirq processing and this causes contentions in
spinlocks and other data structures.
Not sure when the IO controllers with multiple request/response queues will be
available in the market. In that case we can dedicate each queue pair 
to group of cpus(/a node)  and be done with this problem.
In the absence of such HW today, we were looking into possible solutions for
these problemsa and did couple of experiments as part of this.
In the first experiment, we removed the completed IO command processing during
IO submission. This will now result in the processing of IO commands only
on the cpu receiving interrupts. This will result in more interrupts
(as we are not doing any proactive processing) but wanted to see if this is a
win over each cpu doing the softirq processing. This gave a 1.36% performance
improvement on a x86_64 MP system (total 16 logical cpus) and on two
node ia64 platform(2 nodes, 8 cores, 16 threads) we got 1.5% improvement
[please look at observation #1 below].

Observation #1: This experiment puts heavy load on the cpu processing
interrupts. As such, equal distribution of task load by the scheduler didn't
give expected performance improvement(as cpu's with no interrupts race to idle
and migrate some tasks during idle balance, leading to some increase in idle
time aswell as costs associated with excessive task migration). We tweaked our
manual task binding so that cpu's with no interrupts get proportionally more
load compared to cpu's which process interrupts and this gave a nice performance
boost as mentioned above. Perhaps, we need to make the scheduler load balancing
aware of the irq load on that cpu.
Second experiment which we did was migrating the IO submission to the
IO completion cpu. Instead of submitting the IO on the same cpu where the
request arrived, in this experiment  the IO submission gets migrated to the
cpu that is processing IO completions(interrupt). This will minimize the
access to remote cachelines (that happens in timers, slab, scsi layers). The
IO submission request is forwarded to the kblockd thread on the cpu receiving
the interrupts. As part of this, we also made kblockd thread on each cpu as the
highest priority thread, so that IO gets submitted as soon as possible on the
interrupt cpu with out any delay. On x86_64 SMP platform with 16 cores, this
resulted in 2% performance improvement and 3.3% improvement on two node ia64
platform.
Quick and dirty prototype patch(not meant for inclusion) for this io migration
experiment is appended to this e-mail.
Observation #1 mentioned above is also applicable to this experiment. CPU's
processing interrupts will now have to cater IO submission/processing
load aswell.
Observation #2: This introduces some migration overhead during IO submission.
With the current prototype, every incoming IO request results in an IPI and
context switch(to kblockd thread) on the interrupt processing cpu.
This issue needs to be addressed and main challenge to address is
the efficient mechanism of doing this IO migration(how much batching to do and
when to send the migrate request?), so that we don't delay the IO much and at
the same point, don't cause much overhead during migration.
Source of the IO migration experiment came from an old experiment done in EL3
days (linux-2.4.21-scsi-affine-queue.patch in EL3 GA release, pointed
by Arjan).  Arjan pointed out that this patch had some perf issues
and was taken out in a later update release of EL3. Given that 2.6 has
progressed quite a bit from 2.4 days, wondering if we can answer this
challenge easily with today's infrastructure.
Experiment - 1 above can be easily incorporated in to linux kernel(by
doing the proactive IO cmd completion processing only on cpu processing
the interrupts) . We need to address the scheduler load balancing issue
(of taking irq load in to account) though.
Is there a simple and better way to efficiently migrate the IO request(perhaps
only for direct IO and also based on IO load -- similar to what is pursued
in EL3)? Efficient IO migration will further improve the performance
numbers stated above.
io migration prototype(and really dirty) patch follows:
