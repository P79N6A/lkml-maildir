What?  Perhaps we're talking at cross-prorposes here.  What I'm proposing
is that /proc/dmi should be a world-readable /proc file with the property
that 
	cat /proc/dmi
gives you a DMI report.  No root privileges or SUID programs needed.
Surely that would be an improvement on having to run Arjan's dmidecode as
root or requiring it to be SUID.
