 I really mean *commodity* -- I haven't seen a single DOS installation for 
a few years now.  For specialized uses special hardware can be used.  
Add-on boards with a PCI-ISA bridge and ISA slots do also exist for this 
very reason; well, I have even seen USB-ISA "bridges".

 Well, keyboard and mouse are USB these days, serial and parallel are PCI, 
floppies are not used anymore and the ISA DMA controller would only be 
needed for them.  Video?  I've thought ISA implementations are gone -- 
what is all that AGP/PCI-E noise about then?  And no more ISA slots 
either.
 Other objects?  Do you mean the pre-i486 FPU error or the A20 line 
latches?  They are not really needed either, are they?  There's some NMI 
logic, though, which hasn't been moved elsewhere, indeed.  I think it 
really belongs to the PCI configuration space somewhere -- probably I/O 
APICs or host bridges.
 Of course if a manufacturer wants to put all the legacy in their system, 
it's their choice, but there is no need anymore.

 Certainly we do and we will do for the forseeable future.

 That is what surprises me and what my whole consideration is about.  
It's just I don't see a need for such a setup anymore and for a system 
with no ISA or EISA bridge I'd expect all that legacy to be gone leaving 
us with no need to handle implicit resources.  But has any manufacturer 
produced such an i386 system yet?
