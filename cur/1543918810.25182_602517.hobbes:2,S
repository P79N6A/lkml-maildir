I'm reluctant to right now, because I will be off the air
for three days, starting in one more day, and don't like
firing off stuff just before I vanish.
Though I'm aware that time is short for 2.6.24 ... not
sure how best to handle this.
My plan had been to send Andrew something on Wednesday
next week (five days from now), either what we have now,
or with the improved cpuset-to-sched API, if Nick and I
can work through that (well, if Nick can figure out what
I broke, while I'm offline.)
Andrew or Ingo - you got any better plan?
