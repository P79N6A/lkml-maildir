	The persistance that devfsd adds is, as I recall, less than elegant.
A better solution would be nice, almost like a special kind of symlink,
perhaps even something created by mknod which uses a major,minor assigned to
it that is basically just 'talk to devfs', which will then figure out what
device to talk to in /devices.  
	Now, how you figure out what device to talk to is something of a 
kicker.  You don't want it based on file name, nor do you (obviously) want 
it based on major,minor (You want to have just ONE major,minor to talk 
through, if possible).  What this would do, basically, is allow for persistance
in /dev using these files (For those who want it), and have the permissions
on these files be handled when they're initally opened, as things work now.
	My comment above regarding having /devices populated w/ major,minor
as my idea as to the possible solution for those who feel using names is
putting policy into the kernel.  So we give the option to not use names, and
at the same time allow those of us who like the devfs naming conventions to
use them.  Of course, with the idea of the links I'm talking about, you could
name things in /dev whatever you felt like, but then, that solution may not
be possible, or may not just be a solution at all.

	That would be the problem, and the devfs mount goes away when you reboot,
I realize devfsd does something to handle (tarball-like I seem to recall?), but
that seems less than elegant to me...
	Realize, I like devfs as it is personally, but I want to see it in the
main kernel tree and this is why I'm trying to come up w/ ideas that will (maybe)
help satisfy others and convince them to let it be put in...
