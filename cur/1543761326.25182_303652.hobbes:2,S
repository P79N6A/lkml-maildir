The oom-killer tries to be nicer to processes which are running as root.

Some application went berzerk, used up all the swap and then oomed the box.
You could perhaps run `top -d1' then hit M so the output is sorted by
bloatiness, then try to catch the culprit.
But it would be better to have some app which prints the N most
memory-hungry processes every second and simply scrolls that up the screen. 
I'm not aware of such a thing, but it could be cooked up via
/proc/N/cmdline and /proc/N/statm.
