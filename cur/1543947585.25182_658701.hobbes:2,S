After applying the patch and continuing with the same randconfig
reported earlier, the build fails with following error
drivers/acpi/thermal.c: In function ‘acpi_thermal_init’:
drivers/acpi/thermal.c:1792: error: ‘thermal_dmi_table’ undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/acpi/thermal.c:1792: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/acpi/thermal.c:1792: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [drivers/acpi/thermal.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/acpi] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
I have tested the patch for build failure only.
