   Why ? A VCC is more like a network interface than a TCP
   connection.
   
It's more like an IP tunnel and a route, granted.  And those are
similarly configured, and to me the same rules apply.
   
   Removing an ATM device while there are open VCCs isn't a lot
   more useful than removing a telephone while there is still a
   call in progress :-)
   
It's like rmmod'ing TCP while you have TCP connections.
And it's like unregistering IP tunnels while you still have
routes going over them, the routes just get deleted.
And frankly I see absolutely NOTHING wrong with doing these
sorts of things.
