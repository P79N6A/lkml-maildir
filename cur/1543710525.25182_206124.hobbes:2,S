Ahh... would you consider moving that up one level, or spelling it
"Series" or "00series" or something to make it stand out for the
uninitiated??

Looks like it might be a good guess....
I cannot reach the reset button on the weekend, so I wrote a little
boot-time script which would apply the next patch, mail me, recompile,
install, and reboot.
It got up to stop-using-dirty-pages.patch and died because of the
spin_unlock in mm/page.c - I left SPINLOCK_DEBUG configured :-(
But that only leaves
   235  stop-using-io-pages.patch
   236  stop-using-locked-pages.patch
   237  stop-using-clean-pages.patch
   238  unslabify-pgds-and-pmds.patch
   239  slab-stop-using-page-list.patch
   240  page_alloc-stop-using-page-list.patch
   241  hugetlb-stop-using-page-list.patch
   242  pageattr-stop-using-page-list.patch
   243  readahead-stop-using-page-list.patch
   244  compound-pages-stop-using-lru.patch
   245  remove-page-list.patch
   246  remap-file-pages-prot-2.6.4-rc1-mm1-A1.patch
   247  remap-file-pages-prot-ia64-2.6.4-rc2-mm1-A0.patch
   248  list_del-debug.patch
   249  oops-dump-preceding-code.patch
   250  lockmeter.patch
   251  lockmeter-ia64-fix.patch
   252  4g-2.6.0-test2-mm2-A5.patch
   253  4g4g-locked-userspace-copy.patch
   254  ia32-4k-stacks.patch
   255  ia32-4k-stacks-build-fix.patch
   256  4k-stacks-in-modversions-magic.patch
   257  ppc-fixes.patch
   258  ppc-fixes-dependency-fix.patch
of which, the 4g and the 4k-stack patches look most likely.
I'll finish the hunt when I get back to the office.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
