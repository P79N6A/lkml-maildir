Depends who you talk to. It's certainly the fodder for a yearly flamewar.
While I'm not trying to set you up for a firing squad, if you can show
that the only use this driver has is as underlying support for Acer/HP
xyz drivers, and that those drivers require this one, then that
situation really is what select is in there for. Anyone who argues
against using select in that case is really just arguing against the
mere existence of the kconfig select keyword itself.
