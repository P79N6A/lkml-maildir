i've uploaded the -P7 patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.8.1-P7
Changes since -P6:
- fixed the XFree86/X.org context-switch latency. (let me know if you
  see any weirdness like X not starting up while it did before.)
- halved the pagevec size, to reduce the radix gang-lookup costs.
