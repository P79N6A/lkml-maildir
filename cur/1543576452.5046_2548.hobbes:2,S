Hmm, for some unusual definition of "easy", perhaps ...
For an ugly hack that works remarkably well, look at ptable.c in Andrew
Tridgell's capture program: 
http://samba.org/picturebook/
Note: you probably also want to check if you find multiple addresses
for the page, i.e. if the hack didn't quite work. (Due to odd
side-effects, incomplete address decoding, etc.)
