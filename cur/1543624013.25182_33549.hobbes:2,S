   Ahh.. indeed, changing the burst size to 64 bytes (from the default 128)  
   makes a big difference on my ultra5, thanks for the hint. Does it make any
   sense to differentiate between platforms, or is 64 a good all-around
   value?
Jeff and I want to add some pci_optimal_burst_size() or whatever
interface so that drivers don't get stuffed with ifdefs, but for now
use CONFIG_SPARC64 for this :-) I think on Alpha a similar situation
exists and you should use 128 instead of 64 there.
Franks a lot,
