Only for the ones that do not actually use the module_device_table,
which is an unusual case.
Adam Richter(sp?) went through and added PCI module_device_tables to
drivers which do not use the PCI API.  From the programmer's standpoint
this looks like dead code -- but it's actually very useful, because it
exports the PCI ids to userspace in
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.pcimap, where installers, hardware
configurators, and other tools pick up the data and do something useful
with it.
