This is a RedHat issue.  You can find some info on
http://people.redhat.com/tcallawa/dpt/
 .  We will have the official drivers
posted on our web site in a few days.  2.2.14 should not have this issue.
If it does disable the i2o subsystem and make sure our driver is enable
under Low level scsi drivers->Adaptec I2O RAID.
