Hi All,
     I am Implementing MIB-II( rfc-1213) on Linux. All these API's are kept 
under kernel. my questions is how can I get speed of the Ethernet 
INTERFACE. i get "net_device" structure and "pci_device" structure for 
Interface. but No information about Speed of Interface in that structure's. 
Any help would be highly appreciated.
Regards
KVVNR
