I recently upgraded my laptop to 2.6.11.3 and removed the notsc boot
option I added a fairly long time ago to see if things worked properly
without it now. It seems to work, except that after a resume I get
an awful lot of these messages:
Mar 15 09:53:04 typhoon kernel: rtc: lost some interrupts at 1024Hz.
Mar 15 09:53:06 typhoon last message repeated 103 times
and indeed looking at /proc/interrupts interrupt 8 is not getting hit.
