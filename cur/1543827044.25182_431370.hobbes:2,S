The question is, do you
a) expect users to run this magic command, and DTRT or
b) watch users boot w/ extents, accidentally do something silly like 
writing data to a file, and become locked into a new subset of kernels?
The simple act of writing data to a file has become an _irrevocable 
filesystem upgrade event_.
