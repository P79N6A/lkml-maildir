Not for stuff like CFLAGS_raid6altivec1.o := -maltivec -mabi-altivec
Stuff which is _purely_ #defines, such as...
	ncr53c8xx-flags-$(CONFIG_SCSI_ZALON) \
	                := -DCONFIG_NCR53C8XX_PREFETCH -DSCSI_NCR_BIG_ENDIAN \
	                        -DCONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_NO_WORD_TRANSFERS
	CFLAGS_ncr53c8xx.o      := $(ncr53c8xx-flags-y) $(ncr53c8xx-flags-m)
... can probably be done differently anyway.
It's not entirely unreasonable to treat files with their own CFLAGS just
as we have to treat .S files -- compile them separately, then link.
