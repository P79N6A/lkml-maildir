There are at least two patches in 2.6.19-rc5-mm2 that make my system much more responsive for 
interactive jobs. The one that has the majority of the effect is:
radix-tree-rcu-lockless-readside.patch
I have not been able to isolate the second patch, which has the lesser effect. All I can say is that 
it occurred before the above patch in patches/series. This patch was tested against 2.6.19 and fixed 
most of the problem on that version.
