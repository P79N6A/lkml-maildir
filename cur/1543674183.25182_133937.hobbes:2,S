Maybe I don't spend all my time watching the futex API? :)  Okay,
let's make a deal, you add a new syscall for this case and I'll fix
up the older ones in a patch that's ontop of yours?

Sorry if the question wasn't clear, but who guarantess that the alignment
of u32 is the same as it's size?  You test of the size of u32, not it's
alignment even if they usually are the same.
