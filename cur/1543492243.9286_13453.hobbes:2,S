What occurs with all the right goodies set up is that the X server calls
VIDIOCSFBUF to pass the physical frame buffer address.

That is so you can pass virtual frame buffer bases - which some ports need.
It isnt used for capturing by applications. And you'll note VIDIOCSFBUF
is root only, while MMAP and VIDIOCMCAPTURE are not
