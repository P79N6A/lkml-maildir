I came across this description:
config IRQBALANCE
 	bool "Enable kernel irq balancing"
	depends on SMP && X86_IO_APIC
	default y
	help
 	  The default yes will allow the kernel to do irq load balancing.
	  Saying no will keep the kernel from doing irq load balancing.
Holy shades of preempt!  Help messages should describe the advantages
and disadvantages of an option: little more disclosure would really help
here.
IMHO, if you're having trouble describing the pros and cons of an option
to a user of average technical ability (think sysadmin), it's not a good
config option.
