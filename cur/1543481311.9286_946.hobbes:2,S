Hello,
Alan seems to have rearanged the PCI probing and the eth0/eth1 ordering
is correct now.  However, I think
that something got lost in transit though.  My second ethernet card
doesn't seem to be picked up completely.  It's listed in /proc/ioports
but not in /proc/interupts.  As it is now it's not functional with the
2.2.0-pre9 kernel.  That's the card I use with my cablemodem.
I should mention that one card is a pci-ne2k and the other a tulip
card.  The tulip card is the one giving me problems.
Cheers, Luc.
