That sounds like a non starter. What if the box is busy, what if the
daemon or something you touch needs memory and causes paging ?
Given the accelerometer data should be very simple doesn't it actually
make sense in this specific case to put the logic (not thresholds) in
kernel space.

Yep. Pity the worst case completion time for an IDE I/O is 60 seconds or
so.

I think it has to be kernel side for speed, and because you will need to
issue idle immediate while a command sequence is active which is
*extremely* hairy as you have to recover from the mess and restart the
relevant I/O. Plus you may need controller specific knowledge on issuing
it (and changes to libata).

Idle immediate seem to simply fit the queue model, it happens in
*parallel* to I/O events and is special in all sorts of ways.
