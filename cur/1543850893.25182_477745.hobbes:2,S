Subject: Older TimeSys RT extensions to Linux 2.4 now available under GPL
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The modules implementing the old TimeSys real-time extensions to Linux 2.4
are now available from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/timesysgpl
 as part
of package timesysgpl.
We do not view this code as a contemporary technical contribution per se,
but we recognize that many people have an historical interest in the
internals of these extensions.
