The kernel should allow access to only a specific device (eg the
cd-recorder). accesses to other devices sould be blocked by the kernel
(in the kernel-setup you have to give a list of BUS/ID/LUN-Komponents
the kernel should allow to control by software OR you have an external
software, which tells the kernel which device may be accessed by using
general scsi-interface).
This feature should make roasting a cd less unsecure and we may think
about a non-root cd-record.
