	That is foolish,  in fact I think the BZ2 at this point
	is foolish thing to do as the only compression algorithm.
	In case of ftp.kernel.org archive:
		gz	2.4 GB
		bz2	2.1 GB
	That is, the 'bz2' version of compression is only about
	1/8:th denser, than gzip.
	Way back when the BSD compress got into trouble with
	LZW patents, the rapid move to GNU-zip was well founded,
	but now such a thing is not really warranted.
	Over the time there have been available other free high-
	density compression algorithms (LHA, ARJ), which have not
	gotten very wide adoptation.  Mainly perhaps because while
	they often produce denser results than GZIP, they always
	do it with way more heavy CPU usage.  Also the expansion-
	algorithms of those seem to be heavier than gunzip.
	This thinking is basis on why  ftp.funet.fi  does not
	mirror BZ2 files if the same files are also available
	as GZ files.

  Yeah, the  
http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/
  COULD be further divided
down per what the sites have announced to mirror, e.g.:
	ftp-gz.xx.kernel.org
	ftp-bz2.xx.kernel.org
	www-gz.xx.kernel.org
	www-bz2.xx.kernel.org
if the site has both formats, then it should be aliased both ways.
