Hi,
the following patches (updated from yesterday) attempt to fix some
issues in the current device probing code:
[1/4] Don't stop probing on ->probe errors.
[2/4] Change function call order in device_bind_driver().
[3/4] Per-subsystem multithreaded probing.
[4/4] Don't fail attaching the device if it cannot be bound.
Patches 1 and 3 incorporate some comments I received (thanks to the
reviewers). Patch 4 comes out of the discussion and tries to handle
devices with and without dev->driver set more consistently.
