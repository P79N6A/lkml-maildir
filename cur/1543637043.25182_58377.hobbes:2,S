I REALLY have a problem with this abstraction for cli.  I
think it just makes the code hard to read...

But schedule and signal code does return with interrupts
enabled, so a cli is still needed here.  Also at least some
of the trap code returns with interrupts enabled.

This is really a bug and a fix is on the way.  Turning
interrupts off MUST disable preemption, but trying to
preempt from this state is so rare that the test will be in
preempt_schedule() rather than inline or an attempt to put
disable/enable code along with each cli/sti.
