Sounds like people who can't get customers calling foul to the one
that can.

I would label it "seriously exaggerated fact to obtain market share".

"Real-time limitations" *are* the #1 show-stopper for using Linux. This
isn't an argument for or against your point.

Actually, it looked like he was just presenting a fact. Most people that
say they need RT, don't, and the few that do, do not tend to mind patents.

Most companies with serious RT requirements do not wish to re-write
and distribute 'as they like'. In fact, the only reason they have to
do this now, is because the tools are not mature enough.
The problem here is obviously open-source companies that prefer to
avoid paying for software, because they do not sell software, and
companies that sell software, and do not mind paying for software to
sell software.
The fact is, patents are legal. Live with it, or convince a few
senators that they should remove 'patent infringement' from the set of
actions that can be tried in a court of law.
You are not getting anywhere here.
