There is a lot of interest from the HPC community for this sort of thing
on NFS. Basically, it will help server scalability for projects that
have large numbers of read-only files accessed by large numbers of
clients.
AFAIK, Steve Dickson (steved@redhat.com) is working on the NFS hooks for
FS-Cache.
