Uhmmm... Maybe there is an easier way.
block->b_daemon will always be nlmsvc_serv, so can we simply make this
	svc_wake_up(nlmsvc_serv);
with a little locking to make sure nlmsvc_serv is valid?
Actually svc_wake_up is only called from lockd and goes through
various hoops to find the right rqstp, which we could have known in
advance.
So store the rqstp in some global wrapped in a spinlock so we can
access it safely and just:
   spin_lock(whatever)
   if (nlmsvc_rqstp)
	wake_up(&nlmsvc_rqstp->rq_wait)
   spin_unlock(whatever)
That seems a somewhat simpler way of avoiding the particular problem.
Hmmm.... I guess that nlmsvc_grant_callback could then be run after
the 'lockd' module had been unloaded.
Maybe nlm_shutdown_hosts could call rpc_killall_tasks(host->h_rpcclnt)
on each host.  That should ensure the callback wont happen afterwards.
Maybe?
