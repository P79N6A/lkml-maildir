Aaargh! We just did the same thing today... We do pretty much the same
thing you do, but we moved the call to minix_partition() down, into a new
for loop. That way, the minix minors will be allocated above any existing
extended partition. Many people expect the partitions inside the extended
partition to start at minor 5.
Our setup has:
/dev/hda1 - DOS
/dev/hda2 - Minix
/dev/hda3 - Minix test (for hacking around, this is for an undergraduate
            OS lab assignment)
/dev/hda4 - Extended partition
/dev/hda5 - Linux swap
/dev/hda6 - Linux native
Both Minix partitions have "a" and "c" subpartitions. With your patch,
they would end up as hda5 thru hda8, and Linux would suddenly be on
/dev/hda10.
Personally, I think the BSD Disklabel, Solaris slices, and other foreign
partition types should also be in this second for loop.
Our patch works well over here, too. I'll try yours tomorrow.
Y.T.,
