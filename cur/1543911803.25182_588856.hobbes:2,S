Now that I'm looking at the kernel bugzilla .. If you set the kernel
version to 2.6.22 and set the "Regression" check box you could denote
the fact that it's a regression in that kernel version ..
I don't know if this URL is going to come out right,
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&tree=Mainline&long_desc_type=substring&long_desc=&kernel_version_type=allwordssubstr&kernel_version=2.6.22&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=ASSIGNED&emailassigned_to1=1&emailtype1=substring&email1=&emailassigned_to2=1&emailreporter2=1&emailcc2=1&emailtype2=substring&email2=&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&regression=include&cmdtype=doit&order=Reuse
+same+sort+as+last+time&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=
That should be open bugs , kernel version 2.6.22, with the regression
check box set ..
So you may not need a master tracking bug ..
