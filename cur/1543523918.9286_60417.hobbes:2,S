Actually, that is...
	224-239		Class D		Multicasting
	240-255		Class E		Experimental (reserved)
Also, network 127 is reserved for host-local addressing.
These days, the class A/B/C distinction is academic, although the
numbering authorities still assign blocks out of the A, B or C ranges
roughly depending on block size.  The cutoffs seem to be somewhere
around /10 or /11 and /16.
