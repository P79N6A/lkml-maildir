It may be worthwhile to remind people that it is easy to use systemtap
only to the extent of automating the placement of kprobes: just to
perform the function-name/source-file/line-number triplet to PC
mapping.  They can use embedded-C code to do all the same stuff they'd
do with kprobes.  They are not obligated to write any odd script code
for probing logic, nor indeed use any of this really wrong runtime.

Indeed, and we too try to make this simple & fast: a couple of lines.

But at some point, some interface needs to be fixed for a final
user-space tool.  Whether that interface fixing is performed by kernel
developers being more reluctant to rewrite basic things, or by
providing a proc interface, or maintaining a kprobes module does not
matter.  Someone will feel constrained, and someone will be liberated.
One neat thing about our systemtap tool is that, no matter what layer
such interfaces become fixed within, it can probably interface to
them.  If there is no fixed interface, it can go down to debugging
info.  If there are tracing hooks present, it can attach.  It can make
appear as unified the disparate standardization policies of different
subsystems.

I don't know if that should be treated a compliment to our team, for
being able to work quickly on something that a full-grown kernel
developer finds bloody complicated.  Perhaps your information is
simply outdated.  Big & bloated?  We have several times asked for
specifics rather than smears - what about it?

That's begging the question.  If kernel folks are willing to maintain
some included systemtap-related code, then by definition it would not
break all the time.
