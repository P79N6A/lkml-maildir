I've been placing things in /opt/package/version for quite a while.  I
use a perl script to set the *PATH environment variables to point at
whatever versions I choose for each package.  I patched aclocal (of
automake) to search in directories given by $ACLOCAL_PATH, but the
patch has been ignored for several years, so I'm not expecting it to
be picked up.
