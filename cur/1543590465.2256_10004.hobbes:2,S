I suggested the removal of I_DIRTY_PAGES check because the current
behaviour of munmap seems to be synchronous (1), so I guess you _always_
want it to be synchronous.
1) nfs_wb_file() flushes the dirty data and then waits for completion. 
Trond?

Looks sane and will probably makes things faster.
Again, Trond? :)
