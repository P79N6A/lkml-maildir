That's quite amusingly erroneous. The idea that you could use the Linux
kernel having stripped out all code belonging to Alan so that his
opinion is not relevant is one that I find frankly hilarious.
This is not about your work just being a derived work of Alan's under
copyright law. This is about you not complying to the licence under
which Alan's code is released and hence it is _his_ code, including I
believe a significant part of the networking code, which is an
'infringing copy of a copyright work' in law; since you use it without
licence.
