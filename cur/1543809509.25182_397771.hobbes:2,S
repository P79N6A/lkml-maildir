I think you mean "fried", which is what happens when something is heated 
to excess.  "fired" is what happens to you when your boss catches you 
stealing office supplies or sleeping with his daughter.  It is also what 
happens to the bullet when you pull the trigger.

I assume the drive was no longer under warranty?  It certainly should 
not have burned itself out like that, but yea, the kernel should not 
keep trying to readahead on error.  I ran into a similar problem where I 
mounted a filesystem on a cdrw read/write and wrote some files to it. 
When I went to unmount it all the writes failed because the media was 
not properly formatted to be writable.  The kernel kept trying to write 
each sector though, and blocked the umount process in the unkillable D 
state for a good 20 minutes and kept the drive door locked.  Needless to 
say, I was very annoyed.
