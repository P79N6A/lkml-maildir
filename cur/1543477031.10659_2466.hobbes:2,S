  We already do it, although via only *one* relay.
  That one happens to handle also .UK, but that
  is minor detail..

  Here are number of addresses per top-level domains in all of
  VGER's lists, and systems handling them: (top 8 only)
   8108 com	-->	listserv.funet.fi
   4434 net	-->	listserv.funet.fi
   2583 de	-->	ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk
   2455 edu	-->	entropy.muc.muohio.edu
   1216 uk	-->	ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk
   1137 org	-->	listserv.funet.fi
    909 au	-->	samba.anu.edu.au
    688 it	-->	nic.funet.fi
   ...
  nic.funet.fi  used to handle entire europe, and former soviet union
  a year ago, but then FTP feed popularity forced us to move some of
  email load out of it..  (It got more RAM, and now it could again
  handle the increased ftp and email loads..)
  Feeding .DE to a German exploder would be fine, but could somebody
  please volunteer for .COM or .NET ?   It is pure madness to push the
  load to Finland, and then final delivery back to USA as very likely
  most users at those top-level domains are in USA.  My MTA software
  can handle it, but the machine must be good!
