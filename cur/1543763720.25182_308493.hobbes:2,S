Thanks. yes, a reschedule may not take place after a ms, if the currently 
running task cannot be preempted by another task.
(1) But, can a reschedule happen within a millisec (or once a process is 
scheduled can schedule() be called before the next millisec.) ?
2) Also in case argument (1) is not true, and I want rescheduling to be done 
(i.e., schedule() called) in less than 1 ms , can I directly change the HZ 
value in <asm-i386/param.h> and recompile my kernel so that my timer 
interrupt will occur frequently?
Thanks
Arun
