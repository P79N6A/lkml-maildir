Would it be possible to have something in the module itself?  i.e. We create
a new macro to add info that a script can use.  This info could live in a new file 
in lib/modules or in the actual module.  This could be used to create the static 
setup dynamicly.
This item keeps coming up as the one feature that devfs has and udev 
does not.  It keeps getting dismissed.  Users seem to actually want it...
