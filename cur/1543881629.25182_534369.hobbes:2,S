There is no support to handle an IOMMU hotplug at this time. IOMMU hotplug
requires additional support via ACPI that needs to be extended to handle this.
These definitions are scanned at boot time from BIOS tables. They are
pretty much static data that we process during boot. Hence no locking is 
required. We pretty much tread this as read only, and the information never 
gets changed after initial parsing.
