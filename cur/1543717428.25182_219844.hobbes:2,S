When I setup shaper with CBQ, I found the shaper does not limit traffic for
first two packets. I turned on tcpdump to monitor traffic through Linux
shaper and found that receiver side almost always gets 2 packets at same
time and then gets other packets based on bandwidth and rate setting of CBQ.
I tried maxburst = 1512, minburst = 1512 and they did not work out (1512 is
MTU value).
Could you give me a hint to solve this problem?
Thanks
Fan
