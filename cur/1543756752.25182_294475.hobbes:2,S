I think you are talking about the API for root to administer it vs. the
(lack of) API for apps to use the RT capabilities.  I think Paul's point
is that we can transparently replace it with something better (IMO the
RT rlimit is better) in the future, and the apps don't have to know
about it at all.  Comparing it to devfs/udev is bogus because those are
way, way more complicated.

Sorry, if the distros are so dumb they need a big fat warning to know
that this is not a safe thing to enable by default, at least on anything
you would ever consider a multiuser system, then they get what they
deserve.  If they have half a brain they will use the setgid approach
that Ingo suggested, and only enable this for apps like JACK and
cdrecord that have been farily well audited and can be trusted to use
this feature (for example JACK has the internal watchdog to keep a bad
client from locking the system).  Really it only makes sense for a
distro to enable this if the user selects the "low latency desktop" or
"multimedia desktop" or whatever install option and makes clear that
this profile is NOT suitable for a multiuser system.
