Ok.  I don't use bk, but I can update relative to the latest snapshot on
kernel.org.

Agreed.  I hadn't thought about that angle.  I am open to suggestions on
other ways to make it work.

There is no fault that would be taken.  The address is valid, but above
TASK_SIZE.  The purpose of access_ok is to say that it's ok to try it and
let it fault, because it's a user-visible address and not the kernel memory
mapped into the high part of every process's address space.  The accesses
that follow are done in kernel mode, so there is no fault for pages marked
as not user-visible.  The fixmap addresses are > TASK_SIZE and so fail the
__range_ok test, heretofore making access_ok return false.  Those are the
code paths leading to EFAULT that I mentioned.
So far I can't think of a better way to do it.
> You'll be wanting to parenthesise `size' and `type' here.
I didn't bother because the existing macros do not consistently
parenthesize their arguments and so if there were really any problems they
would already show.  But I agree it's what should be done.

You got me.  That version of gcc has many, many bugs and is long obsolete.
Random meaningless perturbations of the code might change its behavior.
