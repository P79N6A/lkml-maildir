Exact Chipset ?
This makes many troubles:
00:00.0 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C691 [Apollo PRO] (rev c4)
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 8
Build in in Epox epd3va.

Would be fine. ;->>
The IRQ routing was struggling over a lousy pci-host-bridge and an idiotic
(and ugly badly documented) irq routing on the epox board.
This one runns only with "noapic pirq=5,10,11,15" and fires up to much 
irqs onto the same one, leaving other possible resoures unused. Just have 
a look on irq 10, there are three sources of irq working. This fails 
sometimes. No wonder why. ;-<<
Also was it impossible to get suitable usb-bus-bandwith-performance for 
the scanner (HP 6350) to get it scanning withouts stopping and 
re-starting (buffer transmission to sane/xsane).
