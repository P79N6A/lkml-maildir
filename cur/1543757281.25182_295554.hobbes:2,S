I wondered about this a couple of minutes ago, too. I have a SiS760 and
can't enable AGP support either.
What host bridge does your system have? If it's anything but a 760, the
agpgart code for sis needs to be patched by adding the proper PCI ID.
(All this apart from the !X86_64 in the Kconfig file.)
I am running 32bit only at the moment (waiting for a new harddisk to
install, the 32bit system is only for some initial testing), but does
AGP compile and initialize correctly if you remove the !X86_64 in
drivers/char/agp/Kconfig at the AGP_SIS entry?
