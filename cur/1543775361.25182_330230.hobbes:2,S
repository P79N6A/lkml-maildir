We need this because the NVidia driver uses change_page_attr() to make
pages non-cachable, which is causing systems to spontaneously reboot
when it gets a page that's in the first 8MB of memory.
I'll look at x86_64.  The problem was seen originally with i386, and I
haven't taken much time to look at the x86_64 stuff yet.
Thanks,
Stuart
