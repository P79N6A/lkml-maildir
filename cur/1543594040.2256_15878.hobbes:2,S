Further exhaustive testing along the lines you describe above has led me
to believe this is an intermittent hardware problem on the notebook's
motherboard.  I'm able to trigger the hard lockup both in Linux and in
Windows 2000.  It appears to be triggered by stress on a certain part of
the notebook's case.
I'm having the motherboard replaced.  If it turns out not to be the
problem, I'll follow up here.
Thanks for the help,
