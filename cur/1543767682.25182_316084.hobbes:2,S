Logically buggy.  You can't have an attachment without the MIME markup that
*says* it's an attachment.  I think what you meant was "No Content-Type-Encoding":
i.e. 'none' is acceptable, but 'quoted-printable' (which causes all the
spurious =20 and =3D you sometimes see) and 'base64' (uuencode on steroids)
aren't....
