Yes. consensus of the messages I received is that it's the cpu flagging an
internal hardware problem. 
Suggested causes include:
	overclocking
	thermal problems
	CPU actually bad
Definitely not caused by:
	Bad Rams, mb-chipset.
In my case the error only occured once and never again - marked it up to bad
karma on that day.
Bye, Martin
