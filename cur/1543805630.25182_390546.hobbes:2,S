Thanks a lot - it did the trick - the speed is back!
But anyway, do you have a clue why do I still get this error?
PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #6:20000@f8000000 for 0000:40:00.0
I've several workstations with _exactly_ the same hardware. I've tried
two of them - both give the error with 2.6.15.1 (and no errors with
2.6.11.12).
