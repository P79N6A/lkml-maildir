Changing the scheduler did not help (the results are about the same with 
any of the 4 schedulers). Read ahead is already set to 256 (increasing 
to 1024 did not help either). Kernel compilation takes too much time 
here so I didn't test with preempt disabled.
The drive is WD300BB (7200RPM) in UDMA2 mode.
