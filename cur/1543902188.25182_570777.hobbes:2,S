I've been wondering why PARPORT_PC_FIFO is EXPERIMENTAL. If it's expected to 
work these days it could be made non-experimental, and perhaps enabled 
always even.
Also not sure of the value of PARPORT_PC_SUPERIO. I haven't checked in some 
time, but that code didn't use to work for me even though I have a chipset 
which seems supported (Winbond 83977). These days, PNP (-ACPI) is providing 
PARPORT with the needed info for me:
| pnp: the driver 'parport_pc' has been registered
| pnp: match found with the PnP device '00:09' and the driver 'parport_pc'
| parport_pc 00:09: reported by Plug and Play ACPI
| parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778), irq 7, dma 3 
[PCSPP,TRISTATE,COMPAT,EPP,ECP,DMA]
| lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven).
If that's also expected, perhaps that option and code could just go...
