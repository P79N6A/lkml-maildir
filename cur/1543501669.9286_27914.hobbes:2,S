Add  alsactl  to that list.  I get "Unable to handle kernel paging request
at 5a5a5aXX"
every time I run alsactl.  I'm using ALSA CVS snapshots, but i've rolled back
to a previous version that worked (apparently) flawlessly w/ 2.2.10-ac6. 
The sound drivers do appear to work, but they can't be unloaded. I can set
mixer levels w/ an OSS mixer and play sounds thru it.
