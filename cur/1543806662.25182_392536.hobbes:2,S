Nothing is preventing it from seizing other PS/2 ports, as far as I
know. I believe it's working for me right now because the keyboard
grabs the keyboard PS/2 port first, and then the liyitec driver grabs
the rest of the ports, which, in my case, is only the psaux port which
is connected to the liyitec screen.

I'm not sure. I'll find out what the touchscreen's response to the
PS/2 GETID command is.

In a private mail to me, Vojtech Pavlik pointed out that lifebook.c is
a PS/2 touch screen that does exactly this, and in only 136 lines of
code. I'll see if I can adapt my existing serio driver to be a psmouse
driver.
Thanks for your comments, Dmitry. Cheers,
Shaun
