Please, do not add crap to struct device_node. It's already bloated
enough and we intend to instead get rid of the stuff in there.
Do you actually need to save the config space at all ? Can't you just
use "assigned-address" property to fill up the BARs again ? As for the
other EEH things, well, we probably need to bite the bullet and do what
we talked about doing for a while, that is split the PCI related junk
out of struct device_node and into a separate structure. We could maybe
at first (to ease the transition) keep a pointer to it in device_node,
and we can create that structure early in pci_dn. That way, we only
really need to add gunk to PCI devices and not to all nodes. Same for
VIO actually.
Ben.
