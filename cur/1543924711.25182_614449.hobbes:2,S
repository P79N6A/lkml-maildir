Ingo, Steven, Thomas,
Please consider this series for inclusion in 23-rt6, as it has shown
to make a substantial improvement in our local testing.  Independent
verification and/or comments/review are more than welcome.

RT: scheduler migration/wakeup enhancements
This series applies to 23.1-rt5 and includes numerous tweaks to the
scheduler.  The primary goal of this set of patches is to further improve
wake-up latencies (particularly on larger SMP systems) and decrease migration
overhead.  This is accomplished by making improvements on several fronts:
1) We factor in CPU topology in the routing decision to pick the best
   migration target according to cache hierarchy.
2) We moved some CFS load calculation code as a member function of the CFS
   sched_class.  This removes this unecessary code from the RT fastpath for
   tasks in the RT sched_class.
3) We make further improvements against non-migratable tasks by factoring in
   the RQ overload state, instead of just the RQ depth.
4) We replace the linear priority search with a 2-d algorithm.
In past -rt releases, latencies could become quickly absymal on larger SMP (8+
cpus) to the order of 350us+.  The recent work in -rt2 and -rt4 dropped this
figure by a large margin, bringing things in the order of approximately
~120us.  This new series improves upon this work even further, bringing
latencies down to the sub 80us mark on our reference 8-way Intel C2D 5335
Xeon.
These figures were obtained by simultaneous execution of:
# ./cyclictest -n -p 90 -t 8 -d 100 -i 100
# while true; do make mrproper; make alldefconfig; make -j 128; done
for long durations.  The following are the results from one particular run,
though the results are similar across various short and long term trials in
our labs.
