Another possibility (perhaps a really stupid idea ;) would be to
snapshot the list of pids on the open, and let the readdir() just
access that fixed array.
The kernel/cpuset.c cpuset_tasks_open() routine that displays the
pids of tasks in a cpuset (the per-cpuset 'tasks' file) does this.
Then the seek and read and such semantics are nice and stable and
simple.
Throw out the snapshot on the last close.
