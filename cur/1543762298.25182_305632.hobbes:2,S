Subject: Possible bug: ASYNC IO with RT Signals in threaded application doesnt work
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have a multithread application which uses ASYNC IO but is RT signal
driven. I have a worker thread which handles all connection and accepts
all data that are received. I use SIGRTMIN as the signal to be delivered
whenever my socket is ready with data. All my threads block SIGRTMIN
including the main thread. In the worker thread I have something like
this
while (1) {
  sigwaitinfo ();
  ...
  ...
  ...
}
I am never able dequeue SIGRTMIN from the pending signal queue from the
worker thread. If I do the above in the main thread then I am able
dequeue SIGRTMIN from the pending signal queue.
Is this a bug in the kernel or is it a feature. I am also attaching a
patch along with this email which solves the ASYNC IO problem with RT
signals.
Thanks,
Bharath
