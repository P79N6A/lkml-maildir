Subject: RLIM_INFINITY support for RLIMIT_NOFILE (patch)

Good day all, I recently found that the linux kernel does not support setting
a process' RLIMIT_NOFILE limits to the #define RLIM_INFINITY.  My patch will
add such support by setting the limit to the maximum supported by the kernel
when a call to set a limit to RLIM_INFINITY is made.
I understand that the semantics do not match exactly but all kernels are limited
by real hard limits and/or available memory, I think that it is therefore 
acceptable to have a call to set a limit to RLIM_INFINITY actually set the 
limit to the maximum extent supported by the kernel.
