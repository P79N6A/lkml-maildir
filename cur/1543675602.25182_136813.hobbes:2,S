   Considering that the Alpha and the UltraSparc can issue up to 4
   instruction per cycle,
Ultrasparc only has 2 integer units.  So it really can only do 2
integer operations per cycle.  GCC is giving it an optimal schedule
for -mtune=ultrasparc, I know because I wrote that instruction
scheduler :-)
You can get 4 issue if you're doing floating point stuff.
I believe the current generation Alpha has 3 integer units.
GCC should be doing a good job there too.
