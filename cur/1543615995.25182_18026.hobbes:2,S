Well, I do think that doing a cleanup sooner is better than later as it
always gets bigger and bigger pain (both the change and keeping up the old
situation), so I would suggest to agree on a clear and consistent dirtree
now, and make that change whatever it is.
Though this is really not a big issue, it's still a great moment for this
kind of change imho.
