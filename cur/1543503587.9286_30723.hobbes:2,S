Yes, they do have all the same problem. If your boot partition doesn't
start under the 1024 cylinder limit the BIOS won't be able to find
the bootblock and then there's no way the system can start. It's not
an OS limitation, it's a BIOS limitation.
Try it if you're that anxious, get an empty drive, partition it so that
the first 1024 cylinders are empty and put your boot partition after
that, install whatever you like, and then try to get it to boot. :)
Broken BIOS's for broken hardware, you know.
Grtz,
Pascal
