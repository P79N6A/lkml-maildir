Like many other parameters, ecn can improve performance but may result 
in a non-functional network. Based on that I still think it's better for 
the default to be "works" and use of ecn or other tuning parameters such 
as reducing timeouts should be "tuning" instead.
Adding a few printk's seems to show that ecn is not so common that it 
needs to be on by default. I suspect that the main use of ecn code is in 
fighting with those broken routers and firewalls rather than improving 
performance.
