Hi everybody,
I just experienced a compile problem of 2.3.13. I do not think that is 
kernel-related, but I do not know where to ask else:
gcc (btw: 2.95) tries to compile linux/arch/i386/boot/tools/build.c 
with -fno-strict-aliases set. It breaks with the error message that 
__bzero
is a not known to it. glibc is 2.1.0. Any hints for me to solve this?
Thanks!
