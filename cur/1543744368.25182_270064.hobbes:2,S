This is Linux, not MS-DOS, where the system works for the user and you 
shouldn't have to do nonsense like "do you really want to load the 
module?" I agree with Dick, you shouldn't have to recompile the whole 
kernel to fix a trivial change. If you shoot yourself in the foot it's 
your fault, taking away the the gun is the policy of another o/s I won't 
name.
