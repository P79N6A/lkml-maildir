It is in all the kernels I've looked at, but that's mainly because we
seem to ignore MS_INVALIDATE.

SUSv3 says
        When MS_INVALIDATE is specified, msync() shall invalidate all
        cached copies of mapped data that are inconsistent with the
        permanent storage locations such that subsequent references
        shall obtain data that was consistent with the permanent storage
        locations sometime between the call to msync() and the first
        subsequent memory reference to the data.
which seems to imply that dirty ptes should simply be cleared, rather
than propagated to the page dirty bits.
That's easy enough --- we already propagate the flags down to
filemap_sync_pte, where the page and pte dirty bits are modified.  Does
anyone know any reason why we don't do MS_INVALIDATE there already?
