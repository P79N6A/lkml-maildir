I couldn't figure out the reason, it seems to have something to do
with setting up device pointers for iptables and ebtables. It looks
like the only way to fix this problem without keeping the conntrack
reference while packets are queued at the device is to avoid defering
the NF_IP_* hooks. Bart, can you explain why the hooks are defered
please?
