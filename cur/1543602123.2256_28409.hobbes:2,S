Subject: apm broken in 2.4.10? (on IBM Thinkpad T21)

Hi,
I just upgraded to 2.4.10 from 2.4.7. I didnt change any of the APM
configurations from my 2.4.7 configuration. Yet, everytime I tried to
suspend the machine, I got messages saying that APM was not built into the
kernel.
Finally, I replaced arch/i386/kernel/apm.c with the corresponding apm.c
from 2.4.7 and got my apm functions to work again.
What has changed since 2.4.7?
