most of the PCI alpha's support scatter gather in the chipset. ie you can
dynamically setup multiple bus->phys windows in the chipset.
so you could map any part of pci bus address to anywhere in physical space.
With multiple windows you could even map a contigious pci bus space to a
fragmented range of physical addresses.
Tru64 uses this for scatter gather support, even to 4GB+ phys addresses.
However linux doesn't use this feature at all. On linux we just setup two
2GB static mappings.

support for the 21172/21174 style hardware scatter gather would be nice and
generic.. :)
