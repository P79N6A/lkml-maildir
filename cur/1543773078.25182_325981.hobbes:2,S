The user has knowingly choosen to be persistent and it will be responsible
for handling multiple requests. I understand the concern here is that if by 
accident the user writes 2 to loading...I am working on the next patch
which will address this issue.

This is a valid concern and it is also true with the current code. 
Calling request_firmware_nowait for the current code the driver is 
at mercy of the user to send a cancel request to loading. Any driver
unload will fail till the user cancles it.
I realized that while playing with dell_rbu ( which uses request_firmware_nowait)

I respecfully disagree ; I think the request_firmware_nowait is not complete
if we dont have a way to make it persistent. Also if the other drivers are 
required to do the re-arming they will still end up in the same situation 
of not being able to unload unless the user chooses to cancel firmware.
The best fix is to fix this in frimware_class.c. 
I had experienced this exact thing with dell_rbu driver.I will address these 
issues in my next patch. 
Thanks
