You can use as much memory as you can afford if the designer of
this system would only understand that you can't fit 4 GB of
application RAM into 4 GB of address-space and leave anything
available for the system.
It needs to be done like this:
------------|-------------|-----------
 Other      |   N Mbyte   |  Other address space
 address    |   window    |  ..................
------------|-------------|-----------
            |
            |
        -----------------
        | Page register |
        |----------------
                        |
                        -----------------------
                        |    Page 0            |
                        |--|--------------------
                           |  Page 1            |
                           |---------------------
                                Page N, etc.
You make a small window in the available address-space, and you
map your RAM into that address-space with a page register. You
can access much, much more RAM than available address-space,
and with things like video and pictures, the occasional switching
of a page-register adds practically no overhead.
