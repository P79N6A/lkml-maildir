I'll keep investigating this as I think its a real object
leak. Looking at why params[1] has a different reference_count from
params[0], led me to the following backtrace on the ref count
increment (that's getting really complicated):
  acpi_ut_add_reference
  acpi_ds_method_data_get_value
  acpi_ex_resolve_object_to_value
  acpi_ex_resolve_to_value
  acpi_ex_resolve_operands
    (I have a suspicion that the above function should call
     acpi_ut_remove_reference(obj_desc) on an error return path but it
     actually doesn't and, therefore, the ref count remains
     incremented. In this function, params[0] ref count is 3 but the
     one for params[1] becomes 4)
  acpi_ds_exec_end_op (called via walk_state->ascending_callback)
  acpi_ps_parse_loop
  acpi_ps_parse_aml
  acpi_ps_execute_pass
  acpi_ps_execute_method
  acpi_ns_execute_control_method
  acpi_ns_evaluate_by_handle
  acpi_ev_execute_reg_method
Any suggestions/hints? I hope to get to the bottom of this in the next
few days.
Thanks.
