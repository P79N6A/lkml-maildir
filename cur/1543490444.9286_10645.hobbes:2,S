I have a AVA1505 card and a Traxdata somethingorother CD-R.
Recently whenever I've tried to burn a CD it seems to solidly
hang Linux while using cdrecord, and even cdparanoia seems to have
managed to trip it.
This occurs in 2.0.34, 2.2.3, 2.2.3ac2, with both cdrecord 1.6 (as
packaged with Debian potato, and the one packaged with Debian hamm)
and cdrecord 1.8a19 (I think that's the latest version) which I tested
it with this morning.
Symptoms are a hard lockup, no response
from the system at all, sysrq fails to achieve anything.
I've made no changes to the kernel (of 2.2.3ac2) with the single
exception of adding the line -DSKIP_BIOSTEST that seems to be needed
to talk to my scsi card. It usually seems to read (and write) from the
ZIP drive that's attached fine, and usually seems to read from the 
cdrom fine.
I have my config available if it's required (I don't want to clutter up
the list if it isn't) - suffice to say I am building scsi as modules
(my primary drives are IDE) and most other things are modules too and
recently I have setup fb as well, although it dies without this.
I would also like to recommend that the aha152x driver should be modified
to automatically do the skip_biostest check, or for it to be placed in
the .config file, as this is bound to confuse some users
Thanks very much.
