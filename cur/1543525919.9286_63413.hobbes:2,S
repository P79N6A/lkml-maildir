thats a workaround i added ages ago - we switch off the FASTCALL macro
(regparm calling-convention extension of GCC which passes up to 3
parameters through %eax, %edx, %ecx) - in the IKD case the parameters go
through the stack, in the non-IKD case edx (second parameter) is zeroed,
eax is passed in as-is.
IKD triggered problems (likely bugs in previous GCC versions) if regparm
was used together with -pg (GCC's function-prologue profiling extension
calling _mcount). mcount() is the basis of the majority of IKD
'anti-lockup' and tracing features.
