Not being able to take advantage of the latest whizz bang features
sound sane.  Kernel ABI changes do not sound sane.

Huh? I can understand it from the rational of a support contract, 
limiting the number of possibilities you have to deal with.  Beyond
that it just seems ludicrous.  If something is relied up by user
space it should be stable enough that you can upgrade your kernel.
It should be a case of not-supported but it ``should'' work.  So
anyone who is competent enough to do kernel development should 
have no problem getting things going.

Which is a really bad tack to take.  It seriously forks the kernel
debugging and testing efforts.  Even with a distro that only wants
to support one kernel if people are having kernel hardware interaction
problems I will still suggest that they upgrade their kernel to
see if the problems are fixed in the newer kernels.  If there are
user space glitches but the drivers work, there are a lot more people
who can fix user space than can fix the kernel.
The historic rule is that if you need to know what needs to be changed
you read through Documentation/Changes.  If your distro has something
older you probably need to upgrade if not you don't.

But this applies to kernel debugging so having a distro that is tied
intimately to their kernel is a problem for anyone running on recent
hardware.
