The only difference is in order of searching for devices. Stradis now gets
control before your "real" driver. Kick stradis from your config or blacklist
it. Or, why you ever load module, you don't want to use?
There is no change in searching devices, it didn't check for subvendors before
not even now. If Nathan knows, there are some subvendor/subdevices ids, which we
should compare to, then yes, we can change the behaviour, otherwise, I am
afraid, we can't. It's vendors' problem, that they don't use this pci registers
(and it's evil) -- i think, that stradis cards have that two zeroed.
