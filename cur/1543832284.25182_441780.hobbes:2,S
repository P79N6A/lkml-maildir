Thanks for all responses. The file was modified from 
drivers/macintosh/therm_adt746x.c, the function call i2c_add_driver() in 
static int __init thermostat_init(void) caused a null point. In fact, 
all i2c related functions were not linked. The i2c-core.c has been built 
in kernel. How does the module therm_adt746x.ko link to i2c? I did not 
see that the module therm_adt746x.ko resolved symbol i2c_add_driver. Or, 
the symbols are resolved during insmod? I guess I try to figure out 
whether this problem is caused by building process in kernel or by 
module loading process in insmod (using BusyBox)?
Thank you.
