One option is to use a mechanism where the kernel selects the aio
syscall number from any of the available numbers, and publishes it
in some easily accessible location. User-space then needs to grab it
from that location at app/lib init time before doing any actual work.
(This of course goes away when/if you do get an official syscall number.)
This is at least how I intend to do the "ioctl on device" to "real
syscall" transition for my x86 performance counters driver.
