You are making a value call as you see it.  Others have
disagreed.

Just how slowly or quickly to CPUs fail?  Does an admin have time
to look up the list of processes that are bound to which CPUs,
move them or kill them, etc., before giving the offline-that-CPU
command?  or would she/he rather tell the system how to handle
CPU-offlining conflicts and then just issue the one command?

Yep, I noticed that too, but didn't comment on it.
