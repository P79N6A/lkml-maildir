Curious as to when would this occur. Probably for tasks running on a  
SMP machine for a very short period of time (timer drift should not  
be hopefully that high) and switching CPUs in that short period of time?

Probably TASK_DELAY_STATS_CONNECTOR and TASK_DELAY_ACCOUNTING are  
better names?

Does this mean, whether or not the per task delay accounting is used,  
we have a constant overhead of sizeof(spinlock_t) + 2*sizeof 
(uint32_t) + 2* sizeof(uint64_t) bytes going into the struct  
task_struct?. Is it possible/beneficial to use struct task_delay_info  
*delays instead and allocate it if task wants to use the information?
