No, I don't.  The bug_table symbols are rather unconditionally defined
in asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h.  This can't be affected by any config
settings that I can see, let alone module support.  Further, the
config I always build has modules enabled, and I've never seen this.
Can you try starting over with an mrproper and see if you can
reproduce it?
