I actually don't know of any others -- not that I'm an expert on the
range of devices that exist...
What's your feeling about drivers like amso1100, which don't
particularly care about atomicity, but just want to write a 64-bit
quantity conveniently?  Should we require writeq()/__raw_writeq() for
all archs, and then define CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_64BIT_ATOMIC_MMIO_WRITES as
appropriate?
I see stuff like this is drivers/dma/ioatdma.c:
#if (BITS_PER_LONG == 64)
	ioatdma_chan_write64(ioat_chan, IOAT_CHAINADDR_OFFSET, desc->phys);
#else
	ioatdma_chan_write32(ioat_chan,
	                     IOAT_CHAINADDR_OFFSET_LOW,
	                     (u32) desc->phys);
	ioatdma_chan_write32(ioat_chan, IOAT_CHAINADDR_OFFSET_HIGH, 0);
#endif
and drivers/char/hpet.c:
#ifndef readq
static inline unsigned long long readq(void __iomem *addr)
{
	return readl(addr) | (((unsigned long long)readl(addr + 4)) << 32LL);
}
#endif
#ifndef writeq
static inline void writeq(unsigned long long v, void __iomem *addr)
{
	writel(v & 0xffffffff, addr);
	writel(v >> 32, addr + 4);
}
#endif
and so on...
