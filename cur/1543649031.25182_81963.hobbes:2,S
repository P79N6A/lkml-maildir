No, you don't.
2+ people having copyrights on something only occurs when you have 
joint authorship (or rare partial transfers).
In this case, what we have is the a transfer of copyright from you, to 
the FSF ("my entire right, title, and interest (including all rights 
under copyright))"
It's like transferring rights to real property (in most countries, you 
can view copyright as an object of property in trying to determine what 
you can do with it)
When rights are transferred to another party, the original author 
doesn't get any residual rights unless these are expressly reserved as 
a "grant back".
You are no longer the owner of the copy right.
