What I believe is happening is that we're talking to SMM emulation of
the i8042, which doesn't have a clue about these commands, while the
underlying real hardware implementation does. And because of that they
disagree on what should happen when the command is issued, and since the
SMM emulation lazily synchronizes with the real HW, we only get the data
back with the next command.
I still don't have an explanation why both 'usb-handoff' and 'acpi=off'
help, I'd expect only the first to, but it might be related to the SCI
interrupt routing which isn't done when 'acpi=off'. Just a wild guess.
