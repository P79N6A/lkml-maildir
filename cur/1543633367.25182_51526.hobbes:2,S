i agree that this is a subtle issue. My first version of the migration
code did something like this - it's a natural desire to manually migrate
the target task (there are various levels of doing this - the very first
version of the code directly unlinked the thread from the current runqueue
and linked it into the target runqueue), instead of having to switch to a
migration-thread.
the fundamental reason for this fragility is the following: the room to
move the concept of migration into the O(1) design is very very small, if
the condition is to not increase the cost of the scheduler fastpath.
the only robust way i found was to use a highprio helper thread which
naturally unschedules the current task. Attempts to somehow unschedule a
to-be-migrated task without having to switch into the helper thread turned
out to be problematic.
