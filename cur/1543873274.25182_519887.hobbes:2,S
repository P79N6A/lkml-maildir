Greg, you once indicated you had class device conversion patches for
1394 in the pipeline, but they couldn't go out to -mm or wherever
because of them depending on unfinished driver core changes.  If you
found that the 1394 subsystem needed some special treatment, there might
be a chance to eliminate this by pulling some historically grown but now
obsolete infrastructure out.  (Of course not for 2.6.21-rc anymore, but
perhaps post 2.6.21 if we take it on quickly.)
