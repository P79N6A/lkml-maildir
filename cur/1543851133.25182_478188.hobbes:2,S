This patch is still wordwrapped, is against a file which doesn't exist any more
(it moved into drivers/ata) and is wrong (ahci.c now uses helper macros in
these tables).
So please
- read 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
 really
  carefully.  All of it.
- Download the most recent kernel from
  
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/
 and regenerate and
  retest the patches.
- Send some test patches to yourself or to a colleague, make sure that
  they reach the other end in an applyable state.
then resend all of your patches: IDE, ahci, sata and hda_intel.
Thanks.
