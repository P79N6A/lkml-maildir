You are waking up multiple tasks which will each submit
1 request. You want to be waking up 1 task which will
submit multiple requests - that is how you will save
context switches, cpu cache, etc, and that task's requests
will have a much better chance of being merged, or at
least serviced as a nice batch than unrelated tasks.
