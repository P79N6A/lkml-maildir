I suspect that you'll find different workload patterns and sequences which
cause similar regressions in the future.  It'd be useful to sit down and
try to think of some and try them out.
I think the bottom line here is that the kernel just cannot predict the
future and it will need help from the applications and/or administrators to
be able to do optimal things.  For that, finer-grained one-knob-per-concept
controls would be better.
