hai all,
    I am a newbie to kernel, I want to work on linux kernel modules.
My task is to call a user program from keyboard driver under certain 
conditions. I know that we can call user program using 
call_usermodehelper(), but we can not call it direcly from driver as it is 
a interrupt context. So we need to call using schedule_work(). But I need 
more clarification on these points. How to call user program from the 
keyboard driver. Please give ur ideas for doing this.
Any small help is appreciated.
Please cc ur replies to my mail id.
   Thanks&Regards,
   P.Manohar,
