Well... Microsoft "[does] not guarantee and [does] not support the
accuracy of the W32Time service between nodes on a network. The
W32Time service is not a full-featured NTP solution that meets
time-sensitive application needs."  (See
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/939322
).  The w32time daemon is not
guaranteed to be within a few seconds of UTC at *any* time of the
year, let alone immediately after a leap-second.  In addition, windows
does not have any built-in interpolation between timer ticks, so time
increases in ~15ms steps regardless of how accurate your clock is.
