Well, I can't check right know but seemed to be the same. I will keep the next 5 oops with same distro and make a diff to be sure.

OK
>3: Can the problem be reproduced on other machines?
Unfortunately, I can't use any other computer for this (or I will lose some friends :-) If there was already some reports about this bug, it can be good to compare the hardware and/or environment with these others people.
>4: try a different compiler version.
I already tried gcc 3.2.3 and 3.3.1 (2.95.3 to be confirmed)
I will make the tests (1, 2 and confirmed 4) and give you the results tomorrow.
Just an idea: could it be an ACPI problem ?
I will try some boot parameters too, to be sure...
