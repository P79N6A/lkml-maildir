Huh? Every time someone has asked about this, I've said "good idea,
code it up and send a patch to Linus/Marcelo". I don't want to deal
with pushing this into the kernel, I'm having enough trouble getting
Linus to apply the current batch of devfs fixes.
As long as I'm in the loop somewhere, just to do a sanity check, I'm
satisfied. I don't have an overwhelming urge to maintain various devfs
patches for drivers. Been there, done that :-(
I'm even willing to sprinkle my own unholy penguin pee on a patch if
someone thinks (wrongly:-) that it will help get it applied. You can't
ask for more than that, right? (OK, you can, but you won't get it:-).
