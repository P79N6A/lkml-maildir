It was originally added to mark symbols that are clearly internal only
and make a work derivative. It's somewhere expanded to include symbols
whose code authors think that a cease and desist is the correct answer
to non GPL use.
I can't really help personally on the details there since I'm of the
opinion that _GPLONLY while useful doesn't generally make a blind bit of
difference as most if not all binary modules are violating the license.
(And I'm sure Nvidia's legal counsel disagrees with me at least in
public)
