In include/asm-ppc64/cache.h I ended up redefining ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp
to avoid the problem of things sharing a cacheline: 
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
#define ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp __cacheline_aligned
#else
#define ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp
#endif /* CONFIG_SMP */
so that these things end up in the cacheline_aligned section and no variables
share a cacheline. Maybe there are some places where we want to group
variables in the same cacheline, but for consistency I think we should
have:
__cacheline_aligned{,_in_smp}
	variable goes into cacheline_aligned section
____cacheline_aligned{,_in_smp}
	just align to a cacheline
