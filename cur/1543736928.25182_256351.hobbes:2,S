Well, #1 is the intention and spirit of the kevent system.
And adding a new signal type is fine.
So the only downside is that the table to interface association thing.
I have no idea how big an issue that is for you.
You could of course create a new kobject, ala #2, but that does not seem
optimal if the object is otherwise worthless.  I don't think that you
should create a new class.  Better to put something under /sys/net
related to what you are doing.
