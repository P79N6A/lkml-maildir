Are you talking about "make -jN"?
If so, that is purely for deciding how many threads to use to *compile*
the code, not run-time execution. Not relevant.
As Arjan said, you should use the normal kbuild infrastructure,
either for external module builds by using something like:
make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`pwd`
make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`pwd` modules_install
or for in-kernel-tree builds.
See linux/Documentation/kbuild/
Simply provide a driver Makefile that contains all tags required for kbuild
infrastructure, that should automatically take care of any and all
compiler flags you need to use, whether you're using an
SMP kernel configuration or not.
For sample users of the external kbuild driver build, see e.g. the
acx WLAN driver (both in-kernel and external build possible there,
see README).
About SMP in general: AFAIK there is nothing to configure here,
the only thing you really have to get right is proper locking inside your
driver to prevent concurrent resource access.

P.S.: oh, and getting this driver submitted for kernel inclusion
      would be nice :)
      (both for you and us, since it'd reduce amount of maintenance work
       due to people improving it automatically)
