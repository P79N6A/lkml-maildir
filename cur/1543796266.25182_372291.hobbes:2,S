Dear list,
I had some questions regarding using /proc/stat (on the 2.6 kernel).
Can I assume that reading /proc/stat is 'atomic'? Can I assume that  
when I read
the file, that nothing will change the data while I am reading it?
IE:
   cpu  15948315 4687107 3321012 122412279 659908 43304 144288
   cpu0 15948315 4687107 3321012 122412279 659908 43304 144288
can I assume that while I am reading the third value (system), that  
the fourth value (idle)
will not be changed underneath me? Can I assume that all the lines?  
cpu, cpu0 will all be
generated at once?
My second question is regarding using these values to calculate usage...
Should I calculate usage by
(where T1, T2 are time)
A) read /proc/stat
    Fill variables UserT1, NiceT1, SystemT1, IdleT1, IOWaitT1, irqT1,  
irq2T1
    wait a time
    Fill variables UserT2, NiceT2, SystemT2, IdleT2, IOWaitT2, irqT2,  
irq2T2
    DeltaTotalTime=(UserT2-UserT1)+(NiceT2-NiceT1)+(SystemT2-SystemT1) 
+(.........)
    Then calculate the values I want as the delta  
variableOfInterest / total delta
    ie: (UserT2-UserT1)/DeltaTotalTime
    Can I assume that all these values added together should add up  
to 100%?
or
B) read /proc/stat
    read variable of interest, ie: UserT1 and btimeT1 and number of CPUs
    wait a time
    read variable of interest, ie: UserT2 and btimeT2 and number of CPUs
    Then calculate the values I want as
      ((UserT2-UserT1)/NumCPU)/(btimeT2-btimeT1)*100 (Jiffies)
Thanks for any comments
Regards
Andrew
