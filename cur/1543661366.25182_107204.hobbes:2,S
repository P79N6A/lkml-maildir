Thanks for the quick response, Richard!

The patch cable I've got has worked on other machines and hub set up
for 10Base-T.

Both the hub and the PC show link lights when connected, yes. The hub
is 10Base-T also.

I will certainly give this a try. It's turning out to be quite an
experience in how the Linux kernel thinks of devices. :) I don't really
care which eth port it uses, as long as it works. 
So my ifconfig would be:
ifconfig eth1 address 192.168.0.4  netmask 255.255.255.0 
- right?
I'm curious though - does ipconfig actually *create* the device ethx?
Isn't that what the SIS900 module is doing -- detecting a device and
mapping it onto eth0? dmesg does not reveal a similar report for eth1.
In that case, how do I force it to use the transceiver at address 3 (see
the dmesg above), or will it decide to use that one automatically? Sorry
for my ignorance.
Thanks very much,
Cameron Goble
