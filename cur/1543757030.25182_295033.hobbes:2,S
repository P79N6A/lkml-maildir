I think the better solution for this would be to finally integrate Steve L.'s 
file attribute code (and find some solution to make it persistent,
e.g. using xattrs with a new inode flag) and then "lock" the shared 
libraries to their policy using a new attribute flag.

I don't get this. Surely the migration code will check if a page
is already in the target node, and when that is the case do nothing.
How could this "double migration" happen?

That sounds like a quite obscure corner case which I'm not sure
is worth all the complexity.
