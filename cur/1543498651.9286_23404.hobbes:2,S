I'm not sure that's the case.  Having this problem on stock RH 6, i586 UP
(also tried SMP for the sake of trying).  egcs-19990314,
binutils-2.9.1.0.23.  Also tried the same on my laptop with equal amounts
of non-success.  Same configuration works fine under 2.3.5.
Anybody with more knowledge than me have any ideas?  If not, I'll try and
dig up a gcc 2.7.2 and see if I run into the same problem
