My logs show this went into 2.4 with this comment:
  usb-storage: ISD-200 fixes, more unusual devices, and many cleanups
  (o) Fix to ISD-200 driver to work on big-endian platforms, including PPC.
      This has been in circulation for a while, and seems well-tested.
  (o) Add several unusual_devs.h entries
  (o) A couple more debugging improvements
  (o) A slight improvement to the EXPERIMENTAL HP82xx driver, which should
      help with newer units.
  (o) A _major_ cleanup of error handling code throughout the driver.  Note
      that this is in preparation to deploy the new error-handling state
      machine (special thanks to Alan Sterm for this work).  Right now, the
      optimizations are simple and straightforward (elimination of redundant
      code paths, etc).  Nothing tremendous, but it looks kinda invasive.
So this was a tiny part of a bigger patch.  I defer to Matt as to if
this kind of change should be put into 2.5.
thanks,
