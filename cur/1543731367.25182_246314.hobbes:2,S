I would think that it would return 4MB. If it can't find standard ROM
headers it should return the window size. 
Are you sure you are getting the correct contents of those ROMs? Would
it be worthwhile to try and get the author of the ROMs to add standard
ROM headers? The content you included doesn't look that useful unless
that is what IA64 instructions look like.
If reading past 1MB for those ROMs causes a reboots, could something be
wrong in the IA64 fault handing code?
I'd feel a lot better if someone actually tried this patch on a ppc or
sun machine.
