Hi.  I just (lastnight) installed 2.2.14, and patched it to 2.2.15pre6.
Now, any time I try to telnet to localhost, I get a gfp message on the
console.  However, this only happens if I'm running this certain userspace
program, tcplogd.  If its not running, I don't get any gfps.  If it is, I
get one 100% of the time if I telnet into localhost.
fint:~# telnet localhost 21
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
gfp called by non-running (1) task from c2bdf9e0!

I can reproduce this (but with diferent values) every single time if
tcplogd is running.  2.2.15pre6, single Intel 233 Pentium.
Signed,
