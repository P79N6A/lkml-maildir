Hi,
in sys/shm.h and in  bits/shm.h there's defined a flag  SHM_REMAP
but I don't see it being used anywhere in the kernel. This was used in 2.2.x
kernels
in the file ipc/shm.c but I have looked for it in the latest 2.4.14 and it seems
it not used
anymore and it's not used in the Itanium RedHat linux-2.4.7-2 we have installed
either.
Has this support for SHM_REMAP been droped or am I missing someting?
Thanks in advance,
Rafa
