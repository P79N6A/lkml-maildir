This is true in the classic PDP-10 architecture, but would it
really be worthwhile to run Linux in an 18-bit address space?.
In the extended architecture, an int * is a 30-bit address, and the
byte offset and size is encoded in the top 6 bits.  This would be a
more suitable target for Linux.

When a pointer-to-integer conversion is made (or vice versa), GCC
could generate code to convert between a PDP-10 hardware pointer and a
linear byte address.

Right.

The KI10 has limited support for paging, but I don't remember the
details.  KL10 most definitely supports full paged virtual memory.
