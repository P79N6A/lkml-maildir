That makes sense.
It would work good enough in many cases, though it would be hard to
make sure that it really exists in core before sendfile().

Yes.
And it seems to be more important on UDP sendfile().
processes or threads sharing the same UDP socket would affect each other,
while processes or threads on TCP sockets don't care about it as TCP
connection is peer to peer.
Thank you,
