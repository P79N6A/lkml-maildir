That sort of thing is going to make distros incredibly reluctant to 
update kernels, which just encourages them to operate inside their own
fiefdoms, rather than working together with mainline, which is what we
want.
Moreover, its' not just the big distros. It's every corporation with a
product based around Linux, which are far more numerous and smaller
operations. We *have* to encourage these people to work with us, else
we end up not getting bug fixes back upstream from them etc.
That means giving them stable, consistent userspace<->kernel APIs.
