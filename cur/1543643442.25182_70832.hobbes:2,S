Timing works both ways.  Maybe you run into a bug on native i386 that UML
won't reproduce.  Maybe UML will reproduce bugs you won't see on hardware.
That doesn't help you track down a particular bug you're seeing on hardware,
but as far as overall bug smashing goes, it looks like a wash to me.

That's potentially fixable.  UML has SCSI support now, with a USB driver
in the works.  Other hardware access is possible, too.

Then we need to push code out from arch into the generic kernel.  That's
happening slowly, but there's a bunch more to go.
