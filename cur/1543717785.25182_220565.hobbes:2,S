Yes, I see oopses with some other modules compiled with native
gcc-3.4.0 as well. No such problems with gcc-3.3.3.
At the moment I can suggest that gcc-3.4.0 generates some new types
of relocations and the kernel module loader doesn't handle them properly.
I'll try to figure out what's wrong there, but it will take some time.
Ivan.
