RedHat is NOT Linux. The MAJOR-MINOR 5.1 used in RedHat for the
console has a very serious problem for anybody doing development
work. If there are any kernel messages, they go to __all__ open
terminals. This means that the only "quiet" terminals that may be
available to kill off a runaway process are available iff you can
log in over the network.
Most everybody I know, who does serious development work, and
certainly those who want to control where the %*)&$#!@ kernel
messages go, will make sure they go to the "ALT-F1" as I have
shown. The original query was about how to make kernel messages
go to where, i.e., what VT do they come from. I have shown
how you can control where they go.
Now, if you look at the kernel source, you will note that
just prior to attempting to exec /sbin/init, /dev/console
is opened. This means that you can properly use whatever
you want if you continue to use a sym-link.
Cheers,
