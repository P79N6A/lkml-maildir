Same symptoms observed here.  The problem occurs within the first 3-4MB
(at least for the two coasters I made).  Works fine with same hardware
setup under 2.2.7.  I don't know what has changed, but I'll be hanging
onto a back-rev of the kernel for a while just for CD burning.  The setup
here is a Yamaha CRW-4416S in an external enclosure attached to a BT-948.
The system's disks are also SCSI, and attached the internal interface of
the same BT-948 controller.
The "retryable" error message doesn't produce any syslog output, but the
reset does:

Doesn't strike me as being terribly useful info, but I've been wrong
before :-).
