I am convinced we need to change syscall table. I don't want to maintain old
syscalls. It will be easier to test smaller amount of syscalls. I would like to
talk about with you (John W) via Skype. (Can you send me private email where you
have time?) I talked with Steve about this week. After that I will publish our
proposed way.
