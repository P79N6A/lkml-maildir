commit 607126c2a21cd6e9bb807fdd415c1a992f7b9009 changed command validation
to allow short commands in 16-byte CDBs, but it also made checking more
strict. Before the change, a 10-byte SG_IO command could have its length set
to 9 and still work. Now it fails. Not sure if this is a bug, but it has
caused at least one application to fail that used to work (qpxtool.)
