One could use cpusets to control the setting of cpu_isolated_map,
separate from the code such as your select_irq_affinity() that
uses it.

People tend to manage the CPU and memory placement of the threads
and processes within a single co-operating job using taskset
(sched_setaffinity) and numactl (mbind, set_mempolicy.)
They tend to manage the placement of multiple unrelated jobs onto
a single system, whether on separate or shared CPUs and nodes,
using cpusets.
Something like cpu_isolated_map looks to me like a system-wide
mechanism, which should, like sched_domains, be managed system-wide.
Managing it with a mechanism that encourages each thread to update
it directly, as if that thread owned the system, will break down,
resulting in conflicting updates, as multiple, insufficiently
co-operating threads issue conflicting settings.

That depends on what more API is needed.  Do we need to place
irqs better ... cpusets might not be a natural for that use.
Aren't irqs directed to specific CPUs, not to hierarchically
nested subsets of CPUs.
Separate question:
  Is it desired that the dedicated CPUs cpuN+1 ... cpuN+x even appear
  as general purpose systems running a Linux kernel in your systems?
  These dedicated engines seem more like intelligent devices to me,
  such as disk controllers, which the kernel controls via device
  drivers, not by loading itself on them too.
