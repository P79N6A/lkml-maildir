Except of course for fcntl(fd, F_GETOWN) where the owner is a
(negative) process group... If the owning process group has a "low
enough" PGID, it collides with errors and glibc reports an error and
sets errno to -PGID. One might argue that in this instance, that the
BSD's overloading of the pid field with pgids is at fault, but the bug
still remains :-)
