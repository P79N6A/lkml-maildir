Subject: 2.2.16 bootp timeout problem (patch)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The Cisco Catalyst 3500 switch has what seems like a training period
of about ten seconds.  Therefore, the default 3*2 second waiting
period between card resets is too small to allow a Linux bootp client
to boot through one of these switches.
The following micro-patch just increases the CONF_SEND_RETRIES (which
says how many bootp packets to send out between reopening the device(s))
from 3 to 10, which fixes the problem.
