I have to confess that I haven't had a chance to look at the code.  Is 
the current proposal set up in such a way as to support loading a module 
and having the new description picked up automatically?

Here I agree.

It may not have any basis in fact, but in practice it seems like kernel 
changes are considered more risky than userspace changes.
As you say though, it's not likely that most production systems would be 
running performance monitoring code, so this may only be an issue for 
development machines.
