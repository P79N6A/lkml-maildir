	Point is that it BROKE some things....  Like "make install" on
RedHat installed the damn thing as /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.15-greased-turkey,
breaking the lilo settings if you set an image for "vmlinuz-2.4.15"
like you expected it to be.  Not funny.  Just had three freeswan
kinstall builds blow up because of that.
	Now got to go back and fix it and rebuild.
