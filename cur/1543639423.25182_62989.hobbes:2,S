Hey all, as promised a few weeks back, I am cleaning up our patch to get
rid of the NGROUPS hard limit.
Here is the URL to the preliminary patch.  THIS IS NOT COMPLETE.  I wanted
to post it here so I could get any feedback on it.  This should work fine
on i386.  Other arch's I am shooting in the dark (there are a couple FIXME
comments - can you answer them?).  Other archs are not complete in this
patch.
http://www.hockin.org/~thockin/linux-kernel/ngroups-2.4-prelim.diff
Summary:
* add lib/bsearch.c
* add lib/qsort.c
* add include/linux/groups.h  (is this better in an existing header?)
* add ngroups_max - sysctl controllable upper bound
* change current->groups[] to refcounted dynamic memory
Comments please?  If I don't have any major complaints, I'll push on.  I
really would like some feedback on the other archs, if possible.
Thanks
Tim
