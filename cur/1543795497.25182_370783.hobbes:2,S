There is a new patch, patch-2.6.14-rt15-rf1,  that adds support for 
robust and priority inheriting
pthread_mutexes on the 'heap'.
The previous patches only supported either file based pthread_mutexes 
or mmapped anonymous memory based pthread_mutexes.  This patch allows 
pthread_mutexes
to be 'malloc'ed while using the PTHREAD_MUTEX_ROBUST_NP attribute
or PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT attribute.
The patch can be found at:
