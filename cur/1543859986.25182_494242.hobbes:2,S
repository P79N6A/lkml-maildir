Subject: What's in git.git (stable) and announcing GIT 1.5.0 preview

GIT v1.5.0 preview
This is not yet -rc1 where all new topics close, but I think it
is getting pretty closer.  I'd still want to merge updates to
fsck/prune to honor reflog entries before -rc1.
I think there are quite a lot of documentation updates remaining
after that.  There is no patch for "fixed HEAD" yet, and while I
would not object people to try to get it working in time, it is
purely a feature enhancement and does not have backward
compatibility issues, so it does not have to block v1.5.0; it
can wait for later releases.  So is sliding mmap().
* The 'master' branch has these since the last announcement.
