Sure. How about:
It's a PITA to break out the dragon book, bloat sucks,
and I'd just rather not have to write the code.
I also like:
Trusting every little status app to not have exploitable
buffer overruns is worrisome.
The more serious problem:
ASCII formats change in unpredictable ways. (see below)

Ooh! You're making /proc NFS exportable?

Disks are slow, so native endian UFS was indeed a poor choice.

This was a necessary performance hack. Hopefully nobody wrote
an X server or client that would do conditional byte swaps
all over the code.

SigCgt in /proc/self/status wasn't always spelled that way.
It wasn't always in the same location either. ASCII bites
because people can't resist screwing with it.
