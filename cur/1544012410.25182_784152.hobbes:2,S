Correct.

i think it got hidden. Apparently splitting up a large kernel linear page 
in IRQ context has a bug. I dont see it immediately what it could be - 
Thomas, Suresh, do you have any ideas?

if 0b8fdcbcd287a1fbe66817491e6149841ae25705 applies cleanly to .27 -stable 
then i'd agree it should be added. If there's lots of dependencies then 
maybe not.
