It breaks on Caldera.
The errors are:

The problem is that the which output is not ignored.
The following patch fixes it:

I personally dislike the 'autmatically detect kgcc and gcc272' patches a lot,
and I think we should put a sentence like
If you are using a distribution that ships with a default C compiler that is
not able to compile linux kernel, use make CC=kgcc (redhat) or CC=gcc272
(debian) instead.
into README, instead of fiddling around with a command/program with lots of
different and incompatible versions.
