Perhaps to you Nigel.  For the rest of us reviewing your patches, it's
much better.  I suspect it would be better for the users down the road
as well.  I don't know if you realize it, but what you're doing now
is, "here's a big chunck of code, take it or leave it".  And at least
historically people have had hard time doing getting stuff merged like
that.
