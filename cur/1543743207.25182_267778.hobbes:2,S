I've certainly tried, but as I'm sure you are aware I have nowhere near 
the level of experience of most people on the list, but I've tried my best 
to ensure that these patches do the right thing, and I've been using them 
on my own box ever since making the first one and I've not seen any ill 
effects yet.
Now that you say the proper fixes are probably "complex and risky" I think 
I'll go back and double check my changes once more this evening. I 
certainly don't want to waste your time with silly errors I could find 
myself.
