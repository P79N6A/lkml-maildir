Well your patch looked reasonable, except it muddies the CONFIG_foo
namespace.  So could you rework it thusly:
- Change all instances of
#ifdef CONFIG_HDLC
	<stuff>
#endif
to
#ifdef HDLC_ENABLED
	<stuff>
#endif
then do
#if defined(CONFIG_HDLC) || (defined(CONFIG_HDLC_MODULE) && defined(CONFIG_SYNCLINK_MODULE))
#define HDLC_ENABLED
#endif
or whatever?
Or, better, (but semi off-topic):
#if HDLC_ENABLED
	<stuff>
#endif
#if defined(CONFIG_HDLC) || (defined(CONFIG_HDLC_MODULE) && defined(CONFIG_SYNCLINK_MODULE))
#define HDLC_ENABLED 1
#else
#define HDLC_ENABLED 0
#endif
Because then a) you'll get a warning if someone already defined
HDLC_ENABLED and b) you'll get a warning if you mistype `#if HLDC_ENABLED'
