   Also the serial divide by zero is still there...
   vis,
     setserial /dev/ttyS0 baud_base 1200
     setserial /dev/ttyS0 baud_base 1200
   (eg do it twice)
This only happens when users don't understand what baud_base means, but
I suppose we should appropriately bullet proof the driver against even
really stupid users....  Linus, could you please apply this patch to the
serial driver?
