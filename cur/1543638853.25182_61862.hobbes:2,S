Well, no worse than the original posting which had reiserfs supporting
something-EB files and 16TB filesystems.  Don't think I didn't consider
this at the time of posting.

Note that I said ext3 in the above sentence, and not ext2.  I'm not in
favour of adding all of the high-end features (htree, extents, etc) into
ext2 at all.  It makes absolutely no sense to have a multi-TB filesystem
running ext2, and then the fsck time takes a day.  It is desirable to
put some minimum support into ext2 for newer features when it makes
sense and does not complicate the code, but not for everything.
Cheers, Andreas
