The might_sleep() in cond_resched() sounds particularly useful to pick
up misapplications of cond_resched().

Well, thankfully we've taken the whole of the preempt-related code in
spin_unlock() and all the other locking primitives out of line for the
CONFIG_PREEMPT case (and potentially more, though that would be at the
expense of x86(-64)).
preempt_schedule() is actually what's used in preempt_check_resched(),
not cond_resched(), and this inspired me to take a look at that. What
on earth are people smoking with all these loops done up with gotos?
I suppose this isn't even the half of it, but it's what I looked at.

Nuke some superfluous gotos in preempt_schedule().
