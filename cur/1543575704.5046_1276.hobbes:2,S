The reboot was about Iomega's Zip Drive under 2.2.18pre21:

Hmm, where? I don't see an (EXPERIMENTAL) in
Documentation/Configure.help:
USB Mass Storage support
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE
Say Y here if you want to connect USB mass storage devices to your
computer's USB port.
This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
The module will be called usb-storage.o. If you want to compile it
as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.
USB Mass Storage verbose debug
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DEBUG
Say Y here in order to have the USB Mass Storage code generate
verbose debugging messages.
Maybe it's only enabled when you set CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL? I don't know, because I enabled
it to just set CONFIG_FB.
