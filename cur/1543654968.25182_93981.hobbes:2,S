That doesn't make it really easier. I want a table like this:
SUSPEND	SLEEP	SUSPEND visible? SLEEP visible?
n	n
n	y	
y	y
All I can parse from above is that SUSPEND=y && SLEEP=n isn't possible, 
but what are the possible user choices and how does the state change if 
the user (de)selects an option?
bye, Roman
