I just got a MCE error while running 2.5.65 "MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, correctable incident occurred on CPU 0.
Bank 2: 940040000000017a" did a google search and found Dave Jones's parsemce, and decoded it to
Status: (ba) Error IP valid
Restart IP invalid.
And was wondering what that actually meant. :) 
Really what I need to know is, how non fatal is non fatal?
