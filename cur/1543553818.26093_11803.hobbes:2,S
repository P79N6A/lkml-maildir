Please base it upon my OOM-Killer-API patch.

This will reduce your patch to an simple module (but you have to
manage refcounting yourself!) and give the user a choice, which
one to use.
If someone provides an OOM-Handler himself, please use my API to
allow better testing and comparing.
PS: Of course it applies cleanly against test10 as well ;-)
Thanks and Regards
