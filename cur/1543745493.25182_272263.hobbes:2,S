If the filesystem a dirty page is mapped against ceases to exist,
wouldn't it make sense to destroy the page?  All such user processes can
receive SIGBUS and crash.  This is sort of a general problem with a
filesystem on a "removable" device like a USB stick, and it seems the
only sane solution is to blow all the mappings against that filesystem
away.
Of course, it sucks since the final result will be a crash, but mmap()
isn't a reliable interface for accessing media that might go away...
So, a reasonable solution would be to detect when a user fs process
dies, and initiate a forced unmount procedure where you walk all the
pages mapped against that filesystem and blow them away.  Similarly for
a case like pulling a USB reader out while it's being written to (you
could nag the user to reinsert, but that might be impossible).
This doesn't solve the deadlock as such except as a sort of
panic-recovery hack, but it seems sensible in general.
