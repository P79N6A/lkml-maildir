Not necessarily. The approach also works without page migration. Depends 
on an intelligent allocation scheme that stays off the areas of interest 
to those restricted to low area allocations as much as possible and then 
is able to reclaim from a section of a zone if necessary. The 
implementation of alloc_pages_range() that I did way back did not reply on 
page migration.
