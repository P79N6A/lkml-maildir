One suggestion was to make all pid comparisons meaningless without some
kind of "container" context along with it.  The thought is that using
pids is inherently racy, and relatively meaningless anyway, so the
kernel shouldn't be dealing with them. (The obvious exception being in
userspace interfaces)
This would let tsk->pid be anything that it likes as long as it has a
unique pid in its container.
But, it seems that many drivers like to print out pids as a unique
identifier for the task.  Should we just let them print those
potentially non-unique identifiers, deprecate and kill them, or provide
a replacement with something else which is truly unique?
