I'm not sure. I know why it causes the NMI lockup, but I'm not enough of
an expert to sort it out. I've got a pretty good feel for the Zip
driver, but not the parport or scsi code yet, so I don't know how safe
it is. The new scsi error stuff does mention that drivers must
spinunlock/spinlock if it enables interrupts.

During the init phase of the parport_pc module it probes and enables the
IRQ(s) of the parallel port, but the scsi layer has them locked.

I agree and it's recommended in the parport code. Now if I can get
enough time, I will take a stab at it, but nobody should be relying on
me for it. :o)
