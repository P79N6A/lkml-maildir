It is not free for anonymous memory as it is overloaded with pointer to
anon_vma.  I think one single pointer consistent across all page usages
is just so much cleaner and simple...

I've currently separated the patches based on where the changes are made
and something that makes each a logical block.  I will reorder the
patches next time so that each subsequent patch compiles.
