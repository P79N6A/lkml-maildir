I don't have the asnwer to your particular problem,
but I can provide a data point:
I play mp3s regularly from an nfs server running 2.4.0.testx
(currently test11-pre5), with client also running 2.4.0-testx.
The mp3 directory is automounted on demand. xmms
plays these nfs-mounted mp3s for hours with no problem.
This same nfs server takes backups via tarfiles on nfs
exported volumes to a mixed bag of 2.2 and 2.4 clients.
The server is of course running the kernel-based nfsd,
and HJ Lu's nfs-utils package. (currently 0.2.1-1)
Regards,
jjs
