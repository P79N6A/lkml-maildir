I'm seeing a problem with TCP as accessed through KMail (SuSE 9.2, x86_64).
But oddly enough, only for sending mail, not reading it; and not through
other (reading) applications... it's a regression with respect to rc1 and
earlier kernels.  Basically, it can only send REALLY TINY emails...
What ethereal shows me is roughly:
 - SMTP connect, initial handshake, ok (ACKed later)
 - Send two 1500 byte Ethernet packets
 - Each gets an ICMP destination unreachable, frag needed, next hop MTU 1492
 - ... all retransmits are 1500 bytes not 1492, triggering ICMPs ...
Naturally the connection goes nowhere.
