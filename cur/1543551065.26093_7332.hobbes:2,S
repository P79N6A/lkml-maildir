Yeah.
One thing we _can_ (and probably should do) is to do a per-user memory
pressure thing - we have easy access to the "struct user_struct" (every
process has a direct pointer to it), and it should not be too bad to
maintain a per-user "VM pressure" counter.
Then, instead of trying to use heuristics like "does this process have
children" etc, you'd have things like "is this user a nasty user", which
is a much more valid thing to do and can be used to find people who fork
tons of processes that are mid-sized but use a lot of memory due to just
being many..
