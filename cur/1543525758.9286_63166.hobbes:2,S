I DO know that hfmodem is not the most used part of the kernel. I DO know
that it'd probably compile with kgcc-2.7.2.3 (although breaking in some
other part), but it's to illustrate that NO vanilla 2.2.xx kernel is
compileable outta the box...
People !!! It's already 15th release candidate (less for all that pre's and
ac's) and it does NOT even compile... "Use kgcc-2.7.2.3" is NOT to be taken
as a valid excuse, it's simply broken... There have been patches addressing
wrong assembly in 2.2.xx in l-k but nobody cared to merge them.
Anyone else for a "stable" kernel ?  Someone to call the configuration with
hfmodem exotic ?  As I do recall, someone here did say that he does compile
all 2.2.xx kernels with all imaginable config combination with 100% success
rate...
I do not even try to mention the parts which are not SMP-safe...
