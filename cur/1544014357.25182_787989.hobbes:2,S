If I thought that, I would say it.

That's STILL not a *reason*.  Nobody has provded a reason.
Here's a reason: look in /proc.  It contains "interrupts", "irq",
"vmstat", "meminfo", etc.  All simple files which provide realtime view
of core kernel activity.  Which is precisely what /proc/softirq does!
So putting it in /proc/softirq is "logical", and yanking it out and
stuffing it in some random other place for reasons which nobody can
explain is illogical.
Plus the patch adds a summary line to the existing /proc/stat.  Which
is also logical.  Do we do that in debugfs too?
