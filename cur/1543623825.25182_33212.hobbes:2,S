Perhaps it could be made a tool thing though. If a cron job could be setup 
on  Linus' master bk repository to do periodic pushes to the web interface 
or the other way round, if Larry would be given access to Linus' master 
repository so he can setup periodic pulls to bkbits.net web repository it 
would become a tool thing, no?
