I'm using kernel 2.4.18-pre9, which has a problem when I switch DMA on 
the IDE hard drive. With DMA enabled, I cannot complete a kernel
compile without the machine locking up. The motherboard is an
ASUS board, with 512MB of DDR RAM and an Athlon 1800 XP. If I
turn the ide DMA off, then I can compile as many linux kernels
as I like with no lockup. This DMA lockup also occurs on other
2.4.x kernels. Is anyone interested in getting me to test a
fix for this problem?

with dma off  hdparm -Tt /dev/hda gives:
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.56 seconds =228.57 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 14.85 seconds =  4.31 MB/sec
