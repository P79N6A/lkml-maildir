I don't know why KDE does this. Probably because of the .desktop files.
   But I can see plenty of reasons to monitor large trees. For example to
keep some kind of metadata consistent with data.
What is everybodys obsession with file managers anyway? They are the
most *boring* application of an enhanced file change mechanism, and
certainly not the most demanding.

This would indeed be an expensive operation. You would need a mapping
from paths to inode numbers for the files you want to watch. If you just
want to watch for changes for a single file or a small subdirectory it
is not that bad though.
Want me to code this into my userspace tool to see what I mean? I am
100% certain it can be done as long as you have inode numbers or
something else to uniquely and persistently identify a file (as opposed
to the name of the file). Unfortunately inode numbers are not unique and
persistent on all file systems, but for e.g. ext3 it should be no problem.

You would get an event. And the new alias would point to the same file.
No problem there.

Strange. I have my userspace tool running on the first console. It is
watching for everything on "/" (throwing away most of it immediately). I
am downloading various stuff with mldonkey, playing an mp3 file with
xmms, and running a KDE session and mozilla.
My CPU load is at an average of 5%. (Athlon 2500+ with 512mb ram)
If the file manager insists on redrawing itself each time he gets a
write event, you would get 100% cpu. But such a braindead implementation
should not be blamed on the notification mechanism.
