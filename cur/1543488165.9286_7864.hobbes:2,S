Check the fine manual page on syslogd, should explain it thoroughly.
Difficult to know where the message came from if it's the first time
you encountered it, I know.  The friend I refer to is a co-founder
of Globalcast and a NASA research fellow - if any would-be flamers
care to tell me that he and I are "stupid", I'll gladly accept the
title.  If a person of his achievement can be "stupid", so can I ;-)
Regards,
Daniel
