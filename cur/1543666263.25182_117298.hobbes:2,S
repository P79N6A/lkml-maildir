Having a product name "confusingly similar" to another one _is_ grounds
for trademark action.  See Lindows, Mobilix etc.  (And yes, of course,
it's a very subjective thing in many cases.)
But simply comparing one product to another is not the same.
I'd expect using a name like "BitBucket" to be much more at risk of
being a trademark infringement than merely claiming that a project "aims
to be BitKeeper compatible" or "can read BitKeeper repositories."
Cheers,
 Stephen
