Currently the stall is triggered if the DMA engine active bit is set, no
further conditions.
Would you concur that it would be reasonable to trigger only if
- the chipset version is < CSB5,
- the drive is a hard disk,
- and the drive did not report an error?
(I am not certain about the last condition, but from the descriptions 
of the 4-byte-shift problem I have seen I infer that there was no drive
error condition involved).
