If one fork/thread dies or goes to sleep for some reason. Then what since
that process has the lock to the video hardware. All the other process in 
the pipeline have to wait. Perhaps indefinetly. Then you start to add a
bunch of what if code kernel side to handle this. I'm looking for a much
cleaner solution.
Second point. What would every happen if another graphics library like
inventor would be ported to linux. Then how do you get both libraries to
share their graphic context state. If other 3D graphics libraries are
ported over from other OS to linux this problem would get out of hand. Of
course we could force the linux user community to use just one API. To me
this is not a option.

The reality is both methods have their cost. I don't want to see a huge
amount of complex go in their. The idea is to bring a clean solution to
the table. Something I'm looking for.
