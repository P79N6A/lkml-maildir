Yeah, understood.  This shortening of timeslice I think is generally
bad, (hmm...) though in an environment where preemption is rampant, this
shortening of slice should lead to a throughput gain for low ranking
_interdependent_ tasks.  Is that what you're trying to accomplish?  To
reduce latency at the bottom in the face of preemption from above?
