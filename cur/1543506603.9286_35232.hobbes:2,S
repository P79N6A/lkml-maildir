Hackers,
I want to know what do activate_mm() and friends are supposed to do.
Somebody (Dave, Linus, or Ingo) introduced these in the end of July.
If anyone has a folder with related discussion please forward me
something.
There's a mail which is somewhat related:
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/1999week31/0810.html
And there are sources of course, but nonetheless my feeble brain
cannot figure all details...
Great thanks,
--Pete
