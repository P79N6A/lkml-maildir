Linus, please pull the latest scheduler git tree from:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
Find the shortlog and diffstat below.
The main body of this tree is about resolving interactions between the 
group scheduler and the new rt_ratio API. This restructuring also fixes 
an -rc1 bug where tasks would try to gain RT privileges that were in an 
UID group by default which had no RT runtime assigned to them - 
resulting in those tasks not running at all.
Furthermore, Peter found that the "ratio" API was a bit unfortunate 
choice (which causes some arbitrary granularity to be chosen) so it's 
microseconds based now. Also, RT group scheduling is now selectable in 
the .config (off by default). These all got a bit intrusive [and had a 
bug that took some time to find] so i kept testing it for a while so it 
missed -rc1.
It's good IMO and most of the code is default-disabled - but if this 
looks too complex our other option would be to disable the new RT bits 
in .25 and do it in .26.
