Yes, there is no official 32bit external entry point. But on EFI
platform, the 16bit entry point can not be used because there is no
16bit BIOS call available. So, I think it is necessary to define a
32bit external entry point.

The kexec uses the 32bit entry point in a user space tool named
kexec-tools, not in the kernel.

I think at least the following should be done to make it a external
boot protocol.
1. A version number field should be added.
2. The pointers (especially these come from firmware) should be 64bit
to make the entry point can be used for both 32bit and 64bit platform.
3. More complete and formal document.
Can you kindly tell me what's more should be done?
