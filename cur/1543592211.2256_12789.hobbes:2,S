well, my new 40gb ones are auto-parking i think but all the other ones from
last year aren't
and older hardware (although 1 year isnt even old for a hd) should be
supported by the kernel, right?
plus, its really not difficult to implement spinning down the hds before
halt anyway and then the kernel
leaves the system as clean as it was before booting ;) !!
