Subject: [PATCH] Fix dirty page accounting leak with ext3 data=journal
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In 46d2277c796f9f4937bfa668c40b2e3f43e93dd0, try_to_free_buffers was
changed to bail out if the page was dirty. That caused
truncate_complete_page to leak massive amounts of memory, because the
dirty bit was only cleared after the call to try_to_free_buffers. So the
call to cancel_dirty_page was moved up to have the dirty bit cleared
early in 3e67c0987d7567ad666641164a153dca9a43b11d.
The problem with that fix is, that the page can be redirtied after
cancel_dirty_page was called, eg. like this:
truncate_complete_page()
  cancel_dirty_page() // PG_dirty cleared, decr. dirty pages
  do_invalidatepage()
    ext3_invalidatepage()
      journal_invalidatepage()
        journal_unmap_buffer()
          __dispose_buffer()
            __journal_unfile_buffer()
              __journal_temp_unlink_buffer()
                mark_buffer_dirty(); // PG_dirty set, incr. dirty pages
And then we end up with dirty pages being wrongly accounted.
In ecdfc9787fe527491baefc22dce8b2dbd5b2908d the changes to
try_to_free_buffers were reverted, so the original reason for the
massive memory leak is gone, so we can also revert the move of
the call to cancel_dirty_page from truncate_complete_page and get the
accounting right again.

I'm not sure if it matters, but opposed to the final check in
__remove_from_page_cache, this one also cares about the task io
accounting, so maybe we want to use this instead, although it's not
quite the clean fix either.
