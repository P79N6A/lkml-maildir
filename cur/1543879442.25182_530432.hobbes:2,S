I've posted on the subject before, and as noone seemed to truely relate
to the concept I concequently dropped my effords, but as you seem to be half
a step in the general right direction, this may be a good time to bring
it up again.
If instead of 'least privilege' and fat profiles, you would opt for 'least
authority' and (potentialy) thin profiles, this would make the whole also
usable for systems initialy designed with security in mind.
To accomplish such a thing I proposed that the non 'at' family of calls
for filesystems should be considdered to be priviledged operations (within
a least authority context), and the 'at' family of operations should have
invocations with uptree path tokens also be considdered priviledged
(within a least authority context). The non uptree invocations of the 'at'
family
should be considdered unpriviledged, and should thus always be allowed
seperately from any profile.
With this distinction implemented, you could than potentialy use thin
profiles and dynamicly exchange authority by passing along directory
file handles when needed.
Where with the 'least priviledge' approach the profile would need to grant
the each priviledge the application might need, but when you would be able
to use both file handles, socket handles and directory handles as tokens
of authorization that can be comunicated seperately and freely, without
being stopped from being used by least priviledge profiles, the profiles
needed will start out much thiner, and will dynamicly expand to just a
limited subset of the fat least priviledge profile.
I believe that being able to be able to distinguish between the
the least authority (no uptree) usage of open file/dir/socket handles and
other operations is essential. If a profile blocks a program from using
these open file/dir/socket handles in a way not violating least authority
(that is no uptree tokens in at family calls), this would be a major
design flaw.
