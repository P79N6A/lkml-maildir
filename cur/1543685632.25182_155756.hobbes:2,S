Some people asked about ext2 so it is in this sample results.
It seemes like there was some interest in the filesystem benchmarks, so 
I have written a better testing script.  Take it from 
http://umn.edu/~mine0057/bench
 .
(You will need scsh to use it.)
It makes it easy to select which filesytems to benchmark, and you get a 
tab-delimited output (so you can import into Excel :).  Also, you can 
customize the list of tests with whatever commands you wish.  If anyone 
finds it useful, let me know so that I continue to work on it.  Attached 
is a sample output.
