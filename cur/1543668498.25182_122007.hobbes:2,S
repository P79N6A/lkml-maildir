Feature: the way tmpfs allows a page to move between swap and memory
makes loopback harder to support than it is for all-in-memory ramfs.
I used to have the patches to enable loopback on tmpfs in 2.4 (well,
I still have them, but 2.4 and tmpfs have both moved on), but shifted
attention to 2.5.  One day I'll clean them up, but that day is not soon.
