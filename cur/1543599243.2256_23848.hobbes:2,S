Randy, 
You are definitly exceeding what the kernel will cache and writing to disk on 
some tests.  I guess it depends on what is more important to you.  I think 
both are valid things to test, and you may want to try not limiting memory to 
get just FS performace in memory for large files.  However, writing to disk 
is important, especially for things like bounce-buffer.  Did you have himem 
support in your kernel?  If so, did you have a bounce-buffer elimination 
patch as well? 
Does the storage system/controller have a disk cache?  What size?
Also, does IOzone default to num procs=num cpus?  I didn't see any options in 
your cmdline for num_procs.
