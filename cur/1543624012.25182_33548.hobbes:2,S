       For a laugh, read the instructions on how to "rename" CVS files. 
       Hint: "Rename" is not the correct word. 
       $ mv old new 
       $ cvs remove old 
       $ cvs add new 
       $ cvs commit -m "Renamed old to new" old new 
       [...]  There are two other ways to rename a file in CVS, one of
       which is described as "dangerous" and the other as having
       "drawbacks." References:
       Note that the way to rename a file in in BitKeeper is: 
       $ bk mv old new 
       No danger, no drawbacks, no hand editing of history files. 
I like the arch way of renaming a file:
	$ mv old new
(Yes, history is preserved, etc.)
