 Yep, the design is clean.  And we can handle it for good devices, for its
additional functionality (e.g. autorepeat of <Pause> ;-) ) and to have a
clean reference design of code.  I see no reason to "punish" good devices
for the faults of bad ones.

 Well, we need not take care of non-standard keys -- as such they need to
be handled on a case-by-case basis (with customized key maps).  The sort
of standard Win keys seem to have a consistent definition across devices;
at least it was the case with the ones I've encountered.
 If standard keys are broken, then we can still revert to mode #2 with all
its limits as we do now.  At least we can disable the translation in the
i8042 to get full and unambiguous scan codes.

 That's actually irrelevant -- it's already an emulation.  AFAIK, we can
handle USB keyboards natively just fine, so we don't need to make use of
this translation layer.
