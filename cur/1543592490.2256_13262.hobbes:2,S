I run cerberus all the time but I don't have locally x86 machines with
>1G of ram so it will take some time for me to try on a real highmem, I
am pretty sure I just tested cerberus with highmem emulation and it
didn't deadlocked for me, I can try again with an higher highmem/normal
ratio later. The ratio I am using right now is half of the ram in
highmem (that is almost the same ratio of a 2G machine):
