It creates a temporary device node in its rootfs. It does so by looking 
into sysfs for major and minor numbers. So the question is whether the 
information is in sysfs at the moment when the kernel requests it.

Because of your own words below that "loading the driver might fail at 
any point *after* modprobe returns" (read: after module_init() finishes).

OK. The fact is that, when mounting the root filesystem, the kernel can 
(?) definitely say "there is no such device, and it's useless to wait 
for it--so I panic". Is it possible to duplicate this logic in the case 
with udev and modprobe? If so, it should be built into a common place 
(either the kernel or into modprobe), but not into all apps.

Then the "char-major" aliases were always broken, do I understand 
correctly? Once we realize that, isn't it the time to mark the 
"Automatic kernel module loading" in the kernel configuration as BROKEN 
or OBSOLETE?

Yes. Now we have a lot of short scriptlets under /etc/dev.d. But I don't 
yet see how these scriptlets interact with each other.
