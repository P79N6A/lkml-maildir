I am no expert on the ppc arch, but in my humble opinion it seems 
strange to invalidate the dcache *before* the memory-writing 
DMA-transaction. The obvious solution is to invalidate the dcache 
*after* DMA completion. It seems hard to guarantee that nobody will 
touch the memory area in question during the DMA.
Just some clue-less comments from a linux-kernel lurker.
