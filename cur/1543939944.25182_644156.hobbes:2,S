Hi,
  I recently upgraded from 2.6.23.x to 2.6.24 and found that whereas
with 2.6.23.x I could have multiple "make -j3" compilation runs going
in the background with no real problems (on a dual-core Core 2), with
2.6.24 I get multiple-second lags when trying to switch tasks in KDE. 
I did a git bisect starting from 9b73e76f3cf63379dcf45fcd4f112f5812418d0a
in Linus's 2.6.25 tree in the hope that the recent scheduler merge might 
have fixed the problem, but no such luck. Instead, git bisect points its
all-knowing finger at 
commit 67e9fb2a39a1d454218d50383094940982be138f

    sched: add vslice
    add vslice: the load-dependent "virtual slice" a task should
    run ideally, so that the observed latency stays within the
    sched_latency window.

A straight-forward git revert crashes at boot, so I don't have a patch to offer. :-/
