doctor it hurts when i...
set clocks to UTC.  local time is an offset computed by libc.  this
will fix your problem; this is the only sane way to run your clocks.
btw in case of dual boot to an OS with a brain-damaged idea of time,
just let the other OS lose.  it can't help losing.  it avoids
dual-boot daylight savings time double clock movement fun.
