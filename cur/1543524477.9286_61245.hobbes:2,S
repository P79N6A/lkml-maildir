I have same problem since 2.3.40. I have tracked it to a problem with "lo"
interface. It seems that after successfull authentication, login tries to
access 127.0.0.1 on port 111. The kernel responds with "port unreachable"
but for some reason login does not see it. Too bad I don't have time to
investigate the problem :-(
tcpdump output, kernel config, and other info are available on request.
