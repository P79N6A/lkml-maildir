Because those are the operations, those should be the actual
function names, too (well, prefixed with pci_).  Architectures
can implement them whatever way is appropriate, or perhaps default
to some ultra-strong semantics if they prefer;  driver writers
should not have to know about the underlying mechanics (like why
we need which barriers).
