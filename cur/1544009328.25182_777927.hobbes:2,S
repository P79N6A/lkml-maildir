Subject: [PATCH 10/13] checkpatch: ensure we actually detect if assignments split across lines
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/7/140

From: Andy Whitcroft <apw@canonical.com>
When checking for assignments within if conditionals we check the whole
of the condition, but the match is performed using a line constrained
regular expression.  This means we can miss split conditionals or those
on the second line.  Allow the check to span lines.
