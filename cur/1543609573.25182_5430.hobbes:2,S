We are slowly Lindenting the -real- tree, actually.  So, no, that
doesn't make sense.  See my mention of long-term maintainability
earlier...
WRT to other code, devfs is indeed being picked on, because devfs
-clearly- needs other eyes, and devfs is so far from current
CodingStyle.
Readability of devfs is IMHO far more important than the readability of
drivers/scsi/random_isa_driver.c.
