Sure, i've rebased it and added this to the front of every affected patch:
[ Based on original patch from Christoph Lameter and Mike Travis. ]
I've also first pulled your latest tree, please base new changes and new 
pull requests on the tip/x86/percpu tree i just pushed out.
I also merged tip/x86/percpu into tip/master and resumed testing it.
I suspect the next step will be to integrate Brian's "get rid of the rest 
of the PDA" patches?
