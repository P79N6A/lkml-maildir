Thanks Paul for taking time off your vaction to reply to this.
I was expecting to see one of your huge mails but this has
exceeded all my expectations :)

Currently the isolated_map is read-only as you have guessed.
I did think of the user adding cpus to this map from the 
cpus_allowed mask but thought the current approach made more sense

I need to set my vi to wrap past 80...

I was hoping that by the time we are done with this, we would
be able to completely get rid of the isolcpus= option. For that
ofcourse we need to be able build domains that dont run
load balance

As i had said in my earlier mail, this was just one way of
representing what I call isolated cpus. The other was to expose
isolated_map to userspace and move cpus between cpus_allowed
and isolated_map

The wording was from the users point of view for what
action was being done, guess I'll change that

It is complicated because it has to handle all of the different
possible actions that the user can initiate. It can be simplified
if we have stricter rules of what the user can/cannot do
w.r.t to isolated cpusets

Yes I plan to add the documentation shortly

Not really. Isolated cpusets allows you to do a soft-partition
of the system, and it would make sense to continue to have load
balancing within these partitions. I would think not having
load balancing should be one of the options available

Absolutely one of the problem I had was to map the flat disjoint
heirarchy of sched domains to the tree like heirarchy of cpusets

I must confess that I havent looked at the memory side all that much,
having more interest in trying to build soft-partitioning of the cpu's

ok I need to spend more time on you model Paul, but my first
guess is that it doesn't seem to be very intuitive and seems
to make it very complex from the users perspective. However as
I said I need to understand your model a bit more before I
comment on it

Nested sched domains are going to be nasty and I am not 
at all for it. Moreover I think it makes more sense to
to have a flat heirarchy for sched domains
