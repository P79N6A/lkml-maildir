Hi.
'Nice display' means that it gives a simple, clean display with progress
bar etc. Al(?) Viro has informed me of the write call. I'll look it up
and see how I can improve things. As I said to Mr Viro, I'm just a user
who wanted Suspend to work better and ended up just about rewriting the
thing. Please forgive my ignorance!
Regards,
Nigel
