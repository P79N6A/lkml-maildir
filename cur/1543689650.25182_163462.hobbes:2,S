Grab the latest snapshot from
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/testing/cset/
 (the very first
link) and see if it's still happening.
If so then please add the `initcall_debug' option to the kernel boot command line and see if any messages such as 
	error in initcall at 0xNNNNNNNN: returned with preemption imbalance
come out.  If they do, look up 0xNNNNNNNN in System.map.
If none of this sheds any light, please send your full .config.
Thanks.
