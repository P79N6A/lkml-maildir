Subject: [patch 2/3] kbuild - remove old LDFLAGS_BLOB from Makefiles - docco update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The LDFLAGS_BLOB var (which used to be defined in arch Makefiles) is now unused,
as specified inside usr/initramfs_data.S. So this patch updates the docs to mark
it as unused. You may prefer to drop the entire section about it, however I
wanted to make clear that this is a change from previous doc versions.
