http://developer.intel.com/design/pentium/manuals/24319101.pdf
Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2: Instruction Set
Reference Manual, page 3-275:
"LODS/LODSB/LODSW/LODSD-Load String [...] Loads a byte, word, or doubleword
 from the source operand into the AL, AX, or EAX register, respectively.
 The source operand is a memory location, the address of which is read from
 the DS:EDI [sic!] or the DS:SI registers (depending on the address-size
 attribute of the instruction, 32 or 16, respectively). The DS segment may
 be overridden with a segment override prefix."
While they're visibly not above typos, I'd be surprised if they mis-stated
anything as crucial as the support of segment overrides.

(Page B-10 in the manual above.) Correct, but a segment override is
a _prefix_ (B-17, B-18), not part of the instruction's opcode per se.

In 16 bit code ? Well, theoretically not, but I'm not sure turning
	mov	ax,es:[si]
	mov	bx,ss:[si+2]
	mov	cx,[si+4]
into (assuming CS == DS, and that ES, SS are a non-trivial distance
away from each other and from DS)
	mov	ds,[extra_segment]
	mov	ax,[si]
	push	cs		; there's no  mov es,cs, and we probably
	pop	ds		; don't want to sacrifice a register to
	mov	ds,[stack_segment]  ; avoid touching the stack
	mov	bx,[si+2]
	push	cs
	pop	ds
	mov	cx,[si+4]
makes the code more readable or more correct.
