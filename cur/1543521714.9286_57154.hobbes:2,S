I mean (cf. below). The results are taken from an old text I wrote almost
a year ago for the Optical-Disk-HOWTO. Kernel was 2.2.2pre4, MO drive a
Fujitsu M2513 (3600rpm version).

It's been a long time (2.1.9x I think) since I last had a closer look at
this particular code. What I basically wanted to say was 'it always worked
for me'. I can't do any test right now as my 95 is fundamentally broken
and I don't have any 98 around.
