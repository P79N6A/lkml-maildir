I am seeing something similar on my dual Athlon MP 1800 box.
It is running NTP to synchronise with another machine over the LAN,
but ntpdc reports that it develops a larger and larger offset relative
to the server - ntpd clearly is not managing to regulate the clock.
It does not have this problem with 2.4 - the time synchronises perfectly.
