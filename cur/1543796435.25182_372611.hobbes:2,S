Well, particular problem I've had: netfilter-enabled machines were
incapable to download large files, for instance newer ICC8 releases,
(major annoyance, their IIS crap doesn't support "Bytes" ranges, so you
start all over if one packet went down the wrong throat). I was told
"try newer kernels first", there had been fixes with out-of-window ACKs
and whatnot. I do not intend to upgrade all of my distro to the bleeding
OpenSUSE release just to find out if the new kernel fixes it and to see
new regressions. I have more interesting things to do with my time than
chase the userspace change of the day.
