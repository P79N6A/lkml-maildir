I've always thought filesystems should mount with noatime,nodiratime by
default and only actually update atime if specifically mounted with
"atime", as it's so rarely used.  Out of all of the servers here, none
actually use atime (every file system on _every_ server is mounted
noatime,nodiratime).  It's such a waste and just sounds fundamentally
broken to issue a write because somebody read from a file.
...But there's probably some POSIX standard which would make such a
change illegal.  Blah blah...
(Not to say that atime isn't useful, but in most cases where it might be
useful, it is so easily broken by backup processes, etc., that it really
wants to be a different sort of mechanism.)
