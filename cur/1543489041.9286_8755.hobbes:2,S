Subject: ipx as a module and CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y bug/omition in 2.2.2

 Hi.
 I'm not a member of this list but I seem to have found a little bug in
kernel 2.2.2.
 The problem is: I compiled ipx recently as a module (I didn't use it before)
and I have (for a reason I don't know) CONFIG_MODVERSIONS on. The ipx module
compiled well but reported unresolved symbols on depmod. The symbols are 
make_EII_client, destroy_EII_client, make_8023_client, destroy_8023_client.
 I looked into the sources and found that linux/net/802/Makefile and
linux/net/ethernet/Makefile don't include files p8023.c and pe2.c as OX_OBJS
so they don't get into linux/include/linux/modversions.h and
linux/include/linux/modules/*.ver, and the abovementioned files .c don't
include <linux/module.h> that would enable them to export symbols as
versioned. I corrected these problems in the patch that is attached.
 Please write me if you find the solution to be wrong in any way so that I
would get to know the kernel a little more. 8-) As I said before I don't
subscribe to linux-net.
 Thanks in advance for any reply
