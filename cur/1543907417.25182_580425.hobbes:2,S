But it becomes an issue should preemption, or control flow upset such
as an early return or recursion, occurs between the start and end
markers.

A better way may be to do what we do in systemtap scripts: in a
interval-start type probe, store the start value in a table indexed by
thread-id and nesting-level; in the interval-end type probe, find the
corresponding value, compute the difference (as appropriate), and
store the result only then into your long-term lookup table.  This
approach requires *no locks* to survive between start & end: the
probes remain atomic.

A marker callback can take shortcuts, I guess, if it allows itself to
make assumptions about the ways it can be called.
I scanned over the thread, but still haven't seen a specific argument
for extra marker-type annotations that would relate to this issue.
What tool would need to scan the available markers, and how would
extra information allow it to do its job?
