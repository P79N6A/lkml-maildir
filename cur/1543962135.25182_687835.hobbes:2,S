Stephen Smalley advised me to add parameter to existing hook rather than
introducing a new hook if the location of existing hook is appropriate.
OK. I'd like to add "struct nameidata" to security_inode_create()
rather than introducing security_path_create() in the next patch.

The MAY_WRITE flag is not passed to security_inode_permission()
if security_inode_permission() is called from __open_namei_create().
Since TOMOYO Linux doesn't check MAY_READ/MAY_WRITE permissions for individual
read()/write() requests, the permission checks at open() time (i.e. may_open())
is the only chance to check MAY_WRITE flag. If I can't check MAY_WRITE flag
here, TOMOYO Linux can't control open(O_WRONLY | O_CREATE | O_EXCL).
Also, the O_TRUNC flag is not passed to security_inode_permission() because
vfs_permission() receives only MAY_READ/MAY_WRITE/MAY_APPEND flags, but
I have to check O_TRUNC flag before do_truncate().
So, I inserted a new hook here so that this hook can check all
MAY_READ/MAY_WRITE/O_APPEND/O_TRUNC flags together in a single place.

This is an inevitable duplication since I want to do conventional checks
(DAC checks and inode operation existence checks) before TOMOYO Linux's check.
By the way, Stephen Smalley thinks it is better to copy codes which is needed by
pre_vfs_*() (i.e. may_create()/may_delete()/check_sticky()) into
security/tomoyo/ directory and leave vfs_*() untouched rather than
extract pre_vfs_*() from vfs_*() and call pre_vfs_*() from vfs_*().
Question to Al Viro: Do you prefer "copying may_create()/may_delete()/
check_sticky() functions into security/tomoyo/ directory and leaving vfs_*()
untouched" to "extracting pre_vfs_*() and making them accessible from
security/tomoyo/ directory"? If you prefer copying, I'd like to copy them and
remove pre_vfs_*() in the next patch.
Regards.
