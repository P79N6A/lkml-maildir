Hi all
I've been following kernel-traffic and sometimes the web-archives in search
for some clues about support for my laptop (jewel jade 8060, specs(in dutch):
URL:
http://www.jewelnotebooks.nl/index.php?page=jade-8060
)
I've noticed some problems and I've seen some proposals for patches and
fixes, but I don't have a clear picture of which is fixed and by which
patch...
The problems I have seen:
- apm doesn't seem to work 
  output: 
  APM BIOS 1.2 (kernel driver 1.16)
  AC on-line, no system battery
  Q: will the ACPI patches help with this?
- the -ac2 patch wasn't able to boot at all (no messages), but I haven't
tried it more than once... the intel speedstep feature would be nice to have
though...
- resource collision on PCI 00:1f.1?
  bootmessages: PCI: Device 00:1f.1 not available because of resource collisions
  Q: any fixes available for this?
- missing driver for smartmedia slot
  (I guess this is a feature request, if it's not available)
from "lspci -v":
02:06.0 System peripheral: Toshiba America Info Systems: Unknown device 0804
(rev 02)
        Subsystem: COMPAL Electronics Inc: Unknown device 0012
        Flags: slow devsel, IRQ 11
        Memory at e0000c00 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [disabled] [size=32]
        Capabilities: <available only to root>
Otherwise I'm quite satisfied with linux on the laptop...
BTW, I'm not on the list, but I do sometimes parse the archives and
kernel-traffic. If anyone wants more details or if there's something I can
do to gather more information, please cc me or ask directly...
Cheers
Simon
