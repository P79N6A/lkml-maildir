Possibly, but I'm more worried about why the fsck did a directory
optimise on reboot, especially on the root filesystem (where /dev is
usually stored).  Doing major fs surgery on a mounted, readonly
filesystem is sort-of safe, but only if you reboot afterwards.
Continuing and remounting read-write can cause all sorts of damage as
the cached fs data no longer matches what's on disk.
Duncan, did you have fsck set up to do a forced htree rebuild on
reboot?
Cheers,
 Stephen
