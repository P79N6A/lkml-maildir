Looks like this one might have been lost.  Here's the renamed version
(it's against 2.6.19-rc5-mm2, which should have your tree in it).

Add a way to disable the timer IRQ routing check via a boot option.  The
VMI timer code uses this to avoid triggering the pester Mingo code, which
probes for some very unusual and broken motherboard routings.  It fires
100% of the time when using a paravirtual delay mechanism instead of
using a realtime delay, since there is no elapsed real time, and the 4 timer
IRQs have not yet been delivered.
In addition, it is entirely possible, though improbable, that this bug
could surface on real hardware which picks a particularly bad time to enter
SMM mode, causing a long latency during one of the timer IRQs.
While here, make check_timer be __init.
