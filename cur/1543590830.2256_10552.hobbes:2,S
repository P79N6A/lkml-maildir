The old C compiler/old Unix linker guaranteed 6 chars in an external symbol
name only, and C functions got an underscore prepended: _creat. I guess
this is the reason for this wart. As to why 6 chars only, I'd guess some
data structure in the linker was laid out that way. Machines had a few
dozen Kbs of RAM then, space was precious.

Old FS handled only 14 chars in names, but that clearly isn't the reason
here (11 chars). Some other operating system perhaps?
