Thank you.
But this:
1. Does not let the user to remove the media (eg. cdrom).
2. Does not flush buffers etc. so the media cannot be safely removed
even if it were physically possible (eg. cdrom with unlocked tray or
USB-key).
I have read that the MNT_FORCE is currently limited to NFS mounts.
Does somebody have any idea why it is limited? 
Or is the functionality planned for other filesystems too?

Olaf
