When I tried undefining NEED_RESERVE_PAGES for MIPS on 2.6.13,
something did not work (I can not remember details...).  But it seems
things have been changed in 2.6.15.  I'll try again.  Thanks.

Yes, there is still virt_to_page() in snd_pcm_mmap_data_nopage() and
snd_malloc_sgbuf_pages().  If dma_mmap_coherent() was ported, former
might disappear but latter might not.  So it seems virt_to_page()
issue still remains...

OK, I'll wait.  Thank you very much.
