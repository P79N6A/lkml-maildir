What's new with the kernel:
	it's up to 2.3.31
	swapping works
	memory size and block device configuration has been added
	a few more system calls are hooked up
	virtual consoles are supported and come up in xterms
	I added some missed headers whose lack caused build problems for some people
	the patch is located at 
ftp://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/pub/user-mode-li
nux/patch-2.3.31.gz
What else is new:
	This is now an official project, with mailing lists, cvs, and everything else 
a self-respecting project should have, hosted on sourceforge.net.
	Rusty wrote a nice HOWTO (
http://www.mv.com/ipusers/karaya/uml/UserModeLinux-H
OWTO.html), and this official project stuff is mostly his doing.
	The mailing lists are user-mode-linux-devel@lists.sourceforge.net and 
user-mode-linux-user@lists.sourceforge.net; archives and subscription info are 
at 
http://www.sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=429
	The web site has been redone, but because of domain name confusion, it is 
still located at 
http://www.mv.com/ipusers/karaya/uml/index.html.
