We're not, that was a bit of my own frustration leaking out; I think 
this whole push to IP based storage is a bit silly. I'm just not going 
to help the admin who's server just hangs because his VPN key expired.
Running critical resources remotely like this is tricky, and every 
hop/layer you put in between increases the risk of something going bad.
The only setup I think even remotely sane is a dedicated network in the
very same room - not unlike FC but cheaper (which I think is the whole
push behind this, eth is cheap)
