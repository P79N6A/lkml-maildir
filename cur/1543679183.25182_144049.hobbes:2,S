At first I tried posting this to linux.kernel, since I thought that was a
bidirectional gateway, but the post hasn't showed up. Apologies if you see
this twice.

Hi! Thank you for the patch. It looks interesting, but unfortunately it
doesn't work very well for me. I have an Acer Aspire laptop with a
four-button Alps touchpad (left,right and two up/down scroll buttons). The
"down" button functions as the middle mouse button, but I've never been
able to get the "up" button properly recognized under linux.
If I apply your patch to 2.5.73, none of the buttons work (except for
tapping for left-click), neither in X nor with gpm, but touchpad movement
works fine, with increased sensitivity compared to the standard driver.
Unpatched 2.5.73 works as expected.
gpm commandline: gpm -t ps/2 -m /dev/psaux
XF86Config:
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
        Driver          "mouse"
        Option          "CorePointer"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/psaux"
        Option          "Protocol"              "GlidePointPS/2"
        Option          "Buttons"               "4"
EndSection
My C skills are pretty meager but if there's anything I can do in the way
of debugging, I'd be happy to.
