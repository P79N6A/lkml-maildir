Don't be so CONFIG_PM-centric :-)
$ zcat /proc/config.gz | grep CONFIG_PM
# CONFIG_PM is not set
This is machine I use at home.

Well, on my ARM machine, with CONFIG_PM=y vmlinux grows by 30KB, half
of that is in drivers/. 30KB is 1% of the vmlinux. Is it enough to
worth saving? I don't know.
On a x86 box, CONFIG_PM=y grows the vmlinux by 400KB (yeah, it's
including ACPI and stuff), though here I didn't count drivers'
suspend/resume hooks contribution share.
