I was just testing some of my parsing code on all the .c and .h files in
the Linux kernel, and I came up with this little equation:
from 2.6.18 drivers/atm/eni.c:1272

                        int div;
                        if (!*pcr) *pcr = eni_dev->tx_bw+reserved;
                        for (*pre = 3; *pre >= 0; (*pre)--)
                                if (TS_CLOCK/pre_div[*pre]/64 > -*pcr) break;
                        if (*pre < 3) (*pre)++; /* else fail later */
                        div = pre_div[*pre]*-*pcr;
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    This could really do with some spaces and a couple of parenthesis.
                        DPRINTK("max div %d\n",div);
                        *res = (TS_CLOCK+div-1)/div-1;

Oh well, this isn't a bug.  Just something that someone might want to
clean up the next time they touch that code.
