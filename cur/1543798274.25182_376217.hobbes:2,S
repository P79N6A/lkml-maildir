I ACK the inclusion of ocfs as well, but not in 2.6.15.
Standalone or not, we don't need to set an example of including new 
features at the last minute.  That just encourages other folks to submit 
new features at the last minute.  Which leads to lack of review, and 
unnecessary last minute work for some.  Do that enough times, and you'll 
be seeing reiser4 sent to Linus 24 hours before each -final release :)
