Please don't do this. We are not in the kernel yet.
acx currently is in -mm, not in mainline.
We have quite a few users of it which aren't using -mm,
but instead compile it out-of-kernel.
We gradually removed 2.4 compat code and most of early 2.6isms.
Even that produced a few complains. Currently out-of-tree acx
is working for any kernel >= 2.6.10.
I very much want to get rid of all remaining compat cruft, and
I plan to do it as soon as acx will be present in mainline kernel.
