I think we should be happy about this. Sounds ok for the problematic 
hardware.

Is this an SMP system? Updates are performed by cpu0 and therefore the 
cacheline is mostly exclusively owned by that processor and then later 
forced to become shared by processors 1,2,3.

cmpxchg is the best that one can do in this case. If you would take a 
spinlock then we would even need more processing.
We can still switch on the nojitter by default if the ITC's are guaranteed 
to be properly synchronized which will make all this ugliness go away.
