Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

the patch below gets rid of io_apic_sync().
io_apic_sync() was introduced in 2.1.104 and it was originally done for
masking and unmasking as well. Later the unmasking use got removed but
the masking use lingered around. I dont think it was ever justified to
do it and clearly since the lack of io_apic_sync() didnt break some of
the other writes we do to the IO-APIC registers, it must be unnecessary
in the masking case too. Maciej?
