Does it matter? The hardware is running a GPL'd project. You have repeatedly 
stated that if a system runs a GPL'd system then all rights to the system 
that the manufacturer has *must* be passed on to the end-user. The 
manufacturer can change the Bios. That's a right they have. Do they have to 
pass that on to the end-user.
Before you answer - this question is *NOT* based on any interpretation or 
reading of the GPLv3. What it is based on is statements you have repeatedly 
made. So no claims this being already covered, and no claims that this isn't 
a situation covered by the GPLv3.
