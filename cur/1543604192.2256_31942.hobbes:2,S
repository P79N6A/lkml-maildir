Well, the two notable difference in the syslog are:
1) Parport now reports that it is going to use DMA 7
   instead of DMA 3;
2) On the second boot ioport 0x530 is reported not to be free
   and this prevents ad1816 from loading
Two questions:
1) Is the parport actually configured to use DMA7, not DMA3? 
   Please check using "lspnp -v 0d" and also by any other
   methods you have access to
2) What is using 0x530?  What's in /proc/ioports?
