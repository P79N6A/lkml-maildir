This is what I did propose. I know of no SCSI device made since 1986 that
has a "hardware sector size". This is really a DMA size limit in bytes
and if you return the number in an unrelated multiple of a fraction, you
will not be able to use the optmium max transfer size.

This is what I did propose 3 months ago and already 2 years ago.
