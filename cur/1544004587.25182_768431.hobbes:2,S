The geode_gpio() users in asm/olpc.h are for some defines that really
probably don't belong there and which aren't used elsewhere in the main
tree afaict from a quick grep.  I'd be glad to send the patch to remove
it :-)

Yes, but having a driver dependent on building for a specific x86
variant is quite wrong.  What would people think about a driver which
was dependent on CONFIG_M586?  Keep in mind that CONFIG_M686 wouldn't
then apply...
