Indeed.
I have a real example from a university core router with BGP and full 
Internet routing. I managed to get in via ssh during the DoS attack. 
We see that the 5 min dropping rate is about the same as the input 
rate. The duration of this attack was more half an hour and BGP survied 
and the box was pretty manageable. This was with a hacked tulip driver 
switching to RX-polling at high loads.

5min TX pkts/s  759          
5min TX errors  0            
5min RX errors  0            
5min RX dropped 47038        
5min TX dropped 0            
5min collisions 0            
Well, this was a router but I think we very soon have the same demands for
most Internet servers.
Cheers.
