There's more to it than "not run out". You have some fixed amount of RAM; if 
the VM is working properly, adding swap will IMPROVE performance, because 
that fixed amount of RAM is used more efficiently.
Obviously, there are cases where removing swap breaks the system entirely, 
but even in other cases, adding swap should *never* degrade performance. (In 
theory, anyway; in practice, it still needs tuning...)

In which case, the VM isn't working properly; it SHOULD page out infrequently 
used data to make more room for caching frequently used files.
