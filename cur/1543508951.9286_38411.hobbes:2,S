Hi!
> Writing a softmodem driver should be fairly tricky, all in.
There are people working on this. You can reach them at
discuss@linmodems.org.
Driver for lucent mars winmodems is under development. (Just now it
"only" dials by DTMF, we have yet to figure out how to send/receive
raw data.)
v34 modulator/demodulator is being developed.
