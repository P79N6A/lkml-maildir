Why is it that a user process can't intentionally switch segments?
Dereferencing a 32-bit address causes the address to be calculated using the
"current" segment descriptor, right? It seems to me that a process could set
a new segment selector, in which case a dereference would operate on a whole
new segment. Is there a reason why processes are limited to a single
segment?
