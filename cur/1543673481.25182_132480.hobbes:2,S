OTOH, since settok wouldn't modify the PAG ring directly, but would rather
jump through a vector in the file_system_type object, it could deside to
confer with userspace and possibly not add a token at all.
Of course then the other calls would also have to vector through the
file_system_type object rather than affecting the PAG directly, but I'm happy
to do that.

This would just be a "standardised" way of communicating authentication info
to a filesystem. What the filesystem then did with it would be up to that
filesystem. Storing a token in a PAG or attached to a struct file would then
just be one option.

OpenAFS has it, but I'm not sure what uses it.

Actually the buffer size. I was assuming the key would be a NUL terminated
string, but it's probably best not to assume that, and I should add an extra
argument for the key size.
Filesystem name can remain a NUL terminated string as I'd have to search the
file_system_type structures.

Probably.
