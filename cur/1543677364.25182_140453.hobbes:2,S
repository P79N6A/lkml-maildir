Agree.

It rather makes a mockery of SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR too.

Yes.  I think we've been pretty successful in hiding the preempt mechanisms
inside existing infrastructure, so kernel/sched.c is a special case.

I completely agree.  I want a non-preemptible kernel to not experience the
gross scheduling stalls: a few milliseconds is OK, a few hundred is not. 
Preempt will always be better, and that's fine.
2.5 should be OK, although I haven't checked lately.  grep around for
cond_resched().  The big pagecache and pagetable operations are addressed.

yup.
