Well, for one thing I absolutely refused during ext3 development to have
ext3 just be an "extension" to ext2. That _was_ how it was originally
thought of, and I very much wanted ext3 to be separate - I strongly felt
that it would be stupid to force people who use ext2 for "stable"
reasons to have to get the extensions (and I hate #ifdef's).
And quite frankly, I don't think we _still_ are at the point where I'd
be comfortable saying that we could just merge them, and everybody would
use the superset of the code.
In five years maybe nobody has any stability worries at all about ext3
code, and we can just drop ext2 and consider it purely a backwards
compatibility extension of ext3.
