Not _one_ central file telling everything, please! Let each driver declare
what it needs and provides, and sort it out from there. Even better would
be something like "depmod -a" that doesn't need explicit dependencies
declared, but that looks like too much hair IMVHO.
Why do I have this uneasy feeling it would somehow overlap with CML2's job?
