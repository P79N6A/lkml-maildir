I looked over the Linux kernel coding standards.  It seems more like C
coding standards rather than actual coding stands for the kernel.  
I did notice the mention that functions should fit on one or two screens and
be short and simple.  Having NOT looked at SGI's code, and not intending on
offending anyone what makes there code more difficult to maintain?  Or more
particularly what makes code difficult to maintain in the first place?
