Neither of these CPUs are multi-core. They're just superscalar cores, that
is, they can dispatch multiple instructions in parallel. An example of a
multi-core CPU is the POWER4: there are two complete cores in the same
sillicon die, sharing some cache levels and memory bus.
BTW, Pentium [Pro,II,III] and Athlon are three way in the sense they have
three-way decoders that decode up to three x86 instructions into µOPs.
Pentium4 has a one-way decoder and the trace cache that stores decodes
µOPs.
As a curiosity, AMD's K5 and K6 were 4 way.

In normal instructions sets, whatever CPUs do, from the software
perspective, it MUST look like the CPU is executing one instruction at a
time. In VLIW, some forms of parallelism are exposed. For example, before
executing two instructions in parallel, non-VLIW CPUs have to check for
data dependencies. If they exist, those two instructions can't be executed
in parallel. VLIW instruction sets just define that instructions MUST be
grouped in sets of N instructions that can be executed in parallel and
that if they don't the CPU, the CPU will yield an exception or undefined
behaviour.
In a similar manner, there is the issue of avaliable execution units and
exeptions.
The net result is that in-order VLIW CPUs are simpler to design that
in-order superscalar RISC CPUs, but I think it won't make much of a
difference for out-of-order CPUs. I've never seen a VLIW out-of-ordem
implementation.
VLIW ISAs are no different from others regarding branch prediction --
which is a problem for ALL pipelined implementations, superscalar or not.
Speculative execution is a feature of out-of-order implementation.

L1 caches are kept small so they can be fast.

SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading, aka Hyperthreading in Intel's marketing
term) is a neat hack to keep execution units within the same core busy.
And its a cheap hack when the CPUs are alread out-of-order. CMP
(Concurrent Multi-Processing) is a neat hack to keep expensive resources
like big L2/L3 caches and memory interfaces busy by placing multiple cores
on the same die.
CMP is simpler, but is only usefull for multi-thread performance. With
SMT, it makes sense to add more execution units that now, so it can also
help single-thread performance.

Itanium doesn't have hardware support for PA-RISC emulation. The IA-64 ISA
has some similarities with PA-RISC to ease dynamic translation though.
But you're right: the IA-32 hardware emulation layer is not a Good Thing™.
