   Not necessary. Just take into account the amount used by the kernel at
the time of the allocation attemp. To the process asking for memory, it
makes no difference who has already allocated memory on the system. All it
needs to know is if it got it, and if so, where it is.
   In how many ways can a program allocate memory? The ones that come to my
mind right now are (s)brk(), mmap(), fork(), exec() and stack. Are there
more?
   The kernel reserves some memory for kernel use. For example the first
number from /proc/sys/vm/freepages. Are there more cases? Perhaps a minimum
number disk block buffer/cache pages?
