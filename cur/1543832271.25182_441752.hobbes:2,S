Well, you said that the compiler is forced to make the memory access,
given the topic of this discussion probably noone assumed that you meant
exactly one memory access. Of course that code is broken, but you seemed
to say that it is not.

The inline assembly works as well, it is made volatile and gcc will not
mess with it.

That wasn't Linus. Arjan suggested using barrier() in the right places.
What Linus did was just pointing out that volatile is the wrong thing to
use and that some inline assembly code had "=m" outputs instead of "+m".
The memory clobber was already there for the locking primitives and
AFAICT it is required.
lock(foo_lock);
foo = 5;
unlock(foo_lock);
// do something else
lock(foo_lock);
while (foo = 5);
unlock(foo_lock);
foo might have changed while the cpu was doing something else, but
without the memory clobber, the compiler might assume that foo is
unchanged. Making foo_lock volatile won't help here and making
everything that requires a lock volatile will get you nothing but crappy
code  (but hey, you can avoid the memory clobber!).
