I'm sure there's enough pages that live at magic addresses that end up at
predictable/identifiable locations on the disk to supply enough "known
plaintext". Remember - the attacker only has to find *one* crypto-block sized
set of bits - even with a 256-bit algo, they only have to find 32 consecutive
bytes that they can identify or reconstruct.
