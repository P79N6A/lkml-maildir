Hi Justin,
	Ok i enabled the second IOAPIC on my system which didn't make a 
difference really apart from changing the IRQ assignments. However booting 
the same SMP kernel with maxcpus=1 (IRQ assignments remains the same and 
devices are serviced by IOAPIC) i can't reproduce the oopses. Here is 
one w/o maxcpus... The reason why noapic worked before is because only one cpu was 
servicing interrupts, however we are serialized per irq line...
