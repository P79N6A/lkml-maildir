Subject: PROBLEM: loopback block device freezes mount

Per /usr/src/linux/REPORTING-BUGS...
1. I am unable to mount loopback block devices using kernel 2.4.2.
2. Using the 2.4.2 kernel, the mount command freezes while trying to
mount
/dev/loop0.  Further, the mount command will not die even with kill -9.
I have not experienced this problem in kernel 2.4.1 and below; however,
I did
experience the problem with 2.4.2-pre4.
3. Keywords: loopback block mount
4. /proc/version
Linux version 2.4.2-jah01 (root@diana.wedogs.org)
(gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release))

5. No Oops.. message
6. The specific command I'm using is...
mount -t iso9660 -oro,loop=/dev/loop0 /mnt/cdrom /apath/animage.iso
On my system, the above command will hang until reboot.  I can change
virtual terminals etc.  However, after the above command is issued, no
filesystems can be mounted/unmounted until the system is restarted
(even the shutdown hangs while trying to unmount all filesystems).
7. No modules loaded (e.g. loopback, nic, sound compiled directly into
the kernel).
Thanks for your help.  Please let me know if you need any additional
information.
