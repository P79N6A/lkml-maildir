I have just set up 3dmd on a SuSE Linux 7.3 file server with kernel 
2.4.15-pre7-xfs (from the XFS CVS tree) and get exactly the ioctl 
error Nathan described with the web interface saying "Error: No 
Controllers Found".
3dmd reports version 1.10.00.020, so the problem doesn't seem to be 
fixed.
I set up a similar server with SuSE Linux 7.2 and kernel 
2.4.15-pre7-xfs a while back, which causes no such problems.
Nathan, did you get any reply from 3ware support so far?
I have CC'd them again...
