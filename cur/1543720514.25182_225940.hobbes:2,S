Subject: Carrier Grade Linux 3.0 availability draft announcement
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello.
I wanted to let this mailing list know about the availability of an
early public draft of the Carrier Grade Linux v3.0 Availability
specification, available at
http://www.osdl.org/docs/cgl_availability_req_definition___v30.pdf
The requirements in this document are aimed at supporting
serviceability of a network element in a carrier-grade environment.
I acknowledge that the requirements in this draft are being
implemented in a variety of ways and many of the requirements in this
document exist in current implementations.  I am contacting this
mailing list because I believe your projects may meet some of the
requirements and we'd like to solicit feedback.
Again, this is an early draft document of the v3.0 availability
requirements spec.  Past OSDL Carrier Grade Linux technical documents
have contained all requirements in a single document.  For OSDL CGL
v3.0 draft releases, we are releasing them as more granular sections,
roughly split on functional boundaries.  These boundaries are
Standards, Serviceability, Clustering, Hardware, Performance,
Security, and Availability (this document).
More information on Carrier Grade Linux and the Carrier Grade Linux
Working Group can be found at
http://osdl.org/lab_activities/carrier_grade_linux/.
Feel free to direct any comments on the spec to me directly at
ikebe.takashi@lab.ntt.co.jp or to our mailing list at
cgl_discussion@osdl.org.
