The first step would be to stop it from being the default (as Trond
has suggested a number of times :-)
How about this.
 I release a 1.0.10 shortly which addresses some 'portlist' related
 breakage and prints a nasty warning if you have neither subtree_check
 or no_subtree_check, but still defaults to subtree_check.
 Then the next release will be 1.1.0 which prints the same warning,
 but defaults the other way - and probably removed the warning if you
 include neither sync not async.
That should at least get subtree_check to be used less.

I think it is a great idea for a 'filesystem' to support multiple
independent file-trees within the one storage set, which is roughly
what you are saying I think (though probably not quite).
However I suspect that most people don't actually want subtrees.  They
just get it as the default.  It isn't something that I would have
implemented if I hadn't inherited the requirement, and no other OS
that I know of provides that particular semantic.
Maybe we should make it non-default, and then in one year, subtly
break it (maybe reintroduce this bug) and see if anyone notices :-) 
(No, that's unethical, I wouldn't do that - really ....)
