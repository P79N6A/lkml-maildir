The problem here is that the current picture is merely a sysfs notification
(like a hotplug event is) and we really don't want to use that for error
handling and other things, that needs a reliable form of communcation.
Here we should consider a new transactional interface which can also carry
binary snapshot data from the drivers.
This is a complete different use and should have something like a event
filesystem (relayfs?) or similar and not in any kind something like the here
proposed printk fallback.
For the hotplug event we use a kind of "payload". It's just the already
computed list of '\0'-terminated environment strings, cause we need to know,
what subsystem we are working on and need the hotplug sequence number.
But hotplug is some special kind of event and every event is still strongly
tight to a sysfs device and all "real data" is available from the device
itself.
The same for the mount event, we don't want to carry any specific data,
cause the real data is already available in /proc/mounts, we just want to
know about the device state change. Then we can reread that data, instead
of constantly polling for it.
Yeah, for the ACPI event, I see that it would be possible to use the
payload model, like we use for the hotplug event, but if we open that in
general to the public, I expect something like printk over netlink.
From my point of view, the kobject, an event is generated for, should be
a "real" device and never a whole subsystem. As long as ACPI can _not_ send
events for specific sysfs devices, I'm not for using kobject_uevent.
