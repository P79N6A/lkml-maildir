All extant systems of this category I'm aware of are 32-bit kernels on
64-bit machines, which we don't really support. Also, the assumption
that physical addresses are bounded by 1ULL << (BITS_PER_LONG + PAGE_SHIFT)
is made broadly elsewhere, particularly in pfn_to_page() and the like.
Making this assumption in remap_page_range() and io_remap_page_range()
would save the overhead of passing additional arguments and/or passing
64-bit arguments on 32-bit machines. Using pgoff_t for pfn's may prove
useful for such systems, but it's highly doubtful the kernel will ever
be made clean for such or that they'll ever be brought to a usable state.
