I think a better goal is "offload 90+% of the net stack cost" which
is effectively what TSO does on the send side.
This is why these discussions are so circular.
If we want to discuss something specific, like receive offload
schemes, that is a very different matter.  And I'm sure folks
like Rusty have a lot to contribute in this area :-)
