Hi all,
	Jeremy had some boot changes for bzImages, but buried in there was an
update to the boot protocol to support Xen and lguest (and kvm-lite).
I've copied those fairly simple patches, and if HPA is happy I'd like to
push them for 2.6.24 (after correcting for the Great Arch Merge of
course).
Thanks,
Rusty.
