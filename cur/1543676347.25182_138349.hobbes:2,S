Hi Bart,
	I notice that drivers/ide/ide-probe.c's hwif_check_region()
still uses check_region().  If it really does want to use it to probe
and not reserve, I think we should stop it warning there.
	There's nothing inherently *wrong* with check_region, it's
just deprecated to trap the old (now racy) idiom of "if
(check_region(xx)) reserve_region(xx)".  There's no reason not to
introduce a probe_region if IDE really wants it.
Of course, some people will start "fixing" drivers by
s/check_region/probe_region/ when we do this, but that's the risk we
take.
It should also allow us to easily get rid of that stupid warning in
ksyms.c...
Thoughts?
Rusty.
