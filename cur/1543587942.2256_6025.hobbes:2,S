Hello.
After an user of us (debian) complained about the "xxx uses
obsolete /proc/pci interface",
I noticed that in 2.2.19, drivers/pci/oldproc.c, line 1042
kernel still writes:
>  printk(KERN_INFO "%s uses obsolete /proc/pci interface\n",
Now 2.3/2.4 this interface is still available and no more 
considered as obsolete, thus this warning should be removed
(and maybe also the file should be remerged to the proc.c
as in 2.4).
