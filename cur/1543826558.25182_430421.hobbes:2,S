It makes a lot of sense...
I think the bottom line for me is simply that I cannot enter system 
calls any way I want with any kernel, among other things because the 
kernel expects that we got into the system call using vsyscall stuff and 
that the correct way to return to user space is also found in the 
vsyscall page.
Thanks for your input.
