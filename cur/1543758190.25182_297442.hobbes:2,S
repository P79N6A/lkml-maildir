this sounds more like an "If unsure, say N.":
You don't need this feature unless you know you need it.
It's not about risk or the actual size of the code - there are many 
small or big features in the kernel that might be useful under some 
circumstances, but even the IPv6 help text still suggests to say N
to IPv6.
