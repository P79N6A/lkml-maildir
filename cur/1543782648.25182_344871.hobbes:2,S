I like this approach better, but I don't understand your particular

First off, if you just did it below the hugetlb check, you'd not need to
check hugetlb again. And while I understand VM_NONLINEAR and VM_RESERVED,
can you please comment on why VM_MAYSHARE is so important, and why no
other information matters.
Now, VM_MAYSHARE is a sign of the mapping being a shared mapping. Fair 
enough. But afaik, a shared anonymous mapping absolutely needs its page 
tables copied, because those page tables contains either the pointers to 
the shared pages, or the swap entries.
So I really think you need to verify that it's a file mapping too.
Also, arguably, there are other cases that may or may not be worth 
worrying about. What about non-shared non-writable file mappings? What 
about private mappings that haven't been COW'ed? 
So I think that in addition to your tests, you should test for
"vma->vm_file", and you could toy with testing for "vma->anon_vma"  being
NULL (the latter will cause a _lot_ of hits, because any read-only private
mapping will trigger, but it's a good stress-test and conceptually
interesting, even if I suspect it will kill any performance gain through
extra minor faults in the child).
