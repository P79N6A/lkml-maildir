Is there somewhere we can download your code?  swsusp in -test3 hung my box 
immediately without touching the disk, and in -test4 there doesn't seem to be 
any way to trigger it under /proc or /sys...
I've been subscribed to the swsusp list for two weeks now and 2.6 has only 
been mentioned _once_, and that was a two message thread with somebody asking 
about it and nigel saying he didn't have time to work on it right now.  It's 
a apparently a 2.4-only list, and I don't use 2.4 anymore.
APM suspend doesn't work properly on my new thinkpad (suspends but hangs with 
the power LED still on and the hibernate light off, and the thing's a brick 
at that point; the only thing you can do is hold the power button down for 
ten seconds or pop the battery to get it to boot back up from scratch.)  So I 
have to shut the sucker down every time I want to move it, which is a pain...
