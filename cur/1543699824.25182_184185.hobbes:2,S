  Hello,
  I have a problem with acceleration on ATI Rage 128 on both 2.4.23 and
2.6.0-test11. If I run X with DRI enabled and some game using it then
shortly kernel starts printing message like:
 *ERROR* r128_freelist_get() returning NULL!
At that moment X freeze completely... Is there some solution for this
problem?
The machine is MSI KT4AVL board with Barton 2500+. agpgart is not
working in 2.4.23 but in 2.6.0-test11 it works perfectly (it runs in 1x
mode). If some more information or testing is needed please ask.
