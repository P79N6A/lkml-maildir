There's some heavy-duty function inlining going on in__kmalloc so could 
you please work out the exact location of the oops as described in 
Documentation/BUG-HUNTING (look for the "use GDB to translate" part).
And to double-check, this is SLAB with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB enabled? Do you 
see this with SLUB?
