indeed.

one trouble with allocate it earlier is that insert_vm_struct would need
to return a -ENOMEM retval, plus things like MAP_PRIVATE don't
necessairly need an anon_vma ever (true anon mappings tends to need it
always instead ;).
So I will have to add a anon_vma_prepare(vma) near all SetPageAnon.
that's easy.  Infact I may want to coalesce the two things together, it
will look like:
int anon_vma_prepare_page(vma, page) {
	if (!vma->anon_vma) {
		vma->anon_vma = anon_vma_alloc()
		if (!vma->anon_vma)
			return -ENOMEM;
		/* single threaded no locks here */
		list_add(&vma->anon_vma_node, &anon_vma->anon_vma_head);
	}
	SetPageAnon(page);
	return 0;
}
I will have to handle a retval failure from there, that's the only
annoyance of removing the PageDirect optimization, I really did the
PageDirect mostly to leave all the anon_vma allocations to fork().
Now it's the exact opposite, fork will never need to allocate any
anon_vma anymore, it will only boost the page->mapcount.
