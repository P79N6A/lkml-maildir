almost.  as i've learned (the hard way), while each patch should
logically accomplish one thing, while you're there, you might as well
clean up other issues *at the same locations*.
in this case, as mr. beer suggests, you should also check if this
represents a kmalloc->kzalloc cleanup (there's lots of those), and
also see if you can replace one of these:
  sizeof(struct blah)
with one of these:
  sizeof(*blahptr)
according to the CodingStyle guide.

p.s.  just FYI, i have a patch that does most of this, but i was going
to hold off submitting it until 2.6.20 had arrived.  but if you want
to take a shot at it, it's all yours.
