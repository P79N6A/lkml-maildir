This is not AT ALL what your patch does. 99% of your patch does other
things, including playing games with the "balance dirty" threshold etc. In
ways that make it look very much like the standard dbench kind of load
cannot use HIGHMEM for dirty buffers very effectively.
There's _one_ line of your patch special-cases GFP_BUFFER in page_alloc
and protects the reserves, but the point is that they shouldn't need
protecting: there's something else wrong that makes them be depleted in
the first place. 
Did you read my email?
