Applied, of course.
I can't for the life of me figure out how we missed this when
we fixed up all the current->pid references under net/.
Ulrich Drepper let us know that the problem existed, and
I was sure we eliminated all such cases.
It is possible we accidently reintroduced current->pid when
we redid all of the netlink hashing. :-)
