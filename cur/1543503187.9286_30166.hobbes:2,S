I would like to help in trouble shoot, pls tell me what to do.My
network card ( 1 x 3c509 and a 3c905 ) can be initialized and
recognized properly as indicate in the boot message. I had 2 machine
falling into the same problem with ac11 ( one compile with egcs and
the other with gcc )
A ping to its own ip is o.k but not to other machines. I even try the
latest 3c59x drivers ( .99L ? ) from donald becker's but the problem
still remains.
A look in ifconfig shows that there are tx and rx packets around (
maybe due to the ping ) but it just couldn't ping out. Everything
seems setup ok as compare to the other machine ( the routing table ).
I actually had a oops when I compile second time without the
firewalls options but it does not response to the alt+sysrq
combination. it seems to stop during init setting up the routing. 
anyway, I'll try to reproduce it tomorrow and hopefully with more
details to furnish.
thanks
best regards
