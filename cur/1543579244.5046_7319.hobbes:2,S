So if I understand  all this correctly...
The difference in ACK generation would be that with nagle it is a race
between the standalone ack heuristic and the first byte of response
data, with cork, the race is between the standalone ack heuristic and
the last byte of response data and an uncork call, or the MSSth byte
whichever comes first.
If the response bytes are dribbling slowly into the socket, where slowly
is less than the bandwidth delay product of the connection, cork can
result in quite fewer packets than nagle would. It would perhaps though
have one more standalone ACK than nagle
If the response bytes are dribbling quickly into the socket, where
quickly is greater than the bandwidth delay product of the connection,
cork will produce one less packet than nagle.
If the response bytes go into the socket together, cork and nagle will
produce the same number of packets.
