ok, i like this one too - i agree that it's better than mine because it 
isolates on a per-API level not on a per-lowlevel-paravirt-op level. But 
this doesnt do the most crutial step: the removal of the paravirt_ops 
export. Without that the module build test is pointless.
btw., your patch does not apply to current -git - could you please 
rebase this patch to the head of your queue so that upstream can pick it 
up?
