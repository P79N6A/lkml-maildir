If you don't want to answer this, then just ignore it, but help would be 
greatly appreciated.
I'm expecting to sell my system soon and then buy a new system.
My current vendor is micropro.com (yes. restricting, but let's just say 
that my dad is paying for it, and this is his current vendor)
Looking for an AMD T-Bird 1.2 GHz.
I need suggestions on which mobo to get.
I'm assuming that there is no support for the ALi MAGiK1, so my options 
are limited to the VIA KT{133,266}or the AMD 760, and unfortunately as 
of today, my vendor doesn't have any mobos w/ the KT266.
Oh well, that's life.
As I can only use one vendor, and _can_ customize but not build my own 
from scratch, I have only a few options.
DDR
IWill KA266
Asus A7A266
straight 266FSB
IWill KK266-PLUS
Abit KT7A
Asus A7V-133
TIA
Adam
