That's why.  I'm using the old HD IDE driver because the newer one hangs
on boot with unexpected interrupts every time it probes for hard drives(
either that or when it asks for partitions).  Alot of stuff I have on it
is modularized, too... may have to post up my .config so you'll know which
compiles.  (It's at 2.2.13str1, stock 2.2.13 with e2c and my sysrq patch)
