Please no.
If there is something I _hate_ it's bad naming. And "pcps" is a totally 
unintelligible name.
Write it out. If a function is so trivial that you can't be bothered to 
write out what the name means, that function shouldn't exist at all. 
Conversely, if it's worth doing, it's worth writing out a name.
