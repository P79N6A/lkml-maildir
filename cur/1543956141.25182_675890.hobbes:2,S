No need to do this afaics: you've already got the better
	if (!phys_addr_valid(phys_addr)) {
		printk(KERN_WARNING "ioremap: invalid physical address %llx\n",
		       phys_addr);
		WARN_ON_ONCE(1);
		return NULL;
	}
in there. What needs fixing is that this returns 1 on 32-bits
unconditionally, whereas the x86-64 definition should also be used for
PAE (and the parameter type should also be resource_size_t).
