nr_node_ids is defined to 1 if you compile a non NUMA kernel.
If CONFIG_NUMA is on, then nr_node_ids is a variable, that is filled with the 
maximum nodeid of possible node (+1). If your machine is not CPU hot plug 
capable, and you have say one node, (one dual core processor for example), 
then nr_node_ids will be set to 1
(see mm/page_alloc.c function setup_nr_node_ids() )
So this is OK for your need...
