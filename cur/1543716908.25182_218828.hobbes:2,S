Using stock 2.6.5, I'm trying to get the Intel i810/5 framebuffer driver 
to work. So far I have had no success.
Any help would be appreciated, system data follows.

I'm using the following lilo.conf line:
append="video=i810fb:vram:2,xres:1024,yres:768,bpp:8,hsync1:30,\
         hsync2:55,vsync1:50,vsync2:85,accel,mtrr"
Relevant Statements from dmesg:
