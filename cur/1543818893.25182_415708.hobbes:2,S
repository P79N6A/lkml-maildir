If a driver for an ISA device only wants to register a device and driver
if the hardware exists, it needs to handle behaviour itself and not force
such behaviour on the upper layers (which is what you're arguing for.)

I never commented on it because I'm not specifically a driver model
person - I just happen to be one of the major users of platform devices,
though I have put forward some changes to the platform driver model to
facilitate getting rid of quite frankly some extremely poor and buggy
driver code (and fixed up that crap code in the process.)
Greg is the maintainer of the driver model, and it's Greg who needs to
comment on changes to the way it works.

Maybe this is the best solution for ISA devices - they do appear to
have differing semantics at the probe level from platform devices.
Maybe this "discovery" should be part of the bus matching method, prior
to the driver probe method being called?  With an ISA bus type, you can
certainly arrange for that to happen without changing existing driver
model behaviour.
In addition, you can check whether the driver was bound by checking
whether dev->driver is non-NULL.
