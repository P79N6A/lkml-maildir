Sure looks like ext3.

Yes.  Although it's usually the other way round. "How come it keeps running
fsck even though mount says ext3?".
Take a look in /proc/mounts.

gack.  I've seen pencils which can write faster than that.
So your wirespeed actually exceeds the disk speed.  That changes things.
The kernel *has* to stall the generator of dirty data.  We can make
the stalls shorter, and more frequent.  Go into drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c
and see where it's initialising batch_requests.  Just change it to
	batch_requests = 1;
batch_requests needs to die anyhow...
And in fs/mpage.c, set RATELIMIT_PAGES to 16.
The application has to block, but the disk should certainly never
fall idle.  I'll play with this a bit.  IDE ceased to be an option
in 2.5.30, which does not aid this effort.

Lumpy writeback is pretty common.  As is bad latency during writeout.
It's quite tricky to get these things balanced out, and it's easy to
fix one thing and break another.  Not a lot of effort has been put into
fine tuning 2.5 for smoothness and latency thus far.
