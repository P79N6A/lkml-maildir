I have an sound blaster 16, but I'm unable to get it working with
2.6.
During boot I get:
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 0.9.4 (Mon Jun
09 12:01:18 2003 UTC).
ALSA device list:
  #0: Sound Blaster 16 at 0x220, irq 5, dma 1&5
Normally I'm using irq 7, and that has always worked for me, but
for some reason it's selecting it.
I'm still using my kernel parameter line from 2.4:
sb=0x220,7,1,5
And I tried some other things, but I'm unable to get it to work.
How am I supposed to get the IRQ of the SB16 that's compiled in
the kernel?
