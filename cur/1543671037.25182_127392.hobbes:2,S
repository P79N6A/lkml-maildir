Users come in two basic flavors - distro based users and people who roll
their own kernels.  For the distro users, it really doesn't matter WHAT
we do, as the distro can patch the kernel and userspace how they want.
If you're a roll-your-own, you don't have to add lines to an rc script
to get the keyboard working - but you DO have to do the CONFIG_INPUT thing. ;)
