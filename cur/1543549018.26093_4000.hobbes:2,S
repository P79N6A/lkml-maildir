In my experience most of the code differences between builtin and module
wind up being due to historical differences between the two in other
code layers, and the driver has to take that into account.
ISA net drivers are similar...  they do different types of probing and
initialization depending on ifdef MODULE, but those differences can be
eliminated for the most part just by using modern APIs..
