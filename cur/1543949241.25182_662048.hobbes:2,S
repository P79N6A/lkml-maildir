Hi!
 Is there a way to enable high resolution timers on AT91SAM926x? The
best resolution I can get (kernel 2.6.23.11-rt14 with at91 patch from
maxim.org.za) is around 1ms. Is there any other way to get timers with
better resolution?
When I enable CONFIG_GENERIC_TIME and CONFIG_GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS (as
prerequisites for CONFIG_HIGH_RES) I'm unable to compile at91 part of
kernel.
Is there any "unofficial" patch? I saw that in 2.6.24 high res is
supported for ARM, but AT91 still lacks support.
