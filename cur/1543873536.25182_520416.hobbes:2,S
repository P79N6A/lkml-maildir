I just did a build of top of tree, including those commits, and
it's still broken.  Booting with pci=nomsi no longer 'fixes' it
though, which may indicate that the MSI changes were a red herring.
(Or that the subsequent changes have regressed it even more,
 which seems unlikely looking at the changes).
.. or it could be something else introduced between rc3 (which is
what my bisect was based on) and todays tree.
sigh. I'll do more bisecting after lunch.
