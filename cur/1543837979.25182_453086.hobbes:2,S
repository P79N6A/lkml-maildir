This is not a driver for grabbing live video streams. The eXcite platform using 
it is a smart camera running linux, and the driver is for a very special piece 
of hardware designed into this camera. Its purpose is grabbing single image 
frames for processing within the camera itself, which is quite different from 
what the v4l2 API has been designed for.
