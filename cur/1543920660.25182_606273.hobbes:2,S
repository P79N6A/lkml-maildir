Imho: not perfect, but acceptable. We can re-introduce cwq->should_stop
flag, so that cwq->thread eventually exits after it flushed ->worklist.
But see below.

Not needed, cwq->thread == NULL because alloc_percpu() uses GFP_ZERO.

OK, this is understandable, but see below...

IS_ERR(cwq->thread) is not possible. cwq->thread is either NULL, or
a valid task_struct.

Unfortunately, this approach seem to have a sublte problem.
Suppose that CPU 0 goes down. Let's denote the corresponding cwq->thread as T.
When CPU goes offline, T is not bound to CPU 0 any longer. So far this is OK.
Now suppose that CPU 0 goes online again. There is a window before CPU_ONLINE
(note that CPU 0 is already online at this time) binds T back to CPU 0. It is
possible that another thread running on CPU 0 does schedule_work() in that window,
or it can run on any CPU but calls schedule_delayed_work_on(0).
In this case the work_struct may run on the wrong CPU because T is ready to
execute the work_struct, this is bug. work->func() has all rights to expect
that cwq->thread is bound to the right CPU.
Let's take cache_reap() as an example. It is critical that this function is
really "per cpu", otherwise it can use the wrong per-cpu data, and even the
last schedule_delayed_work() is not reliable.
(Sorry, have no time to read the other patches now, will do on weekend).
Oleg.
