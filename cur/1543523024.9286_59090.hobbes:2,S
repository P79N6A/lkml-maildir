Agreed. Right now, being the kernel cycle quite long, if you're
out of sync, it can be by 6 months or more. I'm proposing a way to
reduce this (halven it), without shortening the devel cycle of a 
single kernel branch.

Yes. Or better, a way to offer the right kernel to the right developer.
An almost mature one to developers with an almost mature project.
A young one to developers that are just starting. The latter easily
becomes the former, of course (at later time)...

Yes, and that's somewhat another mistake. Too many changes on a single
kernel. Being so many, they can't happen all at the same time, of course.
Yet they have to make them, since the next devel is so far away in the 
future. Delaying the 32-bit UID's to 2.5 does not make sense, right now.
Following my schema, 2.5'd be much closer (and of course 2.6, too).
Moving such (late) changes to the soon-to-come 2.5 would make sense.
And there'd be less to be tested on 2.3, so good chances of having a
stable 2.4.early. Almost all advantages of a short devel cycle apply
here. Still the devel cycle is about the same in lenght. You just
spread the efforts. Of course this way you've got less man-time per branch.
That's why it takes almost the same to make half of the changes.
It's no magic at all. Just make life a bit easier for developers.

Right now, I agree it's impossible. If you have always two kernels to
choose, it's somewhat easier.

I've never said i want to shorten the devel cycle. I'm just claiming
my schema has almost the same advantages. Of course there's a price 
to pay, but it's not the one of a much shorter devel cycle.
For each release, call it x.2y, the time between the first x.2y-1 and
the first 2.2y is almost the same it is now. It's just that 2.2y+1
will start much before it does now.

I'm just considering the worst case. Of course this means overestimating
on the general case. I DO think that most of the kernel is modular, 
and so things can be easily ported to later releases...
but there are things that can't be ported, and there we will fail.

You see. Suppose it happened 6 months before. ReiserFS people,
being far from release-ready, could handle that much better. And by
the time the page cache and ext2 changes were ready, 2.5 could be there.
No need to change the 2.3 the ReiserFS people were working on.
I don't know what the (time) distance is between 2.3.25 and 2.2.5.
Maybe it's close enough to 6 months to fit my schema well.

Agreed. Ingo is not more scalable than Linus is.
