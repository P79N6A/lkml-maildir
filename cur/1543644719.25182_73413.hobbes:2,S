Many Linux distributions configure syslog to use synchronous writes
for each logged line, which caused very high load on busy systems
I've seen.
Go through your /etc/syslog.conf and change every "/var/log/messages"
to "-/var/log/messages", the minus enables asynchronous writes.
Also try disabling logging for Apache at all for some time (set ErrorLog,
AccessLog or CustomLog to /dev/null) and see what happens.
