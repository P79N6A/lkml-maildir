I'm confused again, sorry, these paths would be on the remote machine in 
such a case surely?

There is no good way for a shell script to find out where it is, that's 
always been true on Linux and fixing it wasn't a goal of the patch as it 
can be easily done in userspace using a little stub program.
It'd definitely be nice to fix it though.

Yes. I don't think that can be fixed in a general way. Again I guess the 
solution would be "don't do that". Maybe the patch could be adapted so 
/proc/self/exedir is not available for suid root programs, to stop 
people making that mistake. Ditto for the fd passing scheme.

I guess you are referring to autopackages - whilst simplifying 
relocatability will certainly help junior programmers build such things, 
they're designed to be built or maintained by the original authors of 
the programs themselves (unlike other package formats). Because anybody 
can build them on their own systems, they can be treated like source 
tarballs and maintained as a team.
Allowing packages to be correctly built taking into account the 
subtleties of the software was one of the motivations behind developing 
autopackage ...
