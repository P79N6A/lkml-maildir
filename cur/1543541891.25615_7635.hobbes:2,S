Actually the reason is `weak' symbols in the System.map on alpha,
which looks like this:
                 w alcor_mv
                 w alphabook1_mv
....
                 w xl_mv
                 w xlt_mv
fffffc0000800000 A swapper_pg_dir
....
depmod seems to break on symbols without addresses.
I posted Makefile patch removing these symbols from System.map,
but vger was down at that time.
