"Implementations may support additional errors not included in this
list, may generate errors included in this list under circumstances
other than those described here, or may contain extensions or
limitations that prevent some errors from occurring. The ERRORS
section on each reference page specifies whether an error shall be
returned, or whether it may be returned. Implementations shall not
generate a different error number from the ones described here for
error conditions described in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, but
may generate additional errors unless explicitly disallowed for a
particular function."
Not listing an error in the spec does not mean it cannot occur.
Especially EFAULT is not usually listed.
