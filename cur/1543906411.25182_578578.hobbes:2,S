Yeah, there might be some risk of solving that problem at the expense of
people with tons of clients all matching *.example.com.  The actual
export objects are actually pretty small--68 bytes, last I checked?
You'd also need two upcalls to mountd per client (for ip address and
export, as opposed to just ip address).  I don't know what other costs
there might be.
What about the idea of hashing the comma-delimited list and passing
that?  You'd want hash large enough to be collision-free--might as well
use some cryptographic hash, I guess, though it may be mild overkill.
Is there any reason why that wouldn't work?
Could you remind me what problems you were trying to fix with your rmtab
cleanup?
