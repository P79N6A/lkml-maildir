Silicon Systems CompactFlashes are the among the most reliable
CompactFlashes I have used in embedded devices. See also
http://www.siliconsystems.com/silicondrive/whitepapers/SSWP03-Endurance-R.pdf
for a whitepaper that explains their wear leveling and error
correction algorithms. Furthermore, Silicon Systems has a technology
called SiSMART that allows to monitor by how far the CompactFlash is
worn out, such that it can be monitored whether or not it is time to
replace the CompactFlash. (Note: I am not affiliated in any way to
Silicon Systems.)
