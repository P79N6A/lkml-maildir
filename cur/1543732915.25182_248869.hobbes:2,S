All this does is stop fork().  I'm not sure, but most shellcodes I've seen
don't bother forking, they just execve() a shell....
It doesn't stop a buffer overflow that does this:
	f1 = open("/bin/bash");
	f2 = open("/tmp/bash", O_CREAT);
	while ((bytes = read(f1,buffer,sizeof(buffer))) > 0)
		write(f2,buffer,bytes);
	fchmod(f2,4775);
	close(f1); close(f2);
Papering over *that* one by restricting fchmod just means the exploit needs to
append a line to /etc/passwd, or create a trojan inetd.conf or crontab entry,
or any of the other myriad ways a program can leave a backdoor (there's a
*reason* SELinux ends up with all those rules - this isn't an easy task)...
Remember - just papering over the fact that most shellcodes just execve() a
shell doesn't fix the fundemental problem, which is that the attacker is able
to run code of his choosing as root.
