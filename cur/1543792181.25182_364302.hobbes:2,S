1) This is not a kernel problem. It's probably not a linux-net problem either.
In fact, it's almost certainly a user error.
2) RedHat 9.0 has been unsupported for a long time - I suggest an upgrade
to either RedHat Enterprise Linux 4.1, CentOS 4.1, or Fedora Core 4, depending
on your religious beliefs.

know how to fix this guy's PPP problem?" and forwarding the mail.  Stupid disclaimer.
