Same thing on my ASUS P5B-E Plus. sky2 worked with 2.6.20/2.6.21-rc[1-7]
but 2.6.21 final killed it.
Regarding the alleged data corruption issues: I regularly do
multi-gigabyte data transfers over my lan to my P5B-E Plus,
followed by md5sum integrity checks, and I've never seen the
P5B-E Plus' sky2 cause any problems.
