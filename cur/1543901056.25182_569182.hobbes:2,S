Hello,
A while back a patch was merged to make that only root can program the
keyboard:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=0b360adbdb54d5b98b78d57ba0916bc4b8871968
Is this patch discussable? I think this patch isn't proper because of the
following reasons:
* Users can play games in many ways. They can configure the terminal
  settings, (remove the automatic line feed, disable the echo etc). They can
  load console fonts. They can still put the keyboard in raw mode, etc.
* All of these games can be prevented by making mingetty (or whatever getty
  is used) or PAM can put the console into a known state after logout.
* All of these games are annoyances, system security is not compromised.
* I do not see a problem with for example a French user doing a "loadkeys
  fr" if that allows hims to use the computer easier.
Worst issue for me though, is that KDSBENT is needed to be able to catch
keys like shift+tab, alt+fx, escape without delay. My application suddenly
needs root permissions to work properly. The alternative, semi raw mode,
has the disadvantage that you need to implement your own keymaps (like X).
In short, this change breaks applications.
