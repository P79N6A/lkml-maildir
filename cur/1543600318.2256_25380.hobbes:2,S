well, 
try these:
first start with a ckfs of your root filesystem, that'd be:
# ckfs /dev/hdax 
for ide systems where x is usually 1-4
 or 
# ckfs /dev/sdax
for scsi systems where x is 0-6
if no troubles reported, the I'd suggest that you check some of the important 
files for sign of tampering ( /etc/passwd /etc/shadow )
if no tampering is evident, then check to see if you can boot the machine by 
giving lilo a command line (right as the machine boots, you get the lilo 
prompt (or you have to press CTRL-X to get it):
lilo: linux init=/sbin/init 
if this boots the machine, then all that is needed is to add this paramater 
to lilo.conf:
append = "init=/sbin/init"
and then rerun lilo.
if it's something else, I  need more info.
good luck
Fred
