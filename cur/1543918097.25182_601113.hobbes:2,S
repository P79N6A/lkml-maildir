Probably just as pregnant of a plan, what about looking for the
reset_devices being none-zero? It was introduced for kdump to address
the problem with devices that maintain state outside of the driver and
the intent is to have it always set in the kdump kernel context.
Personally, I'd code the driver to acquire memory normally, and have a
backup plan to acquire less should the allocation fail in a memory
limited environment ;-/
