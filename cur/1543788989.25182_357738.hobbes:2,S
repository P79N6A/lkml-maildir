Sure thing. I'm actually just trying to be helpful since I'm pretty
experienced at debugging kernels and noticed a few issues with the VM on
the unit I have - guess I'll have to wait before I can debug those -
there's also a couple of problems with the audio driver.
There's a suspicious looking connector in the battery compartment that
might well be JTAG. In any case, I'm confident that if I actually opened
this unit I could figure out the changes you've made to the reference OMAP.
But I'll wait because I don't want to take this unit apart :-)
Jon.
