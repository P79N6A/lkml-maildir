Different U320 drives of the same make/model, or different makes and models?
The driver cannot "fake" a device returning an internal target failure
error.  I have only seen this on certain U320 Seagate drives and my
understanding is that it is a drive firmware problem exposed under high
transaction loads.
The locking max tag count diagnostic is normal.  It means that the
driver has determined the maximum queue depth of your disk.

I bet there is less I/O going to the drives too.

The RAID controller will eat these messages.  Remeber that it only
*emulates* a SCSI controller.  It doesn't always act like one.

Beat up on your driver vendor?
