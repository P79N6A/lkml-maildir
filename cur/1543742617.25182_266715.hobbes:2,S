Hi, in the meantime i also booted into P9 again and the results differ
dramatically. Much better in P9. Anyways, i reuploaded the tarball. The
program tries to detect missed irq's now and counts the total number of
irq's delivered by /dev/rtc. Since the program does not recover from missed
irq's the "statistical" data for these runs is useless [except for the
knowledge of the fact that one or more irq was missed :)]
