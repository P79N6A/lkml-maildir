It's a little bit more convoluted than that.  Module reference count of
zero doesn't indicate that there is no one referencing the module.  It
just means that the module can be unloaded.  ie. There still can be any
number of kobjects with release function backed by the module but as
long as all of them can be deleted and released by module exit function,
the module is unloadable at that point.
IOW, module reference count does not count number of objects depending
on the module.  It counts the number of active usages of those objects.
