Hi,
I have a driver/module that complains when I insmod it. There are some
unresolved symbols. When I do a cat /proc/ksyms I can see the symbols are
there but they have _Rsmp_xxxxxxxx appended to them. I'm working on a
Caldera OpenLinux machine with kernel 2.2.10 (SMP support compiled in). I am
using the -D__SMP__ define (along with 'regular' flags). I presume there is
something wrong with the linking. I am building my module on its own (not in
the Linux source tree).
Can anyone drop any hints?
