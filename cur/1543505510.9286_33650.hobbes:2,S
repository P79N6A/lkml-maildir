I didn't try the already posted patches, but if it is not already the case
I'd suggest to make the behaviour configurable by madvice, you know:
int madvise(void *addr, size_t len, int behav)
with behaviour like:
    MADV_NORMAL The system provides no further special treatment for the
                memory region.
    MADV_RANDOM The system expects random page references to that memory
                region.
    MADV_SEQUENTIAL The system expects sequential page references to that
                memory region.
the next are nice, but not as important.
    MADV_WILLNEED The system expects the process will need these pages.
    MADV_DONTNEED The system expects the process does not need these
                  pages.
    MADV_SPACEAVAIL The system will ensure that memory resources are
                  reserved.
errno values ar EINVAL or ENOSPC for MADV_SPACEAVAIL, it return 0 or -1
for error.
I was told somehow the origins of this function might be BSD, so it might
be worthwhile to support. I saw it in many unixes but it is usually
documented to have no effect at all.
