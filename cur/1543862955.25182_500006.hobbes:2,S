Subject: Kernel headers - linux-atm userspace build broken by recent change; __be16 undefined

Don't know exactly when this change went in, but it's not in 2.6.18.3 
and is in 2.6.19.2+
  $ diff linux/include/linux/if_arp.h linux-2.6/include/linux/if_arp.h

This causes the linux-atm userspace compile to fail like this:
In file included from arp.c:19:
/usr/include/linux/if_arp.h:133: error: expected 
specifier-qualifier-list before '__be16'
I guess if_arp.h needs to include include/linux/byteorder/big_endian.h?
