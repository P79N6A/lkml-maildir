Hello all, 
I seem to be having serious issues with 2.4.13.
After recompiling and rebooting everything seemed to work fine, but
after having a break to watch Buffy, things seemed to stop
working... 
Every time i tried to do anything i got the same error....
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dynamic-link.h: 62: elf_get_dynamic_info: Assertion `! "bad dynamic tag"' failed!
I am assuming that this is a very bad thing? It stopped me from doing
anything much. Processes which were already running seemed to be
fine (I was in KDE with mozilla and XMMS running), but other things
like 'w' and ppp no longer worked. I also couldn't reboot cleanly by
using Ctrl+Alt+del.
The problem wasn't happening straight away, but after somewhere
between 10 and 70 minutes of uptime.... 
Am I the only one? I am running a Tbird 900 with 128MB RAM,
debian-unstable. The same kernel configuration (updated with make
oldconfig) worked absolutely fine with 2.4.12.
Yours, 
Tim Nicholas
