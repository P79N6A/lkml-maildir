And can you compile programs and leave disks spun down?
That's logic I use in bdflush-1.6:
If it ever decides to sleep disks, it sync()'s and stops bdflush. On
first read, disks are spun up and it sync()'s.
This way, you can actually _work_ [compile programs, run them, debug
them, ...] with your computer while disks are spun down. Of course, if
your kernel crashes while disks are spun down, you loose arbitrary
ammount of data. [Powerfails are not a question on notebooks.]
