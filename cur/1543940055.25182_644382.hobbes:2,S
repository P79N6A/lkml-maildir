lkml is the right mailing list for reporting Linux bugs.
this is an extermely harmful trend i've seen lately: some kernel hackers 
going out on a limb directing the flow of bugreports _away_ from lkml, 
by suggesting to testers that lkml is somehow inappropriate for 
reporting Linux kernel bugs.
It's not even the standard "I Cc:-ed netdev, maybe they are interested 
in this" message but the above, plain incorrect: "this is the wrong 
mailing list" message.
Mikael, what you do is as harmful to Linux as if you were intentionally 
putting bugs into the kernel source. In fact it's more harmful because 
it is irreversible: bugs you put into Linux i can fix and i can review 
all past patches you did to undo the damage - tester attention and 
feedback you redirect we cannot direct back. Stop it!
