I have a simple patch to do exactly that. Contact me if you want it.

I use ide-scsi + st for my Seagate ATAPI tape drive, so I welcome
your initiative. ide-tape has had many reliability problems in the
2.4 kernels, and the 2.5 bio changes left it broken from 2.5.12 or
so to 2.6.0-test<late>. It may have been repaired lately, but I for
one don't trust that code base any more.
