CaT <cat@zip.com.au> suggested /dev/ones, which sounds as good a suggestion
as any to me.
The big question, however, is thus:  where in the kernel tree does the code
for /dev/zero live?  I had a look through some obvious files, and grepped
through most of the rest.  I had assumed it would be in the character mode
device drivers, but unless I'm blind (a distinct possibility) it doesn't
seem to be there.
Obviously, I'm not a kernel hacker -- but cloning /dev/zero to /dev/ones sounds
like it might be an ideal first kernel project.  :)
