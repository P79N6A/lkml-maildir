Sorry, *more* common.

It would have been harder to detect SLUB vs SLAB regressions if they
had been forced to bisect (which could lead eg. to CFS, or GSO), rather
than select between two allocators.
And... IIRC, the Intel guys did make a stink but it wasn't considered
so important or worthwhile to fix for some reason? Anyway, the fact is
that it hadn't been fixed in SLUB. Hmm, I guess it is a significant
failure of SLUB that it hasn't managed to replace SLAB by this point.
