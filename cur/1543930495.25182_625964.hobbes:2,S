Hm, I would have said that the root cause was that Nick removed the
vaddr parameter from the function parameters:
-static struct page*
-videobuf_vm_nopage(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long vaddr,
-		   int *type)
+static int
+videobuf_vm_fault(struct vm_area_struct *vma, struct vm_fault *vmf)
 {
Should the function now produce 'vaddr' internally?

Yep, unless someone else is already doing so...
