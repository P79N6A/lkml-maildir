Subject: [PATCH] NFS Server performance and 8139too
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Since 2.2.19 I have a very poor NFS server performance on Linux 
using 8139too driver (v0.9.14) while the driver v0.9.10 from 2.2.18 
works fine (even with 2.2.19)
I have checked 2.2.20pre2 and 8139too project pages and found no patches
for the problem. Am I alone with that bad NFS performance here?
My setup:
PII-500, 196M, Linux 2.2.19. rh6.2, 8139too, 
serves as NFS server and client for SCO OpenServer and file server and
client
for macintosh
the following command on SCO:
sco# cat /mnt/linux/one-megabyte-file > /dev/null 
takes about 30 minutes with 2.2.19 kernel and about 0.3 secs on 2.2.18.
(I have never made the real benchmarks, numbers are just to show the 
difference)
The following one line patch puts performance of 2.2.19 back to
2.2.18 for me and I use it for a week without any problems.
Beware that I am not a kernel hacker so the patch can be completely 
wrong. But I hope it still can provide some useful information to 
somebody  who really knows what is going on here :)
