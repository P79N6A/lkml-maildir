Hmm.. just realized that there is a new system call.

In include/linux/getcpu.h we have
/* Cache for getcpu() to speed it up. Results might be upto a jiffie
   out of date, but will be faster.
   User programs should not refer to the contents of this structure.
   It is only a cache for vgetcpu(). It might change in future kernels.
   The user program must store this information per thread (__thread)
   If you want 100% accurate information pass NULL instead. */
struct getcpu_cache {
	unsigned long t0;
	unsigned long t1;
	unsigned long res[4];
};
So this means that the contents of getcpu_cache will look completely
different if a process runs in 32bit mode or 64bit mode. Even if you're
saying "user programs should not..." this looks odd to me.
Is this really on purpose and do you really think that no user space
application will ever rely on the format of getcpu_cache?
