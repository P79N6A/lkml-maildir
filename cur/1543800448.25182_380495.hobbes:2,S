I wonder what made you describe me as a fanatic based on my posting? My
posting was not about license at all, it was about the non-debugability
and the wasting of time (compared to spending time on bugs where the
developer does have a chance). Maybe you're one of those nvidia fanatics
who wants to demand that all kernel developers spent all their time on
your toy without you having to pay anything, even if it's not a useful
way for these people to spend their time in general. 
(see how easy it is to name someone a fanatic? :)
