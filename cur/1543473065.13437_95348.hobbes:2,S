What's wrong with the following C code being run as a usermode
program?
#include <stdio.h>
void main(int argc,char *argv[]) {
    unsigned int N;
    while (1)
	for (N=1; N<argc; N++)
	    vfprintf( "%s ", argv[N] );
}
Save that as wildecho.c and compile it, then do...
wildecho This is a test > /tmp/stupidity
...and watch your /tmp partition fill up with a single line file...
Best wishes from Riley.
