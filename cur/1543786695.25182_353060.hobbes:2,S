Very strange.  I cannot find this patch at all in my email folders.
Can someone resend it to me?

Worried now!
If this patch is needed, something VERY VERY WRONG is going on.  This 
patch indicates that the queueing state machine has been violated, and 
something is trying to IGNORE the command synchronization :(
Further, you cannot always assume that msleep() is valid in that 
context.  It should be the caller that waits (libata suspend code), not 
ata_do_simple_cmd() itself.
Does anyone have a link to James Bottomley's proposed patch?  That one 
seemed to do what was necessary -- send a SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE command then 
turn it over to the LLD for further suspend.

Once we get a decent patch, I can merge it into my libata-dev.git 
repository, which is automatically propagated to -mm.
