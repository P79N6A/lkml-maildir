Well, if there's another user of VT instructions, then we certainly need 
to have something central to coordinate it.  No API can prevent this, at 
some point we'll forced to use common sense.

Yes.

We don't want you jarred, do we? I'll prepare a non-kvm-specific patch 
for review later on.  But I can't bring myself to do a single generic 
hook (it's impossible to use correctly); it will be an hlist-based thing.
