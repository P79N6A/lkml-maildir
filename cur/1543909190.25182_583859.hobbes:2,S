Well, to be fair, he's CCing the addresses in the individual entries which 
is at least somewhat of a reason. Yes, could've worked via preparation via 
private mail as well or something but hey, posting some 600 patches is at 
least incredibly funny :-)
Only thing left now is to now teach Linus's copy of git about these entries 
so that it doesn't turn into an wholy incomplete, obsolete mess through 
addition, removal and movement of files in a few months time...
