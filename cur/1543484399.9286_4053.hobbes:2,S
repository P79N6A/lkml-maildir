Look at unit 'u' in inode structure in fs.h
You see that pipe_inode_info and socket share space with filesystem
specific information.
Now, the problem:
You create pipe or socket and use it. Then you chmod or chown it.
VFS functions notify_change and write_inode are called. These functions
expect filesystem information in union u, but it was overwritten.
On ext2 and ufs it doesn't cause trouble because only __u32 i_data[15] is
overwritten and it's not used in pipes and sockets. But if someone swaps
items in ext2_inode_info or if pipe_inode_info grows to more than 60
bytes, inode will be corrupted.
On my r/w HPFS it causes problems.
