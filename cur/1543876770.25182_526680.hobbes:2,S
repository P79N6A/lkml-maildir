I doubt whether we can kill it in migration_thread, since that is
another thread which is unfrozen for hotplug (stop_machine relies on its
services while rest of the world is frozen).

Will think of that.

Ah yes ..

I suspected that we cannot modify p->flags just like that. How abt
moving freezer exemption bits to a separate field, which is protected by
task_lock?

Yep. I guess these are a class of freezer deadlocks very similar to vfork
parent waiting on child case. I get a feeling these should become common
outside of kthread too (A waits on B for something, B gets frozen, which
means A won't freeze causing freezer to fail). Can freezer detect this
dependency somehow and thaw B automatically? Probably not that easy ..

Ok ..sure.
