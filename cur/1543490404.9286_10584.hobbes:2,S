  9:13pm  up 23 days,  2:21,  4 users,  load average: 0.25, 0.20, 0.12
Last reboot due to a blown fuse.  Everything from sound to udma works fine and
very fast on
my  k5-133. Ok, maybe not that impressive an uptime, but I thought it would be
nice to show
my appreciation for your collective fantastic work.
