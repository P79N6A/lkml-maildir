For i386 it was in the past the .config Linus used for his PC.
There is nu deeper thoughts behind the i386 defconfig.
Other architectures try to let their defconfig cover a lot
because defconfig are often used for test-compiling
stuff (I for once use them a lot).
Other again just chose a popular config and use it for their defconfig.
So no fixed ruleset - and very depending on your architecture.
