I do agree. It _sounds_ like a great idea to try to control the flow of 
patches better, but in the end, it needs to also be easy and painfree to 
the people involved, and also make sure that any added workflow doesn't 
require even *more* load and expertise on the already often overworked 
maintainers..
In many cases, I think it tends to *sound* great to try to avoid 
regressions in the first place - but it also sounds like one of those "I 
wish the world didn't work the way it did" kind of things. A worthy goal, 
but not necessarily one that is compatible with reality.
