So you want to learn a new programming language (C), a new operating
system (Linux) and dive into kernel development as well, all at the
same time - that's no small task :)
As for the C language bit, starting with K&R's "The C programming
language, second edition" is not a bad place to start.
http://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628/sr=8-1/qid=1171463251/ref=pd_ka_1/203-7856448-7676754?ie=UTF8&s=books
As for the linux kernel, "Linux Kernel Development, second edition"by
Robert Love is a good introduction that gives a good overview of most
aspects of the kernel.
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-Kernel-Development-Novell-Press/dp/0672327201/sr=1-1/qid=1171463315/ref=sr_1_1/203-7856448-7676754?ie=UTF8&s=books
You probably also want to read the file Documentation/HOWTO in the
Linux kernel source dir (as well as all the files it refers you to -
an online copy can be read here:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/HOWTO
And probably also won't hurt you to read "Linux in a Nutshell" by
Ellen Siever, Aaron Weber & Stephen Figgins if you want a good general
Linux reference.
