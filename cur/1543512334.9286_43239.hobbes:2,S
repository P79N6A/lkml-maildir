Just since it does not belond to fsdevel. devfs is more then filesystem...
And IMNSHO it's main problem with it. It's few things in one patch. I see at
least two:
  1) name-based (not major/minor based) way of registering devices
  2) way to expose such name-based devices in filesystem under /dev
     (or /devices, or /dev)
May be it should be splitted even more. Most peoples object against devfs per se
but NOT against more advanced scheme of device registering (quite a few devfs
antagonists like idea of central depositary where all drivers in kernel are
registered and you can see full list via some interface). On other hand most
fluidal and unstable part of devfs patch is exactly handling of such tree and
not devfs per se. It's possible to make different way to expose such
information (for example "old style" /dev plus devd to make it dynamic) and
compare them. Even if such information will be only available to special
"device installation" program without any dynamic /dev it'll be usefull thing.
THEN devfs will become MUCH less fluidal patch and deiscussion will really
belond only to fsdevel...
