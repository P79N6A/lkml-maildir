Any implementation of O_NONBLOCK on disk files any time in the forseeable future
(2.4? 2.5? 4.5?:( )... Irix has it, many commercial unices have it,
Windows NT has it (!), (does *BSD have it?), it would speed up khttpd on large
sites and would be very useful for any fileserver-type thing (e.g. a proxy I'm
working on which uses poll (soon siginfo?) for sockets and worker threads for
disk I/O... that is ugly and slows it down.
