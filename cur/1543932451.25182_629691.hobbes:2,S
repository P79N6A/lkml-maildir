hm. Those time warps were really small, due to the small imperfections 
in the "sync up all CPUs to the same moment and do a WRMSR to clear all 
their TSCs" mechanism. I.e. at most a few usec time warps. I really dont 
know how that should result in udevd hanging. Can you debug udevd in any 
way?
so the only thing that KVM might be doing incorrectly here is the 
emulation of the WRMSR that clears the TSC of each vcpu?
