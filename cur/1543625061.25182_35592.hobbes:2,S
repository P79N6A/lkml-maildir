Try the patch which gets rid of the BKL in ext2_get_block() --- if you
don't have that, let me know, I've got one kicking around that mostly
works except I haven't validated that it does the right thing if
quotas are enabled.  If you're running with a cold page cache, I
suspect that will help out much more.  If the numbers are assuming a
page-cache already preloaded with then getting rid of the BKL in
ext2_get_block() will help somewhat, but maybe not enough to be
significant.
