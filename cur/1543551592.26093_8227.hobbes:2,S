The "bs=4k" shouldn't be necessary at all. Because this
would imply that the correct behaviour of the encryption
is dependent on the blocksize in which the data is requested
by an outer read() call. If this is really the case something is broken.
(AFAIK the current behaviour is broken, because it exactly
 relies on this fact.)

This could be dangerous. I'm not sure that the kernel handles
this kind of concurrent access to the same encrypted blocks 
correctly. (I admit, that I think it should work but it still might
be dangerous...)

Well you said that my patch was a shot from the hip and complained
that I declared IV as "int" even if "request.sector" was declared
as "unsigned int" :-).

To build in a backward compatible way is OK, but I'm still 
concerned about bigger blocksizes than sectors:
The reason I wanted sectors is, that it seems that the smallest
chunk of data that can be requested from the outside is one sector,
which means 512 bytes. (I'm not sure if this is correct, but 
because ReiserFS works with the sector approach I guess it has
to be true.)
It should be no problem to implement smaller encryption chunk sizes.
On the other hand, if we use more than one sector, we might run 
into the problem that some utility which accesses the loop device 
on a more direct way ( - bypasses the FS - ) uses sectors as access 
unit and NOT blocks. 
In this case we would have to ensure
that the accesses are always aligned to the chosen blocksize and 
this makes things more complicated. (It is possible though...)

Does this mean sequence as in 0,1,2,3,4 ... or does this mean
any pre-calculate-able sequence ? In the former case we might just use
a simple one way hash-function over the requested sector number.
In the latter case, we might be able to use a message digest algorithm
which includes the sector number and part of the key.
(Both approaches slow the encryption further down, but for
 security concerned people this doesn't matter...)

Yes I found that out... I just imagined that I sent my first
message to vger.linux.org, don't ask me why :-).
so long
