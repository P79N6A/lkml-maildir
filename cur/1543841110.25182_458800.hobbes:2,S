Containers are not going to solve all the problems particularly the
scenarios like when a machine is a web server and an odd user can log on
to the same machine and (w/o any ulimits) claim all the memory that is
present in the system.
Though it is quite possible to implement a combination of two (task and
fs based) policies in containers and sysadmin can set a preference of
each each container.  [this probably is another reason for having a per
page container pointer].
