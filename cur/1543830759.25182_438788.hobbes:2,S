The problem you will find with any document of this kind is that the
kernel is constantly changing.  Who's going to keep the document up
to date?

free reads /proc/meminfo which your can see how this is done from
linux-2.6.17/fs/proc/proc_misc.c: meminfo_read_proc
vmstat gets its info from /proc/stat and you can see how that is done
from linux-2.6.17/fs/proc/proc_misc.c: show_stat

Yes and this is not process specific, but low level from any allocation.

What do you really want to know?  A process is abstract.  It's memory
can be physical, shared, a file or in swap. Its memory may not even be
allocated until it actually tries to use it.  So what exactly do you
need?
I'm bringing this up because too many managers want this information
and they don't know why.  Why do they want to know how much memory a
process is using?  Is it to see if it has a memory leak?  Is it just
to know how much it uses? If that is the case, then the virtual map
from /proc/PID/maps should be a good way to know.  It shows the shared
libraries, so you can take that into account.  And all the other memory
it maps has the potential to be real.  Otherwise, why would it map it?
Chances are, a process  wont use all the memory shown in maps, but
if you are afraid of running out of memory, then take the conservative
approach and give that answer.

I don't know anything about smap.
