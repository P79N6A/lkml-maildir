Where "it" is the app?
OK, well looking at the maps output, there seems to be three distinct
sections:
1) from 0x00000000 to 0x01c6a000 (30MB-ish) are mappings of the executable.
2) from 0xbca9a000 to 0xbfffffff (56MB-ish) are the libs, plus a few other
   areas, which I've assumed are stack, and scratch areas for the libs.
3) a single mapping, (was 1.1GB-ish in the map output I attached) which
   starts at the end of section 1, and is continually growing, and which I
   can see has no reason to stop until it gets to the start of section 2
   (some 3GB - 86MB later).
Now admittedly, it's possible that some of the other mappings may grow by a
factor of 20 to suddenly eat up 1GB of address space, but I doubt it. So I'm
not buying the address space idea at the moment. That said, I'm not going to
discount it and will keep a log of what happens on the mappings while this
process is running, just in case something really wacky like that happens.
