I see you think you have the solution, but I guess I am just dense here.  May be 
you could help me to see the error of my ways.  Here is my thinking:
"now" is from gettimeofday() and as such is ntp corrected.
"uptime" is also corrected.  In fact it is "now" + "wall_to_monotonic".  And 
"wall_to_monotonic" is _only_ changed by do_settime() when the clock is set.
"time_from_boot_to_process_start" is the same as "start_time" restated in 
seconds, i.e. it is a constant.  So, either one or more of the above assumtions 
is wrong, or  somebody is twiddling the clock.  Otherwise I don't see how the 
start time can move at all.
