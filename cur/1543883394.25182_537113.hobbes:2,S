Ok, may be DOS was not the correct term, but with the 2.6.21 hrt there 
is a great difference between an infinite loop and the high-rate 
context-switching task (you can try attached programs).
With the first I the system is still responsive, with the latter it 
isn't (new process take lot's of time to get created, other process are 
very slow).
If it is "just 'CPU time used up'", why I see a such difference between 
the 2 cases ?
Maybe the current scheduler failed to handle correctly this case ?
