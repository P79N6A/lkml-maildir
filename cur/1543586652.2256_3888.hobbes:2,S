- If you apply such a patch first, and after that you edit EXTRAVERSION,
your value will be used - no problem.
- If you edit EXTRAVERSION before applying such a patch, the specific hunk
trying to change the EXTRAVERSION will be rejected - again no problem.
Actually this is already the case when you apply 2 patches trying to set
EXTRAVERSION to 2 different values...
