Of course ksymoops can cope with modules.  But you have to feed it the
same /proc/ksyms and /proc/modules contents that existed at the time of
the error.  From the ksymoops man page :-
       -k ksyms
              Where  to  find  the  list of kernel symbols at the
              time of  the  failure.   Unfortunately  the  kernel
              symbol  list  in  /proc/ksyms  is  volatile,  it is
              updated as modules are loaded and removed.  Try  to
              copy  /proc/ksyms  to  a  normal  file  as  soon as
              possible after the Oops and point ksymoops at  that
              copy using -k.  If you had to reboot after the Oops
              and you do not have a copy of  /proc/ksyms  at  the
              time of the Oops, try to reload the same modules in
              the same order before  running  ksymoops.
Also see the modutils-2.2-pre6 patch in the ksymoops home directory
(
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops
).  That patch lets you automatically
capture ksyms and modules whenever a module is loaded or deleted.
