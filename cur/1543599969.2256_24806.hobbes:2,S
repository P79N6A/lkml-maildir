These are bounce buffer allocations - they do fail, but the failures
should be temporary and the machine should make progress. 
There are some nasty issues with HIGHMEM that will be seriously improved
during 2.5.x when we start doing IO directly from highmem for
controllers that can handle it, but that 2.4.x is not likely to really
fix.  So you should expect to see messages like the above that are about
"we couldn't allocate memory for bounce buffers", and they _will_ imply
that performance isn't going to be as good as it possibly should be, but
at the same time it shouldn't be a real problem either.
Does the machine stay up and perform reasonably well?
(Where "reasonable" doesn't necessarily mean "really well", but means
"it's not absolutely horrible").
