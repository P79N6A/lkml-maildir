It is handleable.
You wrote the code to parse:
Bla blub bli 
1   2    3
the new kernel has
Bla blub blo bli
1   2    5   3
So in perl code (for compactness, C is only a bit wordier, untested, I'm
sure a perl guru could write it in less lines):
%known_titles = ("Bla" => -1,  "blub" => -1,  "bli" => -1); 
# match known titles to column numbers.
$titleline = <PROCFH>;
@fields = split(/\s+/,$titleline);
$column = 0; 
foreach (@fields) { 
	if ($known_titles{$_}) { 
		$known_titles{$_} = $column;
	}
	$column++;
}
# handling for missing columns is easy to add here.
#now read /proc file
while(<PROCFH>) { 
	@fields = split(/\s+/);
	$bla = $fields[$known_titles{"Bla"}];
	$bli = $fields[$known_titles{"bli"}];
	$blub = $fields[$known_titles{"blub"}];
	# process them..
}

That is simply a bug and should never happen.

New rows are easy. You have to deal with them all the times.
