Subject: [PATCH] sched: make task_nice available to non-GPL modules
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/5/392

The API is trivial, and so is the implementation.  Linux priorities are
exposed to the userspace, so nobody should claim that software aware of
Linux priorities is a derived work of the kernel.
The complementary function set_user_nice() is available to non-GPL
modules.  If the module can set the priority, it should be able to read
it back.
