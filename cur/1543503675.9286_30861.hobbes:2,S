Hi !
You could physically share the same SCSI disks array :
2 hosts connected to the same disk array, only one mounts the FS R/W, the
other one mounts them R/O (or does not mount them), and when a problem is
detected, the backup mounts the FS R/W (in case of some crashes, you'll
have to do FSCK before that), and does the IPAT.
Anyway, this only prevents from software or host hardware crash, but not
from file corruption nor disk problem in general.
