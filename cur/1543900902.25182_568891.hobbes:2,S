I've lost the original question from this thread, but the idea of the longish
timeouts was that drive *may* be spun down ("standby"), and thus have to spin
up again to complete media commands.  Back then, drives were much slower at
spinning up than nowadays, and the ATA spec says to allow up to 30 seconds.
