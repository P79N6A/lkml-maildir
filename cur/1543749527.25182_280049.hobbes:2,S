Hello,
I have a Toshiba Satelite M30X laptop for which suspend-to-disk is 
reported to work. I tested with kernel 2.6.9 vanilla and -ac16 and 
suspending seemed to work ok, at least the computer shut down. On 
resuming I appended "resume=/dev/hda3" (my swap partition) to the boot 
options but saw no message about resuming form suspend image ot 
anything, it seems to be a normal boot. Later on when adding swap I got 
the error "Unable to find swap-space signature", `cat /proc/swaps` 
didn't show anything. I had to recreate the swap.
Could anyone please look into this? I would provide any additional 
information requested. Please Cc: me when you answer. Thanks in advance.
