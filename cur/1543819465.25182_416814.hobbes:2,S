This to me looks like you have a corrupted fs after using the 4k sectors
as the max transfer setting. I would look for a bug in the driver that
could explain this. Or perhaps the hardware.
Can you try and boot with MAX_XFER_SECTORS at 4096 and run mkfs + copy
big file to the partition. umount, then boot a kernel with
MAX_XFER_SECTORS at 512 and do a full fsck of that partition.
