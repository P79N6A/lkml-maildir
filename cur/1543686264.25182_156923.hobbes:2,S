The main reason i have a preference for a seperate MSI handling path is so 
that we don't have to do the platform_irq thing in do_IRQ and we know 
what to expect wrt irq or vector. If platform_irq stays we should at 
least try and pick up on what the IA64 folks have done, But that would be 
even harder to get done right now.
