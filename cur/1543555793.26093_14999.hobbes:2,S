Sorry, John, I _have_ to [give good example to others]. The above says
that _you_ my dear friend, do not know where the BSS clearing code is. It
is not in setup.S. It is not even in the same directory, where setup.S is.
It is in arch/i386/kernel/head.S, starting from line 120:
/*
 * Clear BSS first so that there are no surprises...
 */
        xorl %eax,%eax
        movl $ SYMBOL_NAME(__bss_start),%edi
        movl $ SYMBOL_NAME(_end),%ecx
        subl %edi,%ecx
        cld
        rep
        stosb
... speaking of which (putting asbesto on and hiding from Andries ;) can't
we optimize this code to move words at a time and not bytes.... ;)
Regards,
Tigran
