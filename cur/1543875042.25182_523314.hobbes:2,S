I think you're fixing the symptom here and not the cause.  If calculating
the virtual address of a page is so expensive on your setup it should
define WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL and we should always cache the virtual address
in struct page.  There's a lot more code, epecially in filesystems that's
rather upset about a slow page_address.
