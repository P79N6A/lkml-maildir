*Any* time that you write to an executing executable, all bets are off.  The 
most likely outcome is a big 'ol crash & burn.  With a local FS, Unix 
prevents you from shooting yourself in the foot, but with NFS, fire away..  
I've done it.  It *does* let you, but...
Solution:  Don't do that.  Shut them all down, on all clients, upgrade the 
binaries, then restart the processes on the clients.
As far as the scenerio that you've described, I *think* that it would 
actually work.  When the new process is fork()ed, it gets a copy of the file 
descriptors from it's parent, so the file is still open to it.  If it the 
exec()s, the new image no longer has any real ties to it's parent (at least, 
not that are relevant to this).
If it's created via clone(), then, once again, it's got it's parents 
descriptors still open, so no problem.
I think the real problems only exist over NFS and NFS-like scenerios.
Did I miss something here, or am I actually correct?  I was correct once, 
let's see...  Ooops.  That was a mistake too.
