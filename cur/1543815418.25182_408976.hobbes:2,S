[ offtopic note: gnome-terminal developers claim some massive speedups

  corraborate that - gnome-term is now faster (for me) than xterm. ]

yeah. The "|cat" changes the workload, which gets rated by the scheduler 
differently. Such artifacts are inevitable once interactivity heuristics 
are strong enough to significantly distort the equal sharing of CPU 
time.
