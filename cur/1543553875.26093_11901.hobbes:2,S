The kernel isn't going non-ELF.  Too painful, for dubious advantages,
namely:
The current gcc toolchain already supports what you suggest.
I understand that some people have even put some thought into a
bootloader that dynamically links your kernel on bootup, so this idea
isn't new.  It's a good idea though.
