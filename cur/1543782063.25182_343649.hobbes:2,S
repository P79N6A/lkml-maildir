Hi!
> Only compile kernel/power if sleep support is going to be used.
I'm sorry, this patch is wrong. It broke compilation on ARM. I could
fix it, but then I found out that it is probably not worth the
effort. Only refrigerator stuff can be compiled-out on ARM, and that's
single file. Probably best to revert...
