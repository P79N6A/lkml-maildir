There is probably not much choice. If you want to stay with the loff_t
arguments it won't work on 31-bit s390 or 32-bit powerpc dependent on the
order of the arguments.
So you should go for what Matthew Wilcox suggested:
asmlinkage long sys_fallocate(int fd, int mode, u32 off_low, u32 off_high,
			      u32 len_low, u32 len_high);
That way it will work an all architectures and in addition no architecture
has to do some magic to combine the splitted 64 bit arguments in compat
mode.
