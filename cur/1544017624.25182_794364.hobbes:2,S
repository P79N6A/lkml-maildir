this is different from the NMI watchdog in a number of ways:
 - it works on all platforms and in all situations where the NMI watchdog 
   does not work.
 - in theory it can detect hard lockups in situations where the NMI 
   watchdog is disabled, such as suspend/resume or early bootup. 
   (especially early bootup lockups are nasty and the NMI watchdog is 
    enabled relatively late)
 - it could be extended to detect 'soft' lockups too - i.e. we could have 
   a one-stop facility to detect all kinds of "kernel does not seem to 
   progress" lockups.
But it's not as complete as the NMI watchdog: it relies on instrumented 
function calls rolling on and on during the lockup - that's not the case 
when we get a hard lockup due to a tight, infinite loop somewhere.
