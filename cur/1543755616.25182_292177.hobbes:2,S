There's nothing wrong with using setuid root if you do it carefully and 
properly.  If you have the sources to the program then you can place all 
the necessary safeguards in the program itself.  Doing this inside the 
program would allow more elaborate control over who is allowed to set RT 
policy from within the program.  E.g. you could have a file (owned by 
root and only writable by root) in /etc with the names of the users that 
have this privilege.  If this file does not exist, has the wrong 
privileges or the user associated with task's ruid is not in the file 
then the the program immediately and irrevocably drops root privileges 
otherwise it drops them temporarily and regains them when it needs to 
either change policy to RT or fork another task that needs the same 
privileges.

I believe that there are mechanisms that allow this.  The setuid man 
page states that a process with non root real uid but setuid as root can 
use the seteuid call to use the _POSIX_SAVED_IDS mechanism to drop and 
regain root privileges as required.
