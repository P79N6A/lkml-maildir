The "bug" is not specific to GNU make 3.80 but can also be seen in
3.78.1 for instance.
The "bug" however is purely cosmetical.
GNU make writes a message that an "include" file is missing, but it
finds it has a rule, generates the include file, pulls it in and
continues as though the file had always been there.
For instance if you have this Makefile:
# BEGIN Makefile
all:    hello
hello.d:
        makedepend -f- hello.c >$@
include hello.d
# END Makefile
You'll get at "make" time:
Makefile:5: hello.d: No such file or directory
makedepend -f- hello.c >hello.d
cc   hello.o   -o hello
and a working hello program.
Jörg's complaints about GNU make aren't false but aren't helpful either
and certainly don't warrant waiting 15 seconds after that message.
There is no bug, just this confusing "Makefile:5: hello.d: No such file
or directory".

No, it isn't.
