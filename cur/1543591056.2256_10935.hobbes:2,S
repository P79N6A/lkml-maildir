One more - chr_dev_init() becomes initcall. However, I'd really like
to see this one reviewed from the ordering POV. It may break things -
we might need to move some stuff around. FWIW it works for me, but I don't
have a lot of hardware, so that doesn't say much.
Folks, please look into that - previous patches allow to turn device
initialization into initcalls and it's a Good Thing(tm). Just look
at device_init(), chr_dev_init() and blk_dev_init() - each of them is
a hive of ifdefs.
Linus, your comments?
