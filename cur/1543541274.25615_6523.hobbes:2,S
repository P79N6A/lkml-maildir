Hey everybody,
I have the following problem with my Linux-2.2.15 Kernel:
Originally on the 2.2.10 Kernel was installed on my System. Then I
wanted to update my System to the 2.2.15 and patched the kernel
(2.2.10->2.2.11->2.2.12->2.2.13->2.2.14->2.2.15). After that I
configured and compiled the new kernel. Now at the system start and
sometimes during my work, the log console prints the following message:
modprobe: can't find module char-major-4
or
modprobe: can't find module cahr-major-5.
What's this??? Maybe somebody can help me
Thanx. Jan
