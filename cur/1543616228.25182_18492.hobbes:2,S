And, of course, the etymology of the word "knots" refers to the fact
that before modern spedometers and GPS tools, ships would gauge
their speed by letting a rope freely drag out of the stern of the ship
and would measure the number of equally spaced "knots" in the rope
that had rolled off the ship during the period of one hour.
