The nopage method. In Alessandro Rubini's book (p.391) I read, that I can't use remap_page_range() on pages optained by get_free_page().

exactly that happens in the version I use on minor 26 today.

Hmm, the only thing that happens to them after munmap() is 
free_pages(). I don't access the pages anymore. But maybe some code in free_pages does? Or decrements count to -1?

Yes, I do that in the version used in minor 27 today right after the allocation.

by get_page(), right?

Ok, thanks a lot. So it's definitely insufficient how my minor 26 version handles the pages, right? If so, that's a statement I can live with.
And it was never ment that I could simply mmap the upper pages to userspace directly, without 'touching' each page, was it?
