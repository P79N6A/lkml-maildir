Nice idea to make this generic.
If you push this it would be also good to consider some variant
of the "crasher" code that is in SUSE Kernels to include with it. 
It was originally written by Chris Mason and it also makes it easier
to stabilize such bugs. The basic idea is that a background thread
allocates lots of slabs and pages always poisons them and checks them
in the background. If someone corrupts memory that is noticed earlier
then
Basically it extends what your patchkit is doing to free memory too.
Chris' old patch:

(various variants of that have existed over time)
