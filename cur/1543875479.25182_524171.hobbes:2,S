I wonder it was the combination of the base addr randomization patch and 
something specific to the openSuSE loader that was sparking the 
failures?  I ran about 22 million execs on Ubuntu Feisty (patched to 
re-include the base addr randomization), with a PIE bash, and never saw 
it.  Hmpf.

Is there any explicitly documented per-arch "here is the memory layout 
of a process"?  I haven't been able to find anything like this.  I 
suspect it would be a good reference to have; so if no one has any 
hints, I'll try to get something written up.
