So you can open/explore the CD in Windows?
The call stack could have scrolled off of the top of the screen.
If not, then cdrom_start_read() called cdrom_start_packet_command(),
but there's not enough info to see what went haywire in
cdrom_start_packet_command() or whether that latter function
called cdrom_start_read_continuation() which then erred or if
it called something which fumbled.  So if you can get more/better
info (from kernel log or serial console etc.), that would be very
helpful.
