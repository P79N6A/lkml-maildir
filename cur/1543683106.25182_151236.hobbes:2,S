I almost thought that would be it. I do understand that that code needs to be 
really clean, but, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't GCC's long long 
implementation efficient enough to only add minimal overhead to that? On 
IA32, it shouldn't take more than one or two more instructions (per counter), 
and it seems to me that net_device_stats should still be small enough to 
avoid any more cache misses.
I'm no expert, of course, so if I'm wrong, please tell me.

Currently, I'm sampling once a day, and although sampling more often could, of 
course, solve the problem, it's just that I don't think that it should be 
necessary.
Do the iptables counters take the whole packet into account, or do they ignore 
the ethernet header?

While that is true in theory, I'm just using it to estimate my home net usage, 
and my router hasn't crashed this far, so I'm not very worried about that.
Thank you very much for your input. For now, I'm just going to implement 64 
bit counters in my kernel.
