Oh and please reject the idea of compressing the pages
you are writing to disk for the following reaons:
1. compression is not deterministic in terms of the possible space
savings, you will still have to provide the required amount of space.
2. every compression algorithm has theoretical cases where the
compression mechanism is actually increasing the space requirements.
3. Compressing around 360 Mbytes of data will take quite a lot
of time.
4. Point 3 will make the CPU go high - not nice if the suspend
happens in case of battery emergency...
Anyway it's time to repartition my notebook :-).
