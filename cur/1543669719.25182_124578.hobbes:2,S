Another scenario would be if a hotpluggable disk interface failed.
Someone could purposely move the cable to a second adaptor, before
replacing the failed one.  Relevant userspace apps could be suspended
during this switch over, but when they are resumed, it would be
desirable to have the disks with the same minor numbers as before,
thereby simplifying the userspace application's requirements.

It's also arguably better done in userspace.  The kernel would see the
device disappear and re-appear, but a userspace abstraction layer
could identify it as being the same device, (and unmodified since it
last saw it), and act accordingly.
Effectively, reads from an unconnected device would succeed if the
data was cached, and writes would succeed at least until a certain
amount of write cache had been filled.  The result of disconnecting a
device, modifying it's contents, then re-connecting it would be
undefined.
