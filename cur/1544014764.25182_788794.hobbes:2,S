What was the fate of Ingo's previous patch[*1] to implement this (which,
incidentally, also included updates to documentation and made the interval
configurable as Éric Piel suggests) ?
[*1]:

Just a minor nit, but the patch description (not included in the patch itself)
"at least once a day" isn't particularly accurate given that the patch enforces
at least a day [minus a second or so] has elapsed since the last update.  The
description in the above-referenced patch "only once a day" better captures the
situation, I think.
pjrm.
