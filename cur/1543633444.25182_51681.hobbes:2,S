   The DMA_ALIGN attribute doesn't work, on some systems the PCI
   cacheline size is determined at boot time not compile time.
Another note, it could be per-PCI controller what this cacheline size
is.  We'll need to pass in a pdev to the alignment interfaces to
do this correctly.
So none of this can be done at compile time folks.
