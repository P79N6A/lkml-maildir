Ok, then it's something else, maybe the TSO changes...
Here's some thigs to try:
You can see the current settings, TSO etc, with
'ethtool -k eth0'
and disable TSO with
'ethtool -K eth0 tso off'
If that doesn't help there's more things to try.
I don't know anything about the diffrent TCP congestion algorithms
(Stephen does), but you could try disabling BIC.
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_bic
(continuing with things I hardly know anything about...)
Or maybe the autotuning receive buffer, try disabling that with
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_moderate_rcvbuf
Stephen, any more things to try ?
