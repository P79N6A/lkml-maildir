I don't think so, simply because this has happened to me on two
compeletely different Linux systems.  One (griffon) has a 3c59x
card, and the other (dwarf) had a tulip and an ne2k-pci.
(Or did you mean on the server side?  The OpenBSD box is using two
RTL 8139 cards.)

I haven't tried that yet, but after discussing this with another
person who was having the same problems, we learned that OpenBSD's
firewall (pf) was blocking the Linux packets when configured with
"scrub in all" (which is recommended in the OpenBSD FAQs).
After commenting out the "scrub in all" and rebooting back to 2.4.20,
I have X and NFS working simultaneously.
