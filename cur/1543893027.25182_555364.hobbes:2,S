That paper seems entirely focused on the automatic generation of policy,
and doesn't seem to help the discussion along.   For instance, there may
be a way to implement AA on top of SELinux _without_ giving each and
every file its own label.

AA must have a function that decides the security rights for any given
path in order to make its enforcement decisions.  It must surely be able
to deal with all those things you listed above (bind-mounts,hard links etc).
So why can't those decisions be turned into labels that are fed into SELinux
enforcement code?
