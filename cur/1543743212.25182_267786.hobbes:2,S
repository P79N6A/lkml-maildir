Subject: [PATCH] UML: Use PTRACE_KILL instead of SIGKILL to kill host-OS processes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/3/66

kill(..., SIGKILL) doesn't work to kill host-OS processes created in
the exec path in TT mode --- for this we need PTRACE_KILL (it did work
in previous kernels, but not by design).  Without this process will
accumulate on the host-OS (although the won't be visible inside UML).
Signed-off-by: Chris Wedgwood <cw@f00f.org>

Yes, there are other fixes along these lines which are needed but one
at a time as we test these...
