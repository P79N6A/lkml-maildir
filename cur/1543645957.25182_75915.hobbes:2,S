OK, that is easy to do...

Yes. I need to spend some time on this one. Just lots
of little differences...

OK, I have a new patch today that cleans all this up.
I made all the existing ksysms symbols present. It turns out
many where already there in my more recent patches anyway.
A couple needed to be stubbed. The next patch has no diffs
to ksyms at all.

I was looking over this yesterday too. Should be able to clean this
up a bit.
What do you think about the separate mm/mmnommu directories
at the top level?  Should the mmnommu be merged into mm?
Do you want me to CC you when I put new patches up?
Thanks
Greg
