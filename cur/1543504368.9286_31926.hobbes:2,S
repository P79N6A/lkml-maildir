If you want complete and final isolation for the non boot CPU´s,
how about modifying:
      #define PIC_IRQS       
((1<<2)|(1<<13))                                                                                                      
in arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c.
Each set bit disables IOAPIC processing for that particular interrupt!
