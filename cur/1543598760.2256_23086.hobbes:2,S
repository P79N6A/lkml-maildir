You have to keep track of the significant bits in the dma_addr_t
regardless of its size, so you put it into your TX descriptor's (or
what have you) native format that doesn't waste any space.  You don't
need to keep the full dma_addr_t around.  Perhaps this is just sloppy
programming?

If you don't want to take part in technical discussions, you should
work in closed source. 8-)
