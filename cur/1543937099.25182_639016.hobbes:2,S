Hm, don't know either. It never blew for my tests (and I did extensive
moving around of ccw devices...)

Yes. But we jump out early if old_parent == new_parent.

Yes, I think so.

I just wonder why I never hit it since I regularily do some testing of
the moving stuff (on Greg's tree and on mainline). But bluetooth has
been using this interface for some time as well (and they were the ones
with the problems triggering this patch).

Me too. But maybe I'm just too familiar with the code...
