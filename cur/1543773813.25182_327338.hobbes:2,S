The list is not wrong. I was just noting that it was too short, missing
three items of particular interest for server filesystems (which seems
to be the target environment). Support for:
	Directory change notification (F_NOTIFY)
	Distributed Caching (F_SETLEASE/F_GETLEASE/break_lease)
	POSIX ACLs
The lack of support for lsattr/chattr (chflags) is less important, and
the lack of support for the multipage operations (writepages and
readpages) is not a compatability issue and is not critical, although it
might hurt performance.
I did see that you have aio - and that was interesting because there are
so few implementations and that as well as vectorio was something I
wanted to explore for the cifs vfs client.
