I'd agree with Linus here. A signal handler is part of the application, so 
it should be single stepped in the same way other application code does. 
My original patch simply reenabled the flag before returning to userspace, 
and this had the consequence to single step into signal handlers too.
PS: I still cannot find the beginning this thread on lkml.
