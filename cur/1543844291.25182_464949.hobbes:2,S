I've applied this, and fixed up the build issue (needed to add it also
to the drivers/usb/Makefile file) and the sparse errors, but I'm still
getting these warnings:
drivers/usb/host/ohci.h:605: warning: 'periodic_reinit' defined but not used
drivers/usb/host/ohci.h:629: warning: 'roothub_a' defined but not used
drivers/usb/host/ohci.h:635: warning: 'roothub_portstatus' defined but not used
Care to send me a follow-on patch that fixes this?
thanks,
greg k-h
