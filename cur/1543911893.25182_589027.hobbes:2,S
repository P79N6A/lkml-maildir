Yes, what you do here is more precisely:
  preempt_disable()
  local_irq_save()
  preempt_enable_no_resched()
  ...
  local_irq_restore()
  preempt_check_resched()

If kernel is non preemptible, the macros preempt_*() are defined to
nothing. And as you say, on preemptible kernels, these variables (thread
flags and preempt count) are very likely to be in cache, since they are
in the thread info struct, but it should still be kept in mind.
