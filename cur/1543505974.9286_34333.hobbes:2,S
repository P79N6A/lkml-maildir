That's the Sun client asking about RPC program number 100227.  According
to Solaris' /etc/rpc, it's:
nfs_acl         100227
I find no mention of this in IRIX or Linux, so I assume it's a
Sun-proprietary sideband protocol to transmit access control lists.  I
don't think you have anything to worry about.
