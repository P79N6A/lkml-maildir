Wrong.
Think about "memcpy()" and structures (imagine a structure that mixes
16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit data).
There is no easy solution to bi-endianness. Anybody who thinks there is is
just sadly misguided. You should aim for having a systemwide endianness,
anything else is just asking for trouble for absolutely no real gain.
"Just say no". LE is here to stay, just live with it.
