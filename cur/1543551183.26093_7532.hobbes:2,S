Turned that on, applied the patch. BTW, your patch seems to make the
"Speed warnings" failure _more_ likely??
Still refuses to activate UDMA3. 11.5Mb/sec vs. 17Mb/sec in 2.2. Is my
hardware trying to tell me that 2.2 shouldn't be allowing me to run with
UDMA3? It's rock solid and yes I've given it a pounding.
Cheers
