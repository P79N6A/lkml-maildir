Both

Calling nfsd_setuser an extra time does open us up for a very tiny
possibility of an ENOMEM at an awkward time.
We could remove that entirely for NFSEXP_ALLSQUASH by allocating an
empty group_info at export time and just using a reference to that.
It would be more awkward to pre-allocate for the NFSEXP_ROOTSQUASH
case as the group_info has to be at least as big as the one in the RPC
request, and would could need a different one of each concurrent
request.... not sure if that is worth "fixing".
Thanks,
NeilBrown
