I just stumbled across "the Month of Kernel Bugs (MoKB) archive" -
http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/
It's a page that will release 1 kernel bug each day for all of this
month. There are some Linux kernel bugs listed as well as bugs for
other OS kernels.
Just wanted to bring it to the attention of a wider audience in case
he lists some new/unknown bugs that we ought to fix.
