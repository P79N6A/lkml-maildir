"could", yes.  "should", no.  I'll refer you to my HURD comment.
That's not to say that none of this should be userspace, just that some 
of it most certainly *never* needs to touch userspace, such as 
cryptocompress.
I'm not guessing that you wanted to make it FUSE, I just want to be 
pre-emptive here.  FUSE will NOT work well for this.

Metafs also avoids having to patch tar.  It's assumed that legacy backup 
systems can always avoid metafs and still catch almost everything 
important, and certainly everything they already do catch.  With a 
hybrid or an entirely new backup system, we could catch everything, 
including any new ACL-like animals that people invent.
