I just wrote a message about why it is not microkernel, and were is the
difference. And walking in the direction "while it is possible, it is
hard" will take us nowhere. Imagine Linux Torwalds thinking this way
before starting to write Linux...

It will. As pointed out above, it will save me the need to roll on an
excess personality and possibly more programs. This will simplify the
system, will decrease the resources needed , and will increase the
productivity.

I agree that Windows could do better, for all resources drained into it.
However, the amout of Windows software that will have to be ported to
Linux, as a work, will be magnitudes over the work needed to implement not
only a full layering model, with a complete support for all Windows
versions that exist and will ever exist, but also a good dozen other
platforms.
And while porting applications may be problem of their vendors, making
Linux kernel better is our problem. I believe that this is what the
discussion is about.

I don't see the need for starting a project.
First, if unsuccssful, no reason to start it. And if successful, it will
fork the kernel development, with all negative implications following.
I see no sense in doing what eventually will damage the kernel
development, instead of improving it.
Second, the development of the kernel is already going this way,
regardless of our discussion. This is its logic. You can see no use of the
discussion, but you cannot see no use in following the kernel development
logic.
What I offer is merely to see where the road that we tread now goes, and
can't we avoid some of the sideswings and the muddy parts.
