Yes, this is correct.

True. But these functions are supposed to perform all the necessary checks 
and return ERR_PTR if anything fails, so everything is fine and nothing 
gets broken.

I agree that this is better solution. Andrew, this Jakub's patch should 
replace the pie-randomization-fix-bad_addr-macro.patch if possible. You 
can add 
Signed-off-by: Jiri Kosina <jkosina@suse.cz>
if that makes any difference.
