I'm not even certain it was ever offered (it's not in Config.in), but
I'm curious if CONFIG_SB_ACER is a useful option: I have started
converting an Acer 330T laptop to 2.2.10 and in addition to running
into the APM oops during the apm initialization, I also find the sound
modules install without trouble but fail to create any audio, mixer or
midi devices.  With the sound modules in the kernel, I also get a
string of hundreds of "neighbour table overflow" messages.
