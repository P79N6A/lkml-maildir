What we do with our 2.4 version of the driver is something on this
lines. When the media is removed we invalidate the buffers and then
set the card absent bit. Now on when read/write requests arrive we
return error status to the file system since card is absent. This worked
for 2.4.x.
Is there some existing driver which addresses removable media on 2.6.x
Kernel? I would like to see how it addresses this.. then I will have
a better idea to address it with the kernel support we have now.
