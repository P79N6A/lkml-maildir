2Tb should still work. And to get to the 16 TB limit you'd have to
recompile with PAE. It costs some (rather limited) RAM overhead and some
fork() overhead. I think ext2/ext3fs's current 2Tb/4Tb limit is a much
bigger problem, you cannot compile around that - are there any patches in
fact that lift that limit? (well, one solution is to use another
filesystem.)
