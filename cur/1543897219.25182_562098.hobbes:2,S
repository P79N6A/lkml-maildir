if that happens the device could also change pci ID... I don't think we can 
guard against that kind of abuse anyway. While this is perfectly possible (e.g. 
network cards carrying this info in their eeproms), we should still be OK with 
the core patch, but the device driver itself needs to pull the information 
manually from the device using the pci_get_config_byte() method.
