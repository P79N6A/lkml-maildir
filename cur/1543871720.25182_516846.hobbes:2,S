Did you confirm that that was indeed the cause of the problem you saw?
As far as I can tell, the bug (because it tested the wrong #define) would 
only affect the constant-size case, and only for something larger than a 
single page, and only for a non-power-of-two size. So it looked fairly 
hard to trigger, if only because all the obvious constants I saw seemed 
to already be powers-of-two..
So did you hunt it down to a particular cases where it triggers?
