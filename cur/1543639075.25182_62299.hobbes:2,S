Hello,
Little question: what is the correct path to compiling a kernel?
In the FAQ you find often: 
make dep clean bzImage modules moduleS_install
Now, I, myself, have found that often (especially with -ac kernels) this 
results in some file not being found...
Using
make clean dep .... 
solves the problem.
What is the correct way?
Thanks!
DK
