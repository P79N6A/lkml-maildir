Hi,
This patch series is a major rework of the ide-cd driver.
The motivations behind it are twofold:
* ide-cd is still in use but because it has been out of luck for maintainers
  lately the code become quite hard to debug and maintain - this puts it back
  into the shape
* aid efforts of developers (Tejun and Alan) who are working on libata ATAPI
  support - it should be now a lot easier to spot the various quirks for
  weird/buggy devices, differences between sr/ide-cd etc.
This patch series contains only safe/straightforward changes (some "risky"
ones are scheduled for later time) and should be fully bisectable.
Changes:
* unify _four_ slightly different IRQ handlers into one
* re-organize handling of quirky-devices (group quirks scattered
  all over the driver in the table and handle them using flags)
* move code for verbose error logging to ide-cd_verbose.c (this
  code doesn't have any IDE subsystem dependencies so if desired
  it can be easily converted into generic IDE/libata library)
* move code handling cdrom.c IOCTLs to ide-cd_ioctl.c
* remove duplicated/dead code (> 700 LOC gone)
* move historical changelog to Documentation/ide/
* fix few bugs discovered during rewrite
