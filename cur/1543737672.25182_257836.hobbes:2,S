For the do_mounts.c code, I see how the call to sys_open() could be
replaced with a call to filp_open().  However, vfs_read() still takes
a __user pointer for its buffer argument -- in fact, even the
filesystem .aio_read method takes a __user pointer.  So I'm not sure
how this code should be fixed.
Thanks,
