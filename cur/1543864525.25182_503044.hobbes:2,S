Any AP with a hidden SSID will only respond to probe requests that specify its SSID, and will ignore
any other probes. In addition, the response will have an empty SSID field. These responses are the
only ones in which a substitution would occur. These are the same responses where the current code
sends back the "<hidden>" pseudo-SSID. My change would put the correct one there.

We aren't guessing. The response frame with the empty SSID field must have come from the AP with the
SSID we want. Filling in the expected value is just making it easier for the user-space tools.
