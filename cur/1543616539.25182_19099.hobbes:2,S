What kind of signal run time do you normally have in digital sound processing
equipment? AFAIK one can expect a feew frames with of delay (n x 13ms).
Just dont feed back the processed signal to the singers monitor box.

You do not start up netscape while you do realtime av processing in
professional environemnt.
Well, an easy fix is to have the LL patch and do not use swap. Then you only
need reliable/predictable hardware (which is not so easy to get for PC).
