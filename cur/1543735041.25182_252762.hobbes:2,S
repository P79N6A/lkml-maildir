Not if I don't build my fs as a module?  And yeah, in the strictest sense
it IS a leak if a user can do that.
Now, I'm not *really* concerned withs ecurity, I just want to make sure we
don't flippantly disregard it.
I'd be happy if the actual block device was not part of the event.
What worries me more is that only some mount/umount calls get events, and
not all of them.
