If I do this I get a lockup or an instant reboot. 
But it looks like something is wrong. I'm not getting traces at all and
the preempt_max_latency remains stubbornly at 0. 
I'll try with the previous kernel but I'll just turn on tracing for all
activity, not just within the jackd client activation cycle. It looks
like the xruns are happening elsewhere.

PS: this is what I'm using to "arm" the trace (from the trace-it.c
example):
