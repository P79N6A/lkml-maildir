Hi, it's me again.  Sorry to be back, but 2.6 is looming and I still have the
same old problem with my Asus A7V8X with builtin Broadcom chip.
If you'll recall I must do an ifconfig down/up cycle to get the chip to transmit
any packets.  Once I do that the chip works fine until the next reboot.  See lkml
archives for March 5.
This problem first appeared in 2.4.21-rc5.  Before that the chip worked fine for me.
All I can offer is below.  I'll be happy to do any debugging you wish, but I will
need explicit help.  I'm no expert at kernel debugging.
00:09.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5702 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 02)
         Subsystem: Asustek Computer, Inc.: Unknown device 80a9
         Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 10
         Memory at f1800000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]
         Expansion ROM at f7ff0000 [disabled] [size=64K]
         Capabilities: [40] PCI-X non-bridge device.
         Capabilities: [48] Power Management version 2
         Capabilities: [50] Vital Product Data
         Capabilities: [58] Message Signalled Interrupts: 64bit+ Queue=0/3 Enable-
eth0: Tigon3 [partno(BCM95702A20) rev 1002 PHY(5703)] (PCI:33MHz:32-bit) 10/100/1000BaseT Ethernet 00:e0:18:d2:a6:c1
If there is some way of dumping the 'state' of the chip before and after doing the
ifconfig down/up it might be a valuable clue.  I just don't know how to do it.
