that was epoll not kevent, but yeah. To me the biggest question is, how 
much improvement does kevent bring relative to epoll? Epoll is a pretty 
good event queueing API, and it covers all the event sources today. It 
is also O(1) throughout, so i dont really understand how it could only 
achieve half the speed of kevent in the evserver_epoll/kevent.c 
benchmark. We need to understand that first.
