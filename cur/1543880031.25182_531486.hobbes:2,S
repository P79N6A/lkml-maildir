Hi Pierre/philip,
This is regarding the MMCv4 support that came in as part of the MMC
core of 2.6.20 linux kernel version.
The high speed MMC cards can support 4-bit/8-bit transfers. The 8-bit
support seems to be missing from the MMCv4 support implemented by
Philip Langdale .
To support 8-bit transfers the core needs to implement "bus testing
procedure". This requires support for CMD19 and CMD14.
Why is the support for bus testing procedure msiing from the MMCv4 support?
Regards,
Madhu
