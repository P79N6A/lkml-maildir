The reason that cifs switched from wait_for_completion to the kthread
call to cifs_demultiplex_thread in the first place is because without
use of kthread it won't work with a linux-vserver.   See the thread:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-cifs-client&m=117552761703381&w=2
If we take out the kthread call, we break those guys.
I agree that using sk_callbacks is worth looking into - I only found
ocfs2 and SunRPC (NFS) though that used it.   Is there a better
example though?   The NFS socket handling code is huge
(net/sunrpc/xprtsck.c) - something seems wrong when replacing a few
lines of code with a new 1675 line file.  There must be a better
example of doing what you suggest...
I am tempted to drop the socket timeout (which cifs sets to 7 seconds)
to a smaller number and not use signals at all rather than add that
much complexity
