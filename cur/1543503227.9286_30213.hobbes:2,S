I've been running 2.2.10ac10 for a week or so now and just noticed
that the inodes on my vfat partitions seem to vary between
boots. Needless to say this plays havoc with my incremental
backups. Has anyone else experienced this? The last kernel I was
running was 2.0.36 and it certainly wasn't happening there, but this
is the first 2.2.x kernel I've run for any length of time.
Any suggestions on how to change this behavior?
Gary
