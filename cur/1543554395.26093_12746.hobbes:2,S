I think it doesn't worth to break binary compatilibity at this late stage.

We can't in compatibilty mode because the rex regs are available _only_ in
64bit mode and even assuming the hardware would support that I would not
recommend that since as you said that binary would not run anymore on any other
x86 so causing pain.  Recompiling a program with native x86-64 gcc 64bit (that
uses the 64bit ABI) is the right way to go in that case (64bit mode uses 1
64bit register for long long as all other 64bit architectures of course).

Yes as in other systems, 32bit mode and 64bit mode needs different ABI and they
will coexist in the same system.
