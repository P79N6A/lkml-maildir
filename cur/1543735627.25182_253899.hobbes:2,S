I am trying to track this down. I tried moving the first segment of vmlinux
into the reserved section by modifying kexec-tools. This is the command line
argument segment. It still seems to need the first few kilobytes, though. 
Eliminating this is definitely needed so we can avoid using the first 
kernel's region completely.
Also, I will make the changes in the rest of the patch as per your review
comments.
Regards, Hari
