Yup, I was only looking at the O_SYNC code, as that's the only sync work that
AIM does.  I'll take a peek at the fdatasync() stuff as well.  BTW, I believe
that the O_SYNC flag also requires that (for strict POSIX compliance) we
write out the updated metadata (mtime, etc.) synchronously as well as the
data.  However, I also know that some operating systems don't do this unless
specifically requested by the user due to the additional performance
overhead.  Should we add in the capacity to perform synchronous metadata
updating as well?  Or perhaps better, just how much of a hack was the above?
:)  Thanks!
