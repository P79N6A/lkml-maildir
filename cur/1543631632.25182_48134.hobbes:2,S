Here is a patch to demonstrate which calls I'd like added. I'll send a
similar one to linux-mips if this interface looks ok...
This patch adds two functions, pci_dma_prep_single() and
pci_dma_prep_sg(), for a driver to relinquish a buffer to a PCI device
after having gained "ownership" via pci_dma_sync_*().  Essentially,
they should do whatever pci_map_*() does to prepare the buffer for
being accessed by the device, except for the mapping itself (e.g.
flush cache lines, copy to a bounce buffer if direction is
PCIDMA_TO_DEVICE, etc).
This is useful if one wants to use a buffer for making repeated DMA
transfers into a device without having to unmap the buffer. In such a
case, a typical usage would be:
	1) Take a buffer that is "owned" by the PCI device
	2) pci_dma_sync_single(...., PCIDMA_TO_DEVICE); buffer is
	   now owned by the driver
	3) Write into the buffer
	4) pci_dma_prep_single(...., PCIDMA_TO_DEVICE);
	5) Perform DMA transfer
	6) goto 1)
Thanks,
William
