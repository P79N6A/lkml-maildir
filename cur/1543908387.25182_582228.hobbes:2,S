i'll need the other bits of information too to have a complete picture 
about what's going on while your test is running - to maximize the 
chances of me being able to fix it. I'm a bit perplexed (and a bit 
worried) about this - you've spent _far_ more effort to _not send_ that 
script output (captured while the workload is running) than it would 
have taken to do it :-/ If you'd like me to fix bugs then please just 
send it (in private mail if you want) - or give me an ssh login to that 
box - whichever variant you prefer. Thanks,
	Ingo
