There may be several unrelated keyboard problems.
Since the very beginning there have been mysterious keyboard complaints.
There has been a single Linux version - I forgot - perhaps 1.1.74? -
where I would have a dead keyboard every few minutes, and the reason
was entirely unclear, it looked like the only variable was the timing
of the keyboard interrupt, and the next kernel version all problems
were gone again (with no change in keyboard code).
This is the "keyboard-only" problem. The situation is a bit worse
when there is interaction with a PS/2 mouse.
I have entertained the theory that reacting either very quickly or
very slowly is OK, but reacting a bit quickly (to the kbd interrupt)
is wrong.
Idle speculation.
