Yes, it's basically a problem of making sure reiserfs_link sees any
changes made by reiserfs_unlink and vice versa.  Toss in the BKL and a
few funcs that schedule and you get small windows where the object
you're linking to can have a inode->i_nlink of zero.
All of which is dealt with properly at the VFS level.  The trick in
reiserfs is that somebody needs to take care of removing the savelink
used to prevent lost files after a crash.  If we don't get the i_nlink
timing right, two different procs might try to remove the savelink, or
it might not get removed at all.

Looks fine.
