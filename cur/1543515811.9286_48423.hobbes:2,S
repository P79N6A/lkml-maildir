  That's really up to Linus to decide: I'm slowly feeding him the
patches, and so far he hasn't refused anything...

  If you want to help in the testing of the NFSv3 client for
linux-2.3, then I have already made patches available on the usual
place:
      
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src
In addition, they have been checked in to the Linux-NFS CVS repository
on sourceforge. Please read the NFS archives on
http://lists.varesearch.com/archives/nfs
 for details on how to check
out sources from the CVS repository.
Cheers,
  Trond
