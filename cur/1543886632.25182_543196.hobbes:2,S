Either use accessors or use your own lguest-specific remapping function that

Well, it's the same problem really.  You want to treat it as host virtual
in some places and and guest physical in others, but you need to keep
the abstraction clean.  To keep that absraction clean you introduce
accessors that contain the __force cast.  Now that you have these accessors
instead of random casts you need to think a bit where the host virtual
abstraction makes more sense and were the the guest virtual abstraction
makes more sense and use it consistantly there with as few as possible
uses of the accessors in between. 
Now to something different than the technical content of this mail:

Please stop this crap.  I know who I am, so there's no need to waste
mail estate with saying Hi.  Also please stop being a total fuckass
and abusing my lastname just because you didn't get what was in the
mail.
