Most people used it for as much arbitrary commands as they could.

WRITE_SECTOR?
IDE version of HDIO_DRIVE_CMD only implements READ_SECTOR and it is
already an abuse of this ioctl (because it does PIO-in command if buffer
is provided and no-data command otherwise).

IMO it is a perfect moment to add one generic interface and start
deprecating three strange ioctls (HDIO_DRIVE_CMD / HDIO_DRIVE_TASK / 
HDIO_DRIVE_TASKFILE).
