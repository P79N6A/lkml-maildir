FWIW, I really like this model.
Just as another example, for the I2C driver i2c-mpc, almost the only
variation between model is the clock selection and that forced to put
some processor specific stuff into the driver. With that model, you could
easly avoid theses platform/cpu specific stuff and isolate them.
USB with some really alike bus glues comes to mind too ...
Being able to do "action" in plus of just passing parameters is really nice
IMHO.
