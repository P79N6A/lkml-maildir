Hi,
I think I found where the NULL may come from.  Please, anybody, do not
apply this patch before a trustful person reviewed it... Jens? ;)
My thoughts on this are, that there are two possibilities cfqq->next_rq
could be NULL: End of list or a bug when it is set (or not set).
But why does RB_EMPTY_ROOT() as last call in this loop does not trigger?
Did I even get the right place on where the NULL pointer dereference
happens? :)
