That changed during the lock-free dcache implementation during
2.5. If we strictly update the lru list, we will have to acquire
the dcache_lock in __d_lookup() on a successful lookup. So we
did lazy-lru, leave the dentries with non-zero refcounts
and clean them up later when we acquire dcache_lock for other
purposes.
