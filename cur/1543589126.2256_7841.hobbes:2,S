tmpfs is ramfs+swap+limits. It is not using ramdisks and is not
related to them.

Probably yes, since you spare a little bit kernel memory. most of
tmpfs is unconditionally in the kernel for shared mappings. So the
actual CONFIG_TMPFS only adds some small functions to the kernel to
export this to usre space.
