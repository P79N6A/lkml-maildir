Hi,
I faintly recall reading about "invalidate: busy buffer" or "invalidate:
dirty buffer" fixes in recent 2.4.19-pre-/ac kernels. However, during
vgscan, I still get lots of these.
Also, for a 3C900 Combo card, I get this:
3c59x: Donald Becker and others. www.scyld.com/network/vortex.html
00:09.0: 3Com PCI 3c900 Boomerang 10Mbps Combo at 0xd000. Vers LK1.1.17
 ***WARNING*** No MII transceivers found!
Being a 10 Mbps card with BNC and AUI interfaces, it does not really
need an MII, so I don't quite get the meaning of the warning. It might
be disabled.
