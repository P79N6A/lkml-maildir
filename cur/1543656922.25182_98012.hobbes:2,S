Can you please try another thing?
kernel/sched.c
        /*
         * If the child was a (relative-) CPU hog then decrease
         * the sleep_avg of the parent as well.  
         */
        if (p->sleep_avg < p->parent->sleep_avg)
                p->parent->sleep_avg = (p->parent->sleep_avg * exit_weight +
                        p->sleep_avg) / (exit_weight + 1);
Remove these please and run again.
ciao, Marc
