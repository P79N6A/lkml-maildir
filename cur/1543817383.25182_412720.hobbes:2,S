I'd actually suggest deprecating ioremap() and moving away from it to
make sure all users think of which variant they want. Explicit naming is
always better than "some" unknown behavior (especially for old drivers
that work on multiple kernels... while you allow them to keep compiling,
you change the world under them so I think eventually break them
compiling is actually better than having them limp along broken)
