Well, this was what adq and myself did with libdvbapi and mti, (much
before UIO was announced at LK.) It is not tied to I2C either.
But, according to your statements (with regards to i2c-dev) you can
handle only some I2C based devices, which is in fact a subset of a
subset. Also not to forget that hardly a few I2C devices are in fact
"truly" I2C compatible. In fact many variables to be considered.
Also there is to consider a non technical aspect, whether vendors will
misuse this interface for binary only, undermining the efforts put in
for OSS drivers.
