Having the ability to produce a backtrace _anywhere within the kernel_ 
is a pretty fundamental thing too. So IMO the problems with stacktrace 
were the stack dumping code's weaknesses, independent of lockdep, and 
they would have triggered in one way or another as well. Not that i 
think that doing a dwarf unwinder is simple - and you certainly did a 
great job with it. Now with stacktrace we do have a pretty powerful 
infrastructure to do transparent execution tracing: for example the 
page-tracing code could be changed to use stacktrace.

maybe, but i find that unrobust too. Example: i debugged many 
early-bootup hangs via the use of an early_printk() based function 
execution tracer (a feature of the latency tracing patchset) - the lack 
of working 'current' would hit that code too.
Yes, it can all be worked around, but the fundamental weakness IMO is 
that we dont have a working 'current' in all situations.

yes. And move all of this _outside_ the normal kernel build process, so 
that whatever ad-hoc or less ad-hoc instrumentation is added (be that 
PROFILE_UNLIKELY, function tracing, 'get_current' based hacks, irqtrace, 
lockdep or whatever) it wont be included in that code. That gets rid of
most of the dependency and bootstrap problems. It's hard enough already
to debug early boot code.
