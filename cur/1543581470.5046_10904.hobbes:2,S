1) Bug: Introduced memory leak by replacing "goto err_out" with "return
err"
2) Sole usage of 'err' -- it should be scoped inside the pdev!=NULL
check.

Rejected.  Introduces bug.  That zero is required!

rejected -- already in AC patches (and merged into my tree as well)

Rejected.  The maintainer clearly wanted the "/* = 0 */" present, yet
you remove them.  I'm suspicious of the acpi_idle_state initialization
removal as well, but can't check it quickly at present (acpi_idle_state
is gone in my tree)

rejected -- already in AC and my own patches
All the rest were applied.
