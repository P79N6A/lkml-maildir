Hope a lspci -v would also help :-D
If not i must ask for the output again...
First controller:
0000:00:09.0 I2O: Distributed Processing Technology SmartRAID V 
Controller (rev 02) (prog-if 01)
	Subsystem: Distributed Processing Technology 2400A UDMA Four Channel
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 17
	BIST result: 00
	Memory at d0000000 (32-bit, prefetchable)
	Capabilities: [80] Power Management version 2
0000:00:09.1 PCI bridge: Distributed Processing Technology PCI Bridge 
(rev 02) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64
	Bus: primary=00, secondary=02, subordinate=02, sec-latency=64
	Expansion ROM at 0000a000 [disabled] [size=4K]
	Capabilities: [68] Power Management version 2
Second controller:
0000:00:0c.0 I2O: Distributed Processing Technology SmartRAID V 
Controller (rev 02) (prog-if 01)
	Subsystem: Distributed Processing Technology 2400A UDMA Four Channel
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 19

	Capabilities: [80] Power Management version 2
0000:00:0c.1 PCI bridge: Distributed Processing Technology PCI Bridge 
(rev 02) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64
	Bus: primary=00, secondary=03, subordinate=03, sec-latency=64
	I/O behind bridge: 0000b000-0000bfff
	Expansion ROM at 0000b000 [disabled] [size=4K]
	Capabilities: [68] Power Management version 2

I don't know the hardware part very vell :-( But because i'm not the 
author of the driver i don't think there is something wrong :-)
