in Linux there's no difference between the scheduling of 'threads' and
'processes'. Both are internally a 'task'. If two tasks share the same
MM (this is possible via the use of clone()) then they are called
threads. If a task has its own MM (normally created via fork()) then
it's called a process - but the scheduler doesnt care.
so the normal Linux scheduling policy applies to 'threads' too. Fully
preemptable, SCHED_NORMAL by default, or SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR if you set
it. The priority (or rt_priority) can be set per-task as well. Newly
created threads/processes may inherit (or not) the policy of the parent,
this largely depends on the library implementation.
