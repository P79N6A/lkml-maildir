I don't know the make of the motherboard without actually pulling the box 
apart. The system was designed and used in hotels for Internet access in 
rooms to start with... I picked it up after they were replaced about a year 
ago.
It's unusual, because it has a PCI chipset, yet only has a couple of ISA 
slots. I've been enabling PCI mainly out of habit and in case anything on the 
motherboard was using the bus (apparently not), but I wouldn't be surprised 
if the PCI chipset is basically broken, since it wasn't really needed.

Could be applicable, given that video and audio are handled on-board. I might 
have to open her up tomorrow and have a poke around.

I've had them on and off, they don't affect the booting problem.
I'll build a kernel using the BIOS access mode (as suggested by Alan) 
tomorrow and see if that clears it up.
