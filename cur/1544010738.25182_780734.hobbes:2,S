Hi Pierre,
If I change the last line above to
	&& defined(CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI_MODULE)
then it builds OK.  Using !defined still has build errors...
and I think that my small change is also correct.
However, I'd prefer to see this done with Kconfig and then use
empty stubs for the functions that wouldn't be called.
I think that you should audit the other uses of
#if defined(CONFIG_LEDS_CLASS) || defined(CONFIG_LEDS_CLASS_MODULE)
in sdhci.c as well.
Also, in sdhci_add_host(), why is the call to free_irq() inside the
CONFIG_LEDS block:
#if defined(CONFIG_LEDS_CLASS) || defined(CONFIG_LEDS_CLASS_MODULE)
reset:
	sdhci_reset(host, SDHCI_RESET_ALL);
	free_irq(host->irq, host);
#endif
HTH.
