Of course; that's obvious.  What's perhaps less obvious is that I'm
suggesting a change in the calculation of timeout -- a change which
avoids the creation of unnecessarily large _intermediate_ values.

Well, I forgot the (unsigned long) cast, as someone else noted:
	timeout = ROUND_UP((unsigned long) timeout, 1000/HZ);
Otherwise, the code is Just Right.
