Hi!
It is ... strange.
I run swsusp patched kernel, do 20 suspend resume cycles. Reboot,
sync, reset button to force fsck.
fsck cames up basically okay.... But when filesystems are mounted, I
see "freeing block not in datazone".
Another sync and reset button, this time fsck manually... Severe
corruption in there. It looks like fsck failed to do its job. This is
ext2.
Strange, *STRANGE*.
