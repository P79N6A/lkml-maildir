There are two kinds of Oopses. One that simply kill the offending
process, and the system continues. The other simply hangs the machine
because "nothing more can be done". Usually "killing interrupt handler, 
killing idle task", and then "game over". 
This last type is the one where klogd and syslogd try to log
synchronously, but don't get a chance.
