I'm seeing this message quite often with one Linux 2.4.7 system
automounting another.  As long as A has B's filesystem mounted, all is
ok.  Then A times out, unmounts, and later wants to remount B's
filesystem.  Then, sometimes, I see a message much like yours.
It doesn't seem to need a reboot to cause this problem, and the fix I
have found is to kill and restart the NFS server: /etc/init.d/nfs
restart.
I have no idea why it happens, or why restarting nfsd or mountd fixes it.
