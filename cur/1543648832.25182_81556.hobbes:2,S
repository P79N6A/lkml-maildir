I see.
I assume the kernel implementation is no big deal: epoll_addf() has to
call the kernel internal equivalent to poll() with a zero timeout.
This wouldn't break the first "solution" in my earlier post, but it
would cause every new connection to experience one extra EAGAIN.  
I see three possibilities:
  1) keep the current epoll_addf()
  2) modify it as John suggests, posting the initial ready state in 
     the next epoll_getevents()
  3) both: add an option to epoll_addf() that says which of 1 or 2 is desired.

How hard would it be to modify the current epoll code to work that
way?  I'd assume it's just a matter having epoll_addf call the legacy
poll() code to check the condition (with a zero timeout).
