Subject: More errors compiling kernel with GCC 3.1

I'm just trying to read the source code, and I am having trouble in a 
few areas.  For example, I am completely baffled by the number of macros 
that get called in some places.  For example, in the semaphore code... 
just wondering why DECLARE_MUTEX (macro) calls DECLARE_SEMAPHORE_GENERIC 
(macro) calls SEMAPHORE_INITIALIZER (macro) calls 
WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD_INITIALIZER (macro) and so on, and so on...
I guess I can understand the use of a macro to deal with the overhead
introduced by calling functions all over the place, but having this
many macros that call macros isn't clear to me... I just hope that it
wasn't done to make the code easier to read or something :).
Can anyone point me to some documentation that might explain this type 
of thing?
