Do you have any details.  I would like to figure out what it takes to
export MAP_DENYWRITE safely to userspace.
Currently checking to see if the file is executable looks good
enough.  I don't see any case where this would be a problem, unless
someone has set their permissions wrong.  
The fix for bad permission (during a DOS attack) is either:
	chmod correct_permissions foo
	lsof foo | xargs kill
or:
        chmod correct_permissions foo
	mv foo bar
        cp -a bar foo
        rm bar
Which looks fairly straight forward.
