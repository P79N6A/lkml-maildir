Has the quoted speed ever been correct? I'd be very surprised if it has,
since there are / never were any workarounds for this model. Besides,
the speed printed is reported directly by the drive, so the only solution
is to correct known problematic drives -- which hardly seems worthwile
as the error is indeed just a cosmetic problem.
