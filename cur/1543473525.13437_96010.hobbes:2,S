Subject: Small 2.2.pre1 bugfix for ipconfig.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
this is a small patch for a Bug which prevented us from booting a recent
Developer Kernel (including 2.2-pre1) via Netboot and Boot-Eprom.
We don't use rarp or bootp whitin the Kernel. This part is managed by the
neboot-Loader.
All this worked fine using the 2.0 Kernel Series and works again whit our
small patch applied.
Anyway I don't realy understand the whole code inside ipconfig.c so probably
somebody with a further knowledge should review this.
The patch has been sent to Martin Mares, the Author of this
particular Code a few weeks ago. But there has been no Responce, that's why
I repost this to the Kernel List today.
I hope that this or a simular fix will make it into 2.2
Regards
Sven
