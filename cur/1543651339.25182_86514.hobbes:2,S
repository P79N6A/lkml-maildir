ssh host make -C $tree oldconfig ARCH=arm
that doesn't allocate a terminal.  I want such commands to _prompt_ for
input.  If they die because its not a terminal, I consider that _broken_.
Why?  The command is able to read input from a human, and write its output
to a human via the ssh pipes.
If you insist on breaking this, I'll insist on fixing it.  Its a misfeature
that you refuse to run in this situation.
