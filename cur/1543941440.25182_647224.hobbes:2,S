I hate it when I am confused.  I misunderstood what Dean had been saying.
After I looked at his test case and remembering his screen at the time
we were discussing, I am nearly positive that both the parent and child
were still running (no exec, no exit).  We would therefore have two refs
on the page and, yes, be changing the pte which would warrant the callout.
Now I really need to think this through more.  Sounds like a good thing
for Monday.
Thanks,
Robin
