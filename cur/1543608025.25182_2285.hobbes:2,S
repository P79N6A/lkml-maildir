Subject: Local APIC option (CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC) locks up Inspiron 8100

I just bought a Dell Inspiron 8100. <long story of what happened snipped>. 
So after a few dozen kernel builds I've narrowed it down to this: When I 
build the 2.4.13 kernel with Local APIC support (CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y), two 
things happen (so far that i've noticed):
1) The power button stops working, as if the kernel was intercepting the 
signal and ignoring it. I have to hold it for five seconds to turn off the 
machine.
2) Anytime I change the plugged-in status of the AC adapter (if it wasn't 
plugged in, if I plug it in; if it was plugged in, if I unplug it), the 
machine locks up completely.
As the help on this option has no warnings about it being dangerous to use, 
I would really like to help find out what part of it is locking up. The 
only problem, is... I have no idea where to start.
One other thing: how would the kernel react to the "SpeedStep" feature of 
changing the CPU speed while things are still running?
