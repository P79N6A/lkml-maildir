Subject: [PATCH][0/8] updated arch agnostic completely out of line locks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/3/404

In brief, updates from the previous patches are;
- runtime tested on sparc64 (thanks Bill)
- modified ARM profile_pc (not entirely sure about this one)
- updated size comparison data from i386 as spotted by Linus
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This patch achieves out of line spinlocks by creating kernel/spinlock.c
and using the _raw_* inline locking functions. Now, as much as this is
supposed to be arch agnostic, there was still a fair amount of rummaging
about in archs, mostly for the cases where the arch already has out of
line locks and i wanted to avoid the extra call, saving that extra call
also makes lock profiling easier. PPC32/64 was an example of such an arch
and i have added the necessary profile_pc() function as an example.
Size differences are with CONFIG_PREEMPT enabled since we wanted to
determine how much could be saved by moving that lot out of line too.

It has been compile tested (UP, SMP, PREEMPT) on i386, x86-64, sparc,
sparc64, ppc64, ppc32 and runtime tested on i386, x86-64 and sparc64. I
still have to get benchmarks done (most probably i386).
Thanks,
