POSIX 1003.1 says this about aio_read() and aio_write():
	If an error condition is encountered during queuing, the function
	call shall return without having initiated or queued the request.
If you intend to ever allow a POSIX wrapper to these interfaces (I have
one, for instance), you need to return EINVAL, EBADF, and the like from
io_submit().  Note that io_submit() has read-like semantics, so an
additional call may be necessary if some iocbs were successfully queued.
A user has to handle EAGAIN, so io_submit() cannot return void, and you
already have error handling logic here.
