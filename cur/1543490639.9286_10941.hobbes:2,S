Are there any type of diagnostics that I can run for an IDE tape drive
or is anyone aware of problems with this type of configuration and Linux?&nbsp;
The kernel is 2.0.36 with a Seagate CTT8000 which is a 4GB TR4 type tape
drive in a Gateway box.&nbsp; The system has been running for about 18
months and the drive runs fine for about 5-7 months, and then we start
getting various errors like:<BR>
<BR>
<TT>mml1:/usr/adm# tar -tvf /dev/ht0</TT>
<BR><TT>tar: Cannot open /dev/ht0: I/O error</TT>
<BR><TT>tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now</TT>
<BR><TT>mml1:/usr/adm# mt -f /dev/ht0 rewind</TT>
<BR><TT>/dev/ht0: I/O error</TT>
<P>We swap tapes, old and new, clean the drive and nothing seems to resolve
the problem other than swapping the drive out.&nbsp; I'm not a fan of TR4's
but I have two SCSI versions of this same drive, CTT8000S, in a SCO and
(excuse me) NT machine and though I have had to swap out the SCO drive
once, the NT has been fine.
<P>The real pain is that GW is of NO help when we contact their support
line to replace a swap because we're not running WIN 95 or 98 on their
machine.&nbsp; It takes weeks of fighting with these people everytime to
get a replacement.&nbsp; I just want to make sure that there isn't something
else that I'm missing...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>TIA<BR>
