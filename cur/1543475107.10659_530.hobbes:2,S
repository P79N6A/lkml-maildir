I'm trying to get 2.2.0-pre4 working for me, but the machine I'm testing
on serves as a dhcpd server.  The dhcpd docs say that in 2.1.x you need to
do a "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_bootp_agent" to get it to work.
HOWEVER, there is NO ip_bootp_agent in the directoy when using 2.2.0-pre4.
What am I missing?  Is this a networking options thing I missed?
Thanks!!
