There are two cpus, and SigtranServices is multithreaded with many 
threads.  Most of these threads are affined to cpu0, a couple to cpu1. 
None of the threads are realtime.
Top is showing 37% idle on cpu0, and 6% idle on cpu1, so not all the cpu 
is being consumed.  However, I'm wondering if we're hitting bursty bits 
and we're just running out of time.
I'm going to try a system with MAX_SOFTIRQ_RESTART bumped up a bit, and 
also enable profiling.
