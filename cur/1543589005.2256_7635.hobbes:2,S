Well, it says 'Automatically select best transport', and Autoconfigure
doesn't succeed. With or without ip_masq_raudio.

I confirm it uses TCP for streaming (I just looked with ethereal). The
problem is that when insmoding ip_masq_raudio on the firewall,
realplayer just hangs when buffering - if the server only supported UDP,
I suspect it would negociate TCP or something like that.
