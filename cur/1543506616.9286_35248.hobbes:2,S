Subject: 2.3.xx: scsi module, unresolved symbol

Just got a bit worried about broken scsi/module with 2.3.xx.
I found that init_task_union is unresolved in scsi_mod.o and
init_task_union
is in none of the other modules.
As noted (on LK) adding EXPORT_SYMBOL(init_task_union); to ..._ksyms.c
would make
scsi_mod happy and make scsi work again, but i suppose this is not the way
to go ? ( i can't find any other compiled module which uses this
init_task_union)
Should scsi_error.c (init_task.fs) be fixed instead ?
Can someone enlighten me please?
I tried the EXPORT_SYMBOL thing but found kernel complaining when using
xcdroast like:
Aug 21 19:40:24 sjoerd kernel: cdrom: pid 995 is buggy!
But i'm not sure it's related.
PS, is found a warning when compiling scsi.c and changed:
