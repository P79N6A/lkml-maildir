Ok, "errors=remount-ro" is good enough for me.  For the record, do
non-historic disks with a few bad blocks still exist?  I though the
driver firmware already detected those and used spare blocks at one
side of the disk as a replacement.  Nicely visible when sequential
read performance over the whole disk has a few non-continuous spots.
