Well actually I find it quite interesting...
One thing that seems to have been alluded to but not explicity stated
is just where is this patch going, and what affect will happen when
running a non 'VM friendly' OS under the 'new plex86'.
One thing that I'm curious about is how say thing'd work when running
a linux host, with a VM-friendly linux client,  and say a Win-2k
client.
I assume that the Win-2k client woudl end up having to trap to a
simulator (bochs) for it's ring 0 stuff.  But would things in the
above scenario work nicely,  with proper isolation between the
two (or more) clients?
