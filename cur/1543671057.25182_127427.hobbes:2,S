I did, there are several valid points, I forgot the sys_accept case, I'm
studying the code to see how to properly fix it, but one thing I want covered
is keeping the net_families registered while there is still a struct sock
associated with the proto family, while not allowing the criation of new sockets
till the last struct sock is sk_freed.
Think about protecting the module with the top level network protocol family
->create code on sock_create level and the modules with specific protocols at
<net_proto_family>_sock_create level.

I'm think that this can be handled at this protocol family code level, i.e.  if
the net_proto_family wants to further modularise based on specific protocol
type this has to be refcounted at this level, example, at bt_sock_create.

That is a way to solve it, yes, but I don't think the only one,
net_proto_family has to do with the struct sock as those data structures are
related to the network protocol family.

I'm studying how to signal that the net_proto_family was unregistered while
still having the entry in net_families available, that is a problem with the
current infrastructure in Linus tree.
Sorry, today I didn't had time to work on this at night at home, but tomorrow
I'll be working on this, thing is, as I'm working only on having the
infrastructure in place and no protocols have ->owner set there is no way to
trigger the problems discussed in this message in any way.
Ah, and thanks for raising these issues and pointing me to the previous
discussion that I had not read before, just too much e-mail on lkml, netdev
is more manageable :-)
