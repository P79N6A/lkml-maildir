Did you mean, "anything *newer* than -git6" ??
This last crash was with -git4.  I'm building -git7 now.

For the ooops I just posted, yes, I may have left Linux ckermit
running on the serial port before the suspend.
We shouldn't be oopsing regardless, but perhaps that could help
narrow things down a bit.
I'll also retest the simple plug-unplug-oops crash reported earlier,
once I have rc3-git7 up and running.
Cheers
