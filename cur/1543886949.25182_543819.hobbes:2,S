Video mode detection (including "scan") seemed to work just the same as before.
 As for memory detection, my 512M x86-64 UP system is probably not what you had
in mind, and I don't really know what goes on for APM or how to test it.
As well, I've been looking through the actual code, and even with my very
limited experience with x86 assembler and operating systems, I now at least have
an idea of what is going on.  So switching to C for as much of the code as
possible seems like the right idea if you want to make it easier for new people
to get involved in that area of the kernel.
