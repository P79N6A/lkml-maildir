What applications would do better by postponing some of the reading? 
I can't think of any reason off the top of my head why an application
wouldn't want to read everything it can.  Doing everything in smaller
chunks would increase overhead (but maybe reduce latencies very slightly
-- albeit probably not much when using a get_events()-style interface).
Isn't it probably better to keep the kernel implementation as efficient
as possible so that the majority of applications which will read (and
write) all data possible can do it as efficiently as possible?  Queueing
up the events, even as they are in the form received from the kernel, is
pretty simple for a userspace program to do, and I think it's the best
place for it.
I know nothing about any other implementations, though, and I'm speaking
mainly from the experiences I've had with coding daemons using select(). 
You mention you wrote a paper discussing this issue...Where could I find
this?
