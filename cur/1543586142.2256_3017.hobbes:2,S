Why are they logged in as root in the first place? Is there something they
can't do over sudo?
I definitely remember seeing a document saying `if you find yourself needing to
`man foo', do it in another terminal as your non-root self'; it might or might
not've been the SAG.
In any case, what happened to `if you use this rope you will hang yourself'?
There has to be a point where you abandon catering for all kinds of fool and
get on with writing something useful, I think.
