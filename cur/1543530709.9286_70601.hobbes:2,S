Hi.
I'm having problems getting my Xircom 10/100 Mbit PCMCIA (model
rbe-100)network card 
functioning on my Compaq Armada M700 notebook, and I've had problems
since kernel 2.3.37.
Instead of trying to interpret the problems myself, I will post relevent 
sections from the system-log. I attached my .config. Cardctl is version
3.1.13
bootup:
 Mar 19 13:08:52 afu kernel: Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.11 
 Mar 19 13:08:52 afu kernel:   options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]

After bootup cardmgr reports a 5V card. Removing and inserting the card
results in:
