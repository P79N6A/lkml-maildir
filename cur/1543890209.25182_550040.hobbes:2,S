I believe it adds _way_ too many notifiers.

80 columns. Anyway yes, this one is needed.

Symetrical with the previous one, useful for freeing firmware images, ok.

What is this one good for?

Does this one need to be different from POST_THAW?
I do not see the need for the other chains. Notice that we do not
_want_ to have too many of them, because changing anything in the
hibernation will become impossible with 10 chains having intimate
details of suspend sequence.
