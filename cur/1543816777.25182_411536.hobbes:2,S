Replacing works for me, after also replacing the two first patches of
the series with their new respective version. As for the changelog I
picked the one from the original third patch.

Well, the first two patches (workqueue and cleanup) look ok to me now,
so I'll send them to Greg now, together with one similar patch for the
ds1374 driver. The workqueue patches need to go to Linus soon, as they
fix a bug in these drivers, and I know that Greg has other i2c patches
waiting to go to Linus anyway. The cleanup patch can go in too, I
think, as it's simple enough.
As for the third patch, I have some more comments on it (sorry for
being slow) and it might need some tweaking, so it's probably better
(and easier) if Andrew just drops it for now, and it'll get back to him
when ready.
Mark, is it OK if this third patch adding the m41t81 and m41t85 support
spends some time in Andrew's tree and only goes in mainline for 2.6.18,
or do you need it in 2.6.17?
Thanks,
