If CONFIG_PCMCIA=y, CONFIG_PHONE!=n and CONFIG_IXJ=m, the resultant
ixj.o will support the (PCMCIA) internet phonecard, provided it is
insmod(8)ed as ixj_cs.o.
As such, were make modules_install (iff the above config) to:
  mkdir $(MODDIR)/kernel/drivers/telephony/pcmcia
  ln -s ../ixj.o $(MODDIR)/kernel/drivers/telephony/pcmcia/ixj_cs.o
things would Just Work.
But that just doesn't seem like the right solution.
Looks like were $(TOPDIR)/drivers/telephon/pcmcia to exist with
a suitable makefile to cp ../ixj.o ixj_cs.o iff the above config
things would also just work.
But I suspect ixj.c needs to be broken out, perhaps to ixj.c,
ixj-main.c and pcmcia/ixj_cs.c?  Or just a pcmcia/ixj_cs.c which
links against ../ixj.o?
What is the proper solution?
(And, for that matter, is this essentially the same problem the drm
tree has wrt modules?)
