Sure, it doesn't, because the other thread is about to issue
a writeout on them. But it does mean that there is no guarantee
that those pages are already marked as writeback when 
filemap_fdatawrite returns and filemap_fdatawait is called.

But filemap_fdatawait does not look at the page lock. So there's a
tiny window when the page is on locked_pages with PG_dirty cleared
and PG_writeback not set. Does that make sense, or is there something
I overlook ?
Daniel's patch precisely tried to fill that gap - he added a check for page 
lock in filemap_datawait.
