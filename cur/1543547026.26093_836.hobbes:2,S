  To give you a datapoint we have .5Tb arrays both hardware and software
and they will both take around 10 hours to resync and a good 30mins
to fsck, even mounting them will take 30 seconds or so.  If you have
lots of data on your discs then the fsck will take longer still.  For
large discs you *really* want journalling and you really don't want a power
outage/disc failure to cause a resync.
  For filesystems of this size if you really care about downtime you
might want to look at some of the commercial solutions eg Network Appliance
NFS servers (
http://www.netapp.com
).  We've measured a netapp box with 1.4TB
at 2 minutes from pulling the power to back online and serving data.
