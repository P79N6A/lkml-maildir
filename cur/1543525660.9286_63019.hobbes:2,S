I had such a problem once with 2.3.43-pre5: netscape didn't load. It
failed several times. Then I rebooted, and the problem was gone.
I cannot imagine that the tlb changes caused these problems: tlb error
would cause sporadic, not persistent problems.
Perhaps a page/buffer-cache problem? I tested my tlb changes mostly with
shm, and 2.3.43 contains a major ll_rw_blk update.
