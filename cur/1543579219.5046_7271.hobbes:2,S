Ah.  Thanks. That stuff was actually design-from-memory :)  I'll take
a closer look when I have something other than a clockwork computer.

This statement of mine was grade-A bollocks.  printk cannot of
course call down().  It needs to use __down_trylock and buffer
it up if it fails. (faster, too!)
The subtler problem will be interrupt-capable drivers which
do a bare spin_lock() to serialise wrt their interrupt routines,
relying upon interrupts being disabled.  They'll be deadlocky
and will need changing.  That's trivial to find and fix though.
Anyway, this was just a heads-up that I'll be looking at
this stuff.  Please allow me a week or so to provide
some substance.  I read that the fbdev developers have
been seeking a fix for this for some time, so it seems
worth some effort.
