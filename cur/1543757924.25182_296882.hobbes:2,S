Subject: [PATCH] override RLIMIT_SIGPENDING for non-RT signals
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Indeed, I think your patch does not go far enough.  I can read POSIX to say
that the siginfo_t data must be available when `kill' was used, as well.
This patch makes it allocate the siginfo_t, even when that exceeds
{RLIMIT_SIGPENDING}, for any non-RT signal (< SIGRTMIN) not sent by
sigqueue (actually, any signal that couldn't have been faked by a sigqueue
call).  Of course, in an extreme memory shortage situation, you are SOL and
violate POSIX a little before you die horribly from being out of memory anyway.
The LEGACY_QUEUE logic already ensures that, for non-RT signals, at most
one is ever on the queue.  So there really is no risk at all of unbounded
resource consumption; the usage can reach {RLIMIT_SIGPENDING} + 31, is all.
It's already the case that the limit can be exceeded by (in theory) up to
{RLIMIT_NPROC}-1 in race conditions because the bump and the limit check
are not atomic.  (Obviously you can only get anywhere near that many with
assloads of preemption, but exceeding it by a few is not too unlikely.)
This patch also fixes that accounting so that it should not be possible to
exceed {RLIMIT_SIGPENDING} + SIGRTMIN-1 queue items per user in races.
Thanks,
Roland
