You must be very careful when playing with partial (read|write) memory
barriers. It is probably impossible to obtain such a semantic that applies
equally to all architectures. For example, as described in the Alpha
architecture Handbook, the Alpha WMB instruction (you seem to care about)
is only required to insert a barrier for WRITEs that are targetted to the
same kind of region (memory-like regions versus non memory-like regions).
As a result, the following scenario:
  WA: WRITE A TO MEMORY
  WB: WRITE B TO MMIO
      WMB
  WC: WRITE C TO MEMORY
  WD: WRITE D TO MMIO
only ensures WA to precede WC and WB to precede WD, as seen by other
agents on the system BUS. An agent seeing WB, WD, WA, WC is a quite legal
situation here.
Basically, such a Write Barrier can only be used when a single kind of
region is involved. This is rarely the case in driver/device pairs that
support DMA.
Btw, speaking for myself I have properly decided to ignore partial
barriers. IMO, situations where they make significant difference are
probably pretty rare. Obviously, the WMB can be very useful for combining
and flushing a batch of WRITEs to a frame buffer at a minimal cost but
this is a no-DMA situation and ordering is less critical here than in DMA
situations.
Speaking about the [sym|ncr]53c8xx drivers, there are some places where 
ordering is required for WRITEs targetting the both kinds of regions.
 
For example when an IO is queued to the controller:
1) QUEUE the IO to the START QUEUE (this queue is in main memory and 
                                    accessed by the device using DMA)
2) WRITE a FLAG to an IO REGISTER to tell the device about (MMIO)
"(1) then (2)" must not be reordered as seen by the PCI device. A WMB does
not help here since (1) writes some data to memory and (2) writes data to
MMIO (non memory-like).
