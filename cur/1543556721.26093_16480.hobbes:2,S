It looks like cs46xx version 1.10 is a winner.
Crystal 4280/461x + AC97 Audio, version 1.10, 07:08:39 Dec  7 2000

The cs46xx driver in test12-pre7 by Nils Faerber, Thomas Woller, et al works 
great with my troublesome Dell 420.  I'm now listening to music on the CD, 
running KDE 2.0 with the machine booted up on 2.4.0-test12-pre7.
Many thanks to all who helped with this.
