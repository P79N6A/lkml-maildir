But isn't that the problem: the application may have done things in a
previous lifetime that caused changes at the other end of the connection
that it is now unaware of.
However, it seems to me that this is no worse than what happens if the
application simply crashes, and in many ways better. Something I've
forgotten about EROS: can an application force a checkpoint? If so, then
I can't see how it can be in any way worse.
Cheers,
Ben.
