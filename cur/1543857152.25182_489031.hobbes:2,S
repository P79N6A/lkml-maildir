I could be wrong, but I think if we moved the mutex_lock to be inside of 
the list_for_each_entry loop, we could have a race condition.  For 
example, we obtain the next spu item from the spu_prio->active_mutex 
list, then wait on the mutex which is being held for the purpose of 
removing the very spu context we just obtained.

Arnd would certainly know the answer to this off the top of his head, 
but when I initially discussed the idea for this patch with him 
(probably a couple months ago or so), he didn't suggest a better 
alternative.  Perhaps there is a way to do this with current SPUFS 
code.  Arnd, any comments on this?

I'm not exactly sure what you're saying here.  Are you suggesting that a 
user may only be interested in acitve SPU notification and, therefore, 
shouldn't have to be depenent on the "standard" notification 
registration succeeding?  There may be a case for adding a new 
registration function, I suppose; although, I'm not aware of any other 
users of the SPUFS notification mechanism besides OProfile and PDT, and 
we need notification of both active and future SPU tasks.  But I would 
not object to a new function.

I won't pretend to be expert enough to critique the performance of that 
code.

For OProfile, the registration is only done at the time when a user 
starts the profiler to collect performance data, typically focusing on a 
single application, so I don't see this as an impact on normal 
production operations.  Since you must have root authority to run 
OProfile, it cannot be invoked by just any user for nefarious purposes.
