The funy parts:
1) there was already code, submitted by me that printed the error
message only once, saving quite a lot of time during bootup. For some
reason it was removed. (I guess there were broken keyboards that didn't
init if tried only once.)
2) you can't remove pc_keyb.c from the kernel - it's needed for support
of the USB keyboards. Yes, that's very very ugly, but without a major
rewrite of keyboard.c it's not possible elseway. You could turn off
pc_keyb.c's initialization, though, so it'd function as a library-only
module.
3) For correct support of AT and PS/2 keyboards .... well, you all
probably know about my input drivers (
