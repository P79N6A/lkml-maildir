Subject: [PATCH] Fix bug: BIO_RW_BARRIER requests to md/raid1 hang.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/22/575

The following fixes a rather embarassing bug in 2.6.16, and so should
go into 2.6.16.1, and 2.6.16-rc1.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
### Comments for Changeset
Both R1BIO_Barrier and R1BIO_Returned are 4 !!!!
This means that barrier requests don't get returned (i.e. b_endio
called) because it looks like they already have been.
