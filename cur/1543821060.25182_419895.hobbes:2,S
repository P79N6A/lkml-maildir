I've wondered about this too. It makes some sense to renforce the relationship 
with clone, but when you read the call to unshare you must do you get 
nonsense. Like the above incoherence.

I indeed agree with this. With 
cg log -r v2.6.16-rc1:v2.6.16 kernel/fork.c
We can see the people involved in commits for sys_unshare (there's little 
other work in there).
