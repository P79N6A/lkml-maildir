on bash i did this as:
  for ((i=0; i<3333; i++)); do ping 10.1 -A > /dev/null & done
and this quickly creates a monster-runqueue with tons of ping tasks 
pending. (i replaced 10.1 with the IP of another box on the same LAN as 
the testbox) Is this what should happen?

well, there's a natural saturation point after a few hundred tasks 
(depending on your CPU's speed), at which point there's no idle time 
left. From that point on things get slower progressively (and the 
ability of the shell to start new ping tasks is impacted as well), but 
that's expected on an overloaded system, isnt it?
