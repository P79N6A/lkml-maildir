> What operations are you using to implement spinlocks?
The cpu provides atomic exchange instruction (atomic Read/write
semantics) which forms the back end of spin lock code.
__raw_spin_trylock( ) atomically swaps the lock memory with a reg (set
to 1)
Using a pool of spinlocks rather that original idea of spinlock per
atomic_t anyways seems to be a better idea.
I really appreciate the responses. Thanks a lot
