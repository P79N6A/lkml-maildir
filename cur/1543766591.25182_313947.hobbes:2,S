What's an "rnic handle", in Linux terms?

Does that mean that the code has not yet been implemented?
Yes, a Linux fd is appropriate.  But we don't have any sane way right now
of saying "you need to run put_page() against all these pages in the
->release() handler".  That'll need to be coded by yourselves.

The kernel already has considerable resource management capabilities. 
Please consider using/extending/generalising those before inventing
anything new.  RLIMIT_MEMLOCK would be a starting point.

We don't want code in the kernel which will permit hostile unprivileged
users to trivially cause the box to lock up.  RLIMIT_MEMLOCK and, if
necessary, CAP_IPC_LOCK sound appropriate here.
