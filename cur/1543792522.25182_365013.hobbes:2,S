I'd rather not count the drivers that have dropped out of open source
operating systems due to bit rot. If there is no maintainer, the
hardware will become useless sooner or later. With Linux's rapidly
changing "moving target" 2.6.X I'd call it sooner rather than later.
OSS drivers are good iff there is a maintainer - IOW: to the user, the
maintainer makes the difference, not the driver being open source.
