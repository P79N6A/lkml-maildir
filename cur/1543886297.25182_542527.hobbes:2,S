You don't want this low level stuff in drivers.
All such details should be hidden away in the arch code, which in your 
case is the lguest support code.
lguest should present a nice, friendly driver API that any Computer 
Science freshman at university will understand.  Because that's the 
level at which we driver writers exist... :)

NAPI means system-wide load leveling, across multiple network 
interfaces.  Lack of NAPI can mean competition at higher loads.  Though 
maybe that's less important with lguest.

Bonding, and situations where you /do/ want the MAC address to "leak" 
out of the host onto the wider net.

Indeed -- they are useless for physical hardware, as well.
Those items have not been used since the ISA days.  Hardware is far more 
complex than those three variables can provide, so the wise choice is to 
SET_NETDEV_DEV() to your device, which reveals all manner of bus 
information by reference.
Storing information in those variables is needless duplication, which is 
why they have been relegated only to ancient ISA drivers -- or in the 
case of ->mem_start, repurposed as a method of passing options.

The net stack does not have a safety cushion.  Set the wrong flags, and 
things can and will go wrong.  SG without CSUM support is illogical, and 
can and will break things.  Remember what SG is for.  If you cannot 
offload the csum, you have to build the csum yourself, at which point 
you might as well copy it too.  grep around for skb_copy_and_csum_dev() 
to see if that helps you at all.

That's my point.  It won't work as a module, because it lacks remove 
support.  It is not unrealistic to think of [un|re|]loading the net 
support module in an lguest guest.  And, adding module support makes the 
programmer more responsible, because they now have to learn to clean up 
after themselves.  Any driver that cannot clean up after itself is an 
incomplete driver in my book.
