I have an app that mlocks hugepages. The same app works just fine in 2.6.14.
This app has 128MB or more of shared memory that is using hugepages via
mmap. When I try this, I get the error "can't allocate memory".  Is this a
kernel bug or is this not supported anymore.  I want to guarantee that
this memory doesn't get swapped out to a swap device. I made the same
modifications to include/linux/resource.h that was in 2.6.14, which
set MLOCK_LIMIT to 2GB.
Thanks
Don
