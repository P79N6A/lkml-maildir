I agree.  Isn't this exactly what HZ=1000 with VST achieves?  We
know this works already...

Having run VST on ARM, VST must be disabled while the bogomips
calibrations have completed - I suspect VST requires some sort of
enable/disable counted system like we do for interrupts and the hlt
thing, so that the hotplug CPU code can do it's bogomips calibration
appropriately.
