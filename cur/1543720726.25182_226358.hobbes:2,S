That sounds sane.

I'm _very_ leary of applying this.  It could be abused very badly
(by putting the platform_device as the first object in the structure and
relying on this function to kfree the whole thing.)  So sorry, but no.
Unless you show me a real need for it..
And as for the whitespace cleanup, why?  The lack of spaces seem to be
something that the original author liked doing.  There's nothing in the
kernel coding style guidelines that really mention it that I can see.
So, care to just send me the name change patch against the latest tree?
thanks,
