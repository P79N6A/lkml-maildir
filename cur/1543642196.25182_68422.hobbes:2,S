Hi,
I am runing RH linux-2.4.7-10 on a Dell Optiplex GX110 box (with 256Mb RAM). 
The system worked fine with networking support. I then added a virtual 
network driver (similar to 
ftp://ftp.linux.it/pub/People/Rubini/insane.tar.gz
) to the kernel. (There is 
no change made to drivers/net/loopback.c). I compile the kernel in usual 
steps (make dep, make clean, make bzImage, make modules, make 
modules_install). The compilation works fine. However, when I am booting the 
new kernel image, the system hangs at the prompt "bringing up interface 
lo:". It does not echo "[OK]".
The system boots fine in single user mode. When I ran
"/etc/rc.d/init.d/network start", it got stuck at "./ifup ifcfg-lo".
Infact, in the ifup script, it is halting at "ip addr add 
${IPADDR}/${PREFIX} brd
${BROADCAST:-+} dev ${REALDEVICE} .." called to add adrress for lo. I
checked that it is correctly using IPADDR=127.0.0.1.
Since the system works fine with old kernel image, I guess the problem is 
with the new kernel image. I shall appreciate any pointer on what may go 
wrong.
TIA.
Regards
Sakib
