I think limit is defined using FD_SETSIZE actualy, now it's my question:
- how can i change the max value allowed of tcp connection ?
- am i thinking bad if i think 256 is the limit of the max tcp connections
allowed simulta...?
It's a bit urgent ... could any reply me quick about this one?
thanks to all.
PD: if any could explain me about what i a get changed this value (problems
etc) it would be great.
