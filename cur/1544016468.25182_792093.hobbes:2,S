It reminds me. I wrote a basic variation of MCS spinlocks a while back. And
converted dcache lock to use it, which showed large dbench improvements on
a big machine (of course for different reasons than the dbench improvements
in this threaed).

Each "lock" object is sane in size because given set of spin-local queues may
only be used once per lock stack. But any spinlocks within a mutex acquisition
will always be at the bottom of such a stack anyway, by definition.
If you can use any code or concept for your code, that would be great.
