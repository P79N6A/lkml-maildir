Hi all I've posted in the past a problem with some CD-Writers and DVD 
Readers and this Chipset that at the boot time delivers problem of 
timings and gives the message {TimeOut for Command} .
Vojtek Pavlik made some patches for the problem, and have said that 
these will be included in the 2.4.21 kernel release. Now, I've changed 
my CD-Writer, and I haven't this problem again, I've tried to change my 
CD-Writer again with my old one and I've tried to burn a CD , the result 
was the failure of the CD-Burning process. Now the system start 
correctly , the read works correctly too, but  the burning of CD's 
doesn't work again. Now, this isn't a problem for me (I've said that 
I've changed my CD-Writer) , but for other people that can have this 
problem I hope that you can tune some setting in the Source, in order to 
make this work
Thanks
Bye
Marcello
