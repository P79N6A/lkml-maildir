HI al...
BEWARE: this kernel probably will eat your disk and your dog, but anyways...
Problems:
- I could not merge the Promise part of ide-convert-10 (due to a big update
  of in-kernel code), so I just dropped it. So Promise users are out of the
  marketshare. If things go this way, perhaps I will have to drop ide-10.
- I have added again the scalable-timers and irqrate-limiting patches.
  My box hangs on rmmod'ing modules with irqrate applied (SMP box, perhaps is
  a locking problem and UP is safe...), even without bproc. It also happened
  in previous releases, but I did not notice till recently. So irqrate
  improves latency, but kills the box ;).
The idea is to easy the way for Randy Hron to compare:
- rc2
- rc2-aa1
- rc2-jam1 minus irqrate == rc2-aa1 plus smptimers (that I think will not
  make a big difference)
- rc2-jam1 full == rc2-aa1 + smptimers + irqrate (if you don't rmmod anything...)
I hope this is usefull.
