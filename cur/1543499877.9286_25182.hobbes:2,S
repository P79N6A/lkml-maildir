Hello there,
i am just experiencing some problems with 2.3.7 (compiled with
egcs-2.91.60, which seemed OK so far), Pentium166/UP.
I have a directory mounted from an SGI (Irix6.4), and when trying
to read a file being written on the SGI at the same time, the reading
process gets stuck (it is accessing top of the file while at the end
something is appended). Here's an output from /var/log/warn the first
time this happened:
Jun 21 10:43:30 ingo kernel: hm, busy page invalidated? (not necesserily a bug)
Jun 21 10:43:30 ingo kernel: hm, busy page invalidated? (not necesserily a bug)
Jun 21 10:43:42 ingo kernel: nfs: server iris not responding, timed out
Jun 21 10:44:06 ingo last message repeated 2 times
Jun 21 10:45:06 ingo last message repeated 3 times
Jun 21 10:46:00 ingo last message repeated 3 times
Jun 21 10:46:00 ingo kernel: nfs_statfs: statfs error = 5
Jun 21 10:49:15 ingo kernel: nfs: server lulu not responding, timed out
All NFS-mounted filesystems got inaccessible, i had to reboot the
machine.
Right now the same happened, but only the reading process and the
filesystem mounted from the SGI are concerned, and there is no
entry in any logfile besides "nfs: server iris not responding, timed out".
I do not know if there is generally a problem with SGI-NFS, because
i also have some problems with scandir on this filesystem (programs
using scandir can't read directories, because at the end of the
directory EPERM is returned?!).
If there is any more information i should provide to help, please let
me know.
Regards,
Wolfgang
