Intel no doubt have a lovely list of errata but they aren't sharing them.
The -ac tree eepro100.c does have a couple of fixes I've now sent on to 
Linus to do with needed delays and a workaround for a problem with one
chip variant when running 10Mbit half duplex.
That driver might help. If you want to test it you only need to apply
the drivers/net/eepro100* part of the -ac patch just for that.
