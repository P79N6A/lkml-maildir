    This is not how IDE drives are supposed to act -- they won't proceed any 
further until "interrupt pending" condition is cleared, so these aren't 
supposed to be "stacked". This behavior however is not strictly specified by 
ATA standards IIRC, but I can't readily imagine such situaltion anyway unless 
tagged command queueing  (which is not supported by IDE core) and/or ATAPI 
command overlapping is in action...

    I could also imagine the HPT366 chip going mad and stalling the reads if 
the taskfile regs forever because of the incomplete DMA or even the drive 
going mad and not replying to I/O cycles with proper -IORDY handshake (i.e. 
holding it low all the time)...

    This means "DMA not complete".
