You didn't understand. I wasn't talikng about anything involved with
X11.
I was only proposing the implementation of the intendid functionality
with
the xterm as a source bas to start the actual implemnetation. This
doesn't
imply to rnecessarly run the X11 server itself at all!

Yes that's what I'm doing. I preffer to work under X11 if there is need
for
fluffy features. However one can't disable the unicode desease in the
current
kernel!
Read twice. With the design propsal properly implementid. (This still
needs to be done.)
You should be able to emulate anything you where talking about entierly
in
user space without polluting the console implementation in kernel.
