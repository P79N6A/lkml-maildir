What's you're not seeing is the additional patch to the "offical"
sources which is required to get a working ppc64 kernel.  It's not
in the offical sources due to it touching non-arch specific files.
I've included the relevent part of the patch you're not seeing below.  
You can find the full patch at www.penguinppc64.org.
