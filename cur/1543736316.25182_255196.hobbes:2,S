/dev/random used to be a source of high latencies, but Ingo's patches 
fix this.  There was not a lot of CPU overhead but the latency was was a
problem for serious audio use.  But, audio is a unique set of
requirements, it's somewhere between desktop and embedded and hard-RT.
This could certainly be a problem for the embedded folks due to space or
CPU concerns, but the latency problem seems to be solved.
