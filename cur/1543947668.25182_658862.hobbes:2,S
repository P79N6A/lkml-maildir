Well, that's what this code is like aswell.  That's why I recommended
to Eric to move it to init/ and make it look like that code.  I haven't
quite caught up with the discussion yet, but Eric think moving it
there might not be a that good idea.  Having this code in drivers/
even if it's just called in init time is a bad idea, as people will
copy it.  Then again using the functions the code was using before
isn't any better.
