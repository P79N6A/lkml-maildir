Hello Wei
This is the third time I receive this patch (and I am not able to comment it), 
and still you didnt send it to the right list.
Please use netdev@vger.kernel.org for any linux kernel networking stuff.
If you dont receive an acknowledge from this netdev list, please wait at least 
two weeks before resending it.
Thank you
Eric
