Hi Greg:
I am just wondering that is there any rule for stable kernel version
release?
AFAIK, 2.6.x kernels are all stable release and 2.6.x.y is for stable
tree bug fixing and long term supporting. But I found 2.6.16.y got 49
version updating, it is more active than other stable release such as
2.6.17 and 2.6.19. It looks like 2.6.16 is a long-long term supporting
version and even number 2.6.x kernel is more active than odd number
2.6.x kernel.
You know for some customer's product, they want to use the stable and
long term support kernel instead to use the latest one. 
Could you please give us some idea about this regular?
Thanks
