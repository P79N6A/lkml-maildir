The above bit needs to be captured in a code comment.  Because:

Is hair-raising and makes people want to come after you with a stick ;)
(And an 80-col xterm)
ugh, I see.  `struct key_ref' doesn't actually exist anywhere.  The code
only ever deals with pointers to this non-existent structure and they are
munged `struct key *'s.
Did this _have_ to happen?

This doesn't actually make things clear.

That's getting a bit intimate with how IS_ERR and PTR_ERR are implemented
but I guess we're unlikely to change that.
This all seems quite inappropriate to -rc2?
