Yeah, that was what I was thinking of... if you want to avoid the
branch in the fastpath, we could do something like
struct workqueue_s {
	cpu_workqueue_t *cpu_wq_ptr[NR_CPUS]
	cpu_workqueue_t cpu_wq[NR_CPUS];
};
and initialize the cpu_wq_ptr entries to 
	cpu_wq_ptr[i] = cpu_wq + i
in the multi-threaded case and to
	cpu_wq_ptr[i] = cpu_wq
in the single thread case.  The lookup in queue_work() becomes 
	cpu_workqueue_t *cwq = wq->cpu_wq[cpu];
which costs an extra pointer deref.  Not sure if it's better though.
Alternatively, the !cwq->thread test you're suggesting could be marked
unlikely() so that the multi threaded case which will be used for
performance critical workqueues will be favoured by the compiler.

Sure code clarity is the biggest factor here, but I was thinking we
could cut down the number of dynamic allocations.  My guess is that in
the common case, the workqueue_t is either statically allocated (as in
the case of keventd) or embedded in another struct and allocated as
part of that struct:
        struct hpsb_host {
		char *name;
		/* whatnot */
		workqueue_t wq;
	};
	...
	host = kmalloc(sizeof *host, GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!host)
		goto error:
	host->name = "ohci1394";
	workqueue_init(&host->wq, "ieee1394");
