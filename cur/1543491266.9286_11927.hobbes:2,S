take a look to :
strfind : String ´sys_sched_yield´ found in * Files :
***********  ./arch/alpha/kernel/entry.S
        .quad sys_sched_setparam, sys_sched_getparam,
sys_sched_setscheduler, sys_sched_getscheduler, sys_sched_yield
***********  ./arch/i386/kernel/entry.S
        .long SYMBOL_NAME(sys_sched_yield)
***********  ./arch/m68k/kernel/entry.S
        .long SYMBOL_NAME(sys_sched_yield)
***********  ./arch/ppc/kernel/misc.S
        .long sys_sched_yield
***********  ./kernel/sched.c
asmlinkage int sys_sched_yield(void)
strfind : done !
