The unloading can proceed once module_unload_inhibit_cnt reaches zero.
An unloading thread only has to care about inhibition put in effect
before unloading has started, so there's no need to check again.

* It would serialize users of the sledgehammer.
* It would block loading modules (which is often more important than
unloading them) when things go south.
