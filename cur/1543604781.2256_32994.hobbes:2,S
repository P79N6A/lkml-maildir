No argument here, we need to show compelling performance cases for RCU in
a number of situations.  We have some (e.g., for FD set management on
8-way reported at OLS), but need more.  We will continue to work on this.
If nothing else, this thread seems to have raised awareness of RCU.  ;-)
						Thanx, Paul
