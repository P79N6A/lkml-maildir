No, Sven it is not. I am not so worried about that scenario.
I am worried about some coder somewhere still using local_irq_disable() -
there is a lot of code out there doing that. We have not confirmed that
all of it really locks small enough regions to preserver RT preemption.
I for one is doubtfull about the cmos_lock thingy. (Sorry, can't connect
to my machine at home to check where it is, right now.) A very weird setup
with a kind of homebrewn spinlock.
All these cases needs to be reviewed to see if it is valid to use a
global lock type like local_irq_disable() or a local mutex must be used.
The former is only "allowed" if the time being within the locked is
deterministicly only in the order of the time for scheduling.
I wanted to add a extra name to the namespace stating "this usage of
local_irq_disable() have been reviwed wrt. RT_PREEMPT".
