Well, if you're losing power in the next Xmilliseconds, do you have
the time to seek to the cache holding area and settle down the head
(since you could have done a seek from the edge of the disk to the
middle), start writing, etc?  Seems better to have a cache sized flash
ram instead where you could just keep the data there in case of power
loss.  
But that's expensive, and not something most people need...
