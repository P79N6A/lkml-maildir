OK .. I said I'd do it, so here is the formal change of the maintainer. 
Note that I too only have a limited subset of MCA hardware ... the
voyager systems have a kind of super MCA bus that didn't have any of the
MCA bus limitations in the original IBM spec, so a lot of the MCA HW I
have doesn't work on ordinary MCA busses.  The only standard MCA cards I
have are networking ones.
