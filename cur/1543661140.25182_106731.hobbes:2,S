To be honest I have no idea. I'm not trying to find the filesystem with the 
greatest throughput, but which utilises the least resources while maintaining 
throughput. Perhaps we're looking for different things, but I'm open to any 
suggestions; but they'll have to wait for my waking hours, and for others' 
comments. These benchmarks are run manually for every stage as they are way 
out of the scope of the design of contest and therefore time consuming.
