Jiri - 
I have several hours of running aith nohpet and X's affinity set to 2
instead of 3 and so far everything is running flawlessly.
Even though Mark Hounschell pointed me at this old Suse issue 
(
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=223561
)
which has the same suggestion (taskset) as you made, for me this was
something new starting with 2.6.24-git15 - maybe something made a timing
issue fall a little closer to the edge.  
Would you like me to try and further isolate things for you here by
either running with just nohpet OR just the taskset to change X's
affinity?
Once again thank you for your prompt (and effective) support on this
issue.
Chris
