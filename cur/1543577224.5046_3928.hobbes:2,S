Kernel Version: 2.4.0-test11 - 2.4.0-prerelease
Platform: ix86 (PIII)
Problem Hardware: Kodac DC280, firmware 1.01
Ever since test10 or after, removing my dc280 from the usb
bus causes khubd to crash.  I have tried both UHCI drivers
and they produce the same effect. 
dmesg, syslog, messages, and .config can be found at:
http://mammoth.org/~skulcap/usb-problem
I have looked throug the archives and havent found anything
like this, so I'm sorry if it has been covered already.  
Thanks in advance!
