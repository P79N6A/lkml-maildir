It sounds a bit like a pmtu problem related to the wireless bridge, but 
that would be dependent on amount of data transferred and should not 
happen on 100baseT.
Transport mode (just blowfish encryption) looks to be working ok for me,
I'm able to ftp uncompressed kernel tarballs between two boxes over 
gigabit ethernet with no apparent problems.
