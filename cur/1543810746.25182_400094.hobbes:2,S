Why?

Please don't bother with the space after the #.  Yes, it's for nesting
level, but if someone later comes along and sticks more ifdefs around this
code, they won't go through and add the extra spaces anyway.
Such problems can be avoided by not adding the ifdefs at all..

Can't we use CONFIG_DOUBLEFAULT throughout?  It's very much clearer.

How much more RAM does this patch consume?

"EXCEPTION_STACK_SIZE", please.
