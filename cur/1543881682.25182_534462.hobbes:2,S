It may be wise to disable the selection of ondemand, however, conservative was 
designed to fix the very problem created by ondemand (the need for high 
switching latencies), and this also says nothing about powersave.
Additionally, it seems odd that the kernel would be left in an undefined state 
if a governor failed to initalize - rather, shouldn't the governor fail in such 
a way as to not cause errors?
