that doesn't solve the problem.  i should have mentioned that i
already (unnecessarily, i suggest) ran "make modules_prepare", but the
problem persists.
the issue seems to be that running that last make command to build the
module visor.ko doesn't somehow signal the Makefile that this is a
*module* build, and therefore no module-related initialization is
done, such as creating that directory or setting the Makefile variable
MODVERDIR, etc, etc.
once you've build at least one module successfully, then the directory
.tmp_versions exists so future module builds will work fine.  it's
only when you do a clean, *immediately* followed by trying to do an
in-tree module build, that this is going to bite you.
