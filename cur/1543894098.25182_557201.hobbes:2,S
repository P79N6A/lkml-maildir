Hello,
my Asus M2N Notebook hangs doing the following on 2.6.22-rc3 (from Ubuntu 
Gutsy Gibbon Tribe-1):
Setting up standard PCI resources
The non-scrollable output on the full screen can be found here:

Booting with nolapic helps, but makes the SATAized IDE controller buggy 
(spontaneous timeouts occuring, which do not happen on OpenBSD or Windows XP 
(shiver)).
I'm using the latest BIOS (A208). Now I know it's buggy as hell and I've 
already complained to Asus, but to no avail.
There have been other reports of the problem on Asus notebooks. I've collected 
some links:

I'm willing to provide any needed information (like DSDT table, system 
info, ...) and try out almost anything (I do not have a serial console handy 
though - the system does not have serial). 
Yours,
