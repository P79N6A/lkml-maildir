It's the way its always been done, and the way the tty layer works.
You register a range of ttys that you're going to be driving, and
you own those ttys whether or not you actually have hardware for
them.
You can't say "ok, I have ttyS1 and ttyS3, I'll leave ttyS0 and ttyS2
available for someone else to use" because the tty layer just doesn't
work like that.  It has the notion of a single driver for a range of
non-overlapping ttys.
Yes, it would be nice to get rid of that limitation, but we're in a
stable kernel series and the tty layer doesn't have a maintainer to
do the work...
