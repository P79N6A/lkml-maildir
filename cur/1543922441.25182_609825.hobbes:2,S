Of course. Just because Geode is the only x86 potential user of such an API 
does not mean it should impose its design. Remember that this patch is part 
of a serie to add support for the RDC R-321x SoC, which becomes another 
x86-family user.
Looking at what Geode can do, and what RDC can do, I guess there are only few 
functions that are generic, all the drain, multiplexing, direction things are 
only available on the Geode board.
