I don't think it will really be any more shouty than the convention of
using caps for simple constant #defines.  The Ebony device tree uses
this now, and I think it turns out quite well (though in that case
there's the additional reason to use caps that the labels are based on
the component names used in the 440GP user manual, which are given as
caps).
