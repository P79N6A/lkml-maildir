Oh Pavel, this is more a whinge than a bug report.  You know better ;)
- How much memory does the machine have?
- UP/SMP/preempt?
- What do vmstat and top say?
- Did it happen in 2.5.64?  2.5.63?  2.4.20?
- Does it get better if you renice stuff?
- What steps should others take to reproduce it?
etc, etc, etc.
