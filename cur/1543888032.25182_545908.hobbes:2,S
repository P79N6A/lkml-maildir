BTW, if you have two independently defined bitwise types, sparse
will complain about mixing them, so you still have protection against
mixing unrelated types that happen to have the same endianness.
Folks, just doing annotations of net/* had been large enough and it
mostly had been about annotating declarations.  If we have to rewrite
every sodding place where we happen to do bitwise operations on those...
Forget about it.  BTW, another fun kind of places is comparing for
equality - also adds a fsckload of lines to rewrite^Wobscure.
