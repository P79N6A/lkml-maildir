Minor nit: On the QE, they'll be called ttyQE0 through ttyQE7.
I agree that the CPM and the QE should share the same starting minor number, so that 
ttyCPM0 has the same major/minor number as ttyQE0, since it's not possible to have a CPM 
and a QE on the same device.  However, ttyCPM0 is currently assigned to 46, and device 50 
is an Altix serial card.  The only way to give the CPM 6 or 8 slots without moving it is 
to overlap the Altix card.
Now I don't know anything about the Altix card, so I don't know if it's possible to use 
that card on a system with a CPM or a QE.  If it isn't, then I don't know if overlapping 
minor numbers is still a problem.
(Note that the Altix card has a range of 50-81, which is pretty big.)
If we move CPM/QE to 192, then I can change the CPM device driver to reflect that, but I 
don't know what that means for older kernels.
