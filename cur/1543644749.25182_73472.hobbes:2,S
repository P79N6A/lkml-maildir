The FEC ethernet core has been used by Motorola in both PowerPC parts
(the MPC860) and the ColdFire (5272). But it could be conditional
on either of these.

Easy done :-)

To be honest I don't know why all of these are not always included.
The extra code size is not that significant (tehse rae just PHY 
definitions).
Some history:
I didn't write this driver. It is Dan Malek's driver for the ethernet
core in the PowerPC 860. I took that code and generalizd it for use
on the ColdFire 5272 which also uses the same ethernet core design.
By and large I have tried to leave the original drivers functionalty
"as it was", conditionalizing the 5272 support as required (there are
a few key differences to be dealt with).
I approached Dan in the past about merging the code, and he was not
interrested.

I can't see any use for this...

Yeah, there is a bit of that. All due to trying to handle the
silicon implementation differences on the 860 and 5272.
I'll see if I can clean it up some.

This is on my todo list :-)

Already done. They have just not hit the mailline tree yet.
But David has it in his CVS now.

I'll look at cleaning this up too. This code has been hacked
on by so many people, I am still cleaning the chewy bits of it :-)

mmnommu is probably the most contenious, and effects the most
files. I am still looking at merging the separated mmnommu
directory at the top level back into the mm directory. Just
thinking about the cleanest way to do that.
The m68knommu is purely architecture support, doesn't mess
with anything else in the kernel.
Thanks for the feedback, much appreciated!
Regards
Greg
