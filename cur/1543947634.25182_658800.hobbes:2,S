I know I am probably shooting myself in the foot here, since I am the 
original author of mvsas, but...
Should we be adding new drivers during -rc?
On one hand, it's clear the addition does not break anything, and adds 
value for users.
On the other hand, it's clearly not a bug fix, and -rc could easily get 
bloated with new drivers that didn't make the merge window.
On the net driver side of things, I have a few new net drivers that I 
have queued for 2.6.26, because they did not make the merge window. 
This is inconsistent with your apparently policy.
I would just prefer to have a clear and consistent policy here, 
regarding new drivers during -rc.
Thanks,
