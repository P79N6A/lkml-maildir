AFAIK, XFS by design must provide _file system_ consistency, not data.

Interesting to know, how "another one" FS is quick and stable.
On my new hardware, with dual core CPU 3.4G, 1G of RAM, 1/2TB disk space
(office pro, yes *office* (pro)), `dd' can suck 50M/s, (running and)
extracting 2.6.19-rc2 on fresh 20Gb partition (xfs,jfs) yields nearly 4M/s.
As for ordinary user it seems very slowly.
Ext2 (not ext3) is as fast as shmfs, until RAM will be full.
And after 13 cycles XFS has 11-12 directories with good linux source,
ext2 6-7 (IIRC). On start of 14th cycle i pushed reset button, btw.
Mounting & repairing XFS took less than minute; e2fsck spent more time
on printing, rather than reparing, i think (:.
Want to create another one? OK, but why not to improve existing? >/dev/null
