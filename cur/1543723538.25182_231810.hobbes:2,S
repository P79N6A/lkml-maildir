Sure, I did. That works fine if A is built in the kernel tree (i.e. the 
sources of A stays there), not when both A and B are external modules.
Actually, the problem is a bit different: compiled B know nothing about 
A and doesn't reffer to it, so depmod and friends can't help. Ever if A 
already loaded, B refused to load (can't find the symbols). I suspect, I 
need to add something in the Makefile of A/B/both. But what?
Thanks,
Vlad
