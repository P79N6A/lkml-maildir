Please use CONFIG_MIPS instead of __mips__ in #if / #ifdefs.
The question if #ifdefing is the right approach to solve this problem is
something else but I think no, ....

So this is needed because the MIPS virt_to_page is returning a unsuitable
value if vaddress is not a KSEG0 (64-bit: cached XKPHYS) address which is
what GFP allocations and the slab will return.  So now we have to deciede
if
 a) the MIPS __pa() should be changed to handle uncached addresses.
 b) the sound code here is simply broken.
Some drivers seem to allocate runtime->dma_area from vmalloc, so this
whole area in the sound code is looking like built on quicksand ...

VM_RESERVED will prevent the buffer from being freed.  I assume that is
another workaround for some kernel subsystem blowing up when being fed a
pointer to an uncached RAM address?  This smells like a memory leak.

I would suggest to get rid of this ifdef with a new arch-specific function
like vmap_io_buffer which will do whatever a platform seems fit for this
case?
