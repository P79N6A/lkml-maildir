I didn't want to code the whole application here, hope you understand ;)

Indeed. Hangup cases are a small fraction of std ones, so it has no sense
to optimize for them trying to avoid at all the read. And the name
READONCE seems to imply that you can't read(2) twice. I'd rather prefer
the RDHUP flag that tells me : There's an hungup condition for sure, and
you might also find some data since POLLIN is set.
