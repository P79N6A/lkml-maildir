That is a nice theory, and I think that this could be true in the
past, but in 2.4.2X, PF_MEMDIE only appears in the two places that I
show, and it is completely redundant, look at the patch, we are just 
|-ing both PF_MEMALLOC and PF_MEMDIE and later we are &-ing against
the or of the two.  Use find & grep yourself if you don't believe me.
Later, Juan.
