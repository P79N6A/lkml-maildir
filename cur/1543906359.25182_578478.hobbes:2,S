Yes, your telephone number persists even if you plug it into another
jack (well, at least for my ISDN box, this holds true). Your names
did persist - no card uses eth0 (which seems to belong to another one
that is not currently installed). Note also that not the names per se
are persistent, the (name,device) tuples are.
