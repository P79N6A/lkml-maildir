hallo,
after searching the mailing list and searching the web, I still don't
know how to access correctly the serial port (in user space known as
/dev/ttyS01)
This thread ends before the answer was given and the site redirecting
too is restructured: 
http://marc.info/?l=kernelnewbies&m=98314502419089&w=2
would somebody be so kind to give me an example:
with this behaviour:
1. read from port
2. output via printk()
3. write to port
I'm learning how to write modules:
I've created already my own char-dev and used it in user-space.
However I don't know really how to get information from kernel-code to
solve this.
thx in advance
