> We are evaluating the CFS OLTP performance with 2.6.28-c7 kernel. In this workload once a database foreground process commit a transaction it will signal the log writer process to write to the log file. Foreground processes will wait until log writer finish writing and wake them up. With hundreds of foreground process running in the system, it is important that the log writer get to run as soon as data is available.

Maybe you should try an RT kernel.
