This is more or less identical to the patch I've posted a few times 
(last time under the subject '[PATCH] binfmt_elf; do proper error 
handling if clear_user fails in padzero') and it looks sane to me.
Last time I heard anything about this Andrew said he had that patch (and 
a few related) on his todo list.
Anyway, I'll sign off on this one.
