Actually, I only know a bit of python.  It seems nice but I've been
caught up doing real work (and learning PPC asm at the same time.)

Well I know python is endian-clean.  I'd suspect it's even 32/64bit clean.
So it's not a matter of 'port' but compile.  And Linus has done things which
have made lots of kernel hackers scratch their head for a while.  (Jump
out of this fire and into the min/max macros in 2.4.9 fire to see
what I mean).
