Do you have by chance any netfilter modules loaded? 
I've seen sig-11 on gcc here when the netfilter-NAT-modules are loaded,
but I haven't investigated this further, yet.
Without them everything seems fine.
This is an alpha-noname System, kernels 2.3.30pre3 and up.
(can't test kernels from .11 to .30 - they have other problems here)
