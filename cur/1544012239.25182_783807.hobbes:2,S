| if ns == 0, "p" won't see the signal anyway, so all we need is
Yes, p won't see the signal, but task_tgid_nr_ns() is not safe if ns == NULL.
We should either check ns or make task_tgid_nr_ns() and friends safe with
ns == NULL ?

Yes, I had a question about ns == 0 in this patch and was wondering if I
should add a check in __do_notify() too.

SI_FROMUSER() basically comes down to SI_USER and SI_TKILL (SI_QUEUE,
SI_SIGIO, SI_DETHREAD are unused ?)  SI_USER has to be masqueraded in
send_signal(). That leaves us with SI_TKILL. 
I was trying to have all si_pid settings done at origin and so the change
here for SI_TKILL. But yes, SI_USER (sys_kill() case) can't be done at
origin hence the special case for it in send_signal().

| 		if (!from_ancestot_ns)
| 			info.si_pid = task_tgid_nr_ns(current, ...);
| 
| ?
My preference was to address SI_TKILL also at origin, but am not
particular.  Yes, that will work too.
| 
| Yes, we use "current". But we already used it in siginfo_from_ancestor_ns().
