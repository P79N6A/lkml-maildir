For what it's worth (maybe not much) I have a Vaio U101 which uses the
"Celeron 600A" processor. This is a sort of bastard-child of the Pentium M
family -- it's not listed on their web site anywhere that I know of --
certainly not in the pdf documents -- and it doesn't have any SpeedStep
ability at all. (It's apparently locked 600Mhz and the lowest voltage. I
have't tried your patch to see what happens -- I can if you want.) Anyway, I
mention it because it *does* report itself as Family 6, Model 9, Stepping 5.
Model name is "Mobile Intel(R) Celeron(R) processor 600MHz".
