'serializing' instructions are the ones that are barriers to all
speculative CPU mechanizms. Intel LOCK-ed instructions are preventing the
most important asynchron mechanism from occuring: speculative reads. They
do not prevent certain other mechanizm like TLB prefetch or icache
prefetch, but this is of little practical interest.
basically we need no serializing instructions at all, because Intel
guarantees the 'Program Order' shared memory model, which makes
serializing instructions (in the classical sense) meaningless. (they would
be much more important if the memory model was weakly ordered). But even
preventing TLB-prefetches can be important in some cases, eg. when we are
modifying page tables.

fully serializing instructions are: NVD, INVPG, WBINVD, IRET, IRETD, LGDT,
LLDT, LIDT, LTR, CPUID, RSM.

no, but in the WC memory model they are a write barrier. [otherwise every
write is a write barrier]

only IRET. Also i believe task switches are serializing because they have
an implicit LTR.

once they do SMP we'll see.
