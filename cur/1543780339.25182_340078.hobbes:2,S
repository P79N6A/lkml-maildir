Unfortunately it made the wrong choice with pselect, as Linux select
experience has shown the modified timeout is *very* useful data to some
applications. So the patch is better than the POSUX behaviour. The
library can wrap it to provide the poorer standards compliant API while
not stopping people using the better one for Linux specific apps.
