Hermann,
The bugfixes that I am concerned about do not include the refactoring 
changes from Andrew -- those are not even bugfixes at all, and they are 
only accessible through our mercurial tree.  We do not plan to send 
those upstream until 2.6.18  -- This has nothing at all to do with 
Mauro's latest git-pull-request, or my email to Linus.

I'm not sure what you mean.  Sure, we do have some drastic changes 
coming up for 2.6.18 ...  but this email is about bugfixes that HAVE in 
fact been thoroughly tested.
It sounds to me as if you may be getting the pending changesets in 
Mauro's git tree confused with current changes in our mercurial 
development repository.
Just take a look at v4l-dvb.git ...   (or at the diffstat earlier in 
this thread) ..  You will find that the drastic changes that you have 
mentioned aren't there yet.  Those do need some more testing before 
being sent upstream... I think they'll be ready in time for the 2.6.18 
merge window, but this is not the issue right now.
Thanks for your concern,
Michael Krufky
