actually, that is an interesting philosophical argument.
in an embedded system, it is sometimes more useful to not put artificial 
constraints on the system and allow the clock and timer system to work in hw 
increments, but document the hell out of it.
this is the "give 'em enough rope to hang themselves, but tell them the 
precise length of the rope" model.
in an embedded system a "tickless" system is sometimes preferable to a ticked 
system.  there is often only one or a very small number of processes/threads 
running and the extra overhead of 10 surplus clock ticks per process quantum 
is a waste of cycles. (also when using a ppc or similar modern chip(flame 
on;-), there is no need to keep a software wall clock, as the cpu has a 64bit 
free running counter)  
I had this discussion with george A. early in the posix timers project and I 
argued/begged for a compile time config option giving the option of ticked 
and tickless versions.  George chose to go with a ticked system, because it 
benchmarked better in a general purpose system, particlularly under high 
loads, and he didn't have time to implement two systems.   he made the right 
choice for the general purpose kernel and for probably 80% of the embedded 
market. (I'm in the other 20%)
