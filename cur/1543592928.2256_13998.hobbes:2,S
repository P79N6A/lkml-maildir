I use the 'pgt_offset', 'pmd_offset', 'pte_offset' and 'pte_page' inside a
module to get the physical address of a user space virtual address. The
physical address returned by 'pte_page' is not page aligned whereas the
virtual address was page aligned. Can somebody tell me the reason?
Also, can i use these functions to get the physical address of a kernel
virtual address using init_mm?
regards,
Daljeet.
