I thought that last page was intentionally left invalid?
So that, for example, *(char *)MAP_FAILED will give SIGSEGV;
whereas now I can read a 0 there (and perhaps you should be
using get_zeroed_page rather than __get_free_page?).
I cannot name anything which relies on that page being invalid,
but think it would be safer to keep that it way; though I guess
more compatibility pain to use the next page down (or could
seg lim be used? I forget the granularity restrictions).
