Good point. In fact, it doesn't need to be a malloc() - I remember people 
doing this with Fortran programs and just having an absolutely incredibly 
big BSS (with traditional Fortran, dymic memory allocations are just not 
done).

Sure you do. If glibc used mmap() or brk(), it *knows* the new data is 
zero. So if you use calloc(), for example, it's entirely possible that 
a good libc wouldn't waste time zeroing it.
The same is true of BSS. You never clear the BSS with a memset, you just 
know it starts out zeroed.
