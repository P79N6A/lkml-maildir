   I would like to point who ever is in charge of the TCP stack for
   the linux kernel at a site which claims to have a method of
   eliminate denial of service (DoS) attacks
   
http://grc.com/r&d/nomoredos.htm
   With my limited unstanding of TCP and DoS attacks this would seem
   to be the answer, instead of a work around.
These people claim that no connection state needs to be saved for the
beginning of the negotiation, and I claim this is unworkable because
it ignores TCP timestamps entirely.
Furthermore, it also cannot work because it makes retransmissions
of the SYN/ACK very non-workable.  I suppose his TCP stack just hacks
around this by just waiting for the original client SYN to get
retransmitted or something like this.  I question whether that can
even work reliably.
I think not holding onto any state for an incoming SYN is nothing but
a dream in any serious modern TCP implementation.  It can be reduced,
but not eliminated.  The former is what most modern stacks have done
to fight these problems.
Later,
