Out of curiosity, is there still the intention of implementing 
the ability to place capabilities (i.e. privs) on files in ext3?
or ext2 for that matter? 
I suppose the capabilities people are well versed in how the 
Secureware (Digital MLS+, HP-UX CMW, SCO CMW) and the Trusted
Solaris operating systems handle privs? 
My co-workers and I have a large base of knowlege about B1+ and
CMW type systems.  And we're also really interested in seeing Linux 
pick up an implementation of the principle of least privilege  
(no more nasty setuid programs!).  So if we can offer any assistance
just let me know.
