Yes it saved me. It work now. Why no other sane
documentation said like yours? I think people at sane
project should take your point to add to their
documentation.

I dont use rpm based system, I use my own built linux
system half based on slackware 9.0 so your information
is really helpful. Before I got stuck. Run
sane-find-scanner, it said find usb scanner, but when
run scanimage -L it always tell me only bttv device
available!. Even I feed it with --device
libusb:XXX:XXX (from sane-find-scanner output) and it
still refuses, Invalid argument message. Hm until
now...
Thank you again.
