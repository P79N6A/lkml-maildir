Continuing the promotion of binary-only drivers _hurts_ the demand for
(and thus the development of) open source drivers.  Read the comment from
Dave as something like "Nobody who matters, with regard to kernel
development, cares about NDISwrapper".   If _you_ care, fork your own tree
and maintain the patch as necessary.
