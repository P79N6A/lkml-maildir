Hi Marcelo!
(Sorry for crossposting, but contact adresses in driver
documentation and MAINTAINERS file look a little bit
outdated and I wanted the right persons to receive this
mail. Methinks the maintainer infos could use some update,
too... :-)
The Asus Pundit-R is a nice barebone system useful to
build small and compact desktop workstations. It uses
an Asus P4R8L motherboard which has an ATI chipsed on
board.

With a standard Linux 2.4.x kernel (tested with x >= 26),
every hardware component(*) works fine, except the built-in
ethernet controller.
As you can see, lspci tells us that this is an 3Com 3c920
integrated NIC. The standard 3c59x driver does not recognise
this piece of hardware. But with a small patch applied, it does,
and the network interface driver works without problems!

I have tested this patch on three different Pundit-R
barebones with a few different kernels for several weeks now.
I started with linux-2.4.26 and have now 2.4.28pre3 running.
It seems to work well with no ill sideffects. I have not
tested all possible driver options, though.
Note: This patch was not created originally be me, but I do
not remember where I got it from in the first place. As it
works well for me I would like to submit it for inclusion
in the next kernel release.
Please take a look at the patch and consider including it
in the next 2.4 kernel. Thank you.

(*) I did not have the time to test the memory card reader,
so I can't say if it works ;-)
