The LCD class device bits look fine to me. The only change I'd request
is not to change the order of things in drivers/video/backlight/Kconfig.
If you do want to reword one of those entries (which is what I think you
wanted to do), send it as a separate patch please.
David, any objections to the SPI bits?
