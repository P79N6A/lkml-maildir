Andi, it's been simpler for us to get the code into Andrew's tree, in
nice bit-size pieces.  We've had trouble every time we've tried to get
stuff into your tree.  In addition, Andrew's tree gives the code
exposure and testing.
If Andrew says we have to get those patches into mainline through you,
then I'll spend all that time re-spinning the patches for you from the
-mm tree until they go in.  It doesn't seem like a good use of anyone's
time though.
Rusty.
