Well, I don't know what to do - the device I have is reported as
revision 0113.  But the patch on 
http://martin.wilck.bei.t-online.de/
has a range of 0x0000 - 0x0015 so it would not handle my device.

He is on the Cc: list.  Please consider this entry, possibly with
US_FL_START_STOP and US_FL_MODE_XLATE flags added (no difference
for me, but present in the patch on the above mentioned page), for
inclusion in 2.4.20.  I can make a patch if you tell me what range
and flags would be accepted.
Support for such devices out of the box becomes more important now
that motherboard BIOSes start supporting boot from USB storage
(so you could easily install a Linux distribution on a CF card,
or use one as a rescue disk simply plugged into an USB port if ever
needed - no need for a floppy or CD-ROM drive in a server).
I don't know how widespread this is, but such a feature has just
appeared in the latest MSI MS-6368 BIOS upgrade, for example...
Thanks,
Marek
