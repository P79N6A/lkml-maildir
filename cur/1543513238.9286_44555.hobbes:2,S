I understand this. Please, understand me correctly too: you can improve
this patch so that it will be valid, but you have no reasons to make
this task in kernel.
All such simple tasks are summed and, if we will put all of them to kernel,
we will get full mess very soon. You have already moved in wrong direction
adding AX.25 address printer...

Well, then improve it! Use PF_PACKET, LSF. They were made exaclty
to avoid making in kernel simple tasks, which can be made in user space.
And if you wrote X reporter, it would be just great achievement.
