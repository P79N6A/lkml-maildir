hey, my brother just tried to install 2.6.7-mm2 on his computer, its a
amd64 3200+ with a asus k8v deluxe motherboard.
the thing that happens is, that stuff simply lags, the cpu is not being
heavily used, but when typing in the console, it gets strange, and types
like 1 character per second. booting in vmware and it works perfect.
then he tried 2.6.7 vanilla, the same result, and finally, he tried
2.6.6vanilla, and its also the same result.
2.6.2 worked fine.
hope you have some ideas.
