Please back up your assertions with code. If you can implement
a non-overcommit option which doesn't put overhead in the normal
kernel, I'm sure people will use it.
The IRIX vswap argument isn't a really valid one either.
Almost all IRIX admins I've talked to had their vswap at
either zero or infinity because otherwise behaviour would
be too difficult to predict ... exactly the opposite of
what you are saying here.

Rik
