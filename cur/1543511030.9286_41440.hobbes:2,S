Simce when was having to do extra, unnecessary
work a good thing. Remember that Linus himself
uses a distribution. I can't believe you're mad
enough to roll your own distribution just so
you'd learn more.
Computers are tools, if they're not "working"
then they're an expensive room heater.

There's a difference between being able to
do something and wanting to. AND, to deny
the advantages of linux to the general
population would be a crime.
