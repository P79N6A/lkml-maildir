(The patch to remove the limit is referenced at

)
Has sufficient time now passed for this patch to be reconsidered?
If not, would an acceptable compromise be to allow runtime configuration
for this limit (e.g. via sysctl)? This would preserve backwards compatibility,
but allow folk to choose their own arbitrary limits.
