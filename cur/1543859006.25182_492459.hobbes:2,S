I'm using rtorrent-0.7.0 and libtorrent-0.11.0, just download a torrent
with multiple files(I downloaded 84 rar files) and when it will finish
it will do a hash check and at the end of the check will say "Hash check
on download completion found bad chunks, consider using "safe_sync"."
and stop and most of the downloaded files are broken. With Peter
Zijlstra patch this error doesn't show but there is file
corruption(although less files are corrupted); afther the hash check,
rtorrent will download the bad chunks and do another hash check and all
files are ok.
