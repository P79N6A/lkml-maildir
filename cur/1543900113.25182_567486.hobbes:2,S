This is an update to iproute2 utilities including bug fixes and features
related to 2.6.22 kernel.
This package tries to be source compatible across releases.
The same source should build on older systems, but obviously the
newer kernel features won't be available.
It can be downloaded from:
  
http://developer.osdl.org/dev/iproute2/download/iproute2-2.6.22-070710.tar.gz
