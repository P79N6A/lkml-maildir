man setrlimit (or ulimit)
This is per user though, and only related
to user accounting really as you can only
set a limit on the number of CPU seconds
used.
I would also really like the ability
to throttle any processes back to a certain
% of CPU, and extending this to throttling
users to certain CPU limits which would be
useful also.
Obviously you would set it up so that all
available CPU is used, for e.g. if you
had 2 CPU bound processes running and you
allocated 1 to 40% and the other 60%, when
either terminates the other should increase
to the available CPU (I can't see any reason
why you would forceably limit a process' CPU
usage if there was free CPU).
Could the current scheduling logic that uses
the nice value of a process, do this, and all
I would have to do is have a % specifying wrapper
around this?
Any other ideas or will I get hacking..
