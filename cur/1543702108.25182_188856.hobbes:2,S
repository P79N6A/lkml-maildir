reiserfs_write_unlock(inode->i_sb); is called at the beginning of the
function, and as far as I can tell it's matched by a call to
reiserfs_write_unlock(inode->i_sb); at every potential return point in the
function, and I see no other locks being taken.
Besides, since  if (block < 0)  will never be true and
	reiserfs_write_unlock(inode->i_sb);
	return -EIO;
will never execute in any case, locking should behave identical to what it
did before removing the code.
Locking /seems/ OK to me in this function.
Also, I did a build of fs/reiserfs/ both with and without the above patch,
and then did a disassemble of inode.o (objdump -d) and compared the
generated code for reiserfs_get_block , and the generated code is
byte-for-byte identical in both cases, which means that gcc realizes that
the if() statement will never execute and optimizes it away in any case.
This is a further indication that removing the code should be safe.
And it seems to me that any code that assumes that a sector_t value can be
negative is either broken or obsolete.

I'm not familliar with those "sector_t merges" you are refering to, but I
found some mention of a 64bit sector_t merge in the 2.5.x kernel
Changelogs, so I downloaded the 2.5.10 kernel source (first reference to
sector_t I found was in the 2.5.11 changelog) and took a look at how
sector_t used to be defined. It seems that it was an unsigned value even
back then.
Has sector_t ever been signed?
