That's interesting.  I've always found that Best UPSs were more expensive
than equivalent APC UPSs.  APC's Tech Support was very nice in attitude.
They didn't support Linux directly, it's true, but they guy did give me

I've had my SmartUPS Net-700 for over 2 years without any problems.
Saved me many a power outage.

I tend to put more stock in to the Tech Support people. They're the ones
who really need to be Linux savy.
