I finally spotted and fixed the silly bug. Here it is the fix against 2.3.8:

 	block -= (1 << (addr_per_block_bits * 2));
 	i = inode_bmap (inode, EXT2_TIND_BLOCK);
BTW, I also fixed all my local-VM (not related to the real 2.3.8) bugs so
now my 2.3.8-tree "seem" rock solid (no problem with _heavy_ swap+I/O in
progress).
Now I hope you'll agree to soon merge my pagemap-lru code into the kernel :)).
