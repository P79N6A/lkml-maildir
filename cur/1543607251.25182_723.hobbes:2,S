e2defrag has a setting to allocate buffers.  According to the number i gave 
it, it should have allocated 128MB .. this is in accordance to what i 
observed in ps aux during the runtime.   All vmstat data i had was in buffer 
and lost when later i ran the graphviz programs and deadlocked the computer.  
I was not expecting to reboot.  I can always try it again.  e2defrag didn't 
deadlock the computer, but it did cause that unusual behavior that i observed 
just before deadlocking it with graphviz.   What kind of vmstat output do you 
want,   every 10 seconds?
