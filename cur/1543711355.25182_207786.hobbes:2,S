It would work. However, the driver would then have to "know"
if the interrupt came from IO-APIC or from the 8259. It also
would have to "know" what IRQ it was actually using, etc.,
not just at configuration time, but forever. So, all the
dirty details were put in the kernel code so that the
ISR only needs to know it was called as a result of an
interrupt.
There is no problem with masking ON/OFF the interrupt
input to the 8259, In fact, this can be used to generate
another (unreliable) edge if the IRQ line is still asserted.
The IRQ7 spurious is usually an artifact of a crappy motherboard
design where the CPU "thinks" it was interrupted, but the
controller didn't wiggle the CPUs INT line. Once the INT
cycle starts, it must complete or the CPU would hang forever
waiting for the vector. Therefore, if the controller gets
the vector request from the CPU and it didn't actually interrupt,
the controller puts the IRQ7 vector on the bus, that ISR gets
called, and you get a "spurious interrupt". If you are
looking at the programming of the 8259, you are looking in
the wrong place. You need to look at the hardware timing on
the motherboard. That's where the problem originates. The
8259 is just doing its job, keeping the CPU running after
this spurious event.
FYI, the motherboards in the cheapie Dell machines we have
been getting (Optiplex GX260) are attrocious in this respect.
To prevent the error logs from getting filled up with
the "Spurious interrupt" messages, they need to be commented
out in kernels that run on these machines. Otherwise, we
get such messages about 50 or 60 times per hour. I note
that the original question came from somebody at Dell. They
really need to check their own back-yard before investigating
software.
