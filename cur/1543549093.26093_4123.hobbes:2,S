Yes this can be done, but it will affect where requests are inserted.
Suppose the queue currently contains:
	100 200 300 400 10 20 30
If request 150 is to be inserted, then with my previous patch it will
be inserted between 100 and 200, but with the proposed change it will
instead be inserted at the end. This is good for latency because there
will be less reordering, but potentially harmfull for streaming
performance because the total disk head traveling distance increases.
Anyway, I tested a new patch with your suggestion, and indeed this
change doesn't seem to cause too many extra seeks. I set the r/w
latencies to 1000/5000, and the iozone and Bonnie test produced almost
the same values as before.
I also noted that I could (almost) play an mp3 file with a 48Kb
buffer during "cp /dev/zero tmpfile". There is one rather large
skip a few seconds after the copy starts, but after that there are
only small occasional skips. I also ran iozone while playing the mp3,
and there were no major sound skips, and iozone only ran 7% slower
than without mpg123 running.
Thanks again for you comments. Here is the new patch:
