We used to use flush_icache_page() on ppc/ppc64 to ensure that the
i-cache was consistent with the d-cache and with memory.  It was
needed in do_no_page for the case where the page had just been read in
and the i-cache could have stale data reflecting the previous contents
of the page (the i-cache doesn't snoop on ppc).  But we now do that in
update_mmu_cache.
