In your case, I'd check your milo version.  I had the same symptoms until
upgrading to the newest milo version (2.2-17).  I believe it's because of
the changes to the kernel's start address.  Newer test kernels have a way
to enable the old start address (in case your milo doesn't read the ELF
headers to determine the kernel's start address).

I've seen this one mentioned on the list before, but don't recall the
solution (sorry).
FWIW, I'm on a 164SX (w/AlphaBIOS), so YMMV.
