These numbers are useless.  Since a change in frame pointer setup changes 
the code sequences in the text section, it is likely to also change 
maximum acheived compression.  Therefore, the size of the compressed 
images can not be compared and result in any useable data, you need to 
compare the size of the uncompressed images.
