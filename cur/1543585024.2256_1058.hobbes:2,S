Subject: task switch hook - crashes

I am experimenting with adding a few hooks to the kernel.
One of the hooks gets invoked every time the kernel switches
two tasks. To do this I added a single line to schedule() right
before the tasks are switched:
      ...
      if (task_switch_hook) task_switch_hook(prev, next)
      switch_to(prev, next, prev);
      ...
I then wrote a module that attaches a function to this hook
in its init_module() function. The problem is that if I do this,
the kernel crashes. Sometimes, the hooks are invoked a few times,
other times, the machine locks up immediately. I previous version
that compiled everything into the kernel worked fine.
I don't quite understand why this does not work. Is this due
to some virtual memory interactions? Maybe the problem is that
modules are vmalloc-ed and the hook function should be kmalloc-ed?
Any insights?
Thanks, -- Kris
