Subject: [PATCH] Update comments in cpuset.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Update comments in cpuset.c
Some of the comments in kernel/cpuset.c were stale following the
transition to control groups; this patch updates them to more closely
match reality.

- * A cpuset can only be deleted if both its 'count' of using tasks

- * noted below, when dereferencing or, as in attach_task(), modifying
- * a tasks cpuset pointer we use task_lock(), which acts on a spinlock
- * (task->alloc_lock) already in the task_struct routinely used for
