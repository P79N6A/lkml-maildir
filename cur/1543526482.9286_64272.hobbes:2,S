If a socket is closed by the other end then it goes EOF for read once all
the data has been read. This is a portable property of sockets, its true
of BSD and its defined by posix 1003.1g drafts. So you do
	if(FD_ISSET(fd, &read_mask))
	{
		int len=read(fd, buffer, bufsize);
		if(len==0)
		{
			/* EOF - closed */
		}
		if(len<0)
		{
			if(errno==EAGAIN)
			{
				/* woken by something else */
				/* Not needed in theory but is for porting */
			}
			else
			{
				/* it broke */
			}
		}
	}
