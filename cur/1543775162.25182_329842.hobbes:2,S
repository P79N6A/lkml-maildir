Subject: Patch to disarm timers after an exec syscall

Hi all,
while running the openposix testsuite I saw testcase timer_create/9-1.c 
failing. This testcase tests whether timers are disarmed when a process calls 
exec, as described in e.g. 
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/timer_create.html.
The attached one-liner patch (+ one line comment) fixes this issue. I did the 
diff against 2.6.12.1, but the fix is pretty much the same for every other 
2.6.x kernel I had a look at.
I don't think this patch breaks anything, as relying on this (undocumented) 
behaviour would imho be bad style.
So tell me what you think, and if you have some pointers to interesting 
discussions about Linux and POSIX compliance then I would like to read that 
as well.
