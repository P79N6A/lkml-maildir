I found slight changes to arch specific files, but IMHO this should not be
the problem. But AFAIR, benh's ppc patches are somewhat complete and may
introduce conflicts.
BTW, for Nick, the patch didn't compile, I had to change sched_clock()
definition from unsigned long long to unsigned long in
arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_tsc.c. Don't know if it was the right thing to
do, but it compiles and boots.
Cheers,
Willy
