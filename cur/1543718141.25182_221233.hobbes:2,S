Could you clarify that a bit? Why is this correct behaviour on 2.6.6 and 
not 2.6.3? Actually, if there's no adaptor I wouldn't think the module 
would be loaded, and if there is I would hope it would be configured 
usefully.
I do understand why loading would cause problems, my question is why 
loading is correct on this system, and why ACPI is doing so now and not 
in 2.6.3.
