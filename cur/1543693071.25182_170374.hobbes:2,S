I'm sorry for the patch. The problem I had with e1000 compiled into the
kernel was that the interface resets every 60(?) seconds, and there was
no network connection. After a google search I came onto the intel
support page, saw the module-only text, tried e1000 as a module and it
worked. This all is with the e1000 driver which is in the 2.6.0-test6
kernel, which I thought was the intel provided driver.
The server is co-located now, so I'm sorry to say that I can't try
again to give more details.

Aha, tnx. Can you please provide a patch to get this text in the 2.6
help?
