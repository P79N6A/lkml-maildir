So far as I can tell, nobody's trying to do much with that metadata.
Maybe in part because it's not easily accessible.  But that's exactly
something I'd expect the 2.5 build/configure system to start fixing.
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE support is actually a good example.
Its format isn't quite tool-friendly, but the real issue is that such data
is only available _after_ a build!  In this case it's needed before
config.  And if viewed as metadata, it's also incomplete:
    - Drivers omitted from the current config are not listed.
    - It's discarded for statically linked drivers (affects hotplug)
    - Doesn't say what CONFIG_ flag corresponds to each driver
    - No driver-to-docs linkage
    - ...
For anyone configuring a kernel who's not already an expert (we're
not talking Aunt Tillie ... most technical folk shouldn't be kernel experts),
that information can be important.
(One example:  driver docs.  I did some XSLT hacks a while
back, available off the linux-hotplug "links" page.  They do a better
job for USB than PCI.  Sample output (very old now :) is at
http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/kernel/kernel.html
The early text is boilerplate explanation, but sections 3 and 4 are
generated automagically from modutils output, as driven by the
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE info.  I think such info should be far
more accessible than it is.)

Absolutely!  What I think is needed in this case is automatic tools to
generate such stuff from kernel sources, without needing to build the
whole thing.  Run once before "configure me a kernel", to build the
driver database.
And, maybe more in the "I have a dream ..." category, take this rare
opportunity (2.5 cycle reworking build/config) to take a look at the
forest rather than the trees.  Useful tools and documents will come
from making this metadata more generally accessible.
