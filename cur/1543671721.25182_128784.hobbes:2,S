And where do you think taxes come from? Somebody pays for everything; 
there's no such thing as a free lunch.

Certainly, free software does some of these thing; it varies greatly 
from individual to indvidual, but we all contribute time, code, and 
knowledge. Sadly, society tends to measure contributions in dollars and 
cents, given that we need those dollars and cents to feed, clothe, and 
house ourselves.

I couldn't agree more.

Once again, I agree. My original article was in response to statements 
about commercial developers; indeed, the issue cuts both ways.

Damned right.

That's why I'm here. I don't know about other people's motivations, but 
my involvement in free software stems from a recognition of its potential.
But just because free software *is* right doesn't mean it will succeed 
in the long run... we need to be very certain of our motivations and 
actions.
