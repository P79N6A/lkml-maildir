In the case of bleeding edge Fedora, (Ie FC3 t1 right now), 1 and 2 are
the same. Ie, we rebase to the upstream -bk release almost daily.
(The only time we don't is when both myself and Arjan are otherwise
 occupied, like recently at OLS etc, but it's rare that both of us
 are too busy to do a rebase).
The current release version of Fedora (Ie, FC2 right now) has a slightly
less aggressive update cycle, typically only when either a) the upstream
kernel has fixed a lot of bugs that have been biting users, or b) there's
a security problem to justify another update.
