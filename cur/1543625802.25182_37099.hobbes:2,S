In general, we don't automatically clean out old repositories here though
I suspect that will have to change as usage levels rise.  We are going to
start insisting that we get a valid email address when you create a project
on bkbits.net so we can send you mail to ask if you care about something
we want to clean up.
If you created stuff on bkbits.net that you no longer use/need, please log
in as your_proj.adm and do a rm_proj on it.
