Right you are, looks like a bug.  I'm digging into it.  I suspect I have
an off by one delta error but I'm not sure.  Please be aware that it 
takes 4.5 hours of CPU on our fastest machine to do the conversion so 
fixed trees are probably due tomorrow.
If you want to help, see if you can find a pattern the user names, being
aware that the revision numbers don't map one to one.  
Thanks for pointing this out, this was what I wanted.
