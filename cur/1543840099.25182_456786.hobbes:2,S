I think you miseed a '?'
bool b = (i & 1) ? : 0;

No casting needed (in fact, casting is more evil than !!). If bool is a
bool, then the compiler will (hopefully) ensure that b will only get
values valid for bools.
$ cat x.c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, const char **argv) {
    _Bool b = argc;
    printf("%d\n", (int)b);
    return 0;
}
$ ./a.out
