Hi
I am experiencing a very similar problem with a dual 933mhz Hp Netserver with 
a Serverworks Motherboard.
I only have 1.2gig of RAM so I use the 4GIG mem option, the server crashed 
yesterday after two weeks of uptime with the error BUG at Highmem.c :155 .  
It is running Kernel 2.4.3.... as per my other post...
I have seen this problem come up a number of times with as yet no solution. I 
initially found a large amount of memory (/etc/slabinfo) used by icache and 
dcache entries.  As a result a patch was released to fix this but the problem 
remains... random freezes for a number of seconds while editing a file, 
viewing a directory, etc.. ?? HELP
