No. Under BK, you had DIFFERENT TREES.
What does that mean? They had DIFFERENT NAMES.
Which meant that the commit message was MEANINGFUL.

Yes, because _my_ pull script is meant to work with the way _I_ have told 
people (including you) they should work.
The fact that you mush everything up in one tree _despite_ me having told 
you that isn't a good thing to do is the problem.
Git can technically do it, but then you shouldn't use my scripts, which 
aren't written for that behaviour.

You don't use it, you MIS-use it. Which is what I'm complaining about.

No, I pulled exactly from the head you mentioned.
In fact, go look at YOUR OWN changelog. And then compare that changelog to 
the changelog you had when you used BK, and realize that IT IS NOT AT ALL 
EQUIVALENT. You used to have valid changelogs, even for the merge heads. 
You don't any more:
	Automatic merge of /spare/repo/netdev-2.6/.git
	Automatic merge of /spare/repo/netdev-2.6/.git
	Automatic merge of /spare/repo/netdev-2.6/.git
	Automatic merge of /spare/repo/netdev-2.6/.git
	Merge of /spare/repo/netdev-2.6/.git
See a pattern?
Your BK usage was equivalent to having multiple GIT repositories.
