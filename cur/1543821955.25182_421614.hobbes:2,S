hm, OK, I'm not sure that Linux buffered file contents in that manner in
that timeframe.  Maybe it did, before my time..

Yeah, it shouldn't be needed now.  It'd be a howler of a bug if it is
needed.
Note that the pagefault handlers do still do a second readpage().  The
comment implies that this is an open-coded attempt to recover from an I/O
error.  I do recall that a year or so ago we discussed taking out that
second readpage attempt, but Linus had good-sounding reasons for keeping
it.  But I forget what they were.  Perhaps he can remind me?
