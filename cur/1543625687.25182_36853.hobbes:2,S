Ugh, not pretty.
Associate it with the bus position I'd say?
If we want a statically allocated array, create one of size N such that
N is reasonably sane.  Then we can "hash" the bus position onto N ...
something that basically maps the slot number onto N, slot number % N
will do.  Dealing with collisions would be easy, but there really
shouldn't be any in a sane configuration.
Ideally we'd have a dynamically created array for the cards and hash
into that, but, ugh, this is getting gross especially since 99% of us
have one card and never remove it.
