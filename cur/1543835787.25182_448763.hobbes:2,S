It sounds to me as a BIOS issue. From the boot log, it is quite clear that
TSCs are running at different speeds(different bogomips show this).
This CPU stepping has constant TSC behavior. So this is most probably happening
because of bios setting different core to bus clock ratios for each package.
Different CPU speed BIOS issue that you mention also points to this.
Can you check if your BIOS settings are set to max ratio(15?) available?
or try an updated BIOS?

Perhaps data overflow(because of unsync TSC's) in timer code calculations
may be causing this?
