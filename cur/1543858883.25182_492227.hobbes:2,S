Can you see if the kernel state at commit 77d172ce ("[PATCH] fix SG_IO bio 
leak") is good? Ie just do something like
	git checkout -b test-branch 77d172ce
and compile and test that?
That commit _should_ be the one that fixed whatever problems that commit 
0e75f906 introduced. It *did* fix it for other - somewhat similar - 
situations.
That said: Jens - I think 0e75f906 was a mistake. "blk_rq_unmap()" really 
should be passed the "struct bio", not the "struct request *". Right now 
it does something _really_ strange with requests with linked bio's, and I 
don't think your and FUJITA's "leak fix" really works. What happens when 
the bio was a linked list on the request, and you put the old _head_ on 
the request with "rq->bio = bio"? What happens to the other parts of it?
IOW, I think this is broken. I think we should revert 0e75f906. Or at 
least you should explain to me why it's not broken, and why clearly people 
(eg Alistair) still see problems with it?
