Oh.  So they are infringing already, and just trying to hide it?
This is so common that it applies to most drivers? :-(

Closed source may lock customers out, not in.  I don't see how an
open source driver makes it easier for the customer to get away
from the product.  If the proprietary nvidia driver went open source,
it still wouldn't work with competing cards - the hw is too different.
Copying the _hardware_ is still a copyright infringement, and possibly
also a patent issue.

And that does not in any way prevent open source.  Sure - if you
_change_ that source you invalidate certification, but that is
your problem, not the vendors problem.  It is not a reason to
keep the code secret.  If anything goes wrong, they can simply
point the finger, the vendor driver is ok.
