Not that I know of -- sounds like a nice idea for a patch.

So long as you can update the code in your user space stack that
knows about this, then you should have nothing stopping you.
I've got a major (albeit not well publicized) open source user space
C library for working with cpusets which I will have to fix up.

But there are other *_enabled per-cpuset flags, not naming controllers,
so that is not a robust way to list container types.
Right now, I'm rather fond of the /proc/containers (or should it
be /proc/controllers?) idea.  Though since I don't time to code
the patch today, I'll have to shut up.
