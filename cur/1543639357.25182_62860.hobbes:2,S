Child<->parent resource relationship between system and PCI buses
not only isn't required, but might be simply impossible in some situations.
Consider non-linear (or linear, but just not 1:1) mapping between
system and PCI bus addressing. Or even no mapping at all. ;-)
Yes, most architectures use global resources as parents of PCI resources -
just because it happens to work and is convenient. But this doesn't mean
that everybody must do the same.

Exactly. One day, after firmware update, you may end up asking for
a bit more resource slots. :-)
BTW, do you really need that additional small IOMEM range?

This would add a lot of unneeded complexity to the code in
drivers/pci/setup-bus.c. Also, this would make impossible
configurations like this:
root bus windows	0x80000000-0x8fffffff
			0xf0000000-0xf0ffffff
pci-pci bridge window	0x80200000-0xf02fffff
which is perfectly valid in your setup unless you
place some device resources in the range 0x90000000-0xefffffff.
BTW, you can avoid that range with properly coded pcibios_align_resource() -
maybe this would be cleaner solution than allocating dummy resource.

Ok. But IMO, you're trying to expose your host bridge internals to
the generic code instead of hiding it...
