seems fishy to mount an ntfs filesystem in
/mnt/msdos
:-)

NTFS needs to be supported by kernel to work.
do : "cat /proc/filesystems"
it should look like this, at least for the NTFS line :
~$ cat /proc/filesystems
nodev 
rootfs
nodev 
bdev
nodev 
proc
nodev 
sockfs
nodev 
tmpfs
nodev 
shm
nodev 
pipefs
nodev 
binfmt_misc
	ext2
	minix
	msdos
	vfat
	iso9660
nodev 
smbfs
	ntfs
nodev 
autofs
	reiserfs
nodev 
devpts
	xfs
nodev 
usbdevfs
If it doesn't, either you have to load the NTFS module :
"modprobe ntfs" should do the trick, or compile it directly
into your kernel, if you know how to do.
BTW write support for NTFS is dangerous, only works
(barely) for NT4 volumes, not W2K. You can read
from NTFS safely though.
