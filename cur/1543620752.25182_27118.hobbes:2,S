Hi!
Not sure if this is a 3ware driver 'bug'. This is a 3ware 7810 with 8
100GB disks, configured hw raid0.
part of dmesg:
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
3ware Storage Controller device driver for Linux v1.02.00.010.
scsi0 : Found a 3ware Storage Controller at 0x1090, IRQ: 5, P-chip: 1.3
scsi0 : 3ware Storage Controller
  Vendor: 3ware     Model: 3w-xxxx           Rev: 1.0
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 00
Attached scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
SCSI device sda: 1562951681 512-byte hdwr sectors (-299279 MB)
 sda: unknown partition table
It should say something like 800GB, but says -299279 MB.
This is with the xfs 2.4.17 kernel. The raid works fine, it seemes just
cosmetic, but thought I'd better report it anyway.
