2 of these work just fine, and the third blows up in kobject_uevent().
So wierd, let me dig further...
Hm, it's when we unwind that we blow up on the kobject_uevent, as that's
the first time it is called (gotta love recursion here...)  So it is
really never working for these objects at all, what a mess.
As a work-around for now, you can probably just comment out the
'kobject_uevent() in the file arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mcd_amd_64.c
and everything should work just fine, as there never really was an event
being properly generated before, no one would miss it now :)
I'll keep digging...
thanks,
