Hrm... the format appears to be failing with a seek error.  My guess as 
to the cause of this is either bad media or a bad drive.  Are you sure 
this drive can handle 80 min / 700 MB disks?
I'm not sure this switch does what I think it does because I don't have 
the source code in front of me, but after blanking try:
cdrwtool -m 259808
If that did what I think it does, it should attempt to format the disc, 
but not all of it.  If the drive just doesn't like the outer edges, that 
might work.
