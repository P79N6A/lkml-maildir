Had the same thing with linux-2.2.12 with userland-nfsd as server and
nfs-mounted homedir. Easiest way to reproduce was using by using
netscape and hitting "new mail", which locked the machine semi-hard
(only ping working, nothing else).
It seems to be caused my missing locking abilities. The problem went
away when I mounted the homedirs with the "nolock" option. When I
changed the server to knfsd-1.4.7 with lockd started, I have been able
to remove the "nolock" option without the problem reappearing.
You might try using "-o nolock" and try again to see if it's the same
problem.

P.S.: When trying the same thing with a SunSparc Solaris 2.5.1 as nfs
client the netscape process went into uninterrutable sleep (process
state "D").
