Hmm, after compiling with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 it works fine. But why does 
it work without this option on a 32bit kernel, but not on a 64bit kernel?
32bit kernel, 32bit binary: always works
64bit kernel, 64bit binary: always works
64bit kernel, 32bit binary:
 - always works on knfsd mount points
 - always works with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
 - only works on unfs3 mount points with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 
Do I really have to write a bug report for every single debian package that 
access /etc  and /var to make the maintainers recompile it with 
-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64? 
Btw, whats about Suse, are there all packages compiled with this option? ;)
Cheers, 
(a completely confused) Bernd
