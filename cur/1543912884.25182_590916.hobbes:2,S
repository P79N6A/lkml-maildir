Sorry for top posting, but this is MAYBE a related matter, i am not
sure.
the thing is, i am running with libata and reiserfs on a raid5 with 6
disks, and after i changed to libata it has worked excellently (before
it used to give DMA errors and then go boom).
however now i sometimes, if theres some load on the array, see that the
hdd leds go fully on, and for ~10sec to 1 min, all IO just stops
complete, and after the time, it resumes and works perfectly.
any ideas? and i also bring this up as it may give a clue as to what
causes this. - I also use CFQ
