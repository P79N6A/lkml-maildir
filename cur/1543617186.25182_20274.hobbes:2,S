Nope, no ntfs involved here.                                          
I read the former thread. It was in my mind when trying the increased 
VMALLOC_RESERVE, and voila, it worked again. I must admit in your case
I was very much thinking that ntfs should be fixed, and I am pleased  
the maintainer thought the same :-)                                   
Unfortunately I do not have a good idea about what to do in days where
the graphics cards have more ram onboard than my last workstation had 
in total. If I understood Alans' opinion, he thinks basically the     
same, what the heck can you do about such monster cards? I don't know,
other than adjusting the RESERVE-area. I have not really thought about
it right now, but I suspect it would be rather impossible to make a   
somehow runtime-scalable area working, which would of course be the   
complete solution to the underlying problem.                          
So, what's left? At least configurable? Anybody with a better idea?
