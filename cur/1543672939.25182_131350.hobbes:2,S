I have i810 working on my machine -
1.) You may have already done this - but here it is:  Go to
www.alsa-project.org, under "New Users" click on "Supported Soundcars"
On this page, find the Intel i810 listing, and click on "Details".
Follow all instructions _carefully_.  (I created the devices by
hand - this script didn't work correctly for me.)  Make sure that
both the char-major-14 and char-major-116 devices exist. (14 is OSS
and 116 is ALSA.)  Make sure the aliases are correct in modprobe.conf.
2.) After that, (or if you've already done that), use amixer to look
at and set the sound controls for your card.  NOTE:  the i810 driver
has a "gotcha".  To set the volume for the line out jack on you PC
you will probably have to use the "Headphone" mixer control.  That
little curve ball stumped me till somebody else dropped me the hint.
3.) If all that still doesn'te work, post again.
