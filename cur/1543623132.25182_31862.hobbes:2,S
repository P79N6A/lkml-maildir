ARP is irrelevant to security. You don't need the ARP layer to do any
attacks or routing at all. There are a million ways to get the mac
address of a box.

Its supposed to accept any packet for that system.  Thats correct behaviour
for the system.
Thats why you can have firewall rules. You'll find the standard Red Hat firewall
config tool sets up interface based rule sets. In fact in general rules should be
interface not address based.
