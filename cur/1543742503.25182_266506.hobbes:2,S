Perhaps this is why you see in many header files code like this:
    static inline xxx_const_case(...) { ... }
    static inline xxx_nonconst_case(...) { ... }
#define xxx(...) __builtin_constant_p(...) ? xxx_const_case(...) \
					   : xxx_nonconst_case(...)
i.e. gcc is better in optimizing away calls to non-called functions?

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
