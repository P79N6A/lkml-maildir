Subject: [PATCH] : Intel fixed mtrr support.

I wrote a patch that adds support for setting the fixed mtrrs (the ones
responsible for the memory in the bottom 1MB). Setting them is useful
for programs that use the vga aperture memory (svgalib programs mainly).
The patch changes only the file arch/i386/kernel/mtrr.c
