Ive had a few problems with irq timeouts, they were specific to my hpt366
controller.
You might want to checkout your kernel archive under /people/hedrick at
patch it with the latest ide patch from there.
Also in that directory are some txt files displaying warning specific to a
couple of ide controllers.
