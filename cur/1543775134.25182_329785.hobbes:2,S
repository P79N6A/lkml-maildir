different problem. the sync will get the byte out of the cpu. It won't
get it out of the pci bridges...
In short, pci bridges are allowed to buffer (post) writes until data
traffic in the other direction happens (eg readl() or dma). 
In cases where you want your writel to hit the device instantly (and
disabling irqs is generally one of those) you need to flush this posting
cache with a dummy readl().

is a patch to simulate this behavior more agressive
