This patch updates UML to 2.5.63.  The major change in this patch is the
inclusion of hostfs and hppfs, which were 2.4-only until someone figured
out the 2.5 vfs changes enough to forward port them.  This was done by Petr
Baudis, who ported hostfs.  I used those changes to bring hppfs forward.
hostfs seems to work OK, although there is a loose end or two that needs 
fixing.  hppfs is non-functional now, although it does mount and mirror
procfs.
There were also a bunch of bug fixes:
	some interrupt blocking bugs are fixed
	a ubd driver file locking bug is gone
