i did try "nice --20" too :) Resulted in long X stalls, but i don't
think that's a reasonable load so I did not mention it.
"nice -20 cmd" runs cmd at nice==19.
Usage: nice [OPTION] [COMMAND [ARG]...]
Run COMMAND with an adjusted niceness, which affects process scheduling.
With no COMMAND, print the current niceness.  Nicenesses range from
-20 (most favorable scheduling) to 19 (least favorable).
  -n, --adjustment=N   add integer N to the niceness (default 10)
