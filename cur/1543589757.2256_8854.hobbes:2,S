If I understand correctly, some vendor would put I2O messaging hardware but
they would use it in a non-standard way ? So, if they dont support the I2O
protocol with their hardware, I will have to do it in another  way...
Is there a simple way to find out if my device support I2O protocol ? Maybe
its written in the BAR or in the CSR, but does linux find those devices
automaticly ? or do I have to do it in my module ? If I must do it myself,
do you know any device that is doing something like I do ? so I could look
at the code.
Thank again.
