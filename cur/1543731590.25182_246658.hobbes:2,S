I don't thing naming anything larger than PDA or phone as "large 
computer" is correct/acceptable :o)
If fact Solaris works quite well on usual desktop size computer.
Probalby after full porting Solaris to x86 using system on embeded 
system definitely will not be only potential solution.
Even if Solaris after this still can'd be useable on embeded-like systems
this can't matter on DTrace subject :)
