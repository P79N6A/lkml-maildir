The controller itself cannot be initialized anymore.  The message "MMIO
resource... unavailable" is because ohci1394's call to
request_mem_region failed, i.e. when it tried to request the
memory-mapping of controller registers.
I have no idea how this could happen, therefore I Cc lkml.  It's not a
problem with the IEEE 1394 drivers.
Besides the kernel update, did you change anything in the BIOS or even
the hardware?  Do you boot the old kernels with the same boot parameters
as you did before you added the new kernel?
