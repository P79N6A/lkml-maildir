Right, and that's a problem, because the 'bit more' it does
requires a target compiler -- which isn't available while
bootstrapping the target compiler!
The way things are now, I can build toolchains for everything
except the sh architecture (though my toolchain bootstrap script
is ugly as noted due to the lack of 'make symlinks').
I'm not sure if the sh architecture makefile even has targets
to make all the needed symlinks in the absense of a working
target compiler; I'll look at that and maybe submit a minimal
patch when I get a chance.
