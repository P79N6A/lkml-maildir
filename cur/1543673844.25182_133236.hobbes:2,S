I tested the patch, and it solves the IRQ latency problems by moving
the delay outside of the ISR. The debouncing period reduces the
rate of thrashing back and forth between wake and suspend, but
the cycle does continue forever:

This patch removes my complaint, but I do wonder why this
unused controller continually generates the USBSTS_RD
indications. I would hope HP used pull-ups/downs on unused
input signals of the PIIX3 chipset, but maybe not.
I also can't vouch for the correct operation of this patch
for fully functional USB implementations.
If you have other tests you want me to do to try and figure
out a sane way of dealing with such unused controllers,
just ask.
Thanks,
Paul
