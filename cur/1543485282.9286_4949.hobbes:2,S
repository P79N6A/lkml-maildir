Hello again,
There seems to be another problem with caching and NFS. I do not know
if the problem is on the serveur side or on the client side.
My two boxes are Linux running 2.2.1-ac3. The serveur is running knfsd
version 981204.
The client creates some files and directories on the serveur.
Then, on the serveur, we remove all that staff (rm -rf all_that_staff).
A few seconds later, we are trying to create again the same files and
directories from the client and get a 'file already exists' for each
directory.
A+
