You will be happy to know that yes, it does make a difference.
Applied to -mm4, RAID-1 now comes up with all arrays in sync and everything 
looking good.  Tried it twice, and both times raid-1 came up perfectly with
md0 : active raid1 sdc2[1] sda2[0]
       24410688 blocks [2/2] [UU]
       bitmap: 0/187 pages [0KB], 64KB chunk
for each md.
