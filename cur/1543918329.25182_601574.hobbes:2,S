i just tried:
  gcc version 4.1.2 20070626 (Red Hat 4.1.2-13)
and indeed the crash is gone. So you are completely right, it's a 
compiler bug in 4.0.2 (it's vanilla gcc 4.0.2 built by me, not a distro 
compiler). It should not affect normal kernels too much this bug needs 
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC. (or it needs a _really_ unlucky allocation being 
at the far upper end of RAM - but those are usually taken up by 
boot-time allocations anyway).
i also just re-tried the other config as well - and crash is gone there 
too. (not surprisingly)
