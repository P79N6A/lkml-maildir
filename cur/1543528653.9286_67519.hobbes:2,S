Oh, and added to this, v2.4 will probably support at least these (unless
someone reverses the patches) in addition:
	- PowerPC (64 bits)
	- MIPS (64 bits)
	- SuperH (32 bits)
Right now, the S390 port is v2.2 only; I hope it'll be forward-ported
into the v2.3 tree as soon as v2.3 stabilizes a little.
Now what I see is missing would be:
	- Whatever processor VAX:en use
	- 88k
	- Crays (the non-vector models; I suspect that Linux doesn't
		 would be very suitable on a vector-machine. But I could
		 be wrong)
	- AS/400 (something akin to the S/390 port; a virtual machine
		  is needed because of the lack of memory protection in
		  hardware)
Have I missed something out?!
