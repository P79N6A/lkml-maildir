Do you have ALI_INIT_CODE_TEST in the file defined or undef ?
If its defined then this means the code path that causs the problem is
quite small and is in the function
ata66_ali15x3
Can you comment out the bit below and see if that is the cure
        /*
         * CD_ROM DMA on (m5229, 0x53, bit0)
	 *	Enable this bit even if we want to use PIO
	 * PIO FIFO off (m5229, 0x53, bit1)
	 *	The hardware will use 0x54h and 0x55h to control PIO FIFO
	 */
	pci_read_config_byte(dev, 0x53, &tmpbyte);
	tmpbyte = (tmpbyte & (~0x02)) | 0x01;
	pci_write_config_byte(dev, 0x53, tmpbyte);
