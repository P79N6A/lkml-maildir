You don't need to. Port 0x80 historically is about 8uS so just udelay(8)
and make sure the initial default delay is conservative enough before the
CPU speed is computed.
0x80 should be fine for anything PC compatible anyway, its specifically
reserved as a debug port and supported for *exactly* that purpose by
many chipsets.
The afflicted laptop should really be taken up with the vendor. If its
got port 0x80 wrong gods knows what else it might have problems with.
