Yeah, actually I've been thinking about this issue a lot.  I think it
would make a lot of sense to export this sort of thing under the
"pci_bus" class in sysfs.  The ISA enable bit should probably also be
exported.  Furthermore, we should be verifying the BIOS's configuration
of VGA and ISA.  I'll try to integrate this in my future releases.  I
appreciate the code.
I also have a number of resource management plans for the VGA enable bit
that I'll get into in my next set of patches.

That would be great.  Most of my experience has been with only a couple
legacy IO port ranges passing through the bridge.
Thanks,
