Yes, you're correct :-)

I guess you're using linux's software raid?
If so, you're hitting the 120MB/sec (and I *think* this time I'm 
correct! :-)
If this is a PCI32/33mhz slot you're not going to be able to get more 
juice. (I bet that 3 concurrent dd's gets you 40MB each).
Anyway, this may be offtopic because the problem (only 20MB/sec for the 
raid with 4 disks) should be something else... Sorry for the noise.

Mine outputs some fabulous values too... I'm not sure I trust them ;)
# hdparm -T /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
  Timing cached reads:   3536 MB in  2.00 seconds = 1767.38 MB/sec
