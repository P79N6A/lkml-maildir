Knfsd threads in 2.6 are no longer serialised by the BKL, and the
change has exposed a number of SMP issues in the dcache.  Try the
two patches at
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108330112505555&w=2
and
http://linus.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@1.1722.48.23
(the latter is in recent Linus kernels).  If you're still having
problems after applying those patches, Nathan and I need to know.
Greg.
