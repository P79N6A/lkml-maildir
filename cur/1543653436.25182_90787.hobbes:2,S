Mark's right, it should be EINTR.  EAGAIN shouldn't break any
single-thread user state machines using poll/select, as a non-blocking
read is always allowed to return EAGAIN for any transient reason.
I'm not sure if EAGAIN can cause a poll() wakeup event to be missed.
If so, that would be a TCP bug that breaks epoll, and it would also
break some user state machines using poll/select, when there are
multiple processes waiting on a socket.
