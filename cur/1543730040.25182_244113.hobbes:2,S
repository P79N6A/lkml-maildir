I'll give it a go on Monday, when I have some more time reserved on the 512p 
system.  Last time I tried enabling oprofile, the system wouldn't boot or at 
least got so slow that I didn't want to wait for it (i.e. init started, but 
the system pretty much hung part way through the init scripts).
If it boots, I'll try collecting some info.  John, will the oprofile tools in 
RHEL3 work with 2.6.8.1-mm3 + these patches?
Thanks,
Jesse
