One should be able to do that.  Of course, modprobe & co will then
have to reside in the trusted core, since they're effectively running
with kernel permissions (from a trust perspective, not a bug
perspective.)
Since modprobe needs to be able to install kernel code, there aren't
any permissions it *doesn't* have anyway...
