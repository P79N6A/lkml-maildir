Hi,
I have a Silicon Image 3114 controller on a dual opteron box with 4
ST3160023AS drives. The root is a software RAID5 with xfs. I have not
been able to get 2.6.15 or 2.6.16 to boot on this machine. 2.6.14
boots up just fine.
With 2.6.16 the sata probing process is very slow and I get the
following output:
ata1: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113)
ata1: dev 0 ATA-6, max UDMA/133, 312581808 sectors: LBA48
ata1: qc timeout (cmd 0xef)
ata1: failed to set xfermode, disabled
ata1: dev 0 configured for UDMA/100
scsi0 : sata_sil
... repeats for ata[234] and then fails to find the root device ...
With 2.6.14:
ata1: dev 0 cfg 49:2f00 82:346b 83:7d01 84:4003 85:3469 86:3c01 87:4003 88:207f
ata1: dev 0 ATA, max UDMA/133, 312581808 sectors: lba48
ata1: dev 0 configured for UDMA/100
scsi0 : sata_sil
... ata[234] output, boots just fine ...
                                      Any ideas?
                                      Clem
