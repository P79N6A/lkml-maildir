Yes, or it may be taken inside a section that needs interrupts off for
correctness (eg. if it is holding an irq safe lock). And in the current
implementation I don't think the plain _irq variants reenable interrupts
because that would require reading the register.
Would it be sufficient to just do pair-wise rendezvous, where the
initiating CPU is in a known good state? For TSC sync it might be...
