Could you please please pretty please get an RFC compliant mailer that
generates "In-Reply-To" and preferable even "References" headers? Right
now every mail you write starts a new thread instead of referencing to
the previous one. See 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/25/180/
 to see what I
mean.

So? Firefox is as available as IE, but it's not as used as IE. Does
that make IE better?

You have been told a couple of times that a tar implementation in
kernel is indeed larger than a cpio implementation. If you're not a
coder, just believe the coders.

The simplicity of ramfs inspires more than enough confidence.

An initramfs can be used to do the same, but doesn't have the overhead
of a block device. IOW: it requires even *less* than an initrd.

What makes you think tmpfs is more robust than ramfs? What do you mean
with a "robust filesystem"?
