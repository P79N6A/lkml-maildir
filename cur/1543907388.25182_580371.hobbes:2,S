Okay, you don't need to be an experienced Open Firmware developer.
In fact I know we have had experienced Open Firmware developers who have
said that our firmware sucks (some comment about "shitty German engineering",
I really did quit caring after that point) because they could not run probe-all
from the "ok" prompt.
In the first few pages of the OF spec, it very clearly states that this will
probably make your system explode.
So even experts do not know what they are doing. I don't expect users to.
But as an engineer, here, I think patching the device-type in the boot
wrapper (be it the chrp boot loader) is the wrong place, because we have
had real experts here (Ben, Segher etc.) complain that fixing the device
tree in the boot wrapper is no substitute for a correctly working
firmware.
