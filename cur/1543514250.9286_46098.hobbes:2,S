 Sorry .., the card is not here .. but I can get this info maybe tomorrow,
(if I have time to go to where the server is installed. .. :-P )
 But on /proc/pci  (I know, I know .. the info show there is not accurage
..) the card was detected as Network Device .. Unknown vendor, Unknown
Device ...
 Umm .. I think the vendor ID is 655 .. I'm not 100% sure now
