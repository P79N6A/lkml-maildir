Are you comfortable compiling kernels?
If not I'll compile one for you for the test.
Currently I'm happily under 2.4.0-test 12: 
   lsmod:

ppp_deflate            39164   1  (autoclean)

ppp_async               6220   1  (autoclean)
ppp_generic            12820   2  (autoclean) [ppp_deflate bsd_comp

   Are there any particular kernel config choices that will be
beneficial for this problem?

Can these be included in the LTmodem packages you are working up?
