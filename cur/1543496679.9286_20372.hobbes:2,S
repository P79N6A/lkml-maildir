	After changing hard drive on my server and creating big partition
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/hda3            6875136 3233968  3284927     50%   /var
I found several strange messges in syslog:
May 22 09:01:59 irina kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,3)): ext2_new_block: Free blocks count corrupted for block group 36
May 22 09:20:05 irina kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,3)): ext2_new_block: Free blocks count corrupted for block group 36
May 22 09:20:05 irina kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,3)): ext2_new_block: Free blocks count corrupted for block group 36
May 22 09:30:04 irina kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,3)): ext2_new_block: Free blocks count corrupted for block group 36
May 22 09:40:06 irina kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,3)): ext2_new_block: Free blocks count corrupted for block group 36
May 22 09:40:06 irina kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,3)): ext2_new_block: Free blocks count corrupted for block group 36
	Due to lot of such messages I reboot machine into single user mode
and run e2fsck for this partition. After that I start machine again and during
2 days of uptime I've got the following messages:
May 22 23:45:02 irina kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device ide0(3,3)): ext2_unlink: Deleting nonexistent file (993908), 0

May 23 08:25:09 irina kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device ide0(3,3)): ext2_free_inode: bit already cleared for inode 297267
I never saw something like that before changing hardrive.
