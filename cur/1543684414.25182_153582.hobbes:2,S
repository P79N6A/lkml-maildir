Subject: IP multicast errors with linux 2.6.0-test2 and SiS900

I'm experiencing some strange behavior with IP multicast in linux
2.6.0-test2 on a SiS900 NIC.
It will only receive multicast packets with destination address
239.1.1.*, unless I "ifconfig eth0 allmulti".  With allmulti set, all
multcast addresses are received.  Setting promisc mode also does the
trick.
This isn't the intended bahavior, is it?
