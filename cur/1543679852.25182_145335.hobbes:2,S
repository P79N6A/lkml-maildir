	Dear kernel hackers,
	In a little appliance (i386) I'm working on I have a linux(2.4.20 vanilla) 
booting with a pretty nice logo in fb mode, but I dont want to see text in 
the boot process just the logo, so I tryed on boot : linux console=tty2, but 
still see everything, If i put to ttyS0 works but I have a modem there,so its 
not a good idea, anyway tty2 should work, but it doesnt, any idea?
	I can't use bootsplash because the initrd image I need its already too big 
and actually I prefer to use just the vanilla kernel.
	Can be redirected to /dev/null the console? I know this its not a good idea 
but, I can have to lilo entrys the first one with console=tty and the other 
one with console=null?
	Greetings
