Wrong.
	CPU0				CPU1
	-------------			-------------------
	hardirq_endlock()
					do_IRQ
					timer_interrupt()
					mark_bh(TIMER_BH)
					do_bottom_half
					global_bh_count still 1 (other CPU)
					so skip bh processing.
					iret (return to userspace)
	softirq_endlock (too late!)
	clear global_bh_count
	ret from do_bottom_half
	(timer_bh not run)		(timer_bh not run)
as just said in UP it only matters that we take irq disabled after we read
active as zero the last time. But in SMP a spinlock is necessary.
When I'll have all the race fixed, I'll think on how to fix the starvation
issue without risking to wait for 10msec (or less than 1msec on alpha)
before processing a bh. I just like hate to left the above SMP races
opened just because they doesn't happen often.
