I just realized, I forgot that in 2.2 it was a separate driver that
supported it and so, having booted into 2.2.x I assumed that the same
driver that supports the cardbus one will pick up the 905C-TX one and so
didn't do modprobe 3c59x. I will test this now but it is almost certain it
should work.
The reason I had to boot into 2.2.x is because 2.4.x didn't like the 21150
bridge. I need to find out why.

Tigran
