While I agree that ALSA is better than OSS... I don't actually think
ALSA kernel<>user api is... at least for my purposes. I'm still using
OSS emulation, because I could not get alsa proper to work... and the
advanced stuff just does not work in emulation.
In OSS days, if you wanted to test kernel sound driver, you did:
mknod /dev/dsp
cat /bin/bash > /dev/dsp.
With alsa+oss emulation, you need
mknod /dev/mixer
install aumix
aumix
mknod /dev/dsp
cat /bin/bash > /dev/dsp.
With alsa proper, it is
install alsalib
create about 5 device nodes
install alsautils
maybe do some config?
aplay some.wav
..provided you have .wav near you. I'm not sure if it is possible to
produce sounds using normal shell scripting? (w/o alsautils)?
I can even test kernel graphics drivers by cat /bin/bash > /dev/fb0...
it would be nice to have equivalent for audio... OSS API seems to be
the equivalent these days, but please don't deprecate it.
