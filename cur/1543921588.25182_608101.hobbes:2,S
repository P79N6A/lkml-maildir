take a look at struct writeback_control:
        unsigned nonblocking:1;         /* Don't get stuck on request queues */
        unsigned encountered_congestion:1; /* An output: a queue is full */
        unsigned for_kupdate:1;         /* A kupdate writeback */
        unsigned for_reclaim:1;         /* Invoked from the page allocator */
        unsigned for_writepages:1;      /* This is a writepages() call */
        unsigned range_cyclic:1;        /* range_start is cyclic */
        unsigned more_io:1;             /* more io to be dispatched */
Add another one...
