Yes, you're right. 
We could do the whole "oldfs = get_fs(); set_fs(KERNEL_DS); .. 
set_fs(oldfs);" crud, but it would probably be better to just add an 
architected accessor. Especially since it's going to generally just be a
	#define get_kernel_careful(val,p) __get_user(val,p)
for most architectures.
We've needed that before (and yes, we've simply mis-used __get_user() on 
x86 before rather than add it).
