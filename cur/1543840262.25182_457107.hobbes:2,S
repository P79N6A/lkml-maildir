Take it easy ! I'm not objecting your explanation. Your explanation, which
was not asked, sounded to me like I said something wrong/bad on this
amputation. I have prefered to make things clear, no more.

Actually my point is that it could be usefull for _all_ embedded systems,
whatever the arches it comes from, couldn't it ?

So does it make sense to you to have
linux/driver/apm
|-- apm_userland_interface_emulation_and_not_a_power_management_infrastructure.c
|-- idle.c
|-- core.c
linux/arch/arm/kernel/
|- apm_specific_to_arm_which_is_needed_by_generic_driver.c
| ...
for example ?

apm_queue_event() (and kapmd) doens't seem something usefull for user space.
It seems to be designed to be used by the kernel no ?

Could you point out where it is handled ?

Sure, but something that can reflect that it's a userland interface emulation
implementation would have been usefull. APM, despite it's already used by APM
BIOS terminology, is rather a name for a complete subsystem.
