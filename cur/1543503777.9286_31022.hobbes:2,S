I have rewritten the PPP driver, separating the generic part from the
async serial part.  The new code is IMHO a lot cleaner than the old
ppp.c.  There is now a ppp_generic.c, which implements the ppp network
interface units and the /dev/ppp device, and ppp_async.c, which
implements the PPP encapsulation and framing for async serial lines.
The patch is at:
ftp://cs.anu.edu.au/pub/people/Paul.Mackerras/newppp.patch.gz
It should apply OK against either 2.2.10 or 2.3.10.  You will need a
new pppd, which you can get at:
ftp://cs.anu.edu.au/pub/software/ppp/ppp-pre-2.3.9.tar.gz
I did all this before I became aware of Daniel Marmier's post of a
week or two ago.  I'm looking at merging his changes and mine.
Paul.
