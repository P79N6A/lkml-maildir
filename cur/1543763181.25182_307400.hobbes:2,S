The patch is obviously safe enough, but seems a bit kludgy.
The basic problem here appears to be that isofs is doing iget/iput in
->fill_super before MS_ACTIVE is set and the inode freeing code
(generic_forget_inode) doesn't expect that to happen, yes?
I wonder if it would make more sense for all the ->fill_super callers to
set MS_ACTIVE prior to calling ->fill_super(), and clear MS_ACTIVE if
fill_super() failed?
