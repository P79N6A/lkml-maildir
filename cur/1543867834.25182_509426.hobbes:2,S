I say it does.  If you have the ability, and enjoy Linux, you should
try and make the time to contribute some code or other assistance to
the Linux project.

Good stuff.

It's written in black and white, in the license.  Apart from that,
Greg KH has made his opinion clear, and you have said you understand
and don't debate that he holds this opinion, and his code is what you
said you were linking to (the sysfs/class stuff), so why do you keep
saying that "it is not clear".
Do you think that, somehow, Linus' opinion trumps Greg KH's opinion on
his own code?
