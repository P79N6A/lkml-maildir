Subject: [PATCH 11/15] sas_ata: Don't copy aic94xx's sactive to ata_port
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/17/276

Since the aic94xx sequencer assigns its own NCQ tags to ATA commands, it
no longer makes any sense to copy the sactive field in the STP response
to ata_port->sactive, as that will confuse libata.  Also, libata seems
to be capable of managing sactive on its own.
The attached patch gets rid of one of the causes of the BUG messages in
ata_qc_new, and seems to work without problems on an IBM x206m.
