Well, as I said, I prefer keeping PIO numbers 0 based so that legacy
crap works. If 0 is to be illegal, then remap any devive that's sitting
there, but don't do weirder remapping tricks than necessary ;-) 
Note that on PowerPC, we do actually remap PIO on non-primary busses
(well, we have to since we have to present a flat space to inx/outx).
What we do there is basically we "pick" a bus as beeing primary
(typically the one that has an ISA bridge and/or SuperIO on it) and
that's the one that gets PIO 0. Resources for device on that domain
aren't fixed up.
All other ones are fixed up in such a way that pointer arithmeric gives
you an inx/outx landing in the right spot for PCI devices.

Yes. Though adoption of iomap is a bit slow on the driver side of
things.

Well, hopefully new drivers don't need PIO as it's about time people
stop releasing devices that do PIO, bloody hell ! That should have been
"deprecated use for compatibility only" from day #1 :-) In fact, if I'm
not mistaken, the PCI spec mandates that device should have an MMIO way
of doing everything that can be done via PIO nowadays no ?
