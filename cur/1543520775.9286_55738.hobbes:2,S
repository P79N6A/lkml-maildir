/dev/sda10 is the correct mount that I am attempting to use and that works
with my other kernels. I built the Adaptec SCSI controllers into the kernel
to avoid this problem. I will recheck my configuration and try again and let
you know how it goes. BTW as an aside how did you interpret the error
message I have you to a reference to /dev/sda10?
Thanks,

The kernel is attempting to mount /dev/sda10.  Is this the right hard
disc and partition for you?
If that's correct, you probably didn't configure the appropriate scsi
driver into your kernel.  If it isn't, you need to tell it which hard
disc partition is your root device in the lilo.conf.
