..  that if you really wanted a secure process, you'd take care to
program it so that it didn't use 8MB of stack, and you'd take care to
start it with a stack limit of something more reasonable, like maybe
100K. That way you only need to stake a claim to 100K of backing swap
for that secure process, and no big deal all round.
Actually, I can think of one more process that I'd like to have as
secure apart from init and cron .. the software watchdog. I kill
apache regularly on servers anyway, just to keep it under control.
