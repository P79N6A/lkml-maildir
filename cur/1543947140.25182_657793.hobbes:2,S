I've been getting an immediate hang on boot since:
e06b8b98da071f7dd78fb7822991694288047df0 kbuild: allow -fstack-protector to take effect
This is on an x86_64 system (actually an Intel SDV -- so it might be 
"special").
My .config has the following:
CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR=y
CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_ALL=y
Let me know if you need more information.
Interestingly, git-bisect was unable to identify the changeset, and 
reliably mis-identified this as the problem:
71c044752cdae89136862495f244d37073e2cf66 V4L/DVB (7080): zr364xx: add support for Pentax Optio 50
(which I don't even build).
