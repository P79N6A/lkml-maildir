Not true at all (as I've stated many times in the past...)
The USB patches that I send to Linus through BK are all sent to the
linux-usb-devel mailing list as followups to this message.
They are also placed at kernel.org in:
	/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/usb/2.5/*.2.5.66*
So no, I always provide patches, I just don't flood lkml with USB
specific ones.
thanks,
greg k-h
