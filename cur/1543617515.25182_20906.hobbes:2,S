Here's what I do to reproduce it:
$ tar yxvf linux-2.4.17.tar.bz2
...
$ cd cml2-2.1.2
$ ./install-cml2 /home/ross/linux
Examining your build environment...
Good. You have Python 2.x installed as 'python' already.
Python looks sane...
Good, your python has curses support linked in.
Good, your python has Tk support linked in.
Compiling file list...
Operating on /home/ross/linux...
Installing new files...
Merging in CML2 help texts from Configure.help...
Modifying configuration productions...
You are ready to go, cd to /home/ross/linux.
$ cd ../linux
$ make config
At this point the rules are compiled and a dialog box indicates that
Suppression has been turned off (press any key to continue).  I hit any key and
am presented with the first menu.
The first selection at the top of the screen is "Intel or Processor type
(FROZEN)" and it is highlighted as the default selection.  If I press enter
*boom*, I'm locked solid.  If I move the active selection off of this menu item,
I can't move back to it, though it remains visible.  If I enter a submenu, the
frozen processor type menu is gone.
It's reproduceable with fresh trees (as above), existing trees, and at least
linux 2.4.12 and linux 2.4.17 (the two kernel tarballs I have lying around).
I'm planning on trying this on a Debian testing box I have at work at some
point.
