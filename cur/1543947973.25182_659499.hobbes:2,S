Subject: [BUG] 2.6.25-rc3 hangs in early boot on Sun Ultra5

Booting 2.6.25-rc3 on my Ultra5 causes a hang before or as
the console is switched over to the framebuffer. The console
output is (extrapolated from dmesg in -rc2 and handwritten
notes, as I don't have a serial cable to my U5):
PROMLIB: Sun IEEE Boot Prom 'OBP 3.25.3 2000/06/29 14:12'
PROMLIB: Root node compatible: 
*** the following line can't be seen in dmesg after rc2 has booted

*** the following line can't be seen in dmesg after rc2 has booted
console handover: boot [earlyprom0] -> real [tty0]
At this point rc3 hangs hard and won't even respond to sysrq.
Another difference is that with rc2 the first few lines of kernel
output while the console is still in OF mode either aren't shown
or disappear quickly since the switch to the framebuffer occurs
within a fraction of a second after the kernel has been loaded.
With rc3 the kernel output (the text shown above) in the OF-mode
console is very very slow.
(I should have quoted my .config here but I forgot to bring it.
It's exactly the same in rc2 and rc3, however.)
I'll try some rc2->rc3 bisecting later.
