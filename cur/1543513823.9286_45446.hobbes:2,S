Slightly revised version.  We should look up routes based on the src, dst,
and tos, and select a local address by the gateway.  So i modified
ip_masq_select_addr to have many more parameters so it can make a more
informed decision. (and correct one)
I'm learning! Yay!
Also incorporate Alexey's suggested fix to ip_masq_user.c, where
maddr=rt->rt_src is actually correct.
