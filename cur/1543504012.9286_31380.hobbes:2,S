Yeap.  __get_free_pages always returns objects aligned to their own size.
So just do
	addr = __get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL, 18 - PAGE_SHIFT); /*256KB*/
to get the memory you need.  One other thing to consider is that since it
is a large contiguous chunk of memory, you should probably allocate it at
load time in order to avoid things like open() failing sporadically.
