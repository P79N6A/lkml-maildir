If you only ran the test once, could this be due to disk access and caching of 
the original command by the block layer?
You'd be better off getting rid of tar from the equation, by creating the tar 
output on disk, and then copying that to null to prime the disk cache before 
you perform your tests. Avoid any other disk activity on the box, as it could 
flush the disk cache and change the results.
