I too am having problems with this sound driver on my system with this 
kernel release.
After booting the system, I found it would crash (blinking keyboard 
lights) within a few minutes of starting xwindows.  Upon seeing the 
notes about the AC'97 driver causing problems, I commented it out from 
the /etc/modules.conf and I have been stable (although mute) since.
The motherboard is an Intel D845GBV (uni-processor), and according to 
Intel the (built in) sound controller (quoted from the spec sheet 
http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/bv/index.htm
) "Audio subsystem for 
AC '97 processing using the Analog Devices AD1981A codec featuring 
SoundMAX Cadenza"
Although I don't have a copy of the oops message I'm sure if it would 
help I can set up a serial console to catch it.
The lines I had in the /etc/modules.conf (that I commented out) are:
alias sound-slot-0 i810_audio
alias sound-slot-0-0 i810_audio
alias char-major-14 i810_audio
alias sound-slot-1 btaudio
pre-remove sound-slot-0 /bin/aumix-minimal -f /etc/.aumixrc -S 
 >/dev/null 2>&1 || :
my .config file (for the sound) is:
# Sound
#
CONFIG_SOUND=m
# CONFIG_SOUND_ALI5455 is not set
# CONFIG_SOUND_BT878 is not set
# CONFIG_SOUND_CMPCI is not set
# CONFIG_SOUND_EMU10K1 is not set

# CONFIG_SOUND_MSNDPIN is not set

Let me know what else I can provide to help.
