Denied.  No way in hell that (or similar) will ever go in.  Locking must
be consistent, _period_.  No provisions for "legacy drivers" and crap
like that - it's a standard policy in all kernel and that had been discussed
a lot of times.
_Please_, check 2.5.  We already don't take BKL on majority of directory
operations.  The rest will follow pretty soon.
In particular, in current Linus' tree there are 3 (three) instances of
lock_kernel() in fs/namei.c.  Namely, ->permission() and two calls of
d_move().  The latter will go when ->d_parent mess is cleaned up.  The
former will go as soon as we get to ->setattr()/->permission() cleanups -
hopefully in a week or so.
In general, such changes are done by global lock shifting - simultaneous
for all instances and being a trivial search-and-replace.  Once the lock
is taken inside the method individual filesystems/drivers/etc. can
shrink the protected areas - in separate patches.
That's how it works - and that's how it had been done for most of the methods
already.  Magic flags that make locking different for different instances
are Not Good.  And not needed - see above for the usual way to do that stuff.
