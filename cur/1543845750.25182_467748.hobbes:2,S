I'm sure it's the point for the FSF. Is it really the point for anybody 
else? Everybody else is better off with the more permissive license..

I suspect the FSF might well be _very_ careful here. If they move to "v3 
or later", they had better be damn sure somebody won't license-fork that 
project, or they'll be left with nothing at all.
So I would not be entirely surprised if projects remain "v2 or later" just 
because it's to nobodys advantage to play chicken.
But who knows..

It obviously doesn't have to be, but it gets a lot harder to do later, if 
the project has any appreciable amount of real development.
Of course, a lot of projects probably don't have that much. I haven't 
followed, but I don't get the feeling that bash or fileutils have a huge 
amount of constant changes..
