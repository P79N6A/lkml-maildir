writepage() and readpage() will never be symmetric...
readpage()
	program can't continue until data is there
	reading in larger clusters eats (wastes?) more memory
	done when we think a process needs data
writepage()
	called after the process has written data and moved on
	writing larger clusters has no influence on memory use
	often done to free up memory
Since readpage() needs to tune readahead behaviour, we will
always want to give it some information (eg. in the file *)
so it can do the extra things it needs to do.

Rik
