Yes, that's a problem, and that's why I posted a filter to do the
bulk of the work.  It seems like the easiest way would be for Linus
to run the script and generate a patch at his end.  There are only
a handful of patches in -mm that touch MAINTAINERS, so it shouldn't
generate too many conflicts there.
