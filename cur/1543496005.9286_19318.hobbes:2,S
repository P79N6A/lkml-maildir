Hi,
It is so obvious I couldn't believe my eyes, and had to ask a second
opinion in this matter, and I therfore didn't provide a patch first
time around.
It looks as if noone with a 64 bit machine has gotten bitten by this
yet, but the IDE/64bit architecture combination is getting more and
more common.
lba_sects is defined as a long, which is 64 bits on 64-bit
architectures like Alpha.
Supposed it has the value 0x12345678, and the original code is used:
	lba_sects = (lba_sects << 16) | (lba_sects >> 16);
then, we assign
	lba_sects = 0x123456780000  | 0x1234
	          = 0x123456781234
which is not the intention: we wanted 0x56781234.
I therefore propose the following patch:
diff -ur linux-2.2.9.clean/drivers/block/ide-disk.c linux/drivers/block/ide-disk.c
