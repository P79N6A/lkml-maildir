If you don't care about backwards compatibility, then yes. You just have 
to use "strict" UTF-8.

You get to choose between "throw the baby out with the bathwater" or "be 
compatible". 
Sane people choose compatibility. But it's your choice. You can always 
normalize thing if you want to - but don't complain to me if it breaks 
things. It will still break _fewer_ things than UCS-4 would, so even if 
you always normalize you'd still be _better_ off with UTF-8 than you would 
be with UCS-4.
