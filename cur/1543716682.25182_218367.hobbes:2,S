That is such an obvious troll and flame bait, I really do not know why I
am responding.  Please, try to be civil here.  The point of Linux isis,
if you don't like the way things are today, you can change them.  Try
that with Microsoft products (for that manner, please show me how you
can do what you are trying to do on Windows 2000, driver stuff there is
_so_ much more complex...)
But before you try to do that (which basically is moving things back to
the way things used to be years ago in 2.2), why don't you try to state
the problem you are having.  Perhaps it can be solved in a different
manner than what you are trying to do.
So, what are you trying to fix/solve/monitor/do here?
thanks,
