Just an fyi, the procps changes to support this new feature are now in
CVS.
CVS information, as well as CVS snapshots with the support, are
available from: 
http://tech9.net/rml/procps/
Note old procps packages will still work as the old wchan field is still
exported in stat.
Large machines using ps or top with the WCHAN field should see a
difference.  Also, procps no longer requires System.map.
