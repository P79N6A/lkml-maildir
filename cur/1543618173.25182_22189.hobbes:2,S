See:
int access_process_vm(struct task_struct *tsk, unsigned long addr, void *buf, int len, int write)
{
...
                flush_cache_page(vma, addr);
...
}
flush_cache_page() is passed a non-page aligned address.  AFAIK that is
the only instance where the flush_{cache,tlb}_* stuff is called with
non-page aligned addresses.
