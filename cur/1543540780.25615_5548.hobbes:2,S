Hi Bert,

It does not work today.  The resident kernel has many places that
test whether CONFIG_*_MODULE is defined.  I count 378 of these tests
in 2.4.0-test5.
    files_chS=$(find * -type -name '*.[chS]' -print)
    echo $files_chS | xargs grep "CONFIG_[A-Za-z0-9_]*_MODULE" | less
When someone, maybe me, gets around to documenting the kernel build
procedure from the user point of view, they need to mention this.
