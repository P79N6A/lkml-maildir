I am seeing similar errors on my home system.  The interesting thing is that
these errors started occuring only with the development line of kernels.
I would like to be able to track this problem down further.  Is there a way to
force the kernel to display what type of chipset and mode it is using for the
hard drive controller?  I usually use the defaults for the kernel.  (I need to
get the specs on the motherboard for the exact chipset.  It is fairly new for a
Pentium motherboard. The bios is from within the last 3 or so months.)
Thanks!
