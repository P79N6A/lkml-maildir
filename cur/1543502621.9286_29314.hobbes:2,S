Count this as a request to see reiserfs in the 2.3 series too. But...

Anyone running a reasonably high-traffic news server these days threw out
the one-file-per-article storage method a long time ago. It just doesn't
scale to 30-40G per day.
And hobby/low-traffic servers just don't need the extra performance;
traditional, tried-and-true filesystems work fine for them.
