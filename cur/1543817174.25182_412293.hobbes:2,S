ITYM "all".  You've got 2384 non-socket dentries, which is about what I'd
expect on severely pressured busy system...

Looks like that.  Note: /proc/slab_allocators won't help here; all allocations
into that cache are done from sock_alloc_inode(), which is what will be shown.
Not useful...  Moreover, call chain is predictable several steps deeper than
that: sock_alloc_inode() (as ->alloc_inode()) from alloc_inode() from
new_inode() from sock_alloc().
FWIW...  One thing that might be useful here:
a) slab_set_creator(objp, cachep, address): no-op unless DEBUG_SLAB_LEAK set,
void slab_set_creator(void *objp, struct kmem_cache *cachep, void *address)
{
        if (cachep->flags & SLAB_STORE_USER)
                *dbg_userword(cachep, objp) = address;
}
otherwise (has to be function in mm/slab.c; exported).
b)
void slab_charge_here(void *objp, struct kmem_cache *cachep, void *address)
{
	slab_set_creator(objp, cachep, __builtin_return_address(0));
}
in mm/slab.c (exported)
c) #define slab_charge_caller(objp, cachep) \
	slab_set_creator((objp), (cachep), __builtin_return_address(0))
Then we can do the following: in sock_alloc() have
	slab_charge_caller(container_of(inode, struct socket_alloc, vfs_inode),
			   sock_inode_cachep);
and _then_ /proc/slab_allocators will charge these guys to callers of
sock_alloc(); if you'll need to pursue it further, you can always slap
more slab_charge_...() where needed.
