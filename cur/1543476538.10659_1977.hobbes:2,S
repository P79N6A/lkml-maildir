I must have had a bad upgrade on one of the early 5.2 upgrades --- ifconfig 
didn't understand the new /proc/net/dev format.  I just tried it on a recent 
5.2 running 2.1.131 and it worked.

Documentation/Changes is out of date, I think --- recent 2.1 and 2.0.36 both 
support >128M swap areas, but mkswap won't have anything to do with them.

Usually reported as "tar is really slow" (on one of our boxes, it's 
mentioned in /etc/motd as "tar is broken.  use /root/atar" --- I recently 
fixed nsswitch.conf on that box and changed the motd...).
