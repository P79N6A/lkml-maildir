I use a script to build new kernels, and this script controls the 
vmlinuz-version-number-s of the bzImage file copied to /boot when its 
done with the build.  This scripts sets the vmlinuz-x.x.x filename 
correctly:
VER=2.6.2-rc2-mm2
and
cp -f arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-$VER && \
So the vmlinuz is correctly named.
The version number in the makefile is correct:
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 2
EXTRAVERSION =-rc2-mm2
But when the build is all done and rebooted to, uname -a spits this 
out:
Linux coyote.coyote.den 2.6.2-rc2-mm1 #2 Fri Jan 30 11:04:30 EST 2004 
i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux
WTF?
