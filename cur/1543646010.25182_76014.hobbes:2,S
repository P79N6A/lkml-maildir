What's on the lines just before this one from i8042.c?
> I am unable to reproduce this by pressing any single key.  Only by repeatedly pressing many keys, (I.E. bashing the keyboard like mad), does this occur, (and not always with the same scancode).  Very odd.

showkey -s doesn't return true rawmode anymore because of USB keyboards,
etc. So I'll need the dmesg log of these keys pressed.
> The three kana shift keys, (one between alt and the spacebar, and two between alt-gr and the spacebar), which are marked differently to any other Japanese keyboard I've ever seen, all report the keycode 57, and scancode 0x39 when pressed, and scancode 0xb9 when released - the same as the space bar.  Therefore it doesn't seem possible to use them as independent keys.
Again, the dmesg log for these would be more interesting.
