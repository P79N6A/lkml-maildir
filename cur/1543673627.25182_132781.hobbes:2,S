Is there a reason pag_t isn't an unsigned int?  Seems to me you'll have
2^31 good times followed by 2^31 bad times.  Also, isn't signed overflow
one of these undefined things?  I wouldn't mention it except that gcc
seem to be more and more fond of obeying the letter of the standard
rather than doing useful stuff.
