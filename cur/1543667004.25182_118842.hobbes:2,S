You know it, I know it, our readers know it.  But the press puts them
on the same level nevertheless.

I agree completely.  Local security on traditional UNIX-like systems
is *so* poor that this bug doesn't really matter.  No admin of a sane
mind lets untrusted users access important systems.

No, you miss a point.  These exploits are important to keep you kernel
developers honest.  Otherwise, you would have fixed this quitely, like
a couple of other bugs.  Admins would assume that kernels offered a
decent level of local security, which can lead to very questionable
decisions.
