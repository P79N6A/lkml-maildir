Umm... They _call_ it SunOS. Unfortunately it's completely different
system, Missed'em'Vish at it. So Solaris is the only name that is (a) used
by Sun to describe their shame and (b) not misrepresenting the thing. As

would be to go s/8/2000/ and be done with that.
	Al, still bitter about Sun dropping the real thing and switching
to Missed'em'V fecies...
