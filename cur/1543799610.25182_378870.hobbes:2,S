It isn't the case here. (Tho' your question is interesting.)
The case here appears to be:
* Crossmeta offers "add-on" software as a free download from their web
  site: <URL:
http://www.crossmeta.com/downloads/crossmeta-add-1_0.zip>.
  The zip file contains a text file gpl-license.txt, which says that the
  add-ons are offered under the terms of the GPL.
* User downloads this GPLed software and asks the developer to provide
  source code. Developer replies that the source code will be provided
  only to paying customers:
  <URL:
http://www.opensolaris.org/jive/message.jspa?messageID=12277#12277>.
That's baad, m'kay?
