I apologize.  I hadn't meant to send my reply off to the list as a whole.

OK.  For a second there it sounded like you were blowing me off with a
"real-programmer" attitude.  Thus my hot response.  My apologies.

I comment that databases hit the disk a lot.  Database code also tends to
page fault on data a lot, as it's jumping all over the place.
What most commercial databases (Oracle, Sybase, etc) do is exactly what
you're describing, tho- basically write their own OS, including scheduler,
to layer on top of the OS.  This was the whole idea of RawIron a couple of
years back- Oracle basically went "hey, we already have basically a full
OS in our database (including device drivers and memory management)
already- what the heck do we need Solaris for?"
On the other hand, forcing each application to write it's own minature OS
(I/O interface library, scheduling algorithm, etc) strikes me as being a
bad idea.  If the OS has good scheduling, the _only_ advantage user level
threads would have over kernel level threads would be fewer task switchs-
the advantage would be far simpler code in the applications, and less
duplication (and fewer wheels being reinvented badly).  Oracle can afford
to write it's own OS- can MySQL?
