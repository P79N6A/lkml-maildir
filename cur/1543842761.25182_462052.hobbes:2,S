CAP_REG_OPEN and CAP_REG_EXEC might be useful only for demonstration
purposes, but I've *often* wished I could run a program without
CAP_REG_WRITE because I wasn't root and I wanted to make *sure* it
didn't write any file anywhere.  Instead I had to run them from a
user-mode-linux, which is horribly messy and doesn't work well (and,
at best, with a noticeable slowdown).
Again, I ask: is SElinux useable if you aren't root?  (Assuming it's
activated, of course: I mean, can you create new policies to make
certain programs run with restricted privileges?)  I thought it
wasn't, but maybe I'm wrong.
