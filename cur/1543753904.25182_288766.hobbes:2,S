Well, let's concentrate for a moment on the last thing and check later 
if and how they fit into relayfs. Since ltt will be first main user, let's 
optimize it for this.
Also since relayfs is intended for large, fast data transfers, per cpu 
buffers are pretty much always required, so it would make sense to leave 
this to relayfs (less to get wrong for the client).

I have to modify it a little (only the if (!buffer) part is new):
	cpu = get_cpu();
	buffer = relay_get_buffer(chan, cpu);
	while(1) {
		offset = local_add_return(buffer->offset, length);
		if (likely(offset + length <= buffer->size))
			break;
		buffer = relay_switch_buffer(chan, buffer, offset);
		if (!buffer) {
			put_cpu();
			return;
		}
	}
	memcpy(buffer->data + offset, data, length);
	put_cpu();
This has a very short fast path and I need very good reasons to change/add 
anything here. OTOH the slow path with relay_switch_buffer() is less 
critical and still leaves a lot of flexibility.

Look closer, it's already interrupt safe, the synchronization for the 
buffer switch is left to relay_switch_buffer().

Ok, let's take a closer look at the fast path of relay_write (via 
relay_managed.c):
> 	rchan_get(rchan);
This is not needed, it's the responsibility of the client to keep a 
reference to the channel. A synchronize_kernel() is enough to get rid of 
current users of the channel on other cpus.

This adds a conditional and is not really needed. Above shows how to make 
it interrupt safe and if the clients wants to reuse the same buffer, leave 
the locking to the client.

Is this really needed?

You can leave it to caller to check for this, a BUG_ON should be enough 
here.
>	if (rchan->initialized == 0) ...
Does this really have to be in the fast path?
> 	if (in_progress_event_size(rchan)) ...
What's the point of this? You already disable interrupts, so how can 
anything else be in progress?
> 	if (cur_write_pos(rchan) + slot_len > write_limit(rchan)) ...
Ok. This leads to the slow path and not interesting right now.
> 	if (likely(write_pos != NULL)) {
After 7 conditions we finally have a valid write position (and that's 
without ltt).
> 	relay_write_direct(write_pos, data_ptr, count);
If write_pos is just a normal memory pointer, why not also just use 
memcpy?

Hopefully no comment needed.

Same comment as above for in_progress_event_size().

Why is that hook needed here? Why can't this be done by the client?
A buffer switch notification can be done somewhere else.

Same comment as above.
That's quite a lot of code with at least 14 conditions (or 13 conditions 
too much) and this is just relayfs.

That's not always true, where perfomance matters we provide different 
functions (e.g. spinlocks), so having an alternative version of 
relay_write is a possibility (although I'd like to see the user first).
