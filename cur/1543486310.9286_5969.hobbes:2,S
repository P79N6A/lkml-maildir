Duh, I've made the very same mistake several times before: the above does
get rid of aliases, but it's too brute force (it doesn't allow the aliases
in the first place - and we _do_ want to have the aliases in order to get
the ".." thing correct). 
I had a solution for this, and it also handled the vfat alias where you
have multiple names for the same path for non-hardlinked-directory-related
issues (which was why I was thinking of it at first). It just wasn't the
above.
I hope it wasn't a case of me just _thinking_ I had a solution for it. 
I'll go sleep, I'm batting a zero average right now.
