At least for i386 there is no inclusion of elf.h from asm/module.h, and they
are already defines. And a quick grep in the other arches shows no direct
include of elf.h. So removing elf.h from module.h should relieve all
sourcefiles[*] including module.h implicitly including elf.h too, which imho
is a good thing.
[*] find . -name "*.c" | xargs grep "include <linux/module.h>" | wc -l
