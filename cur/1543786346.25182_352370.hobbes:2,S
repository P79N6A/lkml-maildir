Subject: dentry_cache using up all my zone normal memory

I'm running 2.6.10 on a pentium-M system with 3 gig of RAM.  I'm running 
with NFS root, no swap.
Normally at idle I use about 20MB of memory.
When I run LTP everything is fine until it hits the rename14 test. 
Invariably during that test the OOM killer kicks in.
With a bit of digging the culprit appears to be the dentry_cache.  The 
last log I have shows it using 817MB of memory.  Right after that the 
oom killer kicked me off the system.  When I logged back in, the cache 
usage was back down to normal and everything was fine.
Anyone have any suggestions?
Chris
