Hi,

the patch makes sense regardless of whether ide_ioreg_t is int or pointer
type.
OTOH is there any specific reason we must have it as 'char *' on m68k?
The inb,outb macros should be slightly redesigned for m68k, the Q40
has an ISA bus so I need inb() etc to work the same way they work for 
other archs.
Bye
Richard
