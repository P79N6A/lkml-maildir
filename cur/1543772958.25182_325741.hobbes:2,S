 This is highly undesirable if the same interrupt is used for MBEs.  A 
page that causes an excessive number of SBEs should rather be removed from 
the available pool instead.  Logging should probably take recent events 
into account anyway and take care of not overloading the system, e.g. by 
keeping only statistical data instead of detailed information about each 
event under load.

 Note that scrubbing may also be required depending on hardware 
capabilities as data could have been corrected on the fly for the purpose 
of providing a correct value for the bus transaction, but memory may still 
hold corrupted data.
 And of course not all memory is DIMM!

 Note we have some infrastructure for that in the MIPS port -- we kill the 
triggering process, but we don't mark the problematic memory page as 
unusable (which is an area for improvement).  This is of course the case 
for faults occurring synchronously in the user mode -- when in the kernel 
mode or when happening asynchronously (e.g. because of being triggered by 
a DMA transaction rather than one involving a CPU) you often cannot 
determine whether killing a process is good enough for system safety even 
if you are able to narrow the fault down to a potential victim.

 I'd recommend a more generic name rather than "dimm_info" if that is to 
be reused universally.
