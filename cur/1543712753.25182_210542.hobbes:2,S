Andrew, Thanks your comment and response to quickly! Will make changes
as you suggested.

I thought that just using ext3_find_next_zero_bit probably would be okey
since, once we get a reservation window that has a possible free block, 
the ext3_try_to_allocate will check both the block group bitmap and the
copy of last committed bitb inside that window range anyway before doing
the real allocation. If there is no really free block on both bitmaps,
ext3_try_to_allocate will fail and will looking for a new reservation
window.  
But as Andrew said, this may cause unnecessary calling
ext3_try_to_allocate() many many times...
We could do the same thing as in find_next_usable_block(): 
/*
 * The bitmap search --- search forward alternately through the actual
 * bitmap and the last-committed copy until we find a bit free in
 * both
 */
  while (here < maxblocks) {
          next = ext3_find_next_zero_bit(bh->b_data, maxblocks, here);
          if (next >= maxblocks)
                  return -1;
         if (ext3_test_allocatable(next, bh))
                 return next;
         jbd_lock_bh_state(bh);
         if (jh->b_committed_data)
         here =
	ext3_find_next_zero_bit(jh->b_committed_data,                                                        maxblocks, next);
        jbd_unlock_bh_state(bh);
 }
Maybe make this a inline function....ext2 does not need to care about
the journalling stuff.

Haven't got a chance to verify that but good point. Will do.

Only some files need to keep reservation cross file open/close, for
those that opened with append flag, or some file like /var/log while
multiple processes frequently open/write/close/. Maybe a file attribute
or a open flag could be used for this purpose.  For regular files, I
think the files should discard at close. Untar a kernel tree just did
open files with WRITE then write and close.

Thanks again.
