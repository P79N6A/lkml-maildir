sob.  How about updating the nice comment rather than removing it?

Here.   Some description of the difference between these two, and why one
would call one and not the other.
I'd be rather interested in reading that comment because afaict,
get_global_vm_events() has no callers.
And nor should it, please.  It has potential to be seriously inefficient. 
Much, much better to kill this function and to implement a CPU hotplug
notifier to spill the going-away CPU's stats into another CPU's
accumulators.
