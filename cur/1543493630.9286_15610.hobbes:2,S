it means two things:
a) you are using old version of Red Hat. Upgrade to 5.9 asap.
b) you are using whatever defaults they give you. Don't do that. Always
configure your networking manually (by editing files in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts) and compile your kernel manually.
More specifically, it means you are using a module where you should really
be using a monolithic kernel. I.e. if that network interface is always in
use it is silly to use it as a module (and thus waste an entry in TLB
cache). You ought to compile the kernel and mark the corresponding network
driver for static linking into the kernel.
It is *not* Red Hat's fault because they cannot possibly guess what
network card you are likely to have. So they prepare things in a minimal
manner so that they just work (some strange humans are happy if things
"just work") but it is your responsibility to do things properly after the
installation.
