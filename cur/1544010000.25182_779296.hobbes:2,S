Ah, but that's different.  Take a look at that warning and think _why_
it is given and what is it about.  Getting an untrusted string as
format argument is a real security hole, but it has nothing to do
with a pile of cases in your patch.
FWIW, even in this case (where the warning is a false positive, BTW -
the string passed there can have one of two values and both are safe)
I would simply do
	switch(...) {
	case .... : request_module("snd-seq"); break;
	case .... : request_module("snd-timer"); break;
	}
and that's it.
Slapping "%s" here actually obfuscates the code, without making it safer.
