Harvey,
You sent in three patches, video/ , common/ , and dvb/ ... but these
patches are way too large.
Please break these down by each level of the directory tree hierarchy,
like I asked previously.
Make one patch for files inside media/video/*.[ch]
make one patch for files inside media/video/cx88/*.[ch]
make one patch for files inside media/video/saa7134/*.[ch]
[...]
make one patch for files inside media/dvb/b2c2/*.[ch]
make one patch for files inside media/dvb/frontends/*.[ch]
[...]
etc.
