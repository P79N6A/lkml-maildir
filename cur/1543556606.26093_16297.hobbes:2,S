Jeff,
Have you also seen this applied where it is to the employer's
disadvantage?  For example, given that I looked at and worked
with GPL code (say Linux kernel) in University before taking
employment as a programmer that the employer's product is
inevitably contaiminated and no longer a trade secret?  Can
a previous employee get an injunction against their former
employer to cease and desist from using this negative knowledge?
If so, I might have a solution: make the Linux kernel required
reading in University programming classes!
