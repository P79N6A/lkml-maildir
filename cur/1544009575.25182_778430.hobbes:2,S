Hi Bjorn,
How about one of these options:
1.) Modify acpi_bus_set_power() to return success if the device is not power
manageable but the request is for D0.  After all, any device that doesn't
support PM can be assumed to be in D0. (Or maybe more correctly the state
of its parent?)
2.) Call acpi_bus_get_power() and check if the state is not already D0 before
asking acpi_bus_set_power() for the transition.  If it is any other 
state, then
of the device is power manageable.
Thanks,
Adam
