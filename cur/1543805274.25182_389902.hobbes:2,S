Hi,
mm3 is basically running ok, however it has one problem (that ocurs in mm2, 
too):
My Netbeans (java-ide) debugger is to slow. It takes some ms (up to 1000 I'd 
think) to step over one line, in 13-rc2-mm1 I cannot realize a delay at all.
Any Idea how to profile the kernel/my system to get an Idea. Everything else 
(C, C++, java apps..) are running fine.
regards
Alex
