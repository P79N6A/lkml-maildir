OK, so there is the root cause.  It's time to talk about duplicate changes.
You know how Linus hates bad csets in the history and doesn't want them
there?  Well, I hate duplicate csets and don't want them there.  There are
lots of reasons.  One reason is that it means revtool is a lot less useful
for debugging.  If you are trying to track down the change which caused a
bug but it is obscured by a duplicate patch, you just got hosed.  Another
reason is file creates.  Suppose you and Marcelo both created a file called
"foo".  You pull, there is a file conflict, you remove one of the two files.
It isn't actually removed, it's just moved to BitKeeper/deleted.  Time passes
and you or someone else is fixing bugs in a pre-merged copy of the tree and
you are updating "foo".  You later pull that bugfix into the merged tree
and the bugfix happily is applied to the *deleted* copy of the file, since
the changes follow the "inode", not the pathname.  Bummer, you are now
scratching your head wondering where your bugfix went.
There are things we can do in BK to deal with this, but they are not easy
and are going to take several months, is my guess.  I'd like to see if you
can work around this by avoiding duplicate patches.  If you can, do so, 
you will save yourself lots of grief.
If you get into a duplicate patch situation, you are far better off to 
pick one tree or the other tree as the official tree, and cherrypick
the changes that the unofficial tree has and place them in the official
tree.  Then toss the unofficial tree.  I can make you a "bk portpatch"
command which does this, we have that already, it needs a bit of updating
to catch the comments.
You really want to listen to this, I'm trying to head you off from screwing
up the history.  If you get 300 renames like this, it's almost always a 
duplicate patch scenario.
