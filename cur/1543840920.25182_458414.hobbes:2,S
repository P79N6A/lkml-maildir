There is a lot of weirdness in this code; it's broken in an enormous 
amount of ways (sorry, Matt).  This comment, for example:
	pushl	%esi
     	cmpl	$0, %cs:cmd_line_ptr
	jz	done_cl
	movl	%cs:(cmd_line_ptr), %esi
# ds:esi has the pointer to the command line now
... doesn't handle the old boot protocol, and doesn't at all deal with 
the fact that cmd_line_ptr is an absolute address, and not at all 
relative to SETUPSEG, which is the normal value for %ds at this point. 
For the old protocol, this is a 16-bit pointer which is relative to 
INITSEG (not SETUPSEG), but this code just completely ignores it.
I'll hack up a patch for this.
