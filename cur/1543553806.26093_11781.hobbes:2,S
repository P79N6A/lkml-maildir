Linux lists implementation stores linking informations directly inside the
block of data We're going to link.
This has the advantage that no extra list nodes are allocated to store the data
pointer but has the drawback that if We've to link the same data to more than
one list We've to declare more than one listhead.
See at the different links We've inside the task_struct for example.
