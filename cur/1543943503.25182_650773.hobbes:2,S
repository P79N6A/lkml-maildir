Yep, also I think that if kmalloc is possible it would better than the
operator new.
Rohit,
Compiling the kernel module with g++ is not a simple work, you may
need big patch for kernel itself.
The c++ has more internal keywords than c.
e.g) new, delete, and ::
The new and delete should be re-spelled with another names.
The '::' is used in inline assembly however in c++ it means global namespace.
In conclusion, I don't recommand c++ for linux kernel without very
special goal like the click project :)
