Correct. SMP was perfect LIFO even without Andrea's changes.
I thought Andrea tried to reduce the fragmentation, therefore I wrote
"free is free".
But even for cache re-use his changes are not a big change: The main
fifo/lifo ordering on UP is mandated by the defragmentation property of
the slab allocator. 
Afaics there is exactly one case where my code is not lifo and Andrea's
is: kmem_cache_free frees the last object in slab, each slab contains
more than one object, and there are no further partial slabs.
In all other cases Andrea just adds list_del();list_add() instead of 
changes to the firstnotfull pointer.
full->partial is/was lifo,
partial->partial doesn't change the lists at all
partial->empty was fifo, is now lifo_if_no_partial_slab_exists
