Well thats good news.  In response to the comments made about testing
the impact of these patches on big-iron I was going to suggest we ask
Andrew to include your patch set in -mm so that it firstly gets at least
compiled on big-iron, and secondly so we could think about how to test
with some of the options enabled on big-iron.
Knowing nothing about these options, from a test perspective it would
be nice if we were able to simply enable "the lot" so we can do "normal"
-mm runs and "tiny" -mm runs without any manual intervention?
