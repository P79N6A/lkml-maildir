Hi,
I have notebook Acer TravelMate 242X with CD-ROM drive
Mitsumi SR244W1
hdc: SR244W1, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
When I call eject /dev/hdc I gets:
# eject /dev/hdc
eject: unable to eject, last error: Invalid argument
I can eject it by pressing button, but after mount I can work with drive, but 
I can't umount or eject it! and only reboot work to remove CD disk from drive 
by pressing button on drive.
Under WinXP everithing works OK
Thanks for your help
Michal
