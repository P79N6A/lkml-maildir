 You do.  PCI-space registers are volatile and they may change depending
on what was written (or read) previously.  A memory barrier before a PCI
read will ensure you get a value that is relevant to previous code
actions.  Without a barrier you may get pretty anything, depending on
which of previous writes managed to complete before.
