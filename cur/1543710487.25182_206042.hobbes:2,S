Hi!
I don't really like having two implementations of same code in
kernel. There are two ways to deal with it:
* remove pmdisk from kernel
  + its easy
* remove swsusp from kernel, rename pmdisk to swsusp, fix all bugs
  that were fixed in swsusp but not in pmdisk 
  + people seem to like pmdisk code more
  - will need some testing in -mm series
Which one do you prefer? I can do both...
