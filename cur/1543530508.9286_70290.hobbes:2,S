Hi,
I almost have the patch done, give me a few hours (not to do the patch,
but until I get off work.)
About the D-Link device, could you send me (or the linux-usb list) the
output of the /proc/bus/net/devices file when this device is plugged in?
The D-Link device is not currently supported by the current driver,
although I have talked to them a while ago, and I think some is
currently trying to get the specs of their devices so a driver can
be written.
Thanks,
greg k-h
