Yeah, there is an EC-related regression in 2.6.25-rc3 that bites your
thinkpad.  I don't have a link to it right now, but if you look for the
messages to LKML on the last 48h, you will find it.

Don't do this.  Just let the driver select the default mask, unless you
*really* know better.

It wouldn't fix any EC issues.  If you just revert the
6c231bd5eb07ce546517019f334652b9ecfc329a commit entirely (note, I don't mean
revert TO THE COMMIT), by doing something like this:
git checkout v2.6.25-rc3
git show 6c231bd5eb07ce546517019f334652b9ecfc329a | patch -p1 -R
Does it fix anything ?
