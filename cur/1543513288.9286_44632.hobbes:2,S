	You should look at any of PCI bus-master Ethernet cards,
	which have exactly the same problemset.

	Perhaps you want 'GFP_DMA32' allocations ?
	And if the buffer isn't in appropriate area, non-irq-space
	part of your driver must copy things over into appropriate
	area for transmit.
	Such allocation space does not exist, though...
	Do you *really* have more than 1 or 2 GB RAM at your box ?

	No, data waiting for transmit won't be pulled away before
	your driver gives a permission for it.  You are implying
	of giving that permission too early..
