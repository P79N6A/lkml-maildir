Ah.  No, we don't account that.  That would be "minor faults
against pagecache".

Yes, it is.  "page reclaim"

It's a bit hard to put one's finger on what this means
really.  We have the free-pages info in /proc/meminfo,
and the page-stealing rates in /proc/meminfo.
If we see that kswapd is stealing pages like mad then we
know there's a lot of replacement pressure, but that certainly
doesn't mean that the system is under any sort of difficulty.
I guess one should step back and ask "what are we trying to
report here"?

That's approximately /proc/meminfo:Committed_AS / total memory.

Yes, I have a fix for that queued.
pgfree will include freeings from programs exitting, munmapping,
truncating, etc.  I think it's not a very interesting metric
for system behaviour.
/proc/vmstat:pgsteal is more interesting.  It shows the rate
at which the kernel is reclaiming cache (pagecache and swapcache)
to satisfy its memory demands.

OK.  /proc/vmstat:pgscan is incremented when the VM considers
a page for replacement.  You can divide this by Active+Inactive
from meminfo to determine the scanning rate.
Also, pgscan/pgsteal is a metric of the efficiency of page
reclaim.  If it's 1.00 then every page coming off the tail of
the inactive list is being reaped.  If it gets much below 0.3
or so then the VM is having quite some difficulty.

Looks like it, yes.

I guess this should include:
- Pages in use by the kernel (kmalloc, kernel stacks etc).
  (These are mostly accounted for in /proc/meminfo:Slab)
- Pages which are mlocked (there is no accounting of these at all)
- PageReserved pages
- Not much else, really.  Maybe pages which are under direct-IO.
PageReserved accounting is simple enough, but it looks like the
problem which needed that metric can be solved by other means.
mlock accounting is tricky, and without that the value of this is a 
bit questionable.

I like anything which improves the observability of kernel
behaviour ;)
