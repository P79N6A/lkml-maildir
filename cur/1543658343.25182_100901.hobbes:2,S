Subject: PATCH: module_text_address() defined but not used in module.h

module_text_address() is defined as 'static int ...' if modules are
not configured in in module.h, leading to a compiler warning that it
is defined but not used. Make it static inline. Patch against
2.5.54-bk.

my opinions may seem crazy. But they all make sense. Insane sense, but
sense nontheless. -- Shlomi Fish on #offtopic.
