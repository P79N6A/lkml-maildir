I really don't care what it's called, as long as it's descriptive.
/proc/meminfo is taken.  :-)
One idea would follow the concept of /proc/bus/ and have /proc/memory/
with different memory types.  /proc/memory/dimm0 /proc/memory/dimm1
/proc/memory/flash0 .

Part tracking info and configuration info.  For example, we were doing
some experiments to determine the relationship between refresh rates
and memory errors.  Could increasing the refresh rate reduce the number
of memory errors, therefor making memory more reliable for customers?
Could decreasing the refresh rate in manufacturing be used to identify
questionable DIMMs?  Having a convient interface to read the current
refresh rate setting and write a new setting would be useful.
This type info, not necessarily in this format:
