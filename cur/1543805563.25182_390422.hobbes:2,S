That's why I said that sysfs/hotplug are kernel interfaces. They are the
interfaces the kernel uses to tell the rest of the system what devices
are there.
They are by no means interfaces that common tools should use.

Yes. That is something that can be fixed, though. It's some work, but
it's just that - no controversies involved.

That's what LSB and other standards are for. Defining standard
filesystem layout for programs to use (this includes /dev !).
And that's what also distros are for - setting correct defaults in the
programs when they package them.
In the end, on a well done distribution it works. And some time after
one is created, the distributions do follow the standard, too.

It's mostly required if you run GNOME or KDE, so for desktop
applications it makes perfect sense.
