Yes it's in fact exactly the same as ~cpu_isolated_map in the patches that I 
sent out earlier.

Sure. We can just update readme from my patch to use cpuset instead of 
/sys/system/cpu/cpu1/isolated bits. If we go with this approach that is.

Makes sense to me too. ie cpus_system is more descriptive.

Good point.

Ok so you did not like the 'isolated' name too ;-).
