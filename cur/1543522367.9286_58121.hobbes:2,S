But what to do if you are found server who are relays but fall into "Unknown"
status due blocking on router ? You should mark them. By hand. Otherwise every
spammer will use blocked servers and ORBS become useless (and yes, I know quite
a few sysadmins who tried to fool ORBS instead of fixing relay problem till
I showed him what the end result will be). Problem is that you can not find
correct border for netblock (and even worse: you can not easily pull out
one address from netblock and do not mark it with netblock due DNS nature).
So ORBS created .ok.orbs.org. instead. Hmm. I should (and will) use .ok.orbs.org.
before .relays.orbs.org. but I doubt why it's not used in examples ???

As Cox's said it's DNS nature :-/ Since there are EXIST "list of exceptions"
*.ok.orbs.org. the only question remains: "why it's not used in samples" ?

If you will not punish admins of "Unknown" systems noone will fix relays - they
will just block ORBS and go in "Unknown" state. Of course sometimes you'll
punish innocent systems :-( It's life as it is. What I can not understood is
other thing: if there are exist "exceptions list" already why it's not used ?
 B> It doesn't matter.  Compliant servers should NOT be blocked.
But it's only partially ORBS fault :-) Examples are there but it's mere
examples. I was one who used ORBS database in sendmail.cf. And used it
wrongly :-(

There are NO WAY to find out where segment border is. Since your host is not
blocked (and thus listed in .ok.orbs.org.) ORBS done what they can. It's not
easy to remove just one host from netblock by DNS nature so they created
"exceptions list" instead. Looks like bright move to me. What's not so bright
is silence in which such "exceptions list" is created :-((
