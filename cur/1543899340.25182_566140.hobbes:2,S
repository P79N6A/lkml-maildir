As far as I understand, it is a ramfs aka. non-swappable tmpfs without any 
limit and including a chance of DoSing the system.
Since I'm toying with root-on-initcpio, I'm looking for things that might 
make the task some easier.
Currently I'm thinking about changing the root=initramfs to root=tmpfs and
additionally mounting a tmpfs on / before unpacking the cpios. OTOH, this 
seems to be a little bit messy. OTOH again, in _that_ boot code, nobody
should complain :)
