That reminds me of something I forgot to mention in my original message.
I filed this in Red Hat Bugzilla (#117682), and Arjan van de Ven
mentioned the likely cause. I then confirmed it and coded up my patch.
So, Arjan deserves credit too. I meant to mention this in my original
e-mail, but I accidentally forgot. Sorry about that.
