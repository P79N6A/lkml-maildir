Hotfixes are something that can be done.
What you suggest is not really possible.
Your thinko is:
3 new patches a day don't sum up to 3 MB after one week.
As far as I understand it, the big work for Andrew is integrating two 
dozen git repositories and at about thousand patches in a way that:
- everything applies
- the kernel compiles on several architectures
- the kernel actually runs on some machines
Andrew does all this before he releases an -mm kernel (I know due to the 
feedback he sometimes gives for patches I sent), and this is the sole 
reason why most -mm kernels are half-way usable.
Some random snapshot from Andrew's repository wouldn't help anyone, 
either it's good enough that he releases an -mm kernel or it isn't worth 
other people testing it.
