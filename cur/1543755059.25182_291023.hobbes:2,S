The problem is that users wouldn't be happy if I passed USB usage codes
when they enable raw mode with an USB keyboard.
The expectation is that 'it will work'.
Because of that, the 'softraw=0' option _only_ works for AT and PS/2
keyboards, with any other keyboard type it has no effect.

To have all keyboard types behave the same, instead of having a single
exception, although I admit that the exception would be for the most
common case.

The emulated rawmode is there mainly for X. If it weren't for X, I
wouldn't bother generating rawmode for keyboards other than PS/2, and
for PS/2 I'd have kept the true raw data there.
However, on 2.6, where you can have more than one keyboard, it'd be
better to use the EVIOCSKEYCODE ioctl on the event device instead of the
KDSKEYCODE ioctl on the console, as the later only changes the first
found keyboard.
Also, if setkeycodes used the event device, it'd get the raw scancodes
easily, as they're embedded in the event stream together with the
keycodes.
I'd hoped someone of the lineak/.../... multimedia key people will make
such an utility, but now I see that what one doesn't do himself, doesn't
happen. I will write it, possibly as a patch to setkeycodes.

It indeed is. It's been removed, too.
