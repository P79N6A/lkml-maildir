2.6.16.x is still maintained (2.6.16.60 was recently released).
2.6.22.x is still maintained but Greg KH is apparently going to be
ending his duties on it after the next release or so.  There is some
confusion as to whether Willy Tarreau will be taking on the 2.6.22.x
tree once Greg is done, Willy?:

2.6.23.x and 2.6.24.x are obviously quite active for stable@kernel.org
