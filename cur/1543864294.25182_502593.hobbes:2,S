Oh, I hope I didn't give the impression I wanted it in the kernel (that 
is why i labeled it as SCRIPT and not PATCH), as you said it is a 
userspace problem. I just thought a simple script to remove those 
whitespace could help in an imperfect world. I prefer kate since then 
you can see where the tabs begins (and other features).
