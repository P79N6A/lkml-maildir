I'm not sure about that, it appears that the number of controllers that 
have problems is much lower than the number that don't, so this would 
just need to be added to almost every driver. Especially since the 
non-NCQ FUA which was problematic on SiI in the past isn't being 
switched on by default.

On the NCQ side, I think it's pretty safe to assume that all controllers 
will handle it. Obviously I've verified it with sata_nv (at least that 
it doesn't blow up obviously), and the other two NCQ drivers we have, 
ahci and sata_sil24 just feed raw FIS data into the controller so there 
should be no issue with not supporting it.
Assuming that we leave FUA off by default for non-NCQ for the 
foreseeable future, is there really much concern here?

Will do shortly. Eric, do you have any info on the blacklisting of that 
Maxtor 7B250S0 drive? I would hope that Silicon Image would have a good 
reason for blacklisting that one..
