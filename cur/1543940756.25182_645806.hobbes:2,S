Apparently not to the original poster. And some Apple x86 users might 
also disagree.
On x86-64 BTW while they could still rely on end_pfn_mapped and
it being direct mapped Venki's PAT patchkit removes that so ioremap
would be needed there too

If there is no direct mapping what page tables should they change?
Surely you're not suggesting they should walk all vmalloc areas and switch
them over. I don't think this is correct.
