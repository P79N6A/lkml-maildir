This is necessary here because of this:

/home/andrea/bin/x86_64/python/bin/python
Of course I've /home/andrea/bin/x86_64/python/bin in the path before
/usr/bin.
The generally accepted way to start it is through env, other scripts in
mercurial were already getting that right too so it was probably not
intentional to hardcode it in the hg binary.
