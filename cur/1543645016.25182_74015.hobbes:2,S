I looked at this patch again, and it makes no sense.
It would simply sum the unrelated IRQ % IRQvec irqs into a meaningless number.
If you don't want the space taken up in kstat, then you should expand on the
three ifdefs to something like this:
< #if !define(CONFIG_ARCH_S390) 
--
> #if !define(CONFIG_ARCH_S390) && !defined(CONFIG_YOUR_BIG_NUMA)
PS: sparc and sparc64 appear to have sparse irq space too: see __irq_itoa
