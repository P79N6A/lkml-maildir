What is the current wisdom on SA_INTERRUPT?
A comment in signal.h about it says "dummy -- ignored".  Elsewhere it says
that "SA_INTERRUPT is a no-op left for historical reasons".
That certainly doesn't seem to be the case in irq.c.  It appears to be used
like this: if SA_INTERRUPT isn't set, enable interrupts during interrupt
handling.
So what is this flag for?  How, when, and why should it be used?
Thanks.
Regards,
Brad
