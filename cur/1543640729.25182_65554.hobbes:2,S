And how would you see this. On a diskless/headless system, you'll be 
sure to find more than one NIC, making it IMHO very unlikely for one 
attacker to be able to generate so much traffic on all of those that all 
NICs are continuesly generating interrupts. Granted, it's not the best 
source of entropy, but it's guanranteed to be more that /dev/zero. 
Having your network cards in your entropy pool, is not really bad, and 
is a lot better than not being able to generate session keys at all for 
your ssh connection.
