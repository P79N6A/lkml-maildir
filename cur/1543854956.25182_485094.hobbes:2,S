Heh, I would think that it's a big "obvious", oh well.
There are 2 changes in this patch.
First one is to ensure that the kobject is properly initialized _before_
kobject_init() is called.  Yeah, seems funny, right?  Turns out this has
caught a lot of issues where kobject_init() is called twice on the same
object, not a good thing at all.
And this looks like that is exactly what is happening here, as you
mention:
> Perhaps mce_remove_device() isn't being called.
That's probably the issue.
The second change in that patch tries to enforce the "everything needs a
release() function" rule for kobjects, but it turns out, a lot of static
kobjects trigger this inproperly (struct bus and friends), so that can't
go to mainline, and it only shows up if you enable CONFIG_KOBJECT_DEBUG.
Hope this helps explain things, I'll go off and edit the text there to
make it clearer.
thanks,
greg k-h
