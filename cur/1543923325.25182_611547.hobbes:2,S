Subject: build failure, missing libvdeplug.h?

Building uml with an allyesconfig and a few changes in UML only fails with:
...
  CC      arch/um/drivers/vde_user.o
/home/roel/dnld/src/kernel/git/linux-2.6/arch/um/drivers/vde_user.c:8:24: error: libvdeplug.h: No such file or directory
/home/roel/dnld/src/kernel/git/linux-2.6/arch/um/drivers/vde_user.c: In function 'vde_user_init':
/home/roel/dnld/src/kernel/git/linux-2.6/arch/um/drivers/vde_user.c:18: error: 'VDECONN' undeclared (first use in this function)
...
the file libvdeplug.h is missing and I can't find it neither in the tree or on
the net. 'git-grep VDECONN' shows that VDECONN isn't defined anywhere.

There is a reference to 
http://wiki.virtualsquare.org/index.php/Main_Page
 in
the Kconfig (also added by this commit).
After reverting this commit the build continues. possibly the header 
libvdeplug.h was forgotten?
