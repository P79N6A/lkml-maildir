Just to clarify here - you're saying that some older kernel is as sucky as
2.6.21, and that (presumably) dropping the dirty ratios makes things a bit
better on the old kernel as well?

Yes, the very full disk could explain why things are _so_ bad.  Not only
does fsync() force vast amounts of writeout, it's also seeky writeout.

Well, physical journalling with ordered data is bad here.  Other forms of
journalling which don't introduce this great contention point shouldn't be
as bad.
Actually, I'm surprised that data=writeback didn't help much.  If the
present theories are correct it should have helped quite a lot, because in
data=writeback mode fsync(small-file) will not cause
fdatasync(everything-else).
