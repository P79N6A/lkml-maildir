Anthony, are you certain that this was the only VM dump available? 
AFAICS the only possible explanation for a OOM kill manifestation under 
this conditions (free pages count in the normal zone is higher than 
its high watermark + lowmem reservation), is a higher order allocation.
Why the heck doesnt the OOM killer print the order of current allocation? 
Anyway, the current try_to_free_pages/alloc_pages interaction seem to 
continue susceptible to deliberate decisions, even after Nick changed
the algorithm to return success if the total count of reclaimed pages
is greater than SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX, instead of a single priority pass 
being greater than SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX.
It sounds to me that a more reliable indication of OOM is failure to 
free _any_ pages after a full priority decay.
Nick, Andrew?
