Quick report: 2.2.1 was running very well on a Pentium UP (uptime 20 days).
When I installed 2.2.2, some processes stayed forever in 'D' status.
*Maybe* all of those where trying to comminicate with the SCSI CDROM
("wmrack -mixer" from AfterStep and "mount /dev/cdrom ...").
Will elaborate when and if I have more details...
