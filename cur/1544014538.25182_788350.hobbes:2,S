You're right, i_size can change without you knowing about it, but before
vmtruncate does anything to the page itself, it locks the page.
So, we tend to do a somewhat racey check against i_size.  If the page is
outside i_size, we happily ignore it.  If it is inside i_size, we assume
it is part of the file.  Most of the code that does this checks i_size
once after locking the page and saves that value, so if i_size changes
later on the code at least does consistent operations based on a single
value of i_size.
If the page straddles i_size and someone extends the file, they are
expected to lock the page as well (see block_truncate_page and the
places it gets called).
