Subject: [PATCH] make sscanf honor %n at end of input string
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I was playing with some code that sometimes got a string where a %n
match should have been done where the input string ended, for example
like this:
  sscanf("abc123", "abc%d%n", &a, &n);
However, the scanf function in the kernel doesn't convert the %n in that
case because it has already matched the complete input after %d. This
patch changes that.

Shrug. My use case for this collapsed, but I figured having scanf doing
that correctly might be a good thing.
