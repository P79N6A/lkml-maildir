Linus,
Thanks for the clarification !
So as I suspected and validated via other means, the content of the
headers are not an issue as it relates to GPL as many claim.
Well I have gotten side requests that I was late in joining the thread
party and I am distracting you from patch merging.  This is a fair point,
and we can restart after 2.6.0 is out.
Cheers,
