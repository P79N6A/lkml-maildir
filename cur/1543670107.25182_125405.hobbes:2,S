Those functions are not used at the moment, but I could change that.
The question remains why DMA transfers are so slow.  The memory is
clearly visible from the bus.
Btw, I just noticed that hard disk throughput is much lower with 2.5
than 2.4.  With 2.4.21-pre5 I get ~40 MB/s, but with 2.5.67 the speed
drops to 25-30 MB/s.  Everything according to hdparm.  Is it possible
that DMA is generally slow for some reason?
