in this case wouldn't it be trivial to write a 'null transport' driver 
that just passed things down to the card to let the firmware deal with it?
(reformatting the data if needed)
having a null driver for a layer for some hardware, and a much more 
complex driver for the same layer for other hardware is fairly common in 
Linux. I believe ti was Linus that said in an interview that Linux is now 
largely designed for an ideal abstracted CPU, with code put in on the 
architectures that don't have a feature to simulate that feature in 
software.
