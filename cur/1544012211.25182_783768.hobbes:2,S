Cool, so the CFLAGS_REMOVE solution worked.
I'm the last one to criticize someones language, especially when it is not 
their native tongue. The closest language outside of English that I know 
is German, and I would do horrible if I had to write this in German. Heck, 
my English sucks too ;-)
But since this is going to be a public record of what you changed, it 
should be a bit more clear.

Again, I'm still impressed by your ability to communicate in a language 
other than your own. And perhaps my corrections are incorrect too ;-)
