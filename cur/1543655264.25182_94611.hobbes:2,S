If you really want you can cheat that 100% statistic into something much
lower by zeroing the page from back to front (based on the exact
faulting address even, because you know THAT one will get used) and/or
zeroing the second half while bypassing the cache. At least it's 50%
hits then ;)
Still not 100% and I still agree that the 8Kb number is much nicer for
16Kb L1 cache machines....
