Subject: [BUG]: agpgart for i810 chipsets broken in 2.5.51

Hi,
1.  Agpgart is broken for i810, and perhaps some of the i815 family. The
following lines (linux/drivers/char/agp/backend.c:120)
	cap_ptr = pci_find_capability(dev, PCI_CAP_ID_AGP);
	if (cap_ptr == 0) <--- /* always 0 for the i810 */
		return -ENODEV;
	agp_bridge.capndx = cap_ptr;
will always fail because they really don't have AGP.  Commenting them
out in my case correctly initializes the gart.
2.  The i810 driver for Xfree86 will also fail to load because of
version mismatch (0.99 vs 1.0).  Rolling back the version corrects the
problem.
No patches because I don't want to uglify the code :-)
