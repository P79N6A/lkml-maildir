In the long term I'd like us to be able to compile the whole (or at 
least most of) the kernel with one "-combine -fwhole-program" gcc call 
which should bring the same positive effect plus enables gcc to do 
additional optimizations.
That's meant as a remark, not against your patch (which is for a lower 
hanging fruit).
