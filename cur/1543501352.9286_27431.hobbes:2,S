So, another question -- WHY isn't tasklist_lock exported to modules?  If a 
module were to iterate through all the tasks, wouldn't it need to use 
read_(un)lock(tasklist_lock)?  Or should I just loop through the tasks 
without locking?  I don't want to cause any problems with SMP mahcines here.
again, please CC to me.  thanks.
