Does anybody know if PLIP works on a thinkpad 560E. I can't get it to!
I am using 2.4.10.
The packets are received, but the sending seems to fail:
Logs:

          TX packets:0 errors:42 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:42
          collisions:0 compressed:0 txqueuelen:10          
I have the parallel port set to ECP. I have tried reversing the
connection wire!
Any suggestions? It has been suggested/mentioned that the port is butchered in
some way and won't do plip. Is this true? Does anyone know the detail?
Thanks,
Mark
