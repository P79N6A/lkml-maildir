I'm currently sending this message while running the kernel with this
patch.  But I haven't compiled with RT_DEADLOCK_DETECT. Instead I'm
recompiling with my changes to turn on all TRACE_{WARN,BUG} to be real
WARN and BUG without the deadlock detect code.  This way I can run it
without the trace_lock helping.
