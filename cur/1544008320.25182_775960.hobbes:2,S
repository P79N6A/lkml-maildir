Well, this is a case of media corruption (or a cosmic ray hitting
hitting a ribbon cable in the disk controller sending the write to the
wrong location on disk, or someone bumping the server causing the disk
head to lift up a little higher than normal while it was writing the
disk sector, etc.).  But it is a case of the hard drive misbehaving. 
Heck, if you have a hiccup while writing an inode table block out to
disk (for example a power failure at just the wrong time), so the
memory (which is more voltage sensitive than hard drives) DMA's
garbage which gets written to the inode table, you could lose a large
number of adjacent inodes when garbage gets splatted over the inode
table.
Ext3 tends to recover from this better than other filesystems, thanks
to the fact that it does physical block journalling, but you do pay
for this in terms of performance if you have a metadata-intensive
workload, because you're writing more bytes to the journal for each
metadata opeation.

There are certainly things you can do.  Put your fileservers's on
UPS's.  Use RAID.  Make backups.   Do all three.  :-)
