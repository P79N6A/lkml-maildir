I had to choose between helping other architectures to convert and
rewriting the core code to speed everything up.  I chose to get other
architectures converted, finding some interesting "features" at the
same time.
The core code is stable and I will not change it right now, I want
stable code to go to Linus.  Once Linus takes kbuild 2.5 then I can
start on the rewrite, without affecting anybody else.
