That's quite an old kernel.  If this is the notorious bio-uses-GFP_DMA bug
then I'd have expected this kernel to be useless from day one.  Did you
install it recently?

Yes, I expect it's the same still-unfixed bug.
If you're feeling keen you could add this patch which would confirm it:
--- devel/mm/oom_kill.c~a	2006-03-02 01:16:17.000000000 -0800
+++ devel-akpm/mm/oom_kill.c	2006-03-02 01:16:32.000000000 -0800
@@ -258,6 +258,8 @@ void out_of_memory(unsigned int __nocast
 	struct mm_struct *mm = NULL;
 	task_t * p;
 
+	dump_stack();

 	read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
 retry:
 	p = select_bad_process();

And if it's that bug then I'm afraid you'll have to sit tight until 2.6.16.
We shouldn't release 2.6.16 until this thing is fixed.
