D-cache incoherence with unsuitably aligned multiple MAP_FIXED
mappings is also observed on SH4, SH5, PA-RISC 1.1d.  The kernel may
have the same behaviour on those platforms: allowing a mapping that
should not be allowed.
On some ARM and m68k boxes, incoherence is observed independent of
alignment, for multiple mappings of a page in the same user memory
space.
