Ah, but it's ACKed correctly right below it...:

...segment below snd_una arrived => snd_una remains 18464, receiver 
generates a duplicate ACK:

The cumulative ACK field of it covers _everything_ below 18464 (i.e., it 
ACKs them), including the 1448 bytes in 12408:13856... In addition, the 
SACK block is DSACK information [RFC2883] telling explicitly the address 
of the received duplicate block. However, if this ACK doesn't reach the 
SERVER TCP, RTO is triggered and the first not yet cumulatively ACKed 
segment is retransmitted (I guess cumulative ACKs up to 12408 arrived 
without problems to the SERVER):

Yeah, firewall or some other issue, I'd say it's quite unlikely a bug in 
TCP because behavior to both directions indicate client -> sender 
blackhole independently of each other...
