Well, even if you did the write-back if VM_MAYWRITE is set, you'd still
have the case of having MAP_SHARED, PROT_READ _without_ VM_MAYWRITE being
set, and I'd expect that to actually be the common one (since you'd
normally use O_RDONLY to open a fd that you only want to map for reading).
And as mentioned, MAP_SHARED+PROT_READ does actually happen in real life.  
Just do a google search on "MAP_SHARED PROT_READ -PROT_WRITE" and you'll
get tons of hits. For good reason too - because MAP_PRIVATE isn't actually
coherent on several old UNIXes.
So you'd still have to convert such a case to a COW mapping, so it's not 
like you can avoid it.
Of course, if VM_MAYWRITE is not set, you could just convert it silently
to a MAP_PRIVATE at the VM level (that's literally what we used to do, 
back when we didn't support writable shared mappings at all, all those 
years ago), so at least now the COW behaviour would match the vma_flags.

Absolutely. I can just see somebody mapping an executable MAP_SHARED and
PROT_READ, and something as simple as doing a breakpoint while debugging
causing system-wide trouble.
I really don't think that's acceptable.
And I'm not making it up - add PROT_EXEC to the google search around, and 
watch it being done exactly that way. Several of the hits mention shared 
libraries too. 
I strongly suspect that almost all cases will be opened with O_RDONLY, but 
still..
