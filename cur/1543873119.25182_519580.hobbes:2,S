I don't see anything in the UHCI snapshots to explain the difference in 
behavior.  One thing that stands out is the other, low-speed device (a 
mouse?) -- in the bad kernel dump its driver was running and in the good 
kernel dump its driver wasn't.
But that shouldn't have affected the result.  In fact, nothing in your
data was significant.  It could be that the problem occurs earlier, at the
time when the keyboard is first plugged in.
Can you get another pair of usbmon logs, starting from before you plug in
the keyboard?  Don't bother with the UHCI snapshots for now.
