The linker will align the start of the section to the biggest alignment
required by any member in the section. So gcc should tell the linker
that video_cards needs 32 bytes alignemnt and we are not facing trobles.
BUT this requires that the labels in the linker script file are
correct assigned like this:
 .tracedata : AT(ADDR(.tracedata) - LOAD_OFFSET) {
        __tracedata_start = .;
        *(.tracedata)
        __tracedata_end = .;
  }
If the assignment of __tracedata_start was doen just before the .tracedata
we would not use the alignment imposed by linker and would see the error you describe.
