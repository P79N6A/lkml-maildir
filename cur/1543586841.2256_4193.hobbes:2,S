This sort of thing is why the comp.lang.c approved way to call
malloc() is
	foo *x = malloc (sizeof *x);
No cast is required and the sizeof usage resembles the
declaration.  The following is what I say on comp.lang.c when
someone does it another way.  AFAICS the recommendations apply
equally to [kv]malloc().
----------------------------------------------------------------------
When calling malloc(), I recommend using the sizeof operator on the
object you are allocating, not on the type.  For instance, *don't*
write this:
	int *x = malloc (sizeof (int) * 128); /* Don't do this! */
Instead, write it this way:
	int *x = malloc (sizeof *x * 128);
There's a few reasons to do it this way:
	* If you ever change the type that `x' points to, it's not
          necessary to change the malloc() call as well.  
	  This is more of a problem in a large program, but it's still
	  convenient in a small one.
	* Taking the size of an object makes your sizeof call more
          similar to your declaration, which makes writing the
          statement less error-prone.  
	  For instance, above, the declaration syntax is `*x' and the
	  sizeof operation is also written `*x'.  This provides a
	  visual clue that the malloc() call is correct.
I don't recommend casting the return value of malloc():
	* The cast is not required in ANSI C.
	* Casting its return value can mask a failure to #include
          <stdlib.h>, which leads to undefined behavior.
	* If you cast to the wrong type by accident, odd failures can
	  result.
