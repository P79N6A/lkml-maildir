I was thinking about this originally, but didn't want to go and modify
every PCI driver to enable it :)
But I do like your patch below that lets the options mix nicely.

What would this help out with?  Would the PCI layer (for example) handle
this "notify the core that it can continue" type logic?  Or would the
individual drivers need to be able to control it?
I'm guessing that you are thinking of this in relation to the disk
drivers, have you found cases where something like this is necessary due
to hardware constraints?
