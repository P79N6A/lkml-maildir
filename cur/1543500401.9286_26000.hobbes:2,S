I doubt that anyone in their right mind would even try putting
that sort of stuff in the kernel.

I can't.  They offer none of the usual filesystem semantics,
incompatible permissions models.
Windows/MS Office offers a similar sort of functionality at the
shell/interface level, and it works OK[0].
People who want things like httpfs seem to be forgetting that
the Unix shell/libc/syscall interface is a low-level one, much
like c is a low-level language.  The way I see it, people who
want resource forks, funny filesystems, &c[1]. for application
usage would be better served by an additional layer insulating
them from libc/Posix interfaces.
