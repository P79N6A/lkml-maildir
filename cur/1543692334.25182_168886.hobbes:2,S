How about a check_headers target that roughly works like this:
for (all header files in include/linux and include/asm) {
	echo "#include <$HEADER>" > header.c
	make header.o
	rm header.c header.o
}
Did a quick test for linux/fs.h in -test5 and it compiled fine, but
broke after removing some random #include.
Another thing, Sam, "make header.o" causes make to call itself
indefinitely.  Had to "make somedir/header.o".  Not sure if you
consider this to be a bug, your decision.
