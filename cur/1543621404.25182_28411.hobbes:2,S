no, it doesn't solve the problem. i would like to test it whith 
preemtible kernel not set but it doesn't boot.
with both 2.5.4 and 2.5.5-pre1 when loading usb-uhci usb.c reports 2 
devices :
device 1 : USB UHCI Root Hub
device 2 : Alcatel Speed Touch USB (the driver module and firmware are 
not loaded at this stage)
when rmmoding usb-uhci with 2.5.4 usb.c reports:
usb.c: USB disconnect on device 1
usb.c: USB disconnect on device 2
with 2.5.5-pre1
usb.c: USB disconnect on device 1
  and nothing else.
