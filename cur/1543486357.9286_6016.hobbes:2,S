There _is_ a way one can update a large set of libraries on a running
system without rebooting.  You have to use ldconfig to do the switch
as it is the only way to assure that the operation is atomic.
Here's how I prefer to do it:
1) Link/copy all libraries from /lib and /usr/lib to /usr/lib/tmp
2) Edit /etc/ld.so.conf listing /usr/lib/tmp first
3) ldconfig
4) Install new libraries
5) Edit /etc/ld.so.conf back to normal
6) ldconfig
7) rm -rf /usr/lib/tmp
This way, all libraries are updated in one atomic operation.
