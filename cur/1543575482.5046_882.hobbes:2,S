Perhaps you should _show_ an actual failure rather than just guessing.
You are wildly incorrect asserting that out of line functions are used
only with CONFIG_ALPHA_GENERIC.  You should examine
#ifndef __raw_writel
# define __raw_writel(v,a)  ___raw_writel((v),(unsigned long)(a))
#endif
and suchlike definitions.

FOR THE NTH TIME, NO IT IS NOT!
How often do I have to point you at the other files that do not
define (all of) these macros before you will believe me?
Jesus H Christ!  Look at some preprocessor output why don't you?
Better yet, compile the kernel with CONFIG_ALPHA_T2.  Notice how
it does not fail with undefined symbol errors.  Notice how there
are non-trivial bit fiddling insns implementing the functions in
alpha/lib/io.o.  That's the quickest way to see that I'm right
and you aren't.
End of discussion.
