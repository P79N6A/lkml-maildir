I dunno, you tell me.
The test app simply sits in select() until a packet comes in, then it 
spins on recvmsg() until there are no more messages.  It uses 
SO_TIMESTAMP to find out when the packet got to the kernel, and does a 
gettimeofday() right after the recvmsg(), then calculates the delta for 
each packet and the overall average.
With 2.4.[18-20], the overall average goes up when the number of packets 
goes up.  For 2.6.0-test6, it stays constant.
