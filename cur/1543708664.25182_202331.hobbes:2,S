Hi,
I'm using stock kernel 2.6.2. I have HUGETLB support compiled in.
CONFIG_HUGETLBFS=y
CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE=y
When issuing this command in a C pgm
shmid =shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, SOMESIZE, SHM_HUGETLB|IPC_CREAT|SHM_R|SHM_W)
I get "Operation not Permitted" when running it as a normal user. It
works for root. Without the SHM_HUGETLB flag it works fine for all users.
How can I grant the permission to use HUGETLB to ordinary users?
Jochen
