   non-root user locked up the console code. console code is part of kernel.
   it is a kernel topic.
The real issue is that X has the console in an indeterminate state (it
probably just saved the VGA state and is outputting probing
information) but now it is blocked on terminal output due to the
"less".
There is nothing the kernel can do about what X is up to.  The suid
wrapper for X can check if stdout/stderr is a pipe and refuse to run
if it is.
So really, it is in fact off topic for linux-kernel.  Please take this
to the xfree86 lists, I'm sure they'll be more than happy to fix it.
Franks a lot,
