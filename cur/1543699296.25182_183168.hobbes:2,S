I'm not sure which part you think is stupid. Do you:
1. Disagree with my paraphrasing of the GPL, in the first two
   paragraphs? 
2. Disagree with the obviously correct statement that the GPL 
   makes requirements about the licensing even of non-derived 
   works?
3. Disagree with my example, given in the final two paragraphs, 
   which makes it clear that a copyright licence _may_ make 
   restrictions on the licensing of even non-derived works. Note
   that although my example is a licence where the licensee must
   release _all_ future work under the same licence, I'm not
   claiming that the GPL does this; I only claim that such a 
   licence is _possible_.
