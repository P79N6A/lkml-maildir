    Hi all :)
    I'm trying to decode what the field in the output of
/proc/net/tcp means, with little success. Apart from the fact that
the four last fields have no description (and looking at undocumented
sources is really a pain a very time-consuming), I have the following
doubts:
    - I assume that 'sl' is the socket number, but, what does 'sl'
stand for?
    - What represents the 'st' field?
    - I suppose that 'tr:tm->when' represents if there is any timer
on that socket (well, 'tr' is the number of timers), and when will
expire the nearest one, but I'm not sure.
    - I suppose that 'timeout' is the time to die when the socket is
in FIN_WAIT state, but I'm afraid I'm wrong :(
    - Does the 'retrnsmt' field show the retransmissions happened in
this socket?
    If anyone can explain me these fields (and the unnamed fields at
the end) I will be very grateful, and if someone could direct me to a
site with related information it will help, too.
    Thanks a lot in advance :)
