No, it didn't. I measured read from a 10GB sequentially laid out file
with standard benchmarking practices (cold cache, multiple runs, low
std. deviation in results, etc.) and here are the results:
File created by vanilla Ext3 being read by vanilla Ext3:
Total: 3m16.1s
User: 0.0.5s
Sys: 13.9
File created by mc Ext3 being read by mc Ext3 (with the buffer
boundary logic disabled):
Total: 3m15.5s
User: 0.05s
Sys: 13.6s
Thanks,
Abhishek
