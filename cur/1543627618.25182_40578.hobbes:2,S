Hiya,
I have an AMD Athlon 1.2 with a VIA 8259A Chipset (see bottom). If I
compile the kernel with the Athlon option it crashes all the time. In
fact, I can't even get Redhat 7.2 installed without a core dump when it
tries to mount the filesystem. With the later kernels, it doesn't core
dump, but just freezes.
IE: If I have ide-scsi module loaded, and I try to access the floppy
drive, it locks up the machine (regardless of whether cputype is Athlon
or K6.)
IE: Updatedb locks up the machine.
I get (when FSCK):
spurious 8259A IRQ7
Does anyone know if there's a bug fix for this chipset? My board is
made from FIC (crappy, instructions don't even matchup). I used to be
able to fix it by changing the CPU type to K6 but that doesn't work now
with the later kernels (2.4.15 and up.)
