Yes, looks like dm-daemon is a workqueue.

This is why using a workqueue, rather than having everyone invent
their own methods, is a good idea.

You could build it on top of kthread probably.  You could also change
workqueues to resize dynamically, rather than be one per cpu (but
that's some fairly tricky code).
Thanks for bringing this code to my attention...
