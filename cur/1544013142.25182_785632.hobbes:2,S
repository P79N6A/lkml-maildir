To late I've changed it. I had an Internet outage yesterday so I've only just
pushed the new trees.
I'm glad. Because I found in exofs code, inside the same file, an "u32 page"
next to a "struct page *page" which is really bad. Now attr_page everywhere
is much clearer.
[ As usual:
    git-clone git://git.open-osd.org/linux-open-osd.git linux-next-exofs
  or on the web at:
    
http://git.open-osd.org/gitweb.cgi?p=linux-open-osd.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/linux-next-exofs
]
I will submit another round of patches once I address all the other comments.
Thanks
Boaz
