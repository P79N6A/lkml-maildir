panic_notifier_list, like all entries defined via
notifier_chain_register, is run in priority order, with LIFO order
within priority.  Register machine_panic first with priority INT_MIN
and it gets called last.
Which reduces your problem to "which one of the 57 initcall levels do I
use for registering machine_panic first on the panic_notifier_list"?
