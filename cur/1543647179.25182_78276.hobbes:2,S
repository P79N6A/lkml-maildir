I have written a device driver for a cPCI device. Thsi device driver loads
and runs successfully when my application starts (I call /sbin/insmod).
However,  when I add the following line to /etc/modules.conf
alias ifp0 Icdrva0s             /* my device is called ifp0 and the driver
Icdrva0s.o is stored in /lib/modules/2.4.18-3/kernel/drivers/net */
I get depmod errors. When I run depmod -e, I see that it is complaining
about all kinds of regular symbols (ioremap, pci_register_driver to name but
a few). What am I doing wrong? Please CC me directly on any responses.
Thanks in advance,
