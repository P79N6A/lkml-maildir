This function will not get called until the sysfs node stops being busy,
so it should all work properly.  But only if that fb_info structure was
allocated dynamically, unlike all of the current fb drivers (see my
other comment about this patch.)
So in that case, this will cause us to try to call kfree on a static
structure :(
