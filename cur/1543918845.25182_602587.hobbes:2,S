Yes, there's also the fact that __pure is a reserved GCC keyword.   
Essentially according to GCC docs all of the GCC-specific keywords  
are equivalently defined as "keyword", "__keyword", and  
"__keyword__", with only the latter two defined in strict-ANSI mode.   
The following is valid according to GCC docs:
static int __attribute__((__pure)) my_strlen(const char *str);
With the proposed definition of __pure, that becomes a noticeably  
invalid __attribute__((__attribute__((__pure__))))
