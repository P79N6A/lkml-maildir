Yep, but I don't have any reasonable suspects.

No. Do you suspect faulty hardware?
Apart from perhaps Adaptec 2940 (Adaptecs always give me trouble), I
believe the hw is pretty solid. It had no problems with 2.2 kernels.  Based
on my experience, the i815 chipset is not that shaky (unlike the Via dung),
and I would expect the Intel motherboard to be on the better side as well.
I can't completely rule faulty hw out, though.
Exchanging hw will be quite difficult, as the hangs take as much as three
weeks to trigger (sometimes they happen withing a day after reboot), the box
is a production server, and I don't have much spare hardware atm.
What I had hoped for is to be able to get some information on where it hangs.
But sysrq and nmi watchdog don't cut it...
