I haven't looked at this code at all, but neither approach feels right to
me.
How does this work at all?  Even if you load a driver later, wouldn't it
call usb_set_interface(), which would call usb_create_sysfs_intf_files()
and hit the same issue?
Heck, why do both call usb_create_sysfs_intf_file()?  I would guess if
you're *changing* the active configuration you would need to do that, but
why in usb_set_interface() at all?
