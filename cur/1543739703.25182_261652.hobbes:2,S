Ha, I think I did not make this clear in the description: The patch did
not add a new ext3-specific ioctl. We added two ioctl before for ext3
reservation code to allow user to get and set reservation window size,
so application could set it's desired reservation window size. It allows
the window size to be 0, however the current reservation code just
simply set the window size value to 0, but still try to allocate a size
0 reservation window. We should skip doing reservation-based allocation
at all if the desired window size is 0.
Just thought seeky random write application could use the existing ioctl
to let the kernel know it does not need reservation at all. Isn't that
more straightforward?
