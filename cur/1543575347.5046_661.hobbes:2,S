I see perfectly your point and this is the reason why we have
__raw_write[bwlq] in 2.4, but write[bwlq] expected semantic is to ensure
that write *happens* and are visible by other agents.
You can tell me that almost nobody uses __raw_write now and this is bad
and I agree with you, but sometime this is not a perfect world ;-)
