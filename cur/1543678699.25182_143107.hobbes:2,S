I'm using an Intel SRCMR RAID controller in RAID5 mode under RedHat 9
with 280GB attatched and have no trouble at all.  From what I can tell
on Intel's website, my card and yours both use the same "GDTH" kernel
driver, so I don't see any reason why yours won't work... unless your
RAID controller model is newer (but it shouldn't be, I see specs on your
model dating back to 2002) and the kernel just doesn't recognize its PCI
ID yet.
HTH,
