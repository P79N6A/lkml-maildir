at least for NUMA systems this is too aggressive (though I believe
normal SMP systems could be hurt, too).
The problem: freshly forked tasks are stolen by idle cpus on the same
node before they exec. This actually disables the sched_balance_exec()
mechanism as the tasks to be balanced already run alone on other
CPUs. Which means: the whole benefit of having balanced nodes
(maximize the memory bandwidth) is gone.
The change below is less aggressive but in the same philosophy. Could
you please take it instead?
