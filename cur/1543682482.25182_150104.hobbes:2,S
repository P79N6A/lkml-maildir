(Apoligies if line-wrapping is nuts, I've been confined to Mozilla....)
This patch fixes a *very* obscure bug, which only applies to VIA chipsets that
support UDMA-133 mode, and which is only known to be tickled by one UDMA-66 hard
drive (Maxtor 91360U4) that happens to report 80-wire cable detection opposite to
the ATA standard.
The bug appears in a test to see how the BIOS set up UDMA timing.  This test is
only reached when the drive says 80-wire *and* the chipset says 40-wire (which is
only known to happen with this drive).
The timing bits that are checked represent clocks T minus 2, i.e., ((N - 2) * T).
But Vojtech forgot to subtract 2, and applied N = 8 rather than N = 6 in the
test.  Since the test masks the bits at 7, they are always less than 8, and the
test always succeeds, even though the BIOS set UDMA-33.
