   Marcelo, if someone sends you a patch which has not been thoroughly
   reviewed on the appropriate mailing list, I would urge you to
   peremptorily shitcan it.  There is no reason why you alone should
   be responsible for reviewing kernel changes.
Are you suggesting that, for example, I should send every Sparc change
to this list?
I bet a lot of what he is seeing are driver and arch updates.
Such updates really only need to go through his "stupid filter"
when it is coming from the maintainer, but it does add up and
take up time.
