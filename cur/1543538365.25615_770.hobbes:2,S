I'm not talking about ripping off patents, but unless someone tells me
*exact patent numbers* covering v.34 and what it means for me wanting
to write v.34 stack myself, I'm going to ignore the issue. And
everyone else should do exactly the same, patents around v.34 are FUD,
nothing more.
This is not stealing. If I write my own software from scratch, I can't
see how it violates someone's rights.
