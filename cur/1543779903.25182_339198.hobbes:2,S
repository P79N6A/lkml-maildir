Fair enough. Should we change the comment? What are the expectations of
programmers wrt. to this interface?

Well, I may have phrased that wrong. It's not that milliseconds in the
kernel wouldn't have the same problem -- they would/do, because they
convert to jiffies eventually.
This is all the same issue, as George pointed out, that itimers face.
If a user requests schedule_timeout(HZ/100); which, if HZ is 1000, is 10
jiffies, yes? But, since we are between ticks, we want to actually add
that request to the next interval, not to the current one. Otherwise, we
do have the possibility of returning early. Currently, we require
callers to add the +1 to their request, and thus they only add it to the
first one. The problem with my patch which pushed it to
schedule_timeout(), is that we will do +1 to every request. I'm not
sure, without some sort of "persistent" timeout control structure, how
we get around that, though, in the schedule_timeout() case. Does that
make any more sense?
Thanks
Nish
