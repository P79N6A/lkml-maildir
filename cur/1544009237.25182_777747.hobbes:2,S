Certainly not at the moment.  There will be a reason some time after .29.
That said, it apparently is possible to clean up the resume callbacks of PCI
USB controllers, as mentioned here:

Well, that's something I'm not exactly sure about myself.  Surely it seems
reasonable to call pci_restore_state() with interrupts disabled and do the rest
of resume after that.  Also, I think that the core could execute things like
pci_enable_device() during resume and pci_set_power_state()/pci_enable_wake()
on suspend so that the drivers didn't have to.  This way we could reduce code
duplication quite a bit.
However, I'm not quite sure about the freeing and requesting IRQs during
suspend and resume.  Many drivers do that, many others don't.  Still,
apparently some drivers don't work correctly after resume if this is not done.
So, if that should generally be done, I also think that moving it to the core
might be a good idea.
Thanks,
Rafael
