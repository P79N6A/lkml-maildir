The examples in section 2 of Documentation/pci.txt use pci_get_*. Some lines
later there is this funny little paragraph:
> Note that these functions are not hotplug-safe.  Their hotplug-safe
> replacements are pci_get_device(), pci_get_class() and pci_get_subsys().
> They increment the reference count on the pci_dev that they return.

How about this:
These functions are hotplug-safe. They increment the reference count on the
pci_dev that they return. You must eventually (possibly at module unload)
decrement the reference count on these devices by calling pci_dev_put().
