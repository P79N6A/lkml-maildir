I wonder if this is good enough.  What do you think to the idea of having
an index passed to the routine (initially set to zero) which could be
incremented to find all copies of this block?  This takes care of RAID-1
and RAID 0+1.
To go even further, support for RAID-[2345] could be added, but this
would be much more complex.  Let's see..
call FIONDEV with index 0
returns FIONDEV_COPIES and the real block
call FIONDEV with index 1
returns FIONDEV_COPIES | FIONDEV_XOR and one of the blocks to combine
call FIONDEV with index 2
returns FIONDEV_COPIES | FIONDEV_XOR and the next block to combine
[...]
call FIONDEV with index n
returns FIONDEV_ERROR to indicate there's no more blocks.
This scheme has no way of saying `you can get block A either by reading
this block here, or by reading this pair of blocks and XORing them, or
by reading this set of other blocks over here and XORing them', but I
don't think such a system exists.  (and I think we could add another flag
to cope with that, if one did).
