Keep in mind that msleep() will ignore all signals & waitqueue events
(the latter doesn't apply here, I don't think) until the specified
number of milliseconds has gone by. msleep_interruptible() may be
preferrable, as you will then receive signals (but still not waitqueue
events). I'm actually not sure if either of these will do what you
need as the existing code does. You may just want to use
schedule_timeout() appropriately, with the remaining time you wish to
sleep for.
