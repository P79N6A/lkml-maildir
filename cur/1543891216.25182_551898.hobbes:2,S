Subject: [GIT PULL] ieee1394 fixes

Linus, please pull from the for-linus branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ieee1394/linux1394-2.6.git for-linus
to receive the following updates to the old and the new IEEE 1394 subsystem:
  - fix hang in s2ram,
  - port a sysfs attribute from sbp2 to firewire-sbp2,
  - fix userspace-exported headers,
  - list new firewire stack in MAINTAINERS.
I'm sorry that the s2ram fix is rather large for an -rc fix but I think
it is acceptable in preparation of the very first release of the new
firewire stack.  Things will get back to normal from now on.
The diff will follow in a reply.  The stat and shortlog:
