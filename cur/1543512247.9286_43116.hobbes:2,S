    The sticky bit hasn't always been there, and when I was at university
    20 years ago we had a bunch of machines running BSD 2.7 with /tmp
    being 777.

    What sparse files live in /var?  The big spaceeaters in /var on my
    machines are X11, spool (==mail), and adm (==log), for the machines
    that don't spit syslog off to a logserver.

    Why not?  /usr/bin survives swimmingly even if it's owned by root.

    I don't think you need either of these.

    I'm thinking on the order of a native Wine-over-Windows install
    disk that drops the kernel, enough scaffolding to load X and Wine,
    and the glue to bring up the windowing system without having to
    log in onto an existing Windows machine.  This gives me the existing
    windows interface (good) with a Unix kernel (double-plus good.)
    plus fat takes a little less room than ext2fs on a floppy, so that
    plus devfs may be enough so I can shoehorn the bloated elephant that
    will be 2.6 onto my install floppy and still have enough room to fit
    the installer and pcmcia utilities.
                  ____
    david parsons \bi/ this is assuming I can fit 2.6 onto a 1.44mb floppy.
