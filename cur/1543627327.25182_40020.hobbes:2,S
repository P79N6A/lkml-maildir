For flakey KVMs, I define a user (switched) in /etc/passwd with the
same uid/gid as root and no password.  Instead of a normal shell, its
login entry is /usr/local/bin/switched which contains
#!/bin/sh
/etc/rc.d/init.d/gpm restart
/sbin/kbdrate -r 30
If there are any problems I log in as user switched, either keyboard or
network.  The script runs to reset mouse and keyboard then the user
exits.  The lack of password means that anybody can reset the KVM
devices to fix problems.
