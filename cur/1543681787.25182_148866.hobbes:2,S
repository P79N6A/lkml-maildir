Subject: [PATCH] BadRAM for 2.6.0-test*
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Okay another try at a BadRAM patch, this time it includes all the needed patches ;-) 
I am sorry to anybody who tried the previous patch; it was incomplete.  I delayed resending due to encountering instability that may have been due to the patch.  Having continued testing I think it was instablitiy in the mainline kernel since I suffered also oopses without the patch.
Things seem to have settled down a little now I having been running stable for a couple of days, but I make no guanantees that there are not oops causing bugs lurking...
Anybody with a "BadRAM" system who wants to give 2.6-test a whirl can now do so...
Please report any any problems encounted with this patch to lkml and CC to me.
Thanks.
