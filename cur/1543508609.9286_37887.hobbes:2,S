It's a bit clearer to me. He says the kernel used for installation runs the
machine without problems. Then he refers to a kernel "supplied by SuSE",
whatever this is supposed to mean. The SuSE-6.1 does not include a precompiled
SMP kernel, so he might have gotten a different kernel from someone else here.
If the kernel crashes real early:
OTOH, I don't even think the kernel itself is the problem at all. In about 80%
of the cased I heard of this scenario, the problem was the bootloader. The
install-disks use syslinux, after installation LILO is used. Most versions
of LILO used to occupy an area in memory which contained information from
the BIOS for multiprocessor use.
AFAIR SuSE-6.1 has a version of lilo with LARGE_EBDA support on CD1 in /unsorted.
I'd suggest to try this one.

I'd second this.

Well, I've seen quite a lot of them running ;-)
