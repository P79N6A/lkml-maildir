Hi,
I've just tried getting an ISDN connection to work with 2.4.21-pre7-ac1 - 
setting up the device etc. works normally, but the connection is killed 
immediately on connection.
Syslog says:
Apr 21 21:07:19 localhost kernel: isdn_tx_timeout dev ippp0 dialstate 0
Apr 21 21:07:19 localhost kernel: ippp0: dialing 1 01929...

It looks like the remote side is hanging up immediately, but from a 
different machine (same kernel, but good old Teles 16.3 ISA card), 
connections to the same ISP work.
Are there any known problems with hisax_fcpcipnp that could cause this?
