Yes, that is the requirement.

Oh, I misunderstood what you wrote above then.

Ok.

Ok.

Ah, but if you do that then the "other" device namespace would have
/sys/devices/block/sda/dev be 8:16, right?  And that is not valid as sda
for that namespace must always map to the device with a 8:0 major:minor
as per the LSB spec.
So, no, that's not going to be allowed, sorry.
