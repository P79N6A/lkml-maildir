Can you elaborate? I thought that this
"real DAG" structure is more or less
equivalent to each developer having
his owm CVS repository...

If I fixed CVS renames, added atomic
commits, splits and merges, and gave each
developer his own CVS repository,
would I be in same league as bk?
Ie 10 times slower but equivalent
functionality?
(3 point merge should be doable for CVS
to and would be good thing anyway,
right?)
