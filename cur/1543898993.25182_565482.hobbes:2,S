You'd think they'd never heard of autoscan...

That's a broken project, I'd say. But you have a point, which is that
autoconf does too little, and automake plugs the gaps badly (and let's
not even talk about the abomination which is libtool).

That's cool :) thanks to KDE using it everyone's autobuilders are having
to adapt to cmake anyway, and it's not hard and you only have to do it
once.

:)
My only real grouch with cmake is that the authors have invented a
language with so bloody many capital letters in it. Looking at cmake
macros makes my eyes bleed even more badly than looking at the mass of
involuted nested brackets in configure.ac's, and that's a difficult
thing to do. (It's less portable than autoconf-generated configure
scripts but most of autoconf's portability tests are for long-dead
systems anyway, and as you said util-linux of all projects doesn't give
a damn. I don't really care if software isn't portable to an Interactive
box --- EOLed in 1992 --- or a SunOS 4.0 or HP-UX 8 box.)
There's a good reason most text is lowercase. Even Lisp moved to
lowercase a long time ago...
