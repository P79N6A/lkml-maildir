Not sure why you find that surprising, that is exactly what is supposed
to happen :-)
If you don't give off_out, we use the current position. For most people,
that's probably what they want. If you are sharing the fd, that doesn't
work though. So you pass off_in/off_out as you please, and the kernel
uses those and passes the updated parameter back out so you don't have
to update it manually.
It's identical to how sendfile() works.
