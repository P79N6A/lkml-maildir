I know it's really hard, the only way of possibly having ABI is plannig 
things really carefully about every single thing, so knowing every 
single piece... It's freakin' hard.

The gains are simply a rough reuse of older modules! Just joking...
I was simply wondering how guys like beos/haiku (it's a microkernel... i

mean, if it's true that they have... I don't think it's because of c++ 
instead of plain c...
