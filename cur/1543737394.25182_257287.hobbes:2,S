But it conflicts in a big way with Kirill's patch.  Could you redo it
against 2.6.9-rc3-mm1, or against just 
fix-of-stack-dump-in-soft-hardirqs.patch
fix-of-stack-dump-in-soft-hardirqs-cleanup.patch
fix-of-stack-dump-in-soft-hardirqs-build-fix.patch
from 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.9-rc3/2.6.9-rc3-mm1/broken-out?
Thanks.
