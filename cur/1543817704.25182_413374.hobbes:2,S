Please clarify. Currently a migration involves:
- stopping or suspending the instance
- backing up the instance and all of its data
- creating an environment for the instance on a new machine
- transporting the data to a new machine
- installing the instance and all data
- starting the instance
If you could just briefly cover how you do each of these steps with zero
downtime...
