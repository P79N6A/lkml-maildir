Hi Linus,
Please pull the 'drm-fixes' branch from
ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git drm-fixes
This includes a bunch of kms fixes, along one with regression with the 
freeing of maps from the multi-master changes, along with make drm build 
on MIPS work.
Dave.

    drm: don't whine about not reading EDID data
    
    Make this message a little quieter, since it's common and not necessarily
    indicative of a problem.

    drm/i915: hook up LVDS DPMS property
    
    The LVDS output supports DPMS calls, but we never hooked up the property code,
    so set property calls didn't actually do anything.  Implement a set_property
    callback for the LVDS output so that the right thing happens.

    drm: create mode_config idr lock
    
    Create a separate mode_config IDR lock for simplicity.  The core DRM
    config structures (connector, mode, etc. lists) are still protected by
    the mode_config mutex, but the CRTC IDR (used for the various identifier
    IDs) is now protected by the mode_config idr_mutex.  Simplifies the
    locking a bit and removes a warning.
    
    All objects are protected by the config mutex, we may in the future,
    split the object further to have reference counts.

    drm: fix leak of device mappings since multi-master changes.
    
    Device maps now contain a link to the master that created them, so
    when cleaning up the master, remove any maps that are connected to it.
    Also delete any remaining maps at driver unload time.
