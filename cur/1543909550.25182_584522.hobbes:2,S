Here's an update to that patch to handle the other 2 places I found
where node_set_state() would be a no-op when MAX_NUMNODES == 1.
I'm continuing to look at uses of node_online_map throughout the kernel.
I'll look at current usage of the node state wrappers as well.  However,
you probably want to fix these other 2 places as well, or you might run
into other issues with empty 'NORMAL_MEMORY and 'CPU node state masks...

[PATCH 1/1] memoryless: actually set node_states[N_HIGH_MEMORY] - v2
v1 -> v2"
+  switch to node_set() to initialize N_NORMAL_MEMORY and N_CPU
   node_states[] as well.
If CONFIG_NODES_SHIFT is unset, then MAX_NUMNODES=1, and
node_set_state() does nothing.  This means that __build_all_zonelists()
does not actually set node_states[N_HIGH_MEMORY].  cpusets needs
 node_states[N_HIGH_MEMORY] to be correctly set, or it will raise a
bug when a new cpuset is created.
Switch to using node_set() in __build_all_zonelists() to
make sure it is actually set.
Note there are other calls to node_set_state() in mm/page_alloc.c,
which perhaps should also be modified.  Since this area is completely
foreign to me I thought I'd first make sure this is the right approach.
	addressed in v2 --lts
