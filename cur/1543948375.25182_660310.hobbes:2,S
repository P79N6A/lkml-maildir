Hi all,
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git.
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
allmodconfig for both powerpc and x86_64.
There was only one minor merge problem and one build problem.
We are up to 35 trees, more are welcome (even if they are currently
empty).
Status of my local build tests is at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/branch/9/.
Also, the linux-next tree is being build/boot tested by the guys at
test.kernel.org.  Thanks to them.
This release has one already known build problem:  CONFIG_NFS_FS && !
CONFIG_NFS_V4 will fail to build.
