I tried sched-O1-2.4.18-pre8-K3 and it didn't work with a SMP kernel
either.
Furthermore it also doesn't work with a UP kernel with Local IO APIC support
(CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC). Without it does work. It reliably hangs in
arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:check_timer (in 2.4.18-pre8-K3 about line 1510)
        printk(KERN_INFO "..TIMER: vector=0x%02X pin1=%d pin2=%d\n", vector, pin1, pin2);
        if (pin1 != -1) {
                /*
                 * Ok, does IRQ0 through the IOAPIC work?
                 */
          printk(KERN_ERR "1\n");
                unmask_IO_APIC_irq(0);
          printk(KERN_ERR "2\n");
                if (timer_irq_works()) {
The "1" still occurs, then it hangs...
Enabling fast FPU save and restore... done.
Enabling unmasked SIMD FPU exception support... done.
Checking 'hlt' instruction... OK.
POSIX conformance testing by UNIFIX

Setting 2 in the phys_id_present_map
