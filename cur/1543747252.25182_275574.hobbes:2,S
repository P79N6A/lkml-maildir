hi, 
thanks for your response Alan,
what i did now is i patched a 2.6.9 version to -ac.
IT8212 is working properly and has found my attached harddisk.
unfortunately i got the next problem :)
my s-ata drives connected to the Intel 925X (ICH6R) are not detected correctly with 2.6.9
solution for now - backup data on IT8212 drive - reboot 2.6.10-rc2 and wait for your proper
patch when 2.6.10 is released. 
another question 
my Asus P5AD2 Premium has got 2 OnBoard Marvell Gigabit chipsets. 
I got a driver package from syskonnect directly - which is working also with 2.6.9/10-rcX.
sysconnect told me that they sended the drivers/patch to the kernel-ml.
does somebody know when it will be merged to the repository?
regards
marcel
