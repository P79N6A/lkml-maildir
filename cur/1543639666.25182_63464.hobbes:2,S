Yes. Later reads/writes fails as they should.

It can be used to determine the size fo the device. Seek then read, if read fails
back off. That's where I first noticed it. The IOtest program from the Cerberus suite
does this.
As to the stupidity of standards, I'm not sure how to answer that. I am not the only
one to raise this issue though.

Yes. As far as I can tell this came in in 2.4.11. Earlier 2.4 kernels and at least 2.2.16 
(I didn't check them all) don't have this problem. If it had always been this way it
probably wouldn't have come up. I'm not trying to pick nits on purpose. Something
used to work and then didn't.

Unfortunately (or not), I don't have any others handy. 
Remember there is no data transfer taking place to do the lseek.
There were a couple of exerpts from the standard in this thread:
