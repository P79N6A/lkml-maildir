The BCM4311/1 card used to work better with bcm43xx than it did with b43; however, since the power 
control problem was "solved" in b43, there is very little difference. When I built my special system 
to use the BCM4311 with b43legacy, there was no difference.
I don't know of any cards that work better with bcm43xx than with b43. Of course, that is comparing 
SoftMAC with mac80211. There is, of course, no comparison.
