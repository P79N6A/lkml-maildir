Hi Peter,
The term is "highwater mark" not "high watermark".  A watermark is an 
anti-counterfeiting device printed on paper money.  "Highwater" is how 
high water gets, which I believe is the sense we intend in Linux.  
Therefore any occurrence of "watermark" in the kernel source is a 
spelling mistake, unless it has something to do with printing paper 
money.
While fixing this entrenched terminology abuse in our kernel source may 
be difficult, sticking to the correct English on lkml is quite easy :-)
Regards,
Daniel
