Hi,
I have tested this on x86_64, and without the config language, the
original oopses, while with the patch below it works fine (as expected).
I've not been able to test the i386 one (no 32 bit testboxes since 2
years) but the change is even simpler there, just an ifdef around the
entire kernel text marking.
Do not mark the kernel text read only if KPROBES is in the kernel;
kprobes needs to hot-patch the kernel text to insert it's
instrumentation. In this case, only mark the .rodata segment as read
only.
