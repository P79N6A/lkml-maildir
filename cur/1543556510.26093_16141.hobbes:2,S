I've played with this too. You can't use ramdisk easily on such a system.
We used root filesystem on floppy without any ramdisk ability and the
memory was enough to boot and route packages. Maybe you can try something
on-the-fly decompressed filesystem to reduce the needed size on the floppy.
I used romfs on floppy because of the small size of fs driver code. And I
don't need to build IDE, SCSI and other modules only floppy, and of course
some network code to do the simple routing we used. The kernel was statically
linked to avoid to having kernel module loading utilities. Though it was
2.2.x kernel.
