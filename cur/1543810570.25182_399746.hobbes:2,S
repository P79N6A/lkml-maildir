Yeah, this is scary.  Early boot is fragile and complex and architectures
might not expect to run smp_prepare_boot_cpu() before setup_arch().
umm, actually it's wrong.  i386's smp_prepare_boot_cpu() diddles with
per-cpu memory, and that's not initialised at that stage.  See the call to
setup_per_cpu_areas() a few lines later.
So I'll drop that hunk.  How important is it in practice?
If it's purely to make printk print something then perhaps we can do
something expedient like:
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
	cpu_set(smp_processor_id(), cpu_online_map);	/* comment */
#endif
right there in start_kernel()?
(That assumes that smp_processor_id() works at that stage.  Surely that's
true).
