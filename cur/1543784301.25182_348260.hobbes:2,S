It was made inline so in theory only the touchscreen drivers had the
dependency. I then moved it to another file which kind of breaks things.
Would using symbol_put and symbol_get be a better solution? I was warned
off those functions in the past but this would appear to be an ideal use
as if the framebuffer drivers aren't loaded, we don't care about this.

This needs to be a fast piece of code as its in an interrupt handler and
we go to great lengths to time things to avoid interference from the
lcd. I need to check what timing overhead those functions have...
