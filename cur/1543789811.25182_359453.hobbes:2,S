You're correct, the check does too much.

Actually this way it becomes redundant with SYMBOL_CHECKED, could you 
merge these two flags? The above check would be also probably better:
	if (sym2) {
		printf(" %s", sym->name);
		if (sym2 == sym) {
			printf("\n");
			sym2 = NULL;
		}
	}
So that this check will stop when it hits the start symbol and continue 
looking for more dependency problems, which is I think I intended with the 
original code.

One "quilt refresh" missing? :-)
