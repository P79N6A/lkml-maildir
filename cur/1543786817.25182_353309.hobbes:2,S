Subject: [PATCH 19/21] mm: dup_mmap down new mmap_sem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/25/76

One anomaly remains from when Andrea rationalized the responsibilities
of mmap_sem and page_table_lock: in dup_mmap we add vmas to the child
holding its page_table_lock, but not the mmap_sem which normally guards
the vma list and rbtree.  Which could be an issue for unuse_mm: though
since it just walks down the list (today with page_table_lock, tomorrow
not), it's probably okay.  Will need a memory barrier?  Oh, keep it
simple, Nick and I agreed, no harm in taking child's mmap_sem here.
