I pulled the tree your working with , and it's got mostly the same
issues .. Are you sure your running the commands properly?
The "lines checked" values that you listed looks wrong .. A few you
listed as "0 lines checked" , or "1 lines checked" .. Which can't be
right..
The git logs also show that arch/x86/math-emu/fpu_trig.c hasn't been
modified since it was pull in on Oct. 11 ..
