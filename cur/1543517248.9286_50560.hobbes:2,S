fwiw, I did a splay tree (aka. self-adjusting tree) for similar reasons
that anyone is welcome to take a peek at.  The self-adjusting property
should theoretically provide cache-like behaviour when most of the
lookups are to relatively few nodes in the tree.  The downside is that
the tree is modified by lookups.
