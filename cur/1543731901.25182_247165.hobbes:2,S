I would like to put a great deal of distance between myself and the 
oppinions I and others have expressed concerning a little driver for a 
camera - and the unacceptable analogy expressed above.
Brian! - comparing Nazies that exterminated millions of people in gas 
chambers with a guy that annoys some people that happens to own a webcamera 
is disgusting.
I do not want anyone to think that I  - in any way - am associated with the 
above repulsive statement.
Kenneth
