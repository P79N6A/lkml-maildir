Two issues which may or may not directly address your problem.  Quoting
the man page:
       ...The  structure  member mtype must have a
       strictly positive integer value that can be  used  by  the
       receiving  process  for message selection (see the section
       about msgrcv).
Here, your 'mtype', the long at the beginning of the message, is 0.
Secondly, the third parameter to msgsnd is the size of the data portion
of the message, not the 'packetlen.'  Usually msgsnd is passed a
structure pointer, say a struct msgbuf *.  In that case, msgsz is:
sizeof(struct msgbuf) - sizeof(long).
The first issue makes anything possible...  The second is just a gotcha
to avoid.
