if a program is trying to squeeze every last bit of performance out of a 
system then you are right, it should run on the bare hardware. however 
in reality many people are willing to sacrafice a little performance for 
maintainability, and portability.
if Adaptive read-ahead was only useful for Postgres (and had a negative 
effect on everything else, even if it's just the added complication in the 
kernel) then I would agree that it should be in Postgres, not in the 
kernel. but I don't believe that this is the case, this patch series helps 
in a large number of workloads (including 'cp' according to some other 
posters), postgres was just used as the example in this subthread.
gnome startup has some serious read-ahead issues from what I've heard, 
should it include an I/O scheduler as well (after all it knows what it's 
going to be doing, why should the kernel have to reverse-enginer it)
