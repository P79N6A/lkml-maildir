Only the malloc() called by gunzip() called by
decompress_kernel() is influenced by this HEAP_SIZE.
gunzip()'s internal work data is stored in that heap.
This only is in effect before the kernel "really" boots,
no?
LATENCY_TRACE is indeed off, ...but can gunzip()'s heap
needs be easier answered by a fatter stackframe (at
decompression time!)?
Thanks,
