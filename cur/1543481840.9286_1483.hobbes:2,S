Hello All,

strange. The System:

Dual PII 333(not overclocked)
256M 100Mhz SDram(Running at 66Mhz, even underclocked
6,4 Ultra DMA HD
3,8 DMA HD( Does wierd things at eats a lot of CPU power, but wasn't use during
the lockup)

SB16 MultiCD
Teac CDr SCSI & Aopen IDE 40x (both not in use)
Teles ISDN(Also not in use)
PCI NE2000 COMP ( In use, but at the moment of the lock not heavily)
The computer was running for 2 days 15:04:22
The following program's were running(not strange according to me)
XFree86
WindowMaker + various dock apps
I was compiling Wine with make -j8

etc(but nothing special)...
The system is RH 5.1 based running 2.2.0pre9(or final)
I also would like to mention that the SCSI-CD emulation code doesn't work on my
system. It worked until 2.2.0pre5 as far as I know.
