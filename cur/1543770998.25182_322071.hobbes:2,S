Well MIDI runs at 31,250 bits/second or 3,906 bytes per second.
After much research by Dave Smith in the early 80s, the MIDI
spec was published in 1983. The data-rate was based upon not
being able to hear the difference in the simultaneity of a
6-note chord (a triad with both hands on the piano). That
equates to 1/3906 * 6 = 0.00154 seconds. (1.54 ms).
Note that because only one note start or stop can sent at a
time, this information was essential for sending and receiving
chords.
Cheers,
