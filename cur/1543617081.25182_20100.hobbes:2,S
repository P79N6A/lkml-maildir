The max_p member of struct gendisk was deleted in 2.5.x.  Is there a
different preferred method for partition detection code to know the maximum
number of partitions it's allowed to present?  Previously I was using this
field in the GPT detection code to only present the first max_p partitions
(because GPT allows an unlimited number of partitions).  For SCSI disks with
the current major/minor numbering scheme, it shouldn't create more than 15
partitions; for IDE, 63.
Thanks,
Matt
