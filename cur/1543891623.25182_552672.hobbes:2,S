Hi!
The stallion driver in 2.6.21.3 put this little notice in my dmesg:
=== Cut ===
Stallion Multiport Serial Driver: version 5.6.0
stallion 0000:00:0b.0: please, report this to LKML: 100b/d001/ffffff
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:0b.0[A] -> GSI 19 (level, low) -> IRQ 17
stallion: probe of 0000:00:0b.0 failed with error -16
=== Cut ===
The card is a EC8/32-PCI with a single connected panel. It used to work 
well with 2.4, mostly well with a patched 2.6.8.1, really bad 
(unstable, lost characters) with 2.6.11(?) and doesn't work at all with 
2.6.21.3.
Should I test it with an EC8/64-PCI? The /32 (ab)uses an IDE controller 
chip as PCI interface, the /64 uses a PLX PCI9050.
lspci -vv for the EC8/32:
