I've also noticed similar problems. Sometimes when I reboot I end up
having no sound coming from the speakers at all and when I try to play
something then the player either hangs(mplayer) or starts to skip
seconds(mp3blaster) (0:00, 0:07, 0:21 ..etc)
Rebooting the computer sevelar times will eventually fix it. Reloading
the module doesn't seem to help, however.
2.4.{18;19;20} vanilla kernels all had that problem, now on 2.5.59 I
haven't noticed it (yet?).
