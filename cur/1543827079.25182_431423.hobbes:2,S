That is what the entirety of Linux development is -- step-by-step.
It is OBVIOUS that it would take five minutes to start ext4.
1) clone a new tree
2) cp -a fs/ext3 fs/ext4
3) apply extent and 48bit patches
4) apply related e2fsprogs patches
Then update ext4 step-by-step, using the normal Linux development process.
