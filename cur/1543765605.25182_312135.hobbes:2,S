There's a comment above qdisc_destroy that says:
/* Under dev->queue_lock and BH! */
I'm not so sure this is the case.  I've included the emails of those
listed as Authors of sch_generic.c and sch_htb.c, hopefully they are the
ones who can help (if not, sorry to bother you).  
The list.h is fine, but if another task goes down this list when it
list_del_init is done, there's a chance that the reading task can get to
the deleted item just as it is being deleted, and has pointed itself to
itself. p->next == p.  This would go into an infinite loop.  
The reason sysrq works is because this doesn't stop interrupts. But put
a local_irq_save around that list and run your test, I bet you won't be
able to do anything, but power off with the big button.
Hope someone can help. I don't know the queue disciplines well enough to
make a proper fix.
