The BOOT stuff is very interesting.  Currently, both my videocards
(in the same pc)
have nice hw-specific framebuffer drivers, but they require that
the card is initialized by the bios first and this only ever
happens to one of the cards.  Xfree _can_ do the job, but way
too late for setting up the framebuffer device.

Having video BOOT would be great, and please make it independent
of the framebuffer drivers.  I might want to try your vesa driver,
but I might also want to use the hw-accelerated chip specific driver
that happens to need an initialized video card.
