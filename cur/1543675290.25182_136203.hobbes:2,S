You have one good idea here, leaving the output unreadable is not it. I
was going to suggest a readable menu but someone beat me to it, it's the
obvious choice for this much stuuf, rather than one (usually folded) line.

Not *that* is the good idea! A nice multiple choice menu with a note to
leave alone unless you have a clue is the right way to do it, but the
default should be what's most likely to work.
You will not get people to leave it alone by making it unreadable, you
will just confust the shit out of them by letting them see such detail if
they don't go looking for it. IMHO of course.
