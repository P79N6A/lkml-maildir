Something in userspace tried to delete an MTRR that didn't exist.
The only time I've seen this happen personally has been with
a dual-head card for which the BIOS set up one MTRR to cover
the video ram used by both heads, and then iirc X did something
silly and tried to remove separate MTRRs for each head on exit.
