Hi.
This problem appears in 2.6.0-test9-mm2 and 2.6.0-test9-bk16.
The issue is: my cdrom drive is on the secondary ide controller as
slave. I try to read the cdrom disc with two different ATAPI cdrom
drives (a Sansung drive and other ATAPI compatible drive) and in both
cases as slave of the secondary ide controller.
The problem appears trying to copy de contents of the cdrom disc to an
iso image in the hard disk.
With this command:
cat /dev/hdd > knoppix-es.iso
..and with this:
cp /dev/hdd knoppix-es.iso
and this other command:
dd if=/dev/hdd of=knoppix-es.iso
... generate the same error than this, a problem with DMA, because the
drive is trying to access to a wrong part of the cdrom, because the
information the driver is reporting to the programs is not the correct
info about the media sizes of the cdroms discs in the drives connected
as slave of the secondary ide controller:
readcd dev=/dev/hdd f=knoppix-es.iso
readcd: Warning: controller returns wrong size for CD capabilities page.

With my LG cdwriter (as master of the secondary ide controller) there is
no problem.
