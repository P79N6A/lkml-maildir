That's wrong.
My count of bug reports for problems with 4k stacks with in-kernel code 
after Neil's patch went into -mm is still at 0.

And this is not that much of an issue since most of these cases can and 
have already been analyzed by static analysis to be below 3 kB stack 
usage.

That's complete bullshit considering that we are talking about an
i386-only patch.
