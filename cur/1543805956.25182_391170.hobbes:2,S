I don't get this explanation at all.
Why would you want to use proxy certificates for you own use? Use your
own certificate for your own processes, and issue one or more proxy
certificates to any daemon that you want to authorise to do some limited
task.
...and what does this statement about "keys being safer in the kernel"
mean?

Signed modules sounds like a better motivation, but is a full dsa
implementation in the kernel really necessary to achieve this?
