yes, we will add that.

no reason to encrypt system files, which are public, and encryption
by itself does not provide the desired integrity - you still end
up having to verify the integrity.

ah, misstated that - the passphrase can be used to HMAC all other files,
but not the kernel and initrd. Only the TPM/BIOS/Loader can do that.

most encryption is slower than hmac, and does not provide integrity.
There are some crypto modes (e.g. IAPM) which do both encryption and
integrity, but they are patented, and have overhead above the cost of
just encryption or integrity checking by themselves.
