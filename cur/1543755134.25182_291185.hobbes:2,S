Subject: Non transparent Intel 82801 PCI Bridge fix in mainline kernel?

Hi,
after installing more RAM in my IBM Thinkpad G40 laptop, I ran into the 
problem that PCMCIA ceased to work.
The problem turned out to have been reported to this list in 2003:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0306.3/0956.html
For a 2.6 kernel the fix seems to be to either comment out 
pci_fixup_transparent_bridge in arch/i386/pci/fixup.c or to raise the 
value of pci_mem_start in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c.
However, none of these fixes have made it into mainline kernel (and I 
guess that is because they would break other platforms where the 
pci_fixup_transparent_bridge *is* needed). So lots of newer IBM 
Thinkpads with 1Gb RAM or more are unsupported with a vanilla kernel.
Now, the question is, is there any probability of a more specific 
fix being merged into the kernel and is there anyone with the code-fu to 
create such a patch?
Kind regards,
David Härdeman
