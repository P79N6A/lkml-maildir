Not sure, if you understand the real problem. A kernel forked binary
is allowed to access /dev/console, but it triggers a kernel bug.

Utter nonsense. Exactly when the driver is available shortly later,
the console will work. If it's not backed by a driver, it should not
try to load it, it will never get any driver loaded by opening it. The
kernel must handle that.

Nonsense. The kernel calls /sbin/modprobe directly, no hotplug involved.

The kernel calls modprobe for something, modprobe tries to log an
error, and the kernel calls modprobe again. Bug! No hotplug involved.

Totally wrong, It never was that way.

Please update your idea of hotplug and the kernel module loader, you
are on the totally wrong track.
