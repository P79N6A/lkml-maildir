Dear Sir, 
I know that you would be surprised to receive a
business proposal from an unknown person, your name
and particulars were released to me by the Ivorian
Chamber of Commerce Abidjan, because I needed a trust
worthy foreign business counterpart for an urgent
business transaction for our mutual benefit.
I am Mark Johnson the rightfull inheritor to the
throne of late king Sankoh Johnson the Xi of mende
Sierra-Leone my father untill his death was the king
of mende tripe Sierra-Leone and a Gold machant. He was
murdered by the rebel forces on the accusation that he
is in support of the democratically elected president
Alhadji Tejan Kabbah, and when they raided our palace
my 16 brothers and sisters were mudered in cold.
Blood. My mother was spered because my uncle informed
them that she will lead them to me however she was
seriously wounded and she gave me the key to our
secret underground house, where I discoverd a box
containg 26 million US Dollars and I was successfully
insmuggling the money out of Freetown Sierra-Leone
through a fishing boat to Abidjan.
Presently the money has been deposited with a private
security company here in Abidjan for safe keeping so
thats why I contacted you, to come down to Abidjan
and help me open a local account in a bank, using your
private or company name for the money to enter the
system and also to help me transfer the money through
the account opened, to your country for a meaninful
investment, you will receive 20% of the total amount
for your noble assistance, 5% will be set aside for
any expenses that you may encounter throungh out this
transaction.
Please contact me immediately through my e-mail
address.
Thanks for your anticipated co-perations in this deal.
Best regard
Mark Johnson
