Hi Alan
thanks for the input! This BIOS seems to be current, there are just two
beta BIOS available and as in the changelog there is nothing IRQ related
written (there is almost nothing in it) I don't think I want to flash
one of them, but here are the various options I tried:
noapic > the one and the same thing, but this time (as classic PIC is
used) nobody cared about IRQ 11.
acpi=noirq > the same, this time IRQ 185
pci=routeirq > the same as right above
pci=nobios > without irqpoll hda DMA expire, IRQ lost, with irqpoll IRQ
169 again
pci=noacpi > the same as two and three above
irqfixup (instead of irqpoll) > hda DMA timer expire, IRQ lost
I may have missed some options to try out, do you suggest some else?
I've read kernel-parameters.txt and tried to find reasonable options...
But what I don't get... how tragic are those "irq N nobody cared" and
"drive appears confused" messages as I don't see a negative impact? And
at the end, what do they mean? If an IRQ is disabled I thought the
device behind it would not work anymore... but...
Maybe I will give the two beta BIOS a try nevertheless.
greetings
Michael
