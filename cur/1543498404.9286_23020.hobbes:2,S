I do _really_ agree with this. I think the people would be better
helping in doing a well-behaved multithreaded (not multiprocess) Apache.
Someone said two days ago that if we can not design eficient servers in
user-space then it's the OS that needs to be fixed, and not the server
moved into kernel space.
I have been using Linux for 5 years now (my first distro was a Slack
1.2, still have the CD ;-D), mainly for its _legendary_ stability, and
with all this kernel-space-servers hype I'm starting to be afraid of my
favorite OS becoming as unstable as my most hated other OS, which has
moved a lot of things to kernel space...
I'm in no way a micro-kernel advocate, just a stability advocate. In my
opinion, kernel things are much more risky than user space things, but
surely there are more kernel geeks here with a more valuable opinion
than mine...
