Subject: [patch 0/9] mount ownership and unprivileged mount syscall (v6)

After much sitting in -mm, Andrew dropped this patchset due to
conflicts with other stuff.  It would be nice, if it could be reviewed
in time for 2.6.26 (2.6.25 is closed as far as I understand).
v5 -> v6:
 - update to latest -mm
 - preliminary util-linux-ng support (will post right after this series)
Thanks,
Miklos
