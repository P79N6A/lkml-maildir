It is the upper level device init/insmod that is driving the load of the
scsi adapter (in scsi.c), not the init/insmod of scsi.o. I can't think of
a good reason to just load the scsi adapter if you want it, rather than
having the init of sd.o load it.
IMO, it should go away or always happen - not conditionally on whether another
adapter is already available, or whether sd.o is loading.
If you are booting without initrd, aren't there lines in /etc/modules.conf
for scsi_hostadapter?
If you are booting with initrd, my RH 7.2 mkinitrd shows:
ln -s /bin/nash $MNTIMAGE/sbin/modprobe
man nash says:
	Additionally,  if  nash  is  invoked  as modprobe, it will
	immediately exit with a return code of zero.  This  is  to
	allow  initrd's  to  prevent  some extraneous kernel error
	messages during startup.
