OK, I tracked this down to another secret dhowells diff.
 config SHMEM
-       default y
-       bool "Use full shmem filesystem" if EMBEDDED && MMU
+       bool "Use full shmem filesystem"
+       default y if EMBEDDED
+       depends on MMU
This change permits CONFIG_SHMEM=n on !CONFIG_MMU, even if !EMBEDDED.  Or
something.  I'm not really sure what it's trying to do, nor am I clear on
what semantics we wanted to have for CONFIG_SHMEM on CONFIG_MMU machines.
I think the semantics we want are: you always get shmem, unless you
selected EMBEDDED.  So perhaps we want:
config SHMEM
	bool "Use full shmem filesystem" if EMBEDDED
	depends on MMU
	default y if MMU
