with the earlier version these spinlocks were simply disabling
preemption, while now they will schedule away on contention. If that tty
lock is held for a long time by a lowprio task then that could delay the
highprio thread. We are starting to see priority inversion problems. 
But, the core issue is doing tty printouts - does jackd do that
periodically, or only as a reaction to an already existing latency?

this one is interesting - does the jackd highprio thread start new
threads and lets them exit? The above schedule() is the final one of an
exit()-ing thread.

same exit() scenario. That would be pretty much a no-no, a new child
thread inherits the parent's SCHED_FIFO priority and due to
child-runs-first it could delay the parent possibly indefinitely.
