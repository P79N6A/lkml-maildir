Subject: workaround large MTU and N-order allocation failures

Hello,
Is there currently a workaround available for handling large MTU 
(larger than 1 page, even 2-order) in the Linux network stack?
The problem with large MTU is external memory fragmentation in
the buddy system following high workload, causing alloc_skb() to 
fail.
I'm interested in patches for both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.
Thanks,
