no, it does not happen often at all, even under heavy load the ratio
between cached kmaps and full flushes is 1:10000. So the advantage of
using _PG_GLOBAL in kmaps is pretty significant i believe, especially
since the pagecache is in high memory.
i believe mapping/unmapping memory in threaded apps generates the most TLB
flushes.
