Yes, it's not too bad though.  In the swap-in path, the locking would be against
mem_map + (pfn >> 2).  The four pages don't have to be read in and valid all at
the same time - it's ok to take multiple faults on the cluster, not recommended,
but ok.  In the swap-out path, all four page frames have to be swapped out and
invalidated at the same time.
