Inside individual drivers, or a set of compat macros, it makes sense.
But as a general module.h primitive it doesn't.
Imagine a structure adds an owner field in 2.5.  This macro doesn't
help you, you need a specific compat macro for that struct.
ie. AFAICT it only buys you 2.2 compatibility, and even then only if
you #define it at the top of your driver.
I still don't understand: please demonstrate a use in existing source.
Rusty.
