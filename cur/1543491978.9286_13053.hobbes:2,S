Yes some bugs were introduced. I discovered that it would no longer
hang up and Alan fixed that, however the problems are more far-reaching.
Basically, the driver now "remembers" stuff that it shouldn't and
won't let you reset things.
The work-around is to use setserial to reset everything between
accesses. You have to change the parameters to something phony,
then set them back to get them to "take" (stay after the port is
closed).
