Hello, Jim,
The other thing to keep in mind is that reducing the grace-period
duration increases the per-access overhead, since each grace period
incurs a cost.  So there is a balance that needs to be struck between
overflowing memory with a too-long grace period and incurring too
much overhead with a too-short grace period.
How does the rest of the kernel work with all interrupts to
a particular CPU shut off?  For example, how do you timeslice?
						Thanx, Paul
PS.  My concerns with some aspects of your design aside, your
     getting a significant change to the RCU infrastructure to
     work reasonably well is quite impressive!
