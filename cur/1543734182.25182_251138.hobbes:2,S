On a lot of 2.4 boxes they aren't harmless but thats 2.4 IPI messsage
handling bugs. People sometimes assume an IPI is delivered once - but
its not its delivered "at least once" and when you get a checksum error
like on old dual celerons you get replays.
They also identify kernel bugs in some other bit combinations so they
are useful there too. I'd say this should only go if we are sure 2.6.x
handles IPI replay properly and we mask bits off to see if its real news
or a retry.

The IDE layer will generate these naturally as will any other code that
happens to clear an IRQ causing event in non IRQ context. Eventually you
clear it just as the IRQ is raised, and the pulse causes the error.
This should really go.
