ah, ok. The x86 APIC does that automatically, and only an EOI has to be 
passed. So i guess we are in wild agreement ;)
i'm hacking up something now to see whether it makes sense to introduce 
a central threaded flow type, or whether it's better the branch off the 
current flow types (as the code does it right now).
