No, while the cdrom_ioctl thing does use sg_io, the really old and 
horrible sg_scsi_ioctl thing does it's own commands by hand.
I don't know why. I get the feeling that it _should_ use sg_io().

Oh, I clearly agree with you that something had to be done. Which is why I 
did an extended version of your patch already.

Yes. I think we should do:
 - harmless read-only commands that we know, we allow for read opens
 - harmless write-only commands that we know, we allow for write opens
 - commands we don't know, or commands that aren't harmless, we require 
   RAWIO-capability for.
That seems fairly trivial to implement, and is clearly the user-friendly 
thing to do. The quick patch is just too damn unfriendly.
