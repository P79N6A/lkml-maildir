Well, please read the docs for cdrecord again carefully. The story is not about
_free_, it is about _money_. Certain versions of cdrecord are licensed to
commercial customers for _money_. So please rethink your position.

Well, if I were owner of docs that are important for Joerg to make money and
had listened to him for the past 4 or 5 years and how he treated people (and
still does) it would be highly probable that I wouldn't be very cooperative,
too.
Please see the whole picture, not only what Joerg talks about.
Just take a clear look at his latest code changes and tell me if they look like
being done by an open-minded and friendly person to you.
Speaking from a potential commercial customers' point of view I decided against
using this software, not because of the money, but because of the
closed-everything-and-his-ears habit of the author. I don't see how this
project can survive its current author. Therefore I consider it an already dead
horse.
