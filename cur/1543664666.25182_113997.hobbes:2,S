The similar problem occurs on many of our machines, so I would exclude 
memory corruption.

The numbers crunched by these machines are loaded from and writtem to 
the net, so I would assume that.
We had these machines running potato with 2.2.21 since last summer and 
the kernel never oopsed.
Due to this fact I expect this to be a bug in the SMP code of 2.4.20 or 
a kernel misconfiguration by us.
I'll send the next oops as soon as it occurs.
Kind regards,
Christopher
