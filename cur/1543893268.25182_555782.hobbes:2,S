That's not quite right:
    * SELinux Strict Policy is a default-deny system: it specifies
      everything that is permitted system wide, and all else is denied.
    * AA and the SELinux Targeted Policy are hybrid systems:
          o default-deny within a policy or profile: confined processes
            are only permitted to do what the policy says, and all else
            is denied.
          o default-allow system wide: unconfined processes are allowed
            to do anything that classic DAC permissions allow.
