The important thing to remember is that this isn't a normal scheduling
method, it's used for VERY specialised software which is assumed to
have (almost) complete control of the machine.  Gang scheduled
processes would have the highest priority possible and would get
executed before any other processes.  This works because the software
knows what it's doing and assumes that the user only ran one bit of
gang scheduled software, if all of these are valid assumptions
everything should work nicely.
Thinking about it, if a process just sets itself to be the highest
priority and constrains it's self to appropriate processors then it
wouldn't surprise me if this was just what you want to do gang
scheduled.
