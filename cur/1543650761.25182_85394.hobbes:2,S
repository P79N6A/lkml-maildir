Hi
Build fails with:
drivers/acpi/sleep.c: In function `acpi_system_suspend':
drivers/acpi/sleep.c:209: warning: implicit declaration of function `do_suspend_lowlevel'
drivers/acpi/sleep.c: In function `acpi_sleep_init':
drivers/acpi/sleep.c:707: `sysrq_acpi_poweroff_op' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/acpi/sleep.c:707: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/acpi/sleep.c:707: for each function it appears in.)
The structure declaration is protected by
#if defined(CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ) && defined(CONFIG_PM)
on line 640.
Config file attached.

Kind regards,
Robert Varga
