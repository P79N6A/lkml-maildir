Certainly.  Any GPL code requires source availability.

Correct.  However, in practice, unmodified sources are often
acceptibly pointed to from their originating source.  This allows
one to obtain the latest sources as well.  They are required
nonetheless to provide source themselves should someone want it,
but in practice pointing out where it is available online is
usually is technically what someone is looking for.  They are
required however, as you state.
There has been discussion lately about loosening the wording of
the GPL so that one can point out somewhere on the internet that
the exact source they've used is located to meet the source
requirement.  Changing world...

Yes, that is the legal wording of the GPL, but in practice, if
someone shows where it can be obtained, most people are sane
enough to get it from there.  If they can't however for whatever
reason - if just to prove a point, they can of course get it from
the company directly by means of the GPL requirement.

Absolutely.
