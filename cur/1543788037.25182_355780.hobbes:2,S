Daniel,
If it works then sure.  That would also show that the offending CPU is not
taking any normal interrupts (non-ipi).
Ingo, do you get the same on your 8x machine?  Or is this just somthing
strange with Dinakar's machine?
Dinakar, can you try Daniel's patch, and let us know if it works or not?
Thanks,
-- Steve
