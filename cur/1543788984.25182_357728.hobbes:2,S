I don't know. These xruns take hours to generate. I'd probably have to
dedicate a whole day of doing nothing on the machine to try, and then
if I didn't produce anything I'm not sure what it proves. If I do get
one then we get to see if there's data.
I'd really like to do the IRQ-off tests that you do before I go that
direction but unfortunately it's broken very badly since yesterday's
-rt1 release.
Maybe a better path to take would just be pushing the machine harder.
Do some real work in Ardour. Build up a big session and let it rip for
a while and see what that produces?
I don't know really.
