If there hasn't be much IO for some time, it looks quite reasonable to expect
that there won't be more in the near future. As most of heuristics can fail, but
then this is a feature mostly for desktops, not servers.
There's an old saying that says something like "an open source project starts
dying when new people can't participate in the project no matter how hard
they try". It's hard to understand why there's so many people opposing to
this when other more controversial features are merged much faster, (like, fe. 
the UIO driver framework).
