Ben Dooks didn't like that suggestion, and I don't care that
much, so you may want to leave this one alone.

AFAICT, it would be perfectly fine for sg_cnt to be larger than 1,
just not smaller. I don't understand yet how your hardware would
deal with this though.

Ideally, the via_set_ddma function would be able to program the scatterlist
into the hardware registers directly. If this doesn't work, you may
be able to look over all elements in the list manually. If this doesn't
work either, you will have to go back to your original code, and replace
the virt_to_phys conversion with dma_map_single()/dma_unmap_single().

I would argue that 1ms is too long for tasklet (softirq) context as well,
and this should better be moved to a work queue.

It's still hard to tell what 'quickly' means here. There is a latency for
entering work queues or tasklets, but if the system is idle, that should
not be noticable. OTOH, if the system is busy, it may be worthwhile doing
something more important before working on the MMC workqueue.
It's probably something you should measure. If you don't find a significant
slowdown by moving to a work queue implementation, I would recommend doing
that in order to simplify the driver.
