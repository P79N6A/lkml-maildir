you change isn't equivalent : previously, we called cpu_rq() for
0..NR_CPUS-1, and now you call it for 1..NR_CPUS.
You should have written :
+ for (i = NR_CPUS - 1; i>=0; i--)
which might still be a win towards the former version.
But of course, this is only valid if i is SIGNED, and it isn't here.
Another valid form which would work with unsigned int is :
+ for (i = NR_CPUS; i--; )
but I'm not sure it will save some cycles because increments/decrements
within conditions are not always well optimizable.
Same comments for other locations.
Cheers,
Willy
