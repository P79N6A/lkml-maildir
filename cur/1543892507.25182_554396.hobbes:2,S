But doesn't it only know the meaning after doing a setkeycodes for easy-access 
keys? I find it somewhat counter inituitive that doing "setkeycodes e023 163" 
will give me a keycode 163 on the console (as reported by showkeys), but will 
send a scancode of 153 to the X-server.

Well to be honest I'm looking for a somewhat more quick fix then that. Let me 
try to explain. Xorg comes with keyboard descriptions for many special-access 
keys having keyboards. These descriptions can be easily selected by the end 
user from the kde / gnome keyboard properties applets.
This however only works with softraw=0 for 2 reasons:
1) without softraw=0 the key presses never reach the server when there hasn't
    been an setkeycodes command for the easy access key
2) even if a setkeycodes command was given, then the keycode given to
    setkeycodes doesn't match the scancode seen by xorg, messing things up.
    (unless one uses setkeycodes with a reverse mapping of the mapping done in
     the kernel)
There are 3 ways out of this:
1) write special loadkey maps for all the easy access keyboards, since unlike X
    loadkeys AFAIK doesn't support inheriting keys from a global layout, the
    number of language-layout <-> keyboard model variants would become quite
    frightening.
    When loadkeys has been thought to map the special keys according to the
    linuxkeyboard codes, then X needs to be tought how to handle a linux
    keyboard and default to this
    Also configuration utils need to be written to properly set things up for
    loadkeys, as autodetecting this is impossible
2) Somehow fix things so that selecting the right model in gnome/kde
    keyboard-preferences will make the keys work. Like it does now with
    softraw=0. Which leads me to asking what are the downsides of using
    softraw=0?
    What about be default defining keycodes for all the 128+ scancodes not yet
    defined, and defining these in such a way that the actual scancodes is what
    gets send to X?
    Or maybe it would be an option to send the raw scancode just like is done
    with softraw=0 when there is no mapping (instead of ignoring the key as is
    done now).
    Since the xkb discriptions for most of the easy access keyboards have been
    written by Suse, I assume the tested them and it works for them. Does anyone
    know how suse does this?
3) Forget about all this and leave things as is, this one clearly does not have
    my preference.

Hans
