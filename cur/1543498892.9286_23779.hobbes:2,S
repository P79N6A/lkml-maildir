S'ok....
I was being silly. Kid gloves meant that it detected the UDMA capability
of the hard drive, and managed to use the drive properly. I also
overassumed the 2.0.x abilities on UDMA (i.e. read the source of ide.c,
and found that it's treated like a regular DMA drive, other than it simply
re-trying operations after a crc error). Which leads me to ask, is there a
stable patch to 2.0.36 to get more out of the UDMA drive?
I found the one for 2.0.37pre12, but I kind of need to stay off of
pre-patches....
