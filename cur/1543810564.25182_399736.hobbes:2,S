Side note: if people want to, we could have other "trampolines" like that, 
so that we could have more user-level code that gets distributed with the 
kernel. It doesn't have to be something that gets mapped into every binary 
either: we could - if we wanted to - have things like shared libraries or 
helper shell scripts or whatever that we expose in /sys/shlib/ that are 
kernel-version dependent.
Then we could perhaps change more things, just because we could change the 
wrappers that actually use them together with the kernel.
To some degree, /initrd was supposed to do things like that, and in 
theory, it still could. However, realistically, 99% of any /initrd is more 
about the distribution than the kernel, so right now we have to count 
/initrd as a distribution thing, not a kernel thing.
