Problem identified and solved.
The last good kernel was 2.6.23-git17. The change in 2.6.23-git18
that broke my 486 was a24e785111a32ccb7cebafd24b1b1cb474ea8e5d,
which included the following:

That is, it added loads from %ds:offset(%esi) before the code
that sanitises %ds et al. Commenting out these loads and tests
made the kernel boot again.
Adding debugging code to head_32.S and decompress_kernel(),
I found that startup_32 actually is invoked with a good %ds
(== 0x18 == __BOOT_DS) and a flat 4GB data segment in the
corresponding GDT entry.
Since data accesses work after %ds is (re)loaded with __BOOT_DS,
it's clear that on this machine, the hidden registers behind %ds
are stale on entry to startup_32. After adding a patch to reload
%ds with itself (not __BOOT_DS) at startup_32 the kernel doesn't
crash and reboot any more on this machine.
The machine in question is a ca 1993 vintage Siemens 486 with
a Quadtel S3 / Phoenix BIOS from 1994, booting via grub-0.95-13
from Fedora Core 4.
