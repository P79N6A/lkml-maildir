Hey, this is pretty cool.
Recalling threads from LKML past, there are two mechanisms I (and some 
others) felt were missing from the equally nifty workqueue stuff:
1) one-shot threads
2) keventd overflow
For #1, your patch seems to cover that nicely.
For #2, that's to be used for situations where (a) you need a thread 
context _and_ (b) you simply cannot wait for keventd to become available 
(since there are no time guarantees).
Anyway, thanks for doing this, it fills a need, I believe.
	Jeff
