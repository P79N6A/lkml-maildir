Right, programming a PIRQ router to an IRQ doesn't mean that a legacy
device isn't still attached to that IRQ.

While there may be non-standard non-PCI legacy devices that
(erroneously) use PIRQ routers on legacy systms, that isn't the issue at
hand.
The issue at hand is what to do in ACPI mode.
ACPI PCI Interrupt Link Devices, by definition, are used only by PCI
devices, or devices that look like them.  You look up the device in the
_PRT by its devid.  Although links are often implemented underneath by
PIRQ routers, they are much more general.  ACPI PCI Interrupt Links can
specificy any trigger/polarity, as well as connect to IOAPIC inputs.
If there is "special" hardware using an ACPI PCI Interrupt Link without
being listed in the DSDT _PRT that describes the link, then the BIOS is
simply broken.
