Hi !
So I see this construct:
	if (test_and_set_bit(0, &chip->opened))
		return -EBUSY;
	.../...
	return 0;
_error:
	dprintk(1,"Error opening PCM!\n");
	clear_bit(0, &chip->opened);
	smp_mb__after_clear_bit();
	return err;
So that's basically an attempt at doing a spinlock. The problem is your
barrier is wrong at the end. Better would be:
done:
	smp_mb__before_clear_bit();
	clear_bit(0, &chip->opened);
Though it's still less optimal that doing:
	if (!spin_trylock(...))
		goto bail;
	.../...
done:
	spin_unlock(...)
If you really want to stick to bitops, then you may want to look at
Nick's upcoming patches adding some bitops with appropriate lock
semantics.
Cheers,
Ben.
