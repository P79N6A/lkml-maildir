Well, it doesn't reintroduce the for_each_task() (not that it's present
in similar form) loop in count_active_tasks(), so it doesn't bother me.
You seem to have merely changed some offsets, which resolves the
round_jiffies() clash. It's easy to envision similar degenerate cases,
though I'm not sure we care enough to drop in a PRNG to handle them.
