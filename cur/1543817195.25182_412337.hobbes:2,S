Ah ok, kallsyms... I've been pampered by good quality kernels and turned it
off a long time ago.
initcall at 0xffffffff8049a5b0: late_hpet_init+0x0/0xb0(): returned with error code -1
loke@sleipner:/home/git$ grep -i hpet 2.6.16-git-kallsyms-.config
CONFIG_HPET_TIMER=y
CONFIG_HPET_EMULATE_RTC=y
CONFIG_HPET=y
# CONFIG_HPET_RTC_IRQ is not set
CONFIG_HPET_MMAP=y
Those options are just wish-thinking since the machine doesn't have that kind of timer.
So the warning should go away when I turn them off. Sorry about the noise.
