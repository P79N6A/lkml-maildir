   The stuff I have met with CompactFlash cards (*without* USB) - they 
by default were coming formated with single FAT12 partition - no 
partition table whatsoever.
   I had no problems with partitioning and formating (in IDE emulation 
mode).
   But Windoz2kOfBugs was refusing to work with flashes which had 
partition table, and was working Okay with /original/ FAT12 formated 
flashes. Windoz wasn't even trying to read partition table, always 
showing flash as one drive - and sure it was reporting stupid errors 
when you were trying to do something with partitioned flash.
   It looks like /agreement/ (with The Beast) that flashe/memory card 
has to have FAT12.
