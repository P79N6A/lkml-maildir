You do of course realize that your problem was caused by other people
who probably have exactly the same attitude as you do -- they didn't
care whether they were doing the right thing, they just slapped together
something that worked, even if it did introduce way too many routing
hops.  So you're introducing a kludge to counteract their kludge, and
eventually this all turns into a big pile of kludges that doesn't work.
To the extent that the Internet works today, it's because people have
chosen to do the right thing instead of just the thing that works.
Encouraging (not "bullying") other people to do the right thing is
always a good idea.
