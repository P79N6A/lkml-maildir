Seems it is the memory, then.
Things getting *better*�when moving memory may mean:
* slight timing problem - in that case the memory might be fine
  at a slower setting.  (Reason for complaints if you must go below spec.)
* Moving memory around rubs dirt, dust and oxide off the contacts, both on
  the memory sticks and the mainboard connectors.  This gives
  better contact and may improve things.  Consider cleaning the
  connectors further.  Also look for dust and hair lying in
  the mainboard connectors.  It happens, especially when some
  slots are free for a long time until memory is added.
