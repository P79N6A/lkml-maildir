Slowly you mean. I've read the UDI spec in detail. Its about fit for BIOS
loaders but thats it. If intel provide source it will be worth porting their
drivers to the OS properly. If intel don't provide source we don't care anyway.
You simply cannot express stuff like the linux parport sharing in UDI, its
got no equivalence. Out goes parallel devices. You can't portably express
the Linux tty layer, out go tty devices. It's too slow for serious networking
and it can't properly express our scsi stuff and make good use of it.
So what are you going to do with it. Joysticks ?

Which can have very long lock holding times. Not funny at all.

UDI can't correctly express the Linux resource management in a portable way,
nor the memory allocator, nor the layering stuff.

If you dont change you get the windows 98 problem.

Yes some will.  But as with 2.0 the changes so far to do a simple job are
easy.

Rubini's book is apparently being updated. I have written a set of articles 
for Linux Magazine on 2.0->2.2 conversions - you can grab them from
O'Reilly's web site or buy the magazine 8)
There is a project going on to write a complete, thorough Linux kernel
book on the net.  There are 2 or 3 other kernel books too.
