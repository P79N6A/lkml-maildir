It looks like {IN,OUT}_{BYTE,WORD}() are now the arch-specific routines to
access the IDE registers, controlled by HAVE_ARCH_{IN,OUT}_BYTE?
If yes,
  - Why not call them ide_{in,out}[bw]()?
  - What about {in,out}s[wl]{,_swapw}()? Don't we need abstractions for those
    as well?
  - The old (ISA/PCI I/O only) {in,out}[bwl]() are still used in many places.
