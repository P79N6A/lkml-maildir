Do you mean (t6 - t0) where you have (t6 - t1)?

This would be an idle fraction, not an idle time. (seconds divided by seconds)
It doesn't seem quite right to me that a cgroup's idle time metric be
affected by the activity of other cgroups on the machine, but it's
hard to come up with a way of measuring it that doesn't have this
behaviour - which is why, in the absence of hard CPU partitioning,
it's not clear to me how much use this would be.
What would people be planning to use it for?
