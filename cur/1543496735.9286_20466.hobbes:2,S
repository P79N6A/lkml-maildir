Well, this old Dell BIOS [1] only supports "None", "Auto" or "User".
The Auto does not go so far as to allow me to specify LBA.

I take it then that DOS/Windows will typically lose the end of the
disk due to translational rounding errors.
Giuliano.
[1] Depressing fact: Dell BIOS help line: "press ALT-P for next page",
yeah right. ALT-N is for next page, ALT-P is for previous page. Both
