   I'm using also gcc-2.95.1 (with glibc-2.1.2, gcc-2.95.x has problems

   How does this bug appear ?

Also using glibc-2.1.2.
I patched up from pre13 to pre14, re-booted with a normal shutdown,
restarted X, Netscape-4.61, and looked at my Inbox. The last two weeks
of mail did not show up. I booted back to 2.3.18ac9 and it was there. I
only see problems when booting a new kernel. It happened with ac7 also.
