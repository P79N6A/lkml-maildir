Andreas - I will suggest you to submit a new patch with
a better changelog where you jsut describe what you fix.
The above explanations looks a bit weird if read stand alone.
You can always add additional comments after the line containing:
---
In this way it is not included in the changelog but Linus can read it.
Anyway - your patch has my ack.
