It already has ordered write when it is in flush mode.
OK, I hear you. There will be an ordered write mode that uses barriers
to decide the ordering.  It will greatly reduce the speed at which
ramback can flush dirty data because of the need to wait synchronously
on every barrier, of which there are many.  And thus will widen out the
window during which UPS power must remain available if power goes out,
in order to get all acknowledged transactions on to stable media.  The
advantage is, the stable media always has a point-in-time version of
the filesystem.
Don't expect this mode in the immediate future though, there are bugs
to fix in the current driver, which already implements the required
performance and stability requirements for a broad range of users.

That would have been a miscommunication then.  I see arguments coming
in that suggest embedded solutions, EMC for example, are inherently more
reliable than a Linux based solution.  Well guess what?  Some of those
embedded solutions already use Linux.
Also, peecees are much more reliable than people give them credit for,
especially if you harden up the obvious points of failure such as fans
and spinning disks.  Once you have your system all hardened up, then
you _still_ better replicate your important data.  Perhaps I should not
admit this, but I simply fail to do that on the machine from which I am
posting right now, which also runs my web server and mail system.  That
is because I would have to reboot it to install ddsnap so I can replicate
properly, and because the thing is so darn reliable that I just have
not gotten around to it.  I do copy off the important files from time
to time though, and do various other things to ameliorate the risk.  If
it was enterprise data I would obviously do a lot more.

My immediate goal is to replace disk with RAM.

Exactly what I mean: close but not there.  Those gigantic RAM boxes are
shipping now, and the same company has got a 5 TB flash box coming down
the pipe, and sooner than Q3.  But the RAM box will always outperform
the flash box.  You just keep throwing writes at it until all available
flash is in erase mode, and the thing slows down.  If that is not a
problem for you, then great, you can also save a lot of money by going
with flash.  But if nothing less than the ultimate in performance will
do, RAM is the only way to go.
