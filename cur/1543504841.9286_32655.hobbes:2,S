Looks like its the kernel.  I can still switch ttys, ctrl-scroll lock etc,
but nothing else.  Ctrl-Alt-SysRq-S prints Emergency Sync, but doesn't
actually do it.  Ctrl-Alt-SysRq-B works.

According to Ctrl-Scroll lock it is in state R, but whether that is
reliable given that the kernel has died I'm not sure.

sda6 is /home.  It only dies if there is no swap.

Yes.  That looks like it.  I'll try Kevin Buhr's patch and see if that 
helps.
