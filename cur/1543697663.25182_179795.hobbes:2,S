Well, given that it could be any release, pre-release, vendor, or
local-patched kernel since 2.2.something, even if you found one with a
BUG at raid5.c:337 you couldn't be sure that you had found the right
one, the only suggestion that I would have, assuming the owner of the
machine wanted a suggestion, is "Upgrade to a current kernel".
