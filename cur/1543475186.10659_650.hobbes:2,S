If gcc could be IO-bound, you'd have a great benchmark.
You could get a 450 MHZ Xeon or 666 MHz Alpha with old IDE drives,
or slow down your IO in software to adjust for a normal CPU.
There might be a place in the block device code where you could add
a nice delay. You could get the NFS swap patches and use a PPP link
over a 14.4 modem. I suspect that would make gcc highly IO-bound.
If you had the kernel log user IO operations and page faults, you
could have a benchmark play back gcc IO behavior without all the
normal CPU usage.
