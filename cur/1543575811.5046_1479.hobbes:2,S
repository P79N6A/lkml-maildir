Maybe... I definitely agree that 14 is below the limit, but 30... Hell knows,
from what I see on the box I'm using right now it seems to fall into several
cathegories:
	* Very-Long-And-Verbose-Named-HOWTO.html
	* manpages for X and Tcl functions with obscenely long names
	* *.deb and corresponding *.diff.gz and *.dsc
	* var/state/apt/lists/*
	* ghostscript maps
Hmm... Cutoff seems to sit somewhere around 45 - above that there are only
apt-get droppings and they definitely are over the top. Dunno, you may be
right, but looks like I never had a need to create anything that long.
