Yes, provided as you say that you don't mount the file systems involved;
mounting them will make journalling filesystems run their recoveries,
which will in turn make the suspend image inconsistent. It's only really
viable if the filesystems were mounted read only to start with... I've
just added functionality to the 2.4 version for such a case.
