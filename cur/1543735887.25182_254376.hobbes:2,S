Could it be a config problem?  My config file was from 'allnoconfig', I think, and has
$ egrep 'SYSV|COMPAT' .config
CONFIG_COMPAT=y
# CONFIG_SYSVIPC is not set
compat_sys_shmctl is in ipc/compat.c, and is enabled by CONFIG_SYSVIPC_COMPAT,
which depends on CONFIG_SYSVIPC, which is off.
The reference to compat_sys_shmctl seems to be in
./arch/ia64/ia32/sys_ia32.c
./arch/ppc64/kernel/sys_ppc32.c
./arch/x86_64/ia32/ipc32.c
./arch/s390/kernel/compat_linux.c
and appears to not be conditioned on CONFIG_SYSVIPC_COMPAT.
Seems like linking problems are expected unless you turn on
CONFIG_SYSVIPC and CONFIG_SYSVIPC_COMPAT.
I turned 'em on and am trying again.
