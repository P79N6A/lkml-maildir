I apologise for wasting your time with this post but i think you guys
definately need a pat on the back.  I'm still a newbie to C but i've been
on this list for several months and have been watching all the
developments emerge on this list, you guys are doing a great job.  I'm
amazed at how quickly bugs get taken care of and how much work gets
accomplished here and i hope to join you someday in hacking the linux
kernel, you all have been a great inspiration to me to keep on
learning.  Even though I'm not able to contribute yet, reading this
list makes me feel like a part of the community.  Keep up the great work!
p.s. once again I apologise for the off-topic post but with all the work
you guys put into the os I use I thought i should show my appreciation.
