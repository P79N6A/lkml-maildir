It was taking the effect of memory barriers into account.  In the program
"load(A); store(B)" the load doesn't sequentially precede the store.  But
in the program "load(A); smp_mb(); store(B)" it does.  Similarly, in the
program "if (A) B = 2;" the load(A) sequentially precedes the store(B) --
thanks to the dependency or (if you prefer) the absence of speculative
stores.
Basically "sequentially precedes" means that any other CPU using the
appropriate memory barriers will observe the accesses apparently occurring
in this order.

Yes, I realize that.  But if several CPUs store values to the same
variable at about the same time, it's not at all clear which stores are
"<v" others.  Deciding this is tantamount to ordering all the stores to
that variable.

Exactly.  That's why I'm not too comfortable with your "<v" -- and I'm not 
completely certain of the validity of "comes before" either.  Hardly 
surprising, since they mean pretty much the same thing.
