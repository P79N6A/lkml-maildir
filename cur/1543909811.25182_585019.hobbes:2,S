Please, no more of these kinds of macros.  We have already had
collisions.  Go ahead and redefine the efi_info structure if necessary,
but use fixed types (u8, u16, u32, u64), *NOT* unsigned long which is
different between i386 and x86-64.  Also keep in mind the boot code
might in the future be compiled with a 16-bit compiler, so assuming
"unsigned int" == 32 bits is also a Bad Thing.
