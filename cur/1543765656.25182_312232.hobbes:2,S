I don't believe that was ever true, though it can fairly trivially be added.
JLC, please note that entropy estimation is much more conservative now
than it was a month ago.

I've been moving in that direction already, most of the infrastructure
is already in place.

That's not quite right. It needs 8 bits in the relevant output pool.
Failing that, it needs 64 bits in the input pool to reseed the output
pool. In the case of /dev/urandom, it needs 128 bits in the input
pool, it always leaves enough for /dev/random to reseed.
