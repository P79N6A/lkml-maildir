The original is at
http://seclists.org/lists/linux-kernel/2005/May/0447.html,
 as indicated
by the footnote in my original message.
That said, it's identical in content to the one I've just sent (attached
as a text/plain MIME attachment.)

I don't think James sent any patch in the original thread with Jens'
patch. But that sounds somewhat cleaner than msleep().
At any rate, the current patch (with or without Jens' new addition)
works for me on Thinkpad T43. So the net result is better anyway, IMO.

Is the kludginess of Jens' addition the only problem you have with the
current patch? (If it is, then fixing this is out of the range of my
current ability...)
Thanks for responding.
