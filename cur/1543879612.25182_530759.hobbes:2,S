Doesn't help.
Maybe interesting:
In the init=/bin/bash run, the first suspend try was without swap
and thus bailed out. After swapon, the second try already hung,
despite not having 'really' suspended at all on the first try.
I tried it once more, with swap on the first try and got the same
'second try doesn't work' result.
