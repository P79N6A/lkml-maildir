I don't know if anyone has actually measured the relative performance, but
I'd expect the answer to be the same as 2.4.  There is a small but
measurable performance penalty for enabling highmem which is higher than
the benefit of the extra 128 meg of memory you get when you have 1G.  If
you have more than 1G it's better to enable highmem.
