So what do you suggest? You can see from the logs that the device
is having difficulty  reading your damaged CD. You can do what
Windows-95 does (ignore the errors and pretend everything is fine),
or what Windows-98 and Windows-2000/Prof does (blue-screen, and re-boot),
or you can try like hell to read the files like Linux does. What do you
suggest?
Cheers,
