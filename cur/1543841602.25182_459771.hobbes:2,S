OK, so the page has data in it, and is in the page cache.  The
hypervisor kills the page, gives the notification to the kernel that the
page has gone away, and the kernel marks PG_discarded.  There still
might be active references to the page.
So, is the problem trying to communicate with the reference holders that
the page is no longer valid?  How is this fundamentally different from
page truncating?

How about doing it in the NUMA node?  Or the mem_section?  Or, even a
bit in the mem_map[] for the area guarding the 'struct page' itself?
Even a hashed table of locks based on the page address.  You just need
something that allows _some_ level of concurrency.  You certainly never
have a number of CPUs which is anywhere close to the number of 'struct
page's in the system.
Let me think more about (3).
