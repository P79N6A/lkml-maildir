This looks wrong. You already have a kernel interface to serial drivers.
It is called a line discipline. We use it for ppp, we use it for slip, we
use it for a few other things such as attaching sync drivers to some
devices.
Discussions of the form  "my line discipline has no way to do 'xyz'" are
the ones that need to happen IMHO.
