Hmm, you seems to prefer depth-first search algorithm?
I like it too. :-)

We can do bisection in EC0.UPDT to find out which statement cause hang?
Hmm, we are going to fix BIOS. :-)
My assumption is that since Windows works well, then these BIOS code
should have been tested ok. The only possible excuse for BIOS is that
Linux is using unnecessary/untested code path for Suspend/resume.
So, Eventually, we need to disable unnecessary BIOS call for
suspend/resume
