Guess
#if __GNUC__ == 3 && __GNUC_MINOR__ < 3
#error Your compiler is too buggy; it is known to miscompile kernels.
#error    Known good compilers: 3.3, 3.4, 4.0
#endif
would be better.  __GNUC__ < 2 will certainly be errored about in other
places and it is bad to suggest compilers that are no longer supported
as known good ones.
