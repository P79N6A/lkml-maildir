Survived and survived....
I had a drive lose power (flaky connector) in a 4 drive setup (2x hpt370 dual channel controllers, each with a 30G IBM ide-drive on each channel - Using IDE and Raid-patches for 2.2.17). The result was a readable, but unwritable array. A streamed mp3 played flawlessly while the drive 'died', while my download (over smb) just froze.
Rebuilding the array (after a reboot) went ok, but during rebuild the 'new' drive appeared to be drive #5 in the 4-disk set, with drive #3 still dead.

Seems to work ok on 2.2.17 at least (had problems with 2.2.19 as detailed previously) - untried with 2.2.20 or 2.4 so far.
It's fun tho :-)
