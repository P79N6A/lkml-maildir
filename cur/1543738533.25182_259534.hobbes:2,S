Is that considered good? I like RedHat, but they are well known for doing 
things of dubious taste.
But I just dislike the whole "stopped dead because of the state of the disk" 
thing. I mean, sure, if there large amounts of stuff just missing, it might be 
hard to get anything done, but it sure would be nice if the kernel would try 
really hard to get to a shell so I can figure out what the problem is.
If the initrd gets corrupted, are we just hosed?
