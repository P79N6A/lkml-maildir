	Yes. If user thread which generates dirty pages need in
reclaimed memory it consider own dirty page as candidate for page-out.
It functions as before patching.
> Intent of this is to throttle writers.
I suppose you means dirtier or write(2) caller but not writepage()
caller. The dirtier  is throttled  with backing_dev_info logic as before
patching. 
	While pdflush thread sorts pages for page-out it does not
consider as a candidate a page to be written with congested queue.
Pdflush thread functions as before patching. Pdflush tends to make pages
un-dirty without overload memory or IO and it is not need to let pdflush
do page-out with congested queue as you have proposed.

Indeed, it *interferes* with it: in the original code, process doing
direct reclaim during balance_dirty_pages()
 
generic_file_write()->balance_dirty_pages()->...->__alloc_pages()->...->
pageout()
performs page-out even if queue is congested. Intent of this is to
throttle writers, and reduce risk of running oom (certain file systems,
especially ones with delayed allocation, tend to allocate a lot of
memory in balance_dirty_pages()->writepages() paths).
Your patch breaks this mechanism.
Nikita.
