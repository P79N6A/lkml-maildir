Yes. Need to talk to Neterion about MSI-X support for their 10Gige
product. I expect Intel's 10Gige also can make use of MSI-X.
One of the key things MSI-X was expected to do was distribute
seperate TX/RX "queues" (aka descriptor rings) across CPUs.
As such, each CPU would "own" a set of queues.
I don't know if the 10GigE cards were in fact able to implement
this functionality. But I would like to know if they did/do.
thanks
