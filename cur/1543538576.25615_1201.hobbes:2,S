Argh. I thought it was checking at sectors-1 anyway. - This obviously
needs to be changed ASAP. Everybody knows/should know that only WinNT 3.x
used sectors/2 and WinNT4 + 2k use sectors-1 (I think this is stated in
Regis <can't spell surname> infos).

I am well aware of the operational concepts of the LFS+NTFS. And your
reasoning is also the same why I think there is corruption by not handling
the journal. - Seing the patents issue which I was not aware off, I now
think that the implementation for the linux driver will be without the
journal BUT when mounting a volume read/write, we will scan the journal
and check whether it is as it were "empty", i.e. a proper shutdown has
occured. - If yes then everything is fine since NT/2k will stop after the
analysis pass, or at least the redo and undo passes will have nothing to
do (that's my understanding of it). If however the system was not shutdown
properly we will either (user selectable mount option maybe?):
- tell the user that she/he needs to mount the volume under NT/2k and run
chkdsk on it (we can set the chkdsk flag if it is not set but it shouldn't
be required since the NTFS+LFS will operate regardless but chkdsk might
fix some more things [refering to bit 1, run chkdsk on mount]). We would
then mount read-only and refuse r/w mounting.
- ignore the contents of the journal but mark it as empty anyway or
completely get rid of it. - This is a nasty way of doing things, since it
will result in data corruption due to log file contents not being
redone/undone but it will stop the corruption due to windows
redoing/undoing things randomly from an inconsistent journal.
Thinking about this, the first option should probably be the one to
implement since the second will cause data corruption and we don't want
that...

I actually did some comparisons between NTFS v1.2 and NTFS v3.0 partitions
and the way they are dealt with by NT/2k last weekend and found something
interesting: NT4 when it sees a v3.0 NTFS parititon sets the 4th bit
(=0x8) in the volume flags field. - I think that this is to signal win2k
that an older NTFS driver has written to the new version NTFS partition.
Win2k then presumably will take this into consideration and "fix" the NT4
caused corruption. - Assuming this is the only signal required then
setting this bit in the Linux driver should fix the corruption
(disregarding journalling based corruption and overwritting system
data corruption and any other bugs in the driver of course...)
I was unable to complete my experimenting since Win2k decided to commit
suicide on the system partition and even though it did a clean shutdown it
refused to mount the partition again afterwards and the only way to read
the partition now is using your diskedit utility from my NT4 install
(which refuses to display the mounted partition stating there are errors). 
Diskedit does work and I can't see anything immediately wrong with it
apart from the two MFT copies are inconsistent.  )-: Anyway a reinstall is
probably required here but I might first try to copy one of the MFTs on
top of the other and see what happens first... [Note this is not the linux
driver or NT4 at fault, since I only rebooted the computer and haven't
done any writting to the partition in between and I never write mount the
system partition on linux anyway...]
