Hmmm... could you explain more?  You're saying that every load is
an "acquire" and every store a "release"?  Or that they can be flagged
that way, but aren't always?
Does this means that an "acquire" means "all accesses after this insn
(in the code stream) must occur after this insn (in time)"?  Does
that only apply to the address that instruction touched, or all?
Confused,
Rusty.
