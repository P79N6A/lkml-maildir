Building  2.3.14 on a Compaq ES40.
Did someone miss updating ./include/asm-alpha/smp.h.  It tries to include
linux/tasks.h, which no longer exists. It should be linux/threads.h, I
believe?

Dr. Allan B. MacIsaac                 There once was an old man from Esser,
Dept. of Applied Math                 Whose knowledge grew lesser and lesser.
University of Western Ontario         It at last grew so small,
London, Ontario, Canada               That he knew nothing at all,
