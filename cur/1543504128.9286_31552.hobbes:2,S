Hello Paul,

   lspci reports interrupt pins of PCI slots which are routed
by motherboard circuitry to interrupt pins of the chipset, so
it's quite possible pin A of the particular "slot" corresponds
to chipset pin C.

   I believe the scenario is following:
	o  X don't use interrupts at all (one of the reasons is that
	   they just cannot :-)), but they by mistake enable interrupts
	   on the graphics card (for example completion of accelerator
	   command or something similar).
	o  PCI IRQ's are level-sensitive, so any card drives the
	   interrupt line active as long as the condition causing
	   the interrupt lasts (== the interrupt hasn't been handled
	   by the driver yet).
	o  If nobody else than X uses the IRQ, everything goes well
	   since the IRQ is not enabled on the interrupt controller
	   at all.
	o  If the kernel enables the IRQ on the interrupt controller
	   and the X server causes the video card IRQ to appear,
	   kernel interrupt routine is executed, but the video card
	   IRQ is not handled since there's nobody interested in it,
	   the interrupt handler returns, but the card still has
	   a pretty good reason for holding the IRQ line active,
	   so an interrupt is generated again ... ad infinitum.
   Recent releases of XFree servers have some of these bugs fixed,
but I cannot be sure none remain.
				Have a nice fortnight
