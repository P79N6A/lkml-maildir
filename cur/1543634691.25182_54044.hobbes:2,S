I've been accused of this, so I'll state for the record: my views on
locking are not efficiency-related in the least. They have to do with
ensuring that locks protect well-defined data and that locking
constructs are clean (e.g. nonrecursive and no implicit drop or acquire).
My duties are not directly related to locking, and I only push the
agenda I do as a low-priority kernel janitoring effort. As this is not
a scalability issue, I'll not press it further in this thread.
Cheers,
Bill
