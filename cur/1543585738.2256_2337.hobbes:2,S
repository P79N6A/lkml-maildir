Well, it's rpm ...
I guess the Debian packager is more friendly.
But if you choose to install a huge number of packages, the job to do for
the package manager (dependencies ...) is no trivial to do with few resources.
But that's not the point of the discussion.
Kernel related questions IMHO are:
(1) Why do we get into OOM? Can we avoid it?
(2) Is OOM sometimes misdetected (or triggered too early) and why?
(3) Does the OOM killer choose the right processes?
