I tested your patches on the x86 architecture and report the results.
It is no problem except for the above problem.
I think that it is useful to use configfs(especially, mkdir and rmdir 
because of adding/removing netconsole_target).
I am going to test the your next iteration patches on x86 and IA64 
architecutures. 
Thanks
