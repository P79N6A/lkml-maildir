With the waiting 10s patch backed out, things seem to be going well:
$ ssh analyticity

Linux analyticity 2.6.11-rc1-mm1 #5 SMP Sat Jan 15 01:25:23 PST 2005 sparc64 GNU/Linux
$ uptime
 14:10:55 up 10 min,  7 users,  load average: 0.10, 0.40, 0.31
Now I just have to remember to set up ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev
eth3 via 192.168.1.1 instead of just ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev
eth3 so I can tftpboot the thing (well, it took all of 10s to figure
out, but it may not next time). Routing changes are painful.
