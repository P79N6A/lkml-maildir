That may be a bug actually.  Looking at ll_rw_blk.c:
        unsigned long bounce_pfn = dma_addr >> PAGE_SHIFT;
        if (bounce_pfn < blk_max_low_pfn) {
        blk_max_low_pfn = max_low_pfn;
dma_addr are physical addresses, so bounce_pfn is referenced to a PFN0
equal to physical address 0.  This implies that blk_max_low_pfn is
likewise, as is max_low_pfn.

However, here, max_low_pfn of zero corresponds with the PFN of
PHYS_OFFSET.  We have something with two different origins being
compared, which is nonsense.  So something is wrong somewhere,
and my money is on max_low_pfn.
