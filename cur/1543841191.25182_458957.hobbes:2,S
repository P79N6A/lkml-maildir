Unfortunately, this situation is even more difficult for me, because it's
getting very hard to track patches that get applied, rejected, modified or
obsoleted, which is even more true when people don't always think about
sending an ACK after the patch finally gets in. I already have a few pending
patches in my queue waiting for an ACK that will have to be tracked if the
persons do not respond, say, within one week. Otherwise I might simply lose
them.
I think that the good method would be to :
  - announce the patch
  - find a volunteer to port it
  - apply it once the volunteer agrees to handle it
This way, no code gets lost because there's always someone to track it.
