The file is compiled with -traditional. The ellipses (for optionality) are a
GNU extension. The kernel contains the bug. Not gcc.
The kernel gurus agree that the kernel is broken and not GCC.

Applying patches, adding scripts, etc sure sounds like a new version to me.
And the kernel that ships with RedHat 7 is 2.2.16 + patches and is
called (by them) 2.2.16-22 (which is what uname reports too). This kernel
has numerous advantages over 2.2.17.

It doesn't. 17 doesn't included 1/4 of what is in RedHat's 2.2.16-22 and
2.2.16-22 doesn't include everything in 2.2.17 (it's called testing and
avoiding shipping software they haven't tested).
RedHat has no control over what goes into the mainline 2.2.n. 
You are completely nuts if you think that distributions should wait
for a feature to appear in the mainline before including it in their
distribution. 
Doing so would certainly have a negative effect on the development of the
mainline kernel due to pressure to include features that are not ready for
the mainline.
Distributors have different goals from the mainline kernel developers, and
thus they ship different kernels.
