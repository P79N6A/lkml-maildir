What happens if you put a section at zero and a section at non-fixed
address (aligned). In the asm macros you stick the variable in both,
using the zero based one for linker symbols and the non zero based one
for data, then discard the zero based one.
That used to work for old binutils which didn't care/spot if you were
discarding material you actually linked against. Not sure what todays
binutils does with it.
