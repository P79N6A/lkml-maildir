Yes, as well as 12 committee members, of which 5 didn't even comply with
their own git commit requirement last time I checked. Not to mention the
10 seats sold to sponsors (presuming it goes like in previous years,
with each sponsor being awarded one grease slot per sponsorship).
Based on the published list of invitees (which didn't seem to include
the seats sold off) that means 25% of the people who can vote for the
TAB were not given a vote based on their contributions.
Of course this matches the voting system in some countries, but just
because a lot of places rely on broken systems, that shouldn't encourage
the TAB to do the same.
