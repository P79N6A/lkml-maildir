Now fixed, please see 
http://ds9a.nl/futex-manpages
 - but please realise I'm
somewhat out of my depth. Comments welcome.
Futexes have mutated into complicated things, I wonder if this was the last
of the changes needed.
The big change in the manpages is the addition of FUTEX_REQUEUE and
FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE. Furthermore, I realised that the futex system call does
not return EAGAIN etc, it returns -EAGAIN. I guesstimated that CMP_REQUEUE
will be merged before 2.6.7.
To clarify the overloaded situation wrt the futex syscall, I split it up in
three prototypes. 
Ulrich, does/will glibc provide a futex(2) function? Or should people just
call the syscall themselves? 
There were also some complaints I did not address futexfs but as far as I
can see, it is a kernel internal matter of no interest to userspace coders?
