The thing is that there is _no_ contention in the example. I.e. I'll say
that access to these variables is serialized - it will not change the
example. The problem is that there is an implicit dependency between
variables because of the way they were placed in the file.

PS I do agree that making A local would be better in the example. However
this is just an example..
PSS Does anyone know of any kind of computationally intensive
multithreaded  software package/benchmark to test out whether this is
noticable or not ?
