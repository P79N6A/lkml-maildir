Absolutely.

Now that I like. Especially if coupled with the equivalent for dequeuing a
signal with implicit locking too, so I really can drop all references to 
current->sigmask_lock -- the JFFS2 garbage collection thread dequeues 
signals and deals as you might expect with SIGSTOP/SIGKILL:
	for (;;) {
		spin_lock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
		siginitsetinv (&current->blocked, sigmask(SIGHUP) | sigmask(SIGKILL) | sigmask(SIGSTOP) | sigmask(SIGCONT));
		recalc_sigpending();
		spin_unlock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
		if (!thread_should_wake(c)) {
                        set_current_state (TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
			D1(printk(KERN_DEBUG "jffs2_garbage_collect_thread sleeping...\n"));
			/* Yes, there's a race here; we checked thread_should_wake() before
			   setting current->state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. But it doesn't
			   matter - We don't care if we miss a wakeup, because the GC thread
			   is only an optimisation anyway. */
			schedule();
		}
                
		cond_resched();
                /* Put_super will send a SIGKILL and then wait on the sem. 
                 */
                while (signal_pending(current)) {
                        siginfo_t info;
                        unsigned long signr;
                        spin_lock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
                        signr = dequeue_signal(&current->blocked, &info);
                        spin_unlock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
                        switch(signr) {
                        case SIGSTOP:
                                D1(printk(KERN_DEBUG "jffs2_garbage_collect_thread(): SIGSTOP received.\n"));

				spin_lock_bh(&c->erase_completion_lock);
                                c->gc_task = NULL;

			case SIGHUP:

				break;
			default:
