Indeed. The main problem, however, for me was to decide which IRQ to use
for the HPET. The HPET has a big mask of allowable IRQs, the APIC has
many pins - so how to decide which one to use and if possible not share
it with a PCI device?

Well, the number of interrupts if you have IO-APICs (or SAPICs) is
almost unlimited ... and usually on the IO-APIC that handles the PC
legacy there are some spare pins. Nevermind, I don't think it'd be a
huge problem to share the timer interrupt pin with some device.

Well, the driver is supposed to reenable the interrupt as soon as it can
(possibly disabling the card itself from generating further interrupts),
so it's back to bad drivers even in this case.

That'd work probably. I don't believe there will ever be systems with
HPET and without a working IOAPIC. But, well, insane things do happen.
As for the user disabling it, we could disable HPET then, too. Anyway, I
agree with your proposal of first going for legacy mode and doing native
mode later. 
(PS. It's a pretty stupid thing in the HPET spec to only be able to
 gobble up BOTH the PIT and RTC interrupts and not separately.)
