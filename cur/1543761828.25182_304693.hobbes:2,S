We ended up deciding that this was a bug in the e100 NAPI implementation.
I have a not-very-official patch in -mm, at
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.12-rc1/2.6.12-rc1-mm1/broken-out/e100-napi-state-machine-fix.patch.
Would you be able to test that?
AFAIK there has been no official fix for this yet.
