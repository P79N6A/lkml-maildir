Subject: [PATCH 003 of 10] md: Fix bug that stops raid5 resync from happening
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/1/7

As data_disks is *less* than raid_disks, the current test here is
obviously wrong.  And as the difference is already available in
conf->max_degraded, it makes much more sense to use that.
