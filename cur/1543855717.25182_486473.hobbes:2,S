That was the order-9 allocation failure. Which is not going to be
solved properly by just dropping caches.
But Sonic apparently saw failures with 4K allocations, where the
caches weren't getting shrunk properly. This would be more interesting
because it would indicate a real problem with the kernel.

Thanks, I'll give that one a try.
