OK then this should be done of course, since I fear that we will not
move all supported cards (since they are not longer sold) to the new driver.

So maybe it could be a good start point to do the transition for one
card first, maybe nj_s.c is OK to start.

If you do that for one card, I will test it and change the rest.
Thanks for your help.
