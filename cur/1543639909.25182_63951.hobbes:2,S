Does "complete" mean all the ports have also made the change and been merged back?

I don't think it's good policy to have the $ and non-$ cases behaving
differently if we can avoid it.

Tell me about it ;-) Actually the incidence of this is low, presumably

fixed.  I found only a half-dozen or so of these.
I'm more concerned about subtle dependencies on execution order resulting
from misuse of conditionals.
