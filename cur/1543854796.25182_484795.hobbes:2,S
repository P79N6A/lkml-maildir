As you all know SystemTap uses kprobes and relayfs as the basis which 
are already merged into the mainline.
We are looking at all the other pieces of SystemTap that can be merged 
to mainline but as Alan mentioned it is not easy and obvious. We think 
we can merge transport part of the runtime, here is the initial patch 
under review in this thread
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/systemtap/2006-q4/msg00031.html
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/systemtap/2006-q4/msg00030.html
We are open for other suggestions as well.
