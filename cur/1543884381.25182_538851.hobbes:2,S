gcc has an algorithm that tends to generate a near perfect shift/add etc.
code sequence and also knows the obvious x / y ==> x*1/y
However it doesn't do that with -Os, prefering smaller code on x86
(idiv is fairly small compared to the expanded sequences for non power
of two dividends) and kernels are usually compiled with -Os these
days.
We've had a few cases in the past where this showed up as regression
against older kernels that still used -O2.

It is. However a few more complex transformations I would have liked
in the past are missing -- in particular 
x / (cond ? const1 : const2) ==> cond ? (x / const1) : (x / const2)
