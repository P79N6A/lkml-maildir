I was seeing the same thing too, for a while.  Now, my NT box doesn't
stay up long enough to really run a test.
One thing a friend down the road has done to work around this problem
(because he requires 24/7 uninterrupted service) is to daemonize a df
process in a while loop:
#!/bin/sh
while : ; do
  {
    df --sync --type=smbfs >> /dev/null;
    sleep 123;
  };
done
This would cause NT to think that something was actually accessing the
share, and interpret it as activity.  For some reason "ls" doesn't do
that, probably because dir info is cached on the client, and so doesn't
always access the physical NT share when performed.
What would be nice is for samba to check every once in a while that
shares are still mounted, and if they aren't, remount them, or generate
a solid "keepalive", or something.  Also nice would be if smbmount
detects the IO error, to check if the share is unavailable, and if it is
unavailable, to automatically unmount the share.  As it is, you have to
su to root and do a umount on the directory that is supposedly mounted,
because smbumount won't work in this case.
If you look in the kernel code, you can see where the log error messages
are generated, but I'm still not sure how the kernel knows to generate
those messages...i.e., where/when the smbfs message functions get called
from, and after what check.
