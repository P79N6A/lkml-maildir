Hi all,
This is another story of "the chip-vendor provides driver support and is 
waiting for device to hit the market". 
DiBcom knows that there are devices out there that are using the dib7000m 
in way that they need the dib7000m_i2c_enumeration to work properly. But 
it is impossible to know the devices in advance. This function is there 
for the case a user or developper needs it to add support for his board.
Patrick.
