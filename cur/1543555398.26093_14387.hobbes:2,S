Not that I like it, but I need to boot Win98, and then warm boot into
Linux, or the Cardbus is not working.  This is using Linux-2.4.0-test11 on
a Mitac 7233 laptop.
Using lspci, I can see that the secondary and subordinate busses of the
Cardbus bridges are unconfigured/incorrect. I have attached dmesg and
lspci -vvvxxx output from the two cases (ok=Win98+warm-boot and
fail=cold-boot). I have enabled all PCI debug things I could find. Bw, it
would be really nice to have ONE place to enable the PCI debug info.
Any advice?
