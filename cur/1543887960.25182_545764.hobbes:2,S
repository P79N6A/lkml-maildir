The skb pointer should be brand-spanking new/fresh. 
It is passed to spidernet by the netdev->hard_start_xmit
callback:
    netdev->hard_start_xmit = &spider_net_xmit;
I'd expect that anything that hard_start_xmit() passed to 
a device driver should have a fully valid skb.  Locking
problems in spidernet could cause it to work with the wrong 
skb; however, in this case, the skb pointer is passed 
unmodified, directly to the spot where it fails.
Maybe there is some "make ip header fresh and clean on skb" call
that should have been made; if so, I don't know what it is.
