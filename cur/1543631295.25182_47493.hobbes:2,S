Yeep. Now I even remember from the dust of my mind,
that there is a *direct mapping*
between terminal settings and ioctl numbers present in
the line discipine code. So ioctl is definitively the way to
go.
BTW.> Did I mention today that the XFree86 people are
indeed the sane ones and always choose the most
UNIX a like and proper interfaces apparently?
!Marvelously good work over a long time out there!
(Well not for font issues, in esp. in an i18n context,
but that's another story...)
