Subject: Bug: NFS and MSDOS filesystem

I've encountered what seems to be a bug in the interaction between NFS
and the MSDOS filesystem.  The symptom is that when I access an MSDOS
filesystem over my ethernet via NFS (both systems are running Linux),
the files are corrupted: certain sequences of bytes are copied twice.  I
also verified that executing wc on the same file both natively and over
NFS yields different results.  I don't have similar problems with ext2fs
files.
The problem showed up when I attempted to use the Emacs mailreader on a
mail file stored in a remote MSDOS filesystem and I discovered that many
messages, including their headers, were corrupted.  The corruption does
not show up if I use the Emacs mailreader on the system where the mail
files are actually stored.
Some more details about my environment.
System A (`russula') is running the 2.0.32 kernel, with the environment
based on the Slackware distribution.  System B (`pleurotus') is running
the 2.0.32 kernel, with the environment based on the SuSE 5.3
distribution.  The MSDOS filesystem (dos_e) is mounted on russula.  Thus
pleurotus is running the client and russula is running the server.  I
don't have the problem if I reverse the relationship, making pleurotus
the server and russula the client.  I have tried mounting dos_e both
with and without CR/LF translation; I get the corruption either way
(though I normally run with translation on).
