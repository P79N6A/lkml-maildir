At which version of the kernel did the aacraid driver allegedly first go broken? At which version did it get fixed? (Since 1.1.5-2451 is older than latest represented on kernel.org)
How is the SATA disk'd arrayed on the aacraid controller? The controller is limited to generating 24 arrays and since /dev/sdac is the 29th target, it would appear we need more details on your array's topology inside the aacraid controller. If you are using the driver with aacraid.physical=1 and thus using the physical drives directly (in the case of a SATA disk, a SATr0.9 translation in the Firmware), this is not a supported configuration and was added only to enable limited experimentation. If there is a problem in that path in the driver, I will glad to fix it, but still unsupported.
You may need to acquire a diagnostic dump from the controller (Adaptec technical support can advise, it will depend on your application suite) and a report of any error recovery actions reported by the driver in the system log as initiated by the SCSI subsystem.
There are no changes in the I/O path for the aacraid driver. Due to the simplicity of the I/O path to the processor based controller, it is unlikely to be an issue in this path. There have been several changes in the driver to deal with error recovery actions initiated by the SCSI subsystem. One likely candidate was to extend the default SCSI layer timeout because it was shorter than the adapter's firmware timeout. You can check if this is the issue by manually increasing the timeout for the target(s) via sysfs. There were recent patches to deal with orphaned commands resulting from devices being taken offline by the SCSI layer. There has been changes in the driver to reset the controller should it go into a BlinkLED (Firmware Assert) state. The symptom also acts like a condition in the older drivers (pre 08/08/2006 on scsi-misc-2.6, showing up in 2.6.20.4) which did not reset the adapter when it entered the BlinkLED state and merely allowed the system to lock, but alas you are working with a driver with this reset fix in the version you report. A BlinkLED condition generally indicates a serious hardware problem or target incompatibility; and is generally rare as they are a result of corner case conditions within the Adapter Firmware. The diagnostic dump reported by the Adaptec utilities should be able to point to the fault you are experiencing if these appear to be the root causes.
