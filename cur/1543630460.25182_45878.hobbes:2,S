Hi,
we managed to hang the kernel with a db/2 stress test on s/390. The test
was done on 2.4.7 but the problem is present on all recent 2.4.x and 2.5.x
kernels (all architectures). In short a schedule is done while holding
the shm_lock of a shared memory segment. The system call that caused
this has been sys_ipc with IPC_RMID and from there the call chain is
as follows: sys_shmctl, shm_destroy, fput, dput, iput, truncate_inode_pages,
truncate_list_pages, schedule. The scheduler picked a process that called
sys_shmat. It tries to get the lock and hangs.
One way to fix this is to remove the schedule call from truncate_list_pages:

Another way is to free the lock before calling fput in shm_destroy but the
comment says that this functions has to be called with shp and shm_ids.sem
locked. Comments?
