I've done so in the past, after you first told me of your wish, so it is no
pattern. Also I'll try to do so again in future -- I just missed it this

Patches are sent to linux-pcmcia for review. As noted above, before and in
private communication, I'll try to remember to CC all others who might have
an interest in the patches.
