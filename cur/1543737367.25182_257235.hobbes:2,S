Ouch.  Having slept over it I awoke this morning with the realization that 
there is in fact another bug, which would definitely cause exactly the BUG 
check to trigger that Dino reported.  )-:  Sorry about that.  Just goes to 
show that when I was porting my code from libntfs to the kernel and 
thinking "wow, this is really too easy", I was actually missing the 
subtleties involved so I broke it.  )-:
Linus, please do a
	bk pull bk://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/ntfs-2.6
to apply the fix which is also shown below in diff style patch.  Thanks!
Dino, could you apply the below patch and just check that the bug goes 
away in case I have missed yet another problem...  I am pretty confident 
that this is it this time but you never know. (You can just add the lines 
"if (ni != base_ni) unmap_extent_mft_record(ni);" to fs/ntfs/attrib.c as 
shown in the patch.)  Thanks a lot in advance!
Note you also want the fix from my previous email as the two bugs/fixes 
are related...
Best regards,
	Anton

   NTFS: Fix another stupid bug in fs/ntfs/attrib.c::ntfs_external_attr_find()
         where we forgot to unmap the extent mft record when we had finished
         enumerating an attribute which caused a bug check to trigger when the
         VFS calls ->clear_inode.
