The problem is that on rdma route/address resolution the rdma core CM 
uses the routing table to look up which local device to use.  So what we 
need is separate ip subnets for rdma vs non rdma tcp.
Also, to avoid the original issue of 4-tuple conflicts, the rdma device 
_must_ listen on specific local "rdma-only" ip addresses and thus they 
must be not the same address as that used for native host tcp traffic.
