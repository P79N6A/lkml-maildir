Sorry for the long delay in replying; the HiNote needed some effort to get
the thing up and running again.  [Various bits of hardware are broken;
the power switch, floppy, and CD-ROM are busted/flakey.]  I've now got
Fedora Core 3 running on it. I was pleasantly surprised that the 2.6.9
i83265 PCMCIA module loads, and the internal Xircom CEM56 network/modem works.
[Broken with 2.6.10+ though; the fix is probably trivial.]
I wasn't sure exactly what to test.  I applied the following patch
to 2.6.11-rc3-bk9, and booted with i8042_debug=1.  So far, it works
as expected, and there is nothing of interest in the kernel log.
[Also worked with the FC3 2.6.9 kernel and this patch+DEBUG.]
Now that things are up and running, I will apply any patches that you
would like tested.
