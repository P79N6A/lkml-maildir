Subject: 2.4.0-test3: undefined references due to 64 bit arithmetic

	The following modules generate an undefined reference to
__udivdi3 as a result of trying to do 64-bit arithmetic in 2.4.0-test3.
The problem started occurring in 2.4.0-test3-pre9.  I did not report it
then becuase I thought I would develop a patch, but then 2.4.0-test3
was released, so I am taking a lesson from that and reporting the bug
now even though I might not have the time to fix it tonight.
