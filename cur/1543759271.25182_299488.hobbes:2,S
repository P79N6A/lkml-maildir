Hello,
i got some problems concerning tcp realization in kernel (v 2.4).
i need to make some modifications to tcp to be able to transfer data within ACK segments...(initially their data field is empty)
i suppose i should modify the following functions:
/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c > tcp_ack()  - for processing incoming acks, to read data from their data field
and
/net/ipv4/tcp_output.c > tcp_send_ack() - for processing outgoing acks, to put data in them
my questions are: 
 - am i right in my decision?
 - what problems these modifications may cause (i tried to modify and they do cause!... i just cannot understand what they are)
 - what functions else i may need to modify?
 - how must i modify ACKs to make them do what i want and to make linux kernel correctly treating them.
if you need i can reply the list of modifications i've done.
i'd like to be personally CC'd.
thanks in advance,
