You could try
# chown -R root: /usr/src/linux*
and check if it makes any difference.
Something similar showed up on linux-kernel some time ago:
it seems that tar finds those "strange" 1046/1046 values for uid/gid
and asks around (i.e. to NYS) for them, sleeping while waiting for an answer.

cp doesn't try to resolve uid/gid into names, tar does.
So this *could* be a point for my explanation.

I just sent my idea. Maybe I am wrong...
