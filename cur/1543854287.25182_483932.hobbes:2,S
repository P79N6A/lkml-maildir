Here's Linux 2.4.34-pre6.
Location: 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/testing/
Mostly cleanupts this time, as well as fixes for a few "&& 0xff"
typos. As I receivedthe RAM for my Alpha, I could attempt a few
builds with gcc-4.1 and fix 4 obvious problems (lvalue casts).
However, there are other problems somewhere else as the system
seems to hang on a pipe within the init scripts. I merged the
build fixes anyway so that people with more time can try to
chase the bugs down if they want.
Next version will be -rc1 and if everything goes well, I expect
to release 2.4.34 by the end of the year.
Regards,
Willy
