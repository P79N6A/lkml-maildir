As opposed to now when a new command comes along and the driver doesn't 
generate it until you update your kernel? Reading a CD doesn't take 
exotic commands, and given the choice of having users able to send 
arbitrary commands to the device and not access it at all, I would say 
"not at all" would be good.

There was a note on another list titled "Why did this work?" (from 
memory) where someone accidentally run a firmware update as a normal 
user and it worked. While this was a benign event, it points out that 
there is a hole here far beyond my earlier worry that someone would 
update a CD-RW.

So what is your solution? Or do you believe that allowing users to have 
unmonitored access to devices is acceptable?
Is this problem only in ide-cd, or does it affect other devices like 
ZIP, USB, etc, which do or may look like SCSI?
