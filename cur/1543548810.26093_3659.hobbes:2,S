} I spotted the curr = curr->next thing yesterday, too!  I think you're
} right on that one.  But I'm not sure about the head = &mapping thing. 
} The reason we jump back here is that we've been outside the spinlock'ed
} critical section.  Is it possible for the &mapping->pages to change
} during this period of time (when spinlock isn't held?), if not, your
} patch is ok.  If it could change, we need to re-initialize head because
} it could have changed while we didn't have the lock locked.
} 
Doh...Yeah. But...Shouldn't the `head = &mapping->pages;' thing be inside
of a spinlock if &mapping->pages could change? Say it changed between the
assignment and the function grabbing the lock?
Does anyone else know better on this?
