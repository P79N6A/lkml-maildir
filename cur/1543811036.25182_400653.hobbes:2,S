Well, if all of the pages that Nigel saves before snapshot are freeable in
theory, there evidently is something wrong with freeing in swsusp, as we
have a testcase in which the user was unable to suspend with swsusp due
to the lack of memory and could suspend with suspend2.
However, the only thing in swsusp_shrink_memory() that may be wrong
is we return -ENOMEM as soon as shrink_all_memory() returns 0.
Namely, if shrink_all_memory() can return 0 prematurely (ie. "there still are
some freeable pages, but they could not be freed in _this_ call"), we should
continue until it returns 0 twice in a row (or something like that).  If this
doesn't help, we'll have to fix shrink_all_memory() I'm afraid.
Greetings,
Rafael
