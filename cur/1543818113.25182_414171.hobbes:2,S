Sorry for the slow response.  My IBM email is temporarily dead.
Couple of things.  
First, is there anything useful that prepending UL to the constants does
to the functions?  It ends up looking a little messy to me.
Also, I thought you were going to put a big fat comment on there about
doing it correctly in the future.  It would also be nice to quantify the
wasted space in terms of bytes, just so that people get a feel for it.
Oh, and wait_table_size() needs a unit.  wait_table_size_bytes() sounds
like a winner to me.
