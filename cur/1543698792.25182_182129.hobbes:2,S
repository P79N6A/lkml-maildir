False start.  I've uploaded 8.00.00b8 to the SF site.  This driver
instructs the mid-layer to perform its initial scan with
scsi_scan_host().  During testing, I disable the scan.  Sorry for
the confusion.
BTW: a simple patch to fix the problem against b7 follows.  
Please dismiss 8.00.00b7 (I've since removed it from the SF site).
Regards,
Andrew Vasquez
