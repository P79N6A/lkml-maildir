I kinda did, in a polite manner. Perhaps I was to polite :)

Ok, this is very weird. I tried many times that first boot, and it
wouldn't crash what so ever. Ok, it came up with some errors, but I
couldn't get it to crash. After a recompile with debug enabled,
everything went totally nuts. It didn't crash, but if I pressed S (or
what ever key) I would get a screen full of that. Everything was crazy.
But still no crash. I rebootet, still same behavior. Then I turned of
debugging, and compiled again. And this time it started crashing again
(!). I have no idea why, but now it's like it have always been. I have
tried several times, used a fresh kerneltree, and patched again, no
help. Freezes just like before. I will try some more tomorrow (I'm going
to university in five hours), but I really can't understand what have
happened. 
Thanks anyway for you work :)
