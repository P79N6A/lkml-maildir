If fixing NFS is the main concern, and we're adding a new syscall,
could someone also add in an equivalent of the Solaris
etc. 'f_frsize'.
Reporting the underlying local filessystem block size can be of use
for some applications. On NFS this value usually differs from the
'optimal transfer block size' aka. f_bsize.
