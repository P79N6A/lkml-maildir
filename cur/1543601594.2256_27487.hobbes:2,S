OK, I got a bit farther with this. Now the GDM comes up with corrupted image
and mouse pointer moves, but the keyboard doesn't react to anything (num
lock led doesn't work when I hit numlock) and I can't do anything with
mouse.
Reiserfs is also broken (unable to mount partitions), from dmesg:
reiserfs kgetopt: there is not option
