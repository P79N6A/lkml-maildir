Well you could make it dependent on CONFIG_SLOW_KERNEL ;)
It's an act of faith - we have no benchmarks on this.  But it
goes like this:
- subroutine calls are fast
- cache misses are slow
- kernel has no right to be evicting user code from the CPU cache
- smaller is faster
- inlining to the point of increasing code size is probably wrong
