This all sounds like distro work to me. Distributions could put the
userland apps in place to allow "automagic" tuning, recompilation etc
based on questions asked of the user. This Supe-Me-Up app could even
download the latest _Distro_Tested_ kernel and use that as the basis of
the new tuned one. Really i don't see what any of this has to do with
Linux Kernel. Eric i'm not putting down your excellent work, but i really
don't see where this is going, Normal users should _never_ have to use
kernel.org trees.
