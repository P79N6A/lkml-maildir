Hi,
Well, I almost sure that this is not true, 
or maybe you are not using dosemu 1.4.0, and other one behaves differently.
Anyway, if I run dosemu 1.4.0 with that setting and stock freedos
command.com the cpu usage is well below 5%, and dosemu task is not reniced
There are even times that I forget that dosemu is running.
Also I don't know why but dosemu 1.4.0 has new sound system that is way better 
that 1.2 one, but it is not enabled so you need to set $_sound=(2) to get it,
what is nice is that this one uses SDL ( read alsa) for output, and has OPL3  
emulation, so MIDI plays out of box
