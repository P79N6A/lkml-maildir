I have detect a problem with that cards in several PII.
When i get that cards work really hard i get a message as:
"irq timeout ... etc" which get system go out without any network conecction.
The machine will work perfectly after that, but as i said the eth dont work
more.
It's fixed rebooting ...
I have after that just installing some DEC card getting same message.
It's all with 2.0.36....
2.2.1 have not driver for 100Mhz realtek eth cards, any reason?
do any know any about this "irq timeout" problems?
I got really lost after see i got same problem with Digital eth cards.
