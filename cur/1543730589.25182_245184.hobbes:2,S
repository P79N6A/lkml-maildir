The top-level pages work, but the ones for accessing
actual files don't work due to 403 errors. For instance,
http://zeus.instmath.rwth-aachen.de/~heine/ftape/archives/
accessible from Archive -> click on location for HTTP,
doesn't work. Clicking on the FTP location gets a 530
(Login Incorrect) error. Several files are announced as
links into the archives directory, and are not accessible,
like the ChangeLog and FAQ (in the Development page).
However, the old web address is even more broken, so I
guess it's better to list the new one.
