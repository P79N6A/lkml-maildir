Does it have to be limited ot information that the kernel already has?
In particular, I'm thinking of the SCSI standard inquiry and EVPD
inquiry pages.  Mike Sullivan's patch does some SCSI inquiries and
extracts information from the results.  I'm wondering if the SCSI
driver could just do all of the available EVPD inquiries (available
pages are listed in the TOC on EVPD inquiry page 0), and use driverfs
to expose all of that (binary) information.
Right now the inquiries can be done from userspace using an ioctl().
peace & happiness,
martin
