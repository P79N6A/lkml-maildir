that was completely not my point - I was merely trying to point out that the original 
problem causes a cascade of error events later on, and bypassing the eeprom check in 
this case didn't help you at all. Something is wrong in the driver, but I don't 
understand yet why it only affects one of the 3 nics in your system.

almost sounds like a bug got fixed and it introduced a regression. this wouldn't be the 
right time to pull out git-bisect would it? even loading 2.6.15, 2.6.16, 2.6.17 on it 
would give us some good information.
