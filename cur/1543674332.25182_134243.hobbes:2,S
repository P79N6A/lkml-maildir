Hello!
    There is a bit of strange code in fs/proc/proc_misc.c::cmdline_read_proc()
        int len;
        len = sprintf(page, "%s\n", saved_command_line);
        len = strlen(page);
    Why do we need the strlen() here? It looks like pure overhead to me.
    Am I missing something obvious?
Bye,
    Oleg
