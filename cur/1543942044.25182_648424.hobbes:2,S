	Looking at the kernel's patch I don't think so:
-void global_flush_tlb(void)
-{
-       struct list_head l;
-       struct page *pg, *next;
-
-       BUG_ON(irqs_disabled());
-
-       spin_lock_irq(&cpa_lock);
-       list_replace_init(&df_list, &l);
-       spin_unlock_irq(&cpa_lock);
-       flush_map(&l);
-       list_for_each_entry_safe(pg, next, &l, lru) {
-               list_del(&pg->lru);
-               clear_bit(PG_arch_1, &pg->flags);
-               if (PageReserved(pg) || !cpu_has_pse || page_private(pg) != 0)
-                       continue;
-               ClearPagePrivate(pg);
-               __free_page(pg);
-       }
-}
-
-EXPORT_SYMBOL(global_flush_tlb);
