Alexandre Ratchov and Laurent Vivier from BULL have been done some work 
in e2fsprog to support extents and 48/64 bit ext3, although the patches 
have not been thoroughly reviewed and discussed yet...

Yes, the extents patch you mentioned is the same one included in the 
series. The delalloc (support delayed allocation for ext3) and mballoc ( 
support multiple block allocation based on extents) are considered a 
future to add, as this series is intend to address the capability issue 
and on-disk format only.

Thanks for your interest!
We have tested patch 1-4 (which basically not touching any on-disk 
format) and they have been in mm tree. Extent patch itself have been 
tested for a long time by ClusterFS and IBM, as it's actually being 
posted a while back.
At this point the whole series pass compile, but not being tested yet. 
This post as a RFC is intend to collect comments and feedbacks. BULL 
team has done some test on the 2.6.16 version of the series with the 
e2fsprog changes they posted though. I will upload the matching 
e2fsprogs changes to ext2.sf.net/48bitsext3 shortly..
