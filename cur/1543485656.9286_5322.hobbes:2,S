Hello!
I just installed the 2.2.1 Kernel. I love the framebuffers so I won't 
downgrade. But:
I wanted to write a CD as I did with 2.0.36 some weeks ago. The program I 
used was "cdwrite" which uses the generic scsi devices to write.
I made cdwrite use /dev/sg3 being my cdwriter but when it started it used 
not the cdwriter but the harddisk containing my linux root filesystem !!!!
The action luckily failed without error (besides a strange syslog message 
I don't have here). The filesystem was not harmed but my partition table 
was destroyed, I had to recover it with some DOS program...
Anyway, I use an Adaptect 2940UW (AIC7880). Is it possible that the 
driver accessed the wrong drive ?
Can someone check this? Let me (by email) know how I can help to identify 
the guilty code...
