In one way, it doesn't make sense to "bk send" a CSET that is already
in the parent repository, so by default <url> should probably be the
parent.  The "proper" mode of operation would be to "bk pull" on the
other end if they want to get a copy of the whole repository, I think.
If you can't contact the repository to check, "bk send" would only send
a subset of CSETs unless told otherwise.  Maybe at most all CSETs generated
locally which do not have CSETs from the parent repository following them,
or maybe non-local CSETs following them.
Unfortunately, I don't know how hard it is to determine "CSETs from the
parent repository".  It is also hard to guess what to do when you _are_
the parent repository.
In general I don't think you ever want to send a whole repository by
email, and this is probably a user error.
Cheers, Andreas
