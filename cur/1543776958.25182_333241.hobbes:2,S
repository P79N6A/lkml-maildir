But they like the name "dtrace" instead?  (sorry, couldn't resist...)
Come on, they will never see the name "debugfs", right?  Your tools will
then have a common place to look for your ltt and other files, as you
_know_ where it will be mounted in the fs namespace.
And you _are_ doing kernel debugging and tracing with ltt, what's wrong
with admitting that?

Sorry, but debugfs was there first, and people are already using it in
the kernel tree :)
Anyway, good luck trying to get the distros to accept
yet-another-fs-to-mount-somewhere, I know it was hard to get support for
sysfs as it was...
