I merged the patchset (with 2 very minor fixups) but I think that this
one still needs some small preparatory changes first.
[ BTW I also merged outstanding ide patches.  Not many ide-{atapi,cd}
  changes in them though.  Thus if you prefer you may as well send me
  patches based on the old tree and let me handle potential rejects. ]

Yes, this change is OK but for bisectability reasons it would be better
to do it in pre-patch (which would fix ide-cd.c accordingly).
[ The other changes in functionality are small and acceptable for this
  patch (i.e. ide_wait_stat() prints error message now) except the change
  of the ordering between ->dma_start and ->output_data calls -- which
  also seems to deserve patch on its own. ]
Otherwise it all looks fine and Big Thanks for working on this!
