You mean you're still using 2k blocks? I use 4k blocks on filesystems
larger than 4G. Noticably faster mount times and fsck times. (ok, it
may be a bit less efficient, but larger than 4G means that i'm talking
about larger disks..... And I'm spending at least 400M in "reserved
for superuser", and chances are that I'm using less than 100k files on
such a filesystem, so the block-size roundoff is also going to be less
than 400M....)
