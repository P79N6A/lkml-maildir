You may have gotten it from "Advanced MSDOS Programming", but a lot of
non-x86 architectures do not have "MSDOS" partition tables, and
therefore don't contain these magic numbers.  In fact, these may
well be just a bunch of zeros on all the other partition types,
thereby shooting a rather large hole in an otherwise sound idea.

But then how do you locate the root partition on the disk if the
kernel does not know how to read the partition table on that disk?
This needs to be in the kernel, and again, it probably won't be a
MSDOS table for most non-x86 architectures.
