Oh... I read your response but thought that was only response to 'that 
wouldn't work' part.

I think Al Viro is on that now.

To certain extent, I do agree with you - it's safer/simpler..., but on 
the other hand, new brsem isn't that more complex and would perform 
almost identically without extra semantical baggage.  So, I thought it 
might be worth a bit more effort.
Hmm... So, array of rwsem's, it should be.
