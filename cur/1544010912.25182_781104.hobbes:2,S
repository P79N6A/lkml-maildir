In the beginning, the use of separate locks for reading and writing
would be sufficient. Then, there would be only one atomic comparison
needed to check, if the write pointer meets the read pointer. This
should be not as difficult since read and write is always in different
pages (if a am not wrong) and thus only the pointer to the pages have
to be compared.
