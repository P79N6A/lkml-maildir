I also see this with non rt tasks causing a burst of schedules.
1. Process A runs and grabs lock L. then finishes its time slice.
2. Process B runs and tries to grab Lock L.
3. Process A runs and releases lock L.
4. __up_mutex gives process B lock L.
5. Process A tries to grab lock L.
6. Process B runs and releases lock L.
7. __up_mutex gives lock L to process A.
8. Process B tries to grab lock L again.
9. Process A runs...
Here we have more unnecessary schedules.  So the condition to grab a lock
should be:
1. not owned.
2. partially owned, and the owner is not RT.
3. partially owned but the owner is RT and so is the grabber, and the
    grabber's priority is >= the owner's priority.
