But then bi_max is the _actual_ size of the BIO, and not the
size which the caller requested.
umm, err, actually, that suits me just fine ;)  We could leave
bi_size as-is and just implement
	unsigned bio_nr_bvecs(struct bio *bio);
But that may not work for privately allocated BIOs.  "bios not
coming from bio_alloc()"?
What _are_ these private BIOs, anyway?  Is any in-kernel code
constructing them at present?
