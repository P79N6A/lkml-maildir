It works with CONFIG_MODULES.

Because otherwise, for example, .data.percpu sections we already have
get picked up by *(.data.*), and then *(.data.percpu) end up empty:
                __per_cpu_start = .;
                       *(.data.percpu)
                       *(.data.percpu.shared_aligned)
                __per_cpu_end = .;
and all hell breaks loose.
We need to stop using sections named like
.text.xxxx
.data.xxxx
.rodata.xxxx
.bss.xxxx
