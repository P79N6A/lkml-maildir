Subject: [PATCH 0/4] improve alternative instruction code and optimize get_cycles_sync
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/28/85

This series of patches extend the alternative instructions framework on
i386 and x86_64 architectures to support two alternative instruction
replacements. This code is used together with the introduction of the
X86_FEATURE_SYNC_RDTSC flag on i386 to simplify and optimize the
get_cycles_sync() function. The optimization changes this function to
use RDTSCP instead of CPUID;RDTSC if this instruction is available.
Don't use CPUID there is really important if the kernel runs as a KVM
guest, because this instruction is intercepted and causes an expensive
VMEXIT.
