It already existed in Alexey's iputils (tracepath).

Raw options are passed. That ip_options ever appeared in glibc/user headers
was a bug, it is strictly kernel internal.

IP_PKTINFO does not allow to set source addresses, only destination
addresses. Source address depends on the boundage or the route.

POLLERR is returned until the error queue is empty. I suspect you're
not emptying it properly in all cases. It can contain multiple errors.
