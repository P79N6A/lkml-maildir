and note that this is really a "branch tracer/profiler", with branch 
taken/untaken prediction hits/misses. The likely()/unlikely() is an 
in-kernel tool to manually predict branch likelyhood - and for now we 
trace and profile those points that we tweaked manually - but there's 
no reason why that should be true for future versions too.
So i think it's generally better to think of these events as hit/miss 
events.
