Not really, is it? If so then wouldn't that be a bug.
I guess some code might hold a critical section open for longer than
it absolutely needs to, in order to gain efficiency, but basically
your're bound pretty well by critical section size.

It is determined by the amount of code that is not preemptible, rather
than the maximum amount of time between sucessive calls to cond_resched.
IMO the former is cleaner.

Yeah definitely. And in practice distos sometimes have to just go with
what works at the time. So it might be a fine solution for them indeed.

I guess it is a number of reasons. Probably the main one had
traditionally been the chance of bugs. I guess the next big one is
return on overhead (ie. the scheduling latency soon runs into the
problem of long critical sections), although thanks to you and
others, I understand that is becoming less and less of an issue over
time too.
If a new SUSE kernel branch was started from 2.6.12 with VP turned on
rather than PREEMPT then I would probably argue against it a little
bit ;)
