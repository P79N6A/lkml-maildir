The networking does not stop, I can ssh into and out of the box
without any problem.
When 'gnome-session' hangs, it does not react to any clicks on the
terminal or browser icons.  If I switch to a virtual console then come
back into X, the panels (or splash) are gray - the icons disappear. I
can switch to a virtual console and give it the three finger salute and
it reboots cleanly.
When 'big-copy' hangs, if I switch to a different console and run
'lsof', '[u]mount', or use shell completion on a network mount then that
process goes into D state.  I cannot umount the network shares nor
stop autofs.  I cannot do a clean reboot, I have to ssh
in and "echo s > /proc/sysrq-trigger; echo u > /proc/sysrq-trigger;
echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger" .
I am not mounting anything using CIFS, but I could give it a try.
I could transfer 75 GB without hiccup with 2.6.19 using NFS4 and CIFS,
and with 2.6.20 using CIFS.  2.6.20 works fine under reasonably light
load, with gnome sessions logging in and out several times a day.
