This is how DRM does it...
        for (i = 0; driver->pci_driver.id_table[i].vendor != 0; i++) {
                pid = (struct pci_device_id *)&driver->pci_driver.id_table[i];
                pdev = NULL;
                /* pass back in pdev to account for multiple identical cards */
                while ((pdev =
                        pci_get_subsys(pid->vendor, pid->device, pid->subvendor,

                        /* stealth mode requires a manual probe */
                        pci_dev_get(pdev);
