I think "package manager" is the best possible way to think about this 
problem.
I can't tell you how often I've wished the kernel config process behaved 
like apt and just prompted me with a list of things it would need to 
enable to allow me to use the option and ask me if I still want to do it. 
The reverse when I try and remove something important would be good too 
just ask me if I really want to remove all those as well.
A functional equivelant of deborphan would be cool too.  Just run it and 
have it tell me what is enabled that no devices depend on.
The config system is nasty even for power users. There is a fun part of 
the netfilter code where I find myself having to enable all from one menu, 
go to the next menu down enable everything and then go back to the first 
menu.
