Cool, but keep in mind that this is totally unsupported.  If this kernel 
breaks, you get to keep both pieces (though I'll try to help glue it back 
together!) :)

I think 'make help' documents most of it.

These messages are consistent with having a PROM that's too old; you need at 
least 3.32.  You'll have to dig around the support site some more or talk to 
your support person for that though.  Booting with 'nohalt' should work 
around this particular issue though.
