I think I actually do. I just haven't expressed myself well enough for

This is used to make intel look more like other architectures.

I always get confused with intel's terminology.  That's why I tried to
stay with the generic physical (what the bus sees) and the virtual (what
the CPU sees).

OK, I'm too lazy to go open up my Intel books (they're buried someplace,
and my online documention is too big), so I'm assuming that the CR3
register is the pointer to the Global Page Table (GPT).

Lets for sake of simplicity, forget about how the kernel fills up the
entries in the GPT (can be done from page faults).

OK, the CR3 (If I was right in my above statement) points to the page
tables. So we have
         GPT
CR3 -> +--------+
       |        | -> user page tables.
       |        |
       |        |
       |        |
       |0xc0000 | ->  Page table of kernel
       +--------+
      
If all the user's Global page tables (GPT) has a pointer to the kernel
page table for the address of 0xc0000000 and above, then there's no
problem in switching the CR3 register.  What happens is that the user's
page tables will change. But all the user tasks have the upper address
pointing to the same address (thus the kernel), with the proper
protection bits as described earlier that say that only when the CPU is
in kernel mode does it have access to this.
I hope this helps, since I'm just about to leave to Ottawa. (See
everyone there ;-)
