Hi,
I am trying to boot a 2.4.17 (i386) kernel with 64GB kernel config
and PAGE_OFFSET changed to 3.5 GB (0xE0000000) and it does not boot.
I was wondering why ? I have 8GB on my machine (P-III). I looked 
at Andrea's 3.5 GB user-virtual patch. It does not support 3.5GB 
for 64GB kernel either ? I can't boot even with forcing mem=1G either.
Is there something fundamental here ?
Please let me know.
Thanks,
Badari
