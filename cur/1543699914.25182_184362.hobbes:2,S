I have my suspicions about inter-zone balancing in 2.6.
Something seems wrong, but I can't quite put my finger
on it yet.  This should have quite some impact in the
1 - 4 GB range and a test (done by somebody else, I can't
give you the details yet unfortunately) has shown there
is a problem.
I'm working on it and should come up with a patch soon.
