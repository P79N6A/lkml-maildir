Well, there are two potential solutions:
a) stop rebuild until fsck is fixed
b) wait with fsck until rebuild is fixed
Both of them are valid. The first one is valid in a scenario where you want to
decrease downtimes in favor of insecure operation/or multiple redundancy
The second one is good if you prefer data consitency over small down times. It
might actually speed up the bootup process, one has to measure this.
