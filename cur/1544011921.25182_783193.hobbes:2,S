I dont think that's necessary - tick_dev_program_event() already includes 
a gradual approach that increases the 'min delta' interval step by step - 
so we should find the 'system is limping along' compromise pretty 
accurately.
A system can get "magically faster" later on (if we turn off tracing or 
other kernel features that impact the cost of the timer tick), and we 
might not need those safety measures anymore - but here the real solution 
will be to make the virtualizer faster. Taking milliseconds to process a 
timer tick (be that under tracing or not) is rather slow. So the kernel 
has applied the brakes and has printed a warning about it - we should do 
no more.

no - global or static scope variables are initialized to zero in C.

hm, that would be interesting to see - in theory the system should become 
stable after a few iterations of increasing min_delta. Frederic, is the 
system still workable if you try what Frans has suggested?
Also, there's min_delta doubling in tick_dev_program_event() itself too - 
that interacts with the irq-overload logic:
+       dev->min_delta_ns = (unsigned long)try_time.tv64 * 3;
