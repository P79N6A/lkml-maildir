Yes.

But how does this explain spa_no_frills setting promotion to max not having 
this problem?

Would it hurt to add it to spa_no_frills and let the children inherit it?

spa_ebs is great, but rather bursty.  Even setting max_ia_bonus=0 doesn't fix 
that.  Is there a way to smooth it like spa_no_frills?

Perhaps.

Actually, setting timeslice to 5,50,100 gives me better performance on 
kernbench.  After closer inspection, I found 120ms a rather awkward 
timeslice whereas 5,50, and 100 exhibited a smoother and faster response, 
which may be machine dependent, thus the need for an autotuner.
Thanks!
