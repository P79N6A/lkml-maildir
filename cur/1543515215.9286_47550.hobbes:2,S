Your memory tester turned up a fault in the memory. One of the bytes in
the memory has two bits permanently stuck at high. This is only two bits
out of all the bytes I have.
Your memory program did the trick, now I wonder if the memory test
routines could be used by the kernel to map out bad memory, at least
temporarily until I replace the memory (perhaps as a unmappable 4k page?)
This could increase Linux's capability to deal with bad memory
successfully. 
Cheers,
