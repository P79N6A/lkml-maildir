I am *very* wary of this idea.  A year or two ago there was a big hole
in the BSD's because you could do:
        i = open("foo", 0)
without any access to "foo" and get a filedescriptor without read or
write access.  The problem is that many devices will implicitly allow
any ioctl() done to them (on the theory that you must have had permission
to open the device).  You're potentially opening the same sorts of
bugs in linux.
Second, file descriptors are currently analagous to capabilities (the
academic use of the word, *not* the linux use of the word) in that they
are indications of security that can be passed among processes with
differing credentials (either across a set[ug]id execve or by passing
them across a socket)  Allowing any process to get a filedescriptor
without needing read or write permission undermines these basic
semantics.
In short, you are playing with fire for an extraordinarily small gain
(replacing a few small syscalls with slower libc versions)  This is
not a good idea.
