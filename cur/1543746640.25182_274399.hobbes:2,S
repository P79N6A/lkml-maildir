Subject: [patch][trivial] avoid signed/unsigned comparison in drivers/eisa/eisa-bus.c::eisa_name_device()

This is trivial and of questional importance, but I'll submit it 
none-the-less - feel free to drop/ignore.
The patch changes the 'i' variable in eisa_name_device() to be unsigned 
for no other reason than to avoid this warning when building with gcc -W :
drivers/eisa/eisa-bus.c: In function `eisa_name_device':
drivers/eisa/eisa-bus.c:62: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
whether this variable is a signed or unsigned int will not make any actual 
difference, but I thought it would be nice to have one less warning to go 
through when building with -W - especially when it won't do any harm nor 
obfuscate the code to make the change (and you could argue that since we 
are looping through a table that cannot have any negative indices, the 
index 'i' is logically unsigned).
