Subject: [2.6.20.16 review 09/28] sparsemem: fix oops in x86_64 show_mem

We aren't sampling for holes in memory. Thus we encounter a section hole with
empty section map pointer for SPARSEMEM and OOPs for show_mem. This issue
has been seen in 2.6.21, current git and current mm. This patch is for
2.6.21 stable. It was tested against sparsemem.
Previous to commit f0a5a58aa812b31fd9f197c4ba48245942364eae memory_present
was called for node_start_pfn to node_end_pfn. This would cover the hole(s)
with reserved pages and valid sections. Most SPARSEMEM supported arches
do a pfn_valid check in show_mem before computing the page structure address.
This issue was brought to my attention on IRC by Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo at
acme@redhat.com. Thanks to Arnaldo for testing.
