Looking at the patch, it builds tables that can refer to .init.text but
then it excludes table entries that do not fall between _text and
_etext.  Which makes the reference from .smp_locks to .init.text a
false positive.  Gerd, is that the way that smp_alternatives is meant
to work?  If so, I will update reference_*.pl.

+					    __smp_locks, __smp_locks_end,
+					    _text, _etext);
