Why?  The kernel wouldn't boot on i386 anyway, as it would be too
large.

Just don't compile it in.

I'm sure a patch to fix it would be accepted.

Some people might be interested in it.  Maybe somebody would like to
fix it, but can't buy the physical hardware for any price.  Maybe
everybody who has the hardware can't fix it because other kernel bugs
prevent them from using the latest kernels on their machines.  Why
remove it when it's doing no harm whatsoever?
John.
