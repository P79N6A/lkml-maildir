I'm also not against such approaches.
As I worked for QNX I liked to provoke my Canadian coworkers
with arguments like: RTLinux is able to swap - not bad for a hack ;-)

When talking about hard realtime it's all about worst case
considerations. Average does not count (then you are talking about
*soft realtime* -> like multimedia apps, where only the quality counts).
So you could only tell how long your compile lasts at *maximum*
As I said before: the OS is only the foundation for realtime *systems*

Yes, given that vxworks is more like a realtime executive
(but this seems to change: only true when running without VxVMI? )
