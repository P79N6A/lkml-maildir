Nope:
+static long do_splice_to(struct file *in, struct inode *pipe, size_t len,
+			 unsigned long flags)
+{
+	if (in->f_op && in->f_op->splice_read) {

+		left = isize - in->f_pos;
It's doing
		32bit = 64bit - 64bit;

OK.  In some ways I agree with Nick that a pwrite/pread-like interface is
nicer, so things are more stateless and threads don't have to fight over
f_pos.  Dunno..

That would seem appropriate.
btw, that function might have a problem I think - it returns NULL with
the page locked, but pipe_to_sendpage() and other callers don't appear to
unlock it.

find_get_pages() does "find me the next N pages above `index' which are
presently in pagecache'.  So it can return an array of page*'s which do not
represent contiguous pages in the file - there can be holes in there.
IOW: pages[n]->index !necessarily= pages[n+1]->index-1
Maybe the code handles that by making sure that all the pages in the range
are already in pagecache - I didn't check.  But that would take some heroic
locking.

OK.  ("cold" is a wild-ass guess as to whether you think those pages'
contents are likely to be be in CPU cache.  I'd guess "yes", so cold=0).
