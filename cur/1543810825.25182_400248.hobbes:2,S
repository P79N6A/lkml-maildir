yes the reason for making this optional is clear, and Christoph also
understands that.
However the idea that Christoph is proposing is to not make it a compile
time option, but a runtime option. Compile-time is not very flexible,
especially not for linux distributions. Making it a module option means
it becomes runtime behavior, and the user can load the module like
modprobe aerca msi=0
and msi gets turned off. No need to recompile anything! That has many
advantages over a more inflexible (from the user view) compiletime-only
option.
