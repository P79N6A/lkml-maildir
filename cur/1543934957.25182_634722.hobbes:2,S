Yes both look wrong.
Patrick, please have a look at the former.  In fact it's not just
that ihl may be bogus (which might be harmless as long as the REJECT
hook only gets called from within the IP stack), I think REJECT would
also do the wrong thing if the packet had IP options.  So perhaps we
should just make it create a packet from scratch rather than being
too clever in reusing the old one.
As to LRO, I must say it was a pretty shoddy job.  Now I can't complain
too much because I wasn't able to spend any time in 2007 working on it.
But it's definitely high on my todo list for 2008.
Oh and Al, your effort in going through all the ip_fast_csum callers
is much appreciated!
Thanks,
