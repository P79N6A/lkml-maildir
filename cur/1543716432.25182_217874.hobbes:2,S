current status is simple, there are patches for
kernel 2.4 and 2.6 available, maybe a little outdated
but that should not be too hard to fix, if there is
some interest (so let me know ;).
I started to prepare those patches for inclusion
in mainline, but the first patch (atime) still has
not been included so I delayed the other patches,
because I do not want to walk an empty mile ...
best,
Herbert
