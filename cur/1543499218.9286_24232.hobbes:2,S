Use large block sizes then.  It makes a huge difference.

They are close to the data, though.  Placing indirect information in a
separate cluster of blocks may make it easier to do metadata-only
operations like fsck and unlink, but it will just slow down things which
actually access data too.  That seems like a crazy thing to want to do!
