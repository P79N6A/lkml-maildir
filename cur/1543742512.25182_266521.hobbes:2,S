Looking at just doing this for the semaphore code, I hit on the fact that
we already do this for the rwsem's.. So changing just the regular
semaphore code to use "fastcall" should fix this particular bug, but I'm
still interested in hearing whether somebody has a patch for the system
calls and faults too?
