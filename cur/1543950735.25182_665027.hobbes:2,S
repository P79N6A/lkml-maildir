No - this lookup was there before to get struct kobject from the dev_t, 
I just make it look up in another map.

_No_new_hooks_ - just the map is get from task, not from a static variable.
I have basically three objections against LSM.
1. LSM is not stackable, so loading this tiny module with devices
   access rights will block other security modules;
2. Turning CONFIG_SECURITY on immediately causes all the other hooks
   to get called. This affects performance on critical paths, like
   process creation/destruction, network flow and so on. This impact
   is small, but noticeable;
3. With LSM turned on we'll have to "virtualize" it, i.e. make its
   work safe in a container. I don't presume to judge how much work
   will have to be done in this area, so the result patch would be
   even larger and maybe will duplicate functionality, which is currently
   in cgroups. OTOH, cgroups already provide the ways to correctly 
   delegate proper rights to containers.

Hardly - the largest part of my patch is cgroup manipulations. The part
that makes the char and block layers switch to new map ac check the 
permissions is 10-20 lines of new code.
But with LSM I will still need this API.
