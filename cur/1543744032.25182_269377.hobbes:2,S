This (first alternative) sounds related to the problem I had with DVB;
I got visible corruption of video memory when using xawtv on the DVB
video device using Xv on a G550. The cause might lie in either of:
- Hardware/AV7110 firmware
- Kernel DVB driver (probably: AV7110 videodevice part), tried many versions
- Xfree86 XV-over-videodevice driver, tried several versions
- Xfree86 MGA driver, tried several versions
Never found the cause, but the problem went away with disabling the Xv
extension (now using video overlay mode).
