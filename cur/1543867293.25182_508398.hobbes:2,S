Your vendor should be able to tell you whether the library versions you
have are sufficiently up to date, which apps need restarting and which
apps use their own timezone code and problems (check for example if you
use Java)
It's nothing special, timezone rules change all the time. Be glad the
world is mostly standardising. When I was younger the UK summer time
switches were set in a meeting each year and they were not too worried
about adjusting it a week for Royal Ascot and that kind of thing.
