Dear All,
Thanks for all your help with this problem, I've just got it sorted with
your amazingly quick responses.
In case anybody comes across this problem in the future, here's a summary:
From: 
http://developer.intel.com/design/PentiumII/prodbref/
    PII-350, 400 and 450 all support memory cacheability for up to 4GB of
    addressable memory space. They don't mention what the PII-333 and
    below support.
cat /proc/mtrr returns:
    reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1
    Thanks to Ingo Molnar for pointing me in this direction
To delete the current MTRR, from: /usr/src/linux/Documentation/mtrr.txt
    echo "delete=0" > /proc/mtrr
To install the new MTRR:
    echo "base=0x00000000 size=0x40000000 type=write-back" > /proc/mtrr
    Thanks to Ingo again...
cat /proc/mtrr now returns:
    reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
and updatedb now takes 15.1 seconds (down from 12 minutes)!
Thanks again,
Corin Hartland-Swann
