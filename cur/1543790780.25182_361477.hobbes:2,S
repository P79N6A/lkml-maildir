The strace is a little big (1.5GB), but sure, people can have it if they're
interested. OTOH, I just noticed that syslogd shows:
  Oct 30 09:55:50 cirkus named[13364]: errno2result.c:109: unexpected error:
  Oct 30 09:55:50 cirkus named[13364]: unable to convert errno to isc_result: 14: Bad address
  Oct 30 09:55:50 cirkus named[13364]: UDP client handler shutting down due to fatal receive error: unexpected error
...and after that, everything seems to crash and burn. The related strace
call is:
  [pid 13365] recvmsg(22, 0x561329b0, 0)  = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
Might this be a BIND bug instead? In that case, why doesn't it show up with
2.6.11.9? I've restarted BIND now without NPTL, to see if it might be
thread-related.

We're not going to change DNS server software anytime soon on our production
servers, but thanks for the tip :-)
