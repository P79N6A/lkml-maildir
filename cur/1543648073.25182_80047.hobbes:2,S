Hello
Are there modem drivers available for an AMD PCNet adapter, chip AM79C978XC, 
or is this even the right place to ask?
This card has both ethernet and modem ports, and works with the windoze 
drivers.
I saw some discussion about an AM79C973 in the archives, but that was an 
ethernet card.
Many Thanks
Pi
