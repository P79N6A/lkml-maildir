We have one complete dependency graph for the explicit dependencies.
What is slow is extracting the implicit dependencies after an object
has been compiled, i.e. the files that it includes.  Actually
extracting the implicit dependencies is fast, converting them to
standard names is fast, what is slow is _reading_ the big list that
maps from absolute names to standardized names.
I need the big list in order to remove absolute names in the dependency
trees.  kbuild 2.4 forces a complete recompile if you rename a tree,
including if you build on one system then try to install via NFS on a
second system.  kbuild 2.5 can cope with trees being renamed and trees
having different names on local and NFS mounted systems.  That
flexibility comes at a cost.
"All" I need to do is have one server process that reads the big list
once and the other client processes talk to the server.  Much less data
involved means faster conversion from absolute to standardized names.
