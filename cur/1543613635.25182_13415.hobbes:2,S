"Design wise" is highly overrated.
Simplicity is _much_ more important, if something commonly is only done a
few hundred times a second. Locking overhead is basically zero for that
case.

Maybe. But read the rest of the sentence. There are issues that are about
a million times more important.

4 cpu's are "high end" today. We can probably point to tens of thousands
of UP machines for each 4-way out there. The ratio gets even worse for 8,
and 16 CPU's is basically a rounding error.
You have to prioritize. Scheduling overhead is way down the list.
