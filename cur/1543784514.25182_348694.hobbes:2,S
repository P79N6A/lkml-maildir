What's this for, then? (arch/i386/kernel/traps.c line 116)
static inline unsigned long print_context_stack(struct thread_info *tinfo,
                                unsigned long *stack, unsigned long ebp)
{
        unsigned long addr;
#ifdef  CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER
        while (valid_stack_ptr(tinfo, (void *)ebp)) {
                addr = *(unsigned long *)(ebp + 4);
                printk(" [<%08lx>] ", addr);
                print_symbol("%s", addr);
                printk("\n");
                ebp = *(unsigned long *)ebp;
        }
#else
I get nice clean stack traces on i386 with frame pointers enabled and
the kernel is smaller as well.
