This is what I've decided on doing:
I'm having a framework for multiple drivers (probe and set methods,
basically); the stock distro will have VGA and VESA drivers only.
Dropping new drivers in is trivial if someone wants to.  I was going to
leave in the CL54xx and ATI drivers since I actually have specimens of
those, except it appears that on current specimens of those cards, the
probe succeeds but the mode-setting fails, so I dropped those as well.
If someone happens to have algorithms for setting 132-character mode on
especially the CL54xx series with raw register writes I'd actually be
interested, since that's what Bochs and Qemu emulate, and on those it
would be really nice to have a larger text mode.
