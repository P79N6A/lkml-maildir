Well coolio.  Would somebody be up for sanity checking my audio mmap
code (attached)?  It doesn't look too hard at all to get the audio
drivers doing the correct thing.
Converting to this was easy...  my driver hardcodes the buffer size at
PAGE_SIZE.  Since Via audio uses scatter-gather DMA, all I need to do in
'nopage' is get the virtual page number for the vma, and use that as a
direct index into the scatter-gather array.
Since this code works in my local tests, my two concerns at this point
are correct vma->vm_pgoff treatment, and correct vm_flags/vm_file usage.
