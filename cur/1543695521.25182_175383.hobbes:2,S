Hi,
When a process mmaps a file, how does the kernel know the memory has been
written to (and hence the page is dirty)? Is this done by setting the
protected flag, and when the memory is first written to it's set to dirty?
What function is responsible for this setting? And when will the page be
written back to disk (i.e. where's the flusher located)?
Thanks for any help,
Amir.
