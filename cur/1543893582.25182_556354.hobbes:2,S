Nice results. Thanks for taking the time to post them!

I'm pleased you think the rest of my patches may help there but only the SD 
patches affect scheduling unless you set a different scheduling policy or 
there is a vm issue.
List:
ck2-version.patch
2.6.21-sd-0.48.patch
sched-sd-0.48-interactive_tunable.patch
sched-range.patch
sched-iso-5.4.patch
track_mutexes-1.patch
sched-idleprio-2.3.patch
sched-limit_policy_changes.patch
sched-ck-add-above-background-load-function.patch
cfq-ioprio_inherit_rt_class.patch
cfq-iso_idleprio_ionice.patch
mm-swap_prefetch-35.patch 
mm-convert_swappiness_to_mapped.patch 
mm-lots_watermark.diff
mm-kswapd_inherit_prio-1.patch 
mm-prio_dependant_scan-2.patch
mm-background_scan-2.patch
mm-filesize_dependant_lru_cache_add.patch
mm-idleprio_prio.patch
kconfig-expose_vmsplit_option.patch
hz-default_1000.patch 
hz-no_default_250.patch 
hz-raise_max-2.patch
ck-desktop-tune.patch
mm-swap-prefetch-35-38.patch
apart from ck-desktop-tune.patch which is in total this:
-int rr_interval __read_mostly = 8;
+int rr_interval __read_mostly = 6;
which is already a tunable that's part of SD.
So unless there's a vm issue (which does not appear to be the case) I can't 
see how any of these will change Tobias' extensive testing results.
Thanks.
