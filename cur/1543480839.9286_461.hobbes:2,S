Uh-oh. It seems we have some problem here. There are two different K6-2:
model 8 /[7:0] and model 8 /[F:8].
One should deal with write allocate on these models in completely different
ways.
It seems there are no differences in /proc/cpuinfo for /[7:0] and /[F:8].
Correct me if I'm wrong. I have just K6 (not -2), so I don't know exactly.
Well, I could add some additional cpuid-like activity to kernel, but I
should know before: is it superfluous? Maybe it's already done?

This is a message. Or something silly like that.
