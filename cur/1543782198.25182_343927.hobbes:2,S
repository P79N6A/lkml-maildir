Hi Andrew.  The following 3 patches update the i386 and x86_64 hugetlb
arch code to bring it closer to the other architectures.  The first
patch adds a pte_huge() macro.  The second patch moves the "stale pte"
check into huge_pte_alloc() which seems more appropriate to me.  The
third patch checks for p?d_present() for each step in huge_pte_offset().
Barring any new objections, could we take these for a spin in -mm?
