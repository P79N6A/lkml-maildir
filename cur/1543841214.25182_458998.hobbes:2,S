What about portable access to the PCI DMA API from userspace? I didn't
think we had a way to handle DMA buffer management entirely from
userspace. Looking at this code, it seems focused on one particular
problem space of industrial control. If the goal is to allow most
PCI drivers to be implemented in user space then I think it makes further
sense to not limit the subsystem to PCI but any device (like things that
are implemented as platform devices in kernel space).

Well, if it's focused on industrial controls like it appears from
the code here then the name is fine. If it's a starting point to
become someting more generic then User Space Driver (USD) subsystem
might be nice.
A more generic system would go a long way to get rid of the dubious
secret-sauce binary kernel modules that are popular in embedded
linux projects.

That would be nice to see. I can't see how devices and drivers
are registered from user space with what's here. I see
iio_register_device() exported but no clue how userspace tells
the kernel to claim a device or register an iio driver.
