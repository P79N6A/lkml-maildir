We'll see just how quickly somebody steps up to the plate. I spent some
time taking the original Gladman source into gas format, and have a really
ugly (untested) direct conversion if somebody wants to work on it.
Side note: Jari Ruusu has himself been distributing the code he now 
objects to as part of his own linux kernel loop-aes patches. From the 
loop-aes README:
	Copyright 2001,2002,2003,2004 by Jari Ruusu.
	Redistribution of this file is permitted under the GNU Public License.
But the original x86 assembler code that is part of that loop-aes patch
was copyright Dr Brian Gladman, and was NOT originally under the GPL, so
it was Jari Ruusu who originally did something very suspect from a
copyright angle. Now he claims he never wanted to GPL it, but the fact is,
he's been distributing kernel patches with the code for a long time, and
claiming it is GPL'd.
So then David and James wanted to include it into the kernel as part of
the standard encryption layer, and I said no, since I felt the copyright
wasn't clear. So James asked Dr Gladman for permission to dual-license
under the GPL, and got it. So I was happy.
Now Jari Ruusu comes along and starts complaining about things. 
Jari: mitä helvetin järkeä tuossa on? Selitä.
