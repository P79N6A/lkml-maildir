Not true.  It has parallel ISA interrupts _and_ parallel PCI interrupts.
It's a TI 1250.  Unfortunately, the 1250 data sheet isn't available,
however there seems to be some consistency in the device codes to
features offered.
The 1450 and 1251A (both of which seem similar to 1250) has separate pins
for PCI parallel interrupts which are outside the control of the "IRQMUX"
register.  When these pins are not used for parallel PCI interrupts,
they function as "GPIO3" and "IRQSER" (for PCI serial interrupts)
respectively.  The function of these pins is controlled by the device
control register.
Please note that "IRQMUX" is a misleading definition of the register in
question.  The register programs various multifunction pins on the device
which _may_ be IRQ outputs, LED outputs, ZV switching outputs, audio, or
even GPIO.
