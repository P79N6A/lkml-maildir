As far as the naming of devices is concerned, the bug and the necessary
fix are entirely obvious.
But the interaction with userspace processes opening /dev/fwX while the
respective node is being shut down gave me headaches.  I am still not
entirely sure if I got it right in the patch update, i.e. if it is free
from deadlocks.  fw_device_shutdown() and fw_device_op_open() can be
entered at the same time.  Would device_unregister() have to acquire a
driver core lock which open() already took?  If yes, device_unregister()
would be blocked on this lock while fw_device_op_open() is blocked on
idr_rwsem.
So why did I move device_unregister() into the idr_rwsem protected
section in the first place?  That's because I wanted to guarantee that
fw_device_op_open() wouldn't look up a fw_device which is just in the
process of being unregistered.  But maybe we don't even need this guarantee.
It would all be so easy if I knew how the driver core works.  :-/
