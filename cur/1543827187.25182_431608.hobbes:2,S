Most tools that read an ext2/3 filesystem directly use the libext2fs
library, and it will definitely be the case that for files smaller
than 4TB, even on a filesystem with extents enabled, as long as you
are using a version of libext2fs which is extents-aware, it will work
without any changes.
For files larger than 4TB, we will need some kind of LFS-like
interface change (i.e., ext2fs_file_llseek64 vs. ext2fs_file_llseek),
but that should be the only change needed by the tool.
