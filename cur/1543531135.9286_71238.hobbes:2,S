   It does not such thing. It kills Joe User's emacs session without
providing a clue as to why emacs suddenly died. Joe User's will have lost
his work for no good reason.

   Disabling overcommit means that Joe User's emacs session won't be
killed. He may not even notice that the system ran low on memory.
Certainly, if Joe wasn't using his emacs session at the time, there's no
reason at all he should notice. That's part of controlability and
repeatability.
