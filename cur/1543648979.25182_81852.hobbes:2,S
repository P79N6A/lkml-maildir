As someone who reads this list via Gmane, I couldn't agree more!
One other thing for IBM folk who are forced to use Lotus Notes:
Please, Please, Please set up Notes to post RFC 2822 compiant messages when 
posting patches!  Otherwise, the default Notes settings will litter these 
messages (and smoetimes the text attachments) will all sorts of non-RFC 
compliant MIME crap.  Some mailers are able to cope with this, but many 
aren't.  If you don't believe me, check out some of the posts in the 
Archives (note the "=3D" for CR\LF's).  My thanks, however, for those IBM 
folk who have already compensated for this.
Cheers,
Nicholas
