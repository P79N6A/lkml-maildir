My remark was meant as a note "this sentence can't handle all 
regressions" (and for a user it doesn't matter whether a new 
regression is introduced or an old regression exposed).
It could be we simply agree on this one.  ;-)

And this is something I want to emphasize again.
How can we make any progress with the real problem and not only the 
symptoms?
There's now much money in the Linux market, and the kernel quality 
problems might result in real costs in the support of companies like
IBM, SGI, Redhat or Novell (plus it harms the Linux image which might 
result in lower revenues).
If [1] this is true, it might even pay pay off for them to each assign 
X man hours per month of experienced kernel developers to upstream 
kernel bug handling?
This is just a wild thought and it might be nonsense - better 
suggestions for solving our quality problems would be highly welcome...
