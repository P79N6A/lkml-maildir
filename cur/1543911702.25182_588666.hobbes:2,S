Sorry to keep replying to my own post, but further investigation
suggests that the memory losses may be occurring at times of heavy
filesystem access. The machines in question run rsyncs of hundreds of
thousands of files every few hours, and I'm starting to think that the
memory loss occurs during these times. I don't know how I'd go about
proving this though...
