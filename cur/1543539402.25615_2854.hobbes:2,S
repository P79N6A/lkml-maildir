Subject: isofs readdir boundarie and move sector error

We have found a problem with readdir() for isofs.  When there are a lot of files in a single directory, and when you copy that directory, some of the files can disappear.  For example, we found this with the Windows 2000 CD-ROM.
After looking into it, it seems that there is a boundary error in linux/fs/isofs/dir.c.  When the sector size is 2048 and the directory entry offset is also 2048, there is a problem.
When de_len, the sum of the buffer start address plus the offset becomes 2048 and *de_len is zero, then it skips one sector and you there fore skip some files.
Please look at the patch I have included for details.
