Same here.  I even unloaded the 3c509 module and it still did the same
thing.  Turns out it was 2.2.10 not 13 (driver the same?)
Something else of interest, another machine which was really on 2.2.13
rebooted for no reason (uptime 132 days).  Noone could have cracked the box
(noone here is that good and I had a monitor watching logs.)
