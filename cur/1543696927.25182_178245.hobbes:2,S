dd if=/dev/sda1|md5sum <--note use of the same device as to read pix.
has been running for 3 or so minutes now, steadily reading the camera.  
I shoulda put a time in front of it!  Ok got it, heres the sum:
127945+0 records in
127945+0 records out
f6c568dd1f35bb37f3d667a2ab228e2f
its a 64 meg card.  I'll have to unplug the camera (and cycle its 
power too) as all this is compiled into the kernel.
Ok, repeat run, with time this time:
Mmm, didn't get the md5sum, just the time, which was 
real    2m39.807s
user    0m1.052s
sys     0m1.984s
So I'll do another run, without the reset and without the time:
[root@coyote root]# dd if=/dev/sda1 | md5sum
127945+0 records in
127945+0 records out
f6c568dd1f35bb37f3d667a2ab228e2f
so the sums are the same, one more repeat, this time from powerdown 
reset and unplugged.
Purrfect repeat of the above.  Now lets see if /dev/sda will read 
it...  Yes it does.  Am I to understand that the non-numbered version 
of the device is the raw read from LSN0 of the device?
Ahh, that of course gets a different sum, and number of records read:
This is without the reset:
[root@coyote root]# dd if=/dev/sda | md5sum
128000+0 records in
128000+0 records out
b074ba314ac23f234b6d27da78e1e093
reset and restart, replug etc and again:
[root@coyote root]# dd if=/dev/sda | md5sum
128000+0 records in
128000+0 records out
b074ba314ac23f234b6d27da78e1e093
Looks like another flawless repeat here, and I'm probably making a 
serious dent in the batteries by now, that thing is positively 
ravenous when it comes to eating batteries.
What does this tell us?
