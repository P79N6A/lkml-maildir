Not a chance.  The only way we make it to that inode is through block
device I/O so it lives at exactly the same level in the hierarchy as
a real block device.  My patch is the considered rewrite boiled down
to it's essentials and made a trivial patch.
It fundamentally fixes the problem, and doesn't attempt to reconcile
the incompatible expectations of the ramdisk code and the buffer cache.

Well is more like saving 100 lines.  Not having to reexamine complicated
infrastructure code and doing things the same way ramfs is.  I think
that combination is a good reason.  Especially since I can do with a
16 line patch as I just demonstrated.  It is a solid and simple
incremental change.
