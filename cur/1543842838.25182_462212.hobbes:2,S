Power management was completely switched off, so that was not the cause.
Instead, please have a look the this dmesg outputs:
not working (no ACPI):
ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
unknown bus type 32. (repeated MULTIPLE TIMES!)
..TIMER: vector=0x31 apic1=-1 pin1=-1 apic2=-1 pin2=-1
...trying to set up timer (IRQ0) through the 8259A ...  failed.
...trying to set up timer as Virtual Wire IRQ... works.
working (ACPI + processor support):
ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
..TIMER: vector=0x31 apic1=0 pin1=2 apic2=-1 pin2=-1
Can this be considered as a kernel-bug?
Thanks for the help,
M.
