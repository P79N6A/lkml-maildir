Right...
And all the times you actually need to alter those values? 
Wouldn't it be better to document it in the first place, so 
one could _plan_ the system setup?
Example:
Setting up a firewall with four interfaces on a network 
with some <= 40 concurrent users with linux 2.2, ipchains, 
and masquerading. Firewall's hardware is intel p75 with 48MB 
ram. In high-traffic situations, the firewall starts 
dropping packets excessively.
After some thoughts about this, I dig into the kernel 
documentation. After increasing 
/proc/sys/net/core/netdev_max_backlog to 1500, hoping this 
could be equalient to MAXIMUM PACKET RECEIVE BUFFERS in 
netware, the problem is reduced dramatically.
I am really looking for what the /proc/sys is in detail. It 
is _not_ well documented anywhere, and if Linux should be 
able to compare with the big boys, there should be as few 
'secrets' left for the kernel hackers.
Please CC: answers to me as I'm not on the list

Roy
