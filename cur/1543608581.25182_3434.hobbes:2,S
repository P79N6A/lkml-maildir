It's the first time, I've tried this patch and I must say, that
the first impression is very good indeed.
I took a real world directory (my linux-kernel MH folder containing
roughly 115000 files) and did a 'du -s' on it.
Without the patch it took a little more than 20 minutes to complete.
With the patch, it took less than 20 seconds. (And that was inside uml)
However, when I accidentally killed the uml, it left me with an unclean
filesystem which fsck refuses to touch because it has unsupported features.
Even the latest version does this.
Is there a patch for fsck, that fixes this somewhere?
