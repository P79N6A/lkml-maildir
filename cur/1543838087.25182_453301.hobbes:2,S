It was changed by appended commit.
I do not see why the if/endif was removed - Paolo?

    [PATCH] Kbuild menu - hide empty NETDEVICES menu when NET is disabled
    Make the whole netdevices menu depend on NET, rather than having an empty
    submenu when networking is disabled.
    Indeed, almost the whole body of the menu was surrounded by if NETDEVICES,
    and what was outside depended on NETCONSOLE which is inside the menu.
