Scrolling and screen clearing. If the machine is loaded the screen may
not clear all of the way.
I have the following enabled:
CONFIG_FB_ATY=y
CONFIG_FB_ATY_CT=y
I get this on starup:
atyfb: using auxiliary register aperture
atyfb: 3D RAGE IIC (AGP) [0x475a rev 0x7a] 8M SDRAM, 14.31818 MHz XTAL, 230 MHz
If you need me to try anything just ask.
