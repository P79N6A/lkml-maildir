For what it's worth, I recently built an adapted LFS SVN for x86-64, using 
HJL's binutils 2.16.90.0.2. A few weeks later, and still no problems. 
Literally the only package I had difficulty building was Linux itself, and 
the attached patches seem to work fine.
Let's hope they get into mainline shortly.
