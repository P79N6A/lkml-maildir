Deliberately linking to the wrong symbol is not a point.  Might as well
replace file a.c with "int array = 0;".  That'll also bite the dust.  So?

In this context we were talking *function calls*, not confusing the
linker.  And whether you say "char array[];" or "char *const array;",
array is a pointer.  Even more so at the ABI = function call interface.
Another try:  Assume that
	#include "secret.h"
	int main() { printf("array = %s\n", array); return 0; }
is correct code.
Is the variable array a pointer to a char or an array of chars?
Oh well, who cares.
