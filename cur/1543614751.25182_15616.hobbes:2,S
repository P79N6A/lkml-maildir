1) "#ifdef CONFIG_FOO #include ..." is usually wrong and a bug.  But
that is a tangent and I digress.
2) Such changes can be expressed without regenerating all dependencies.

Your system is known broken because it is 100% slower.
My kernel builds work just fine now, your changes gain me nothing,
while COSTING me productivity.  I see no gains, only costs, with your
kbuild-2.5 system as it exists.
Keith the target audience is Linus and Alan and ME etc.  We are the
kernel hackers that perform kernel -development-.  Making end-user
builds easier is NOT a primary nor secondary nor tertiary goal here.
Make my life easier first.  Fuck Aunt Tillie.  Aunt Tillie can get
her kernels from a vendor.
