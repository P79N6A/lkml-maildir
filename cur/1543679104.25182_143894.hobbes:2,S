That's OK.  It is a matter of people being aware that the updates will be
echoed to a mailing list and acting appropriately.
If some low-value stuff leaks through then ho-hum, at least it was
on-topic.  It is not as if we are unused to low-value content...
It would be good if pure administrata such as changing the status were
filtered.
In fact, there is probably no point in sending anything bugzilla->list apart
from the initial report.  If the bug is then pursued via bugzilla then OK. 
If is is pursued via email then bugzilla just captures the discussion.

I think sending the initial report to the relevant lists and then capturing
incoming email would suffice.

Well hopefully people will have the sense to cut the bugzilla address off
the Cc line if it drifts off-topic.

Nah.  Just log everything and hack off the crap by larting people.
