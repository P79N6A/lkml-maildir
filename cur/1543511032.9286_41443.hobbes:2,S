Summary     : Red Hat utilities for probing and diagnosing system hardware.
Description :
The rhs-hwdiag package contains the Red Hat Hardware Discovery
Tools.  These tools probe the serial and parallel ports on your
system, and are useful for finding and reporting hardware errors
to Red Hat support if you're having problems.  These tools could
cause adverse side-effects in some situations, so you should use
them carefully.
though it's not very comprehensive.
ISTR that someone from SGI was writing an "hinv" for Linux.
