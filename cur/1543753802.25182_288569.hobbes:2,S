ok, you are right, and this would be fine with me. Wanna take a shot at
it? I've uploaded the -03 patch which is my most current tree. (with the
do_timer() moving done already.) I've reviewed the TSC offset codepath
again and i'm not sure where i got the 10 usecs from ... it's a pretty
cheap codepath that can be done in the direct interrupt just fine.
