No, quite the opposite. The board code knows its set of hardware
interfaces etc. and can let Ethernet driver use, say, HSS queues.
The driver can't know that.
It would make sense if we had many queues, but it doesn't seem
the case (perhaps the upper queues could be used for some
purposes, but Intel's code doesn't use them either and they
probably know better).

Without them the code in question is hardly readable, I pick the need
to remember about non-atomicity and possible side effects instead :-)
I've outlined the current versions in a separate mail, generally
2 patches are marked "v.2" and one "v.3".
