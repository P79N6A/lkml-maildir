If you are talking about a soft link named "linux", just completely
delete it and reset it to the value that it had when you installed
your distribution and then never touch it again.

Instead of "cp -Rr" to copy the directory, use "cp -a".  There is
a symlink in your source directory and "cp -Rr" is de-referencing it,
whereas "cp -a" properly preserves it.
Hope this helps,
Michael
