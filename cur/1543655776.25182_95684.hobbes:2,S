No, that's normal. Of course, you should have used Pauline's
bigphysarea patch, but otherwise it's a sane idea, IMHO.

I often wonder why MPEG hardware designers are such dorks.
It is pretty common place between them to ask for contiguous
memory. I would say, 95% of requests for contiguous memory
comes from poor hacks who have to deal with DVRs, PVRs,
and such. Practically no other hardware is this idiotic.
Not that it's impossible to do right, or anything. I think,
stradis is sane.
