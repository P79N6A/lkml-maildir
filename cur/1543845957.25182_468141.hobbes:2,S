Would you also make sure that Andrew has the necessary bits to keep 
Calgary going under PCI domains?  If it's a patch that sits on top of 
linux-2.6.git + my patch, I can merge it into misc-2.6.git#pciseg (which 
automatically goes into -mm).  Otherwise, make sure -mm has the stack of 
patches necessary.
