Mmmm, isn't it just _one_ big tree with different types of nodes?

Ext2, XFS, Reiserfs, NWFS, and JFS need a multi-threaded VFS.
Do we really need a screaming fast multi-threaded AFFS driver?
Tell me who is doing SPECweb99 benchmarks on AFFS.
I'd trade away some NTFS performance for a bug reduction.
Perhaps the trade would be OK for most single-user filesystems.
Somebody was doing a Commodore 64 filesystem. That just isn't
going to be mounted on /tmp except as a joke.
Yeah, I know about the Coda interface and all. People like the
ease-of-use and reliability offered by in-kernel filesystems.
Having a complex-to-simple VFS adapter would make this guy happy.
You don't have to write it or use it.

No link() and no cross-directory rename()... how in hell???
They what, move via copy and delete?
