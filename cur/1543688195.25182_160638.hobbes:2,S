yes, it is more important the possible changes in the VM.
From my small point of view we consider this:
ALSA: is very easy to configure it outside the kernel tree, without patching it.
I2C 2.8.0: (the same happens with alsa FIXME) (discussed in another thread).
XFS: the XFS needs yes or yes to patch kernel, is used enough in many instalations,
but as consequence modifies several archives of kernel, which does difficult to be able
to include some patch more after this, like for example some of security (lids, etc...).
Conclusion: I vote by VM (priority) and XFS.
