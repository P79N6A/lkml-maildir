That's only a recommendation by the FSF; many GPL-covered projects (including
the kernel and my own) do not use it.
The file COPYING in the kernel source says:
  Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel
  is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
  v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.
