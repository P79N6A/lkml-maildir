I have successfully used ext2-formatted initrd's with a variety of recent 
kernels between 2.4.16 and 2.4.18.  The only problem I've ever had is that 
when _building_ an initrd, kernels between 2.4.10 and 2.4.18-pre-something
had a bug in the ramdisk driver.  This has been fixed in later kernels, 
and there is also a workaround for it.

My workstation is running a 2.4.18-pre? which successfully mounts CDROM
ISO images on loopback and successfully creates and boots initrd's.
Are you sure this is not something specific to your setup or config?
