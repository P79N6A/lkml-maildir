Like any security solution, if the vulnerabilities are identifiable and
outlinable then the risk can be approximated. This is what is really
needed in real-life situations, reallistically, we simply want an
assessment of risk to clearly define what is and isn't acceptable level of
protection.
I will attempt to actually build attack scenarios based on these comments
and post results to any one who is interested.
Just as an aside, my solution isn't actually performing its control
through user-space params requiring copy_from_user.
Cheers,
Ahmed.
