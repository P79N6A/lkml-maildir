Yes, I know - in fact it couldn't, because your BIOS' irq routing is not
only subject to the 0x01/0x41 ambiguity but also wrong wrt. to the USBIRQ,
which gets routed using link value 0x62 in any other case but yours.
Your routing table is:
00:0c slot=01 0:01/1eb8 1:02/1eb8 2:03/1eb8 3:04/1eb8
00:0b slot=02 0:02/1eb8 1:03/1eb8 2:04/1eb8 3:01/1eb8
00:0a slot=03 0:03/1eb8 1:04/1eb8 2:01/1eb8 3:02/1eb8
00:09 slot=04 0:04/1eb8 1:01/1eb8 2:02/1eb8 3:03/1eb8
00:01 slot=00 0:01/1eb8 1:02/1eb8 2:03/1eb8 3:04/1eb8 >>> no 0x62 here!
00:13 slot=00 0:01/1eb8 1:02/1eb8 2:03/1eb8 3:04/1eb8
suggesting the ISA-bridge (00:01) would be routed exactly like a normal
PCI device, namely your SCSI-HA in slot 1. Since the ISA-bridge provides
both IDE und USB function and they pretend to use pin A, all the kernel
can do is believe the BIOS and so these 3 devices end up unseparable from
each other on link/pirq 0x01 - which we assign to some IRQ when needed.
Your USB however *is* already routed by the BIOS to IRQ 9 using link/pirq
value 0x62, which makes the BIOS provided routing table really crap:
00:01.0 ISA bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 85C503/5513 (rev 01)
60: ff 80 49 00 88 00 00 02 00 80 80 00 20 19 00 00
          ^^
Linus' patch helps you, because it makes us trusting the device's config
space over the routing table. Probably a good idea as long as BIOS'es
wouldn't start to set wrong values in config space too...
So, unless you get a working BIOS update there is no way to get it right.
Another solution might be to put your NIC into slot 1 and configure your
BIOS to share the NIC's IRQ with USB. This way you would set up the
system exactly the same way, your BIOS is cheating the kernel.

in fact vanilla 2.4.0 did believe what the bios states, namely the broken
routing table. It didn't believe however what the devices config space
reports - which turned out to be correct.
You should be happy with 2.4.1 which contains both Linus' and the
0x01/0x41 fix.
