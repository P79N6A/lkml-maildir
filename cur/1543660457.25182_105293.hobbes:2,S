I wonder if it's appropriate to copy sys_poll(), which has the +1, or
sys_select(), which doesn't!

poll(2) takes an int, but sys_poll() takes a long.
I think everyone is confused :)
The reason I suggested "long timeout" for ep_poll is because the
multiply in the expression:
	jtimeout = (unsigned long)(timeout*HZ+999)/1000;
can overflow if you don't.  If you stick with the int, you'll need to
write:
	jtimeout = (((unsigned long)timeout)*HZ+999)/1000;
