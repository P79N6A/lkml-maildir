It doesn't work that way in the U.S.  There are no special protections
for academic research, and in some cases researchers have less freedom
over their work, if the university considers them to be "under
contract."
But that's off topic.  IBM would likely never be able to justify to
its shareholders somethin as speculative as changing patent laws for
free software.
