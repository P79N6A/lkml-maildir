IIRC, rk05 was a removable disk drive, 1 platter to the assembly, about the
size of a large pizza box.  They were the standard disk drives for small DEC
machines of the era.  My memories from 30+ years ago, say they were maybe 10
pounds each.  I would imagine you are confusing tapes with disks (ie, tk<num>
instead of rk<num>) in terms of the release media Bell Labs sent out (at least
I never saw a disk with the media, and I did have a job of trying to port the
V7 compiler to a V6 system).  It could be the very early customers got disks,
and the later ones got tapes.
