I don't like it:
We should aim at having exactly one driver for one card.
Your patch has effects like e.g. a kernel behaving differently when 
adding and compiling the e1000e module later compared to having it 
originally in the .config.
And fun like "The card works on my machine with the e1000 driver, why 
doesn't it work in your machine with the e1000 driver?".
And in terms of maintainability, people will disable the e1000e driver 
in their kernel for working around bugs in it instead of reporting the 
bugs. Exactly what we want to not happen.
And unless we want to keep this situation forever, we anyway have to 
remove the support for the PCI-Express adapters from the e1000 driver at 
some point in time, so why not make a clear cut now? Whatever problems 
this causes will be the same now or in a few years.
