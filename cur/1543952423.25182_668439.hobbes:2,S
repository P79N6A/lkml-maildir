You ignore the fact that there are structures and pointers in C :) One
and the same object may be referenced from different structure objects.
For example you have an object foo saved in a cpu-local variable and
this object references another object bar (foo.bar), you might do
whatever you want to do with foo.  But if bar is a structure you might
still have to lock when you want to change the fields of it to prevent
races if this bar object can be referenced from another point like an
instance of some_struct:
PER-CPU [foo|foo|foo]
          |   |   |
          |   |   \
          |   \    +---> [bar]
          \    +---> [bar]
           +---> [bar] <--+
                           \
                       [some_struct]
A foo _might_ be protected by cpu-locality but as you can see, bar can
only be changed under lock if it is modified through foo _and_
some_struct.
I hope this clears it.  Please correct me if I am wrong or supply a
better scenario than this ;)
