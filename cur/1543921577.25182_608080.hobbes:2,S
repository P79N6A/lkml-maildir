It would be simpler/safer/saner to add a new bitflag to writeback_control
and use that directly.  The WB_SYNC_foo flags are a holdover from an
earlier time and really should be made to go away, in favour of directly
setting up an appropriate writeback_control.

Well it might lose its dirty tag, if the thread which has a lock on the
page is about to write it out or truncate it.  But that shouldn't concern
you here.
The code you have there looks racy: if someone else locks the page in that
little window after the PageLocked() test we'll still block in lock_page().
 That's unlikely to happen in your application (apart from a remaining
ab/ba scenario) but we should make it robust:
	if (wbc->skip_locked_pages) {
		if (TestSetPageLocked(page))
			continue;
	} else {
		lock_page(page);
	}
