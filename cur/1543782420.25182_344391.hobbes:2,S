In this case that works fine.  Normally they should go to linux-usb-devel
for me (and others) to read there.
Thanks, these need a bit of cleaning up, finishing, and splitting out;
they should be in 2.6.14 though.  Comments below.  Were these patches
written by you, or by Jordan?

Yeah, I noticed that one but didn't fix it yet.  It's not that
it was _never_ cleared ... only certain code paths missed it.
The systems I test with were clearly using those working paths!
Having this fixed should help get rid of the 1/4 second timer
this driver normally ties up.  That'll help make the dynamic
tick stuff work better, reducing power even when something like
"ACPI S1" doesn't exist (like say, on that one Zaurus).

Yeah, whoever did that RWC patch for UHCI ports certainly should
have checked other HCDs for the same bug.  (Kicks self.)
In fact you didn't fix this issue comprehensively.  There are
other places that register is written; they need to change too.
This is clearly wrong, but did you notice any effects more
serious than "lsusb -v" output for EHCI root hubs looking
a bit strange?

Odd, I've done that with some regularity.  Is that maybe
some kind of compiler bug?  (I heard even 4.1 isn't quite
there yet for kernels.)
The looping doesn't look incorrect to me; ports are numbered
from 1..N, and C code in the body must index them from 0..(N-1).

Well, in that one resume case anyway!
But OWNER and POWER are very different status bits ... if POWER
ever goes off, that port is by definition not resumable.  But
if a port's owned by the companion (OHCI or UHCI) controller,
then it surely ought not to be reset (even if the companion's
own SUSPEND bit doesn't show through EHCI).
