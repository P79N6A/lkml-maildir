Help!
My machine seems to be rebooting at random.  Actually, it's more like
the screen blanks, and suddenly the BIOS is going through POST.  There
may be a reset-button gnome in my case putting a jumper over the reset
pins, but I seriously doubt it. ;-) I recently tried to switch from APM
to ACPI, when i upgraded from ac9 to ac11, so I thought that might be
the cause.  So I switched back to APM with ac13 (I had the same ac12
compile problems as the rest of the world).  It's still rebooting,
without any aparent cause.
I upgraded the BIOS on this Asus A7V sometime in the past week, but I
honestly don't remember when.  From 1005C to 1007.  This was released in
march, so I assumed it was pretty stable, but it could be the cause. 
I'm going to go downgrade now, but is this more likely to be a kernel
bug, or a hardware bug/new bios bug?
Thanks,
Nathan
