The main places where machine addresses are 'visible' are any code that
holds a pte_t,pmd_t,pud_t,pgd_t. We hide the machine-to-pseudophysical and
pseudophysical-to-machine translations inside e.g., pte_val() and __pte()
(i.e., constructors and extractors for page table entries). Obviously the
users of these macros are open coded all over the place, quite apart from
the performance cost of sprinkling preempt_{enable,disable} so liberally.
