This is the wrong approach. If ORBS cannot probe me, they cannot decide
if I am a spam relayer or not. If they assume all sites they cannot
probe are spam relayers, they're wrong with certainty. Again, I don't
need orbs and I don't want to care for every random blacklister that
might exist somewhere. ORBS must not take action before they have
evidence somebody has an open relay. Plus, I've seen so many defective
relay probes...
