	Unicode may be, but UTF-8 is very useful f.e. for naming files
with cyrillic letters.

	If type all ukrainian letters in that manner one string is not enough.
You type only 9 letters with uppercase one. In ukrainian I have 37! - more
than 3 time greater. In addition there are 5! different cyrillic codetables
(866, ISO8859-5, Koi8, Mac, Win1251). If count their modifications will
be almost 10. So as for me only Unicode (UTF as variant) can solved all problems
what we have with cyrillic letters.

	I cat speak russian, ukrainian, english and henrew a litle. Yes polish
and ukrainian very similiar languages in speaking, but polish use latin letters
for writing but ukrainian use cyrillic.

	There was 50 years ago. You can also remember that 1000 years ago
was only one pra-slavonic language. But we live now in a real world.

	I need no more than one hour to make all unicode stuff in current
console driver as a configurable option. Since you know russian one saying
for you "lomat' ne stroit'" ;-).
