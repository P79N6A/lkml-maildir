Takashi, I knew you are smart enough to realize this. What is needed at 
the kernel level is a driver API that is strong enough to provide all the 
functionality needed to implement good user land libraries (including 
alsa-lib). At the same time the kernel API itself should be  suitable to 
be used in mainline applications. At this moment Jack is already used by 
most high end Linux sound apps which is good approach.

This is natural and acceptable. What is not acceptable is that 1000's of 
existing applications are forced to be converted to use some new API 
because the original one is seen as deprecated by the developers of the 
new one. Or to be forced to access the devices through some 
LD_PRELOAD hack and redundant layers of library code that provide very 
little if any added value.

This is OK as far as long as the approach taken doesn't make it impossible 
to develop the OSS API as a pure kernel API as it has been designed to be. 
Development of OSS is still continuing as a stand alone project. In the 
long term it will be open sourced and possibly given to some Xorg like 
consortium. How soon (if ever) this is going to happen is mostly a funding 
issue.
The ALSA kernel API is not documented and it's not intended to be 
used directly by the apps. If OSS is moved behind some user land wrappers 
then there is no kernel level API available for (embedded) software 
developers. Also it's very hard to believe that Linux maintainers love to 
have a kernel API that is only known to bunch of current ALSA developers 
and requires use of given library implementation (directly or indirectly).
A challenge will be finding a way how both OSS and ALSA APIs can coexist 
without disturbing each other. There are many ways (better than 
artifically forcing OSS API to be emulated in user land). I'm confident 
that something can be worked out.

I very well know this limitation. I have never claimed that everything 
can or should be done in the kernel. There is lot of stuff that can be 
done better in user land library/app code. OSS itself doesn't contain any 
library code because we think there are other developers that can do 
libraries better than we.

Completely agree. There are many things such as effect plugins that cannot 
be done in kernel space (or technically they can be done but they should 
not be done). 
However there are things like endianess conversions that can be done 
equally well in kernel space (while in an ideal world they belong to 
userland). Such simple operations don't take longer than nanoseconds to 
execute and they make implementing the user land code simplier. 
And surprise surprise there are things that can be done much better in 
kernel space than in userland. If some processing is done in the interrupt 
handler there are no scheduling latencies involved. Interrupt handlers 
fire in microseconds so the device can be programmed to interrupt after 
each sample. This in totally cannibalises the system by raising interrupt 
overhead significantly (up to 5-20%). It is known that  kernel developers 
don't like this kind of core porno at all. However if zero latency audio 
processing is the primary purpose of the system then this is the way to go.
Avoiding kernel code that can be handled in userland is the rule. But as 
you may see even this rule has some exceptions.
Best regards,
Hannu
