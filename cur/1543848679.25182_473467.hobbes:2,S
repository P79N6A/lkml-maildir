Ok.  I've been poking at these results to try and get you these answers.
 In the process I noted that the benchmark was recently reviewed and
overhauled.  Looking at the changes it looks like we are now reporting
the results from some tests which are backgrounded for additional load,
which would not have previously been reported.  So this might not be a
new phenomenon.  We have some stable tests coming through now, so I
should be able to use them as a reference to be sure.
Here are the ones which are failing currently, note that the 139 at the
start is the exit status as reported by the shell, so SIGSEGV:
bl6-13: x86_64 ext3
-------------------
139 ./fsx-linux -l 500000 -r 4096 -t 2048 -w 2048 -Z -R -W -N 10000
test/junkfile
139 ./fsx-linux -N 10000 -o 128000 -A -l 500000 -r 512 -t 4096 -w 1024
-Z -R -W test/junkfile
elm3b239: x86_64 reiserfs
-------------------------
139 ./fsx-linux -N 10000 -o 8192 -A -l 500000 -r 1024 -t 2048 -w 2048 -Z
-R -W test/junkfile
139 ./fsx-linux -N 10000 -o 128000 -r 2048 -w 4096 -Z -R -W test/junkfile
139 ./fsx-linux -N 10000 -o 8192 -A -l 500000 -r 1024 -t 2048 -w 1024 -Z
-R -W test/junkfile
I have also seen the following style messages on 19-rc1-mm1:
short write: 0x15000 bytes instead of 0xf000
Note that this really does mean a _long_ write!
