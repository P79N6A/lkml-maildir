That's not the point.
If somebody does a "git rebase", he might be changing the heads that have 
already been packed, and replacing them them with heads that have _not_ 
yet been packed. So the _dangling_ links are the old ones (in the 
pack-file), and "git-fsck-objects --full" is needed to see them.
That said, I still don't think Alan sees what he says he sees. Even if 
something crashes in the middle of a "git rebase", I think the old head 
should have been saved in .git/ORIG_HEAD, for example. 
That said, some of the more invasive operations (and "git rebase" 
certainly counts) should probably have a few "sync" operations to make 
sure that things like ORIG_HEAD really are on disk, so that we would be 
able to recreate the tree even _without_ anything like "git-fsck-objects".
