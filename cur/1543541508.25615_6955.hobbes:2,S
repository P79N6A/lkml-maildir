I'm willing to give it a try as part of a suite of tools.  I think this would go well with say a project to generalize esound to other sorts of streams (format agnostic of course).
I think what confuses people is the fact directories aren't implemented as 
collections of files but indexes to files.
I'd say a separate mailing list may also be in order.
