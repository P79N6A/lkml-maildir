I would say they don't. That's where metadata and pseudo-files sit. It's
up to the applications to do something useful with the data.

Some other OSes have similar things.

No one should store really important data inside file/ that makes the
file completely useless. I just love these postscript fonts on the Mac.
The actual main file stream is 0 bytes in size. The actual font is
inside the resource fork. When I want to convert it the Mac user needs
to pack it into a compound file using a special tool and then I can
decode it using another tool to access the PFB file. Crap.
It's useful for metadata like keywords, ACLs and these things. If you
can pack it using an aware backup program, fine. If you don't, you still
have the data.
