Subject: [PATCH] ISDN: fix drivers, by handling errors thrown by ->readstat()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is a particularly ugly on-failure bug, possibly security, since the
lack of error handling here is covering up another class of bug:
failure to handle copy_to_user() return values.
The I4L API function ->readstat() returns an integer, and by looking at
several existing driver implementations, it is clear that a negative
return value was meant to indicate an error.
Given that several drivers already return a negative value indicating an
errno-style error, the current code would blindly accept that [negative]
value as a valid amount of bytes read.  Obvious damage ensues.
Correcting ->readstat() handling to properly notice errors fixes the
existing code to work correctly on error, and enables future patches to
more easily indicate errors during operation.
