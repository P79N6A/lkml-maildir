Hey, just write the docs and post them to the linux-kbuild list.  I'll
take care of validating them against the actual kernel behaviour.

No, I don't, but I'm working on that.  Download the Dancing Makefiles and
play with them.

Patching a Makefile doesn't need to be caught.
The obvious next question is "what happens if I change the compilation
flags for foo.c", and the answer is "that does need to be caught, *is*
caught, do an "ls -a" sometime and read Documentation/smart-config.txt".
Dude, let's take this discussion over to linux-kbuild, that's what it's
for.
