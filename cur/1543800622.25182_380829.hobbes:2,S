Is this an interrupt deadlock, or do you not allow interrupt contexts
to even trylock a mutex?
If the former, I would simply use atomic_cmpxchg unconditionally for
the trylock and not use a spinlock fallback function at all.
Alternately, you may 'trylock' the spinlock, but it just seems like
extra code for not much reason (when you can use atomic_cmpxchg).
