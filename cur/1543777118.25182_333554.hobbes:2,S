Then it's definite.  The EHCI controller is issuing interrupt requests on
IRQ 21, but its driver is registered on a different IRQ.  Hence the
interrupts aren't getting handled correctly.
So probably the usb_handoff parameter won't be needed.  And if you leave 
USB 2.0 disabled in the BIOS then there's no need to hide ehci_hcd.ko, as 
it won't get loaded anyway.  You should be able to remove the test patch 
and resume normal operations.

At this point I can leave it up to the two of you.  Now that we know which
is the offending device, it should be easy to find out why the IRQ
assignments go wrong.  That certainly needs to be fixed, even though
Michel's problem appears to be solved.
