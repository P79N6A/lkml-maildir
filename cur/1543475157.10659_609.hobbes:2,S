I submitted a patch a while back that provided a set of options
allowing this to be set from 0.75G to 3G in 0.25G steps (using a
'choice' statement with 1G as the default), and I still believe this
to be the best method and granularity. 
The patch apparently missed changing arch/i386/vmlinux.lds and wasn't
applied as a result, but as I stated in a post at the time, I don't
know the language the said file is written in, so can hardly expect to
patch it appropriately......
Am I right in thinking that Ingo's patch basically expanded this patch
to edit the above file as well?
Best wishes from Riley.
