With 2.2.14pre3 and 2.2.14pre4 the network of our squid-proxy hangs after
about one day. As we never used another 2.2 kernel before, I don't know if
this this will happen with earlier version, too. But I will try a
2.2.13 tomorrow.
Hanging means: no packet is send or received.
After Executing
	ifconfig down eth0
and then restarting the network all works again and all open tcp-connections
continue receiving and sending data.
Nothing is logged.
RAM: 64KB
Swap: about 100KB
Network card: D-Link DE-530CT+, we are using the tulip driver.
We had no problems with 2.0.38.
