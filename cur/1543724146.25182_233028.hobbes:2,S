Sure thing.
I need to point out a few things:
The point of this patch was to improve the swap behaviour on desktop 
like loads.
The fact that it improved the "when swap is thrashing" scenario (in my 
testing) was an unintentional bonus.
I dont think your load of j4 will induce quite the same swap thrash as 
what I was testing. I actually suspect the faster cpu & more jobs over 
fixed memory shows it more.
I need someone with more varied hardware to test it for me. I can 
recreate equivalent results on my current machine which has similar 
hardware, but I think results showing improvement on different machines 
  and different loads is what you're looking for... and since I'm 
currently quite low on hardware I can only offer results from this one 
(and my wife is hating it being offline o_0)
Anyone willing to offer to do some tests?
