I don't think changing the Linux data structures is a problem, but you
need to be really careful not to change anything for normal machines
when writing out to / reading from the IO-APIC - that stuff is too fragile, 
and breaks on strange machines in wierd ways. 
If you can find a clean way to change the internal stuff, and just wrap 
the in/out interfaces, that would seem best to me ...
