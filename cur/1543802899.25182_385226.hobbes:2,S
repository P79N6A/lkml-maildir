Subject: [PATCH] blk: fix possible queue stall in blk_do_ordered
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/12/149

Previously, if a fs request which was being drained failed and got
requeued, blk_do_ordered() didn't allow it to be reissued, which
causes queue stall.  This patch makes blk_do_ordered() use the
sequence of each request to determine whether a request can be issued
or not.  This fixes the bug and simplifies code.

Jens, this fix is not very urgent.  The bug is not likely to be
triggered easily.  I think pushing this to -mm first would be better.
Thanks.
