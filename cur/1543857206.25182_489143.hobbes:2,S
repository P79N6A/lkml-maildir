Well, we would still need to keep the affected_cpus map in sync with the
cpu_online map. That would still require hotplug protection, right?
Besides, I would love to see a way of implementing target function to be
atomic/non-sleeping type. But as of now, the target functions call
cpufreq_notify_transition which might sleep.
That's not the last of my worries. The ondemand-workqueue interaction
in the cpu_hotplug callback path can cause a deadlock if we go for
per-subsystem hotcpu mutexes. Can you think of a way by which we can 
avoid destroying the kondemand workqueue from the cpu-hotplug callback
path ? Please see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/30/9
 for the
culprit-callpath.
Thanks and Regards
gautham.
