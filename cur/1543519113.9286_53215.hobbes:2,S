Well, I'm talking about vesafb. With vesafb you need to have the same
mode on all vts anyway. Why can't one switch the mode externally and
then tell vesafb about the parameters of the new mode? 
I agree that this won't work with chipset specific drivers (unless they
do mode switching by just reading out the register values which is not
always possible with clock chip registers for example)
