Gerneally after that, I see the following text:
Following "FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077":
tulip.c:v0.91g-ppc 7/16/99 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
eth0: Lite-On 82c168 PNIC rev 32 at 0xb800, 00:C0:F0:56:70:B9, IRQ 3.
eth0:  MII transceiver #1 config 3100 status 7829 advertising 01e1.
  PCI latency timer (CFLT) is unreasonably low at 0.  Setting to 64
clocks.
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 hda3 hda4
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 44k freed
Adding Swap: 128516k swap-space (priority 5)
So maybe it's the tulip driver... I know people have had problems with it
in the past...  I'm using a Kingston LN110TX ethernet card.  I have
noticed some weird stalls with the card in the recent 2.3.x kernels...
like 1 to 2 seconds delays in characters across a telnet session to a
local machine over a 100BaseTX connection... something which I do not
experience at all in 2.2.x kernels...  
I also thought some of the IDE changes may have brought about this
stall...  I'll investigate the problem a little later tonight with the
kdb patch (provided I can get it to apply cleanly over the kernel tree)
I'll let you know how things turn out.
