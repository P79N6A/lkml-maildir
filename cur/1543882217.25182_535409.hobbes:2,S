How are you handling the allocation in this situation, are you assuming
that a chunk is "out of bounds" because part of a file already lives on
it or simply keeping a single inode per chunk which has multiple sparse
pieces of the file on it ?
ie if I write 0-8MB to chunk A and then 8-16 to chunk B can I write
16-24MB to chunk A producing a single inode of 0-8 16-24, or does it have
to find another chunk to use ?
