Hi,
	LinSysSoft Technologies  has taken up the challenge to incorporate
Checkpoint and Block Level Incremental Backup (BLIB) support in the open
source's Ext3 File System, which is very well known for its stability,
to create a new file system called CheckFS. Block Level Incremental
Backup enables truly efficient backup and restore mechanisms.
Checkpoints provide administrators to create point-in-time copies of a
live file system by keeping track of the data blocks modified in real
time. 
For further information and a downloadable working prototype of this
technology go to :
