You  mean "left-in-pagecache-not-really-written-to-disk" synchronous ? 
Yeah. I see it..
I prefer, generic_file_aio_read_and_wait(), 
generic_file_aio_write_and_wait() - but
its ugly also :(
I also have a small issue with the current do_sync_*() routines - if 
some one calls it
without setting their ->aio_read()/->aio_write(), we panic. May be we 
should add a BUG_ON(), but again I don't want to slow things down..
Thanks,
Badari
