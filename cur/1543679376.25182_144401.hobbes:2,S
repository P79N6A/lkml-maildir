This sounds similar to what I was seeing with bug #800, only I don't
think I had taskfile IO enabled.  Another person I talked to had some
success by enabling PIIX I think, but that did not work for me.  The
only workaround that worked for me was to disable highmem support.  The
link is:

  I havn't tried it
this week, but I don't think it's been fixed yet.
Thanks,
