For all details (for 2.0.8, some things are slightly different today)
see the Large-Disk HOWTO
	
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/Large-Disk-8.html#ss8.5
The short summary is that [PTBL] in front of the geometry
means that the geometry was not taken from disk, or BIOS, or
kernel command line, but derived from the partition table.
Disk geometry is totally unrelated to disk performance.
