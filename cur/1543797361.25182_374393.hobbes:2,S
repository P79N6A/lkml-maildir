Could we please postpone it for some time?
First, the patch doesn't apply to the current -mm and the userland part is
incompatible with the code there to the extent of a serious breakage
(let alone the x86-64 issue).
Second, if I had some time to get my solution ready, we could compare the
alternatives instead of just discussing one of them.
Greetings,
Rafael
