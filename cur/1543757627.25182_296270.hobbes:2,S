This is my text, written some time ago. Some of the arguments are 
still valid, some others have been discussed in the mean time.

I have no doubt that many small improvements have been done, and LSM 
is more complete by now. My main objectives are still valid, though.

Documentation is a general problem in all projects, not only the 
kernel. For me, this has never been an issue against LSM, although 
some things, especially the weird stacking, should be documented to 
avoid errors in implementation.

Agreed to "not breaking APIs", unless unavoidable to get some 
important functionality. And certainly, all extensions must be 
optional.
I strongly object against the "no overhead" argument, as I did many 
times before. Overhead should be low, and it can be. Security comes 
with some costs - you can either say "minimize overhead at all 
costs", "maximize security at all costs", or try to make a good 
balance. IMHO, the first has been selected as a guide for LSM to get 
it accepted for mainline, which I still regard as a bad decision.
As pointed out in another reply, the actual real world overhead is 
pretty small - even with more extensive and data gathering hooks like 
those of RSBAC. Even making MAC decisions with logging checks before 
the Linux DAC decisions should be acceptable, because in almost all 
cases access will be granted anyway, so the order of calls does not 
matter.

This is a portability issue, these interfaces are very Linux specific, 
some are even kernel version specific. The good old syscall is very 
portable, and you can use a dispatcher to march dozens of calls 
through this.

There is a separate auditing subsystem now, but this was not my point. 
Access decisions can be logged where they happen, or in some central 
dispatcher.

Some people even want to override DAC, because it is quite limited. I 
agree that this is dangerous - overriding should be off by default, 
and there must be a big warning.
Actually, in RSBAC you have separate decisions for every active 
decision module - up to 13 decisions for each request, plus the 
runtime loaded modules registered through the REG facility. This is 
not a problem, if it gives you a real benefit. My usual configuration 
has 7 modules active, and the overhead is still low.

No, they do not override LSM checks - they cannot grant access, if LSM 
wants to deny it.

There are cases where Linux DAC and MAC cannot live happily together, 
because Linux DAC is too limited.
If you look at the SELinux default policy, you will see that they try 
to do everything with SELinux, because only MAC settings are trusted. 
Well, sure, this is painful, but can be necessary in some cases.
In RSBAC, you can convert Linux DAC settings to ACLs before switching 
DAC off for some directory tree. This gives you complete DAC 
settings, but makes them more flexible, fine grained and more MAC 
like than standard Linux, because administration is no longer "owner" 
based.

Again, I disagree. If you look at the age old discussion RSBAC vs. 
SELinux between Stephen Smalley and me, he criticized that even the 
few structures available in RSBAC hooks were dangerous.
Now LSM exposes many, many more of them, and expects modules to use 
them directly. Most RSBAC modules work without ever touching the few 
structures.

It is easy to freeze the kernel, but it is much easier, if you must 
access lots of structures under locking conditions you do not know 
about (and which might change between kernel versions).

It is stable for what it does - most of my points are against design, 
not implementation.

The stacking problem is a direct consequence of the design with 
distributed single user hooks. It has been criticized from the very 
beginning and since then people have been trying to solve it.
Another big problem is that there is only one pointer at some kernel 
structures for attribute data - which module is allowed to use this? 
The first? Any? How do you know whether it is used or not?

Without rechecking the current state: At least the last time I 
checked, the hardwired kernel capabilities were explicitely disabled 
when LSM got switched on. You had to use the capabilities LSM module 
instead, which was not able to stack. It always had to be the last in 
the chain, thus effectively sealing against any other LSM module to 
be loaded later.
Make a short google search for LSM and capabilities, and you will find 
loads of user problem reports for this topic. Again, this is only a 
consequence of previous design decisions for the hooks, although a 
complete implementation of the capability module would have avoided 
the problem to show.

You completely missed my point: The first LSM module decides, whether 
to call all the others or not, and so on through the chain. Most LSM 
modules do not call the others, if they want to deny access 
themselves.
This works fine with stateless security models, but it gives you a 
hell of a pain for a stateful model - or with non-access control 
modules, e.g. for virus scanners, which always want to check even for 
denied accesses.

Well, this "personal" and the other problems happen to make LSM 
unusable for RSBAC, GRSecurity and others.
The split code argument has another, severe variant:
As all hooks stand independent beside each other and there is no 
central decision function, you can never be sure that your LSM module 
catches all relevant events in a given kernel version - unless you 
inspect every kernel version and either add lots of #ifdefs, or 
restrict your module to one single kernel version.
The problem is getting worse (again) with stacking - you can never be 
sure, that you pass all relevant events to the modules registered 
after yours.
 
The concept behind the central function is the "reference monitor", a 
central component, which is guaranteed to get requests for all 
accesses to make access control decisions.

Sorry, but unfortunately, security is usually more complex than what 
most children can comprehend. A simple interface does not 
automatically make its usage simple. The side effects with locking 
and races can be severe.

Again, this was not my point. For decisions in most real security 
models, you need some metadata. You can gather this in the hooks, and 
thus avoid direct kernel data structure access, or gather it in the 
decision logic. If you do the latter, you have to redo the gathering 
in the post call - with possibly different results because of 
parallel processes.

What where your goals? Did you have a complete, more extensive 
infrastructure, which you had to change to LSM? What models did you 
implement?
Similar remarks, but the other way round, have been made for the RSBAC 
REG facility. It is also a matter of what you know better and how you 
work.

Let me express it this way: I am pretty sure that the implementation 
of a given security model is much smaller, less error prone, easier 
to port to new kernel versions and probably even significantly faster 
without further optimization, if you use the existing RSBAC 
infrastructure, than when using LSM hooks.
There are some examples of small LSM modules, which have been quickly 
ported to RSBAC and now live in the rsbac/adf/reg subdir as examples 
for runtime registration. As they do no longer need to implement 
stacking, the code became very small.

Your guess is wrong, I was hinting more at SELinux than at Immunix 
here. My statements were political, because many decisions look very 
political. And, as explicitely written, they presented my personal 
impressions on the whole process.

When this happened, it seemed clear, that after selling the patents 
anything could happen. Think of SCO and how they hindered Linux, and 
then rethink what problems might appear with clearly accepted patents 
all over the business and in various distributions.
Well, I am sure most people here agree that software patents are bad 
for free software, so let's not dig into this.

Companies are there to make money, not to provide public benefits. 
Sad, but true.

I appreciate you continued struggle against us thick headed developers 
to get a better common solution. Still, some problems are deeper than 
they appear, and you will often have politics or even massive company 
interests involved.
