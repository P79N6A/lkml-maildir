Subject: [ PATCH 0/4] UML - Four for 2.6.22
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/4/595

These four patches tidy code, improve debug output, and comment
pre-existing or pre-lacking locking.
They should wait for 2.6.22.
