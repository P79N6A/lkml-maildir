Please try this patch that just got included in linus tree.
ChangeSet 1.1360, 2003/10/27 00:01:25-08:00, rusty@rustcorp.com.au
	[NETFILTER]: Fix ipchains oops in NAT
	We updated ip_nat_setup_info to set the initialized flag and call
	place_in_hashes, but *didn't* change the call in ip_fw_compat_masq.c
	which also calls place_in_hashes() itself (again!).  Result: corrupt
	list, and next thing which lands in the same hash bucket goes boom.
	Thanks to Andy Polyakov for chasing this down.
