Aha. And what would be your advice ? Rather leave the BIOS mouse option ON and 
use "usb-handoff", or remove both ?
I'll check without both tomorrow anyway, it's a bit late tonight for keeping 
on breaking the machine ;-)

Hmmm... I've seen... 2.6.12 is the first release that seems to be willing to 
work on my system -- with some tweaking, coffee and aspirin. Previous 2.6.x 
releases I had tried (2.6.3, 2.6.6) were horribly broken on my poor VIA 
hardware ;-)
Cheers.
