I prefer diffs between x.y.z.w-1 and x.y.z.w. x.y.z.{...,w-1,w,w+1,...} is one
stream of development, x.y.{...,z-1,z,z+1,...} is another one.
BTW, I always found it pretty rare that the rc patches weren't like that.
`unpatching' w-1 and `patching' w afterwards isn't fun if you have local
changes.

P.S. Personally I wouldn't suffer from unpatching and patching, since I use
     merging (using a script that does recursive merges with RCS merge). But if
     I would not be an architecture maintainer but just a plain user who
     sometimes does a few hacks (or applies some patches from others) on his
     kernel, I would just want to apply the x.y.z.w-1-to-x.y.z.w patch, fixup
     the (hopefully few) rejects, and be happy...

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
