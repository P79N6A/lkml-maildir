Peter, can you just remove this patch from your kernel, I don't know how
to fix it. It does something bad to all the resource allocations. The
child resources don't find the parent any more, and you can see the result
in /proc/iomem and /proc/ioport clearly. The cardbus devices are not seen
as "children" of the cardbus controller any more from a resource
standpoint.
So can you go back to the setup before applying this patch, and do a
debugging run of that version instead?
