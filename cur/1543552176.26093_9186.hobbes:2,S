Sorry to mislead you - I only mentioned 2.4.X to note that I
observed the same IRQ-transform behavior there, not to say
that there was a broken 2.4.X driver.  The 2.2.X driver in
question is serial.c with patches from MBV to support one of
their RAStel multi-modem cards, and it is apparently broken
in the manner I described.  Thanks for the clarification.
