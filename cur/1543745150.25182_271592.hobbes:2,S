I had originally used a patch that was in one of our developers trees
which was different from the one in your most recent -mm tree.  The patch
I was using had a missing list_del(... i_list); or something like that.
I could dig out the exact line if you want to sanity check me, but I
don't have it handy right now.  With the patch in your tree, I have not
seen any NULL pointer dereferences.

I would strongly encourage merging the three patches we have talked about
here.  I understand you would typically keep my BKL patch in your tree for
awhile and think that would be just fine.  The changes only affect systems
that have filesystems being unmounted with a large number of inodes.
With the two patches already in your tree, the pauses are greatly reduced
for the autofs case that originally got me looking.
Thanks,
