I agree.

agree on this either. Good point.

maybe task_container? i.e. where task actually is.
Sounds good for you?
The only problem with such names I see, that task will be an exception 
then compared to other objects. I mean, on other objects field 
"container" will mean the container which object is part of. But for 
tasks this will mean effective one. Only tasks need these 2 containers 
pointers and I would prefer having the common one to be called simply 
"container".
Maybe then
current->econtainer    - effective container
current->container     - "long term" container

Your proposal looks quite nice.
Then we will have eventually "container" field on objects (not on task 
only) which sounds good to me. I will prepare patches right now.
