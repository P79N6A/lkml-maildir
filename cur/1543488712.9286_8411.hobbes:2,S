There's a 2.2.2 SMP system next to me with two eepro100 cards configured
thusly:
eth0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:A0:C9:DF:6C:83
        inet addr:128.110.147.25  Bcast:128.110.147.255 Mask:255.255.255.0
        UP BROADCAST RUNNING PROMISC MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
        RX packets:2944631 errors:1 dropped:0 overruns:1 frame:1115
        TX packets:2080795 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:1
        collisions:284511 
eth0:0  Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:A0:C9:DF:6C:83  
        inet addr:128.110.147.26  Bcast:128.110.147.255 Mask:255.255.255.0
        UP BROADCAST RUNNING PROMISC MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
eth1    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:A0:C9:DF:6D:E8  
        unspec addr:[NONE SET]  Bcast:[NONE SET]  Mask:[NONE SET]
        EtherTalk Phase 2 addr:37656/52
        UP BROADCAST RUNNING PROMISC MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
        RX packets:19729638 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:97389
        TX packets:3886 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
        collisions:195
Lo and behold, 'tcpdump -i eth0 arp' reveals:
17:17:17.297366 arp who-has raven.umnh.utah.edu (Broadcast) tell crow
17:17:17.297430 arp reply raven.umnh.utah.edu is-at 0:a0:c9:df:6c:83
17:17:17.297522 arp reply raven.umnh.utah.edu is-at 0:a0:c9:df:6d:e8
when the machine is pinged - even though eth1, the 0:a0:c9:df:6d:e8
interface has only an EtherTalk address.  'ifconfig eth1 -arp' kills the
spurrious replies, but also kills netatalk.  Is this a kernel problem, a
configuration problem, or a problem with my head?
