For some research I am doing, I need to be able to clear cached file
data (both dirty and clean) from the buffer and page caches.  I've poked
around the caches and tried a few things, but failed.  Can anyone give
me some suggestions on the proper approach to take or some pointers to
where to start looking?  I am currently using kernel version 2.3.32.
Thanks,
honus
