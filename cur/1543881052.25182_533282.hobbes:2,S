It might be nice if it was possible to actively contribute your CPU  
time to a child process.  For example:
int sched_donate(pid_t pid, struct timeval *time, int percentage);
Maybe a way to pass CPU time over a UNIX socket (analogous to  
SCM_RIGHTS), along with information on what process/user passed it   
That would make it possible to really fix X properly on a local  
system.  You could make the X client library pass CPU time to the X  
server whenever it requests a CPU-intensive rendering operation.   
Ordinarily X would nice all of its client service threads to +10, but  
when a client passes CPU time to its thread over the socket, then its  
service thread temporarily gets the scheduling properties of the  
client.  I'm not a scheduler guru, but that's what makes the most  
sense from an application-programmer point of view.
