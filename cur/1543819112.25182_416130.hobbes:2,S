Hello
I am runnig a 2.6.16.1 kernel on a DFI LP NF4 SLI-DR Expert mobo, which 
has an nvidia chipset with onboard nic. The nic works fine with the 
forcedeth driver, perfomance is ok (good). The system is a x86_64 FC5 
install on a dual core opteron 170 cpu with 2GB (2x1GB in dual channel) 
of Ram installed.
When I suspend the machine using ACPI S3 or swsup and resume it the 
network is dead. I cannot recive an packages. ifdown / ifup does not 
help. Restarting the network using /sbin/service network restart also 
does not get network working. Unloading and loading the driver (modprobe 
-r forcedeth;modprobe forcedeth) has the same result-> dead network.
I have to reboot in order to get the network working again. I have a 
static IP so no dhcp issue.
This makes suspend useles on my box, because I have to reboot anyway to 
get my network working.
What could be causing this? If there is any info that I can provide to 
help fixing this bug tell me.
I also noticed this (don't know if it is related or not but doubt it):
 cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:     640968     628532    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:       4763       4745    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  8:          0          0    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
  9:          0          0   IO-APIC-level  acpi
 14:       1552       1082    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 15:      44443      44261    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
 16:      57625      44633   IO-APIC-level  libata
 17:     972904          0   IO-APIC-level  eth0
...
why does all interupts of eth0 (forcedeth) goes to cpu 0 and never to 1 
? irqbalance is running.
