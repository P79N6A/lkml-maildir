Hi,
My HP notebook decided that its BIOS upgrade would break
speedstep-centrino, and trying to load the module gives me a "no such
device" error. This is with various combinations of kernel config
relating to cpufreq. Also tried acpi-cpufreq with the same error.
I suspect that the new bios is broken, but perhaps it's correct and the
linux driver is missing something?
I've put relevent info at this URL (the list server thought it was
spam):

Cheers,
Ben
