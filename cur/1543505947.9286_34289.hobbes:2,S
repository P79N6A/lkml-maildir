From the homepage, updated two days ago:

Latest news: 
August 13th, 1999 -- We are working on the kernel patches. It doesn't
look like it will be included in time for kernel 2.4.x, but things are
coming together. Work on 2.3.x is basically done, but we may have a few
patches to keep it working under the newer experimental kernels. Look
for a new release of Lm-sensors soon which will be in the form of a
kernel patch and a user-app directory. [...]
