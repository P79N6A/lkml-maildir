This looks like the same error you would get if these drivers were
compiled as modules and not placed in the initrd.  The RT patch adds the
-V0.7.47-03 to the version of the kernel so the modules do get loaded
into a different /lib/modules directory and should have a different
initrd file.  Make sure that your initrd is correct, or just compile the
necessary modules into the kernel (not as modules).
