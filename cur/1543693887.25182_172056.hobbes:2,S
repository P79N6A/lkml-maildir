This is not a theory, but we were really caught by this bug.

> Hi,
> 
> There is a bug in cpufreq call back funtion in timer_tsc routines,
> that can result in system deadlock. The issue is: grabbing the
> write_lock on xtime_lock without disabling the interrupts. So,
> if we happen to get a timer interrupt while we are in this code,
> system will go into a deadlock.
> 
> This bug only effects the kernels that have CONFIG_CPU_FREQ enabled.
> Attached patch fixes it. Please apply.
