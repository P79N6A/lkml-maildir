This option actually disables VGA probing kernel wide - it essentially 
skips all of video.S during boot, and then disallows any drivers that may
depend on that data (VGA console being the prime example).
While I am about 85% sure that probing the missing VGA/VESA registers will 
not cause any problems, the values read will be nonsense, and I wanted to 
avoid the possibility that any part of the code will blindly use the 
returned data without checking it. 
The option is triggered off of EMBEDDED, and I felt it would be buried 
deep enough to not cause heartburn to the casual user.
