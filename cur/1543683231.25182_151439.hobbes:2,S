You test with bash, which is a complicated program with many
subtleties related to job control and terminal control. Things will be
easier with ash instead of sh.
But to answer your concrete question: bash does
	ioctl(0, TCSETSW, foo);
which is the same as POSIX
	tcsetattr(0, TCSADRAIN, foo);
which does some setting, but first waits for the output buffer to drain.
It will never drain, unless the other side of the pty does some reading.
