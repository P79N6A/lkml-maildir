Hello,
I am now thinking of a way to verify what H. Peter Anvin says about the 
ramdisk, so that I can watch what is going on when the executable is running. 
Is there any way to achieve that besides kernel debugging? I don't really want 
to debug the kernel for now.
Can I get the physical address of the text section with it's virtual address? 
If I can know the physical address of the code in ramdisk and can know the 
physical address of the text section of process address space, maybe this can 
be done.
Any suggestions?
Lei
