Mihai,
You missed one thing out of your report, the console message xfs output 
before
this.
I suspect it would have been this: xfs_iget_core: ambiguous vns: vp/0x .....
but it would be good to confirm it. This was supposed to be a dead code
path which there was no longer a route to, it is possible something in the
NFS interface in 2.6 has changed to cause this though. Basically a race
between two threads looking up the same inode, xfs has it cached already
and two threads raced to setup the mapping from the linux inode.
The use of iget_locked when looking up new inodes is supposed to protect
against just this condition.
