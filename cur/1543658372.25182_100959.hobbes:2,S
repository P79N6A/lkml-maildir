Maybe it's not working because you need to flush the journal before
the ext2 tool will see the inode as deleted.  Alternatively, if that
is the case, perhaps by ignoring the data in the journal, the file
would not appear to be deleted.
Why not make a copy of the partition in to a file, and mount that file
using the loopback device - then you can try flushing the journal,
discarding the journal, etc.
John.
