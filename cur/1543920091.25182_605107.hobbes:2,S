No, it doesn't.  James Bottomley has been exceedingly polite and helpful, as 
were several other people on the linux-scsi list when I asked them about this 
stuff back in August.
Religion, politics, and anything remotely related to hotplug appear to be 
topics to avoid in polite company if you want it to remain polite.  (My 
gripes with scsi mostly have to do with device enumeration.  My attempts to 
use sysfs also have to do with device enumeration.  I've spotted a trend 
here.)
