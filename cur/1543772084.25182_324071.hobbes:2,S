Hello everybody,
Dumb question here.
I have an Athlon-thunderbird (1.2Ghz) on kernel 2.4.31 with mttr configured 
and a nVidia Geforce4.  /proc/mtrr is empty.
Does/is setting up mtrr per the old 1999 Docs/mtrr.txt still relevant 
nowadays?  I can't seem to find a definitive answer using Google.
TIA,
Nick
