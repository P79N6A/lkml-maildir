According to Documentation/pci.txt: pci_resource_start() is to return the bus start address of the bar. It should essentially be a portable way to obtain the bar value without reading PCI config space directly.
We have encountered at least 2 platforms (HP Integrity (IA-64) Olympia rx8620 partition, and a dual-processor IBM eServer pSeries p615) - where the contents of pci_resource_start() vary from the contents of the BARs in config space. For example:
on IA64 Olympia: pci_resource_start(pcidev,0) = 0x00000f0030040000; pci bar0 word 0xf0040004, bar1 word 0x0 
On PPC eServer:  pci_resource_start(pcidev,0) = 0x000003fd80000000; pci bar0 word 0xc0000004, bar1 word 0x0 
We have demonstrated this on both the 2.4.21 and 2.6.5 kernels.
Are these platform bugs that need to be corrected ? or is it a change in the pci_resource_start() definition ?
