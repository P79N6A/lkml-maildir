Hello,

This is an ext3 partition, and a SCSI disk :
4 [18:10] rol@donald:/kernels> df .
Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1             10320888    753828   9042724   8% /kernels
Do you think I should try on some other ?
The problem is that the system is *globally* slow, and compiling
the kernel is just a way to prove it. Starting KDE has become a real
pain (so slow screen detects no more video and enter Energy Saving
mode before reactivating and switching to Graphic mode).
Regards,
Paul
