True, however, IMNSHO it would be much better if the kcore/kabi stuff  
had
a _consistent_ namespace as well.  If every macro begins with "__KABI_"
and every type and function with "__kabi_" (With a few function-like  
macro
exceptions, of course), then it is trivial to see where it originally  
came
from and provides a standard naming scheme that external parties can  
kind
of rely upon.  It also means there are fewer exceptions to remember when
coding.  My thought for the __[us][0-9]+ types is that they should still
be defined in linux/types.h for compatibility (outside of __KERNEL__)  
and
based off the __kabi_* types.
Cheers,

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so
simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is  
to make
it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.  The first  
method is
far more difficult.
