Hi again,
I can't manage to reproduce the problem on my home box, based on redhat7
... thttpd runs ok on 2.2.18 with raid patch, 2.2.18-cdhs
(www.linuxraid.org) and 2.2.19pre3aa4 ... I tought it might be some
compiler/glibc problem, but even if i get a kernel and a statically
compiled thttpd from the box that is making problems(rh6.0) and run it
here, it runs ok ... 
What more can i try? I'd really like to find out what's going on ... 
I checked those bits Alan Cox mentioned and cdhs patch puts them like
this (include/linux/fs.h btw):
#define BH_LowPrio      7       /* 1 if the buffer is lowprio */
#define BH_Wait_IO      8       /* 1 if we should throttle on this
buffer */
Andrea, in your pre3aa4 patch you put them vice versa:
#define BH_Wait_IO      7       /* 1 if we should throttle on this
buffer */
#define BH_LowPrio      8       /* 1 if the buffer is lowprio */
I dont think this really matters, but which way should be official? :)
and btw, happy new year to all of you.
