Bull shit. Standard policy is currently to keep crude old
interfaces until no end of time. Here are some examples:
/proc/meminfo
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  196005888 60133376 135872512        0  3280896 31088640
Swap: 410255360        0 410255360
MemTotal:       191412 kB
MemFree:        132688 kB
MemShared:           0 kB
Buffers:          3204 kB
The first lines could have gone 2 years ago.
/proc/ksyms - this is duplicating a system call (and making stuff easier
for intrusors)
/proc/modules - same as /proc/ksysms - entierly unneccessary and
obsolete,
since 3 years!
And so on and so on...
