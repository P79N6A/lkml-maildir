And it works great!

Since the alternative is to sit there and do NOTHING until the
reconstruction is complete, ala Solaris 2.5, it's WONDERFUL the way it
is.  This change was extensively discussed on the raid mailing list a
couple of years ago.  You can look it up for review.

You can't be serious.  Go sit down and think about what's going on.

You probably have your fstab incorrectly setup.

#The "pass" field in /etc/fstab is for exactly this: fsck -a will
#serialise devices with different pass numbers.  Pass==1 is for root,
#pass==2 is for normal devices which fsck knows how to serialise.  If you

Do a little work, it won't hurt you.  Fsck should not (and may not be
able to) decode metadevice structures.
Your third part was ignored, given the above.
