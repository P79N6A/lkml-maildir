Well, I had a good reason.  You know how to un-pull, I know how to
un-remote to get back to pristine after I'm done testing... guaranteed
without whimpering pathetically on the git list ;-)
Anyway, I checked out the one with the big-fat-hint in it's name
(block-for-linus/for-linus).
Same error.  Git this morning with patches...
	restore_meaning_of_data_len.diff
	seperate_out_padding_from_alignment.diff
...reverted restored me to the originally reported k3b error, nothing
new noted.
If I tested the wrong branch, whack me upside the head, and I'll follow
your pull destructions, and figure out how to un-pull later.
