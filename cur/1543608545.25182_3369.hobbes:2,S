Another interpretation, which seems pretty common (we use this one at
Transmeta, for example) is to treat the version ID as the "minor
revision" (indicating an upward compatible change) and the device ID
as the "major revision" (change this to indicate an incompatible
change in the programming interface.)
Unfortunately PCI doesn't have the very nice "compatible with" list
that ISAPnP has -- that, and the "human readable string" were very
useful features of the ISAPnP spec.
