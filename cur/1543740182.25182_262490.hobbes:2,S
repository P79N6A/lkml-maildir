Isn't this interrupt disabled at that point, and status are cleared
right
after handoff ? Have you actually been able to see a problem with such 
an interrupt with this patch applied ?

That would be nice, but -mm patch covers not only keyboard/mouse issues,
but lockups as well. Unfortunately, to work around this, handoff should 
happen not only pretty early, but before you start enabling shared (with
USB)
interrupts for your cards.
