      ^^^^^
I had expected gcc specialists to jump on that one: if you don't
explicitly tell gcc that an input is clobbered, it may reuse it later if
it needs the same value. So the clobbers are necessary...
Your statement about output operands is also incorrect, since clobbered
means that the register has an unknown value, which can not be used for
_anything_, while outputs are results from the statement and they'll
likely be used later (if none of the outputs is ever used and the asm 
statement is not marked volatile, gcc will not even bother to emit it).
