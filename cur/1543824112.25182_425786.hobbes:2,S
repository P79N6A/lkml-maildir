If it was less than 5%, I'd agree with you. The fact is, it's 17% better on a 
regular kernel tarball (not exactly a contrived test), so there would be 
reason to use it. It's also faster to decompress.

This utility appears to address most of my original concerns (i.e., it works 
with stream LZMA and has a bzip2/gzip-esque frontend). I could see LZMA 
replacing bzip2, but not gzip, due to the compression performance issues.
