Yeap, right.  I higher, lower, same, whatever.  I was using the term as
drivers usually register to upper layers.

Agreed.  That layer is responsible for managing lingering objects and
telling its users that the device is a zombie now.

I definitely can be mis-assessing the problem.  I'll first give a shot
at the block/SCSI layer.  How about that?

Ah.. I see.  You're right in that driver B cannot wait for disconnect in
its remove routine in the above code but using a separate mutex to
protect ->gone should do the trick, so I don't think the above case is a
big problem.  It's a pretty specific case which is easy to spot and update.
Thanks.
