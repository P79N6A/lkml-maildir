If you use plain malloc(), you're not allowed to think you have any
space guaranteed. It's bad programming. If you need guaranteed "space"
(memory) use another kernel interface, such as mlock(). I'm not saying
the current interface is perfect. I'm just saying that overcommitting
is not the problem.  You don't need to turn overcommiting off. You
need you use a better interface than malloc() to get "safe" memory.
For stack grow, maybe we need some way to tell the kernel:
"never page-out my stack, and reserve me this space...".
Applications should be able to bypass kernel management of their address
space. But this should be done on a per-app base.
