It is not necessarily good idea for constants that are
used only once on initialization. May be a side
comment will be better. I'll check this out.

It appears that any socket can hold any card type. So
the logic goes as following:
1. Get insertion interrupt on socket
2. Detect card type
3. Stick proper handler to the socket
...do work
4. Get removal interrupt on socket
5. Ditch type-specific handler, mark socket as empty
A quick example: on 8033 sd cards are most often wired
to socket 3, while on 803b they are wired to socket 1.

I'm afraid you'll have to clarify this issue further.
Consider the following: TI uses look up table to set
command type register. The decoding of this table is
my tifm_sd_op_flags. Its output directly sent to
hardware. Can you notice any bit patterns here:
Response type (4b):
R1 - 1     R1b - 9 (so highest 1 is MMC_RSP_BUSY)
R2 - 2     R3 - 3      R6 - 6
(if bit 1 is MMC_RSP_136 why it is set for R3 and R6;
and if it's MMC_RSP_CRC why it is not set for R1?)
Command type (2b):
BC - 0 (implied)   BCR  - 1
AC - 2             ADTC - 3 
(even if higher bit stands for "addressed vs
broadcast" it still doesn't make sense for lower bit).
By the way, if I recall correctly, SD spec does not
splits command types and responses into components. It
always speaks of R1s and R6s and so on.

It's not hard to figure out bits that are used
systematically. The problem is that there are 4 or 5
registers that are set to some constant at
initialization. I made all kinds of trials with them
and got no conclusive idea on their meaning.
