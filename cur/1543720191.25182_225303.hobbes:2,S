	While we are at it, the function in question
(sound/core/pcm_misc.::snd_pcm_format_silence_64())
is a plain and simple array in disguise - it should've been
u_int64_t snd_pcm_format_silence_64(snd_pcm_format_t format)
{
	unsigned index = snd_enum_to_int(format); /* just a cast, hopefully */
	return index < SNDRV_PCM_FORMAT_LAST ? filler[index] : -EINVAL;
}
And -EINVAL here, BTW, is a broken interface - none of its callers are
checking for -EINVAL and that's a hell of an odd error value when normal
values can be all over the place in u64 anyway.
Looking at those callers, I'd say that this guy should be
unsigned char * find_filler(snd_pcm_format_t format)
and return a pointer to a (8-element) row in array of patterns.  Because
callers end up truncating the result and then filling a large area with
repeated copies.  All we get from use of u_int64_t is extra PITA with
endianness - memcpy from 1/2/4/8 element array is no less efficient than
assignment from u8/u16/u32/u64.
