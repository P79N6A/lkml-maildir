Does this mean that you are OK with having a mechanism to mark the
sockets as critical and dropping the non critical packets under
emergency, but you do not like having a separate critical page pool.
Instead, you seem to be suggesting in_emergency to be set dynamically
when we are about to run out of ATOMIC memory. Is this right?
