Well, I've seen nothing more than the 82801DB (which was listed in
lspci). So maybe there is no HRNG :(
This leaves the main problem, which is the lack of entropy. Does anyone
have an idea on how to solve this problem ?
It appeared with recent kernels. For ex, 2.6.8 had an entropy pool
always > 3000, while 2.6.18 and other recent kernels show ~ 150.
# sysctl kernel.random.poolsize
kernel.random.poolsize = 4096
# sysctl kernel.random.entropy_avail
kernel.random.entropy_avail = 196
This is really annoying, since the box should also use SSL/TLS
operations, and it will be real slow ..

Pierre
