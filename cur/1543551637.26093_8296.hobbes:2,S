The stuff linked to from there seems to cover the higher-level VM
aspects like balancing the VM.  Basically arch-independent stuff.
I'm looking for info on the impact the 2.4 changes will have on the
"API" between the arch-indep and arch-dep code.  For example, 2.2
assumes that you can access <phys-addr> by referencing 
<phys-addr> + PAGE_OFFSET.  AFAIK, this is no longer true in 2.4.
So what's the new mechanism for accessing physical memory?
OK, this particular question is easily answered by reading the 
source...
<Surprise!>
__pa() and __va() are still defined as addr -/+ PAGE_OFFSET.  So
where did I hear about 2.4 not mapping all memory?  Could it be
that this applies only to "high memory" in x86?
Dazed and confused,
Kenn
