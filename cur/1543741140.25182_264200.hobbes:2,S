also note that (as i mentioned it in an earlier reply to Paul) the
'CPU[s] isolated for hard-RT use' scheduler feature has already been
implemented by Dimitri Sivanich and was accepted and integrated into the
2.6.9 kernel a couple of weeks ago.
Isolated CPUs can be set up via the "isolcpus=" boot parameter, and can
be entered via the affinity syscall. The feature came with related fixes
to the scheduler and other kernel code to eliminate cross-effects
between domains. (such as the scheduler balancing code, or the swap
tick)
So this all is banging on open doors, this particular mode of hard-RT
scheduling is there and available in vanilla Linux. If anyone wants to
try it, just download 2.6.9 and use it.
