If we're on an SMP system and the monitored task is currently running,
then it's not just the read syscall, there's also the IPI, which will
add considerably to the cost.  So it's likely to be a thousand or more
cycles between the two counter reads, which is IMHO unacceptable.
Anyway, that's not my major problem with the API, just one of its
little annoyances...

I never defended the use of ptrace, and it isn't IMO an essential part
of the perfmon API, just an aspect of its current implementation.

And this tells me what?  I can't relate any of these measurements to
any others, because I don't know how many cycles or instructions or
milliseconds each of these counts relates to, and I don't know which
counts were taken at the same time as which other counts.
Your abstraction hides all the details of what is being counted with
which counter over what period of time, and that is absolutely crucial
information for any serious analysis of the numbers.

I'm not sure those quoted statements are exactly what I said, but
whatever.
Your API has as its central abstraction the "counter".  I am saying
that that is the wrong abstraction.  The abstraction really needs to
be a set of counters that are all active over precisely the same
interval, so that their values can be meaningfully compared and
related to each other.

Well, here's my reasoning.
* Your perf_counter_open call takes the event type but doesn't have
  any way to select a particular hardware counter (deliberately, since
  your API is trying to present some common-denominator abstraction of
  the individual counters).
* On powerpc, the event selector value to count a particular event is
  different for each counter, and may even depend on what's being
  counted on other counters.
* That means that we can't meaningfully pass raw (negative) event
  selector values, since what any particular value means depends on
  which hardware counter we get to use, and we don't know that (and in
  fact it may change from time to time).
* In other words, the kernel will have to know the mapping from
  abstract event types to event selector values for each counter for
  each supported CPU type.
Now, the tables in perfmon's user-land libpfm that describe the
mapping from abstract events to event-selector values and the
constraints on what events can be counted together come to nearly
29,000 lines of code just for the IBM 64-bit powerpc processors.
Your API condemns us to adding all that bloat to the kernel, plus the
code to use those tables.
Furthermore, since your generic code doesn't know anything about the
constraints and thinks it can just add any counter to any task at any
time (subject only to a maximum number of counters in use), we'll
potentially have to work out event selector values at latency-critical
times such as context switches and interrupts.

The ability to create event records in a ring buffer is certainly
nice.  I have no problem with that part of your proposal, particularly
if we can optionally record things like a timestamp, task registers,
stacktrace, etc. at the same time, as you have suggested.
My point is that the monitoring task wants to be able to control which
things get measured simultaneously.  The kernel shouldn't be deciding
how the set of software counters gets multiplexed onto the hardware
counters - the monitoring task needs to be able to control that in
order to get meaningful results.
There are three other problems that I see with your API (these are
probably fixable):
1. I don't see any way to control whether I'm counting events in user
   mode, kernel mode, hypervisor mode, or some combination.  That is
   needed for some types of performance analysis.
2. If I'm counting events for all tasks, I want to be able to exclude
   the idle task, optionally.  I don't see a way to do that.
3. If I have a counter in PERF_RECORD_IRQ mode, I have no way to read
   its actual value, which I would want to do (for instance, when some
   other counter overflows, or when the task exits).
