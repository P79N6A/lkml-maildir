Define "idle" ?
Is idle the time it takes between two readahead requests
to be issued, delaying the second request because you
just moved the disk arm away ?
Is idle when we haven't had a request for, say, 3 disk
seek time periods ?
Is idle when we won't be getting any request soon for the
area where the disk arm is hanging out ?  (and how do we
know the future?)
regards,
Rik
