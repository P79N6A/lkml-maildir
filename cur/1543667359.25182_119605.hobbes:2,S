You're thinking the wrnog way around.  Locking reduction / splitting is
trivial, getting the algorithms right is the hard part.  Getting rid
of BKL in chardev open is a matter of simple search and replace and I expect
it to happen before 2.6.

No, Andries did not do it symmetric to the block devices.

Dynamic numbers are there today and have been for ages.

I do see it going away.  Dito for /proc/devices.  They already are
inaccurate for those midlevel drivers that partition their major number
themselves and having the ranges properly exported like it's already
done for block devices is the proper replacement.  Yes, this breaks
userspace and we'll have to live with it.
