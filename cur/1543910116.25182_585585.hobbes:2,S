Probably you didn't mean that, but no, schedule() is not barrier because
it sleeps. It's a barrier because it's invisible.

True, that's clearly what happens here. But are you're definitely joking
that this is "obvious" in terms of code-clarity, right?
Just 5 minutes back you mentioned elsewhere you like seeing lots of
explicit calls to barrier() (with comments, no less, hmm? :-)
