The problem is not at all related to the IO-wait addition,
and no you don't bail out with an error... procps 3 does
bail out, elsewhere, causing the mistaken belief that procps 2
runs correctly on a WOLK kernel. That's wrong; no procps runs
correctly on a WOLK kernel.
I mentioned the issue merely to avoid bogus bug reports.
I don't want WOLK kernel users claiming that procps 2 works
and procps 3 not; the truth is that neither one can work
on a WOLK kernel.

Great.
jim.houston@attbi.com seems to have most of a patch for
the %CPU problem. (tracking the data, but not reporting it)
What about /proc/*/tty, an adopted-child flag, something for
the kapmd-idle problem, /proc/*/threads/* files, etc. ?
