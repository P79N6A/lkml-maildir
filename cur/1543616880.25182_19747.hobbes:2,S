Good point.  In fact, I have an "ll patch" for preempt-kernel, it is
called lock-break and available at
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/lock-break
While I am not so sure this sort of explicit work is the answer -- I'd
much prefer to work on the algorithms to shorten lock time or lock into
different locks -- it does work.  The work is based heavily on Andrew's
ll patch but designed for use with preempt-kernel.  This means we can
drop some of the conditional schedules that aren't needed, and in others
we don't need to call schedule (just drop the locks).
