Indeed!
Two years ago, in Q1-98, I submitted a proposal at Seagate to develop disk
drives with a wireless network interface. I developed the idea to the point
of suggesting a solution utilizing the unlicensed 2.4GHz ISM band. This
solution would have implemented a spread spectrum wireless link. At these
frequencies, we could have attained the necessary bandwidth to make a viable
product. (No flames please, I am aware of the Bluetooth consortium, but that
standard transmits at data rates that make it useless for mass storage.)
Imagine a wireless disk drive attached to an office ceiling. People come and
go and are connected to LAN-centric memory without any cables...
Anyway Larry, we did this __TWO__ years ago. Integrating a network interface
into disk drives is not visionary... I realize this is a bit presumptuous of
me, but may I suggest you really should dis-engage your ego from your work...
OTOH, your posts are quite entertaining, combining theatre and
engineering... Now that is visionary... :) Please don't be offended. We need
to be able to laugh at ourselves to make a better world...
Karen
