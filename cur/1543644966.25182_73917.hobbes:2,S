Subject: [RFC] LSM changes for 2.5.38
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
Here are some patches against the latest 2.5 BK tree that add some
further LSM hooks and documentation to the tree.  There is also one
minor change to fs/inode.c to allow security modules more information
about newly created inodes.
These changesets can be found at bk://lsm.bkbits.net/linus-2.5 and I'll
be attaching the individual patches as responses to this email for those
who don't want to mess with bitkeeper.
If anyone has any questions or comments on these patches, please let us
know.  Otherwise I'll be sending them off to Linus in a few days.
thanks,
greg k-h

  [PATCH] LSM: inode.c init modification

  Here's a patch that attempt to support the same functionality without
  inserting hooks into filesystem-specific code.  This patch permits the
  security module to perform initialization of the inode security state
  based on the superblock information, enabling SELinux to initialize
  pipe, devpts, and shm inodes without relying on inode_precondition to
  catch them on first use.
  
  This is achieved simply by moving the initialization of inode->i_sb
  before the call to inode_alloc_security, enabling the
  inode_alloc_security hook function to perform the allocation and
  initialization for such inodes.  No new hooks are required.

  [PATCH] LSM: misc hooks addition
  
  The patch below (relative to the LSM IPC hooks patch) adds the LSM hooks
  for miscellaneous system operations (module_*, sethostname, setdomainname,
  reboot, ioperm/iopl, sysctl, swapon/swapoff, syslog, settime).  It also
  replaces the hardcoded capability tests in the OOM killer code with
  appropriate calls to the LSM capable hook, preserving the original behavior
  as long as the capabilities module is enabled.
