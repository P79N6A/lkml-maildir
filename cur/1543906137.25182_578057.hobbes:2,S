thanks. Just to make sure, while you said that your TSC was off on that 
laptop, the bootup log of yours suggests a working TSC:
  Time: tsc clocksource has been installed.
and still your fl.c testcases produces the top output that you've 
reported in your first mail? If so then this could be a regression. Or 
did you turn off the tsc manually via notsc? (or was it with a different 
.config or on a different machine)? Please help us figure this out 
exactly, we dont want a real regression go unnoticed.
If you can reproduce that problem with a working TSC then please 
generate a second cfs-debug-info.sh snapshot _while_ your fl+l workload 
is running and send that to me (i'll reply back to it publicly). Thanks,
	Ingo
