Right.  And even though cleaning up no longer needs to drop a reference
to the kset, it still might need to free the kobject's name.  So for 
example, either of these sequences:
	kobject_init();			kobject_set_name();
	kobject_set_name();		kobject_init();
	...				...
	kobject_free();			kobject_free();
would leak memory.
In fact, if we were designing the kobject API from scratch, I'd suggest 
making the ktype value an argument to kobject_init() so that it 
_couldn't_ be omitted.

I don't understand the question.  People _already_ expect the cleanup 
routine to free the kobject when the last reference is dropped.  Why 
should there be any confusion over this?
