Note that Arnd's "extra-anal check" added a XXX_BAD() define after all, 
and I ended up accepting that one, because it had a totally valid usage: 
it fixed a real issue not with bad type passing, but with passing types 
that are too _big_. 
I fixed two cases that I found where this was the case, there might be
others (I did a maxconfig, but on SMP. There might be some UP-only driver
that is affected by this).
But I'm too lazy to go back and fix up the older fixes, so..
