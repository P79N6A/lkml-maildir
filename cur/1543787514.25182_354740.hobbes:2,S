Hi there,
 Traced a panicing kernel to what appears the starfire changes for
2.6.13 up to 2.6.14_rc2
During a relative heavy NFS read (client a 32bit 2.6.13.1 P2-350) with
rsync (ripped CD archive) I get kernel panics (Aieee interupt handler
lost or something... okay also need
a way to capture those errors as it's a hard panic and needs a reset button :()
I've isolated the problem going from 2.6.12.5/2.6.12-gentoo-r10 (both
working) to
2.6.13/2.6.13-gentoo/2.6.14_rc2 while the NFS is served through the
Adaptec/starfire,
and further more the onboard forceth(nvidia) is serving the data
without hassles (at least
on 2.6.14_rc2)
Using gcc 3.4.4
