Didn't I already submit this patch?  (Checks...)  Yes, I did, and it's 
already in the tree:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=19272684b8e2fff39941e4c044d26ad349dd1a69
Ben, did you get it from me or was it submitted to you separately?  Just 
curious because I wasn't in the signed-off-by line...  Anyway, it should 
work for you now hopefully.
