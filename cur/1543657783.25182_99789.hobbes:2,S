Any chance that you can remove this (existing) restriction. It'd be good to be 
able to use this in some networking code (eg netif_carrier_[off|on]() ), but 
that might be in interrupt context.
It may be just a matter of duplicating the arguments, but I really know SFA 
about this stuff, and am loath to touch it least it turn to mush in my 
fingers.
