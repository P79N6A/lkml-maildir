Subject: output of printk can NOT be found in /var/log/messages

I am debugging a module like below. I can get the
printk output in
/var/log/messages when i insmod and rmmmod. But when i
try to open or
ioctl the device, the output of printk doesn't appear
in
/var/log/messages.
What did i do wrong?
I also dumped /proc/sys/kernel/printk and
/etc/syslog.conf. But, i
don't think i had any configuration wrong.
Thanks ahead!
Shu
