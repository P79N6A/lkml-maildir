nope. The goal is to satisfy runnable processes in the range of NR_CPUS.
You are playing word games by suggesting that the current behavior prefers
'low end'. 'thousands of runnable processes' is not 'high end' at all,
it's 'broken end'. Thousands of runnable processes are the sign of a
broken application design, and 'fixing' the scheduler to perform better in
that case is just fixing the symptom. [changing the scheduler to perform
better in such situations is possible too, but all solutions proposed so
far had strings attached.]
