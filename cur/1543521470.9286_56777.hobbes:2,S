       It's close enough for sampling error.
       The real top seems to do better for figuring actual cpu
       percentage that the procps one does (at least it does for me --
       if I lean on the spacebar for long enough the wcpu rolls up to
       ~30% [at which point I stopped waiting;  it was taking 30 seconds
       to increase .01% of processor and I wanted to finish this
       message].)   Top with s=0 does end up taking all of the
       processor, and much of that in the kernel, but that's several
       hundred refreshes a second, which doesn't seem to be particularly
       useful for anything other than eating up those idle percentages.

       david parsons \bi/ top s=0 ends up slowing down mastodon rebuilds by
                      \/                                     about 50%, too.
