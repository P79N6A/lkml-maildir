My bad. I have an abit motherboard and in doubt I selected the driver
(and then leaved selected since all worked on previous kernels). I've
disabled them and the problem persist.

:) Right, sorry. Now it is.

My reply refers to your list of drivers that require a certain version
of lm-sensors.

Sure. On 2.6.21.1:

while on 2.6.22-rc1:

In both kernels I have set:

      <M> I2C PCF 8584 interfaces
      <M> I2C PCA 9564 interfaces

The diff is empty.
