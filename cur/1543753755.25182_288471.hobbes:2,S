/me curses possible BIOS crap ...
radeonfb tries to restore initial mode when the module is closed, which
wouldn't work for a VGA text thing in fact... I suspect something cause
driver remove() routines to be called on reboot, can you confirm ? Or is
it a module that gets removed ? It may well be a problem that has always
been there (regardless of the radeon driver version) and just triggered
by something the kernel does on reboot...
Ben.
