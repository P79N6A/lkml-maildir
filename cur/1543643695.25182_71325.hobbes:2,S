This is just the breakage that newer gcc's provoke when you try to use
__FUNCTION__ as a string constant.  Easy fix (included at end of message,
Linus please apply)

I'm sort of the maintainer, if there is one at all.  Werner handed me the
torch a year and a half ago since he has other projects and I was one of
the few people still hacking on the core ATM code.  At the time I was doing
some related work so it fit naturally.  Unfortunately, I'm not working
in that field at the moment and my other commitments are taking about 110%
of my time.  I've been trying to keep it sort of maintained in the meantime
(keeping it compiling, basic mailing list admin) but sadly that's been about
it from me lately.  :-(
