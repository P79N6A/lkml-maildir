The structure's already there.  The biggest problem is the amount of
shere work there is to fix all the bloody architectures and drivers
which make use of random crap from asm/serial.h and friends.
I feel very much like I'm working on serial all by myself, especially
when asking arch people to do things results in silence.
So shrug - I've put in the ground work.  ARM's up to date in so much
as it doesn't use asm/serial.h at all anymore.  The other architectures
now need to follow suit.
