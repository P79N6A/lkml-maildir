Thanks for testing, how about this new patch at the end of this email?
Does it make the problem go away?
Alexey, most solid report is that 2.5.43-bk1 makes bug appear.
This is good because it sort of narrows things down.  What is
contained there in networking is:
1) initial stackable dst logic, should not cause problems
2) addition of UDP sendfile and ip_append_*() logic
3) fix to tcp_check_req() "fix" :-)  it only changes bahevior
   on connect so should not be a problem
I heavily, therefore, suspect #2 which is why I am poking around
in the tcp.c changes to change checksumming and copying semantics.
