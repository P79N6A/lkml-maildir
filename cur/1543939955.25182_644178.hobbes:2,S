I'm sending printing jobs to a network printer (it's actually printing
to the localhost simply creating a file), and running this on
Linux-2.6.24 will cause the printing to slow down to 1 print every 3
seconds after printing 500 times.
No such symptoms on 2.6.23.12, or 2.6.20.21.
It's repeatable.
I'm just check if this is already reported/resolved before bisecting the kernel.
Thanks,
Jeff.
