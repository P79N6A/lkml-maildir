Subject: [PATCH] r8169 backport for 2.4.x

It took a bit longer than expected but the backport of the r8169 driver
has been updated for kernel 2.4.29.
Noticeable changes since 12/2004:
- better handling of PHY as found on Acer Aspire 1524WLMi (Richard Dawe);
- fix a bug triggered when the device is brought down then up again;
- avoid a few lost/screaming interrupts;
- closed a race when a change of mtu is issued during network activity;
- fix VLAN on big-endian hosts;
- merge relevant changes from Realtek's 2.2 driver;
- ethtool stats (Stephen Hemminger);
- ethtool msglevel support (Stephen Hemminger);
- fix Rx descriptors f*ckup [*];
- fix incoming frame length check [*].
There are probably some bits of Jon Mason as well but I'm too lazy to
check and the whole detail is available in the patch-script directory.
If your r8169 device will never receive oversized frames nor can it 
experience a really high packet per second stream (count 50kpps as low),
the items marked [*] make no difference. If the adapter is on a public
lan and/or it does not use the default 1500 MTU, you almost surely want
these.
If it worked for you before, you should not notice anything.
