The kernel's x86 format is:
        printk("EIP: %04x:[<%08lx>] CPU: %d\n",0xffff & regs->xcs,regs->eip, smp_processor_id());
        print_symbol("EIP is at %s\n", regs->eip);
so what you have there is the first EIP: line.  The "EIP is at
symbol+0xN/0xM" is produced by the print_symbol statement, which
ksymoops decided to omit from the output.
It can be clearly seen from the rest of the oops (the call trace)
that print_symbol definitely does produce output, so kallsyms hasn't
been disabled.

I have been wondering why we still mark the addresses with [< >]
even though we've decoded them ourselves.  Maybe omitting these
would be sufficient in the kallsyms-decoded case?
