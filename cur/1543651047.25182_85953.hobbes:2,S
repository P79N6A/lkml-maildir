  The thing is that Solaris, AIX, and ISC are written by commercial
companies, they realize that customers need to be able to debug systems
which don't have a screen, a serial printer, etc. They do have disk. 
  I was hoping Alan would push Redhat to put this in their Linux so we
could resolve some of the ongoing problems which don't write an oops to a
log, but I guess none of the developers has to actually support production
servers and find out why they crash.
