From: (Eric W. Biederman)
Subject: [PATCH] exec: Cleanup exec from a non thread group leader.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/29/10

This patch modifies switch_exec_pids so that it uses the
normal attach_pid/detach_pid functions.  This makes
the code more maintainable and it removes a race
where find_pid could fail to find a thread group or
a process id that currently exists.
We also now preserve the exit_signal of our thread group
leader when we call exec (when we take over the thread
group leaders identity).
And for good measure we set the thread group leaders
exit_signal to -1 so it will self reap.  We are actually
past the point where that matters but it can't hurt, and
it might help someday.
