Ho-hum.  Please at least compile-test non-trivial patches with
CONFIG_SMP=n, especially when they dink with bitmasks, bitmaps and
SMP-specific features.
init/main.c: In function `fixup_cpu_present_map':
init/main.c:636: warning: use of compound expressions as lvalues is deprecated
init/main.c:636: error: invalid lvalue in assignment
Due to:
			cpu_set(i, cpu_present_map);
It appears that cpu_set() is simply broken on UP:
#define	cpu_present_map			cpumask_of_cpu(0)
#define cpumask_of_cpu(cpu)		({ ((cpumask_t)1) << (cpu); })
#define cpu_set(cpu, map)		do { (void)(cpu); cpus_coerce(map) = 1UL; } while (0)
Put those things together and there's no way it can work.  It's not even
conceptually right: cpu_present_map is a "constant" on UP and we have no
business trying to modify it.  So perhaps a build error is the appropriate
response.
I'll stick a CONFIG_SMP in the caller, let the bitmap beavers worry about
the more general details.
