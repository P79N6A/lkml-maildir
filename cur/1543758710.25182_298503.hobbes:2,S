In some cases, yes, it it desirable.  For example, lib/extable.c provides a
default implementation of an exception table sorter but if the architecture
defies its own, the linker will skip the default version in lib/.
At least, that's what the thinking was a few years ago.  But it's such a
special-case that we can probably forget about it and just drive the build
and linkage with config now.

It does, but that reference is within the same compilation unit as the
definition.  IOW: there are no references to the symbol which are external
to the symbol's file.   There's still nothing to drag that file in.
