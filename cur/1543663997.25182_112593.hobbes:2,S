I'm glad you tackled that. I was going to write a response, but
backed off because I'm getting meek in my old age. I do wish to
add that, even in ix86 assembly language, indexing by using a
register and a memory oprand is a signed displacement, i.e,
here:	.byte	0
foo:	.byte	0
        movl	$0xffffffff, %ebx
	movl	foo,(%ebx), %eax
... accesses a memory location one byte before label foo, i.e.,
foo[-1] or here[0].  This means that with a N-bit addressing,
indexed addressing cannot access more than 2^(N-1) memory locations.
Something to consider when trying to access large arrays. For
instance, if an operating system were to allow flat-mode access from
0x00000000 to 0xffffffff memory addresses in 32-bit user-mode, could
you actually use all that address space in 'C'?
