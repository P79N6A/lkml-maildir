After some testing I discovered that its a bug with the XFree86 4.X
servers with the patch I sent in to fix the console palette bug. I tested
2.4.0-test4 with SVGA and Fbdev 3.3.6 X servers. No problems at all. This 
is with both fbcon and vgacon. I attempted to test 4.X but have yet to get
to actually work at all. Their are reasons why I don't run XFree86 X
servers but due to bug reports I had to find out the problem. A bad
mistake.  
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
