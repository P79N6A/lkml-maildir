Have you thought about using mmap and raw-io?
* the kernel driver allocates a fifo (probably a ring?) buffer. The
driver implement mmap.
* the user space daemon mmaps the complete ring buffer.
* The user space daemon waits until the next block is written to the
ring, then it uses /dev/raw?? to write the data to the disk.

0-memcopy, direct DSP DMA->main memory; main memory->SCSI DMA :-)
mmap is always possible, raw-io needs one dedicated partition and I'm
not sure if it's supported in stock 2.2.18 (but there are add-on patches
for 2.2)

You could also replace the user space daemon with a kernel_thread(), but
I doubt that this will be necessary.
