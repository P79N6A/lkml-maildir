	In 2.5.20, ll_rw_kio could submit bio's that are too
big for the underlying queue to handle (they might have more
sectors than q->max_sectors, more iovec's than q->max_phys_segments
or q->max_hw_segments).
	As a hypothetical example, suppose that ll_rw_kio is
called to copy 148kB of data (37 4kB pages on x86) to a Compaq
Smart2 raid controller.  Assume also that the pages are not
contiguous in physical memory and there is no iommu to make them
look contiguous to a DMA device, so there will be no merging.
	In this example, ll_rw_kio in linux-2.5.20 would handle this
call by building a single bio with 37 iovec's and pass it in a single
call to submit_bio.  Nothing in the request merging code in
drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c will break up this bio.  blk_recount_segments
will fill in bio->bi_phys_segments and bio->bi_hw_segments as 37
(because there is no merging to make it any smaller).
blk_recalc_rq_segments will then set rq->nr_phys_segments to 37
(the request will contain only this one bio, becasue bio->bi_phys_segments
already excceds q->max_phys_segments).
	Eventually, do_cciss_request (in drivers/block/cciss.c) will
extract the request containing the bio with bio->bi_phys_segments == 37.
request and generate a kernel panic because the number of segements
exceeds 32.  In the case of linux-2.5.20/drivers/block/cciss.c, this
happens around line 1799:
        creq = elv_next_request(q);
        if (creq->nr_phys_segments > MAXSGENTRIES)
                BUG();
