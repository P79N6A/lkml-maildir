I have a second parport installed as a PCI-card. In earlier Linux-versions
this would lock the machine completely if parport & Co where compiled as
modules (2.2.16 and 2.2.17). Compiled into the kernel however, everything
worked fine. I wrote about that to LK, but no solution was found. Now in
2.2.18 it is the other way round, modules work with the proper
initialization in modules.conf, but if compiled into the kernel, the
second parport vanishes completely.
lspci -v gives:
00:0d.0 Parallel controller: Timedia Technology Co Ltd: Unknown device
7268 (rev 01) (prog-if 02 [ECP])
        Subsystem: Timedia Technology Co Ltd: Unknown device 0103
        Flags: stepping, medium devsel, IRQ 9
        I/O ports at 9000
        I/O ports at 8800
/proc/parport however only knows about parport0
As I prefer the parport being modularized, it´s no problem for me. But
IMHO the other way it should work, too.
Cheers
