Even after fixing the 4 wrapped lines in the patch, I'm not going in 
cleanly here:
patching file drivers/ide/ide-dma.c
Hunk #1 FAILED at 681.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file 
drivers/ide/ide-dma.c.rej
The first 'grep' line of the patch is found at an offset of about +180 
lines in the original file.
The rest of it seems to have found a home, but at offsets in excess of 
159 lines for a few of them.
This was against a 2.6.9 tree, and 2.6.9-mm1 failed in similar 
fashion.  What src tree is this to be applied to?
