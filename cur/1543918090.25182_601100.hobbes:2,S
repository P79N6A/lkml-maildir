I think you can do it already, without us complicating mremap further
with such a start search hint.
First call mmap with a low hint address, the new size you'll be wanting
from the mremap, PROT_NONE, MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0.  Then call mremap with
old address, old size, new size, MREMAP_MAYMOVE|MREMAP_FIXED, and new
address as returned by the preparatory mmap.
