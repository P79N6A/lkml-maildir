Ok, are some luck. I panic()ed on freezer fail and checked
the stacktrace of the unfrozen tasks. The stacktrace of each one looks
like:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PID: 7697   TASK: cc354a70  CPU: 7   COMMAND: "make"
#0 [cc37fe50] schedule at c0431752

Rafael had sent out a patch to fix the vfork race, which can be found at
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/1/212
However, the following hunk seems to be missing from the latest -mm.
@@ -1393,7 +1394,9 @@ long do_fork(unsigned long clone_flags,
		tracehook_report_clone_complete(clone_flags, nr, p);
		if (clone_flags & CLONE_VFORK) {
+			freezer_do_not_count();
			wait_for_completion(&vfork);
+			freezer_count();
			tracehook_report_vfork_done(p, nr);
		}
		} else {
Rafael / Andrew,
        Any reasons for leaving this hunk out?
I reran my tests with this hunk applied, and it work just fine.
Even 'make -j' the maximum time taken to hotplug a cpu was 0m2.16s.
