Hi all,
I just made an interesting finding and would like to have comments from 
NVidia:
Chip   Current Value   New Value
C17       1F0FFF01     1F01FF01
C18D      9F0FFF01     9F01FF01
In fact I have the newer chip revision (lspci says c1), but due to a 
post at Abit Forums I tried to use the value for the older revision on 
my board, and guess what: I never had such low idle temps! I am 
currently even using nvidia binary graphics driver and usually I would 
be having around 49-51°C idle temp, but now it is around 45°C, and it 
was not the first boot (then the mobo usually shows 5°C less). Instead 
the temp steadily fell from >50°C to 45°C.
(esp @nvidia:) Is there anything evil using the old chip's value for the 
new chip? So far I haven't noticed any bad thing about it. Perhaps some 
daring nforce2 user with the new revision should try as well.
bye,
Prakash
