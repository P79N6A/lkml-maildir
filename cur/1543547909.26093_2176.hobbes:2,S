Hi,
Just installed linux-2.4.0-test7, but I noticed that the modules get
installed
	/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/...
which is different from previous kernels.  Do I need to modify modules
path in conf.modules in order that the modules can be found during
boot?  or is there an updated modutils that'll search that path?
Thanks
Andrew Park
