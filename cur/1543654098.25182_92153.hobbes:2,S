  I think that as a point of comparison it has value. That is
one of the reasons that these are automatically run on STP.

  However it would be nice to see the code updated for a
different environment that the assumed VAX 11/780. As
that was the original baseline for the test.  Block sizes,
and maybe things like making fakeh.tar to something like
the 2.4.19 kernel.  This has been discussed a couple of
times I think that it will just take some body to lead
it. If you need equipment to test this on larger machines
we have some available.
