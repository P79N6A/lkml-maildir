Then I guess you have a problem. We try and fix up BIOS problems but there
is a limit to what we can do, and if it has problems like the one that is
logged I'd be worried what else it might do - eg I suspect Nvidia 4x AGP cards
aren't too solid on it.
The APIC errors also suggest something isn't happy at all at the hardware
layer. Are you using MP processors ?
