I'm going to be off-line for a couple of days, so I just reverted it.

commit b5bf28cde894b3bb3bd25c13a7647020562f9ea0
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@woody.linux-foundation.org>

    Revert "e1000: fix shared interrupt warning message"
    
    This reverts commit d2ed16356ff4fb9de23fbc5e5d582ce580390106.
    
    As Thomas Gleixner reports:
      "e1000 is not working anymore. ifup fails permanentely.
        ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): eth0: link is not ready
       nothing else"
    
    The broken commit was identified with "git bisect".
    
    Auke Kok says:
      "I think we need to drop this now.  The report that says that this
       *fixes* something might have been on regular interrupts only.  I
       currently suspect that it breaks all MSI interrupts, which would make
       sense if I look a the code.  Very bad indeed."
