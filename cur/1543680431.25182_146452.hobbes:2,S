I've said it before on this list, and on the linux-usb-devel list, but
here it is again for people to refer to in the future.
The locking and reference counting logic changes in the usb-serial
drivers needs to be backported to the 2.4 kernel to fix this problem.
The changes were spread out over a wide range of time during the 2.5
development process, so I can't point to a single changeset, sorry.  It
also requires changing all usb-serial drivers to do this properly.
If you do a diff of the two trees, you should see the major changes.
Good luck,
