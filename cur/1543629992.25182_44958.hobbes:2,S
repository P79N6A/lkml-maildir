Seems to have the same problems. The following seems to work nicely for me:

Btw, please also do a s/ibmnumaq/numaq/.  Everyone actually reading
the code should know it's from IBM and given that the design actually
originated at Sequent..

For i386, yes.  It looks to me (please correct me that I'm wrong), that
the ifdefs in bootmem.h are to allow architecture-specific versions
of the *_node functions.  This could also be needed by other architectures
and really isn't a config options.  I think because of this such a
feature-define looks more apropinquate to me then a CONFIG_ option.
