I think controlling I/O bandwidth is right way to go.
However, I think you need to change the design of the controller a bit.
A lot of I/O requests processes issue will be handled by other contexts.
There are AIO, journaling, pdflush and vmscan, which some kernel threads
treat instead of the processes.
The current design looks not to care about this.
Thanks,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
