I'm still not sure there's an issue with it.
But.. what I did find was that somewhere along the way
the nr_sectors field became an "unsigned long"
so the test for "if ((rq->nr_sectors -= nsect) <= 0)"
doesn't work anymore.  A patch to fix it is attached,
which a couple of folks out there are now testing.
That explains a lot, and the code really ought to be fine
with just this patch.. we need to hear back from everyone
who saw problems, though.
Cheers
