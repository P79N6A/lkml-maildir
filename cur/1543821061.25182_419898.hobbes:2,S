Yes, I think your analysis seems correct. There is an advantages
to calling sched_info_switch() before checking for prev != next in
the if (likely()).
if prev == next, sched_info_switch() updates the task and runqueue statistics
information (that helps keeping it up to date). This might be useful
for SCHED_FIFO.
