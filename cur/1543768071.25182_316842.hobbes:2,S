While your swap-sched allows tasks waiting on other tasks to run better, it 
also introduces a greater degree of unfairness in cpu resource sharing. By 
allowing the dependent tasks to stay on the runqueue you increase 
substantially their share of the resources they would otherwise have gotten. 
The whole point of decrementing priority and runqueue expiration is to 
maintain fairness and you're introducing another way to delay that system 
from working. process_load is not the ideal task to test this unfairness on 
this design but even that shows twice as much cpu usage with your own tests. 
How do you propose to ensure we maintain fairness in this model ?
