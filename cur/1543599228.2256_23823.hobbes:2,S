There may be a configuration problem. Make sure that you do:
make oldconfig
make dep
make clean
make bzImage
make modules
make modules_install
... after you set the SMP variable. A mixture of SMP and non-SMP
code can cause hangs.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
