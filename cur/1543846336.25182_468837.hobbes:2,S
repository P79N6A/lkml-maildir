Where as I said, removing the "regs &&" should be just fine.
(Is the plan that David Howells re-issue that patch?  If so, I'l
expect e will just fix it that way...)

Questionable in what way?  When that code is called to clean up
after driver death, that loop must be ignored ... every pending I/O
can safely be scrubbed.  That's the main point of that particular
HC_IS_RUNNING() test.  In other cases, it's essential not to touch
DMA queue entries that the host controller is still using.
