I originally put it where it is to be near prio and static_prio which 
are referenced at the same time as it BUT that doesn't happen often 
enough to justify it anymore so I guess it can be moved.

The idea (for the change from the earlier model) was to actually give 
equal weight to negative and positive nices.  Under the old (purely 
linear) model a nice=19 task has 1/20th the weight of a nice==0 task but 
a nice==-20 task only has twice the weight of a nice==0 so that system 
is heavily weighted against negative nices.  With this new mapping a 
nice=19 has 1/20th and a nice==-19 has 20 times the weight of a nice==0 
task and to me that is symmetric.  Does that make sense to you?
Should I add a comment to explain the mapping?

Interesting idea.  I'll look at this more closely.
