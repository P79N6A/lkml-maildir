Sorry, I meant kmem_cache_reap. It was the call into there from
vmscan.c which was the problem.  On my 4-way (which is fairly
immune to lock contention for some reason), I was seeing *25%*
contention on the spinlock inside the cache_chain_sem semaphore.
With, of course, tons of context switching going on.
And it was giving a sort of turnstile effect, where each CPU needed
to pass through kmem_cache_reap before entering page reclaim proper.
Which maybe wasn't so bad in the 2.4 setup.  But in 2.5 the VM is
basically per-zone, so different CPUs can run reclaim against different
zones with no contention of any form.  This is especially important on
NUMA.
But the above could have been solved in different ways, and there are
still global effects with the requirement to prune slab.  I expect that
the batching and perhaps a per-slab exclusion mechanism will fix up
any remaining problems.

That is the effect of per-cpu hotlist within the page allocator
on a 16- or 32-way NUMAQ.
It shows some of the benefit which we can get by carefully recycling
known-to-be-hot pages back into places where the page is known to
soon be touched by this CPU.  Most of the gains were in do_anonymous_page,
copy_foo_user(), zap_pte_range(), etc.  Where you'd expect.
I expect to end up with two forms of page allocation and freeing:
alloc_hot_page/alloc_cold_page and free_hot_page/free_cold_page

Was the microbenchmark actually touching the memory which it was
allocating from slab?  If so then yes, we'd expect to see cache
misses against those cold pages coming out of the buddy.

I'd suggest that we wait until we have slab freeing its pages into
the hotlists, and allocating from them.  That should pull things back.
