And you're not varying the client at all, you're only changing the
kernel version on the server?
There are literally no commits between v2.6.24-rc3 and v2.6.24-rc4 which
touch fs/nfsd/.  What filesystem are you exporting?  Are the nfs-utils
versions the same in both cases?
Also, could you get a network trace showing the failure?
