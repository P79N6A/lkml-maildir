Yup.  I was suggesting remmoval of the `inline' keyword, rather than
actually moving the bodies of those functions into the caller.
I've previously seen significant code size reductions by _not_ inlining
large functions which had a single call site - just leave them as normal
out-of-line functions.  So it worth experimenting with - pretty simple to
do.  But if you're using a recent gcc it's probably inlining the function
even when it's not marked inline.   Whatever.
