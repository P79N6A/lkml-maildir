It works. Subjectively I have relatively long pause after first Suspending console
message (where it hangs otherwise), according to dmesg timestamp it is about
1 second before next messages appear. Also last two times I tried it writeout
of suspend image was really slow; it was both with and without battery. Reading
on resume in really in order of magnitude faster.
But manual STD so far works both on AC (with or without battery) or on battery.
Of course it is possible that battery gets exhausted during STD, but system
is not switched off. Rather I would suspect something like ACPI notification
that comes during freeze ...
If someone can advice which options to enable I could try netconsole. But likely
not before next weekend.
