I'd not really pondered people who compile many drivers into their kernel
instead of into the initrd. I guess a few people still do that.
As to the messages, if you are in graphical mode then you are right, the
messages could be supressed and sent via user space but not directly. I
guess the other way then is to use a custom font, set the configuration to
not leave gaps between characters and draw a boot graphical view in that
font ?
