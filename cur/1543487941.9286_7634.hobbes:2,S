It is a continuous buffer. I find it curious that you use ifnet as a synonym
for BSD.

data_skb points to the original skb for cloned skbs. 
count it is the reference count of the data portion
users is how many users the skbuff header has.
[BTW in 2.2 data_skb is gone and a reference count is kept at the end of
 the data]

skb_clone(). It only duplicates the skbuff header, but not the packet data.
