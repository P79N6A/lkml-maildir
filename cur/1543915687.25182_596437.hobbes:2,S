What's the situation on unprivileged mounts?  iirc, it's all a bit stuck.
If unpriv-mounts code isn't going to go into mainline ahead of r/o bind
mounts then it'd make a big mess to prepare the r/o bind mount patches on
top of unprivileged mounts.
It sounds like a better approach would be for me to merge the r/o bind
mounts code and to drop (or maybe rework) the unprivileged mounts patches
