Thanks for enlightening me on previous discussions.  The interface in
the "gpiolib" patch is along the lines of what I'm looking for.
However, I still feel this approach is backwards.  Going from a
'struct gpio' to an 'int gpio' is easy.  Attempting to go from an 'int
gpio' to a 'struct gpio' is hard, as the code you provide
demonstrates.
Can you help explain what the gain to using an integer over a 'struct
gpio' is?  I can't help but feel that fundamentally gpios are not
integers and that it is a mistake to code an API around that concept.

I agree that the code you provide is a big step up from the existing
code.  We also both seem to agree that more than just an arch
abstraction is necessary (the cansleep stuff seems to be an
acknowledgment of this).
However, I don't understand the downside to making the API sane from
the start and avoiding the artificial integer namespace problems.

Once many of the problems are fixed, I fear fixing the remaining will
be a harder sell.  Due to the difficulty of implementing kernel wide
APIs, I suspect some maintainers will just stick to cramming features
in the arch directory (as your patch encourages) which can lead to
duplicated code and fragmented implementations.
Thanks for working on this.
