That's possible with the presented interface[1]:
	# see if event is supported
	cat $path/evt_media_change
	# turn off event to deal with broken/beserk devices
	echo 0 > $path/evt_media_change
Some sillyhead can always do
	echo 1 > $path/evt_some_event_my_device_does_not_support
but that will be obviously be a no-op because their device simply will 
not send such events.
Granted ls(1) is no longer a method for viewing supported-at-boot-time 
list of events -- ls(1) in the presented interface lists what events the 
_kernel_ supports, and cat(1) is used to discover which events are 
actually enabled.
I think that is the only difference between our two positions:  [if I 
understand you correctly] you want ls(1) to be able to list the device's 
supported events.  However, I feel that is inconsistent:  for your 
proposal, userspace must perform two checks in order to determine a 
feature's availability: 1) does the file exist? 2) is the file context 
non-zero?
