Oh Rick, everyone is always so serious -- lighten up -- it's just open
debate.  Al is pretty hateful at times, and I realize he has strong
views -- but everyone's views are different -- that's the great thing
about an open forum like this -- people can get offended -- people can
agree -- people can disagree -- and we can FIX ALL OUR BUGS.  It's also
quite healthy to give people a good kick in the duff from time to time
-- it gets them thinking, and if being mad at me polarizes folks and
makes them more effective, so be it.  
I hope you guys can just take it in stride and carry on.  Its not a
serious game where an end comes, we just keep moving forward.  Also,
your partisan side is showing.....
Your friend,
Jeff
