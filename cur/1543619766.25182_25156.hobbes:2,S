If you are correct, then there a fundamental design problem with my
Linux Booting Linux code.  Because that is exactly what I do.  I stuff
the kernel in memory and jump to it.  Once the new kernel starts there is
no back and forth.  _Please_ help me understand why this back and
forth is needed.  
Here is my experience.  Non-interactive etherboot, doesn't know what
it is booting, or where it is booting from until the DHCP server tells
it.  Then it gets a file from a TFTP server and boots that.
When booting the Linux kernel it never attempts to do a back and forth
via the firmware to the boot medium.  Instead someone has a clue about
what the boot medium was and it mounts that medium using it's own
drivers.  Booting a rescue cd is a good example.
_Please_ help me find the flaw in my understanding.
