Then it starts to depend on what kind of transactions you want to
implement.
You can say that a transaction isn't allowed when a process has one of
the files opened for writing.  Or you can say a transaction is
equivalent to calling all of the I/O system calls at once.  You can
also decide if you want the reads and directory lookups performed in
the transactions to become prerequisites for the transaction
completing (so it's aborted if another process writes to those file
regions or changes the directory structure in a way which breaks a
prerequisite), or if you want those to lock the things which are read
for the duration of the transaction, or even just ignore reads for
transaction purposes.  Or, you can say that transactions are limited
to just directory structure, and not file contents (that's good enough
for package management), or you can say they're limited to just file
contents (that's good enough for databases and text file edits).
Etc, etc, quite a lot of semantic choices.

It's even harder without kernel support! :)
