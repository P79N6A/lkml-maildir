Sorry, but I don't understand that argument. Drivers that only support
a single device can easily do static allocation. Drivers with potentially
multiple watchdogs can just do the allocation themselves with no
more complexity than calling alloc_watchdogdev. The advantage is that
you don't need to deal with magic pointers if you just embed the
struct watchdog_device in the drivers structure, like:
struct softdog_device {
	struct timer_list ticktock;
	struct watchdog_device dev;
};
#define to_softdog(wd) container_of((wd), struct softdog_device, dev)
static int softdog_keepalive(struct watchdog_device *wd_dev)
{
	struct softdog_private *softdog_info = to_softdog(wd_dev);
	/* ... */
}
static int softdog_init(void)
{
	struct softdog_device *sd;
	sd = kmalloc(sizeof(*sd), GFP_KERNEL);
	/* ... /*
	return register_watchdogdevice(&sd->dev);
}

ok.

If you want to allow unloading the device driver, you need to
prevent it from being unloaded while another thread is using it.
E.g. you might be in the middle of the keepalive function while
the function code is released from memory.

What I meant is that watchdog_open() would simply return -ENODEV
when no watchdog is registered, which looks to the application
just like no it does when the misc device is not registered.
You can even do request_module("watchdog") in watchdog_open()
do autoload the low-level driver.
BTW: with the current approach, the daemon won't be able to open
the device at all if you are using udev, so module autoload is
not possible either.

Ok. While this could of course be hidden in the device driver
by keeping a private state in order to reduce interface complexity,
You're probably right that reducing implementation complexity
gains more here.

ok.
