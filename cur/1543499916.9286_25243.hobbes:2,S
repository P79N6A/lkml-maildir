Folks,
	I have a couple of questions that I hope someone can answer.  I'm currently
running 2.2.10 with Alan's ac2 patch, and I am currently seeing the following
strange behavior.
	1) Not long after booting the system I see the following message:
		VFS: file-max limit 4096 reached.
	   At various points in time after I have booted I will get errors because
	   of too many open files.  I find it hard to believe that within a few
	   hours of booting I have over 4000 files open.
	2) When I start up pppd to dial my ISP I get several of the following
	   message appear.
		Unable to load interpreter
	   It doesn't seem to cause any problems, but I would like to know what
	   is causing it.  I will anywhere from 4 or 5 of these messages to over
	   a dozen.  I'm running pppd 2.3.8.
Any assitance is appreciated.
My system is a 2P 350Mhz Pentium II.  Further info can be provided on request.
Paolo
