Yes it is. In fact, it is more of a problem then you think.
Think of this simple scenario:
a script is running that downloads a kernel patch, applies it to a tree,
then renames the directory to $1-$patchname.
Half way through this, during the patch, the backup script comes through
and starts to backup the filesystem.
Now - wipe the drive clean at the end and restore it to a sane state.
Doing live things on storage systems without transactions, snapshots or
whatever you want to call them is tricky at best. resizing is going to 
cause headaches.
