Subject: parse-boot-parameter-error.patch breaks UML
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/22/178

From the changelog:
	Say a boot parameter is "xxx", if you give a string "xxxy", then the
	boot parameter's corresponding function is executed.
UML has parameters such as "ubda=<filename>" which are matched by
__setup("ubd", ubd_setup), which hits the "error" case this patch now
outlaws.
