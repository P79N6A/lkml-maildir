Applied. 
Just a non-technical note: the sign-offs makes me suspect the patch (or an 
earlier version of it) may have been written by Kurosawa-san. However, it 
wasn't clear, so I didn't make that change, and so it now ends up being in 
git with Paul as the author.
If that was wrong, please for the future keep authorship intact by having 
a "From: A U Thor <author@mailbox.com>" at the head of the description, 
which will make authorship clear and allow the tools to pick that up.
