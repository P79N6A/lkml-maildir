It sounds kind of like your looking for a protocol like SCTP.  SCTP is a bit
like a hybrid between TCP and UDP.  It provides for both a stream oriented
transport, and a sequential packet transport, which is like UDP, but with
sequence numbers that are visibile to the user space app, so in order delivery
can be guaranteed, and application controlled packet loss can be enabled.
