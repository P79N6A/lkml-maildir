It is indeed a security issue. Some interesting non-tin-foil remote
attacks may even be possible, but they're still at the handwaving
stage. It should be fixed and soon, but I'm also aware that 2.6.10 is
imminent.
Unfortunately, the 2.6 development methodology is not well suited to
timely security fixes, unless we get serious about this 2.6.x.y
strategy.
