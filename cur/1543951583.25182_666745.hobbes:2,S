I agree that we ought to be able to (dare I say it?) stack containers
and Smack. I have come around 180 degrees regarding the value of
module stacking and am now convinced that a general mechanism for
it would be a Good Thing. Both SELinux and Smack already provide
for stacking capabilities, and I've been asked by another project to
provide for stacking their module. The alternative to general stacking
looks more and more like each LSM providing for the modules it is
willing to stack with, and that could get painful pretty quickly.
Or, tell me why I'm wrong. I promise to listen nicely. (smiley)
