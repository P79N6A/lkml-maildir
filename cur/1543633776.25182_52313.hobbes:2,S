Although not exactly the same as your experience, I have a dual CPU
AMD machine that locks up when burning CD-RW disks.  The CDRW drive
is an IDE device that is running under SCSI emulation.  When I turn
DMA off on that device (/sbin/hdparm -d 0 /dev/hdc) it works fine
without any panics.
In my case there was no Oops, the system simply locked up tight.
The power button was the only option despite having Ctrl-Alt-Delete in
inittab and putting Alt-Sys-Req in the kernel (2.4.18 and 2.4.19-pre7).
Might be worth a try. . .
Chris
