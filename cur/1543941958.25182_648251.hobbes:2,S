Yes, my crash happens at kernel space, but is due to the randomized
params passed to set_brk (the same thing that makes your game crash
later at runtime).
I did not understand why my kernel was crashing before reading your
comments, but now I think is all happening because of the brk
randomization. Sorry, I will not be able to try disabling
randomization until tomorrow at office in order to confirm you this.
I am trying to figure out what is relation the brk randomization
feature and my crash... but makes sense to me now, trying to find it.
Yours, Abel.
