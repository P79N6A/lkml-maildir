What about instead of breaking application just add new sysfs file,
which will only return temperature instead of full rom content.
It can be millidegrees Centigrade, another one can be millikelvins :)
Actually it is already posible for applications to decode whatever
precision they like from the rom content displayed, although that can be
not very convenient.
