Subject: Problem with mke2fs on huge RAID-partition

Hi there,
I just build a nice little fileserver consisting of 2 40GB-HD's with
some RAID-1 partitions and 6 80 GB-HD's on 3 Promise Ultra 100 TX-Adapters
as a RAID-5 partition.
All RAID is done in software, using (at the moment) a Standard RedHat 7.2
Kernel 2.4.7.
My problem is: If I start mke2fs [1] on the device, it writes everything
down until "Writing Superblocks...". The system then completly hangs.
And yes, I did wait long enough (well, at least I think 15 hours should
be enough ;-)
Is there a limitation in the maximum size of a partition (well, 400 GB is
not that small...), may it be a (known) problem of mke2fs or the particular
Kernel-Version, or does anyone have any suggestions where else to seek?
Thanks in advance
