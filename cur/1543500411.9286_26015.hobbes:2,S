Well after doing a bit of thinking on the topic of a portal fs, and I
recall somebody mentioning a sockfs.  Would there be any interest in
implementing the entire socket namespace symbolicly in a virtual
filesytem?
Say to connect to port 25 of some host 
/sockets/outgoing/ip/tcp/raw/10.0.0.1/25/
Or if you wanted it to do the higher level protocol handling like http or
ftp.
/sockets/outgoing/ip/tcp/http/10.0.0.1/80/someremotefile
and 
/sockets/outgoing/ip/tcp/http/10.0.0.1/21/someremotefile
As for the binding something like
/sockets/incoming/ip/tcp/inaddr-any/25
Then if say the admin of the system only wanted user foo to be able to
bind to a socket you could do something like
chown foo /sockets/incoming/ip/tcp/inaddr-any/80
Then if people really wanted to they could do away with the BSD socket()
API(evil grin ;)  Not that anybody ever would but.....
Any thoughts???
