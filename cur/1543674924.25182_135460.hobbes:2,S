Very few BIOSes set up complete timings. The only ones that you can rely
on to handle this are those that do magic with bios tables such as
serverworks. In the serverworks case we implement the bios timing reading
per their NDA'd documents *regardless* of that setting.
Its only there because Linus applied the change despite my requests not to,
then refused to remove it. The sooner it dies the better
