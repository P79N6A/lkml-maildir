An ISA cards, mostly for data acquisition - edge triggered interrupts,
no ack required immediately from interrupt handler. Rest of hardware
handling can be deferred to user space.
IRQ sharing is possible there in spite of some hardware hacking.
Yes, it is very limited range of hardware today but it exists
and /dev/irq kernel module provide one of generic mechanisms for user
space driver implementation.
