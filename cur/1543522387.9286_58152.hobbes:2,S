Subject: 2.2.10-14 i686 SMP: IDE RAID-5 array hangs on mount

Greetings,
I have a RAID-5 array across 10 GB partitions on four 17 GB IDE drives
at hda-d, and a RAID-0 array across 5 GB partitions on the same drives,
on a dual-Celeron ABIT BP6 motherboard (haven't installed the recent
BIOS upgrade).
I've built SMP kernels from 2.2.10 and 2.2.13 source with gcc-2.95, and
then 2.2.13 and 2.2.14 with gcc-2.7.2.3, all using the standard Debian
.config except 686 and SMP (well, approximately the Debian 2.2.13 config
for 2.2.14).
For all of these kernels, the machine always hangs while mounting the
RAID-5 array.  It never hangs while mounting the RAID-0 array, which
happens to come before it.  And it never hangs under the non-SMP 386
Debian kernel images.
Are there any known races which got into 2.2.14?  I haven't yet tried
2.2.15-pre, is there any reason to believe it might solve the problem?
If not, the time involved in ckraiding is prohibitive- this is a
production server for a very small group, so I can only test about one
new kernel per week...
(Yes, I know it might be slightly faster and more robust to put one
drive on each controller, but I'm not quite brave enough to try to use
the HPT366 controllers just yet, I care about data integrity more than
speed, and these drives aren't anywhere near fast enough to use half the
33 MB/s bandwidth of the controllers, so no real speed loss, right?
hdparm -t says 3.5 MB/s with the Debian 2.2.13 image.)
Please cc replies to me, I'm not on this list.  Thanks in advance for
any help you can provide.
