Perhaps you are using old names and not installed devfsd ?

It's correct. /dev/hda* are GONE for good (you can emulate them with devfsd,
though).

/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part8 to be exact - the same as recent 2.2.X
with devfs so nothing is changed: it was so for last half year at least.

Of course.

Why ? Are yu saying that you can not use /dev/vc/0 ... /dev/vc/8 ??? It works
fine here with both 2.2.x+devfs and 2.2.4-testX ...

You have two choices:
  1. Read devfs FAQ.
  2. Do not use devfs at all.
devfs WAS NOT designed to be drop-in replacement for old /dev . You CAN use
it this way if you'll add devfsd to the system, of course (read devfs FAQ).
