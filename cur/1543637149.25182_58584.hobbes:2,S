I'm trying to install linux to a toshiba libretto l5 (transmeta crusoe
TM5800). 
I have no cd or floppy, I boot over the network with intel pxe bootrom..
DHCP works, after stripping down the kernel to <512k, the kernel loads
too, but I get the following error message: 
AX: 0205
BX: 0200
CX: 0020
DX: 0000.
8000
I tryed with the following configurations:
version: 2.4.18, 2.4.17
toshiba laptop support: on/off
pci access mode: direct/bios/both
cpu: 386/crusoe
everything else turned off except for IDE and ext2
What does the error message mean? What should I do to make it boot.
Please CC to my address too.
