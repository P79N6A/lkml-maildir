Hi all.
I have a system with an Abit AT7 motherboard:  VIA KT333, single Athlon, 
512M RAM, onboard RTL8139 network, USB, USB2, 1394.  *NO* onboard PS/2 
keyboard or mouse ports.
Other:  IDE HD, CD-RW, and DVD.  Radeon 8500DV (will try getting that 
working later :)
I have used the system successfully with 2.4, and have been trying to 
get 2.5 to work.  Until now, I haven't been able to get the USB keyboard 
to work.  It is initialized by the BIOS, and is usable by GRUB for 
selecting boot images.
I finally found the culprit - "Local APIC Support on Uniprocessors" and 
"IO-APIC on uniprocessors".  If both items are enabled, the network 
functions, but USB doesn't work.  If not both are enabled (neither, or 
Local APIC but not IO-APIC), then the USB system works, but the network 
doesn't.  :(
I am not using modules.
these are the only differences in .config:
