Oh I used the wrong term...
Take for example this function from lwn.net:
static void *ct_seq_next(struct seq_file *s, void *v, loff_t *pos)
{
        loff_t *spos = (loff_t *) v;
        *pos = ++(*spos);
        return spos;
}
I mean 'pos' is sometimes increased in ct_seq_next(), and sometimes from
seq_file.c/seq_read(), too. Thus we cannot reliably do this:
        *pos = (*spos) + some_variable_offset;
You are referring to spos as the iterator, are you?
Maybe I'm wrong. I'll dip more into it.
