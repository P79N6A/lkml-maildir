I believe approach to meet all our goals is to have own network memory
allocator, so that each skb could have its payload in the fragments, we
would not suffer from the heavy fragmentation and power-of-two overhead
for the larger MTUs, have a reserve for the OOM condition and generally
do not depend on the main system behaviour.
I will resurrect to some point my network allocator to check how things
go in the modern environment, if no one will beat this idea first :)
