Okay, I left all debugging patches in, disabled all kernel  
debugging .config stuff and gave it a spin with our usual "killer"  
workload (as far as batch systems are repeatable anyway) and so far  
there was not a single glitch or message, so I preliminarily conclude  
that the bug is squashed. The final word will come once my 1800 batch  
jobs are processed and I have my particle physics result ;-)
Ciao,
