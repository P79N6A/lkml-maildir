Error -2 is "No such file or directory".  Maybe it expects the
firmware to be somewhere other than /lib/firmware or your driver and
firmware versions don't match.  Try adding some debug printk()s around
the request_firmware() call in the driver.
If you're using out of tree drivers the error should be reported to
Intel rather than this list.
