It could just be heat buildup in an critical area when under sustained 
heavy load.  It may take a while for enough heat to build up to cause 
problems.  I just recently found one of these.  It would take 4-6 hours 
of heavy intensive processing before an error would happen.  I placed a 
fan pointing at the motherboard chipset and memory to keep them cooler 
and the problem seams to have gone away.
For testing I wrote a script that kept compiling the kernel again and 
agian in a while(true) loop.  Effectively a repeat until crash loop. 
For each compile it saved the stdout/stderr output and diffed it against 
the first run.  Any differnces were flagged for checking latter.
