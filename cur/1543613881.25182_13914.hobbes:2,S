Dan Kegel put it succinctly:

Your original patch is here, and I do remember the post at the time:
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=98114243104171&w=2
This post provides *zero* context.  Ever since, I've been expecting to see 
some explanation of what the goals are, what the design principles are, what 
the historical context is, etc. etc., and that hasn't happened.
I've got a fairly recent version of the patch too, it's a little too long to 
just sit down and read, to reverse-engineer the above information.  What's 
missing here is some kind of writeup like Suparna did for Jens' bio patch 
(hint, hint).  There's no reason why every single person who might be 
interested should have to take the time to reverse-engineer the patch without 
context.
As Linus points out, the active discussion hasn't happened yet.
