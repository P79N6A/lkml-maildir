No they don't.   I really, really, really know this for a fact.  I wrote 
ASM drivers for every early video adapter and ran them all through Lotus 
QA and Software Arts QA.   Personally.  The only delay needed is caused 
by not having dual-ported video frame buffers on the original CGA in 
high res character mode. This caused "snow" when a memory write was done 
concurrently with the read being done by the scanline character 
generator. And that delay was done by waiting for a bit in the I/O port 
space to change.  There was NO reason to do waits between I/O 
instructions.  Produce a spec sheet, or even better a machine.   I may 
have an original PC-XT still lying around in the attic, don't know if I 
can fire it up, but it had such graphics cards.  I also have several 
early high-speed clones that were "overclocked".

Not true.  Again, I can produce machines that don't use 0x80.  Perhaps 
that is because I am many years older than you are, and have been 
writing code for PC compatibles since 1981.  (not a typo - this was 
before the first IBM PC was released to the public).

Show me one line of Windows code written by Microsoft that uses port 
80.  I don't know what app hackers might have done - there was no 
protection, and someone might have copied the BIOS for some reason.

I obviously have not.   Clearly the guys who want this port 80 hack so 
desperately have not either.  That's why we are in this pickle.  (well, 
we only to the extent that I am accepted as having useful input.  I'm 
happy to go if I'm not perceived as being helpful).

There is a long standing set of reports of "hwclock" not working on HP 
dv.000v laptops, where the . stands for 2, 4, 6, and 9.   These are all 
nvidia MCP51 chipset AMD64's.
And if you choose to be such an insulting ****, I may just stop trying 
to be helpful.  I presume that others in the community find my comments 
helpful.
