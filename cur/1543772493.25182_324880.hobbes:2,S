Das Dehnt sich aus.
Even if there is a case of minimal expansion in the overhead on some
architecture, it may justify the effort for a certain class of
applications which require known interrupt response latencies.
The concept model here is, that you will have all interrupts running in
threads, EXCEPT one or more SA_NODELAY real-time IRQs. Those RT-IRQs may
be required to track satellites, manage I/O for a QOS or RF protocol
stack, shut down a SAW, or a variety of RT-related services.
The IRQ-disable-removal allows that the RT-IRQ encounters minimal
delay. 
Often, that IRQ will also wake up a process, and that process may have
some response-time constraints on it, as well.
SO that's one model that is helped by this design.
