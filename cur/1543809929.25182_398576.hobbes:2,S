I myself have been trying to show why it is required.  Unless I am wrong 
about the msdos MBR code passing the CHS partition start values directly 
to int 13 rather than computing them based on the LBA in the MBR and the 
currently reported geometry from the bios, then fdisk does require the 
correct bios geometry to maintain compatibility with msdos/windows.
My original point was that if it is required ( and since it is still in 
the kernel, that seems to be the case ) then at least make sure it is 
_correct_.  Whether it is needed but wrong, or if it is simply not 
needed, then it is silly to keep geometry in the kernel.
