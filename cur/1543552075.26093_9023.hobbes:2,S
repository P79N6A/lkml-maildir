Yeah.  Via audio is scatter-gather, so I had a function via_mmap_chan
which had to walk the scatter-gather list, calling remap_page_range for
each PAGE_SIZE'd dma buffer.
Now with nopage(), the need to walk the scatter-gather list is
completely avoided.  The scatter-gather info is stored as an array, so
finding the physical address for a virtual page is a direct lookup.

Well, I don't know the VM well so I can't say how bad the lack of
VM_LOCK will affect latency, if at all.
I prefer this way because it seems the most clean -- let the system
pagefault if it wants to, we're not really losing the buffer, only a
reference to it.
