Yes.

Sorry for the poor explanation.
I just thought that it wouldn't be bad to allow "each cpuset whose
cpu_exclusive attribute is mark true" to have its clones like the
figure below. In this case, cpu-2 and cpu-3 will be used exclusively
for the clones --- CPUSET 1, 2, and 3 ---.
I guess it seems very similar to one of your ideas except for reusing
cpu_exclusive flag. Do you think reusing the flag is good idea?
