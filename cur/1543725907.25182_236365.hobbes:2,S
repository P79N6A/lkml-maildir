There is a note in include/linux/wait.h that the sleep_on* functions are 
racy and the wait* functions (listed earlier in the same file) should be 
used instead, but there only seems to be replacements for the 
interruptible versions of those sleep_on functions, is there a reason 
why there is not a "wait_event_timeout_uninterruptible" macro to replace 
sleep_on_timeout?
