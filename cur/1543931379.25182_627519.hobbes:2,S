This patch (after I fixed it) keeps on causing trouble: mismatches between
the header file declarations and the actual definitions of the lookup
tables.  This happens as I apply and unapply the patch.
It _shouldn't_ happen, but there would appear to be some missing makefile
rules.  I guess the C files aren't being regenerated when
scripts/pnmtologo.c has been altered, so the C files aren't matching the 
header which this patch alters.
