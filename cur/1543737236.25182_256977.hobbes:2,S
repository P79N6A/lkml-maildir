Subject: [patch 0/5, 2.6.9-rc3] generic irq subsystem, description
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

this is a new release of the generic irq handling subsystem, against
2.6.9-rc3. This snapshot includes new ppc and ppc64 support written and
tested by Christoph Hellwig.
the core bits were reworked quite significantly. Changes:
 - split up kernel/hardirq.c into individual files in kernel/irq/
 - 80-90% of each converted architecture's irq.c file is now eliminated
   by this patch. The most dramatic one is x64's irq.c - a mere 108
   lines remained. The total effect on the 4 architectures covered so
   far: more than 3000 lines of irq.c code removed while kernel/irq/*.c
   remains around 1000 lines of code.
 - more irq.h, interrupt.h, asm/hardirq.h and linux/hardirq.h
   consolidation from Christoph and me.
 - thorough cleanup of the generic irq code.
 - compile-testing of the following architectures: x86, x64, ppc64, ppc, 
   ia64, s390, s390x. The first four were boot-tested as well.
there are 5 patches that will follow in the next 5 mails:
  generic-hardirqs-core.patch
  generic-hardirqs-x86.patch
  generic-hardirqs-x64.patch
  generic-hardirqs-ppc.patch
  generic-hardirqs-ppc64.patch
note that it is still a goal of the patchset to not break the building
of any non-CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQS platform - 3 such platforms were
compile-tested.
comments welcome,
	Ingo
