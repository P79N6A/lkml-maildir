If you don't have any builtin frame buffer device driver and insmod a frame
buffer device driver, the logo code will still try to display the logo (which
is __initdata). This may cause a crash.
Originally (2.1.x, is it that long ago I used a modular frame buffer device
driver?), this didn't happen because initmem_freed (which no longer exists) was
checked. BTW, there's still a comment in drivers/video/console/fbcon.c about
this.
Anyone else who's seeing this? Anyone with an idea how to fix this?
Moving the logo code to userspace is not considered a solution ;-)
Thanks!
