.. and it's stuill just a wrapper.
A fairly thick one, but still...
More importantly, none of the people arguing against this at all even 
reacted to my suggestion for how to fix things *properly* in my original 
email. Which just means that you're apparently not interested in actually 
fixing this, you're just trying to disagree about some interpretation of 
GPLONLY.
In other words: the next person who can't even be bothered to tell what 
symbols are involved and why they haven't asked whether those symbols 
could instead be relaxed, automaticaly will go into my "flamers" filter, 
and just stay there. Then you can complain as much as you like, and I'll 
never see it.
