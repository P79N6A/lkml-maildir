Sent to Linus, assume it will be merged soon.

No. For once the flags to gcc differs for userland and kernelland.
Of the two candidates only kern_constants.h could be dealt with by
the generic support.

And this killed the idea of using the generic support - not a big deal
anyway.

This just shows how horribly broken the symlink scheme is in the first
place.
If the kernel had used a scheme like the following everything could be
solved by a few -I statements:
include/i386/asm/<what we have in include/asm-i386 today>
include/ia64/asm/<what we have in include/asm-ia64 today>
etc.
Then to use ia64 we would just use:
-Iinclude/ia64
And in um land we could do exactly the same with no ugly symlinks.

Here we should do like this:
arch/um/include/<subarch>/sysdep/<files from sysdep-<subarch>>
Again no ugly symlinks needed.
Another benefir that is often overlooked.
With kbuild checking the compileflags everything 'just works' when we
change sub-arch. No need to make clean etc.
I know this is a lot of renaming and I have not seen a really good
argument to convince Linus to rename include/asm-<arch>.
But for um I see no big dela doing the renaming, especially since most
of currect code should work out-of-the-box even with the changes
introduced.
