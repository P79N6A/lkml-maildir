I think the stated issue with this is, how big the fb driver now becomes
because all the DRM stuff is in it... I think a radeon common, with
radeonfb/radeondrm is probably going to be needed,
Hopefully tomorrow (I've a day off, but the weather is getting nice as
well :-), I'll get some time to port some stuff to the vga class stuff,
I also want to prepare some patches for the kernel for the previous work
you've done ...
Dave.
