yup, tricky.
If there's a lesson here, it is "don't provide #defines in the header for
both versions".
The block code does a similar thing:
#define REQ_RW          (1 << __REQ_RW)
#define REQ_FAILFAST    (1 << __REQ_FAILFAST)
#define REQ_SORTED      (1 << __REQ_SORTED)
#define REQ_SOFTBARRIER (1 << __REQ_SOFTBARRIER)
and I've caught Jens using the wrong identifier at least twice in the past.
It's better I think to just provide #defines for the bit offsets and
open-code the shifting if needed.  Like PG_foo and BH_Foo.

That's true until you implement SMP ;)
