Thanks, I read the page... I find it to be a little extreme, and zero 
copy aio can get the same benefits without all that hassle.  Let me 
write this as a reply to the article itself:

I agree; all threads and cpus should be able to concurrently process 
network IO, and without wasting cpu cycles copying the data around 6 
times.  That does not, and should not mean moving the TCP/IP protocol to 
user space.

I agree; a minimum of work should be done in interrupt context. 
Specifically the interrupt handler should simply insert and remove 
packets from the queue and program the hardware registers for DMA access 
to the packet buffer memory.  If the hardware supports scatter/gather 
DMA, then the upper layers can enqueue packet buffers to send/recieve 
into/from and the interrupt handler just pulls packets off this queue 
when the hardware raises an interrupt to indicate it has completed the 
DMA transfer.
This is how NT and I believe BSD have been doing things for some time 
now, and the direction the Linux kernel is moving in.

I must admit, I am a bit confused by this.  It sounds a lot like the pot 
calling the kettle black to me.  Aren't SKBs and mbufs already just a 
form of the very queue of packets being advocated here?  Don't they 
simply list memory ranges for the driver to transfer to the nic as a 
packet?

How is this any different from what we have now, other than bypassing 
the kernel buffer?  The tcp/ip layer looks at the incoming packet to 
decide what socket it goes with, and copies it to the waiting buffer. 
Right now that waiting buffer is a kernel buffer, because at the time 
the packet arrives, the kernel does not have any user buffers.
If the user process uses aio though, it can hand the kernel a few 
buffers to receive into ahead of time so when the packets have been 
classified, they can be copied directly to the user buffer.

There is no need to use mmap() and burden the user code with 
implementing TCP itself ( which is quite a lot of work ).  It can hand 
the kernel buffers by queuing multiple O_DIRECT aio requests and the 
kernel can directly dump the data stream there after stripping off the 
headers.  When sending it can program the hardware to directly 
scatter/gather DMA from the user buffer attached to the aio request.

Yes, we can and should have a 6 times speed up, but as I've explained 
above, NT has had that for 10 years without having to push TCP into user 
space.
