I like the idea in principle. If this fully works out we could
potentially keep less memory free by default which would be a good
thing in general: free memory is bad memory.
But would be interesting to measure what the lock
changes do to interrupt latency. Probably nothing good.
A more benign alternative might be to just set a per CPU flag during
these critical sections and then only do atomic reclaim on a local
interrupt when the flag is not set.  That would make it a little less
reliable, but much less intrusive and with some luck still give many
of the benefits.
