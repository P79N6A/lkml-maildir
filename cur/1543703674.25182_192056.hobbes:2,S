Hi,
Whenever i try to enable DRI in X, my PC hangs on startup of the X
Server.
(If i do not load the agpgart and sis-agp modules, DRI is disabled).
I have a Gigabyte mainboard with a SiS 648FX Northbridge, and
and a Radeon 9200SE agp graphics board.
i use gentoo-dev-sources: kernel-2.6.1 with gentoo patches.
I have seen some patch mentioned on this list by Oliver Heilmann, but
couldn't find it anywhere. If he, or someone else who has this patch
could publish it, or send it to me, i would appreciate that.
cheers 
Robert Simons
