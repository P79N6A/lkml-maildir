In the extended version Vp/Pp to Sr as well but the current z/VM code
will discard a page if the host picks a Vr/Pr page to swap it.

Basically yes. The guest doesn't care about the host state.

It is very useful for debugging to have the host state in the guest as
well. There is one possible optimization: if the guests finds a Uz page
in the free list, it can make it Sz and doesn't have to clear it because
the host will provide an already empty page (not yet implemented
though).

I've search on my disk and found the state diagrams we've used for the
OLS paper. You may find these useful as well.
