i started seeing the problem a couple kernels back (maybe .65) when
there was a bit of noise on the list about scheduler changes.  i
usually run gqmpeg -> (mpg123|ogg123) -> esd -> alsa (maestro3).
i can reproduce it with just ogg123 -> alsa, but it's not as easy.
ogg123 -> esd -> alsa does it more.
i never had issues with this in the kernels before (< 2.5.65 or so).
here's a link to my original note back then:

i liked the boost in java performance ;), but it's come at a price
that is quite annoying (sound skips).  though, the extreme performance
of my jboss server went away in the 2.5.66, and the sound got a little
better, but it's still pretty bad.
