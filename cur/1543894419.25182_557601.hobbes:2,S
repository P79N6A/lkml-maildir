Nope. There is *NO* requirement *ANYWHERE* in the GPL, no matter the version, 
that says you have to *DISTRIBUTE* the source to *ANYONE* except those that 
you have given a binary to. Go read the licenses.

Exactly what I said. "only the people that have purchased the hardware have 
access to the modified sources"
That is *EXACTLY* what a number of companies have done - Acer (yes, the laptop 
company) has done that. They sell laptops running Linux, but unless you have 
purchased one of them you can't download the sources (or even replacement 
binaries) for the version of linux they put on their machines. (From Acer, 
that is)
However, as I also said, there is nothing stopping one of those people from 
making those "modified sources" available to the rest of the world. (I have 
yet to find someone that has done that with the Acer specific stuff, but...)

Yes, it does. However, the practicality is that there is nothing *stopping* 
the person upstream from getting a copy of the source and incorporating the 
modifications they contain in a new version.
