Well, the first entry is supposed to be AT_HWCAP, a number 16.
This is what I get:
long  value
0 = 00000020
1 = ffffe400
2 = 00000021
3 = ffffe000
4 = 00000010	Seems to start here?
5 = bfebfbff	Some bits
6 = 00000006	AT_PAGESZ
7 = 00001000	Correct
8 = 00000011	AT_CLKTCK
9 = 00000064	Correct
10 = 00000003
11 = 08048034
12 = 00000004
13 = 00000020
14 = 00000005
15 = 00000003
Nothing that makes any sense with the extra stuff in front.
I don't know where it came from.
