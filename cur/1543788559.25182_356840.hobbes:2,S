for those people wishing to keep the signal-to-noise ratio higher on LKML,
andreas has kindly offered to create LVML - Linux Visionaries list.

the creation and use of the LVML is neither to be taken seriously
nor lightly.
the length of time it took the recent distracting thread to die
after it went AWOL should be of concern to LKML readers.  having the
LVML around therefore provides a place where LKML readers can
gently hint, then firmly push, then forcibly shove aberrant posters
who don't necessarily have a coding clue but who have lots of enthusiasm
into their own playground, where they may meet like-minded enthusiastic
and vocal individuals who like to debate ideas.
i'll be honest with you: i am abivalent as to whether the LVML succeeds.
what i care about more is that the LKML is a useful specialist resource
that stays useful.  if LVML helps keep it that way, and helps reduce
the hostility towards people meandering in who really shouldn't be
there: great.
the key to the LVML: posts should ideally begin "i've been thinking..."
or "i have an idea." and should really be about the linux kernel.  if
you have lots of experience with other kernels; if you have lots of
experiences with many programming languages; if you have used a wide
range of OSes for a couple of decades, your opinions and insights on the
LVML would be most welcome.
let's see for example if we can distract Dave Cutler away from
his games consoles...
