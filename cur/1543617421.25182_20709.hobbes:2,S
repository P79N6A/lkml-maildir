Booting my machine with vanilla 2.5.3-pre1 ( obsiously with corrected
headers inclusion fix ) i've got and error from UMSDOS layer reporting a
failing msdos_read_super() ( at boot ) and a panic about a failure to
mount root. The interesting thing is that i do not have any msdos mounts,
least of all root.
