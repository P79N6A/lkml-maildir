This is not the criteria for keeping source files in the tree,
they really have to be used to stay there.
If you want to document the error codes and other interfaces, publish
the programming manual for your hardware on a web site.
Sorry if you don't like this, but the linux kernel is about more than
your driver and your needs, it's about the needs of maintaining a huge
behemoth source tree in some sane manner and part of achieving that
goal is important tasks such as eliminating unused code and source
files.
