No, with a freezer-based model you can basically *never* suspend to 
anything related to FUSE or a userspace USB device or anything involving 
userspace iSCSI initiators or whatever. Sure, there are cases where 
moving away from the current model doesn't buy you anything, but that 
doesn't mean that the current model is a good thing. It's not. The 
freezer is a fundamentally broken concept.

You're looking at a tiny amount of memory when compared to current 
systems. It's really not a problem.
