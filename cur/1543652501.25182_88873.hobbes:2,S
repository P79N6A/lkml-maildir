No update since I haven't had time to do any qd65xx testing in a while.
I strongly believe the bug is due to the fact that "ide=qd65xx" and
similar IDE chipset selection options are processed very very early in
the boot process, long before IDE's normal init.

This bug is still present in 2.5.47.

That one is a duplicate of the ide-dma oops I reported:

Alan stated he had IDE updates that would fix this.
