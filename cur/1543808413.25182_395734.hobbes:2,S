Yes, but userspace already knows if you are on AC power or not,
therefore it can decide what "current" means. If this is the only reason
then adding a new kernel infrastructure is overkill.
Also, doing things differently when on AC power smells like a policy
decision, and AFAIK policy handling is not wanted in the kernel.
