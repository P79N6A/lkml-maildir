The machines giving problems are almost identical when it comes to 
hardware specs :
Intel SE7520BD2 mainbord (SE7520 chipset)
Dual Intel Xeon 2.8 Ghz (other machine : Dual Xeon 3.2 Ghz)
4 GB PC3200 ECC (400 Mhz) Corsair (other machine : 2GB PC3200 ECC)

It's currently at 1.41. I'll see if I can upgrade it to 1.42. For now, 
I've put all available stacktraces when it hung on 
http://www.jdi-ict.nl/areca,
 together with a lspci -v -v and a copy of the 
kernel's .config
Please let me know if you need anything else.
Regards,
