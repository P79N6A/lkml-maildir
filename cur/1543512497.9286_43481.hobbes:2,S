Here's a copy of my news article (FYI):
Newsgroups: comp.protocols.time.ntp
Subject: announce: PPSkit-0.8.0 (new PPS API)
--text follows this line--
The PPS API implemented in PPSkit-0.7 has expired on October, 1st.
ntpd-4.0.98a still uses it. Anyway I implemented "draft-05" dated
1999-08-17 this weekend, making another "dot zero" release. The next
version of ntp-4.0 will be able to use the new API (just sent a first
bug fix). Do not update to the new API when running old sources,
because the interface is incompatible. Well ,you can enable the
hardpps() routine in the kernel using the new enable_pps.c...
As the new API is solely located in drivers/char/serial.c I made a
"delta-patch" based on PPSkit-0.7.2. If you have the serial driver as
loadable module, you don't even have to reboot (the change in
kernel/time.c is just paranoia).
So here come NEWS and LSM:

            Copyright (c) 1997, 1998, 1999 by Ulrich Windl
                            NEWS for 0.8.0
+ Updated documentation: ``INSTALL'' (prefer ntp-4.0), ``MANIFEST'',
  ``README''
+ Updated ``enable_pps.c'' to support new PPS API.  Added more error
  checking.
+ Updated documentation ``magic-number.txt'' to include
``PPSCLOCK_MAGIC''.
  Updated ``ioctl-number.txt'' to document the used numbers.
+ Updated PPS API to ``draft-05'' (dated 1999-08-17), causing severe
  incompatibilities (the older draft had expired).  Implemented new
  ``time_pps_kcbind()'' with ``PPS_TSFMT_TSPEC'' and ``PPS_KC_HARDPPS''.
