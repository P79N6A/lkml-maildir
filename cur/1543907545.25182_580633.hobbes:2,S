Ingo Molnar and group,
If their is a single RT task on this rq, then why not just reset the
timeslice and return??? Just MAYBE decreasing re-scheduling
overhead..
Thus,,,,
After
    p->time_slice = static_prio_timeslice(p->static_prio);
Why isn't their a check like
    if  (rq->nr_running == 1)
         return;
Which world remove the need for any recheduling
or requeue'ing...

FYI: below is believed to be a snap of the current/ orig func
-----------------------------
+static void task_tick_rt(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p)
+{
+ /*
+  * RR tasks need a special form of timeslice management.
+  * FIFO tasks have no timeslices.
+  */
+ if (p->policy != SCHED_RR)
+  return;
+
+ if (--p->time_slice)
+  return;
+
+ p->time_slice = static_prio_timeslice(p->static_prio);
+ set_tsk_need_resched(p);
+
+ /* put it at the end of the queue: */
+ requeue_task_rt(rq, p);
+}
