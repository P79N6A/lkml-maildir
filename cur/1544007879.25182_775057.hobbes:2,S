All of those can also be handled with traditional parallel data
busses too, of course.  Are you saying you've seen these used
with Linux systems?  Enough to justify generic support?
I've certainly seen how some of those LCD controllers, graphical
or character based, work with microcontrollers.  They're very
widely available too ... so I can imagine various uClinux systems
have one hooked up.  Most of the Linux system hookups I've happened
across use USB or serial links (e.g. the crystalfontz.com stuff)
since modern PCs are severely GPIO-deprived.
Another example where ganged access might help is keypad matrices.

Often times such messiness is more because the code never got
cleaned up, because it's kind of a one-off to support particular
boards.
You could say that the gpiolib implementation framework got its
start, in part, as a way to unclutter some kernel trees that
had way too much one-off stuff like that.  ;)
