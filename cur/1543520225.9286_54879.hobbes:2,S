That's the sort of problems I was getting - which seemed really strange at
the time.
The reason I got my Card driver's maintainer on the case was 'cos it looked
like
it was the card, whereas it was actually sg.[ch] so I'm working on deciding
whether or
not it'd work...
The problem is that 2.3.34 is 17mb to download, and I only have sneakernet
to take it home.
Plus I can't find the patch files at work so they must only be at home -
meaning I can't compare them
here :(
Aah well, off I go
Dan
