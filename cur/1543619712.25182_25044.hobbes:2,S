It makes it a very different problem because YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE 
BOOTING UNTIL THE USER TELLS YOU.
In fact, depending on just exactly what you're doing, you might not even 
know what you're booting until you have already gotten several items 
downloaded (consider, for example, a device-probing bootloader.)
Therefore, the bootloader must be able to obtain boot medium services 
not just once and for all, but on a back-and-forth basis.  There needs 
to be an API between the boot loader and the firmware, and just 
"stuffing it into memory" doesn't count.
