But aren't you basically unconditionally allowing a 4ms idle time after
reads? The complexity of AS (other than all the work we had to do to get
the block layer to cope with it), is getting it to turn off at (mostly)
the right times. Other than that, it is basically the deadline
scheduler.
I could be wrong, but it looks like you'll just run into the same sorts
of performance problems as AS initially had.
