What userspace-only changes could fix this?  Identify the common data,
write it to a flat file and mmap it, something like that?

There has been the occasional discussion about idenfifying all-zeroes
pages and scavenging them, repointing them at the zero page.  Could
this infrastructure be used for that?  (And how much would we gain from
it?)
