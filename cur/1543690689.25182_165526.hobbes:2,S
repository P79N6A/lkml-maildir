Hi Petr,
	I have the same problem with an Avocent SwitchView and Keytronic 
keyboard, although it doesn't sound as bad as your problem. Occasionally 
some keys just repeat until i press another key. I'm not quite sure what 
kind of information Vojtech would like. The machine is 440BX based and 
kernel is 2.6.0-test3-mm1
