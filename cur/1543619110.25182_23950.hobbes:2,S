Hi.  I've seen the following on both 2.4.18pre4 and 2.4.18pre7+preempt:
Lots & lots of these get warnings/errors get printed to the console and
syslog, and I don't know why.  i586, eth0 is a natsemi at 10Mbs half
duplex, eth1 is a natsemi at 100Mbs full duplex, eth2 is an Orinoco silver
in adhoc mode.  I didn't have this issue before I had 2.4.18pre4.  I
haven't noticed anything not "working", except my syslog is getting filled
up.
More output, including .config and dmesg output is available at
