double ouch.
You'll have a rough time selling me on the idea that some kernel thread
should be waking up every few seconds, grabbing system-wide locks, on a
big honkin NUMA box, for the few times per hour, or less, that a cpuset is
abandoned.
Offhand, that sounds mildly insane to me.
And how would this get the edge-triggered, rather than level-triggered,
release?  In other words, if a new cpuset is created, and marked with
the notify_on_release flag, but otherwise not yet used (no child
cpusets and no tasks in it) then it is not to be released (removed.)
Only children and/or tasks are added, then later removed, is it a
candidate for release.  I guess you'll need yet another state bit, set
when the cpuset is abandoned (last child removed or last pid
exits/leaves), and cleared when this kernel thread visits the cpuset to
see if it should be removed.
Can you explain to me how this intruded on the reference counting?
