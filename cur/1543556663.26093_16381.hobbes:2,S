No. At least udp_sendmsg uses the spec_dst_addr field as the source
address.  I added some code to my traceroute that lets you select the
source address in order to verify that.
However the good thing is that somewhere something seems to check that
the requested address is indeed one attached to a local interface.

But it doesn't return POLLERR. If it was returning it, pollfd.revents
would be set. pollfd.events is the event mask that's being passed _into_
the poll() call.
You're right about the IP_RETOPS stuff though. I didn't look closely enough;
ip_cmsg_send does expect raw options.
Thanks,
Olaf
