put_cpu() will work flawlessly when nested within a spinlock. the
spinlock disabled itself preemption, and a nested preemption
disable/enable/check will end up incrementing/decrementing the preempt
cours. The check at the end will just not call the scheduler when nested
within a spinlock.
If this is what you are worried about, then you shouldn't. I am a bit
surprised about your reaction though.. so I probably missed
something/don't understand correctly your fear about check_resched
within a spinlock.
