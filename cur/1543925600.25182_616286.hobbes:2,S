We do have checks for UTF-8.  The commit message problems are usually real
names in Signed-off-by:s being "complex" and being in their email locale
not UTF-8.  It is a problem area for sure as people want their email to
look right in their email to the list, and yet they need it in UTF-8 for git.
Yeah it looks like we pick it up ok, the message could do with a little
love:
    apw@pinky$ ~/git/checkpatch/checkpatch.pl -q --no-tree ./git-net.patch
    ERROR: Invalid UTF-8
    #229:
	This is based on a patch by Vicenç Beltran Querol.
