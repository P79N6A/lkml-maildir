If a write to an unwritten region requires a node split, that could result
in the allocation of new meta data which obviously could fail if the disk is
truly full.
Granted that's unlikely to happen but maybe we should be conservative and
say something like:
"After a successful call, subsequent writes are guaranteed to never require
allocation of file data." ?
