Architecturally, this was the design of ACPICA -- that anything
OS-dependent would be written in whatever format/style/exception
model/threading model/blah as the host OS.
We even discussed having an interface layer in order to translate
incoming requests (to ACPICA) from the host drivers to ACPICA requests,
and then translate the output (such as exception codes) back to the host
format, but we ended up deciding that this was overkill. 
I certainly agree that it is not a good idea to mix exception code
spaces.
