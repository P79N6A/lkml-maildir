This can't happen because lookup of non-existent entry doesn't create a
negative dentry.  The new dentry is never hashed and killed after lookup
failure, the above scenario can't happen.
That said, the mechanism is a bit too fragile.  sysfs currently ensures
that dentry/inode point to the associated sysfs_dirent.  This is mainly
remanent of conversion from previous VFS based implementation.  I think
the right thing to do here is to make sysfs behave like other proper
distributed filesystems using d_revalidate.
Thanks.
