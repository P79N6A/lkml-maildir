The only patch where I'd say this really applies to is 
better-i386-cpu-selection.patch .
I'm really happy that you added it in the latest -mm and I'm even more
happy that I haven't yet heard of any major breakage it has caused.
But it's your decision whether you like this patch or prefer to drop it.

The main effect is that better-i386-cpu-selection.patch makes it easier
for people who configure kernels that should work on different CPU
types. A user (= person compiling his own kernel) does no longer need
any deeper knowledge when e.g. configuring a kernel that should run on
both an Athlon and a Pentium 4 - he simply selects all CPUs he wants to
support in his kernel.
As a side effect, this patch allows further optimizations based on the 
fact that e.g. a kernel for an i386 no longer needs to support an Athlon 
which can be used to omit support for non-selected CPUs [1].

[1] e.g. there's no need to include arch/i386/kernel/cpu/amd.c in your
    kernel if the kernel should only run on a 386;
    I made two such example patches that are _way_ too ugly for merging
    but show that this CPU selection scheme makes some more space 
    savings possible
