If it is, then I guess all of the libpthread stuff on most of my
macghines is just wasting space...  Better just delete them with 50M
of /var/log since linux doesn't have system logging either (something
I heard a while back).

And this is bad how?
Not everything needs to be done at the kernel level - in fact, there
are a great many things that should definately /not/ be done there.
This, IMHO, is one of the places where NT really gets it wrong - they
want /everything/ (OK, I'm probably blowing it out of proportion a
bit) in the kernel, or at least part of the OS (yes, the browser is an
integral part of the 'windows experience', gee, what did we do until
the browser came along).  
This is adding unnecessary complexity, and the more complex something
is, the more things that can potentially go wrong, and this leads to
instability. 
/me hugs his Linux kernel, and steps off his soap-box
