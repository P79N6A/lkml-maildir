Thanks very much Kirill.
I don't think I'm qualified to make any decisions about this,
so I don't want to detract from the real discussions, but I
just had a couple more questions:

Are any future hardware solutions likely to improve these problems?

Is this considered secure enough that multiple untrusted VEs are run
on production systems?
What kind of users want this, who can't use alternatives like real
VMs?

Have their been any discussions between the groups pushing this
virtualization, and important kernel developers who are not part of
a virtualization effort? Ie. is there any consensus about the
future of these patches?
Thanks,
Nick
