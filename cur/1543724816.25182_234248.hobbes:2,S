Yes, that's sort of my point although you get the commit semantics
you want, albeit a little more usersapce signal overhead and an mprotect
call (you've already taken the exception so the extra signal overhead
shouldn't be too much), but perhaps less overall page faults than
MAP_SHARED (which is the mmap variant that writes dirtied pages back
to backing store) as you control when to mark the page clean again
ie. do the writeout at your commit point and not before.
Really my point was you don't use mmap for speed but rather for convenience.
