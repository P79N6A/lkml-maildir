Setting the number of cpus to 4 causes only 2 to be displayed in 
/proc/cpuinfo
(On a dual P4 Xeon (Hyperthreaded) machine which normally shows 4 CPUs)
I'm using...
*
* ACPI Support
*
ACPI Support (ACPI) [Y/n/?] y
   CPU Enumeration Only (ACPI_HT_ONLY) [Y/n/?] y
...to detect the HT Xeons.
Trying with CONFIG_NR_CPUS=5........Same
Trying with CONFIG_NR_CPUS=6........Same
Trying with CONFIG_NR_CPUS=7........3 Processors - Weird!
Trying with CONFIG_NR_CPUS=8........4 Processors - Hoorah!
Strange, or am I missing something?

[Me: Off to try CONFIG_NR_CPUS=32  :)]
