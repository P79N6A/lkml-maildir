I asked it to Rik too but he redirected me at some rpm, but luckily
Marc-Christian extracted it and he posted it on l-k some week ago, so
you can just check l-k (From: Marc-Christian) and you'll find it. It's
against 2.4 however. Problem is that it's absolutely useless for the
problem I had to solve, or I would be using it already instead.
