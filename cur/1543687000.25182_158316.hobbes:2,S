This appears to be a cruel joke! From whom does the kernel steal
'current' when obtaining a file descriptor? And, how-come there
is a CR/LF sequence for each end-of-line? Is this some DOS program?
If there are any developers using file-access in their modules,
as stated above, that stuff should never be included in the kernel.
If those persons want to permanently damage the OS by doing same,
then they can do whatever in their own trees.
Cheers,
