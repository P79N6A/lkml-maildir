Hi Riley.
Award's 4.51 BIOS definately supports all the boot sizes (including
hard disk image), as does Phoenix's 4.06 BIOS, and any BIOS that can
boot NT CDs can do non-emulation mode boots (loading an arbitrary
number of sectors from an arbitrary position on the CD into RAM).
The only feature in the spec that I can't find support for is the
non-boot emulation image (e.g. the machine boots from C:, but still
maps a CD image to A:). Mind you, the Phoenix BIOS I tested with
reported the sector size of the CD as 512 bytes :-(
