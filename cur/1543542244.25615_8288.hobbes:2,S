BTW, this is a little off-topic, I kind of wonder what the right semantics
for deadlock detection are with threads. POSIX 1003.1 1996-07-12 says:
  "A potential for deadlock occurs if a process controlling a locked
   region is put to sleep by attempting to lock the locked region of
   another process. If the system detects that sleeping until a
   locked region is unlocked would cause a deadlock, the fcntl()
   function shall fail with an [EDEADLK] error."
Okay, that's a little vague already. Now let's make it more interesting
by adding threads:
Process	Thread	Action (executed in this order)
A	1	grab lock X
B	1	grab lock Y
A	2	try to get lock Y
B	2	try to get lock X
Solaris 2.5.1 thinks this is a deadlock. Linux 2.4.0-test1-ac16 thinks
it isn't. I haven't found any definition of what "putting a process to
sleep" means in POSIX.1.
Opinions ?
