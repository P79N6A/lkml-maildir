Probably the 2.6.12 patch will be against 2.6.11, since:
  - The 2.6.11.x line may continue after 2.6.12 was released
  - 2.6.11.x may contain `quick and dirty' fixes for problems, which will be
    fixed `properly' in 2.6.12 (or later), cfr. Alan Cox' presentation at
    FOSDEM.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
