You might be able to verify this is true today, but it is a bit fragile 
and other changes might always add even more stack usage in some places. 
Therefore, functions using 1 kB stack aren't a good idea.
As an exercise, pkt_open() currently uses more than 0,5 kB stack
(kernel 2.6.16-rc2-mm1, i386, gcc 4.0). Try to understand where this 
stack usage comes from (hint: add up the stack usages of all only once 
used static functions gcc automatically inlines).
