Hi,
I made a small calculation of the time required to make a user-kernel
copy
and the amount of data have to be huge to give an impact - unless you
end
up with a page fault, what will happen then? (Something sensible I
guess,
like rescheduling during IO, but while reading code I found this)
from ext2/file.c(280..307) linux-2.2.13
interesting lines marked (a)..(d)
		/* Tricky: what happens if we are writing the complete
		 * contents of a block which is not currently
		 * initialised?  We have to obey the same
		 * synchronisation rules as the IO code, to prevent some
		 * other process from stomping on the buffer contents by
		 * refreshing them from disk while we are setting up the
		 * buffer.  The copy_from_user() can page fault, after
		 * all.  We also have to throw away partially successful
		 * copy_from_users to such buffers, since we can't trust
		 * the rest of the buffer_head in that case.  --sct */
(a)		new_buffer = (!buffer_uptodate(bh) && !buffer_locked(bh) &&
			      c == sb->s_blocksize);
(b)		if (new_buffer) {
			set_bit(BH_Lock, &bh->b_state);
(c)			c -= copy_from_user (bh->b_data + offset, buf, c);
(d)			if (c != sb->s_blocksize) {
				c = 0;
				unlock_buffer(bh);
				brelse(bh);
				if (!written)
					written = -EFAULT;
				break;
			}
			mark_buffer_uptodate(bh, 1);
			unlock_buffer(bh);
		} else {
                  
(a) Only buffers with "c == sb->s_blocksize" can be new_buffers
(b) Test for new buffers
(c.1) copy_from_user(..., c) will return c won't it???
(c.2) c -= c gives c = 0
(d)  if (c != sb->s_blocksize) ALWAYS true
  and the buffer gets thrown away...
(d') should not the test be "if (c != 0) then" to catch partial copies
