Hi Arnd
Thank you for reviewing that bit of code.  
I had a look at compat_sys_gettimeofday and sys32_gettimeofday codes.
They seem to work in a similar way, casting a pointer to the structure
from user space to a compat_timeval type.
But to make sure I have tested the routine by forcing the sk-
>sk_stamp.tv_sec value to 0 in the x25_module ( for testing purposes
only, as it is initialised to -1). Now when
I make a 32 bit userspace SIOCGSTAMP ioctl to the 64 bit kernel I should
get the current time back in user space. This seems to work, the ioctl
returns the system time (just after TEST6:)
So I have left the patch as is for now. However if necessary to use
the element-by-element __put_user routine as in put_tv32, then I can
make the change, just let me know.
Lastly, if anyone following this mail can help with adding this into the
next release, that would be really helpful. We are building a network
management application on linux for a telco and while they have 
the support of the SuSE's and Redhat's, any patches accepted by the
kernel community makes a difference, besides saving us from building
custom patches. (BTW, the application used to run on HP-UX, we are now
porting it to linux).
Many Thanks 
Shaun
