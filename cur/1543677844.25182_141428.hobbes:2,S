No, the content is not verified to be the same as on the nfs clients. But
this is not the point here, it could as well be bad content that is saved to
tape, and if you get wrong verification for this, your bad data simply got
worse. Right?

I have not managed to get the corruption on archives written to (the same)
3ware partition instead of tape up to this day.

No. See your second guess.

Yes, I am separately verifying with "-d".

See first post of the thread, in case it already vanished: 3 GB RAM, 320 GB
filesystem space, at least half free.

Hm, I haven't tried this so far. My next guess would have been not to verify
but to read the data completely in (to disk) again and then do a verification
based on a file-compare utility. If there is a difference one can have a real
look on the data, which is a bit of a mess on tape.

Well, two of the same kind :-)
