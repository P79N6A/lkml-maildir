In my experience we only care about cookies to be the same, and not
monotinically grow up. So this may just jump up and down, and since
events are potentially distributed in time (although follow one after
another), wrapping should roughly cover number of processes running (and
potentially renaming objects), so having 20 bits for the counter and 12
for the CPU id should be enough for now.
