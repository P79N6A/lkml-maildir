Please check
 - selected processor type: Pentium-Classic
 - compiled with gcc295 or equivalent
 - Leave frame buffers out
 - put only minimal drivers (including serial port and console on serial port)
If it still does not work, please get the oops via serial console, run
it through ksymoops, without it is not much we can do.
