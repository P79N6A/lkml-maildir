I'm missing something fundamental, and beg your indulgence.
My current 2.6 drivers support multiple indentical PCI boards.
The init code spins on pci_find_device and assigns instance/minor
numbers as boards are found.  Load script insmods the driver,
gets the major # from /proc/devices, and creates the /dev/ entries.
Not subscribed but lurking,
Bill
