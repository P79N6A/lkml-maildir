That's just one example... the idea is that you want maximal separation
between the guest OS's apps and the host OS.  Sort of like "VM" on IBM's
series of mainframe architecures.  Of course, that's virtualization done
in hardware not in software, but the principles are the same; you want a
maximal amount of separation between the layers.
