Is that a bug in the x86_64 subsystem ... or just a bug in the HW?
I'm assuming what happened is that the GART aperture was placed above
the 2GB limit making the GART unable to act as an IOMMU for any devices
with a dma_mask < 32bit?
This does show up a problem in our dma_ functions: namely that if the
system says it has an IOMMU then we assume it's fully functional (i.e.
able to reach all addresses).  There was a move afoot a while ago to
replace the single PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS macro which is used to tell the
system globally if we have an IOMMU with something like
dma_dev_uses_iommu(struct device *) which would do the same thing but on
a per-device basis.  Does this need to be resurrected?
