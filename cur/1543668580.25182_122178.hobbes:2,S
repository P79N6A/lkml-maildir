No, you're forgetting that the case Andrew rightly indicates is
covered by the ptecount check I added to page_convert_anon, and
commented at length there.  As I said yesterday, I don't think
this "Double check" on *pmd serves any real purpose as coded
(whereas the earlier "Double check" on *pgd is vital).
