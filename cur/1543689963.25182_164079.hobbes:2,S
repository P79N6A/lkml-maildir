Subject: Fix noop elevator request merging (in current 2.5 bk)

Hello!
   This patch is required otherwise in case if elv_try_last_merge returns nonzero, we do not
   initialise *req, and subsequent BUG_ON() in __make_request() will dies because req is NULL
   (or is just uninitialised).
   This stopped my UBD devices to work, that's how I noticed ;)
Bye,
    Oleg
