For ide-disk.c, ide-floppy.c and ide-cd.c patch is OK.  For ide-tape.c...
Not needed.
Keep in mind that current setup (some ioctls are unconditionally done
in fs/block_dev.c, for some we only call driver, for some - give
driver a chance and do our thing if it doesn't recongnize the ioctl)
will change.  Most of the 3rd group actually belong to the 1st one -
the only reason why they are not there is handling of unpartitioned
devices that don't have gendisks.  When that gets fixed, the kludge
with calling driver and handling -EINVAL will disappear...
