Hmmm I don't get it why you changed the return type of the
readl/writel macros to return unsigned long rather than u32 - is there
a reason for this other than to get sign extension?

What are you trying to achieve there? You run virt_to_phys() on a user
space address as far as I can read and stick it into something
labelled xferaddr? Normally you should never need the physical address
in a device driver unless you want to play with page table settings or
the like. If the address is to be handed to a DMA engine you should
never take the physical address, but rather use virt_to_bus() or even
better use the new 2.3+ PCI DMA API (pci_map_single()).
