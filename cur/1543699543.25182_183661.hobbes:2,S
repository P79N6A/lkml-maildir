Where is the sparse BK repository that used to be
bk://kernel.bkbits.net/torvalds/sparse ?
It seems there is an older version at bk://linux-dj.bkbits.net/sparse
Also in the subject, I got lots of "attribute 'alias': unknown attribute"
warnings in the kernel source in lines with module_init(), module_exit()
and others. A simple fix might be
	if (match_string_ident(attribute, "alias"))
		return NULL;
near the end of handle_attribute() in parse.c
