this is a myth; linux is free to move the page about in physical memory
even if it's mlock()ed!!
And even then, the user can munlock the memory from another thread etc
etc. Not a good idea.
get_user_pages() is used from AIO and other parts of the kernel for
similar purposes and in fact is designed for it, so it better work. If
it has bugs those should be fixed, not worked around!
