It also suffers from combinatorial explosion.
cp -a on 10^6 files will require ~0.5 * 10^12 compares...

Yes, and it should have been obvious at 32->64bit inode# transition.
Unfortunately people tend to think "ok, NOW this new shiny BIGNUM-bit
field is big enough for everybody". Then cycle repeats in five years...
I think the solution is that inode "numbers" should become
opaque _variable-length_ hashes. They are already just hash values,
this is nothing new. All problems stem from fixed width of inode# only.
