Subject: RFC: remove __read_mostly

I tried the following patch with a full x86 .config [1]:
--- a/include/asm-x86/cache.h
+++ b/include/asm-x86/cache.h
-#define __read_mostly __attribute__((__section__(".data.read_mostly")))
+/* #define __read_mostly __attribute__((__section__(".data.read_mostly"))) */
The result [2,3] was:
-rwxrwxr-x 1 bunk bunk 46607243 2007-12-13 19:50 vmlinux.old
-rwxrwxr-x 1 bunk bunk 46598691 2007-12-13 21:55 vmlinux
It's not a surprise that the kernel can become bigger when __read_mostly 
gets used, especially in cases where __read_mostly prevents gcc 
optimizations.
My question is:
Is there anywhere in the kernel a case where __read_mostly brings a 
measurable improvement or can it be removed?

[1] mostly allyesconfig with CONFIG_MODULES=n
[2] vmlinux.old is the unpatched kernel
[3] gcc 4.2 was used
