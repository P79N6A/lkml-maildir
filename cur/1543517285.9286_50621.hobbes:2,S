Hi all,
	Recently I upgraded my Redhat Linux box from RH5.2 to 6.1.
Everything worked excellent till day before yesterday when i downloaded
some of the upgraded rpms meant for RedHat 6.1, including following files.
Since I upgraded my Voice CD is not working although the sound card is
well detucted. Other CD are detucted.
