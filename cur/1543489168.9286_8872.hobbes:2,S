   I care, and it's going to be LE, simply because anything else is
   just asking for trouble with the x86 binary compatibility part.
I agree here, I had forgotten about this issue.
My question still stands as to where there is a mechanism like:
	ld	[%reg1 + imm] BIG_ENDIAN, %reg2
Like the Sparc has for endian selection on a per-load/store basis.
Later,
