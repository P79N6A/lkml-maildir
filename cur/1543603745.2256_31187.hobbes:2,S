I can confirm that in 2.4.11-pre4, the used-once pages are causing
page-out activity, as opposed to 2.4.11-pre2 which did not.  Streaming i/o
performce is down, and so is the interactive responsiveness (a lot).  To
reproduce, run
	dd if=/dev/hde1 of=/dev/null bs=4k
This should not produce paging.  The block size is not important.
