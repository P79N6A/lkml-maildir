So you don't recompile, but you still changed the magic ioctl numbers
from 17 to 47 and from 18 to 48.  Old binaries don't work any more,
even though the same semantics are still present.  That is an
incompatible change in my book.
Worse if there is a new semantic for 17 or 18, in that case the old
binaries may break randomly, depending on kernel version.
