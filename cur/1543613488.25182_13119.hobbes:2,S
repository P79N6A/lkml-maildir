Forget wanxl, it's not yet ready. Forget pc300too, I'm probably going
to keep it outside the main kernel.
Anyway, incremental patch is better, I'm going to submit my paches
to 2.5 after some features (FR InARP, DCD handling, probably FR bridging)
are added and tested.

Seems it's better to include that things in 2.4 when it works fine.
Especially if all drivers are updated.
2.5 first - of course.
