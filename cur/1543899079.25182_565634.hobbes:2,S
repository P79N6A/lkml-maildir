That's the problem.
It *looks* *fine*.
The "&nbsp" doesn't look any different from a regular space. There's no 
way to tell the difference. Except it doesn't *work* the same. You 
cut-and-paste it into a shell window, and that shell window will not 
consider a nbsp to be the same thing as a space.
And I don't really understand why Kmail would do something like that. They 
obviously do it on purpose, since the nbsp wasn't there originally, so 
they literally go do extra work to _corrupt_ the data they cut-and-paste. 
Why do it? Who knows. But it's really sad.
