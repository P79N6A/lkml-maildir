hi all,
maybe, I'm bothering you, but since 2.3.10 I've tried to build a working
root/bootdisk - every version results in an Oops :(
I'm tired now...
I'm  not a c-coder, but some weeks ago, I've posted informations about
this bug-behaviour - but got no response.
So, what else can I do ?
In a private mail, Alan Cox answer was "The ramdisk stuff is still rather
broken".
Is there anybody working on this subject?
If so, please mail me!
regards
ralf
