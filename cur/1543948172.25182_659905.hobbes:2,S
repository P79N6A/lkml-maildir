Thanks for the timely info.  I'm not in an undue hurry to get this
merged.  As long as we're moving forward, I'm happy.
What about pushing the fb_defio fixes independently of any new
fb_defio users?  If fb_defio was worth merging into Linus's tree, it
should be worth fixing there, whether new users are in shape already
or not.
If we must have a new user, well, I could easily whip up something
like FB_VIRTUAL on top of fb_defio.
