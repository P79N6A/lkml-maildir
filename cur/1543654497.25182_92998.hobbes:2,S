First, lets get one thing straight:  the problem is the slowness,
not necessarily the swap usage.  It is very easy to jump to wrong
conclusions, so lets keep focussed on that part of the problem
which we know to be true before we all start hacking on parts of
the system which aren't related to the slowness...

How about some output (maybe 20 lines) of 'vmstat 1' during the
time where your system is slow, together with a short description
of how large the various processes (X, Mozilla ...) in your system
are ?

Rik
