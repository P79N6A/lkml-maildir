No, the problem is that the chipset in the laptop has extra registers
to power-down circuitry, like the IDE, when power management is
activated by the BIOS.  The Linux IDE driver has no knowledge of
those chipsets, and therefore does not know anything about how to
turn them back on again so it can talk to the drives.
Note that this is separate from the logic/control for spinning down/up
the drives themselves, which linux already handles just fine.
Support for that could be added someday to the linux power mgmt code.
