Ouch.. that means all that someone issued a multiple segment data
transfer with a 2 byte aligned chunk in the middle.
That is a bit of a suprise because we set blk_queue_dma_alignment to 3 so
the block layer should never hand us an sg list in that form. That means
we've either got a block layer bug or someone somewhere is generating
invalid sg lists internally to libata.
Can you dump qc->cdb[] and see what command is getting issued in the
broken form ?
