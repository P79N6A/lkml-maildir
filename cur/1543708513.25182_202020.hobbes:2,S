This (i.e. automatic renicing of specified programs) is a good idea but 
is not really a function that should be undertaken by the scheduler 
itself.  Two possible solutions spring to mind:
1. modify the do_execve() in fs/exec.c to renice tasks when they execute 
specified binaries
2. have a user space daemon poll running tasks periodically and renice 
them if they are running specified binaries
Both of these solutions have their advantages and disadvantages, are 
(obviously) complicated than I've made them sound and would require a 
great deal of care to be taken during their implementation.  However, I 
think that they are both doable.  My personal preference would be for 
the in kernel solution on the grounds of efficiency.
