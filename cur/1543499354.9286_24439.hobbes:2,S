One thing I've wondered about ever since I
heard about it (I think NTFS has it), was 
whether for small files, the data could be
stored inside the inode. After all, there
are at least 13 4-byte entries that could
be used.
I was mainly thinking of this for symlinks
because they are generally really short.
Actually, for symlinks it would be really
easy because you cannot edit a symlink, you
have to delete it and recreate it, so the size
never changes.
Ofcourse they may have already been done, but
I don't think so AFAIK.
This would save a seek and a read for the symlink
because the data is already in the inode.
Comments?
