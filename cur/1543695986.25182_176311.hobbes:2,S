Oh, yes. HPET timer needs ACPI support to work (also HPET is not present on 
many machines). You can probably find 'Warning: clock= override failed' in 
your dmesg. The default timer is then set to PIT. Determination of CPU clock 
when using PIT is not implemented in the kernel, so it's reported as zero in 
/proc/cpufreq. You may also find some patches around the LKML adding support 
for ACPI timer, but it needs ACPI itself. I didn't try it.
