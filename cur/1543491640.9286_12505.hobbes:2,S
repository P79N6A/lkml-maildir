Ah, thanks.  I've tried to struggle through these before, but have the
problem that I don't know the order in which they are produced.  Can you
(or anyone) spare a hint as to where to find this info?  I've looked,
but seemingly in the wrong places.  (I just tried strace to find out,
but vfork killed that idea)
