Maybe, but DTrace seems to solve one really pressing problem: tracking
disk I/O to the processes causing it.  Unexplained high I/O
utilization is a *very* common problem, and there aren't any tools to
diagnose it.
Most other system resources can be tracked quite easily: disk space,
CPU time, committed address space, even network I/O (with tcpdump and
netstat -p).  But there's no such thing for disk I/O.
