While he could of wrapped the test dependent in #ifdef/#endif
CONFIG_SMP, the test really is not overly needed.  It is more a result
of the previous code, which Bob Miller himself fixed up and then much
rewrote the locking for.
Since he recently did the cleanup (and even added that BUG_ON) I trust
he knows if we can remove it.
