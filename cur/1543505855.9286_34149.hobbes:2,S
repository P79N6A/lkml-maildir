This is fine. Be aware that if the message is issued from the context
of a typical socket sender you must avoid deadlocks - ie holding the memory
your magic message will come from.

If you set dev->tbusy and refuse packets they will be queued for you and
eventually spilled if you get too much congestion. When the interrupt occurs
you can then dev->tbusy=0; mark_bh(NET_BH) and it will let rip.
To reduce latency if this is an issue, remember one buffer in the card driver
itself and when the magic message occurs send this first buffer as well.
