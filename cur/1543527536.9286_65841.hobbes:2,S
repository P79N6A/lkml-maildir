I made a jumbo patch (which is in the kernel now) quite some time back to
fix a few dozen files that weren't including string.h and so were
(inadvertently) using the compiler builtins. Nobody had noticed, so I do
believe you ;-)
There was a great fight over that issue then, with people claiming that the
kernel reimplementations where _much_ better than what gcc-2.7.2.3 gave.
Maybe they are, but using 2.7.2.3 is just bowing to political correctness
right now, IMHO. During 2.1.x much was overhauled for the stricter asm()
handling by egcs, and lots of bugs (asuming gcc would or would not do
certain optimizations) were fixed in the process. Today's gcc is 2.95.2,
2.7.2.3 is a dinosaur (and should have gone with them).
