no, at least not in the current kernel. as was mentioned earlier in this thread 
the ipw2200 needs the firmware at initialization, but some others don't need it 
until open. I don't know if it's even possible to re-write the driver to do 
this.

this isn't my understanding.
my understanding is that the kernel fully initializes all built-in drivers, then 
loads userspace and starts running it.
that userspace can be on a device that it knows how to read, or it can be 
userspace on initramfs so that you can load additional modules to give you 
access to the hardware that you want to run on.
this is needed if your root drive is a SCSI drive and you have it's driver 
compiled as a module for example.
this is needed if your root drive uses dm and you need to initialize the array 
(one advantage of md, from the user standpoint, is that it doesn't require this 
additional layer before use)
however this is not soon enough to supply the firmware for devices like this.

if the firmware needed for any drivers compiled in was appended to the kernel 
the same way that initramfs is, without requireing the other things needed to 
make initrmfs useable I think that would be reasonable (bundling them togeather 
as opposed to embedding the firmware in the kernel). it may even be possible to 
have the firmware as files in a initramfs that contains nothing else, and the 
kernel knows how to read the data directly (without the hotplug firmware request 
userspace stuff)

adding an initramfs to a system that doesn't need it otherwise adds 
complications to the configure and boot process.
requireing modules when they weren't required before adds complication, and 
if/when the patch that's floating around to eliminate access to /dev/kmem is 
ever accepted, there are security advantages of running a kernel that doesn't 
have any support for run-time modifications (i.e. module loading).
I realize that many people want to make initramfs mandatory (with things like 
partition detection moved to userspace), but unless there is a standard 
initramfs that is shipped and maintained with the kernel to implement things 
like this (see the klibc discussion a few weeks ago) you are adding 
complications without much of a benifit to the user.
