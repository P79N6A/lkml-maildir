Sure, I meant to do the HPET changes to i386 separate as a preparatory
patch.
Sharing HPET before the conversion is nasty at best (it involves a ton
of ifdeffery at least).

Well, we know that it works on i386, but once we turn on the x64 switch
we have not tested the shared code for x64 yet.
I try to find some practicable compromise between the big bang patch and
the theoretical gradual optimum.

I said before, that I'm going to split them further.
