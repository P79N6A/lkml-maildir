It works for me, and for sure it works for most others. Otherwise I would
have seen lot of complaints like yours.
I recall one similar post, and the person in question used a homegrown
script that caused the problems.
Could you try to post:
a) Exact command used when building the kernel.
b) Output of kernel compile [first 100 lines] after a make clean
This may give me a hint of what is wrong.
