I've talked with some clue-enabled people at 3ware about this.  The
newest driver is indeed broken on cards with very old firmware, and the
next revision of the driver will fix that problem.
There's a trivial fix for 2.4.20: just get rid of the error case around
line 1016 of 3w-xxxx.c.  This is basically the fix 3ware is planning to
include in the next driver release.
Patch attached.
