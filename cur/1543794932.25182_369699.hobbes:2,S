Finding all of the utilities and userspace applications that depend on
some specific POSIX behavior is hard; and convincing them to change,
instead of fixing the buggy OS, is even harder.  But that's OK, no one
has to use your filesystem (or operating system) if doesn't conform to
standards enough that your applications start breaking.

Um, where?  Actually, we're pretty close, and we often spend quite a
bit of time fixing places where we don't conform to the standards
correctly.  Look at all of the work that's gone into the kernel to
make Linux's threads support POSIX compliant, for example.  We did
*not* tell everyone to go rewrite their applications to use
LinuxThreads, even if certain aspects of Posix threads are a little
brain-damaged.
