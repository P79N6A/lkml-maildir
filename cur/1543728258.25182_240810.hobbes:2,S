All FPU usage is explicit, and VISEntry (if using the full FPU register
set) or VISEntryHalf (if using only the lower 32 registers) calls
are made to enter an FPU usage area, and VISExit/VISExitHalf is invoked
afterwards.
We could do it with traps, but there is no reason when we know
exactly where these places are and the save code is only a
handful of instructions.
