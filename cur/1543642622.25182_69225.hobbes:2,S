That is correct, but it is not the issue though.  The issue is that
completely unrelated processes can spoof/destroy each other's messages.
If a queue is set up with mq_open(name, O_CREAT|O_RDWR, S_IWOTH, &attr),
the process which set it up expects that "others" (processes not owned
by the user or by users in his/her group) will be able to send, and only
send, messages.  If shared memory is used, "others" must be able to
update the data structures representing the queue, so they will be able
to do a lot more than just send.
The fundamental problem is that filesystem permissions do not map
cleanly to message queue permissions.  Does this make sense?  Thanks.
