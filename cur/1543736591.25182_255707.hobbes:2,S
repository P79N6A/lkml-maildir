Alan,
 this seems to be corrupted. A quick read-through found this in 
generic_serial.c:
+       ld = tty_ldisc_ref(tty);
+       if (ld != NULL) {
+               ld->flush_buffer)
+                       ld->flush_buffer(tty);
+               tty_ldisc_deref(ld);
+       }
I can see the missing "if (" in my mind, but I'm wondering what else I 
might have missed. Ie can we have this patch be tested a bit more first?
