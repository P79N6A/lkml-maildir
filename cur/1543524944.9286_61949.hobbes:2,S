If you're having problems with the BP6 crashing on you, could you try the
"QQ" beta bios (www.bp6.com will point you in the right place)?  For me and
at least one other person, the QQ bios seems to fix a lot of problems.  If
you want to discuss the BP6 further, try the mailing list referenced in the
FAQ at 
http://www.snurgle.org/~griffon/bp6-linux.html
 , the linux-kernel
list isn't really the appropriate place to discuss broken hardware, even if
Linux does tend to exacerbate the situation.
It sounds like you're also running into problems with the HPT66 IDE
controller, those are independant of the BP6 lockup problems, but I can't
realyl help since I use SCSI.  People on the aforementioned list would
probably be a good way to get help tho.
