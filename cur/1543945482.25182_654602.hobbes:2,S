Something's wrong here.  Running LTP's msgctl08 (specifically:
ltp-full-20070228) cripples the machine.  It's a 4-way 4GB x86_64.

Normally msgctl08 will complete in a second or two.  With this patch I
don't know how long it will take to complete, and the machine is horridly
bogged down.  It does recover if you manage to kill msgctl08.  Feels like
a terrible memory shortage, but there's plenty of memory free and it isn't
swapping.
