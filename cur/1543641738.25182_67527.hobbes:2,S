You are correct.  In addition you need the vfsmount to pin it to a
unique point in the namespace.  As I mentioned, the dentry/vfsmount
pair is an anticipated change.

No, this does not sound like a safe transition.  For starters we want a
fail safe mechanism.

Indeed, however the invasive nature of a purely permissive policy along
with the ease of bugs is not a good way to begin merging a new project ;-)
Also, the capability interface provides a coarse grained permissive
interface, so all is not lost.

Yes, this is intentional.  Of course, depending on your notion of
security feature, it may already be supported or not fall into the
category of access controls, which LSM is providing.

Please review the LSM list archives as this has been discussed
extensively.  The executive summary is that a restrictive design
provides simple assurance.  A permissive design is both more invasive
and makes it easy to write dumb security bugs.  The current focus is
merging the restrictive interface, later we can look at enhancements.
Basic walk before run philosophy ;-)
