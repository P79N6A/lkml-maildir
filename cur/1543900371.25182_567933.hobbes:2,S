Hm, I don't usually get thanks emails.  Do other people?

I can understand being disappointed, but not quite as upset as you
appear to be.
so have you (Ingo) reviewed the ext4 patches?  or reiser4 patches?
or lumpy reclaim?  or anti-fragmentation?
I certainly haven't.  I can barely keep up with reading about 1/2
of lkml emails.  And in my non-scientific method, I think that we
are suffering from both (a) more patch submittals and (b) fewer
qualified reviewers (per kernel KLOC) than we had 3-5 years ago.
I don't see how you can expect Andrew to review these or any other
specific patchset.  Do you have some suggestions on how to clone
Andrew?
