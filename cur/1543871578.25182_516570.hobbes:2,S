The name of the option is not CCTS, but CRTSCTS, isn't it? So, you may
not only want to pause own transmission when CTS is inactive, but to
control the transmission flow from the remote side. Why should RTS be
active when the port is open even without CRTSCTS? You may still
assert RTS manually if it is used to provide +12V to the device. But
as I understand it is not common use of this pin, isn't it?
And a question is not only about supporting legacy equipment but also
about embedded hardware where RTS/CTS handshaking is handshaking, not
something else...
