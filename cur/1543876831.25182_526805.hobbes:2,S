I thought this is what the read_zero_pagealigned hack [1] was used
for (read from /dev/zero replaces target pages with empty_zero_page).
Now if read_zero_pagealigned does not solve _this_ scenario, is it
good for anything else then? 
Can we simply kill that function as a misfeature and avoid future
pain arising from it?
