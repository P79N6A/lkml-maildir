If I tear down CPU#1 right before I tell the kernel to hibernate, then
the box must explode in the same way. It does not. On none of 4 tested
laptops. 
Of course only the jinxed VAIO one exposes the "please press a key
problem".
I need to follow down the swsusp_suspend() code path to figure out, why
this breaks the box.
