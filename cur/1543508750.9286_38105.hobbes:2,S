It is entirely possible that to properly implement the exact POSIX signal
semantics, we'll need some more additions to clone() to enforce this.
However, it's still completely unrelated to pid sharing (in fact, I've
already got a version of LinuxThreads where all threads believe they share
pid, and have separate tid's; and there's even some support for userspace
signal handling in place...)
