Gentoo:
1) Watch for it to install gcc 3.4.*. Chances of successful build are much
   higher than with 3.3. Use --g switch of crossdev (_especially_ with
   s390).
2) -s1 means "binutils + C compiler and nothing more".
3) re ia64
	I was told that "ia64 is known to not cross compile at all due
	to the unwind code". #101626.
4) re m68k
	binutils only. Haven't investigated.
5) re mips64
	Ditto.
6) re mips
	Builds OK. Naive allyesconfig with CROSS_COMPILE=mips-... barfs
	at me violently mentioning some compiler switches.
The following is the list of cross-compilers I successfully use on -git
snapshots. Again, watch for the script to install 3.4.4[-r1].
Always use "crossdev -p ..." first.
# emerge crossdev
# echo 'PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/usr/local/portage"' >>/etc/make.conf
# crossdev -v -s1 -t alpha-unknown-linux-gnu
# crossdev -v -s1 -t arm-unknown-linux-gnu
# crossdev -v -s1 -t hppa-unknown-linux-gnu
# crossdev -v -s1 -t s390-unknown-linux-gnu
# crossdev -v -s1 -t powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu
# crossdev -v -s1 -t powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu
# crossdev -v -s1 -t sparc-unknown-linux-gnu
# crossdev -v -s1 -t sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu
# crossdev -v -s1 -t sh-unknown-linux-gnu
# crossdev -v -s1 -t sh64-unknown-linux-gnu
# crossdev -v -s1 -t x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
