diffstats are nice.  Yes, please put them after the ^---
wrt changelogs: yes, I do edit away all the fluff, but it doesn't take long.
This is totally anal, but my pet peeve is changelogs which start with "This
patch frobs the nozzle to ..".  I often change that to "Frob the nozzle
to...", because the "This patch ...." stuff is wholly redundant once the
thing hits the git tree.
What's remarkable is how many English sentences still make sense if you
blindly convert "This patch <word>s ..." into "<Word> ...".  It's
practically automatable.

Ah, sorry.  I had a big consolidation yesterday: folded over 50 fixup
patches into their parent patches.
