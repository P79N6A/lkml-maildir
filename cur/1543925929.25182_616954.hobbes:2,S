Simple?
Everything you have in mind with "should double check their changes" is 
simply not realistic with dozens of known unfixed regressions within 
more than half a million changed or new lines of code written by more 
than 800 people - all numbers only counted since 2.6.23.

Maintainers are just humans with limited time. 
You were the one who suggested to "distribute code maintainership", 
so you should explain how to find the additional maintainers.

code writer != subsystem maintainer
And git-bisect is the tool that tells you who broke it.

git-bisect can help only for regressions, and it can help for most 
regressions.
And you shouldn't try to make a problem out of something that isn't a 
problem:
Bug submitters are either volunteers who test -rc or even -git or -mm 
kernels for finding bugs or people who want a problem they experience 
fixed.
In both cases the submitters are usually willing to invest some time for 
helping to get the bug fixed.
