Robert I am running 2.4.19-pre2-ac2 + preemption + lock-break.
It is very snappy due to lock-break I think.
But lock-break failed on vmscan.c and I didn't apply it by hand this time.
There was another fail but it was small and easily fixable.
We need a new lock-break, soon.
Sadly it is relative hard to put sched-O1-2.4.18-pre8-K3.patch and preemption 
on top of 2.4.19pre2aa1 which I did for several weeks before. The throughput 
with -aa VM maintenance is much better then with -ac.
Latest -aa is 2.4.18-pre8-K3-VM-24-preempt-lock.
Regards,
	Dieter
