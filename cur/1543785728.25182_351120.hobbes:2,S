Subject: kallsyms error when compiling 2.6.13 + patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

After applying this patch:
http://www.candelatech.com/oss/candela_2.6.13.patch
and using this config:
http://www.candelatech.com/oss/kernel26_p2.cfg
I had to set the CONFIG_KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS option
to get the compile to work.
Compile machine is up-to-date FC2 system (dual Xeon).
Is this a known issue?
Thanks,
Ben
