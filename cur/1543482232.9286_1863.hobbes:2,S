Subject: Announce (and questions): Linux 2.2 VGA 640x480x16 framebuffer driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

For use mainly by graphical installation disks, I have written a
`least common denominator' 640x480x16 framebuffer for VGA and
compatible cards.  It is essentially complete.  You can find it at
	
http://pfaffben.user.msu.edu/~blp
and

To use it, patch a 2.2.0 kernel pre-patch with vga16.patch, then
select `VGA 16-color graphics console' and `VGA 16-color planar
support' in configuration.  When you reboot, you must specify vga=274
(which is 0x112 in hex) to kick your card into the proper video mode
for use by VGA16 (I have not implemented mode-setting yet).
Question: does anyone know why the entire screen turns white before
the kernel messages start scrolling up?  I hunted through the kernel
source code for this, but couldn't quite figure it out.
Additional comments and suggestions are welcome.
Thanks,
Ben.
