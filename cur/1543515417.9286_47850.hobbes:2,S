  Hi, all. Version 137 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This is against 2.3.25. Highlights of this release:
- Really fixed bug in fs/partitions/check.c when rescanning
- Support new "disc" naming scheme in <get_removable_partition>
- Allow NULL fops in <devfs_register>
- Removed redundant name functions in SCSI disc and IDE drivers
				Regards,
					Richard....
