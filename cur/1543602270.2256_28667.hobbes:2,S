Sorry, my explanation of the checker may not have been clear enough-- a
format string error does not occur because the kernel dereferences a user
pointer.  It happens because the format string to a printing function is
set by the user.  You are correct that ifr_name[] is not a user pointer,
but the contents of that array could contain dangerous placeholders set by
the user.  I hope that clears things up.
