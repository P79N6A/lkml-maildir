Err, scratch this (and related comments), I just realized what you were
trying to do. That's different from what I had in mind and so I read
your code wrong. I'll read it (and test it) again not making this
incorrect assumption and my comments will likely be different after
that. Well, I still think that it needs to be changed a bit, but
probably not in the direction I suggested at first (which, I realize
now, has its own share of issues - so it's not fair to me to point you
there.)
Sorry for the trouble. I'll post updated comments later today, but I'm
also pretty busy with other issues, some of which need to be solved
before 2.6.24 is released so I can't really delay them.
