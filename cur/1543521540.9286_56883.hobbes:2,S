One problem I forsee with the "2k38 bug"(TM) is that people
assume that we will have to wait 38 years to see it.  Any data at
all that uses time_t type will be limited to 2038 correct?
People always assume that the data stored in variables of type
time_t are todays date.  Why is this the case?  What if I write a
program that makes future predictions of something, or includes
data for future events?  Granted, I'm smart enough to NOT use
time_t right now, but to use alternative means to deal with
infinite dates, but lets assume someone does create software that
uses time_t.  Perhaps they generate star position data forecasts
for the next 15 years..  Then in 2023 they will have overflow
problems.
I think that the best time to work on this type of problem is
sooner than later.  In 10 years it is likely everyone will mostly
be using Linux anyways.  If we fix the problem NOW, we save the
trouble down the road.  Especially with embedded systems.
I think is should be strongly considered to try to fix the
problem in 2.5.x - even if it needs to be a compile time or
runtime configureable thing.
That is my $0.02 anyways.
