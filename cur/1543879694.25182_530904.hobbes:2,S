Okay, would it make sense to use "long" instead of "int" after "milli" to
"micro" conversion? On 32 bit machines int gives +-2147483648 limit. So
2147 volts/amperes/...
Though 2147 amperes is unrealistic for batteries, but if used in
calculations it could be dangerous.
For example:
di->life_sec = -((di->accum_current_uAh - di->empty_uAh) *
                 3600) / di->current_uA;
It can be also solved (and I voting for it) by typecasting to long
in the driver itself.
Would it also make sense to use int64_t instead of long? And how should
it passed to printk in portable way? I guess printk (vsprintf) does not
support PRIx notation as defined in /usr/include/inttypes.h ?
