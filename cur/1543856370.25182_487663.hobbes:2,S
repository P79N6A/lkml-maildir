my msi s270 laptop. but all vanilla kernel I ever tried do
that, also the debian and ubuntu kernel are instable too.
But: xen 3.0.2 plus xen'ified linux 2.6.16.31 are rock solid.
any idea what the issue could be? I'm running 64bit kernel,
64bit userland (plus some 32bit apps), and the cpu is a turion
mt-40 (sempron users seem to not have this problem).
I documented all details, config files, dmesg, /proc/interrupts,
lspci -vvv and xorg log file at
	
http://www.megawiki.org/wiki/S270Crashing
I can also mail you all those files (didn't want to spam
linux-kernel with a huge mail), and provide any other information
that can help, try patches or command line options, or different
compile options or whatever you can suggest.
Thanks for your help!
Regards, Andreas
