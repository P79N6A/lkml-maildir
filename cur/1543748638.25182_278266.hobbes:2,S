I'm afraid I must reject this patch.  We do not wish to put
hardware-specific workarounds in libata-core.c or libata-scsi.c.
I would suggest either
(a) finding a way to add the workaround to sata_uli.c, or
(b) finding the "root cause" of the problem, and determine why the
libata code is insufficient.
Two suggestions I have while investigating your problem:
1) Replacing the ->phy_reset() hook may allow you to solve the problem
in sata_uli.c.
2) It is entirely possible that we need to add additional error handling
code to libata, including hooks back into the low-level driver (such as
sata_uli.c).
