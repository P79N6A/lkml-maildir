This turned out to be the problem. There is a new generation of IBM Deskstar
drives (that are really nice drives :-) that have the same incompatibility
with the HPT-366 chip as the older IBM drives did. Below is a patch to add
the entire series to the "bad drives" lists, although I personally have only
experienced the problem with the 41G model I think it's logical to assume
they'll all have the same problem.
Drives work fine once this patch is in place, although only in ATA-44 (weird
mode).
