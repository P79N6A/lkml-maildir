Hi guys,
I am having a problem with a new dual box, its a dual athlon 1900+,
in a Asus A7M-266-D. When I try using MPS 1.4 the kernel gets upto
printing out CPU1:<T0:...  but no further.
When I switch to MPS 1.1 everything works correctly?
After doing some research I found that by adding the noapic and apm=off
kernel parameters everything started to work with 1.4.
Is this normal? Is it better to run with 1.1 or 1.4 and noapic?
If you need more info please ask :)
Thanks
Dave
