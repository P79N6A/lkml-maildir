no, the return value after idling can be completely random on some 
boxes, on a 64-bit scale - triggering the softlockup watchdog randomly. 
(some boxes return random TSC values, etc.) Again, it's fine for the 
scheduler's purpose, that's why i named it sched_clock().
the proper clocksource use within the kernel is ktime_get() [or 
ktime_get_ts()]. Do not abuse sched_clock() for such things.
