As far as I could tell, "scan" simply caused the nonstandard video
driver scan modules (unsafe probes) to be invoked.  Since those modules
are no longer present, there appeared to be no need for them.  The VGA
and VESA probes are safe.

I was considering also making the MCA code dependent on CONFIG_MCA, but
realized it would be better to have it at least be compiled, to prevent
bitrot.  It could be added back in to add a handful of bytes.

Yes, it is, at least by a bootloader that follows protocol.  I don't
know of any bootloader that are out of spec in that regard.

It doesn't, because e.g. Voyager needs special A20 code, etc.  I guess
we could dynamically detect Voyager and then do that, but that would
require testing.

I don't think that's either desirable or practical.  That code really
wants ready addressability of the whole image.
