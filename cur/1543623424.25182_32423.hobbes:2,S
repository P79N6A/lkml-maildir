Yes, I agree with the fact that it is complex. Right now, you need
to get a good understanding of them in order for them to be useful.
However I think this is the price to pay for something that covers a large
range of cases, from the simplest one to very complex ones. The simpler
implementation you are talking about will be useless as soon as you'll
need to cover more complex cases.
A good thing would be to define an API on top of CpuMemSets to allow
interested people to use them quickly for those simple cases.
