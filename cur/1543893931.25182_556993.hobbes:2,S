Wrong, the GPLv2 says:
"For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code 
for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition 
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of 
the executable."
The question is whether this includes private keys.
Different people have different opinions regarding this issue.
