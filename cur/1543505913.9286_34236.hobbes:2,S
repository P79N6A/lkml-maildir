Hello there.
I was trying to compile kernel to boot up my PowerPC
system (i think it's a PREP platform, CPU 601, RS/6000 by IBM,
64Mb RAM)
i configured kernel with minimum options just to see
if its wiorking. i compile it with serial console built-in.
when i'm booting up then i see:
loaded at:     0039ABE0 003B19F0
relocated to:  00800000 00816E10
board data at: 001033F0 00109DFC
relocated to:  00810304 00816D10
zimage at:     003A5BE0 003FD69D
relocated to:  00817000 0086EABD
avail ram:     00400000 00800000
Linux/PPC load: console=ttyS0,9600
Uncompressing Linux...done.
Now booting the kernel
and it freeze at this point.
i saw that this is an old problem with some systems,
but i did not find any working way to fix it.
kernel 2.2.11, but i tried 2.2.10 and 2.2.9.
looks like kernel confused about my computer
configuration and memory stuff.
ah, one more thing. i compiled it with cross-compiler
running on x86.
thanks in advance.
