More reason, that IF you find the performance impact high enough, you
should do it with a macro, that can be changed to adopt to the
currrent status of compiler, length of types etc etc.

Hmm. I'm not too familiar with the exact wording of ANSI. However,
they usually take the road where "more accuracy in intermediates is
allowed", as that can normally only reduce the amount of trouble that
you get into when things near the limit of the size you're using.

Is a compiler allowed to optimize
    a + 4 - 4 
into "a"?
There are "opposites" that can be taken together. So in principle:
	(a >> 4) << 4 == a
except that a few bits fall off at the binary point. 
Similarly we agree that 
	(a << 4) >> 4 == a
except that a few bits fall off at the high end. However, that's (as
you've demonstrated) dependent on the size of the intermediates
involved.
If you're right that a compiler may not extend the size of the
intermediates beyond the size of an unsiged int, the Alpha compiler
is in trouble, as it has to explicitly cater for this. Ints on Alpha
are 32 bits, but registers are 64 bits, so it will have to explicitly
clip the intermediate on:
	(a << 4) >> 4 
Usually, ANSI will take the road where the compiler writer is allowed
to optimize for the common case: More accuracy usually doesn't matter.
