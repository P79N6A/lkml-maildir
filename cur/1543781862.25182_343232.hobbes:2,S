Hi,
Adding the include to dmi.h allows the compile to get past this point though I
wonder if this is the correct place to put it?  (Thanks Benoit)
I now get:
  CC [M]  net/ipv4/ipvs/ip_vs_ctl.o
net/ipv4/ipvs/ip_vs_ctl.c:1601: error: static declaration of 'ipv4_table' follows non-static declaration
include/net/ip.h:376: error: previous declaration of 'ipv4_table' was here
make[3]: *** [net/ipv4/ipvs/ip_vs_ctl.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [net/ipv4/ipvs] Error 2
make[1]: *** [net/ipv4] Error 2
make: *** [net] Error 2
Ideas?
TIA
Ed Tomlinson
