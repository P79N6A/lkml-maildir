Without arguing that point, the VM also should have a solution
to the problem where people don't turn it off.

Well if nothing at all happens we don't swap out, but when something
is happening, desktop users don't want any of their programs to be
swapped out no matter how long they have been sitting idle. They don't
want to wait 10 seconds to page something in even if it means they're
waiting an extra 10 minutes throughout the day for their kernel greps
and diffs to finish.
