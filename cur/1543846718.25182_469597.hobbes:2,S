I'd like to propose that anyone adding __must_check markers in the
future be forced to *WRITE SOME FUCKING DOCUMENTATION* about exactly
what it is the caller is supposed to be checking.
extern int __must_check bus_register(struct bus_type * bus);
Why, thank you.  Does it return 0 for success, or 1 on success?  Does it
return an errno?
