I don't want give you the impression of a "evidently sensible answer",
(maybe ist was also a little bit late or early ... :-)
I only want to point out that here is a deeper design flaw in this code
and it is here for a long time, but the old none spinlock code
with a big CLI (bad,bad,bad) make it working well enough. During
porting I saw this problem, but forget to mark it for fixing later.
These things (missing separation of layers) was one reason for me to
begin a new driver from scratch some time ago (mISDN).
