The spinlock itself should protect the integrity of the
list. If a prev or next element in the list should be
removed, while in a discover function, then the prev
or next field in the current plugin will get updated,
but I don't believe that should cause the list_for_each_entry
macro problems traversing the remainding elements in the list.
The first instruction in every plugin's discover function
is a MOD_INC_USE_COUNT and the last before the return is
MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT. So there exists a small window by
which the current plugin might be unloaded between the
spinlock release and MOD_INC_USE_COUNT, and the
MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT and the spinlock reacquire.
We plan to register a "__this_module.can_unload()" that
should prevent plugin modules from unloading during
discovery.
