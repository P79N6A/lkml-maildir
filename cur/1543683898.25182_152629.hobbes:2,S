  Huh I see. Actually only old quota format is affected by this bug
(that may be a reason why it went unnoticed for a while).

  I'll have a look at this - I don't see a reason for this in a code.

  When you have test machine you usually don't run a quota on it and
when you have machine with lots of users on it you won't use unstable
kernels. So I guess this is not a big wonder (I suppose the bugreports
for 2.6 quota code will start to appear soon ;).
