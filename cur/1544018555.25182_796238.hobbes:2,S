But taking into account the constraints of this special case, namely
(1), we can't skip lock(wq->lock).
(1) "the next contender is us"
In this particular situation, we are only interested in the case when
we were woken up by __wake_up_bit().
that means we are _on_ the 'wq' list when we do finish_wait() -> we do
take the 'wq->lock'.
Moreover, imagine the following case (roughly similar to finish_wait()):
if (LOAD(a) == 1) {
    // do something here
    mb();
}
LOAD(b);
Can LOAD(b) be reordered with LOAD(a)?
I'd imagine that it can be done with CPUs that do execute 2 branch
paths in advance but then LOAD(b) must be re-loaded if (a == 1) and we
hit mb().
