Subject: typo in buffer_busy macro in fs/buffer.c ??

This looks like a typo:
(line 2341 of fs/buffer.c in unpatched 2.4.0
line 2345 of fs/buffer.c in 2.4.1-pre8)
#define buffer_busy(bh) (atomic_read(&(bh)->b_count) | ((bh)->b_state &
BUFFER_BUSY_BITS))
surely, it should be:
#define buffer_busy(bh) (atomic_read(&(bh)->b_count) || ((bh)->b_state &
BUFFER_BUSY_BITS))
i.e. logical OR instead of bitwise.
Shouldn't it?
