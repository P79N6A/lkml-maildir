Subject: [RFC][-rt PATCH] Try to safely error out when mixing pi/non-pi futex operations on the same futex.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Ingo,
	We've been seeing some oopses because there are waiters on pi futexes
that do not have pi_states. This seems to be because they were used w/
futex_wait in one path and futex_lock_pi in another. 
I'm told this shouldn't ever happen, but if it did, the kernel should
safely error out, instead of oopsing or never releasing a lock.
Not sure if this is a solid fix (it does build and boot), but hopefully
it will stir up some discussion.
thanks

Try to handle odd cases where a futex is used w/ both the pi and non-pi methods.
