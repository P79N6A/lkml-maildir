Hi,
I'm currently running a 2.6.19 kernel and 2 times out of 3 the sound driver fails to load hence probing me a no sound device available in KDE.
Once I reload the driver this output goes into the dmesg:
usbcore: deregistering interface driver snd-usb-audio
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [APCJ] enabled at IRQ 22
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:04.0[A] -> Link [APCJ] -> GSI 22 (level, low) -> IRQ 22
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:04.0 to 64
intel8x0_measure_ac97_clock: measured 51418 usecs
intel8x0: clocking to 46862
I've attached the dmesg and the lspci -vvv.
Could the snd-usb-audio interfere with the on-board sound driver?
