I'm glad to report that this unionfs, not the one in 2.6.24-rc2-mm1
but the one including those 9 patches you posted, now gets through
my testing with tmpfs without a problem.  I do still get occasional
"unionfs: new lower inode mtime (bindex=0, name=<directory>)"
messages, but nothing worse seen yet: a big improvement.
I deceived myself for a while that the danger of shmem_writepage
hitting its BUG_ON(entry->val) was dealt with too; but that's wrong,
I must go back to working out an escape from that one (despite never
seeing it).
I did think you could clean up the doubled set_page_dirtys,
but it's of no consequence.
