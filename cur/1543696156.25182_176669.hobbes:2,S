Hi,
I have two 3com 3c905C-TX NICs in my linux box.
I remember that mii-tool used to work.
Now, with 2.6.0-test9-bk8 it does not.
dns:~# mii-tool
SIOCGMIIPHY on 'eth0' failed: Operation not supported
SIOCGMIIPHY on 'eth1' failed: Operation not supported
no MII interfaces found
What might be going on here? Did we have any recent changes in this,
or maybe my software's outdated, or NICs broken ?
It's Debian Sarge.
