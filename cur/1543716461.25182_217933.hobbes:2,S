hi everyone,
im trying to get an adaptec 1210SA card working. I keep seeing "lost
interrupts". I'm trying to find a patch to correct it. I've tried 2.4.27
with libata patch and also 2.6.4 but both still have the same problem. I was
recently emailed an updated sata_sil.c from someone on this list to correct
the issues but I've since lost the file and email due to a hard disk crash.
Does anyone have a known working patch to correct the lost interrupt issues
with the sata_sil driver?
Thanks
