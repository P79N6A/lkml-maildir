Actually, we have more than one - the memory barriers are hidden in outX()
macros.

Sure, otherwise the controller just wouldn't work, and not only on alpha.
I never had any problems with IDE DMA on lx164 (which has exactly the same
IDE chip), but it was back in 2.3 or 2.4-test times...
Maybe something got broken since then - I could check this (if I find
a spare IDE drive).
