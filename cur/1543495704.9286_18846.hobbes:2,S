I wrote the fs/buffer.c changes in 2.2.8 that are causing so many
problems.  I'm debugging as fast as I can.  Here are some notes.
1. Don't run update with 2.2.8.  It's unnecessary and it's causing
filesystem corruption for some people.  This has to be a bug somewhere
else in the kernel; update is simply calling sync() every thirty
seconds.
2. If you want your disks to spin down, try mounting filesystems with
noatime.  I do not like the idea of postponing writes indefinitely at
all.
3. The appended patch should correct the buffer backlog problems
observed by Steve Willer.  It is NOT ready to go into the official
kernel, but I would appreciate any comments.  Versus 2.2.8; may need
slight adjustment to apply to 2.3.1pre.
4. Under some conditions, 2.2.8 will get stuck in unlink().  sysrq-P
indicates it's spinning forever in ext2_truncate.  The process that
called unlink() is un-interruptible and permanently in `R' state.
Other processes proceed.  Init can't reboot the system, but sysrq
will.  If you remount RO and sync first, the file systems come up
clean, with the file that caused the problem unlinked.  This may be
related to the filesystem corruption problems reported by Michael
Warfield.
5. The truncate problem is made *worse* by the appended patch: it goes
from sometimes happening to always happening when I run bonnie.  I
suspect a race of some kind in ext2/truncate.c.
6. I am not on linux-kernel except via a web archive.  Please, if you
have anything to say about buffer.c, mail me directly.
