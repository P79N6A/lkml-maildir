From our customers who are moving from other OS's to Linux,
and expect DPA support to be under Linux as well.

Which is fine and I accept the blame for.
This is something Wendy can change and fix.
I am explaining why they exist today and my
argument of why we need them to stay.
As it stands today, your requirement appears to be that she needs
to yank all diags ioctls and sysfs files before the driver can make
it into the kernel sources.
This is also fine, but Wendy and IBM will need to decide whether
all our diags utilties are needed for the JSM driver or not.
