I presume f_op->aio_readv could point to __generic_file_aio_read for most
filesystems.
Would f_op->aio_writev need a new wrapper function for 2.5.42 ?
f_op->aio_write eventually calls generic_file_write which uses a different inode
from generic_file_writev. So f_op->aio_writev might need to point to a function
like generic_file_writev but using the same inode as generic_file_write.

It would be interesting to see the performance boost when <iov length> events
are retrieved at once, using the min_nr parameter of io_getevents.
