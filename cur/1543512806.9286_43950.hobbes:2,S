I have a creative pci sound card in one of my machines.  the chip says
es1373 on it but the 1371 driver works for it.  Here's what mine says in
lspci -v
00:0b.0 Multimedia audio controller: Ensoniq ES1371 [AudioPCI-97] (rev 08)
        Subsystem: Unknown device 1274:1371

Does it look like this when loading the module (this came from dmesg):
es1371: version v0.13 time 21:24:41 Oct  4 1999
es1371: found adapter at io 0x6200 irq 9
es1371: features: joystick 0x0
es1371: codec vendor 
                      v revision 9
es1371: codec features 18bit DAC 18bit ADC
es1371: stereo enhancement: unknown
Be nice to know why it does that..  Anyway it works.
