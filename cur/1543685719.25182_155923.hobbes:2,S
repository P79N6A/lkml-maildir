   I had it occasionally in the 2.5.X series, as well as with 2.6.0-test2.
To me it seems like some apparently unrelated config setting causes this.
I'd go over the config again, change a few settings that seem to make
sense - but nothing obvious - then recompile and get a healthy kernel.
   I'm using Grub and ext3, for the record.
