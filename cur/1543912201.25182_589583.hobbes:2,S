i just tried something similar (by adding Option "NoDRI" to xorg.conf) 
and i'm wondering how it can be smooth on vesa-driver at all. I tested 
it on a Core2Duo box and software rendering manages to do about 3 frames 
per second. (although glxgears itself thinks it does ~600 fps) If i 
start 3 glxgears then they do ~1 frame per second each. This is on 
Fedora 7 with xorg-x11-server-Xorg-1.3.0.0-9.fc7 and 
xorg-x11-drv-i810-2.0.0-4.fc7.
