Subject: [PATCH 4/7] NLM: Initialize completion variable in lockd_up
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/18/172

lockd_start_done is a global var that can be reused if lockd is
restarted, but it's never reinitialized. On all but the first use,
wait_for_completion isn't actually waiting on it since it has
already completed once.
