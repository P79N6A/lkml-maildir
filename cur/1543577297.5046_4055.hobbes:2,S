Yep.

You are more or less correct.  I've looked a little bit at
the source and now understand a little bit better.  It turns
out that parts of the Cardbus code in the kernel source
includes code from the pcmcia_cs package.  The "cs:" messages
in the log are generated by this code.  I *think* this code
reads configuration files from /etc/pcmcia, but I haven't
found the place in the code that does it.  Anyhow, these
messages:
    cs: IO port probe 0x0c00-0x0cff: clean.
    cs: IO port probe 0x0800-0x08ff: clean.
    cs: IO port probe 0x0100-0x04ff: excluding 0x280-0x28f 0x378-0x37f 
   0x3a0-0x3a7 0x4d0-0x4d7
    cs: IO port probe 0x0a00-0x0aff: clean.
change when I modify /etc/pcmcia/config.opts.
The /etc/pcmcia/config* files get installed by the pcmcia_cs
package, so even when I am only using the cardbus functionality,
there seems to be some need to pcmcia_cs, since the config.opts
file contains "magic" good defaults numbers for safe irqs, ports
and memory ranges.
As I have already discussed with David Brownell, there is huge a
problem getting a usable cardbus solution with the current pcmcia_cs
package.  Even when I tell it I am using a 2.4.0 kernel and that
I want to use the development kernel's drivers, it maps loads of
device IDs to the pcmcia_cs drivers which don't exist in this
configuration!  For example, it maps the 3c575 device ID to
3c575_cb instead of 3c59x.

Well, I have no idea why the "arguments (pci) env (...)"
message wasn't emitted.  I do know that with the test12-pre5
kernel I get working hotplug for the BusPort Mobile.
Thanks for all your help!
