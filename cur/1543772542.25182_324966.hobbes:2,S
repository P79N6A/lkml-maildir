That would be nice (I'd like to see it in 2.6); I wrote it for two reasons:
   1) Because often the info you need has already scrolled off
    and because of the panic you can't scroll back.
   2) When talking to users on help channels the only thing they
     can normally tell you is the last 'failed to mount root' line
     and don't really no what to look back for, by having a
     few line summary you can more easily get someone to type out.
1) could be cured by not actually panic'ing.
