Can we move cpuinfo_x86 also to per cpu area? Though critical run
time code doesn't access this area, it will be nice to move the cpuinfo_x86
also into per cpu area.
Perhaps the current cpuinfo_x86 layout might cause confusion and make people
add arch specific per cpu elements into cpuinfo_x86(thinking that it uses per
cpu area).
Wonder if this confusion is the reason for git commit f3fa8ebc
thanks,
