Well, we used to be able to do that with netfilter but it had the  
same unfixable race conditions that you are presently running into  
and so such support was dropped by the netfilter folks.  I suspect if  
you CC'ed netdev@vger.kernel.org you would get some very precise  
reasons why such filtering doesn't work.
