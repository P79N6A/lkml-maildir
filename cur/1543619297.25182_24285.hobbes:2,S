Please see my other email on this subject (out of order BK CSETs).
One relatively easy solution is "proxy CSETs", which describe on a
per-line basis (or xdelta checksum boundaries, even better) the changes
made in "false parent" CSETs, but do not actually contain the changes.
This allows the reciever to resolve the false dependencies, and also
allows the sender to validate (at proxy CSET creation time) that the
out-of-order CSET they are about to send, in fact, does not depend on
any of the "false parent" CSETs.
Cheers, Andreas
