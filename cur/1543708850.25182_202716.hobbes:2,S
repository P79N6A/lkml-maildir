What I am describing does not have anything to do with gdb going away.  It is 
that in "normal" operation the console output is done with the interrupts on 
(i.e. we are not in kgdb as a result of a breakpoint, but only to do console 
output).  This means that the interrupt that is generated by the '+' from gdb 
may well happen and the kgdb interrupt handler will see the '+' and, with the 
interrupt handler changes, generate a breakpoint.  All we really want to do is 
to pass the '+' through to putpacket.  In a UP machine, I think the wait for the 
'+' is done with the interrupt system off, however, in an SMP machine, other 
cpus may see it and interrupt...  At the very least, the interrupt code needs to 
be able to determine that no character came in and ignore the interrupt.
