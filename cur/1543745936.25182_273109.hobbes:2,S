Nope, i don't see those. 
- my soundcard doesn't allow periodsizes > 512, so i ran with 512 now
- the xruns are very sporadic. My gnome desktop has a little toolbar thingy
which can hide all windows on a click and show em all again on the next
click. I _think_ there _might_ be a correlation to rapidly clicking that
hide/show all windows thing. But i'm not sure at all since it is not really
reproducable.
.config attached (29-4)
Will try 29-5 today (although my time might be limited due to some visitors)
