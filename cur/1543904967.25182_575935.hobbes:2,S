Ah, in that way. Yes, you right about that (though NCQ might help then?),
but that's true for all disk activity. Though I think swap prefetch didn't want
to run when there was CPU activity, so that would reduce the chance that
new IO is submitted right at that moment. I think in practice this isn't worth
worrying about, the real issue is the extra disk activity in the first place.
