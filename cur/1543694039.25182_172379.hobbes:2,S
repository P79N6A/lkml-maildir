We have standard macros for generating standard buffer_head operations, so
this can become
	set_buffer_ordered(bh);
See appended patch.

Why does the ordering go here?  I'd have thought that we only need to
enforce ordering around the commit block.
Touching the bh here after submitting it may be racy: may need to take an
extra ref against the bh to prevent it from disappearing.  I need to look
at it more closely.

shorts-in-structs worry me.  If the CPU implements a write-to-short as a
word-sized RMW and the compiler decides to align or pack the short into a
less-than-wored-sized storage space then a write-to-short could stomp on a
neighbouring member.
I doubt if it can happen, but if so, I'd be interested in knowing what guarantees it.

Similarly, I suspect that bitfields like this need locking.  If the CPU
implements a write-to-bitfield as a non-buslocked RMW it can stomp on
neighbouring bitfields in the same word.
