I believe that all bits are still available but are mostly inaccessible or undocumented.
Try to set some rather funny custom permissions on a file and view them using the cacls utility.
Rather worse they implemented some very ill logic e.g. you can delete a file with "Everyone:R" permissions when you are the owner.
I suspect that some hidden logic is required with ACLs and therefore prefer the rather hard to understand Un*x permissions.
