No, because "more" wouldn't have any capabilities in its "inheritable"
set, so it would NOT inherit any capabilities which its parents had.
This is why it's important for programs to by default have a null
inheritable set, and to only inherit capabilities if they have an
explicitly set of privileges which they are allowed to inherit.  This is
an integral part of the POSIX capabilities model.
The problem here is that some folks either don't understand the full
POSIX capaibility model, or keep trying to leave parts of it out in the
hopes of simplifying things.  The reality is that you really do need to
implement the full POSIX capability model for things to make sense.
