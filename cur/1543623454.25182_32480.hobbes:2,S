   What about memory for streaming mappings
That's a different story.
   I know pci_map_single (and _sg) will
   use bounce buffers on platforms without an IOMMU,
64-bit platforms without IOMMU use HIGHMEM.
   It could for example be solved with a GFP_32BIT flag or something (on IA64 I
   know GFP_DMA is used in pci_alloc_consistent() to get memory below 4GB but that
   can't be used on all platforms).
   
IA64 was broken, it now uses HIGHMEM.
   
Franks a lot,
