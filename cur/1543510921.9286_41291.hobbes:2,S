Good morning to everyone on the list.
Is anyone working with the Network Block Device driver (NBD) in
2.2.12.  If so what type of luck are you having.
I grabbed the tarball of userland stuff from Pavel's site and have it
up and running between a couple of SMP dual PII-450 systems.  I can
make a filesystem on the device and mount it and read/write files just
fine.
Problems seem to occur when the device gets subjected to large amounts
of I/O.  In these cases the throughput goes way, way done.  The
slowdown can be pretty easily demonstrated by running Bonnie with a
scratch filesize of 200-300 megabytes.
It smells like a client side (NBD) problem and it also appears to be a
Heisenbug.  When I turned on debugging in the server side utility the
stalls went away but throughput was than poor due to the massive
amounts of I/O being generated in the way of the debug information
being printed.
I would be interested in the experiences that anyone has had or if there
are a set of patches floating around which improve performance.
Thanks much and have a pleasant mid-week.
Greg
