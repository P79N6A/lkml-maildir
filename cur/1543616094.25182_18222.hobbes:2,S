What would you do with drivers with the same name (source code file)
in alsa and oss ?
Sound is special because you have two implementations of the same subsystem
living together. And eventually in a (near?) future, the oss subtree
will be killed and the alsa one would go up one level, just as is. Much
cleaner. And you will end with
sound/alsa-core.c
sound/drivers/alsa-driver.c
