Hi again.

Do you run anything that would shift the system's idea of what the
current time is? Programs such as ntpd and rdate spring to mind, but
I'm sure there are others.
The other way to look at this is to ask whether there were any system
time shifts whilst you were compiling the kernel. One way to find this
out would be to apply the following patch, then redo the make session:

When the make finishes, look through ~/makeme for any datestamps that
are out of order, then check /var/log/messages and see if there's
anything specific that was run at that time...
Best wishes from Riley.
