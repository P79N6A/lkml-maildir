(Cc'd Richard Henderson as resident gcc guru.)
We're discussing a way to get more information out of section mismatch
reports so that the causes of section mismatches are a little more
obvious.  I'd like to see something like:
foo() is marked __init at line 34
bar() calls foo() at line 57
Arjan points out that optimization may make this difficult; I'm happy
with a separate script running at a lower level of optimization that
you can run by hand when one of these warnings shows up.
Ideas?
