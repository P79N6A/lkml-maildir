Why take the easy road, ( :-) ),  and merely make the kernel
hot-swappable?  You could use the code from the User Mode Linux
project as a starting point for creating a Meta Kernel Mode linux
project, and run several more kernel images concurrently as user mode
processes of the top-level kernel, and then add necessary to connect
any particular physical hardware to the MKML virtual machines.
Then, you could migrate your applications from kernel to kernel
without ever having to re-boot.
Mainframe power on the desktop :-)
John.
