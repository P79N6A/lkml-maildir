Just had a try of doing things like updatedb and dd if=/dev/zero of=./blah
It is pretty swappy I guess. The following patch I think makes things less
swappy. It still isn't true dropbehind because new unmapped pages still do
place some pressure on the more established pagecache, but not as much.
It is unclear whether full dropbehind is actually good or not. If you have
512MB of memory and a 256MB working set of file data (unmapped), with 400MB
of mapped memory doing nothing, after enough thrashing through your 256MB,
you'd expect some of that mapped memory to be swapped out.
By the way, I would be interested to know the rationale behind
mark_page_accessed as it is without this patch, also what is it doing in
rmap.c (I know hardly anything actually uses page_test_and_clear_young, but
still). It seems to me like it only serves to make VM behaviour harder to
understand, but I'm probably missing something. Andrew?
