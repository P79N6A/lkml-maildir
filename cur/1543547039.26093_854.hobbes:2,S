Yep, now why do you like behavior that interacts with
all three? This is some sort of S&M problem you have?

No shit. "something you have to live with" You live with the
namespace flag being a special case everywhere, because it is
a backwards bit.
In case it isn't obvious yet, I'm NOT suggesting fork() change.
The comment was part of my argument for the namespace issue
being a reasonable exception to the unshare(~0) behavior.

Um, the point is you break mount(8) just by adding namespaces.
The /var/mail filesystem dies, so the admin unmounts it and
mounts a new disk... all the users, in login-enforced namespaces,
continue to see the corrupt filesystem.
So you need some hackery to make mount(8) cause change in all
namespaces at once. Whatever is done, this will be gross.
I suppose you'd require a loopback of some sort, so that one
might rip the real filesystem out from under /var/mail instead
of trying to unmount it in 50 different namespaces... ugh.

The explanation still sucks quite severely. The personality and
setuid problems are particulary gross, because they depend on
what executable is being started. Behavior changes drasticly when
one merely recompiles with an alternate personality.
If you simply unshare on exec, all this special-case crap goes away.
The "kill other threads" option also has this nice property, and the
"let user shoot foot" option only suffers from the setuid wart.
