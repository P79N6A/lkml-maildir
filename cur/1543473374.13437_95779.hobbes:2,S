However, one of the terms of the license is that as an author, you can specify
which version of the license you want to apply.  It is only in the case where
you do not specify a version that the recipient can choose which version to use.
If, in your code, you specify that it can be used only under version 2 of the
GPL, then any hypothetical changes made to future versions of the license
would not affect your code.
So it doesn't matter whether he would 'do something like that'.  It's
irrelevant.
