This is the one I have been talking about:
XFree86 Version 4.3.0
Release Date: 27 February 2003
X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0, Release 6.6
Build Operating System: Linux 2.4.21-0.13mdksmp i686 [ELF] 
I also tried the gears test just now on this:
X Window System Version 6.8.1
Release Date: 17 September 2004
X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0, Release 6.8.1
Build Operating System: Linux 2.6.9-1.860_ELsmp i686 [ELF] 
but it completely locks up.  Disabling add_wait_runtime seems to fix it.
Thanks!
