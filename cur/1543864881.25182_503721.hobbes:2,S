there is precisely /zero/ contention on the clocksource_lock! It is a 
very short-held lock, and it's only held by the timer interrupt and some 
really rare operations like 'clocksource register' or 'show 
clocksources'.

I think you didnt understand what i said: the point is to /remove/ the 
polling, and to replace it with a natural lock that is held anyway: 
xtime_lock or whatever other exclusion mechanism. Again, there is almost 
/never/ any contention on this lock so there's no 'latency to add'. But 
the polling overhead in every timer irq, even if it's just a single 
atomic flag, does add up in every timer tick.
you also didnt seem to understand my other point:

that is actually more important from a design cleanliness POV than the 
basic avoidance of some polling overhead.
