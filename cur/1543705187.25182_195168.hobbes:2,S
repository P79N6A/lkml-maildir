No problem. I already tested it. After throwing out usb modules, it did 
suspend, though taking quite long at the kernel and processing 
(something like that) message. But upon restart, it didn't resume, ie. 
it didn't find its image, just normal swap space.
I compiled into kernel /dev/hde5 and put resume2=swap:/dev/hde5 into 
kernel paramters at grung.conf. Shouldn't that work?
bye,
Prakash
