I can't see a way to query how long of cmap the device supports using
the current fbdev ioctls.
I wouldn't even be messing with cmap except for the true/direct color
support and gamma ramps. Don't I need to know how long the cmap is in
order to set the right gamma ramp?
If I set a 256 entry gamma ramp on a card with 1024 entries, will it
still work right? Or do I need to set all 1024 entries?
