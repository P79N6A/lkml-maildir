Subject: drivers/acpi/scan.c: inconsequent NULL handling

The Coverity checker found the following:
<--  snip  -->
static int
acpi_bus_match (
        struct acpi_device      *device,
        struct acpi_driver      *driver)
{
        if (driver && driver->ops.match)
                return driver->ops.match(device, driver);
        return acpi_match_ids(device, driver->ids);
}
<--  snip  -->
Either driver can be NULL, in which case the driver->ids is a possible 
NULL pointer reference, or it can't, in which case the check whether 
it's NULL is superfluous.
