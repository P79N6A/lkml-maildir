Right, last night the server crashed when running 'expire' (that's
the news server's database update/purge) without anything in the
logs.
The time it ran before that it had significantly less throughput
than 2.4.19 has.
I'd love to tinker with this some more, reproduce the crash,
finetune the throughput, but it is a production server and
I can't keep on letting it crash during the night.
Maybe I'll try once more next week, with a telnet to the
console server in a 'screen' session so I can capture the
panic. Right now I have to lay low for a while, hiding
from my collegues ;)
Mike.
