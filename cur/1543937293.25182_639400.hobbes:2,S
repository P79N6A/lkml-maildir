I thought it was "don't use /proc for new things that aren't process
related".
And as the mount table is per process......
A host has a bunch of mounted filesystems (struct super_block), and
each process has some subset of these stitched together into a mount
tree (struct vfsmount / struct namespace).
There needs to be something in /proc that exposes the vfsmount tree.
Arguably there should be something else - maybe in sysfs - that
provides access to the "struct superblock" object.
And there needs to be a clear way to relate information from one with
information from the other.
In the tradition of stat, statm, status, maybe the former should be
 /proc/$PID/mountm
:-)
Hey, I just found /proc/X/mountstats.  How does this fit in to the big
picture?
