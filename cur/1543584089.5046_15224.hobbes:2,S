It CAN and IS causing oopses. init_etherdev() causes /sbin/hotplug to be
invoked, which in turn ifconfig up's the interface.
Several (if not all) drivers have an _up() function which cannot handle 
not-yet initialized device nodes.
Now we don't see this often as on UP systems, /sbin/hotplug is only started
_after_ the probe function either sleeps or exits, and 95% of the probe
functions don't sleep. (The ones that do are indeed reported to oops)
For SMP systems, I guess not that many have cardbus or other hotplug NICs....
