I also have an HP Omnibook 4150 (model F1629N, PII 300 MHz and Neomagic
NM2200 card) and I have similar problems (if I try to load the agpgart
module it locks up the machine). Some time ago I did a bit of debugging
and I arrived to the conclusion that the BIOS does not initialize the
base of the aperture table (that can be seen by reading the APBASE
register of the PCI AGP controller or by doing "lspci -v" and seeing
that the memory is unassigned). That locks up the system whenever AGP is
enabled by the agpgart module (will try to access memory at 0x0).
Have you ever managed to get agpgart working on the OB 4150? If yes,
which exact model and with which BIOS on which kernel?
I'm using BIOS 2.28 and running kernel 2.4.9-13 (RedHat 7.2).
Relevant lspci data is:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 440BX/ZX - 82443BX/ZX Host bridge
(rev 02)
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64
	Memory at <unassigned> (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=64M]
	Capabilities: [a0] AGP version 1.0
00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 440BX/ZX - 82443BX/ZX AGP bridge
(rev 02) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])
	Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 128
	Bus: primary=00, secondary=01, subordinate=01, sec-latency=64
	Memory behind bridge: fe700000-fecfffff
	Prefetchable memory behind bridge: fd000000-fe3fffff
As you can see, 00:00.0 has the memory unassigned. I guess the BIOS
should set that up.
Any feedback very much appreciated!
Diego
