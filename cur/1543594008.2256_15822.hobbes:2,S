Or you could keep your hardware and try the Intel driver, which seems to 
work fine.  It only works as a module, though.  This might also help 
narrow the issue to a driver vs. card vs. mobo/BIOS/IRQ/APIC/etc issue.
Personally, I've found the EtherExpress hardware and eepro100 driver to 
be flawless in production on both single and dual units, card and 
built-in.  It's the first choice for Linux now that Tulip has somewhat 
faded from view, AFAIC.  I have heard mentioned on this list that the 
Intel driver is necessary for some (older?) cards, however.
OT: does anyone know what the current state of the Tulip driver is and 
if there is good hardware out there?  SMC left Tulip and went through at 
least two other chipsets, so the only Tulip card I could find as of a 
couple of years ago was Digital's.  But it was astonishingly expensive 
and not clearly supported by the Linux driver.
Thanks,
