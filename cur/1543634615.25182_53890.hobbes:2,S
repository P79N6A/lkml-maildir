Dear Kernel Hackers,
I am running kernel 2.4.19-pre10. I am experiencing a problem with my 
internal ATAPI Zip 100 Drive. Currently I am using the ide-floppy 
driver. The device is attached to my secondry slave (/dev/hdd). Whenever 
I try to do any I/O, my system eventually comes to a full stop. I 
managed to extract the following kernel log messages.
Jun 21 01:17:09 hori kernel: ide-scsi: CoD != 0 in idescsi_pc_intr
Jun 21 01:17:09 hori kernel: hdd: ATAPI reset complete
Jun 21 01:17:09 hori kernel: hdd: lost interrupt
Jun 21 01:17:09 hori kernel: ide-scsi: CoD != 0 in idescsi_pc_intr
Jun 21 01:17:09 hori kernel: hdd: ATAPI reset complete
Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: hdd: lost interrupt
Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: ide-scsi: CoD != 0 in idescsi_pc_intr
Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : 
pid 4498, scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 Write (10) 00 00 00 00 df 00 00

Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: SCSI host 0 abort (pid 4498) timed out - 
resetting
Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout :

Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: SCSI host 0 abort (pid 4499) timed out - 
resetting
Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: hdd: ATAPI reset complete
Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: hdd: lost interrupt
Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: ide-scsi: CoD != 0 in idescsi_pc_intr
Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: hdd: ATAPI reset complete
Jun 21 01:17:11 hori kernel: hdd: lost interrupt
Jun 22 02:18:04 hori syslogd 1.4.1: restart.
These messages keep repeating itself until forever.
I also tried to use the ide-scsi driver instead, but I am running into 
the same problem. Is this a known bug in the latest stable kernel or am 
I having a bad hardware ?
Thank You,
Emre
