Hmm? I am not aware of such a constraint.
It's not very invasive anyways in that it would require changing
a lot of code.

The actual x86-64 kernel is actually quite stable, most of the reported
problems (including yours) come from various hardware or firmware
issues mostly in new platforms. If you use a trusty old chipset
(e.g. AMD 8111 or Intel E7505) and proven motherboard you're usually ok.
