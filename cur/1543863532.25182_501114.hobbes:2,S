Subject: [patch] scsi: use lock per host instead of per device for shared queue tag host
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The block layer uses lock to protect request queue. Every scsi device
has a unique request queue, and queue lock is the default lock in struct
request_queue. This is good for normal cases. But for a  host with
shared queue tag (e.g. stex controllers), a queue lock per device means
the shared queue tag is not protected when multiple devices are accessed
at a same time.  This patch is a simple fix for this situation by introducing
a host queue lock to protect shared queue tag. Without this patch we will
see various kernel panics (including the BUG() and kernel errors in
blk_queue_start_tag and blk_queue_end_tag of ll_rw_blk.c) when accessing
different devices simultaneously (e.g. copying big file from one device to
another in smp kernels).
This is against kernel 2.6.20-rc5.
