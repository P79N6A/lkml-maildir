	It was a remnant from the old aironet4500 driver that was
removed during 2.5.X. It was also confusing because there is a file
called drivers/net/wireless/ieee802_11.h that has a somewhat similar
purpose and is used in various drivers (Orinoco, Atmel). I think it
was discussed on netdev.
	I was not aware that IPW2100 was using it. I could not try
this driver because it doesn't compile with gcc 2.95.

	Well, Jeff explicitely said that we should not care about
drivers outside the kernel ;-)
	Seriously, I see three solutions :
	1) Convert ipw2100 to using drivers/net/wireless/ieee802_11.h,
extend this header as necessary
	2) Have ipw2100 use a private version of 802_11.h
	3) Convince us that this file is really needed (good luck)
	Obviously (1) is better in the long term.
	Have fun...
	Jean
