No, pci_map_single is a fine interface.  What is lacking is a
"INVALID_DMA_ADDR" define for each platform, and I've known about
this for some time.
But for the time being, everyone assumes address zero is not valid and
it shouldn't be too painful to reserve the first page of DMA space
until we fix this issue.
