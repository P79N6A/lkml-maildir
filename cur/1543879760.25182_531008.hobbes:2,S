to debug this, could you try to apply this add-on as well:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/cfs-scheduler/sched-fair-print.patch
with this patch applied you should have a /proc/sched_debug file that 
prints all runnable tasks and other interesting info from the runqueue. 
[ i've refreshed all the patches on the CFS webpage, so if this doesnt 
  apply cleanly to your current tree then you'll probably have to 
  refresh one of the patches.]
The output should look like this:
 Sched Debug Version: v0.01
 now at 226761724575 nsecs
 cpu: 0
   .nr_running            : 3
   .raw_weighted_load     : 384
   .nr_switches           : 13666
   .nr_uninterruptible    : 0
   .next_balance          : 4294947416
   .curr->pid             : 2179
   .rq_clock              : 241337421233
   .fair_clock            : 7503791206
   .wait_runtime          : 2269918379
 runnable tasks:
            task | PID | tree-key |   -delta |  waiting | switches
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 +            cat  2179 7501930066   -1861140    1861140         2
      loop_silent  2149 7503010354    -780852          0       911
      loop_silent  2148 7503510048    -281158     280753       918
now for your workload the list should be considerably larger. If there's 
starvation going on then the 'switches' field (number of context 
switches) of one of the tasks would never increase while you have this 
'cannot switch consoles' problem.
maybe you'll have to unapply the fair-fork patch to make it trigger 
again. (fair-fork does not fix anything, so it probably just hides a 
real bug.)
(i'm meanwhile busy running your scheddos utilities to reproduce it 
locally as well :)
