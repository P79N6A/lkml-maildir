Hallo,
I have a problem compiling the kernel 2.4.19.
The running kernel is linux-2.4.10.SuSE.
The packed file was from www.kernel.org; I have unzipped it into 
/usr/src/linux-2.4.19 and made a new symbolic link /usr/linux to it.
Then I have run make xconfig and saved the configuration.
Now the problem:
vongrillo:/usr/src/linux # make dep
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o scripts/mkdep 
scripts/mkdep.c
In file included from /usr/include/bits/posix1_lim.h:126,
                 from /usr/include/limits.h:144,
                 from 
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-suse-linux/2.95.3/include/limits.h:117,
                 from 
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-suse-linux/2.95.3/include/syslimits.h:7,
                 from 
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-suse-linux/2.95.3/include/limits.h:11,
                 from scripts/mkdep.c:35:
/usr/include/bits/local_lim.h:36: linux/limits.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [scripts/mkdep] Error 1
In the directory /usr/linux is now such file. And I have found more than 1 
file "limits.h".
Which file "limits.h" is the right?
Best regards
RvG
