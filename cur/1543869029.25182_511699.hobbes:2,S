I am not surprised that remove_arg_zero() is buggy.  Let us look at the
stupid thing:
void remove_arg_zero(struct linux_binprm *bprm)
{
	if (bprm->argc) {
		unsigned long offset;
		char * kaddr;
		struct page *page;
		offset = bprm->p % PAGE_SIZE;
		goto inside;
		while (bprm->p++, *(kaddr+offset++)) {
			if (offset != PAGE_SIZE)
				continue;
			offset = 0;
			kunmap_atomic(kaddr, KM_USER0);
inside:
			page = bprm->page[bprm->p/PAGE_SIZE];
			kaddr = kmap_atomic(page, KM_USER0);
		}
		kunmap_atomic(kaddr, KM_USER0);
		bprm->argc--;
	}
}
I mean.... what the hell?
As you appear to have managed to work out what the sorry thing is trying to
do, would you have time to simply rip it out and completely rewrite it,
including a nice comment telling the world what this function's function is?
Because what we have there is beyond repairing.
Thanks.
