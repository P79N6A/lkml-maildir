 hello all,
    on a server i administrate we have two pci cards - one is DECtupis and
 the other VIA-rhino. on the boot up, the monolithic kernel detects both
 of the cards (it's given parameters from the lilo). the problem i have is
 how can i _force_ the kernel or drivers to accept the order in which i
 want them.  
    for example if the append line in /etc/lilo.conf contains
 "ether=5,0xd000,eth0 ether=12,0xb800,eth1" i expect the cards to be in just
 this order. however, the via-rhino driver is run first and thus it gets
 eth0 and not eth1 as i wanted it.
    why are the parameters given to kernel ignored?
 p.s: i tried on 2.2.x and 2.0.3x
	thanks,
