That's correct for the majority of modern IDE disks.

I fail to see the point of this discussion.  What is the point in
marking sectors bad at the filesystem level, when the drive is
supposed to be doing it at the firmware level?
The drive is probably full of unusable areas, which are correctly
identified and not used by the firmware.  One more is detected, and
the firmware doesn't cope with it.  Suddenly we are getting
suggestions to work around that in the filesystem.
The drive may well have been developing faults regularly through it's
entire lifetime, and you haven't noticed.  Now you have noticed and
want to work around the problem, but why wouldn't the drive continue
it's 'natural decay', and assuming it does, why would it be able to
re-map future bad blocks, but not this one?
Working around the problem in the filesystem makes no sense at all on
a modern IDE drive.
