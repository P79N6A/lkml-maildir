To be clear this change has exists for a very long time, long before
Thomas implemented it ..

Alright .. Later on I talk about clock frequency recalculation which

It's a bisect artifact .. It's eventually dropped in a latter patch .

The information passing was purposefully dropped .. It was used (in
part) to recalculate the frequency of a clock , but after discussing it
with John he suggested we drop the frequency recalculation entirely. So
the information passing should no longer be needed.
