I do but it only doesn't use pci_register_driver because that doesn't
work.  
The driver is a mtd map driver.  It knows there is a rom chip behind 
a pci->isa bridge.  And it needs to find the pci->isa bridge to
properly set it up to access the rom chip (enable writes and the
like).  
It isn't a driver for the pci->isa bridge, (I'm not even certain we
have a good model for that).  So it does not use pci_register_driver.
If you can give me a good proposal for how to accomplish that kind of
functionality I would be happy to use the appropriate
xxx_register_driver.
