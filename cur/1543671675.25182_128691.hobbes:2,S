Hi; FWIW, I've got an Inspiron 4000 running 2.5.68.  Neither
/proc/sys/cpu/0/speed nor /proc/cpufreq all me to change any values
(speed has min==max==0, `cat cpufreq` lists no parameters).  `cat i8k`
works, causing no such lock.  I don't use suspend/resume.  The screen
brightness buttons work and do not hang.  ACPI kind of works;
`cat BAT0/info` causes "Error: ul_allocate: Attempt to allocate zero bytes".
The same occurs when I reinsert the battery.

PS: I can confirm that /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state works; I just
sshed in to check.
