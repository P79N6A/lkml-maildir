Indeed, and thank you for getting this right!
Btw, is it possible to add dirent->d_type information to reiserfs, and
would there be any performance gain in doing so?
I have code to add d_type for every other filesystem that can support it
without additional disk reads, but I couldn't figure out whether
reiserfs can do it or whether stat() following readdir() is cheap anyway.
