Hi Pierre,
The platform bus does not show the actual physical relationship either.  For
x86, ACPI is typically needed to determine this. It would be easy to bind to
spawn pnp devices off of an ISA bridge device, attached to the pci bus, but
whether it's the actual physical parent would be very difficult to determine
without firmware assistance.
At the moment the pnp bus is only showing a logical bus relationship.  If we
were to use ACPI to aid in the generation of the physical device tree, we
could put these devices in the correct physical location.
Thanks,
Adam

It's normal for ISA devices to not tell us much about their physical
properties.
