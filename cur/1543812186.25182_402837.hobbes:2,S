Actually, that's has been the rule ever since the cardbus days: 
resources -- bars and irqs -- should not be considered allocated until 
after pci_enable_device().
Documentation/pci.txt reflects this reality as well:

Any PCI driver that presumes -anything- about resources before calling 
pci_enable_device() is buggy, and that's been the case for many years. 
Some platform-specific PCI drivers violate this with special knowledge, 
but overall that's the rule.
