i meant old tools. sorry.
will old tools work with kernel+nfs patches? i think the fear and
main argument against updating NFS in linux 2.2 is that people will
be forced to update their tools.
(however to that arg i say: anybody who uses NFS for any half serious
purpose will already have patched up, or is using a dist kernel with
patches).
