It allows you to register interfaces from user space.
As to IDE_ARCH_OBOSOLETE_INIT, its a red herring. It's not worth the
trouble to avoid it given the expected short remaining life time of the
old IDE layer. Far better would be to help get the new SATA layer doing
PATA so drivers/ide can be deleted.

In the ideal world - its a historical inheritance that its not dynamic -
you probably should set it to 10 though - just for plug in IDE cards.
