I have rebuild the kernel several times to check if I can get my kernel 
running with SMB like Kieran, but no luck up to now.
I found following Warning which concerns me:
[...]
  CC      fs/smbfs/inode.o
fs/smbfs/inode.c: In function `smb_fill_super':
fs/smbfs/inode.c:554: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range 
of data type
fs/smbfs/inode.c:555: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range 
of data type
  CC      fs/smbfs/file.o
  CC      fs/smbfs/ioctl.o
  CC      fs/smbfs/getopt.o
  CC      fs/smbfs/symlink.o
  CC      fs/smbfs/smbiod.o
  CC      fs/smbfs/request.o
  LD      fs/smbfs/smbfs.o
  LD      fs/smbfs/built-in.o
[...]
Please help me ... even if you just know who I should ask in that question.
cheers,
daniel
