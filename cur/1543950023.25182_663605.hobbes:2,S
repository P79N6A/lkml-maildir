It started out as a SLUB regression that was exposing poor code in the
percpu allocator due to different SLUB kmalloc alignments. That prompted
some further investigation about the alignment handling in the
allocators and showed up this problem with SLUB's HWCACHE_ALIGN. While
I don't know of a regression caused by it as such, it is totally
unreasonable to just change the semantics of it (seemingly for no good
reason). It is used quite a bit in networking for one, and those guys
count every single cache miss in their fastpaths.

The SMP flag was just an RFC. I think some people (like Christoph) were
being confused about the HWCACHE_ALIGN flag being for avoiding false
sharing on SMP systems. It would actually be also generally useful to
have the SMP flag (eg. see the sites I added it to in patch #3).
