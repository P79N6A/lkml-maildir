John,
You should first apply your own advice to yourself. Annoying everyone
with the exact same mail 10 times a day is really disserving to the
cause you pretend to defend. Please stop tainting reiser4's reputation,
because I suspect that it can do far more things than what you make it
look like. Its developers certainly need useful reports instead of a
mentally deficient's rant.
Now please call the nurse for your injection and go back to bed.
Thank you in advance,
Willy
