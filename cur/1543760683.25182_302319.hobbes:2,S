I agree.  Still in all that follows, no one has addressed the apparent race 
described above.  The reason the system reported the errors that started this 
thread is that the APM restore code was trying to read the cmos clock (I assume 
to set the xtime clock) WHILE the timer interrupt code what trying to set the 
cmos clock from xtime.  In other words, it is destroying the time it is trying 
to read.  I repeat "Possibly the APM code should change time_status to 
STA_UNSYNC on the way into the sleep."  I am not sure how ntp is supposed to 
react to the resume but I suspect that the system time is rather out of sync...
