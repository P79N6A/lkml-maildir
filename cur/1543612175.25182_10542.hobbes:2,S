Remember the pci_fixup_via_athlon_bug() (AKA "Athlon bug stomper")
function which went into kernel 2.4.14 after much discussion?
Apparently the mysterious register 55 in the Northbridge controls a
buggy Memory Write Queue timer. They finally acknowledged the problem
when Nvidia drivers and Windows XP started pushing the hardware enough
to trigger the bug...
