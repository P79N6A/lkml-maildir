Both 4-wire and 5-wire resistive touchscreens work as voltage dividers.
Thus the chip doesn't have to care about the total resistance, it just
applies voltage on two wires and the voltage on the other two
corresponds proportionally to the position. That's one axis measurement.
For the other axis, the role of the wires is simply swapped.
For capacitive touch sensors it's very much different, and the
controller usually is matched to the sensor, since the sensor usually has
several electrodes, so the controller 'knows' about the sensor because
they were manufactured together.
Regarding surface wave sensors, I'm not completely sure about the need
of calibration to get the range there. I'd assume that since they
measure wave reflections from reflector fins, and they know the number
of the fins (== number of reflections), that they'll be able to stretch
the range properly as well.

You'll need a new touchscreen most likely. The hammer will break the
glass if you hit it properly, and if the citric acid gets between the
resistive layers, you get nonlinear distortion of the resistivity and
that cannot be calibrated for.
