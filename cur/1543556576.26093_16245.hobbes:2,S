Well, after having no time for a coule of days, back to business ;))
I've downloaded + applied the ftp-multi patch and recompiled the modules.
then loaded them with ports=21,41,42,62,63, which works (well, no
errors/warnings...).
Then trying the application for which i needed it: doesn't work ;((
Are there maybe some major/crucial differences between the 2.2.x version
(which works) of ip_masq_ftp and the 2.4.x version of ip_nat_ftp ??
Cheers,
Taco.
