Ahhh...
From the trace, I see a bunch of "userspace" lines appearing.
And sure enough, something called "powernowd" is running,
and probably conflicting with the "ondemand" governor.
I'm nuking powernowd, and that'll probably cure it for this box.
I guess the distro (kubuntu) must have started "powernowd"
even though I told it (the distro) to use "ondemand".
Does it make sense that this could change the upper limit, though?
Thanks guys!
