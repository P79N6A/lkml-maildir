Why? sys_shmat is not a system call. Or at least there is a comment just 
before the implementation that this is not a syscall.
I think either the asmlinkage or the comment are wrong:
/*
 * Fix shmaddr, allocate descriptor, map shm, add attach descriptor to 
lists.
 *
 * NOTE! Despite the name, this is NOT a direct system call entrypoint. The

I'd propose to remove the asmlinkage and to move the prototype (without 
asmlinkage) back from syscalls.h to shm.h - what do you think?
