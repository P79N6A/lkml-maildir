-eCryptfs: A stacked cryptographic filesystem for Linux
-
-eCryptfs is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.
-For documentation, please see the files in the doc/ subdirectory.  For
-building and installation instructions please see the INSTALL file.
-
-Maintainer: Phillip Hellewell
-Lead developer: Michael A. Halcrow <mhalcrow@us.ibm.com>
-Developers: Michael C. Thompson
-            Kent Yoder
-Web Site: 
http://ecryptfs.sf.net
-
-This software is currently undergoing development. Make sure to
-maintain a backup copy of any data you write into eCryptfs.
-
-eCryptfs requires the userspace tools downloadable from the
-SourceForge site:
-
-
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ecryptfs/
-
-Userspace requirements include:
- - David Howells' userspace keyring headers and libraries (version
-   1.0 or higher), obtainable from
-   
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/keyutils/
- - Libgcrypt
-
-
-NOTES
-
-In the beta/experimental releases of eCryptfs, when you upgrade
-eCryptfs, you should copy the files to an unencrypted location and
-then copy the files back into the new eCryptfs mount to migrate the
-files.
-
-
-MOUNT-WIDE PASSPHRASE
-
-Create a new directory into which eCryptfs will write its encrypted
-files (i.e., /root/crypt).  Then, create the mount point directory
-(i.e., /mnt/crypt).  Now it's time to mount eCryptfs:
-
-mount -t ecryptfs /root/crypt /mnt/crypt
-
-You should be prompted for a passphrase and a salt (the salt may be
-blank).
-
-Try writing a new file:
-
-echo "Hello, World" > /mnt/crypt/hello.txt
-
-The operation will complete.  Notice that there is a new file in
-/root/crypt that is at least 12288 bytes in size (depending on your
-host page size).  This is the encrypted underlying file for what you
-just wrote.  To test reading, from start to finish, you need to clear
-the user session keyring:
-
-keyctl clear @u
-
-Then umount /mnt/crypt and mount again per the instructions given
-above.
-
-cat /mnt/crypt/hello.txt
-
-
-NOTES
-
-eCryptfs version 0.1 should only be mounted on (1) empty directories
-or (2) directories containing files only created by eCryptfs. If you
-mount a directory that has pre-existing files not created by eCryptfs,
-then behavior is undefined. Do not run eCryptfs in higher verbosity
-levels unless you are doing so for the sole purpose of debugging or
-development, since secret values will be written out to the system log
-in that case.
