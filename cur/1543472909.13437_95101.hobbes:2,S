Hi!
I'm just running 2.1.131 in 24 (32) bit mode (text console)
on vesafb, S3 Virge/DX in 800x600. ~8 pixels below the last
line of text I can see a horizontal line starting at the
left monitor border and ending at the 9 1/2 th text column.
The card was initialized to VBE 2.0 using the S3VBE20.exe;
800x600 works under Windows; also with the S3 vesa mode
configuration program I do not see this line in 800x600.
I don't care, I just noticed that. Typical case of a SEP.
ciao,
johnny
