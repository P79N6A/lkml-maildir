metoo.  I'm really struggling to recall an occasion on which the NMI
watchdog helped diagnose or fix a bug.  The usual scenario nowadays is that
I ask a reporter to enable NMI watchdog and for various reasons (mostly
mysterious) no useful information comes of it.
If it's causing machines to go down then the current tradeoff doesn't seem
right.
But _is_ it causing machines to go down, after the ACPI fix?
(the patch doesn't vaguely apply btw).
