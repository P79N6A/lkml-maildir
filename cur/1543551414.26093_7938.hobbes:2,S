Back?
Sorry, this is a production system of a customer I cannot just update to a
completely new kernel possibly sacrificing all startup scripts /system
utilities and rather complex firewall setup.  I'll see what I can do
though. 
Compiling and running 2.4.0 is not the problem, I just don't know if it
will work with the 2.2.14 system utilities and libc (I had bad experiences
with such things in the past)
