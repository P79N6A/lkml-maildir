Then i'm beginning to agree with the time unit... Large timeslice but in
units for high pri tasks... So that high pri can run (if needed) 2 or 3
times / timeslice.
More like MAX_QUANT_ON_QUEUE/MIN_QUANT or so...

Just sounds odd to me.

So it's penalised by being in the corner for one go? or just pri
penalised (sounds like it could get a corner from what you wrote... Or
is it time for bed).

Yes, but how many runable tasks would you have on a system in one go,
while maintaining interactivity...
(Ie, what amount would the scheduler actually have to deal with..)

Yeah, it seems like my idea would need several run queues with diff
timeslices to make up.

Yes, like the feedback scheduler...

nicevalues/pri is always the best way imho.

Yes, But... When you come from AmigaOS, and have used Executive...
things like this is dis concerning. Executive is a scheduler addition
for amigaos that has many schedulers to choose from. One of which is the
original feedback scheduler. While a feedback scheduler consumes some
cpu it still allows you to play mp3's while surfing the net on a 50 mhz
68060. Hearing about 500mhz machines that skip is somewhat.. odd.
And afair it has no real interactivity estimator. 
(If you are interested you can always search for Executive on aminet..
It has several scheduler policies including those that work great on
small machines (25mhz or so))

Apparently they are not... I should have saved the link...

I dunno, i didn't pay that much attention and i can't find it now =P

Well, there is latency and there is latency. To take the AmigaOS
example. Voyager, a webbrowser for AmigaOS uses MUI (a fully dynamic gui
with weighted(prioritized) sections) and renders images. It's responsive
even on a 40mhz 68040 using Executive with the feedback scheduler.
500 mhz is a lot of horsepower when it comes to playing mp3's and
scheduling.. It feels like something is wrong when i see all these
discussions but i most certainly don't know enough to even begin to
understand it. I only tried to show the thing i thought was really wrong
but you do have a point with the runqueues and timeslices =P
> They just need a scheduling boost.
imho, that shouldn't really be needed... =P
(although executive apparently had a pri boost for active window... I
doubt that i ran with it though... Been a while =))
