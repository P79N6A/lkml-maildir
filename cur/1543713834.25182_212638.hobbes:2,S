I agree, this is the appropriate behavior.  When "dd conv=direct" is
used on a fd that cannot support direct I/O, and the kernel doesn't tell
us until it's too late, erroring on the I/O is the only sane action.
Fortuitously, that's what happens with the patches I posted.
(Note that it's a function of the kernel and the underlying FS whether
direct I/O is going to work.  So some kind of heuristic on kernel
version is a bad idea.)

The Solaris semantics are more sane than the Linux ones, to be sure --
it always does the I/O, falling back to buffered I/O if conditions are
not right for direct.
I don't believe I have a test system for the Solaris case (when was
directio(3C) added?) so someone else will have to add that support.
