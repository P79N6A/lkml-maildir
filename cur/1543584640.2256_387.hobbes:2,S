You've identified the problem yourself.
When I wrote the new ps, I made a rule for myself: the default
output would not require sorting of any kind. Output would be
produced as soon as possible. This is for performance, and to
help tolerate kernel bugs that cause a hang.
So far I've resisted using threads myself to work around the
hang problem.
It won't be "ps --threads 231". It will be one of the following
options if you do want to see individual threads: m -m -T -L
(the options are in use on Tru64, AIX, IRIX, Solaris, UnixWare...)
So think of a way to wrap tasks together, preferably in a
way that is impossible for a non-POSIX thread to escape from.
Taking a guess at it:
Have an inherited task-group-ID that gets set equal to the task ID
whenever a task breaks away from other tasks. This includes fork(),
execve(), and any unshare() call that might be implemented. Note that
this does not, and indeed _must_ not, enforce POSIX signal behavior.
(the leader of a new and empty group might be able to request the
POSIX behavior for his group, but it can not be the default)
