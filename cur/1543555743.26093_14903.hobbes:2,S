Ok. I won't use that card anymore, and wont compile this part of code
neither. But I still doesn't know why does my 2.4.0-test11 crash to black:
no console, not keyboard, no logs, nothing... like a cut on the
electricity. 
Just some mins ago I got another interesting thing: (with the eepro100
driver)
I've been logged in trough ssh. Like 5-10 mins before the crash the packet
loss jumped up to around 30% (the network was ok, the other hosts on the
same network came with 0% loss) Then after a while no answare to the ping,
but my ssh worked still, and even I could log in. So it seems so, that
something in the network driver died, and it didn't answare anymore to the
ICMP requests. 
On the console was nothing again. When the guy pressed the ctrl-alt-del,
the normal reboot message came to the ssh terminals, but nothing happened
on the console, or on the computer (no hard drive activity, no leds on the
keyboard)
For the confusion of the services maybe the libc6 could be blamed. But I
yet doesn't understan why the packet loss rise, and why wasn't the console
working.
And a note for Alan: it isn't so simple to hack the Mylex driver from the
2.2.17 into the 2.2.14... I'm currently trying it...
