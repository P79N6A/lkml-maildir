Despite your markup language, I thought keeping the 'sync' sounded like
a good idea, since that's the function it's replacing.
Here's a patch. I've done a small amount of testing with a 4p machine.
I've at least seen that the average call to singleshot is down around 90
cycles, pretty similar/expected. We'll test on the original platform and
post results.
