i'm not particularly interested in improving the quality of such 
drivers. I'm interested in improving the quality of _open_ code. And not 
making too many promises in advance about how our kernel internals will 
look like in the future is a fundamental aspect of that.
So i have no problems with export trivial or cast-into-stone aspects of 
the kernel - doing that simply has no negative effects on open code. But 
the details of markers are far from settled and far from trivial.
