right, we do have string versions in arch/blackfin/lib/ and we do want
the "classical" gcc behavior here with "extern static".  an
extern_inline macro in compiler.h sounds good since
__attribute__((__gnu_inline__)) doesnt exist in gcc-3.4.x (the other
version that works for Blackfin other than gcc-4.1.x).
so i guess NACK this patch since we dont want "static inline" and we
dont yet support gcc-4.3 on Blackfin.
