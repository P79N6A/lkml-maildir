Would not it be nicer to add a /dev/pcimem that implements the given 
restrictive semantics?
Maybe it's just wishful thinking, but I am dreaming of an unprivileged 
X, and /dev/pcimem (owned by an 'x11' user or so) would be a step in 
that direction.

And so I could even get rid of /dev/mem.

With a pcimem, kernel people would not need to reconfig the kernel, just 
create/delete the node as they wish.
