Should I contact some guy at Promise regarding that issue?

This only affects onboard IDE usage?
Argh, I start to hate this AMD-MP stuff.
Btw., I get these messages from time to time (not often):
--8<--
APIC error on CPU1: 00(02)
APIC error on CPU0: 00(02)
--8<--
Should I boot with "noapic" or "disableapic"? But I guess this is
another issue...
