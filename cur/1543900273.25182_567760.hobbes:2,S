No one will want to use PPS API to keep accurate time past 2030?  Why
not?  Or should we be forced to invent a new PPS API before then to fix
this one?
Actually, come to think of it, is this passing a current time, or it it
passing an interval since last PPS?  If it is an interval, then yes
never mind, we don't need that many seconds (usually 1 or 2 at most).
For some reason I thought this was for passing the current time of a
stamp.
