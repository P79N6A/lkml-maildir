In my experience with embedded systems, usually the OS is residing in
flash with all of the apps. The hard disks are used a storage. Example
remote off grid high resolution time laps photography. the device
itself is simple OS, web server, and image grabber all reside in flash
32MB or so. Then HDs are used to store the images and turn off
completely at night and when disk is full.
