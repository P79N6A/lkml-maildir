I've killed currcon completely in the cyber2000fb driver in favour of
tracking which struct display is current.  Tracking 'currcon', doing
a whole pile of special cases, and copying 'var' stuff to/from fb.var
didn't make sense anymore.  I'm expecting the same thing will happen
with the other stuff in the struct fb_info.
(Think about the current cyber2000fb code, and what happens to other
consoles when you fbset 800x600-60 -a and then switch to them to
discover you only have a 640x480 window where the characters appear).
