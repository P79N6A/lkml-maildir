Greg, please note that while there are people planning to change the
kernel to require an initramfs to boot on any machine, there are a number
of people who disagree with this approach, since the initramfs changes to
make it possible to be mandatory are not in the kernel yet (let alone the
flame war^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hdiscussion that will take place before
initramfs is made mandatory) you can't tell Kevin to build his code in
such a way that it only works if you have it.
once initramfs is to the point where it can be made mandatory, then if
Linus states that he wants to mandate drivers as modules useing initramfs,
then you can tell new drivers they can't be compiled in and can depend on
userspace tools like /sbin/hotplug.
given that we had a patch a week or so ago to change how modules get
loaded into memory to avoid a 'several percentage point' speed difference
between modules and built-in and that the people pushing 'do everything in
initramfs' have been saying for years that there is no performance
difference I for one am not convinced that mandating initramfs is a good
thing.
