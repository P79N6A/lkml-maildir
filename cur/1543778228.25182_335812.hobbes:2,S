Because -mm is the development tree. The things in -mm are what's
eventually going to end up in mainline, so that's what you want to be
testing and fixing, and it's also further ahead than 2.6.12.3 (which
is esentially a dead branch except for critical fixes) so stuff may
already have been fixed there that was broken in 2.6.12.3

Right you are, and I for one am glad you do it. I build randconfig
kernels myself to look for trouble spots, but I can't get anywhere
near building 200+ configs. On a good day I may build 5 or 6
randconfigs of the latest kernel inbetween doing other things, so
getting hold of the results of several hundred randconfig builds gives
me a lot of material to work on that I would never have the time to
gather myself. Thanks.
