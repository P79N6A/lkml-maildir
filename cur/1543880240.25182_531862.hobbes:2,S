Hmm. User's expectation is failover of clustering ASAP by panic.
Even if free memory remain due to cpuset/mempolicy setting,
some people may want failover soon.
Of course some other people don't want panic if free memory remain.
I think it depends on user.
If panic_on_oom is 1, only panic if mempolicy/cpuset is not used.
And if panic_on_oom is 2, panic on all case.
This might be desirable.
Bye.
