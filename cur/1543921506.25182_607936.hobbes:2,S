No - it is a kernel module.
But what a messy codebase to look at...

From the file "the-linux-kernel.h":
/*
 * Include iprt/types.h to install the bool wrappers.
 * Then use the linux bool type for all the stuff include here.
 */
#include <iprt/types.h>
#define bool linux_bool
And that file named "types.h" is not a kernel types.h - so we miss that
file. I guess it was pulled in by some other headerfile in the past.
But I also notice that it latest source from VirtualBox the
line number for include of spinlock-h does not match.
This is most likely a combination of VirtualBox doing strange strange things
and some deep dependency missing in one of the headerfiles.
Add a #include <linux/types.h> to the-linux-kernel.h and let us know if it helps.
