	As a thought, one thing I was thinking of is, if you have a list of
what devices are in a system by major,minor, if there was then a way to
query information about that device you could then have a user-space proggy
create the location-based device names for you...
	Of course, this does cause some issue when you wonder about the
problems of a major,minor pairs being reused...  Hadn't thought about that
one much yet. ;)
