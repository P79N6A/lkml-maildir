Hi Johannes,
I don't think that this is quite right, or at least it isn't quite the
same as before. I think that was is below will toggle
SYS_SUPPORTS_APM_EMULATION when PMAC_APM_EMU is selected,
which I think is what you want. Is it also neccessary to
add a dependancy on PPC_PMAC to PMAC_APM_EMU ?
config PMAC_APM_EMU
	tristate "APM emulation"
	select APM_EMULATION
	depends on ADB_PMU && PM
config SYS_SUPPORTS_APM_EMULATION
	bool
	default y if PMAC_APM_EMU
