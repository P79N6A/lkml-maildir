On my HP dc7600U having patch around the MCG problem
I now get a bit further. Previous working kernel was 2.6.16
from Fedora Code 4.
I see:
Uncompressing Linux... Ok, botinh the kernel.
Red Hat nash version 4.2.15 starting
  Reading all physical volumes.  This may take a while...
  No volume groups found
  Unable to find volume group "VolGroup00"
ERROR: /bin/lvm exited abnormally with value 5 ! (pid 351)
Then a few more errors and Kernel panic
Where would the problem be?
