Subject: [PATCH] Make SCSI-system aware of type 12-devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/7/15/120

This small patch doesn't display "Unkown" when a type 12 device is found,
when scanning for scsi-devices on a scsi-chain. I also included the 
declaration of TYPE_PRINTER which wasn't there. All theese types are
described in 
ftp://ftp.t10.org/t10/drafts/spc/spc-r11a.pdf
 page 51, 
table 21.
