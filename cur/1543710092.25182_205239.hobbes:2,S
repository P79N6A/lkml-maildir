    It was my first thought actually - when I have started typeing in 
e-mail.
    When I have reached half e-mail - I have understood that this is 
simple performance consideration - stack space is allocated once.
    I have tryed to convert my e-mail to another issue - but seems I did 
it not good enough :-)
    But then I realized that my thinking was wrong - I'm using variables 
in different never overlapping contextes. But space allocated for 
everyone. "if (..) { int i; }; if (...) { int i; }" will result not in 
sizeof(int) stack space allocated - but in sizeof(int)*2.
    It seems that gcc check size required by all top level contextes in 
function - it checks for "if { int a[16] } else { int a[16] }" - space 
allocated correctly.
    But 'if () { int a[16]; }; if () { int a[16] };' seems to break 
something, and sum of the sizes for both if()'s spaces finishes 
allocated on stack. And this was the case with macro in my module.
    I doubt I can write competent report/query to gcc mail list - 
probably it is worth to ask there.
