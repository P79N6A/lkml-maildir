I apologize, I'm just not reading, am I?  Thanks for re-explaining.
You're right, the condition on clearing is fine.  It's the (lack of
condition on) setting that's over-enthusiastic, should be saying:
	if (start - vma->vm_start != (pgoff - vma->vm_pgoff) << PAGE_SHIFT)
		vma->vm_flags |= VM_NONLINEAR;
(Unless I'm making a fool of myself again.)
