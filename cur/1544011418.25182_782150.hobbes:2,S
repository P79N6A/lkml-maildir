Its wrong on various counts
- ata_id_major_version can't tell early ATA versions apart
- on anything later than the early ISA IDE paddles (the ones that
basically were just bus decoders) its invisible to the drive
Except for legacy ISA bus controllers (and even there it is questionable)
I would favour simply ignoring it.
The reverse half of the problem (the fact the ATA8 drafts reuse it and
can cause confusion if your device is treacherous computing crippled) is
IMHO just amusing 8)
