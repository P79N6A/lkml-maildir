Subject: Failure building 2.4 while running 2.4.  Success in building 2.4 while running 2.2.

I have RedHat7, glibc-2.2-9, gcc-2.96-69.
I can build 2.4.0 while running kernel 2.2.16.
If I try to rebuild 2.4.0 while running the new kernel, I get random
compiler errors.
It happens on two machines.  One of them runs 2.4.0-test12, the other
2.4.0.  Both of them with the updates above mentioned.
I know this is a RedHat issue, but it may be useful to know for some.
