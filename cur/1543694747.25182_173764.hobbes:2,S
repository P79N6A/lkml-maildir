I'm not suggesting the drive off-load it.  I'm only
suggesting that there be a mechanism for the host to be more
involved if the host is capable.
The problem that began this thread is a perfect example.  A
bad block that the drive firmware apparently will not remap
calls for the ability to explicitly instruct the drive to
remap it.  In some cases it might be good to be able to let
the host countermand a remap if the disk reports overtemp.

No disagreement here.
