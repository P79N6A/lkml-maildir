The patch named there has been integrated, verifyable at 
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset@4129735fMSVl0_RA4uNcNBWHFjT-zw
However this time the bug is probably due to something entirely different, the 
message is not very specific.
Tried 2.6.12? SKAS has been already updated (plus there's an important update 
for SKAS, from -V8 to -V8.2).
