Well, this pretty much depends on the "sound card" you are accessing.
You mentioned about AD1980 but the question is rather what
controller is used.  The codec chip is basically independent from the
DMA transfer parameter.

Also depends on the hardware.  If the audio chip requires the DMA
transfer, you'd need anyway a buffer.
