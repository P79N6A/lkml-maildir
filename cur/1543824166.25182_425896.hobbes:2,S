With the patch I sent earlier, this may not be required: Since
__get_vm_area_node calls kmalloc, it should be taken care of in
kmalloc and friends. Currently cache_alloc_debugcheck_before doesn't
check for in_interrupt(); perhaps that is the right place to add
if (flags & GFP_WAIT)
	BUG_ON(in_interrupt());
Thanks,
