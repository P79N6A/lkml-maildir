Hi!
Someone has code to dump kernel crashes to floppy. Sorry, I wforgot
where to download that code.
I want to use it: my ax59pro mainboard will oops on APM poweroff, and
ACPI poweroff is NOP. In dos, apm does poweroff. So I tried to hook
poweroff code into process just before jmp ffff:0000 but it did not
work: seems we do not create sane-enough environment for APM to work.
