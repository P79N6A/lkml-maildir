Btw, I've tried in the past to express why I think the BK model is so
good, and why CVS ans Subversion totally suck, and I think the previous
email perhaps explains it best.
It really is a very important conceptual thing, that "network" vs 
"hierarchy" difference.  And I know we all love bashing Larry, but give 
the guy a pat on the back for really making that difference visible.
