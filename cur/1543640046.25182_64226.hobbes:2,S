Non argument.  What about old motherboards?  What about modern motherboards that
don't have sound, and yes, they do exist.

Non argument.  What about if you have cycles to burn, but no sound hardware?

So what?  If it works on *your* hardware then you want the option.

You simply argued that because it might not work well for everybody, then
nobody should have it.  I hope you see the fallacy.
I have two machines here that want it, and on which it works fine.  One of
them is a modern server.
It's a small patch and decently coded.  Sure, it could use a little more work,
but that is exactly what it will get if it's in mainline.  I'm in favor of
seeing this in mainline.
