I also use gcc 2.95 and have no intention to change compilers
for 2.4 at all as this compiler is most dependable and never
screwed up unlike 3.1.x and 3.2.2.
Documentation/Codingstyle also refers to K&R who historically
declare variables at the top of a function.
Excerpt:
	"all right-thinking people know that
	(a) K&R are _right_ and (b) K&R are right"
