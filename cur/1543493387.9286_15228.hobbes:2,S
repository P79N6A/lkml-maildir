Yes it is possible.
But the current kernels have a driver limit of 6.
It is easy to increase this limit,I by adding more major
numbers (each IDE interface (drive pair) requires a major number).
Create the new majors:  IDE6_MAJOR, IDE7_MAJOR, .. as many as needed.
Then just grep for all occurances of the existing IDE5_MAJOR
in linux/drivers/block/*.[ch], and add equivalent code/entries
for the new MAJORs.
Recompile and reboot.  Presto.
