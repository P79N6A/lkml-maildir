I've seen similar behavior. It was caused by a mistake when setting
the clock on a freshly installed system. Somehow my error
propagated into /etc/adjtime, causing an enormous clock adjust at boot
time. Look at the first number in /etc/adjtime on the first line: it
should be in the range -10.0...10.0 to be reasonable (I have 1.3).
It is safe to throw this file away (see man hwclock, man adjtimex).
