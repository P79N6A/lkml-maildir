Just to see how it worked, I installed
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hedrick/ide.2.2.16.all.20000805.patch.gz
the other day, on my Abit KA7 (Via KX133, Via 82C586 IDE controller)
with RY beta BIOS.  The problem I was curious to see if it solved
was that my devices on the secondary cable were not getting detected
as UDMA capable (at least not automatically), using stock 2.2.16.
It did in fact appear to solve that problem, but it created another. 
It doesn't appear to pull the correct geometry from hdc, which is an
IBM Deskstar 75GXP 30G drive.  I've thought about just overriding
with the right geometry, but this sort of issue probably ought to be
done automagically for joe user's benefit.  Here's the relevant kernel
messages in the stock 2.2.16 case:

In fact I've always been a little surprised that the initial CHS
sizes on hdc/hdd have been incorrect, but I've become used to it and
to seeing the correct CHS values ascertained from the partition
table checks later on in the boot process.  What does worry me is
that the patched via driver seems to result in incorrect CHS
information for the partition table check.  
Is this an actual bug, or am I missing something?  It appeared to
mount my dos partitions that extended beyond the supposed 1027
cylinder end of hdc, but I was reluctant to push my luck at attempt
to actually write to the disk in that setup.  fdisk also had a fit
about the partition table referring to "invalid" cylinders beyond
the end of the disk.
Can I just override with the correct geometry (3737/255/63, LBA)?
Thanks!  Let me know if I should be directing this question
elsewhere.
