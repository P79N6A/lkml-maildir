why not?  the two namespaces should not clash... and i really hope that
there aren't any tools out there referencing proc via inode num.  what

it doesn't exactly discourage transition either, and i don't see how
changing proc to hide/not hide stuff encourages it.  at some point it
has to be a distribution issue, regardless of the transitioning scheme.
if a union could be made to work (and as above i'd like to know why it
couldn't, if only for my own education :-) it means you don't have to go
removing stuff later on.

imho this violates the principle of least-surprise, although i suppose
if you're mounting the fs you're probably expecting it so its probably
ok.
curious,
