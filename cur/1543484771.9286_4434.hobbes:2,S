Will this "efficient low level device driver" work over a network as
well as X does?  Given that gigabit ethernet is just around the corner,
bandwidth is _not_ a problem.  I wouldn't like to see a situation
develop where game writers choose a limiting, non-standard interface
to get short-term performance increase.  There already is a complete
solution.  It's called X.
X or text.  If you think X is too slow, fix it.
