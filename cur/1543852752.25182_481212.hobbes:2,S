It's E1 interface card, I use them for telephony.
I am pretty sure that Tau32 isn't guilty (I did tests with and without
it installed), see interrupts

Didn't acpi=off meant to hose interrupt routing, SMP, and poweroff?
I'll try it right now.
And thanks, I didn't know about firmware test kit either ... will
download it right now and test in a few hours.
