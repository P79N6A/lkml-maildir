Well, "AMD64 Architecture Programmer’s Manual" says the following:
The choice of 2 Mbyte or 4 Mbyte as the large physical-page size
depends on the value of CR4.PSE and CR4.PAE, as follows:
- If physical-address extensions are enabled (CR4.PAE=1), the
   large physical-page size is 2 Mbytes, regardless of the value
   of CR4.PSE.
- If physical-address extensions are disabled (CR4.PAE=0)
   and CR4.PSE=1, the large physical-page size is 4 Mbytes.
- If both CR4.PAE=0 and CR4.PSE=0, the only available page
   size is 4 Kbytes.
Greetings,
Rafael
