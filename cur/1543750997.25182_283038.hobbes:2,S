Ingo has described it thus:
before:
  0x08000000 ... binary code
  0x08xxxxxx ... brk area
  0x40000000 ... start of mmap, new mmaps go after old ones
  0xbfxxxxxx ... stack
after:
  0x08000000 ... binary code
  0x08xxxxxx ... brk area
  0xbfxxxxxx ... _end_ of all mmaps, new mmaps go below old ones
  0xbfyyyyyy ... stack
the 'after' layout guarantees that brk area (malloc()) can grow
unlimited and mmap() can grow unlimited - they will meet somewhere
inbetween when almost all of the VM is used up. [the 'top' of the mmaps
in the 'after' layout is constrained by the stack ulimit - the stack
must still fit and we never allocate into the stack's yet unallocated
and growable hole.]
with the 'before' layout we've got 900 MB for brk() and 1.9GB for
mmaps() - a rigid limit.
