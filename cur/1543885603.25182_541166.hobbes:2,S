No!  Reservations code is *critical* here.  Without reservations, we get
disastrously-bad layout if two processes were running a large fallocate()
at the same time.  (This is an SMP-only problem, btw: on UP the timeslice
lengths save us).
My point is that even though reservations save us, we could do even-better
in-kernel.
But then, a smart application would bypass the glibc() fallocate()
implementation and would tune the reservation window size and would use
direct-IO or sync_file_range()+fadvise(FADV_DONTNEED).

A PVR implementor would take all this over and would do it themselves, for
sure.

An application could do sys_fallocate(one-byte) to work out whether it's
supported in-kernel, I guess.
