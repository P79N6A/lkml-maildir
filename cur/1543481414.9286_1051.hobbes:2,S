		They could `jns` for numbers less than MAX_INT.

Well `cleanly` doesn't necessarily mean using {{{{{...}}}}} nesting when
none is required. It also doesn't mean that `goto` can't be used. After
all, the actual op-codes do `gotos` all the while (jumps/jumps on
condition).

Good machine-code was most always faster on a slow machine than poor
machine-code on a fast machine. However, with the advent on the 400+
MHz processors, where everything is now I/O bound with main memory,
it seems to become less important to minimize instructions. The way
memory access is done becomes a controlling factor now (read/write
whole aligned longwords when you only want to access a byte). This
RISC-ness will go away when we get main memory that can keep up with
the CPU clocks.
It won't be too long now. The 100MHz memory will be running at 330MHz
in a year or two. Unfortunately it's another motherboard change. So,
the fact that good code may not run any faster than bad code presently, 
should not be an end unto itself. In a few years, the good code
will outperform the bad code again.
Cheers,
