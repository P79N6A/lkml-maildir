Right, I agree HZ is inconsistent. That is why I am trying to get users
to use human-time interfaces, that way when HZ becomes dynamic (think
tickless!) or variable at compile-time (already in -mm with efforts to
get it merged to mainline via CONFIG_HZ). I know code authors have
failed to observe the brokenness of ticks as time and am trying my
hardest to fix up as many callers as possible. If nothing else, use
schedule_timeout({msecs,usecs,nsecs}_to_jiffies(some_time_value));
I'm not saying your code is incorrect, by the way, I am just trying to
make it maintainable and work on a kerneljanitor TODO.

Ok, there isn't much point in arguing this further then. My point was
simply this: there is *a lot* of code that has not been updated since
2.4 wrt. to sleep times. Thus, I cannot tell by reading the code,
necessarily, whether a schedule_timeout(1) is referring to 1 millisecond
or 1 tick. But that just may be me being confused.
I appreciate all your feedback, Maciej.
Thanks,
Nish
