Forgive me if I mis-understand the fastcall method, but this is the
concept. Instead of having a fastcall function that implmements the
gettimofday/clock_gettime + ntp scaling + etc all in asm we do the
following:
When creating a ia64 timesource (say the cyclone just for a specific
example) we do something like the following.
/* trivial delta (nothing new here) */
static cycle_t cyclone_fastcall_delta(cycle_t now, cycle_t then)
{
	return (now - then);
}
/* trivial cyc2ns (nothing new here) */
static nsec_t cyclone_fastcall_cyc2ns(cycle_t cyc, cycle_t* remainder)
{
	u64 rem;
	cyc *= freq_multiplier;
	if (remainder)
		*remainder = 0;
	return (nsec_t)cyc;
}
/* fastcall read, this is where it gets interesting */
static cycle_t cyclone_fasatcall_read(void)
{
	u64 ret;
	ret = fastcall_readcyclonecounter();
	return (cycle_t)ret;
}
struct timesource_t timesource_cyclone_fastcall = {
	.name = "cyclone_fastcall",
	.priority = 100,
	.read = cyclone_fastcall_read,
	.delta = cyclone_fastcall_delta,
	.cyc2ns = cyclone_fastcall_cyc2ns,
};
Then you implement a fastcall for fastcall_readcyclonecounter(), which
in crazy ia64 asm would do something like:
ENTRY(fastcall_readcyclonecounter)
blip	// magic privledge escalation
blop	// load cyclone counter into memory
bloop	// copy cyclone counter back into return register
;;
END(fastcall_readcyclonecounter)
This avoids 150+ lines of asm needed to re-implement the gettimeofday
math.
However, I could be mistaken. Is something like this possible?
thanks
