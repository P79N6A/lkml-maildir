Does a complete lockup while running md5sum count as bad things? :)
Completely locked up, sysrq did nothing, nothing logged in syslog.
As to running a copy working, I was unable to find out due to the
PAGE_BUG(page) call causing an oops and a segfault.  The oops was preceded
by many "attempt to access beyond end of device" messages.
