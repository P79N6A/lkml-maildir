And that is bad in what way?  If you try to apply that patch from
'somedir' you expect patch/BK to have ESP to know it should apply
under 'linux'.  If 'patch' will apply such a diff, then it is just
a sign of the problems you were complaining about - that it uses
heuristics to guess which file to modify, and they are not 100% right.
Of course, if you are really talking about a patch, and not a BK
changeset, then the problem lies solely with 'patch' and 'diff'
and has nothing to do with BK at all.
Cheers, Andreas
