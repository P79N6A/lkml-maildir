So you are saying that setup_frame() should reserve enough signal
stack-space to use the default handler if the signal stack grows
beyond limits? Let's look at the case of root where there is no
getrlimit set.
Perhaps, generically, there should be enough stack-space reserved to
handle the default signal. This would allow an overflow to be caught in
all cases.
I think it could be done easier than that. If you are going to SIGSEGV,
and you are running out of stack, you could use any place on the signal
stack because the existing return addresses are never going to be used.
In other words, reset the signal stack-pointer, change the vector to
SIG_DFL, and let it happen. This may screw up observations of the
core-dump if it is turned on, but do we have any tools that actually
look at the signal stack on a core-dump?
