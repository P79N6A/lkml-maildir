Hi all,
It seems widely reported that recent versions of Linux do not work 
properly with non-USB keyboards and mice when built for SMP. I just 
tried 2.6.8rc2, and the problem is still there. The workaround many 
people have is to turn off USB legacy support in their BIOS. On my Tyan 
2665 motherboard there is no BIOS option to do this. If I turn off USB 
support completely in the BIOS my machine runs OK, but then...... well, 
I want USB working :-) With a non-SMP kernel I do not have any problems.
Is this problem being actively addressed by anyone, or is the "turn off 
legacy support" workaround considered an adequate fix?
Regards,
Steve
