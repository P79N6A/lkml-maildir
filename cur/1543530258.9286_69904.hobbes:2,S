"very important stuff" is a very wide term... it will end up being "all
root processes", and that is (essentially) square one.

How do you know it is a root login, and not Jane Random Luser?

"certain important commands" is again a very wide term...

Those cron/at jobs might very well be much more important that the random
httpd which just exploded, or Joe Random's mp3 player.

Note the nice(1) man page, which traditionally says something like: "Bugs:
Nobody uses it"
In any case, your VM priorities _must_ be tied to niceness, it makes no
sense to have a high-level VM priority on a process that never gets to
run. And, AFAIU this is what Rik's patch does on itself...
And, yet again (it must be around a dozen times now): OOM is an extremely
exceptional condition, absolutely *NO* extra effort should be expended on
solving just this problem.
