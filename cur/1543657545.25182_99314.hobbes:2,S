Oh, I see what you mean.  This behavior is a "feature" of the old
xconfig (it's been so since the 2.0 times or thereabouts). menuconfig
will hide entirely what xconfig merely grays out.

Right.

That's just my word choice sucking noodles as usual.  I should
probably be referring to these changes with something like "make
the submenu dependent on its parent entry," which wouldn't take
for granted any of the pecularities a certain config frontend
might throw in.  You see, in 2.4, config, menuconfig and xconfig
all have their own mechanics for work with Config.in files.
(Ever noticed how menuconfig and xconfig produce different
.config's while the options chosen are identical?)

Hope this clarifies.

Yes, but no one is really fond of the thought of the options getting
rearranged too much.  There's the old "Yes, it's not ideal, but if
you woke me up totally wasted at 3 a.m., I'd know where to look for
CONFIG_HRM0PS54554."

Thanks.
