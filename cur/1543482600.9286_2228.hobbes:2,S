1. I disabled BIOS PnP
2. The card works under dos with the old settings
3. Mad16 works with the settings
   io=0x530 irq=11 dma=0
4. CS4232 still doesn't work
# modprobe cs4232 synthirq=9 synthio=0x290 io=0x530 irq=11 dma=0 dma2=1
/lib/modules/2.2.0/misc/cs4232.o: init_module: Device or resource busy
I'm sure it ISN'T a PnP card. The BIOS doesn't detect it and pnpdump
says '# No boards found'.
