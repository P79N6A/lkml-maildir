There is no notion of priority in the current timer system, although that idea 
has been tossed around a bit.  As far as an appropriate timer for events, as 
opposed to timeouts, consider using ktimers + hrtimers (both of which are 
included in the -rt patchset).  The are optimized for times that you expect 
to expire (as opposed to timeouts which usually don't) and can provide 
accuracy to the 10s of microseconds.
