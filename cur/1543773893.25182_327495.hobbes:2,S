FWIW Chuck, this is precisely how OS/2 Warp 3 got page tuned when I was with
IBM Boca many years ago.  The compilers got tweaked to be able to emit
function code to different text sections and a massive system wide code
triage was undertaken based on "common usage scenario" profiling run data
from the perf analysis group.  The results spoke for themselves compared to
the previous 2.X releases - this plan can work and pay off very well.  It
DID worked and paid off very well.
