Hmmm...
you don't really give enough information to make much of a guess.
I'd do the following:
Grab at least 2.2.18, or even better, get Alan's 2.2.19pre (which is almost
2.2.19 now, I believe), and build and install that kernel.
Now, if you run into the same problems, record the crash details, especially
if the kernels oopses, and then send the information (kernel version, output
of ksymoops if there is an oops, kernel .config used etc.) to the mailing list.
