Are you sure such a user visible semantic change is a good idea? 
I at least have written (not very important, but existing) user space
code in the past that assumed it can stop and single step without
SIGCONT. I wouldn't be surprised if other debuggers ran into 
the same issue.
And the Linux debugging world is not gdb only anymore, there are
a lot of other users of ptrace around these days ...
I don't think it is very good to change such behaviour in 2.6.
Please don't do it.
