    Oh, I thought that the only thing that affected speed was the
VariRec (is that one that makes writing at 4x), and that must be
enabled explicitly. Thanks a lot, I will try to see if POWEREC is
giving me hell ;)) How can I get rid of POWEREC with cdrecord,
without needing to install the recorder on a WinDOS?
    BTW, the POWEREC issue makes sense, since the writer will stop at
20x/16x (depending on what's being written, data/audio), but I'm
afraid that the only solution is using better quality media
(currently I'm using Traxdata, 40x capable, and a Plextor disk that
is supposed to be capable of 48x, maybe Plextor gives low quality
sample disks ;)))?) or disabling POWEREC (Windows only Plextools, I'm
afraid...) and take the risk...
    Thanks a lot for pointing this :))
