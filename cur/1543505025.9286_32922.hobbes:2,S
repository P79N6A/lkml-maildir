Many thanks Mike. I've just checked, and the DNS for my MemAlpha.CX
domain has crashed - and the SysAdmin is away on holiday for several
weeks as well !!!
Please use my backup address until such time as I can get this sorted
out, which is the address this email is sent from, namely...
	rhw@bigfoot.com
Alternatively, if you know where I could set up a DNS server in the
meantime, I can arrange for DNS requests to be routed there until this
is sorted out...
Best wishes from Riley.
