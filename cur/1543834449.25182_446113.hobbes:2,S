Hi all,
We would like to ask you a few questions about your use of the GIT
version control system. This survey is mainly to understand who is
using GIT, how and why.
The results will be published in the the git wiki and discussed on the git
mailing list.
We'll close the survey on the 6th of August.
Please devote a few minutes of your time to fill this simple
questionnaire, it will help a lot the git community to understand your
needs, what you like of git and of course what you don't like  of it.
The survey can be found here:
