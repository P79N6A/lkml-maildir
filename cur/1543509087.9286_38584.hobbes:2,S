I believe that this may be a kernel bug:
After starting pppd and logging out, I receive a message simillar to
this:
mgod:~# ppp-go
Local IP: 207.247.19.42
Remote IP: 207.217.141.14
mgod:~# exit
logout
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
00000004
current->tss.cr3 = 07F8B000, %cr3 = 07F8B000
*pde = 00000000
Oops: 0000
CPU:    0
EIP:  0010:[<C012CD76>]
EFLAGS: 00010007
eax: 00000000 ebx: C2064010 ecx: C7FBC808 edx: 00000000
esi: C206400C edi: C2064000 ebp: 00000287 esp: C7FFBEF0
ds:  0018     es:  0018     ss:  0018
Process init (pid: 1, process nr: 1, stackpage=C7FFB000)
...
(cut off due to space considerations)
Code: 8B 42 04 39 D8 75 F7 89 4A 04 55 9D 8B 06 50 E8 3A 7F FF FF
Then the system locks up to the point where I have to turn it off then
back on again.
I think ppp.c may be freeing some things prematurely, since everything
works fine if I don't use pppd.
Hmm...if I disabled the forced crash bit of code in mm/ I may be able to 
get it to run normally, at the expense of stability.
Thanks,
