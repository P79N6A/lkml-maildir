Slip of the mailer. It posted when I wanted to cancel the mail (I had to
step out for an errand)...
OK. I see what you mean now. Do you agree with the following analysis?
        1) We need 2 extra locks for the case where we
        upgrade/downgrade, a single existing lock and end up splitting
        it.
        2) We need to use 1 extra lock in the case where we unlock and
        split a single existing lock.
        3) We also need to use 1 extra lock in the case where there is
        no existing lock that is contiguous with the region to lock.
In all other cases, we resort to modifying existing locks instead of
using new_fl/new_fl2.
In cases (1) and (2) we do need to modify the existing lock. Since this
is only done after we've set up the extra locks, we're safe.
Could I still suggest a couple of modifications to your patch? Firstly,
we only need to test for 'added' once. Secondly, in cases (2) and (3),
we can still complete the lock despite one of new_fl/new_fl2 failing to
be allocated.
Cheers,
  Trond
