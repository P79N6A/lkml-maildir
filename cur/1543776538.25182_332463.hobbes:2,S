Yeah, sorry, I put them in my tree, in order for me to work on them.

Heh, it's no where ready for such review, it needs a lot of cleanup.  I
did a lot of it about 12 months ago, but lost it somehow, don't want to
do that again...
I would not recommend reading the code just yet, unless you want to feel
ill...

Yes, that's just the start of what needs to be done.  But I like it in
the -mm tree for now to at least give it wider testing to users who rely
on this hardware in order to have access to their machines.  I'll be
slowly working on it over the next month or so to fix these issues and
the placement of where it hooks into the main kernel.  Then I will
submit the driver for review by all of lkml.  I will not send it to
Linus until everyone agrees that it is acceptable.
thanks,
