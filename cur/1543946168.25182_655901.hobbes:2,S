I had troubles with the Silicon Motion SM501/SM502 endianess on PowerPC PCI vs. LocalBus.
The chip also has a register to swap endianess, but that seems to only affect some
LocalBus modes.
The current fb and X drivers are working, but when it comes to font
aliasing and hw-acceleration, the problems start to rise again...
