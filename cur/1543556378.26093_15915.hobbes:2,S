You saying that you were running test kernels on a production box and
seriously didn't expect something bad to happen?
Filesystem corruptions arent things you can recover files from. You're
confusing accidentally deleting files and undeleting them later.
What would be useful is if you noted where/why you ran 'fsck -y'. Did
you crash and fs check at boot failed? What?
