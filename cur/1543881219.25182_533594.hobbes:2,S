I haven't approached that yet, but I just noticed, having been booted to this 
for all of 5 minutes, that although I told it not to renice x when my script 
ran 'make oldconfig', and I answered n, but there it is, sitting at -19 
according to htop.
The .config says otherwise:
[root@coyote linux-2.6.21-rc7-CFS-v5]# grep RENICE .config
# CONFIG_RENICE_X is not set
So v5 reniced X in spite of the 'no' setting.
Although I hadn't noticed it, one way or the other, I just set it (X) back to 
the default -1 so that I'm comparing the same apples when I do compare.
