Hi all!

I had to throw away one faulty cd-disk, and now my 2.6-test11 works!!
I did two things while having troubles: Applied Linus's patch and
tried John Bradford's tip to turn off pre-emptive kernel (in processor 
options).
I am currently in a process to put pre-emptive back to enabled so soon I can 
tell if it was the patch or the option change.
I'll be back in one hour. Thanks already for Your help, this test11 kernel 
is fast and goog, I LIKE it!!!
Rgds,
    Tero
