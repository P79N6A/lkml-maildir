rm -rfi -- "????????????????????????????..."

I would redirect 'ls' to a file and edit it as a shell-script if the name
it too long or strange. You don't need to know inodes. You can easily
remove any named file or directory tree as long as the name in printable.
Unix-101 trick: put a file called * in some newbys home directory.
