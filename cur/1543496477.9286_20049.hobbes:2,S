Does linux-2.2.9 handle unreachables *not* sent in triplicate ok?  I
noticed when using:
http://www.research.digital.com/cgi-bin/trace
(check statistical reporting)
That traceroutes to any linux box report 10% packet loss.  Yet tracing to
any windows box is 0%.  I am talking about last hop packet loss here btw.
That particular traceroute utility uses 10 unreachables.  Using tcpdump, I
see only 9 of them reach my machine, which is why the packet loss.  But
then I started trying every linux box I knew on the net, and they all seem
to report 10% loss, even www.linux.org.  Any ideas?  The traceroute tools
that send 3 unreachables, like normal, linux does fine with.
