is there a common field in net_device{} for link state (not just up or
down, but media type too)?
all the various ethernet drivers seem to handle link changes rather
differently.  being able to notify userspace of media changes in a
not-driver-specific manner would be nice as links flapping from 10 to
100Mbps and back often means problems are afoot.
also i am undecided on _how_ to tell userspace about it...  the current
hotplug system only seems to handle plug/unplug, whereas this is a
device state change and as such doesn't really fit the mould...
