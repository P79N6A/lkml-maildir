The amount of data going over the wire is actually the same, only the
amount of data read from the i8042 increases, and that isn't a problem.
More on the translation: Switching it off also makes the Focus9000
keyboard behave reasonably, because keys with codes over 0x80 aren't
a problem anymore. The old driver has to have terrible kludges in it
to allow presing and releasing keys with codes over 0x80.

My current keyboard driver in the input patches doesn't attempt to
switch out of the default set2 unless a command option is passed to it,
telling it to attempt set3, because that one is better.
Many keyboards have problems with set3 implementation, because windows
doesn't use that and it is not tested by the manufacturers.
