hello.
one question, didn't find any other information souce.
in kernel 2.4 /proc/meminfo writes back exactly mem info values
in the first 2 lines like:
cat /proc/meminfo
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  244191232 238395392  5795840        0  2732032 138403840
Swap: 509923328 147443712 362479616
but with 2.6 it looks like they have been removed. where can i get the
exactly free memory (+ swap) from the kernel so i havn't to use the
kb-values which i get back from /proc/meminfo?
i try to check the source good from "free" (with the -b option it
returns the bytes-value) which seems to simple multiply *1024 to
the kb values.
thanks for any info!
greetings, andi
