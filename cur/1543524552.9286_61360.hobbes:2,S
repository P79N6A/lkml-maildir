Yes, it's possible, I've done some simmlar things. 
I wouldn't suggest you get into it unless you want a weekend computer
science project. :) 
You'll need:
* Some understanding of IP networking
* iproute (the ip command)

For outbound direction it's easy.
Compile your kernel with equal cost multipath, and create two default
routes. This should be fine unless your provider uses some sort of
braindead filtering (i.e. no traffic from the wrong IP)
(This might do connection outbound balencing with regular masq, as I seem
to recall it gets the masq address from the route function. I'd have to
read the code to be sure).
For inbound direction, it's A LOT harder.
Many methods:
Type A) Multibox-two-faced-nat
If there will be multiple inside computers, you could use the generic nat
in 2.2 to translate inside boxes A, B, C to address1 and inside boxes
D,E,F to address2.
Pros: Easy to setup.
Cons: Won't do much good in a lot of enviroments.
Type B) Nat to one address, squid to both addresses.
You configure your masq to direct the inside clients to one address.
You configure squid on the box. With multiple default routes, it should
randomly bind to one per each web object. (Again, would have to check
source) If not, you would need to hack squid, or run 3 copies of squid
(one child; two parents one to each address).
There are of course other ways. :)
