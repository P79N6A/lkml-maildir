Hi there.
I am in the unfortunate position, that I need a kernel to run on a embedded
system without keyboard support (no kbd HW). My only interface is a serial
line and a EGA screen on the board.
My question is: How can you compile a kernel that dos'nt check for keyboard
or try to use one.
Make config does not give me that opportunity.
Regards.
