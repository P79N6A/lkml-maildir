Sure, when you are pushing your hardware to the maximum, you should
expect issues like this.  I agree we should do as best as we can for
things like this, but when you over-subscribe your PCI bus by doing
something like this, I really recommend just buying some hardware that
will work better for you (separate PCI busses, etc.  The hardware is out
there to do this properly.)

As is to be expected.

Sure, that's understandable.

Trying to do things the hardware is not ment to do, should not result in
cries from users :)
