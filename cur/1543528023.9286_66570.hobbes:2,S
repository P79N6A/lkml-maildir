I was able to capture a tcpdump during the NFS hang today.  Rather then
email ~6000 lines of logfiles to the list, you can grab it at
http://www.speculation.org/tcpdump_during_nfs_hang.
  The hang started at
14:00:21 and ended at 14:08:23 when I fixed it with the magical
incantation of umount -f.  There is several minutes of logs before and
after the offending time.
When looking at the log, bear in mind that there are 4 other NFS mounts
from the same NetApp that don't lock up.  During the hang I pinged the
NetApp and read and wrote files on the other mounts.  The hanging mount
is mounted with "nolock", but the other 4 have just "defaults".  tcpdump
command was ``tcpdump -vv -i eth2 -T rpc host 192.168.0.253''
/var/log/messages shows the same stuff I mentioned earlier:

Again, kernel is 2.2.12-32smp #1 SMP, stock RedHat 6.1 as oemed by Dell.
