I've exactly the the same Problem here, Kernel 2.5.66, no modules, no raid,
no lvm, tried with devfs and without it
	VFS:  Cannot open root device "301" or ide(3,1) <-- this IS my /dev/hda1
	kernel panic
- sys_mknod in mount_root for device 301 succeeds, but
- sys_mount in do_mount_root returns ENOENT for "/dev/root"
Kernel 2.5.65 compiled with the same Config-Options and the same compiler boots
correctly.
Any Suggestions ?
	Norbert
