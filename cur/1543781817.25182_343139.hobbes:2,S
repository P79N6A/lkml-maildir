Paul, I am not an expert at all, but honestly I don't see how
this could be achieved. This lock is heavily overloaded for
quite different purposes. I think that may be it makes sense
to try other steps, for example (random order):
  1. Tasklist protects ->sighand changing (de_thread) - rework
     sighand access/locking.
  2. Tasklist protects reparenting - fix this.
  .......
  N. PTRACE!!! Well, I close my eyes immediately when I see this
     word in the sources.
Only then we can eliminate tasklist locking from signal sending
path. But I don't see the easy way to solve any of these 1 - N
problems.
Currently I don't see how your patch could be "fixed" for SIGCONT
case, except very ugly:
	kill_proc_info(sig)
	{
		p = find_task_by_pid(pid);
		if (sig == SIGCONT)
			read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
		error = group_send_sig_info(...);
		...
	}
But there are other problems too.
Look at __group_complete_signal(), it scans p->pids[PIDTYPE_TGID].pid_list
list to find a a suitable thread. What if 'p' does clone(CLONE_THREAD) now?
Let's look at copy_process(), it does attach_pid(p, PIDTYPE_TGID, p->tgid)
under the lovely tasklist_lock again.
So, I don't beleive we can solve even the simplest case (single-recipient,
non fatal, non stop/cont) without significant locking rework.
I hope that your patch will stimulate this work.
Oleg.
