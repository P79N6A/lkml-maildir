I also have the same problem on an Abit NF7-S V2.0: I think I tested 
(non-SMP always) with kernel 2.6-test8 last: With Apic (and/or local 
apic) system locks up. Without it is now rock-solid with ACPI. But it 
seems to be a BIOS issue, as Windows locks up with APIC use, as well. 
Well I am using latest BIOS and hope that Abit gets this fixed...
BTW, why would someone want an SMP kernel for a 1-CPU system?
