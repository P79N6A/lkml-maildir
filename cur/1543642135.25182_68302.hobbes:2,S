You are not too specific, which makes it hard to understand what may
be going wrong so I'll assume that you probably did a bad thing.
(1)  You cannot sleep in an interrupt, which means you can't use
down_*() and friends inside an ISR.
(2)  Wait queues should work fine from the 'user-side' of a driver,
but again, you cannot ever sleep in an interrupt service routine.
Look in ../linux/drivers/* for examples of code that works.
(3)  You can't use any wait-queue or sleep on a semaphore while
holding a spin-lock or while the interrupts are disabled. You can
manage your own lock against re-entry in your procedure, but you
can't allow two tasks to try the same semaphore at (nearly) the
same time or you can dead-lock.
(4)	The fact that 'down' hangs means that there is nothing
that the CPU can do. This is direct evidence that you have the
interrupts disabled when down executes.
