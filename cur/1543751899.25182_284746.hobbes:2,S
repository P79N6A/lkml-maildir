Yes, TARGET_MEM_FUNCTIONS.  It's never not set for Linux targets.
Or for OSF/1 for that matter...  Indeed, it would take me some time
to figure out which targets it's *not* set for.
(Yet another thing that ought to get cleaned up -- either invert the
default value or simply require the target to either provide the libc
entry point or add a version to libgcc.)
I'm not sure how far back you'd have to go to find an Alpha compiler
that needs this.  Prolly back to at least gcc 2.6, but I don't have
sources that old handy to check.
