Subject: 2.2.[6,7] bug? vesafb no longer sets mtrr?

Hi,
When I boot 2.2.5 I get an entry in /proc/mtrr
reg01: base=0xfd000000 (4048MB), size=   4MB: write-combining, count=1
but with 2.2.6 and 2.2.7 I have to do it manually by:
echo "base=0xfd000000 size=0x400000 type=write-combining" > /proc/mtrr
I have "ATI Technologies Inc 215GP [Mach64 GP] (rev 5c)" card (according
to lspci).
I do not use atyfb but use vesafb because one can't select it on make
xconfig so I assumed it is for a good reason = "don't use it just yet -
experimental" ;)
Regards,
