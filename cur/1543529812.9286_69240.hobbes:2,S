I have to say that I don't consider it anything like a fair
comparison. Sorry.

That's what the comment at the top of the original version
indicates as being the reason for the path specified therein, and
notes that if a different path is used on that systemn, then the
path in question should be echoed there.

I've just checked, and it doesn't work for me either now, yet
it's the one I developed when RedHat 5.2 was current, and it
clearly worked then. Yours truly is clearly puzzled as to what
is going on there !!!
I have now developed one that actually works, but it does so by
changing the mode of the ver_linux script to 755 rather than the
644 that it comes with, then just running it. I know my original
version avoided that and worked, but I've no idea why the one I
have stored as being the version in question doesn't...

In my case, the existing script gives "1.2.so*" whereas the
revised script gives "2.1.2", both with the alias present.

At least, that's part of the key, but clealry there's something
else as well, and I'm not sure what...

I must have been asleep when I made that comment, sorry...
Please ignore it.

It COULD - not WOULD - although in that case, I wouldn't expect
it to. That's the direct implication of the comment at the start
of the current version.
However, doing that only fixes the problem with an alias for ls
whereas the version I was suggesting [used to] fix the problem
with aliases to ANY command.
I've never used an alias for any other command in that script,
but then, the developers have obviously never used an environment
where an alias for the ls command existed that included -F was
present, and that didn't stop the script getting hurt...

I can't think of an example that definately would, other than
what you suggest.
Anyway, here's a patch that works on a generic basis, and
includes your patch to use /proc/version if available. Whether
this will be acceptable is another question...

Ideally, there would be some means for the `patch` command to
specify that a particular file had changed mode and was now
executable (or wasn't, as the case may be), but I can't see that
coming any time soon...
