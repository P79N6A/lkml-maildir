How about just fixing the debug code to align things? Sure it wastes
a bit of memory, but debug code is like that.
Sane alignment might be: largest power-of-two factor of the size,
or 4 bytes, which ever is larger. (adjust "4" per-arch as needed)
For an SMP config, set a minimum alignment equal to the cache line size.
