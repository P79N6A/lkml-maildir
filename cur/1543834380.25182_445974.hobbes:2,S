Is there some reason you can't (or don't want to) use ACPI on this machine?

Looks like it tried to access through the stack pointer while executeing 16 bit code.

This is the APM BIOS 16 bit code segment.

Accessing the stack while executing 16 bit code is never going to work.

APM BIOS's are often only tested in real mode as that will suffice for
older Windows systems.  If you machine is less than 6 years old, Windows
is almost certainly using ACPI and not APM.
If you really want this fixedm you will have to talk to your machine
menufacturer (or the BIOS manufacturer).
