 You have an expensive (16x cost of hypercall on some processors) 
privilege transition, you have to decode the instruction, then you have 
to verify protection in the page tables mapping the page allows 
execution (P, !NX, and U/S check).  This is a lot more expensive than a 
hypercall.

The number of reasons for #GP is enormous, and there are too many paths 
to optimize with fast checks.  We do have a fast check for inb/outb; 
it's just not fast enough.
On P4, hypercall entry is 120 cycles.  #GP is about 2000.  Modern 
processors are better, but a hypercall is always faster than a fault.  
Many times, the hypercall can be handled and ready to return before a 
#GP would even complete.
On workloads that sit there and hammer network cards, these costs become 
significant, and latency sensitive network benchmarks suffer.

There are 24 different possible I/O operations; sometimes with a port 
encoded in the instruction, sometimes with input in the DX register, 
sometimes with a rep prefix, and for 3 different operand sizes.
Combine that with the MMU checks required, and it's complex and branchy 
enough to justify short-circuiting the whole thing with a simple hypercall.
