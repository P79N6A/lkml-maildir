Hmmm, I would have the kernel process let the system call bump it out of
wait() rather than delivering a SIGCHLD.  And, I'd be inclined to lomgjmp
over to the kernel stack.
Or, even better, have it already running on the appropriate kernel stack,
so it can just read the system call from PTRACE_GETREGS and call into the
main kernel.
Similarly, with other signals, like the timer, SIGIO, or page faults, it
would just annull the signal and call into the IRQ system.  Although page 
faults will be difficult because of the inability to read err or cr3, as 
you've pointed out.
