Just to be more clear, the assignment (routing) of PATA and SATA ports 
on the ICH5 too dynamic for its own good.  You must deal with
* PATA and SATA on separate PCI devices (as it should be)
* PATA and SATA on the same PCI device, where
	c0 == pata0 master (master), pata1 master (slave)
	c1 == sata0 (master), sata1 (master)
     or
	c0 == pata0 master (master), pata1 master (slave)
	c1 == sata1 (master), sata0 (master)
the ICH6 follows the horror of combined mode, where c0 or c1 might be 
sata ports 0/2 or 1/3 (it has 4 sata ports rather than ICH5's 2).  and 
PATA might be c0 or c1.
(c0 == ata channel zero, c1 == ata channel one)
Sigh.
Although not with libata, with other drivers I belive that combined mode 
is fundamentally flawed.  Pretending a SATA device is a PATA device 
eliminates SATA-specific knowledge, such as avoiding soft-reset (SRST) 
on certain SATA devices, since they will lock up on probe.
I always recommend that users avoid combined mode when their 
configuration permits.
