This patch makes Mozilla fail to load on my system. If I back it out everything
is fine again. No error messages, Mozilla just hangs for about thirty seconds
and exits.
CUPS also hangs at shutdown.
epiphany works both ways.
Running up2date Fedora and current 2.6 kernel.
P4, 2.8 HT, SMP enabled, ACPI
