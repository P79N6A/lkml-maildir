You could try sending a patch that conforms to the following (why don't
we include a comment about this in Documentation/SubmittingPatches?)
This would remove an extra reason why your patch may not have been
accepted.
PATCH(1)                                                 PATCH(1)
NAME
       patch - apply a diff file to an original
...
NOTES FOR PATCH SENDERS
       There  are  several  things you should bear in mind if you
       are going to be sending out patches.
...
       If the recipient is supposed to use the -pN option, do not
       send output that looks like this:
          diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README prog/README
          --- v2.0.29/prog/README   Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997
          +++ prog/README   Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997
       because the two  file  names  have  different  numbers  of
       slashes,  and  different  versions  of patch interpret the
       file names differently.

Also, you should generate the patches without the "/usr/src/" prefix.
So it should look like this:
--- linux/mm/mmap.c.orig	2002-10-14 11:16:40.000000000 +0200
+++ linux/mm/mmap.c	2002-10-14 11:19:32.000000000 +0200
