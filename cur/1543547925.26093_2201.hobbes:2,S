Lots of people (myself included) would like to be able to debug and 
generally hack the Linux kernel but cannot due to lack of time and the
steep learning curve imposed by the lack of a debugger and good 
documentation.
Not everyone has the time or resources to put in the "hard work" now. 
Tools like a KDB would make the kernel a lot more accessible to the 
time-poor.
