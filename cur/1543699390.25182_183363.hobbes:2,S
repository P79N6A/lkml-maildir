The 2.4.23 NFSv3 client does not support READDIRPLUS without extra
patches, so that would explain why you haven't seen the problem before.
Note, though, that those patches have been around for almost 3 years,
and have been tested pretty extensively against Solaris servers. I've
never seen any reports of this particular problem before.
If you'd like to try the 2.4.23 readdirplus patches, then you can find
them as part of
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/Linux-2.4.x/2.4.23-rc1/linux-2.4.23-NFS_ALL.dif
however as I said; given your ethereal dump, I suspect something is
screwed on the server itself...
Cheers,
  Trond
