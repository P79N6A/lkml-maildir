   I'm assuming that walking on average 5-10 pages on a lookup is not
   too big a deal, especially when you use prefetch for the list walk.
Oh no, not this again...
It _IS_ a big deal.  Fetching _ONE_ hash chain cache line
is always going to be cheaper than fetching _FIVE_ to _TEN_
page struct cache lines while walking the list.
Even if prefetch would kill all of this overhead (sorry, it won't), it
is _DUMB_ and _STUPID_ to bring those _FIVE_ to _TEN_ cache lines into
the processor just to lookup _ONE_ page.
Franks a lot,
