That's what I'm trying to avoid doing. ;)
(As an aside, yes, the URL to the previous marc.theaimsgroup thread *is*
what I'm talking about).
It turns out that I *CAN* do it all with iptables *IF* the following
untested code actually works (this assumes that mangle is re-called on
a retransmit)
# If we've already marked this packet, strip/log/send...
iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -p tcp --syn -m mark --mark 99 --ecn-tcp-remove
iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -p tcp --syn -m mark --mark 99 -j LOG
iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -p tcp --syn -m mark --mark 99 -j ACCEPT
# Else tag it - if it makes it on the first try, good. If not, re-enter above
iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -p tcp --syn -m mark --set-mark 99
Does the mangle/output chain get called again for a retransmitted
packet, or only once?
