Please use "modprobe" not "insmod" in examples, and drop the ".o"
extension.

I realize this is traditional.  However, I suggest you:
1) Rename the module to impi_smb.
2) Change the variable names to addr, debug, debug_probe and
   default_probe.
3) Change MODULE_PARM to module_param
4) Get rid of the #ifndef MODULE code.
The results will be symmetry, and less code:
	modprobe ipmi_smb addr=<adapter1>,<i2caddr1>[,<adapter2>,<i2caddr2>[,...]]
		debug=<flags1>,<flags2>...
		default_probe=0 debug_probe=1
and
	boot ipmi_smb.addr=... ipmi_smb.debug=... ipmi.default_probe=0 ipmi.debug_probe=1
Of course, if you really want to you can use module_param_named and
keep the variable names the same as they are now, and "#undef
KBUILD_MODNAME // #define KBUILD_MODNAME ipmi_smb", to avoid renaming
your module.
But I really think the module name wants a revisit (although I have no
idea what it does, so might be wrong).
Cheers!
Rusty.
