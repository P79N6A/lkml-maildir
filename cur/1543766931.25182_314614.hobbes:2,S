Oh - I meant hand calculating the addresses rather than using
the pmd_addr_end and friends... but:

If you can break out exactly what you need, and make that inline
or otherwise available via the correct header, I'm sure it would
have a good chance of being merged.
Keep in mind that you shouldn't introduce an inefficiency to
follow_page, however if that is not possible you could simply
duplicate what you need in a seperate function in mm/memory.c and
use that - better to do it once there than a lot of times in
random places.
