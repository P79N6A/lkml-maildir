Ah yes, dual-mode code.  Should have figured.

Perhaps an even better thing to have would be a wrmsr64() and rdmsr64() 
routines, for the MSRs which genuinely are a 64-bit item.  Splitting 
them up is rather ugly when it's a real 64-bit value.
Then the code would just be:
	/* 32 bits on x64, 64 bits on x86-64 */
	wrmsr64(MSR_NUMBER, (unsigned long)value);
I think the comment would be justified.
If you agree I'll send a patch.
