I spoke silicon too heavy handedly.  The complexity of the issue 
disappears if you take an exception, but rewinding state prior to the 
exception and reissuing is going to be less efficient than getting it 
right the first time, which is something software can always guarantee.  
You need to add more hardware for prediction to get it right all the 
time, and it is not clear the cost of that hardware is justified when 
software can always do the right thing.
