Subject: i8259.c dummy I/O operation?

Hi all,
I just wanted to direct attention to further somewhat wasteful aspects
in kernel code ;)
Since this extra inb() is in IRQ handler hotpath (called at least a
couple hundred times per second without dynticks patch),
it hurts quite obviously, potentially with several hundred CPU cycles
per I/O due to slow PIC access (haven't actually profiled it, though).
This dummy op can be found in i8259.c of i386/, x86_64/ and mips/.
There seem to be no adverse effects on three systems that I tested it on:
- P4 HT
- P3/700
- Athlon on VIA chipset
Comments?
Further testing on various chipsets by more people would also be useful,
I think...
(however testing might be dangerous, of course, since it's a quite invasive
change and might even corrupt data or so!)
Thanks,
Andreas Mohr
P.S.: the outb() change is just a minor comment correction...
