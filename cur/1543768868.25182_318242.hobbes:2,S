I noticed this too.  I can't figure out why it wasn't working before.  I
don't believe the method of loading the kernel (hdd, usb, floppy) would
cause this.  Next week when I get a chance to work more on this project,
I'll wipe out my entire kernel tree (saving the .config) and try again (I
keep pristine sources in /usr/src/linux/dist/<kernel vers>)

gcc (GCC) 3.4.4 20050314 (prerelease) (Debian 3.4.3-12)
I have gcc-3.3 also installed.  Should I use it instead?
I follow the list somewhat (only interesting sujects =) and I have noticed
that 4.0 has some problems.
