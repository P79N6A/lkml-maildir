You don't have to reproduce, your case has two drives on a channel doing
tcq. That's not really supported, and the last patch sent should make
that scenario "work" (by not enabling tcq on any of them).
The DTTA, according to FreeBSD, has a bug with > 64K transfers. But you
said that worked fine, so...
Thanks for the feedback, much appreciated! FWIW, 2 hours of thrashing
the drive here and no problems so far.
