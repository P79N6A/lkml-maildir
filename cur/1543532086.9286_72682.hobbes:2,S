>   PCMCIA crashes on unloading pci_socket
On my system, "rmmod pci_socket" oopses twice.  The problem is that it's
in use by the following two processes:
ps aux | grep Card 
root 348 0.0 0.0 0 0 ?  SW 09:03 0:00 [CardBus Watcher]
root 349 0.0 0.0 0 0 ?  SW 09:03 0:00 [CardBus Watcher]
If I first do a "kill 348 349", then the rmmod pci_socket exits cleanly.
