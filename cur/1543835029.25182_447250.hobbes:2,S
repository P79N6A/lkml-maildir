Yes. But it looks like we'll have a hard time finding this common
interface, due to overlaps and omissions between battery drivers.
So I've proposed /sys/class/battery/{acpi,apm,thinkpad}/BAT?/* as a comrpromise:
A userspace app that only needs a generic voltage readout will try
(all of) /sys/class/battery/*/BAT0/voltage. This is your generic
interface.
A specialized app can be more specific and access
/sys/class/battery/thinkpad/BAT0/force_discharge.
And a complex system monitor like GKrellM will  let you configure a
list of paths, e.g., /sys/class/battery/acpi/BAT0 +
/sys/class/battery/mustek/UPS0.
The only drawback I see is the inelegant userspace code for
enumerating /sys/class/battery/* in languages like C. I suppose this
could be wrapped by a trivial userspace library.

Isn't this an overkill? Battery status changes very slowly, so it
seems perfectly adequate to have the usual userspace daemons poll the
kernel every few seconds. No need for extra kernal event mechanisms,
device file allocation, IOCTLs...

Excellent idea, but it's orthogonal to the API issue. You might as
well have  /sys/class/battery/usespace-battery/UPS0.
