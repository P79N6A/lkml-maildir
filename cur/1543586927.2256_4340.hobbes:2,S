Given your description, this board is certainly not a multi-fonction PCI
device. Multi-function PCI devices provide separate resources for each
function in a way that allows each function to be driven by separate
software drivers. A single function PCI device that provides several
functionnalities commonly handled by separate sub-systems, is nothing but
a bag of shit we should not want to support in any O/S in my opinion.
Let me claim that ingenieers that want O/Ses to support such hardware are
either morons or bastards.

Since the hardware does not allows the software to transparently share the
different functionnalities provided by the silicium, you must handle such
sharing by software. I mean, you must, at least, write a module (or
sub-driver or sub-system) that will handle the sharing of the PCI
function. Band-aiding the kernel code in order to cope with such
brain-deaded hardware would be a pity, in my opinion. Burden must stay
where it is deserved. If they want their 'save 0.01$ but push shit ahead'
hardware to be supported, they should write their drivers themselves, in
my opinion.
