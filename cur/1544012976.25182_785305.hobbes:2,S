Hi all,
I have seen the following message in /var/log/messages file :-
PCI: Device 0000:01:00.0 not available because of resource collisions
Whenever this msg comes, the PCI card which is present in 0000:01:00.0
is not useful/accessible.
While detection of card, pci_set_master() fails.
But after reboot, that msg goes & card is working fine.
This card is a Network controller PCI-Express based card.
The above problem comes very rarely & not on all the test nodes. The
situation may be difficult to reproduce.
So, my question is, what to interpret from the above message ?
PCI bios allocates the PCI resources. So where to look to remove this error ?
TIA,
Yogeshwar
