postmark is a single threaded benchmark.
The ext3 filesystem free blocks counter is mostly being updated at block
allocation and free code. So, a test with many many threads doing block
allocation/deallocation simultaneously will stress the free blocks
counter accounting better than a single threaded fs benchmark. After
all, the main reason we choose to use percpu counter for the free blocks
counter at the first place, I believe, was to support parallel block
allocation. 
I would suggest run tiobench with many threads (>256), or even better,
run tiobench with many dd tests at the background.
