Hi Neil,
	There are several problems with this patch.  Ignoring the fact
that you use __module_get.  Firstly, you bump the module count
permentantly while the thread is running: how does it ever get
unloaded?  Secondly, modprobe becomes your parent.
	There have been ambitious attempts to do a nice "thread
creation and stopping" interface before.  Given the delicate logic
involved in shutting threads down, I think this makes sense.  Maybe
something like: 
/* Struct which identifies a kernel thread, handed to creator and
   thread. */
struct kthread
{
	int pid;
	int should_die; /* Thread should exit when this is set. */
	/* User supplied arg... */
	void *arg;
};
struct kthread *create_thread(int (*fn)(struct kthread*), void *arg, 
			      unsigned long flags,
			      const char *namefmt, ...);
void cleanup_thread(struct kthread *);
create_thread would use keventd to start the thread, and stop_thread
would tell keventd to set should_die, wmb(), wake it up, and
sys_wait() for it.
Thoughts?
Rusty.
