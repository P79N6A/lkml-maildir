I'll just let you know (in secret) one of the graphs that Arne sent me
today ...
  
http://web.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/~wiebalck/results/plots/disk_net_GbE.pdf
I don't know the details of this experiment, but it's a push of data
over the Giga-net through ENBD to a server with a modern VM. I think
the timing on the server graph is slightly shifted .. I believe it's
been shown in other experiments that the server disk i/o blocks first,
and then the network backs up afterwards.
