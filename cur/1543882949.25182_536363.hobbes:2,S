Yes, it does.

Please note that even accessing a file may be a permanent change.

In that case, I would agree.  Currently, however, we're not even close to this
point.
The checkpointing of filesystems would be a very welcome feature, but there's
no anyone working on it right now, AFAICT.

Yes, we can do that, in principle, and screw all of the current users in the
process.  And finally we'd end up with something similar to what is done now,
IMHO.
And no, the things are not just totally broken, as it may follow from these
discussions.  The problem is that the people who are discussing them so
viciously have never tried to write anything like the hibernation code.
This is as though as I were discussing the design of the CPU schedulers,
although I only know how they work on a general level.
Actually, the really problematic thing with the hibernation _right_ _now_ is
what Linus is so concerned about (and rightfully so) - that we use the
same device drivers' callbacks for the hibernation and suspend (aka s2ram).
The other things work quite well and are really robust.
