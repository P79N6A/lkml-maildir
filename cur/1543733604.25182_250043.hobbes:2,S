You could actually use two S_IFXXX types - one for stream files which
should be archived by backup programs because they contain real
information, and a different one for stream files which should not be
archived because they are merely a different "view" of data from the main
file. This simplifies the archival problem because legacy programs would
complain that the file types aren't handled - alerting the user to
potential data loss, and updated programs would automatically backup only
the attributes that are required.
