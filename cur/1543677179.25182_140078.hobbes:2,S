Since version 2.5.69 (now with 2.5.70-mm6), I'm having trouble using lilo. 
Every time I try to change the lilo boot, the boot menu is either not 
changed, or it's corrupted. It looks like if Lilo doesn't manage to 
completely write the boot sector.
I've been looking around, but I haven't found any information about this. Has 
anything changed in the latest versions? Are there any patches that I need to 
apply to lilo to make it work now? 
Thanks in advance
