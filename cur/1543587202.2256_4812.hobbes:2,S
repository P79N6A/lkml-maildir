Hi,
I encountered a problem with 2.4 kernels today.
Decompressing a 60+ Mb file with bzip2, residing on a vfat partition, gave
errors reporting that the archive was corrupt.
When I rebooted into windows and ran scandisk it couldn't find any problem
with the partition. That made me suspicious...
I rebooted into an leftover 2.2.18, ran "bunzip -t" on the file, and all was
fine. Rebooted back into 2.4.3, bunzip gave errors. Tried 2.4.2 (had an image
of that left around as well), errors too.
I copied the file (in 2.2.18) to my ext2 partition, tested it with bzip2 in
the 2.4 kernels and all was fine - so it is most likely a vfat related
problem.
Also, the file was written to the vfat partition in 2.4.2, so writing may not
even be affected by this possible bug.
Regards,
Filip
