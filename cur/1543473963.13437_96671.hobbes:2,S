Please re-read the quoted part of my original statement.  The key part 
begins with the word "None", since you apparently missed it the first time 
and need a pointer.
Why should config.guess care what vendor variant of Linux is used?  It's 
mostly irrelevant; the differences are things which differ on other systems 
as well and therefore should be tracked by non-Linux-specific rules.  There 
should not be a vendor in the usual sense there at all for Linux --- it 
exists mainly to deal with silliness like multiple mutations of System V and 
4.xBSD as put out by various commercial vendors, each with their own 
mostly-incompatible proprietary value-added.
(config.guess rant:  *why* the exact processor ID?  About half of configure 
scripts fall over in ECE Linux builds because they don't expect "i686".  
This should be "x86".  And if it has to be exact, where are AMD and Cyrix?)
IOW the correct config.guess triple *should* be "x86-pc-linux".  Or 
"x86-gnu-linux"; an accurate statement, since the userspace code is 
something like 85% FSF code (and this nicely ends the current argument).  
"i?86-pc-linux-gnu" is silly, and "i?86-{redhat,suse,...}-linux{,-gnu}" is 
sillier.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
