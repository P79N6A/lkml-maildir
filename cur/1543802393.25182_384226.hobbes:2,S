And OSS/ALSA is an example why this is not a good thing:
- OSS in the kernel is unmaintained
- people forced to use OSS drivers can't use applications only 
  supporting ALSA
In the OSS/ALSA case this was not avoidable since OSS was for a long 
time the sound system in the kernel, and ALSA came later.
But if you have the possibility to choose which stack to use at the 
beginning (as in the wireless case), the only reasonable solution is to 
choose _one_ stack.
