Looks fairly reasonable to me. However, I suspect any use of _GTM is 
somewhat dangerous (at least after the resume) unless we use the _STM 
and _GTF methods in the proper sequence when resuming. (Is that in the 
-mm tree now?)
Keep in mind that in the pata_acpi case where we don't do anything to 
program the hardware directly, we can still use _STM to program a lower 
speed than the BIOS chose if we decide to do this. Windows does indeed 
do this (you can force PIO mode in the control panel, and it will also 
reduce UDMA speeds or drop to PIO if there are too many CRC errors or 
timeouts), so this should be safe. We just had better be sure that the 
speed we give it is valid, since there is no sane way for the function 
to indicate failure. (Thus the problem with the "cram in all possible 
values to see what it supports" strategy for determining mode limits..)
