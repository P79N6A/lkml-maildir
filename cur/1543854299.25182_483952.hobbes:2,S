Same OpenPIC.. it can deal with both INTACK cycles and reading from an
INTACK register. On some PPC's, we actually have logic in the bridge to
generate the INTACK cycle (which exist on PCI) though we only use that
with 8259's currently as it's not really more efficient than just
reading from the INTACK register of the OpenPIC.
