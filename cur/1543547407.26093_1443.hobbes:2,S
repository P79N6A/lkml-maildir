Yes, and that's what I plan for 2.5: Redoing the shm filesystem part
like (or in?) ramfs and better separation of both the VM part and the
SYSV API part.
I always objected against doing anonymous shared mmap over SYSV shared
mem because I wanted to have this handling in the VM layer and _not_
in some horrible^wspecial API layer.
So my goal would be:
1) anonymous shared mappings should be handled by the vm layer (with
   better integration into the pagecache)
2) the filesystem frontend should be redone to make more use of the
   VFS.
3) SYSV shm should only be a special API using this functionality
