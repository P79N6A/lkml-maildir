Hello to all.
I'm running an application that uses several IO boards in a PCI bus.
My main problem is the virtual IRQ sharing between several boards.
I mean for example:
	1 ethernet board IRQ = 169;
	1 ADC card IRQ         = 169;
I want to get ride of this behaviour, and changing the slot position of each 
board is not enought, to get something like (for example):
	1 ethernet board IRQ = 169;
	1 ADC card IRQ         = 170;
Where in the kernel i can see the algorithms for the APIC system where the 
virtual IRQs are distributed? Or exist already any patch that permits to 
solve my problem?
I'm using kernel 2.6.16.27, in a single machine with Intel pentium IV 
processor and chipset ICH4.
Thanks for any reply.
Greetings.
