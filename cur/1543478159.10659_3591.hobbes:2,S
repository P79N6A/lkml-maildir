Yes, I never thought it was a fault thing.

Sure it is. One of the 486 pins (where is my databook) is a FPU enable
pin. Just cut it in the final steps of making the package (or sever the
pin)

Major profit can be made by having two 'lines' one for the people who can
afford expensive things, one for everyone else. Two assembly lines, and
designs are expensive though.. So, you make the better one (because they
all sell for 100x their manufacturing cost, and it costs about the same
for both) and handicap some of them depending on demand.

I've opened up 486 chips and between a SX and a DX of about the same age..
There is not any visiable difference in the die..
The design of a FPUless one would have blown away their extra profits from
the cheaper chip making better sales.
