This won't work on big AMD boxes I think. They don't have a XAPIC.
The other subarchitectures (es7000,summit) are usually selected using ACPI 
OEM tablesnow, you would need to make sure that it happens after that.
Can you check that the there is really an XAPIC compatible APIC
somewhere in the system? (e.g. by reading the version number from the APIC?)
Then I guess it would be ok.
