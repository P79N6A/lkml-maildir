If Linus/DaveM really don't like -pre/-rc naming, I think 2.6.x.y is 
preferable to even/odd.
Just create a 2.6.X repo at each release.  For bug fixes to 2.6.X, 
commit to this repo, then pull into linux-2.6.  For everything else, 
pull straight into linux-2.6.
The linux-2.6 repo would be upstream, and linux-2.6.X repo would be 
where bugfix-only releases come from.
