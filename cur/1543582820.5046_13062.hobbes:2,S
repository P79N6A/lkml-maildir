I have come to the pont of having to mail this list in search of a greater
understanding of what I could possibably be doing wrong in reguards to 
enabling my sound card.  Under 2.2.X I was able to include the cards 
configuration during the config, yes, I understand that this has changed
in opt for other methods.  These methods though are very strange and 
somewhat unclear in the current documentation set.  I have tried several
possible built-in and modular configs with the results being the same, below 
I will include information that may or may not be what is necessary to get 
possible solutions to this, but odd or exact suggestions will be greatly 
appreciated.  Thank you,  Phil Smith
The mother board is a pr440fx intel board.

initial lines from /proc/isapnp   (all sound card coresponding devices
show as "not active"  activation can be achieved via isapnptools and
no sound working from that):
Card 1 'CSC0b35:CS4236B Audio' PnP version 1.0 Product version 0.1

P.S. I perfer to not use modules for sound, that may be odd, I'm not sure 
about that, but I see no reason why what I have chosen to use, not to work, 
I can only hope that I have missed an important note somewhere and a simple 
answer will raise its head.
