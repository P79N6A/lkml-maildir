The current implementation of "adjtime(const struct timeval *delta, 
struct timeval *olddelta)" uses the kernel function adjtimex(struct 
timex *tx).
The adtime() syscall allows four combinations for its arguments:
number	delta	olddelta
------------------------
1)	NULL	NULL
2)	NULL	!NULL
3)	!NULL	NULL
4)	!NULL	!NULL
Case 1) is a no-op, cases 3) and 4) are the regular cases. 
Unfortunately 2) has a problem:
With only one argument passed to adjtimex, usually the "first", the 
routine can't return information if that pointer is NULL. And if the 
pointer is not NULL, it will always do an adjustment. Saying "0" for 
the adjustment will stop any adjustment in progress.
While the clean solution would be to have seperate functions for the 
three basic flavours of adjtimex(), I can imagine a working solution:
Introduce some magic adjustment value like "-1 microsecond" that is 
ignored for an adjustment. That way a non-destructive readout can be 
performed by adjtimex() when the wrapper is doing the interface right.
If you really want to do a "-1us" adjustment, the wrapper could to a 
"-2us" adjustment followed by a "+1us" adjustment (after a pause of 
one timer interrupt). For compatibility there is one flaw: If a large 
adjustment is in progress, and you want to make the tiny "-1us" 
adjustment, it would be ignored, letting the huge one finish. That's 
why I thought "0" is not the best magic value. Also using a larger 
value for the magic number seems dangerous.
Opinions?
