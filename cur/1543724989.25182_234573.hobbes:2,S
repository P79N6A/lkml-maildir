Long, welcome back.  I will review your patch as soon as I have a
little free time.

I think it's OK to keep track of which MSI/MSI-X vectors have ISRs
attached and which don't.  However I don't think free_irq() should
return a vector to the free pool (that might be used by other
devices).  In other words it should be OK for a correct driver to do
	pci_enable_msix(pdev...);
	request_irq(msix_vector1);
	free_irq(msix_vector1);
	request_irq(msix_vector1);
	free_irq(msix_vector1);
	pci_disable_msix(pdev...);
(obviously with some code in between operations).
I think we agree on this and I will read your code to find out what
you actually do but I just wanted to make my proposed interface clear.
Thanks,
  Roland
