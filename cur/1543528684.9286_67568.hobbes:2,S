Yes, just did.  It is the same.  I do think it should be replaced with
skb->len.  I mean, we have it in memory, it is already computed, why do
another set of subtraction and dereferencing?
It seems that since it is a "complete packet" that cipe doesn't like not
expanding upon whatever it was it was handed.  For example:
If I remove the comments around the if's the code never gets run.  
        max_headroom = (((tdev->hard_header_len+15)&~15)+cipehdrlen+
                        ((tunnel->sockshost) ? sizeof(struct sockshdr) :
0));
        max_tailroom = (tunnel->havekey) ? cipefootlen : 0;
                printk(KERN_ERR "%s: max_headroom %d, skb_headroom
%d\n", dev->name, max_headroom, skb_headroom(skb));
                printk(KERN_ERR "%s: max_tailroom %d, skb_tailroom
%d\n", dev->name, max_tailroom, skb_tailroom(skb));
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE > KERNEL_VERSION(2,3,35)
/*      if (max_headroom > skb_headroom(skb)
            || max_tailroom > skb_tailroom(skb)) */
        {
            struct sk_buff *n= skb_copy_expand(skb, max_headroom,
                                               max_tailroom,
GFP_ATOMIC);

Is the output in syslog.
I am sorry to have wasted everyone's time.  It seems I had this problem
and one ordering problem.  They are now fixed.
I appreciate you all.  Olaf Titz, expect a patch against
cipe-snapshot-20000305 momentarily.  This patch will make it work (I
believe flawlessly) with 2.3.x.  Though I am getting:
Removing existing cipe interface(s).
Setting up cipe interface(s): /etc/cipe/options.ITDOY internal error:
307

P.S. In skb_copy_expand it uses skb->tail - skb->data which is correct
after all, but I don't see why we don't just use skb->len when it is
correct to begin with!
