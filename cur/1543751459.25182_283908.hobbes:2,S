Why should we keep junk around for 12 months that nobody has a legal
reason to be using ? We broke every out of serial tty driver in 2.6.9
and in 2.6.10 for example and we will break them all again in ways we
can't keep the old stuff around. (and Linus broke them all in 2.6.10 8))
There is a difference between a public API like inter_module_get() and
an internal deep reference to something that is fairly private. Zapping
those kind of functions is very different and I agree we should
deprecate them properly.
A lot of this is coming up because old exports for private use were
never really properly marked as _GPL or in other ways so we have a
legacy of assumptions to tidy.
