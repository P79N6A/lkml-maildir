That's one fairly complicated way of going about it.
Simpler is three points: init, stop, destroy.  Stop is that part before
you call synchronise_kernel() - it's not something you can turn back
from.
If somebody needs the module, and it currently inside its
cleanup_module() function, they simply wait until destroy finishes, and
the module is unloaded, and then _reload_ the module from scratch.  So,
let the disk I/O happen.  This is a rare.

Not at all.  Keep request_module() simple, and change module loading,
like this:
   1. Just before a module's cleanup_module() function is called, mark
      the module as "unloading".  This should force
      try_inc_mod_use_count() to fail, causing its caller to behave like
      the associated resource (e.g. filesystem) isn't actually
      registered, and to call request_module().
   2. request_module() should simply ignore modules marked as
      "unloading".  It should proceed to call "insmod" etc.
   3. sys_create_module() or sys_init_module() should block if there is
      a module of the same name currently in the "unloading" state.
      They should block until that module's cleanup_module() returns.
   4. At this point, the new instance of the module will initialise,
      request_module() calls will return and the callers which called
      try_inc_mod_use_count() in step 1 will continue with the resource
      they needed.

I don't see the point in this at all.  What half-loaded problem?  If a
module is destroyed, then reloaded and fails to initialise properly:
tough.  It lost the resources fair and square.

What do you think of the idea described above?: To mark modules as
"unloading" (as we do now), use synchronise_kernel() for an rcu-style
safety pause (as you suggested), and change module loading so that a
dying module is waited for before its replacement takes over?
