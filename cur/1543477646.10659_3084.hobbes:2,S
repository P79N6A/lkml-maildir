I'm getting the same behaviour on the same machine (but with
celeron-300a).
The kernel message is a "keyboard timeout [2]", just after the apm bios
message.
If i get this once, the keyboard will work correctly.
It i get it twice it wont work at all.
The bootup password (CMOS) is enabled.
The keyboard is a compaq kb-3926.
I'm using kernel 2.2.0pre7-ac2, compiled UP.
It "seemed" (no heavy testing) to happen less on kernel 2.2.0pre6-ac2.
If anyone needs any extra info just ask.
