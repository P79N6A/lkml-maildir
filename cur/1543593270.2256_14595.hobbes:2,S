Subject: unresolved symbol on tcp_proxy_sendmsg()

Hi all!
I wrote a function under 2.4.4 which simply mimics the behaviour of
tcp_sendmsg() but with zerocopy (uses do_tcp_send_pages()).
I also added the function to the netsyms.c file & then compiled the kernel &
booted from it.
when I try to insmod a module which simply makes a call to my function, I
get an unresolved symbol.
help will be mostly appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
--Alon
