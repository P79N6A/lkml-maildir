Thanks for doing this.

I think the name should be different.  user-mount-max?
Acutally the accounting in your patch is a little odd, we account for
all mounts, and after mount-max is reached user mounts are denied.
Shouldn't we account only for user mounts?

minor nipick - please keep a empty line before the function here.
Also I wonder whether we should have struct mounts_stat_struct at all,
just having two variables seems a lot saner to me.

although it won't have different results I'd reorder this to make reading
more easy:
	if ((nd.mnt->mnt_owner != current->user || (flags & MNT_FORCE)) &&
	    !capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN))

Currently we do allow bind mounts over every type of file for the super
user.  I think we should keep allowing that.  Also I think this function
wants a really big comment explaining all the rules for user mounts.
