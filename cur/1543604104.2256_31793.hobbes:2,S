The problem may well be in the memory balancing Andrea, but I'm not trying
to hide it with the infinite loop.
The infinite loop is just a guarantee that we'll have a reliable way of
throttling the allocators which can block. Not doing the infinite loop is
just way too fragile IMO and it is _prone_ to fail in intensive
loads. 
If the problem is the highmem balancing, I'll love to get your fixes and
integrate with the infinite loop logic, which is a separated (related,
yes, but separate) thing.
