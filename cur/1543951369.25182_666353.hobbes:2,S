That seems quite reasonable.  This "feels" like a threshold-too-low problem.

My workflow generally looks like this:
	# repo was created in this manner....  this was done ONCE,
	# not every time I apply patches
	git clone --reference ../linux-2.6 ../linux-2.6 libata-dev
	# a patch-applying session
	git checkout master
	git pull ../linux-2.6
	git fetch --tags ../linux-2.6	# yes, still necessary...
	git branch -D ALL NEXT
	git branch -D upstream-fixes upstream-linus
	git checkout -b upstream-fixes master
	git-am --utf8 --signoff -i /g/tmp/mbox	# repeat many times...
	git branch upstream-linus upstream-fixes
	git-checkout sii-lbt && git-rebase master
	git-checkout mv-ahci-pata && git-rebase master
	git-checkout new-eh && git-rebase master
	git branch NEXT master
	git branch ALL new-eh
	git checkout master
	git prune
	git push --force --all $URL
Thus, 'git prune' is run on a very regular basis, but 'git gc' is not.
However, I presume the lack of 'git gc' regularity on libata-dev.git is 
mitigated by the fact that I _do_ run 'git gc' regularly on 
linux-2.6.git (listed in libata-dev's alternatives, as noted by 
git-clone statement above)

[jgarzik@pretzel libata-dev]$ git count-objects -v
count: 51
size: 244
in-pack: 475
packs: 4
prune-packable: 0
garbage: 0
[jgarzik@pretzel libata-dev]$ git fsck-objects
[jgarzik@pretzel libata-dev]$
As an aside...  a git-debug-info might be a useful command, wrapping up 
everything you (a git developer) would find interesting from me (a 
humble and appreciative git user).  Users could attach the output from 
git-debug-info to emails, when discussing problems in their repositories.
