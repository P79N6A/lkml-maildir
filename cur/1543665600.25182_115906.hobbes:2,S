Hi Linus,
	Could you please do the following (I don't know how to express
it in bitkeeper):
chmod a+r drivers/char/agp/i7x05-agp.c
chmod a+r drivers/char/agp/generic-3.0.c
chmod a+r drivers/input/joystick/grip_mp.c
chmod a+r include/video/neomagic.h
	These four files are shipped in your kernel tar distributions
as not globally readable.
