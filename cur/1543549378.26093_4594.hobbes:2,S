Hi,
I removed some messages from my netscape communicator 4.75 
Inbox (25Mb), then I "Compacted all folders". The machine 
froze rock solid.
After a reboot I tried to open (using netscape) the temporary
netscape mailbox (Inbox.<pid>.0) the crash left in nsmail/. 
The system froze again. Today, before switching back to 
test9-pre1, I had another (mail-related ?, this
time I was using pine) crash.
My machine is a dell inspiron7000 laptop with 192Mb ram. 
BTW. I am using 2.4.0-test6 on a 4 way dell server. It runs
well most of the time. However sometimes (the first time 
after 14 days of uptime, then after a week and finally after 4 days)
it simply hangs.
The screen is black. No diagnostic messages anywhere. 
SysRq does not work. The only solution is to cycle-power.
