My BIOS is the latest version available from the laptop vendor. The laptop has 
some minor but peculiar issues - If I boot into Windows XP all works fine all 
the times (With USB HDD on during boot). If  I then restart the machine 
(without turning off) and boot into Linux - Linux doesn't detect my keyboard. 
I have power it off and reboot, only then it will detect the keyboard. So I 
wouldn't say the machine is 100% defect free but Windows has a way to work 
around it.
This current problem of Hang-On-Boot if USB drive is attached does not happen 
with Windows - so it is some sort of additional (unnecessary?) thing which 
Linux does and the BIOS doesn't like.  (Like re-enabling the controller even 
if BIOS has already enabled it or some such.)
