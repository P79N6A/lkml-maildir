I'd rather change the structure passed via the platform device to
something like:
struct platform_serial_data {
	void	(*pm)(struct uart_port *port, unsigned int state, unsigned int old);
	int	nr_ports;
	struct plat_serial8250_port *ports;
};
which also eliminates the empty plat_serial8250_port terminator from
all the serial8250 platform devices (which appears to have caused some
folk problems.)
It does mean that a set of 8250 ports (grouped by each platform device)
have a common power management method - which seems a logical restriction.
