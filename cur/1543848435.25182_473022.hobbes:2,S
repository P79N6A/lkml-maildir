I agree with that, so I think Al (whom I cc'ed) will be able to evaluate this.
 - however I think that the problem with volatile is that it does not have any 
semantic wrt cache - volatile does not even work with host-to-device 
operation (the thing it was thought for) if you have reasonable caches - 
unless the var is in a MMIO region with disabled caches.
So relying on volatile for variables shared between threads is not useful.
Note that raw_spinlock_t counter is volatile, however - separate caches 
flushes or atomic operations are needed, but it may avoid the need for a full 
barrier() operation or a volatile "memory" clobber - GCC knows only the 
volatile object has changed, while with barrier() it must assume everything 
must be reloaded. However, at least one barrier operation is needed for a 
spinlock to prevent GCC from moving code outside of critical sections.
