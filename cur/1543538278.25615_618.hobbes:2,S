This has been happening on and off for months, all through the 2.1.x and
2.2.x series. Initially I suspected bad simms but they've been replaced
twice and guy says the ones I returned fully checks out.
Changed power supply a few months ago, didn't solve the problem.
I now strongly suspect the household power supply this time and I'm
wondering if a decent UPS unit would solve the problem by cleaning up the
supply.
Cheers, 
Alex
