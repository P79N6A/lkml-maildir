I would suggest that, since you already know that the machine hangs when
it's doing something to the video, yet it boots on other machines, you
swap your video card.
There is a place in video.S, line 758, where the contents of the
screen regen buffer are saved, then restored. You can comment out
both the save and restore _calls_ in earlier code. Just use a '#'
character to comment out the call. This will eliminate the possibility
that somebody is copying screen-data over something important.
The code is "strange" in several places where data are just written
to some numbered offset (gawd). This makes proper data allocation very
difficult to confirm.
