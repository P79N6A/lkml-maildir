netatalk uses its own resource fork magic using .AppleDouble directories
or a few other configurable formats. HFS on 2.2 also supports the same
format so magically you can get real fork access
For 2.4 the HFS code still needs some serious cleanup, and for 2.5 I suspect
either someone fixes the locking on or it gets deleted
