Post August, this user space interface patch has received (a) silence or 
(b) this vague general worry about changing user space interfaces.  All 
the while it is working and was revised according to comment at the time.
At some point you gotta stop waiting for perfection or that mythical 
"when I get a round tuit" and actually DO something.
When I see the new patch to end CD-ROM polling grow moldy for two months 
while rewrites to ancient SCSI drivers go in, I throw up my hands in 
wonderment.  Poor Andrew is constantly resending -mm patches to you -- 
some stick, some vanish into the ether without comment.  For months.

You're talking about long term directions, I'm talking about actually 
getting day-to-day work accomplished.
