I checked the Intel datasheets now. Problem is that they define this
register as read-only, and the only way to access it works using
a very chipset specific way (alternative LPC interface) 
So it's impossible to check the old value. The original code is the only
way to do this (if it's even needed, Intel also doesn't say anything
about this bit being a flip-flop). Only possible change would be to 
write an alternative index.
