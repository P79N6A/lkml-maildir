OK, in ipv4_local_port_range() we have 
                if (range[1] <= range[0])
                        ret = -EINVAL;
which will prevent the crashes.
But is it good to disallow high=low?  This disallows a port range of one
single port.  Unless "high" is exclusive.  But
Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt says
: ip_local_port_range
: -------------------
:
: Range of  ports  used  by  TCP  and UDP to choose the local port. Contains two
: numbers, the  first  number  is the lowest port, the second number the highest
: local port.  Default  is  1024-4999.  Should  be  changed  to  32768-61000 for
: high-usage systems.
ie: inclusive.
Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt says
: ip_local_port_range - 2 INTEGERS
: 	Defines the local port range that is used by TCP and UDP to
: 	choose the local port. The first number is the first, the 
: 	second the last local port number. Default value depends on
: 	amount of memory available on the system:
: 	> 128Mb 32768-61000
: 	< 128Mb 1024-4999 or even less.
: 	This number defines number of active connections, which this
: 	system can issue simultaneously to systems not supporting
: 	TCP extensions (timestamps). With tcp_tw_recycle enabled
: 	(i.e. by default) range 1024-4999 is enough to issue up to
: 	2000 connections per second to systems supporting timestamps.
also inclusive.
