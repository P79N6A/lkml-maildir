These additional features bring up another issue that we may want the driver
model to handle.  Basically, I think we should allow devices to be started and
stopped.
So it would look something like this:
struct device_driver {
	char			* name;
	struct bus_type		* bus;
	struct semaphore	unload_sem;
	struct kobject		kobj;
	struct list_head	devices;
	int	(*probe)	(struct device * dev);
	int	(*start)	(struct device * dev); <-----
	int	(*stop)		(struct device * dev); <-----
	int 	(*remove)	(struct device * dev);
	void	(*shutdown)	(struct device * dev);
	int	(*suspend)	(struct device * dev, u32 state, u32 level);
	int	(*resume)	(struct device * dev, u32 level);
};
"*probe"
- determine if this driver is able to handle this device
- if so create data structures that can store information about the device
- bind the device to the driver and display additional config attributes.
At this point userspace can set up the configuration of this specific binding
instance.  The configuration options would primarily be things that cannot be
modified while the device is in use.  It can be loaded from a cache so that it
is consistent between reboots, hotplugs etc.  This would sort of replace
module parameters.
Now that the user has specific his or her config preferences we can go to
"*start"
"*start"
- parse resource information
- fill in device/driver data structures with information
- prepare the device to actually be used
From this point the device would be completely usable.
Then at a later time, when the device...
- is no longer needed
- resources need to be rebalanced
- the user wants to remove the device in the near future
"*stop"
- safely stop the upper class layer
- free resources, and reset device specific data
And we're ready for the next step. (which may even include another *start)
This would easily allow for things like "reconnect", which would simply be a
"*stop" follow by a "*start".

That's actually a really interesting idea.  In some cases we may not want the
kernel automatically binding drivers.  A question would be should this feature
be disabled on a per device basis or globally?  If it's globally then should
it occur after init is done.  And if that's the case, couldn't we free the
device ID tables and handle everything from userspace.  I'm sure there are
some problems with this but I figured I'd mention it as well.
Thanks,
Adam
