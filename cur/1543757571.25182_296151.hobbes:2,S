I won't look back to see where the error came from :) But
yeah it is equally (if not more) likely to have come from
me. And it probably did happen because all the code is
slightly different and hard to understand.

But even in that case, it will still be better to have the

It is not so much a matter of changing, so much as having 10
slightly different implementations.
I think it should be easier to go from the iterators patch to
perhaps more complex iterators, or some open coding, etc etc.
rather than try to put a big complex pt walker on top of these
10 different open coded implementations.
But perhaps I'm missing something you're not - I'd need to see
the lazy walking code I guess.
