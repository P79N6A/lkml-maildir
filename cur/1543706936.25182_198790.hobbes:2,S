I'm running RAID-1 on ICH5, 82801EB. One SATA and one IDE drive in array.
Hyperthread enabled CPU.
Is this right? My ATA drive is on ide0. Because of the RAID my IDE and SATA
drives should have about the same number of interrupts. But half of my IDE
interrupts are showing up on ide1, on CPU #1. There shouldn't be any interrupts
showing up on CPU#1 with hyperthreading.
