Eric,
What I see on linux-kernel is you writing long diatribes, and then
promptly ignoring feedback from kernel developers who would actually be
using your system.  After months and months of being told that
Configure.help needed to be split up, you just continued to whine. 
Linus finally sat down and did it himself.  Back in December, Linus
talked about per-driver and/or per-subsystem metadata files, which would
contain (among other things) the config information.  That seems like a
sane option to me, and other developers agreed.  You ignored that too.
With regards to kbuild (not CML2), Keith publicly stated he didn't care
about 2.5.
I feel sorry about that you have troubled Dirk, without giving him all
the facts.
	Jeff
