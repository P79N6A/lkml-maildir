That garbled message was probably sent using Netscape.
Netscape mail has a Scramble ROTC+13 (something like that) which
turns a message to garbage, this is probably a for of
encryption.
Try Unscambling this message -> right click on the message in
Netscape select unscramble and you should get it back.
