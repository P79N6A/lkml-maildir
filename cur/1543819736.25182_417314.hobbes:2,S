The purpose of d_path is to give user information about a path, to be
used in things like procfs output.  For everything else it's fundamentally
broken and shouldn't be used.  And for exactly that reason it isn't used for
anything like that in the whole tree (except the possible fishy use in nfsd).
p.s.: I also see that your patch doesn't include on to export d_path so
couldn't actually use it anyway. Not that a patch to export it would ever
be ACKed for above reasons..
