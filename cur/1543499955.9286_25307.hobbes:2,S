For IO-intensive applications that handle multiple requests from different
clients at once, queued/asynchronous IO (*without* requiring a system call
for every single operation) could work well. IMHO the basic design rule is
to never ever put a synchronous bottleneck at all into your interface -
all synchronous jobs must be done local (no XInternAtoms and that like
;-). This means that one can completely forget about the Unix API as OS
interface - this is far too local stuff.

In my experience (and that of a good friend of mine who manages a 100+
controller cluster for over 10 years), sending program snippets around
works best, performance- and bandwidth-reduction-wise. Security however
costs performance, so these things are perhaps better for controlled
environments than for a general purpose OS which has to face a lot of
nasty things.
