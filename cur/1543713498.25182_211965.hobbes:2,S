Subject: Stupid question re: register_cdrom()

Let's say I was coding a cdrom emulator in software for kernel 2.4.  I
am unclear about register_cdrom().  Does register_cdrom() in
cdrom.c take care of telling the kernel that my kdev_t major/minor
combination in fact leads to a real driver?  Or do I need to take care of
that outside of regsiter_cdrom()?
If not.. how do I tell the kernel data structures that my driver's major
number does in fact point to a cdrom driver.  Basically, I want my
driver's major number to show up in /proc/devices..
This might be a stupid question, but I am not a linux kernel expert...
Thanks for your patience!
