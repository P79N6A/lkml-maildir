You're absolutely right...
Nobody forces us to use Linux in the credit-card terminals I'm currently
working on; of course we could have selected a proprietary solution (and
we would be forced to, were the Linux kernel and/or certain crucial
libraries or utilities GPLv3 only). 
Only, your statement above seems to run counter to your previous claims
that the "anti-tivoisation" provisions of GPLv3 would bring _more_
developers to copyleft software.
So which one is it?
Cheers
