Use a null modem to the other system and boot with 
console=ttyS0,baudrate
Then use some logging terminal program (e.g. kermit) 
on the other side to catch the output.
Before doing this verify in a working system that the cable works.
If that is not possible you can use a digital camera in the worst
case and put the jpeg somewhere.
