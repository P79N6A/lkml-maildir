Hi Jeff,
The latest version of my kernel '.config' file is
at the end of the file:
http://launchers.tripod.com/linux/libretto_logs_n_kernelconfig.txt
> Suggestions:

Originally CONFIG_PCI_GOANY was set by default. I tried
to unset and I have set it again as you suggest, but
there seems to be no difference in dmesg and dump_irq.

The problem is that there is no documented way to enter
a BIOS setup for this machine. Settings such as the
boot sequence are done from a Windows application :-(
I will try to ask Toshiba if there are any undocumented
possibilities - but it would be a surprise.
Thanks & Cheers!
Aron
