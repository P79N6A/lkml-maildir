Drive Firmware Quality Upgrade
   Updated November 11, 1996
   During extensive quality testing procedures, Western Digital has
   identified an error recovery issue that affects less than 0.1% of a
   very specific group of WD Caviar hard drives. As part of our ongoing
   commitment to quality, we have developed a drive firmware utility that
   corrects the error recovery code in the WD Caviar hard drives listed
   below. Even though this issue affects an extremely small number of
   drives, we highly recommend that you upgrade your drive firmware using
   this utility.
     * AC11000 (1.0 GB)
     * AC22100 (2.1 GB)
     * AC32500 (2.5 GB)
     * AC33100 (3.1 GB)
Since they do not change the name based on the firmware, then there is not
a clean way to flag fuzzy drives that may or may not work.
If it works, edit ./drivers/block/ide-dma.c and delete the offending line.
Better yet create a scheme for testing all various chipset/drive
combinations and impose speed limits.
I have the code for setting speed limits at boot, but it is not generally
called so it waits for 2.3.X
