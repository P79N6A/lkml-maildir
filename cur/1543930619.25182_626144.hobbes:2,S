btw., how extensive are those cleanups and fixes in reality, is there a 
rollup somewhere one could take a look at? Those fixes and cleanups were 
deferred to v2.6.25 in the knowledge of having the current code included 
in v2.6.24 - but now that the current approach seems to regress, maybe 
those cleanups are still safe enough. (compared to an outright revert)
