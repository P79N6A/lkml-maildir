- [DVB] after the firmware removal, split av7110.c into separate modules:
        - av7110.c: initialization and demux stuff
        - av7110_hw.c: lowlevel hardware access and firmware interface
        - av7110_ca.c: CI and ECD
        - av7110_av.c: audio/video MPEG decoder and remuxing stuff
        - av7110_v4l.c: v4l interface
- [DVB] av7110 fixes that were notcies during splitup
        - rename some non-static functions to enhance readability
        - lots of coding style & whitespace fixes
        - return -ERESTARTSYS from ci_ll_read/write() if interrupted
        - use time_after() for timeouts
        - added some comments about firmware interface
        - removed some unused fields from struct av7110, retabbing
- [DVB] follow driver splitup in Makefile
