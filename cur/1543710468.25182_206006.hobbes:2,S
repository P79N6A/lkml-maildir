That's ugly as hell.  Actually even more ugly.  It's not that ->release
is such a performance critical path that you absolutely need to avoid one
level of function calls.  So please put a simple wrapper back instead of
the horrible casts and suddenly the silly placement restrictions are gone,
too.
And *please* send any scsi driver changes to linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org.
While we're at it, what's the reason zfcp isn't in drivers/scsi/?
