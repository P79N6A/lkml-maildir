Or it might. It is just too much work for me, because it is takes too long
to do right.
I believe when you manage to save 200K of active L2 cache lines from kernel
use, then a user with a 512K L2 cache will notice it. The hlists are
hopefully good for 20-40K. It would be a beginning at least.

Less jump, but they need more registers on x86, which is IMHO worse (or at 
similarly bad). This one would be probably hard to benchmark for though.
Anyways, hlists are already used all over the kernel (e.g. try grep pprev
net/ipv4/*), just everybody is reinventing the wheel on them all the 
time. I did that myself several times. It would be nicer to use list_*()
macros the time, just without the bloat of the list_* list heads.
To solve your abstraction problems they could be renamed slists, but then
people would confuse them with single linked lists.

I suspect that would either end up with lots of pseudo functional function 
pointer (do_foo(hash_list, void (*foo_functor)(void *, void *)) and other slow
horrors) or a disgusting macro mess like the older lists.h that was
recently removed.
