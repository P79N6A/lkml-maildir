At least the sunserial_console_match() one is an obvious Oops 
(EXPORT_SYMBOL of an __init function).
The comment in the description of
commit 58d784a5c754cd66ecd4791222162504d3c16c74 the warning was bogus    
is bullshit.
I'm not sure whether this might count as a 2.6.24-rc regression or 
whether 2.6.23 is simply differently but similarly broken (does anyone 
actually use the Sun console drivers modular?).
