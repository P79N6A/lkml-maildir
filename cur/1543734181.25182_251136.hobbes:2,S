Hi,
I'm looking for the network packet routing
performance comparison between the latest 2.4
and 2.6 kernel.
I did some initial testing on my mips-based router.
2.6 kernel performed way below 2.4 kernel. It sucks.
Turning on preemption on 2.6 kernel even makes
routing performance worse.
Anybody did a comprehensive study on the routing
performance for 2.6 and 2.4 kernel?
Thanks.
