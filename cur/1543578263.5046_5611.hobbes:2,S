Simple.  Because I stated before that I DON'T even want the networking
to use kiobufs in lower layers.  My whole argument is to pass a kiovec
into the fileop instead of a page, because it makes sense for other
drivers to use multiple pages, and doesn't hurt networking besides
the cost of one kiobuf (116k) and the processor cycles for creating
and destroying it once per sys_sendfile.
