To sum up, why don't you call everything before you reach this point
-pre and then when you decide to write the mail and realise you want
to say no more patches just check in  patch calling it -rc ? you claim
you don't know when to diffrentiate between -pre and -rc, (or maybe
you don't care) well how do you decide to write the above e-mail? I
think that would satisfy nearly everyone and I don't see what would be
so different from your POV, but it is in the end up to you...

There has been a fair bit of bike shedding going on... so I think we
should use some sort of timber and paint it red...
