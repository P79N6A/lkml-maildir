From a user point of view I have to agree with you. Keeping it out of the
kernel makes perfect sense to me.
Easier to test your setup - errors will not hang the box.
In the case the implementation is buggy a daemon can easily be restarted
nightly without disrupting other things running on the box (a nightly
reboot is not as friendly).
From a developer point of view, I also agree.
Debugging kernel code is in general a much harder thing to do than
debugging a userspace daemon. I'd also guess that more people will be
inclined to contribute development time to a userspace program than a
kernel based implementation - just the fact that it's in-kernel will be
percieved as having a much higher barrier-to-entry and I suspect that fact
alone might discourage potential contributers.
