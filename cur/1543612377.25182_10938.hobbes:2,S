Hi there,
I didn't know what to do to fix my problem, so I thought I write to 
you.... So the following is my Problem: ..
Long years ago, I bought every time, Red Hat Linux lalala.. and so on, 
and as I bought Red Hat Linux 7.2 there came the biggest problem I ever 
had, when I compile kernels or oder progs then one time to the other the 
whole computers down, and I get a message like this ....
www.usad.li/robin/fehler1.jpg
  //                            fehler2.jpg
 //                             fehler3.jpg
So I didn't knew what to do, in ircnet I asked some people they told me 
that it could might be a memory problem, so they said I should make a 
memory test with memtest86 ... so I did, but there where no errors, and 
the message came every time again, the very strange thing is that this 
never happend until i setup red hat 7.2
So if you are interested to help me by my problem, It would be graceful 
if you write back, otherwise, I'll spend again a lot of time, to fix 
this problem....
