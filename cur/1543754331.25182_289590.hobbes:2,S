I have been looking at the USB code and talked with gregkh about 
it a bit, it looks to me that in order for this to work its going
to take a self-contained polling driver. I've been busy so I havent
looked too far yet for any pre-existent code that could be utilized.
It may need to be written from scratch, which I also might attempt
once I get my queue a bit reduced.
But as is the code thats there isnt even close to working, its just
a bit of infrastructure.
Cheers,
Jack
