For what it's worth, this kind of measurement widget could be usefully
recast as a pure client of the lttng/systemtap markers that Mathieu is
still working on.  Instead of the custom pc_start/pc_stop functions,
you would have generic markers to identify the start/end spots, and a
bit of callback code to compute/export the statistics to procfs.
