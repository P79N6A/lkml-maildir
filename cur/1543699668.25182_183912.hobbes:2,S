Hi,
I installed 2.6-test10 on one system here some time ago
and had my first crash tonight.
The system was completely frozen and the console in X window
state and didn't respond to SysRq, so I didn't get an OOPS.
But the kernellog shows one irregularity:
Dec 12 16:25:57 dag kernel: drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c: 1080: wakeup_hc
Dec 12 16:25:59 dag kernel: drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c: 1080: suspend_hc
.......
Dec 13 02:01:59 dag kernel: drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c: 1080: suspend_hc
Dec 13 02:01:59 dag kernel: drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c: 1080: wakeup_hc
Dec 13 02:02:02 dag kernel: drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c: 1080: suspend_hc
Dec 13 02:02:02 dag kernel: drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c: 1080: wakeup_hc
(This was obviously the  time of the crash)
It seems to have been looping with about 3 sec intervals.
The system is a 2x500MHz Pentium3, Intel N440BX motherboard
and it was very busy yesterday compiling a lot of software (still was
when it crashed)
There was absolutely NO activity on the USB yesterday.
