Not really. I can find out if you want, but it has to wait until the
middle of next week - I'm out of the office at the moment. If I have
to guess then I point in Mel's direction. =)

I think the problem is what to test. The entire chain of crash dump
tools is in an "interesting" state right now because the code is
pretty easy to break and it is under constant development - the
relocatable kernel code and my and Simon's kexec port for xen are two
good examples. And that the code is spread out over two kernels that
may not be of the same version together with a more or less
unmaintained userspace tool does not help...
I hope that someone else than me booted a crash kernel, but it looks
like noone really tested copying a crash image on x86_64. I didn't
until now. =) It's not that surprising though - there are only a few
kexec/kdump developers out there and there are several architectures
plus focus on features. Bound to break IMO.
Thanks,
