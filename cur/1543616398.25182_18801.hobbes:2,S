Apologies - of course; I meant ls /sbin union {anything moved
out of kernel} gives a maximum range. I could find rationales,
some more questionable than others, for about half the stuff
in /sbin (for instance, if you are mounting NFS over IP, you
/might/ want to have iptables support in there before you start
playing with ip operations which without them might cause
a comprimized root to be mounted - I said /might/).
