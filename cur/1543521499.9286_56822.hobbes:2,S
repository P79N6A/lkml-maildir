I was talking about cmpxchg and cmpxchg8. They doesn't implicitly lock the
bus, but you are going to use them always with the lock prefix :)
andrea@alpha:~/kernel > grep cmpxchg 2.2.14/drivers/usb/*.c
2.2.14/drivers/usb/uhci.c:              asm volatile("lock ; cmpxchg %4,%2 ; sete %0"
2.2.14/drivers/usb/uhci.c:      asm volatile("lock ; cmpxchg %0,%1"
