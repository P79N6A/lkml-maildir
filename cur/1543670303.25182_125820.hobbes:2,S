You are ignoring the main issue of discussion. I don't care if its
ioctl, tcp/ip over carrier pigeon or a pipe.
fwfs is a broken idea because it leaves the data in kernel space. On
a giant IBM monster maybe nobody cares about a few hundred K of cached
firmware in the kernel, but the rest of us happen to run real world
computers.
Catting the firmware to a device node also works fine for me as an 
API, but keep the firmware in userspace.
