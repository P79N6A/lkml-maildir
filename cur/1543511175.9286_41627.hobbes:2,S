Aren't according to what architecture? Some architectures can only
implement these by using a spin lock, thus they will certainly ensure
ordering. My point here is, should we specify these functions to
guarantee ordering, yes or no?
Intuitively I think it makes sense to do so, and I doubt it will be a
performance hit at all, but I am just guessing here.
