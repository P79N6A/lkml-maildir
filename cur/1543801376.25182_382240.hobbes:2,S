Nothing wrong with that.  We could let "off" be another synonym.  Although 
I don't see the need for it, really.

Who are you to say what people really need?  What about people who want to 
test their PCI device and see if it behaves properly in D1 or D2?  How are 
they going to do that if you don't let them put it in that state?
What about people with platform-specific non-PCI devices that have a whole
bunch of different internal power states?  Why force them to use only two
of those states?
The kernel isn't supposed to prevent people from doing perfectly legal
things.  The kernel should provide mechanisms to help people do what they
want.
Besides, as long as the sysfs interface accepts "on" and "suspend" (or 
"off"), what harm does it do to accept the device-specific names as 
well?
