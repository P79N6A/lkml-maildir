Oops, my fault. Of course, I tested the patch, but kernel modules are disabled in my test setup, so I missed the error. Thanks for pointing that out, Zach.
Enclosed to this message is a new patch, which replaces the goto-loop by the while-based one, but leaves the EXPORT_SYMBOL macro intact.
And yes, I agree that for this routine, the break statement looks more appropriate than return.
