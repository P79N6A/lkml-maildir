I have a very similar problem.  I am running test10-pre5 (x86).  I can accept
uploaded FTP all day long, but when downloading from me, my network dies in
very short order.  This was a windows box that was killing me (both ME and
2000).  These are about 100 2-4 meg files that I'm talking about.  I didn't
see any significant log entries, but there was one oddity.  There were 4
incorrect FTP login attempts recorded when I actually logged in successfully
the first time.
I bring the network down (ifconfig eth0 down), kill dhclient then bring it
back up and restart dhclient.  That seems to work, but it's a pain in the
butt.
