Works fine on all systems I have ever tried it on (so that would be various 
Matrox AGP cards and one or more of random SiS PCI card, random Trident 
ISA, random Diamond Stealth - I've been changing cards a lot in my server 
box and in my development box and am not sure on which I have used it and 
on which not...). This would be all on 2.4.x kernels by the way, haven't 
needed to use it recently.
