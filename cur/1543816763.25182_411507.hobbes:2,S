Its true that futex code implies lot of context switches (kernel side but also 
user side).
Even if you change kernel behavior in futex_wake(), you wont change the fact 
that a typical pthread_cond_signal does :
1) lock cond var
lll_lock(cv->lock);
2) wake one waiter if necessary
FUTEX_WAKE(cv->wakeup_seq, 1);
3) unlock cond var
If a waiter process B has higher priority than the wake process A, then most 
probably, B is scheduled before A had a chance to unlock cond var (step 3))
So B will re-enter kernel (because of the contended cond var lock), and A will 
re-enter kernel too to futex_wake() process A again, but on cond var lock this 
time, not on condvar wakeup_seq futex.
Each time a thread enters futex kernel code, an expensive find_extend_vma() 
lookup is done, (expensive because of the read_lock but also the possible 
amount of vm_area_struct in mm_struct)
I wish futex code had a special implementation for PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS 
futexes , where no vma lookups would be necessary at all. Most mutexes or 
condvar have a process private scope (not shared by different processes)
