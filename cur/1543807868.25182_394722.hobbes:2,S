There's a bug in inputattach. The SERIO_RS232 constant is completely
mucking the bits that specify the protocol.

APPENDIX A
You probably know this better than I do, but the .type above is
misnamed. It should really be .proto. It's impossible, as far as I can
tell, to specify the type (like SERIO_RS232) with a SPIOCSTYPE call.
