Oh, good. I was already going to put my head under sand. :-)
I'm not so expert about the kernel. I've just read [ORLL]
and some bits of the kernel sources.
So, error in the codes are not so strange.
But, it's better now that you know we are talking about version 2.2...
I'm glad to hear that locking are ok.

I guess futex are some kind of semaphore flavour under linux 2.4/2.6.
However, you need to use SYS V shared memory in any case.
Tests for SYS V shared memory are included in the web page
(even though using SYS V semaphores).
I don't think, reading the numbers, that managing pagetables "is very
inefficient".
I think very inefficient are SYS V semaphore orethe double-copying channel
you call a pipe.

As I say in the web page,
 having all the pages locked in memory is not a necessary condition
for the applicability of communication mechanisms based on capabilities.
Simply, it make it easier to write the code and does not make me crazy
with the Linux swapping system.
Bye bye,
