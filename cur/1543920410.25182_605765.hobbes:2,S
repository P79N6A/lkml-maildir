Hi All,
Work and personal issues prevented me in being faster in sending out this e-mail.
Sorry for that.
Concerning the watchdog device drivers: this is what is still out to be merged:
1) Move the watchdog device drivers from drivers/char/watchdog to drivers/watchdog.
(Unless someone objects). We do this to make it conform with the other type of
drivers (like hwmon, i2c, parport, ...)
2) The Uniform watchdog device driver is in the -mm tree since +-19 August. I still
need to ask a number of people to review the code before I want to release it.
I also need to document it properly before it get's released.
3) iTCO_wdt.c -> add additional ICH8 PCI-ID's, clean-up pci-device-id-table, ...
4) change naming of IPC SBC Watchdog Timer Driver (used to be wafer but the driver
runs on several IPC boards).
5) AR7 Watchdog Timer
6) Improvements on Documentation/watchdog/src/watchdog-simple.c.
7) Watchdog driver for the Atmel AT91SAM9xx range of processors (After review).
8) SBC Nano 7240 Watchdog Timer (After review).
If someone has objections or when I missed something: please let me know.
Thanks,
Wim.
(Note: for people that want to look at the Uniform Watchdog Device Driver: please see
the code in the linux-2.6-watchdog-mm git tree at:
