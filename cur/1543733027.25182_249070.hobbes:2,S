It's still useful, it just is built into the drivers as a library rather
than the kernel, and the actual "core" is just a major number sharing
scheme, again the only advantage of building the library functions into
the kernel or as a separate module are a small memory saving on a rare use
case, hardly an astounding reason,
New functions added to the library can be made available to new drivers,
and vendors can ship their own set of library sources and not use
the kernels ones..
