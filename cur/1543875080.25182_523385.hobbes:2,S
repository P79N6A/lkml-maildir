+There are two kinds of unregistration functions. unregister_*probe()
+functions are useful to unregister a few probes. However, it will take
+several seconds to remove all probes when you unregister hundreds of

+fast to remove hundreds of probes. unregister_*probe_fast() function

 The next three subsections explain how the different types of
