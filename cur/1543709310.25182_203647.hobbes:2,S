Depends on your fs, some fs's will allow you to create much larger
files that others:
cw@pain:~$ truncate -c -s100t big-file
cw@pain:~$ ls -lh big-file
-rw-r--r--    1 cw       cw           100T Mar  3 02:05 big-file
Note, you might need a 64-bit system to be able to write to all of
that because the index into the buffer-cache is an unsigned long.  For
me on my notebook I can't write past 8T.
