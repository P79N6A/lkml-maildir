[PATCH] Remove PageCompound() checks before calling set_page_dirty()
Pre commit 41d78ba55037468e6c86c53e3076d1a74841de39 it was illegal
to call set_page_dirty() on a compound page, since it stored the
destructor in the mapping field. But now it's ok, so remove the
ugly PageCompound() checks from bio and direct-io.
