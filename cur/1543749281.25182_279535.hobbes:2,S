But we didn't resolve anything with respect to multiple PCI domains,
did we?  As far as I can see, /proc/bus/pci currently doesn't support
multiple domains at all.  I don't like the idea of adding new stuff
that we already know is insufficient for machines in the very near
future.  True, it's just extending an existing interface, but it
seems like if we're going to the trouble of changing X, we might as
well address multiple domains at the same time.
