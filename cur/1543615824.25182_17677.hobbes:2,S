For archs that need ->zone, merging it with ->flags sounds like a
great idea. Id like to cram something into ->flags on 64 bit archs
since its only a long due to bitop constraints. I had thought of
stuffing ->count in the high word but now Im just getting silly
since all non atomic accesses to ->flags would then have to be word
ones.

Id like to do redo some profiling, on ppc64 we had page_address() doing
pointer arithmetic (instead of page->virtual) and the compiler created
an awful sequence of instructions in the acenic interrupt handler.
A zero copy TCP benchmark made it rather obvious.
