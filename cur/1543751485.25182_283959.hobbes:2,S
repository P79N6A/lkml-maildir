Actually there are three thing, which I want to verify
	1. It has support for Hotplug of FC-HBA on PCI Express
	2. DISK(mainly iSCSI) addition to FC-SAN 
	3. PnP of Disk(mainly iSCSI) recognition by iSCSI Target(Including
FC side and iSCSI side)
And what is the information flow, how it works and what document and driver
code I should study.

Thanks and Best Regards
