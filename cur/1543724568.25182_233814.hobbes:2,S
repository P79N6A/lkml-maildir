Yes. 
There's more information about why this is needed in the commit message,
but it basically boils down to an optimization in the system call path
where the save-register-area is used _directly_ as the system call
argument frame on the stack. It's a very worthwhile optimization, since it 
works very well in 99% of all cases and it makes a very hot path faster, 
but gcc thinking that the callee owns the arguments has bitten us before, 
and there is no way to tell gcc that it is wrong.
Personally, I think that if you wanted the callee to own the arguments, 
you should use the "stdcall" attribute, which _literally_ is all about the 
callee owning the stack (and can often generate better code for _other_ 
reasons than tail-calls), but lacking that, I'd have preferred some other 
explicit way to tell gcc about the special "asmlinkage" rules.
No such way exists, so I just fooled gcc by hand. Ugly.
