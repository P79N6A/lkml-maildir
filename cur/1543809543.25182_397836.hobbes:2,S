>From time to time, I've been experiencing timeouts with my SATA disk (a
Seagate ST3300831AS) attached to a VIA VT6420 controller on a VIA
K8T800-based MSI motherboard. This has happened somewhat rarely on a
variety of Fedora kernel versions.
Basically, sometimes IO will get really slow and I'll start getting
"ata1: command 0x35 timeout, stat 0x50 host_stat 0x4" in my logs, with
the occasional "ata1: command 0x25 timeout, stat 0x50 host_stat 0x4" and
"ata1: command 0xb0 timeout, stat 0x50 host_stat 0x0" thrown in for good
measure.
The disk (and/or controller) isn't unresponsive -- I can do a smartctl
-a -d ata /dev/sda and it'll complete (eventually), and IO to the disk
continues (very slowly), but it's generally unusable until the next
reboot.
Any help would be appreciated.
	Thanks, Nicholas.
