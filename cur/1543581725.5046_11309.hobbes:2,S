Correct.  The current recursive makefile design means it is difficult
to get a definitive list of modules without excessive overhead.  So
modules_install assumes that you have compiled the modules already and
lets the 'cp' command fail.  The 2.5 Makefile redesign will get this
right.

Broken 2.4 makefile design.

The 2.5 makefile redesign will kill this problem once and for all.
