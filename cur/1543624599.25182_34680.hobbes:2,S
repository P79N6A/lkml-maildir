I have experimented with using NFS for that -- start a local daemon that
exports a virtual filesystem and mount that. The great bonus is that it's
platform independent -- it works on Solaris, HP-UX and even Ultrix just as
well. Other projects have become more important, however, and I haven't
finished it. If you're interested, drop me a line.
