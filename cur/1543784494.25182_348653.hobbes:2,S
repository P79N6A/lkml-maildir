After switching from 2.6.13-rc7 to 2.6.13 I've started to have corrupted
data written on my hard disks, there was appearing blocks of 0x00 bytes
in between the data. I've tracked when this started to happen in the git
patches and I've found that this bug is due to the changes done in the
file drivers/pci/setup-res.c of 2.6.13-rc7-git2 patch. Now I run a 2.6.13
kernel with that file unmodified and everything is ok.
