I just tested it on a UP P4 HT machine.  I wouldn't expect much
difference here, bigger machines should show more (I'll try to get
things to work on my 4p machine).  Volano performance increased by a bit
(~1%) but this is close to the error range.
Before: about 15479 messages per second
Now:    about 15615 messages per second
The glibc test suite still passes so the code should be fine.
