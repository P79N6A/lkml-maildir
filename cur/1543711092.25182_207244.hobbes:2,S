I was able to reproduce this with the scsi_debug driver (you can use it 
for simple tape tests by changing TYPE_DISK to TYPE_TAPE). Reverting the 
patch:
# ChangeSet
#   2004/03/12 16:22:36-08:00 greg@kroah.com 
#   remove cdev_set_name completely as it is not needed.
(and editing drivers/char/tty_io.c to get the kernel to compile) solved 
the problem for me. st.c is using the name put into kobj.name in making 
the class file names. I will make a patch that removes this dependency.
While looking at this problem, I noticed that the naming changes already 
committed to BK had disappeared. Looking at st.c history revealed that the 
following change had been committed (sorry for wrapping) by greg@kroah.com 
46 hours ago:

The change comment was "merge" and it resulted in st.c version 1.81. (I am 
not using Bitkeeper but trying to extract information from bkbits.net.)
