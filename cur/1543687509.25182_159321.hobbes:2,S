If someone is marked for resched, it means we want to give someone else the 
cpu right?  In this case at least, re-selecting blender is not the right 
thing to do.  Looks like he's burning rubber... going nowhere fast.

Hmm.  In what way did it hurt interactivity?  I know that if you pass the 
cpu off to non-gui task who's going to use his full 100 ms slice, you'll 
definitely feel it.  (made workaround, will spare delicate tummies;)  If 
you mean that, say X releases the cpu and has only a couple of ms left on 
it's slice and is alone in it's queue, that preempting it at the end of 
it's slice after having only had the cpu for such a short time after wakeup 
hurts, you can qualify the preempt decision with a cpu possession time check.

Yeah.  I crossbred it with a ~deadline scheduler, and created a mutt.
