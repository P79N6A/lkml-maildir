Hi,
Has anyone succeeded to use said SCSI card (it was shipped with an HP DeskJet
and has an NCR 53c400a chip and one jumper(?)/connector with 3 pins and no
onboard description for it) with Linux-2.2.x? I tried almost anything (except
the right thing [tm]) to get this thing to work using the g_NCR5380 driver.
The driver disk for Windows reveals (after reading some .ini's) the the card
can be configured for ports(hex) 280, 290, 300, 310, 330, 340(?), 348, 350 and
interrupts 3,4,5,7,9 but I'm not sure if this veast uses ISA-PNP or how else
it knows about which port/irq to use (I tried option ncr_53c400a=1 and all
mentioned base addresses and all irq's (for ...; do is a good thing :-), but
all I got was (least bad) "init_module: Device or resource busy" or (worst) an
OOPS with an instant lockup (not nice, since it left an uninitialized SCSI
module which rendered Magic SysRq useless).
I failed, so I ask :-)
It would be great if someone could give me a clue.
TIA,
Nils
