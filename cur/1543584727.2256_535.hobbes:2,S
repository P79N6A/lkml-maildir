While compiling the vmnet module, there is a warning
make: Entering directory `/tmp/vmware-config2/vmnet-only'
bridge.c: In function `VNetBridgeReceiveFromDev':
bridge.c:788: warning: implicit declaration of function `skb_datarefp'
and while inserting the module
/tmp/vmware-config2/vmnet.o: unresolved symbol skb_datarefp
I have traced this back to 2.4.2-ac4 by looking for where this function 
was removed.
yes, technically this probably is OT, and properly belong on the VMware 
list, but I can't access their nntp server.
basically, why was this function removed, what did it do, what can be 
done to make VMware run again?
