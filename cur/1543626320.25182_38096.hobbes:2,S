Hi,
First of all, which kernel are you using?
I believe I already fixed this bug in CVS but I haven't
received any confirmation. Can you give it a try?
You can get the CVS repository at:
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=44773
Then edit the config file and point it to your kernel source,
make, make install. That should be it.
Otherwise (when I get your kernel version) I can send you a
patch to try out.
