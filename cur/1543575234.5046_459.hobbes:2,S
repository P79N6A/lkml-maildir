> It doesnt even apply
sorry Alan, I think it's because I had to copy/paste
it
with my mouse under X into my browser (I don't have
smtp access here at work), and it applies here with a
-12 lines offset...
Here it is attached for 2.2.18pre25, but since the
raid
server is running now (under 2.2.18pre20+patch), I
won't be able to test it till next week, but
I'm a bit confident since it will do the same as the
one which currently allows this server to boot.
as soon as I can reboot it, I promise I will test the
kernel with and without the patch to be really sure.
but before that, if people who have problems with
megaraid/netraid could give it a try, that would be
cool. Also, it would be nice if people for which the
normal megaraid driver works would accept to check
this
doesn't break anything.
Regards,
Willy
