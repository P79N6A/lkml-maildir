Great, so this definitely is some kind of timing issue, thanks for 
verifying that.

Yes, could be some scheduler update that made the problem more visible. If 
you'd had time to use git-bisect to find the exact commit that exposes 
your problem, that might be interesting. But as you said that this is not 
immediately reproducible, it might take ages.

Yes, that would help. Especially knowing whether running with 'nohpet' 
fixes the problem would be nice.
