I see.  I also tried to put Ingo's latest RT patch on top of that, it 
went in except for the Makefile, wrong src version, but then the 
Makefile itself was broken with some mumbling about make 
modules_install failing because ln claimed the last argument was 
bogus. I couldn't see anything wrong with the version names I used, 
they were indentical in both the Makefile and in my 'makeit' script.
Running git2, seems to be happy so far (about 20 minutes)
Anything in particular that I should be watching for?
