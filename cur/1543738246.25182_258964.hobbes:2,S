I think that removing aligns completly will be very bad. I am Gentoo user 
and I set my user space CFLAGS for all system to -falign-loops 
-fno-align-<everything else>. I did not tested it in depth, but my simple 
tests show that unaligning loops is a very bad idea. Unaligning functions 
is safer since small and fast functions should be always inlined.
