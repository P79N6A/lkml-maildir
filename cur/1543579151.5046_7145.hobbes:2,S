I can be a little more specific on this point. Netscape with
kernel 2.4.0 _does_ connect/download at a few local (New Zealand)
web sites (maybe 10% of those I've tried). I can't download
from _any_ distant site. It doesn't die, it just doesn't function
properly.
Several people have suggested I remove ECN from the kernel, or
disable it. Well, ECN has never been selected as a config option
in the kernel, so this is not the source of the problem....
Thanks for your suggestion,
Roger Young.

Just a data point - Netscape 4.76 is working wonderfully
for me on several 2.4.x systems - well, netscape does die
fairly often with bus errors, but when it's running it runs well -
