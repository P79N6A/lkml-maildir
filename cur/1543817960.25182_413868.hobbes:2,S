just to explain it to everyone: the code Thomas refers to and which we 
are working on is John's GTOD patchset with Thomas' high-resolution 
timers patches ontop of it. [all of that (and more) is glued together in 
the -rt tree as well].
Thomas' hrtimers queue (ontop of 2.6.16) is a practical, working 
implementation of the clock-event design Thomas is talking about, 
resulting in a working high-resolution timers solution that spans all 
the relevant Linux APIs: nanosleep() and POSIX timers. So Thomas' 
arguments derive straight from that experience.
for more details, the latest hrtimers code can be found at:
  
http://tglx.de/projects/hrtimers
the merge of the hrtimers subsystem into 2.6.16 was just the first step, 
and the next steps are expressed in the patches above.
