I ended up having to do that. :-/

They won't apply in the order as listed in the -mm3 series file. :(

I'm running 2.6.3-mm3-486-fazok (nick's patch), and it has improved my 
slab usage greatly.  It was averaging 500MB-700MB slab.  Now slab is 
~230MB, and page cache is ~700MB
See:
http://www.matchmail.com/stats/lrrd/matchmail.com/srv-lnx2600.matchmail.com-memory.html
Is there any way I can get the VM patches against 2.6.3?  I'm not 
comfortable with running -mm3 on this production server, especially 
seeing the "sync hang" bug.
Thanks,
Mike
