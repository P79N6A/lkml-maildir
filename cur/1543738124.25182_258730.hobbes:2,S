The reason is that you haven't just admitted very clearly that 
"Linux select isn't Posix compliant and it was a design decision 
not to do so for performance reasons". I think this kind of 
authorative answer would shut up many people. :-)

Unfortunately this isn't the best argument..
I think most people just hope Linux would follow the standard.
The old Linux threads weren't posix-compliant either for years,
and people still fixed (most of?) it in 2.6. By your argument
that would not have happened.
