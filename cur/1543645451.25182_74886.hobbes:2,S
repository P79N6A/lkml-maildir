Great :-/  Now that you have restored the "rq->wrq" aka working copy of
the request which in its past life under PIO only updated to block when
the entire request was completed.  So there are no partial completions
possible given the old method in the legacy path.
One of the issues Linus kick my can over was the "requirement" of partial
completeions.  What I need rom block is a way to know how much is
completed of the original total request.  So whatever value is the
original rq->nr_sectors assigned to "TF.2/HF.2" or nsector_offset(s),
needs to be carried in block and updated to reflect how much more is
remaining of this CDB task.
I do not care if you call it "rq->dumbass_accounting_for_andre", but
provide this dummy accounting variable in "struct request" and I will be
happy.  This has nothing to do with bio or bh segments from the kernel.
It is everything about device side accounting carried by block; whereas,
the ll_driver can use it to determine what or if there is to be another
interrupt.
Why are we getting lost interrupts?
Because there is a beautiful "data-block completion" v/s "immediate
interrupt assertion" race between the device and the kernel.  So please
provide a counter which can be used to determine where the interrupt
driven partial completion model the driver is wrt the device/request.
Jens, not asking for much.
Otherwise the ADMA/VDMA is not doable period.
