i think i agree with you.
- we have 'top half' contexts, which are also called 'hardirqs'.
- then we have 'bottom half' contexts, which are also called 'softirqs'.
the fact that 'bottom halves' used to be an earlier concept that had a
slightly different meaning from 'softirqs' for a limited amount of time
does not remove from the meaningfulness of the naming itself. Today
'bottom halves' and 'softirqs' are the same thing.
