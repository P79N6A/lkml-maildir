The topology function in generic may just do nothing
if not defined by the arch like pcibus_to_node. If the arch does not
define it return indeterminate and make all node specific allocations fall
back to unspecific allocation. This works for all arches and preserves
the existing behavior.

Its best to have the kernel setup in such a way that functions can be 
added without having to cause breakage.
It is imaginable that someone will add more hardware something to node
functions in the near future given that pcibus_to_node is just for pci.
