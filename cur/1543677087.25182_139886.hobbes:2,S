We usually have an 8259 but its wired up to the main interrupt
controller. Even if we statically allocated 0-15, we still need a higher
irq for that cascade.
Going all the way and removing NR_IRQS also catches problems like the
random driver where we would only add randomness on 8259 (ie < 16)
interrupts with a mixed static/dynamic scheme.
