I tried your patch last night but the leak is still reported. I need
to investigate further and put some printk's in the piix_host_stop
function to check whether the freeing really takes place.
What I can't follow is where the ata_port_info.private_data
(port_info[] or ppinfo[]) in piix_init_one gets transfered to
ata_host.private_data (the "host" argument) that piix_host_stop tries
to free.
