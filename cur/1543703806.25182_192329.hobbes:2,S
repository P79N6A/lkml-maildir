OK, that makes sense.
BTW, I think SN2 has a brain-dead definition of node_memblk[]. It currently works 
but I think it is incorrect & should probably be fixed before we get into
trouble. 
On SN2, memory blocks that ACTUAL EXIST are described via the EFI tables. 
This EFI table describes memory that is put into the VM tables.
The SRAT tables that are used to build the node_memblks array dont describe
actual memory.  The SRAT (on SN2) describes the way hardware could potentially map 
physical memory to nodes. A memblk entry will cover non-existant memory.
For example.  For one node with max memory (assume 512MB dimms)
	- each node has 4 discontiguous blocks of memory.
	- actual memory on node exists at these node offsets:
	 	0-2GB
		16-18GB
		32-24GB
		48-50GB
	- These ranges are described by the EFI tables
	- the SRAT (& node_memblk) has a SINGLE entry to describe the entire node:
		memblk = 0-64GB 
	  Note that this entry covers non-existent memory
I believe SN2 should use 4 SRAT entries - one entry for each block of memory
that actually exists.
