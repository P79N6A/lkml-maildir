There is.
Try passing scsi_mod.default_dev_flags=0x40000
The SUSE initrd will also understand the better memorizable version
scsi_noreportlun=1.
Devices known to be broken should be added to the blacklist with
BLIST_NOREPORTLUN.

Looks like random garbage.

This probably uses some of the less common LUN numbering?
REPORT_LUNS reports 8byte LUN numbers, which are flattened according
to the most commonly used scheme to a 32bit unsigned int by Linux.
We might change that the LUNs to be opaque or detect the LUN encoding
before flattening.

Garbage.

LUN flattening issue?

Ask them to fix it.
