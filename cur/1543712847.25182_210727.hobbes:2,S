I suspect you may just be able to get away with this for serial drivers
using serial_core.  However, I suspect it'll break non-serial_core using
serial drivers.
The serial drivers track the tty count themselves, so that they know
when to do the final close processing (why you may ask - because of
the blocking for DCD in the open code.)  I wouldn't like to say what
would happen if ->open were called for a different tty structure for
the same port while ->close was in progress.
