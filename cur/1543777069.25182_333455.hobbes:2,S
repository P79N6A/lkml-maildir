Sorry but real life examples shows that store chunk of 
data in agregator is less expensive than context switch neccessary for 
store data or time neccasy for send and handle signal from buffer like 
"I'm full! let me out of here ..".

OK .. "so you can say better is stop flushing buffers on measure which 
wil take day or more" ? :_)
Some DTrace probes/technik are specialy prepared for long or evel very 
long time experiment wich will only prodyce few lines results on end of 
experiment.
Look at DTrace documentation for speculative tracing:
http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-6223/6mlkidli7?a=view
Some experiments do not have deterinistic time and must be finished after 
i. e. "occasional failing". What if it will take so long so you will fill 
all avalaible storage in relayfs way ?
OK, never mind .. you have discontinued storage. Using kind speculative 
tracing way I'll have result *just after* "occasional failing" and you 
will start parse data stored using relayfs.
