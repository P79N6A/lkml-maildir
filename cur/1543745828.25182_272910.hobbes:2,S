Hello!
I am wondering, whether support for the ide atapi (raid/normal)
controllers will be merged into 2.6?
ITE offers GPLed source code from their website, so their should be no
problem imho.
Another question: Why are the IDE Raids listed below
SCSI support in menuconfig? Doesn't it make sense to
open a new point 'IDE Raid Controller' or add them to
the general ide section?
And why are ide raid controllers using scsi namespace /dev/sd*?
I am a bit confused about that.
Thanks for any information,
Nico
