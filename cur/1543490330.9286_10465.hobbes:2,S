FWIW, nfs/write.c contains this code:
        /*
         * Ok, there's another user of this page with the new request..
         * The IO completion will then free the page and the dentry.
         */
        atomic_inc(&page->count);
        file->f_count++;
Now if the problem is with f_count and it's on an SMP only, could it
be that that's the problem up there?
If page->count requires an atomic update in this particular situation,
wouldn't f_count also require an atomic update?
Or is f_count guaranteed to be accessed only be one processor?
I'm just guessing here, of course.
