Seems that the V4L/DVB patches in question are safe in this regard.
These patches add PCI table entries matching the specific subsystem ids;
without these entries the device will still match the default entry for
the chip, and the user will get the same /dev/videoN, but most likely it
won't work correctly.
The only problem which might arise is with additional IR input devices,
but no one should expect any stable ordering there - with USB the order
of input devices is already random.
