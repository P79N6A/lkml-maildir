Really?  If I'm making use it, maybe visiting a few hundred pages a
day, and opening 20 tabs, I find I have to kill it every few days, to
reclaim the memory it's hogging, when its resident size exceeds my RAM
size and it starts chugging.

100kB per program, even for 100 programs, is nothing compared a
browser's 300MB footprint.  Now, some of that 300MB is permanently
swapped out for the first few days of running.  Libraries and such.
Which is relevant to this thread: swap is useful, just so you can swap
out completely unused parts of programs.  (The parts which could be
optimised away in principle).
