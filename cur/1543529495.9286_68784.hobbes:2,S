Subject: 2.3.51: module bttv refcount never decreases

Hello,
In kernel 2.3.51 (and 2.3.50 too), when running and then stopping a
process that uses /dev/video, the bttv module is left in a state with a
positive refcount. fuser /dev/video shows that noone is using that device
anymore.
(I don't know if this matters, but I have devfs compiled in but disabled.)
Met vriendelijke groet,
Guus Sliepen.
