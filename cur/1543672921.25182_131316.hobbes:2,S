Well, since time was short I didn't want to hack the kernel. What I ended up
doing was setting up an itimer for 10ms intervals and then measuring how much
longer than 10ms I was asleep for.  While this only collects samples at 100Hz,
it will work with the default kernel.
Thanks for the suggestions,
Chris
