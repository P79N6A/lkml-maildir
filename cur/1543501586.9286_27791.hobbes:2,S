Hi folks,
I worked very hard the last week to finish my kernel scheduling latencies
benchmarks, the results are very interesting (sometime very
disappointing,sometime pretty good) , take a look please.
I think the results gave us the proof that modern hardware is capable of
low-latency apps , like realtime auido apps.
Please take 5min of your time and go to my homepage:
http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/audio
Here you will find detailed scheduling latency analysis during high system load
plus you can download the benchmark  ( latencytest-0.4.tar.gz )
to do your own benchmarking.
Can someone please test the benchmark on kernel 2.3.9 and 2.2.10 to see if
there are some differencies, and send me please the results so I will post
these on my page.
I'm interested in results on SCSI disks too.
I will update my audio page everytime there are some advances in this area on
the linux kernel.
In future I will enhance the benchmark to test other subsystems than audio,
(for example usleep() is very sensitive to heavy disk I/O ( up to 100ms
latency))
comments, suggestions, ideas ?
regards,
Benno.
