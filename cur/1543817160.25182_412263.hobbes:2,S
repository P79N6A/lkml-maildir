I have heard from friends that this is due to how readahead works. It 
reads beyond the end of the track, and logically, the hardware signals an 
error (leading to missing bytes at the end). It is said to be solved using 
the -pad option when writing CDs.
^^ I could not reproduce this oddness on my own, though.
Just a hint, maybe.
