    Hi Karel :)

    If you want to have configurable installation directories and
configurable settings for building but with the pain of autotools, you
can give "mobs" a try if you want. You will find in my homepage (see my
signature below). If you find it so much big and/or you think you will
be changing a pain for another pain, I can help porting.
    Anyway, if you don't like mobs or you just don't want to try it,
that's fine, but please don't use autotools, it doesn't make much sense
for a linux only project, since you will be using only the "directory
choosing" part of autotools. Maybe a hand made script will help (and I
can help with that, too) if you just want to have selectable directories
and CFLAGS support...
    And thanks for util-linux-ng, I was waiting for them :))
