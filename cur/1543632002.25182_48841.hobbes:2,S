It's pretty odd that this happens to the buddy lists. I guess if it's
needed as a stopgap measure, I can't complain too much, but I'd suspect
something's corrupting it or you're catching a buddy list operation in
progress. I might be interested in taking a stab at finding out where
the corruption happens if you also think that's what's going on.
Cheers,
Bill
