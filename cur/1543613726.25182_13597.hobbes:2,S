FWIW, I have an ES1371 based sound card, and mpg123 drives it at 172 
interrupts/sec (calculated in procinfo). But that _is_ only when playing. And 
(my slightly hacked) timidity drives my card w/ only 23(@48kHz sample rate; 
21 @ 44.1kHz) interrupts/sec
Is this 172 figure right? (Not through esd either. i almost always turn it 
off, and sp recompiled mpg123 to use the std OSS driver)
