But for the case we're looking at, you've already said that you don't
care much about actually controlling CPU, just monitoring it. So what
does it matter if the CPU sharing isn't perfectly accurate? I don't
think that you're painting a realistic scenario.

In that case we should take the existing cpu_acct code out of 2.6.24
until the API has been made more useful and reusable, so that we don't
have to support it for ever.
