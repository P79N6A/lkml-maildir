In kernels 2.3.13-pre8 and 2.3.13 (possibly earlier) a bug was introduced
in the Buslogic.c module. The variable PCI_Device->resource[0] is 1 less
than it should be, and thus the check of (BaseAddress0 &
PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_SPACE) fails. I've worked around it by adding 1 to the
variable PCI_Device->resource[0], but that is not the best way.
