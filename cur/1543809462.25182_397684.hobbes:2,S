"kill all"?  That is so completely different from the intended behavior.
 Robust mutexes are no concept which has been invented here.  It is
clearly specified.  The reaction to a terminating thread/process is
notification of other interested parties.
None of your proposals makes any sense in this context.

Nothing which relies on the syscalls goes into cvs unless the kernel
side is first committed.  I never do this.  What is in cvs now is an
implementation of the intra-thread robust mutexes based on the same
mechanisms.  I.e., using the new syscall is a trivial thing since the
infrastructure is already in place.  And the method is proven to work.

The list being corrupted means that the mutexes are corrupted.  In which
case the application would crash anyway.
As for the "endless loop".  You didn't read the code, it seems.  There
are two mechanisms to prevent this: the list is destroyed when the
individual elements are handled and there is an upper limit on the
number of robust mutexes which can be registered.  The limit is
ridiculously high so it'll no problem for correct programs and it also
will eliminate run-away list following code.
