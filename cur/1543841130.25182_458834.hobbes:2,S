We need some method to get access to the class_to_string array (defined
inside avc.c) from hooks.c  In my core changes this is needed to be able
to translate the numeric tclass into a human readable string in the new
warning message in hooks.c  I agree this would be needless if the only
user of avc_class_to_string was avc_dump_query but the whole point of
adding this new accessor was the new inode_update_sclass user in
hooks.c.
Were you suggesting that rather than use an accessor function I instead
make the array extern and use it directly?  I don't forsee this array
syntax changing any time in the future but I'd still rather have some
logical interface that is most likely just going to get compiled out.
This way if things do change we don't have to hunt down all the direct
users of the array across different code.
