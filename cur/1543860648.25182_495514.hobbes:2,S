Adding that functionality hasn't gotten easier at all since
we use the flattened tree for everything, heh.

There should be a well-defined "C-style" interface, yes.  But it
does _not_ have to be a copy of the data and it does _not_ have
to be the same interface.
You also can't require "i386" to add that stuff right now, when
they only have one user (the fs code) that is perfectly happy
calling the low-level interface for the three or four calls it
needs.

Yeah, and that's a great thing.  Any "unified" interface we
come up with should support both those "flat trees", and
"real OF trees", but also "real, still alive during kernel
run-time, OF".

Yes.  A problem that can easily be solved by a little cache
thing (for the device nodes, not even the property data) if
it turns out to be a real advantage.

Not single thread -- but a "global OF lock" yes.  Not that
it matters too much, (almost) all property accesses are init
time anyway (which is effectively single threaded).

But since you have a _put() function anyway, for your reference
counting, having magic (automatically allocated, not static of
course) buffers works just fine.

Or simply using a 32-bit client interface, yes.  You can sidestep that
issue by not having OF around at all anymore by the time the kernel
proper starts, but that's not a good argument for not running with OF
still alive.

Yes, the interfaces should be consolidated (at least as far as it
makes sense, and people can reach agreement) -- let's get there step
by step please, don't say "you can't do an OF interface in the kernel
since it's not identical to ours and you didn't do all the necessary
work to merge and fix everything up front" :-)
So let's decide on the text-vs.-binary fs thing first...
