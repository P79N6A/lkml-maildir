I have attached a tcpdump, but it's not a sophisticated one, it's produced by 
'tcpdump host thames and host spider1', 'thames' being the RH 6.0 server and 
'spider1' the Shiva Terminal Server.... I've looked at it but not being a 
TCP/IP expert (yet :^)) can't see much.... I guess you would like something 
more specfic and/or detailed, please let me know what and I'll happily do it...
> 1.	The spiderports don't handle SACK and are confused by the offers
I Tried disabling SACK by 'echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_sack', seemed to 
make no difference... I say 'seemed' because I was remote to the site and the 
way I tested was to have a guy on site sit there on a terminal doing his stuff, 
and tell me what it felt like, his feedback was 'vague' shall we say (well it 
seems faster but I'm sure it's not, oh yes, maybe it isn't now etc. etc 
wibbble, wibble....) Also, I'm not sure whether changing this is dynamic i.e. 
should the above have an imediate effect, or is it necessary to establish a 
connection after the mod, or (surely not) reboot.... I tried getting the guy to 
relogin after each change and note the differences, still too vague to be of 
much use
Tried a variety of other stuff too, including disabling tcp_timestamps, did it 
in the usual methodical fashion, one change at a time, see what's different, 
but nothing seemed to be the magic bullet. Tempering all this is the lack of 
useful feedback obtained from Mr Vague...

Flicking through the tcpdump, this looks to me like it's possible, but then 
again, I know nothing and I'm about to sit down with a nice cup of tea, a 
printout of the tcpdump man page, and see if I can learn something...

In order to circumvent vagueness, I'll be at one of the ofending sites Mon, 
Tue, Wed and will hopefully be able to be more objective about results then
