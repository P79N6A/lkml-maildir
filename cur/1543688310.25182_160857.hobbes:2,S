   Rather an initrd under Linux.  Note that there is a partial source 
driver, and RH driver's disks here: (look under raid IC with the right 
chipset for partial source.)

   If you are doing raid 1.  Lilo should work.  It doesn't really matter 
if lilo isn't aware of of the data on the other drive.  Each has a full 
copy of everything.
PS-  Newer linux kernels should be able to support the "raid" controller 
as a normal ide controller.  You could then just configure linux 
software raid.
