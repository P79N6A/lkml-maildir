Hi Jeff and others,
On the topic of Silicon Image SATA support, how do things look for
supporting the SiI 3512?  This chip seems to be pretty common on
Nforce3 boards.
I had a look on the SiI web site and they say the programming
interface is very close to the 3112.  Unfortunately their data sheets
don't seem to be freely available so I can't tell how close the
interface really is (or do the work to add 3512 support myself).
Thanks,
  Roland
