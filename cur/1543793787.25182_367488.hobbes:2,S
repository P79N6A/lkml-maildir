I would like to contribute that listing with two non-technical reasons
more:
 * Encourages good code. Due to the 4 Kb stacks patch several parts of
	the kernel have gone on diet, improving the quality of the code
	(see ndiswrapper, ndis drivers can overflow the stack even with
	8KB stacks, the 4KB patch will force them to develop a _real_
	safe solution for that, improving the quality of ndiswrapper).
 * Some distros are enabling 4KB (fedora), other distros aren't, so
	having a single stack size option will make 3rd party modules
	distribution easier (some propietary drivers may not be caring
	about making their drivers work with 4Kb stacks due to the lack
	of uniformity)
