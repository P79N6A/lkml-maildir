1. It's not that I don't want to, but I _can't_ implement kprobes and not 
due to lack of skills, but lack of resources. (There is a subtle but 
important difference.)
2. I don't want LTT to be "all static tracer" at all, I want it to be 
usable as a static tracer, so that on archs where kprobes are available it 
can use them of course. This puts your second paragraph in a new 
perspective, since the userbase and thus the pressure for more and more 
static tracepoints would be different.
bye, Roman
