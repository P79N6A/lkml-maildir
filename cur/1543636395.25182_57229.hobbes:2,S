I got a Abit-KT7-RAID with a AMD Thunderbird 800 and also have seen lots 
of trouble. Finally I have figured out that reducing the memory bus 
clock to 100MHz (instead of 133MHz) make my system pretty stable (My 
memory modules can take 133MHz! I checked the specs.). Maybe that 
chipset memory tweaks that the linux kernel does are not enough to fix 
all memory problems...

Well, after messing around with the mobo for almost 2 years, it finally 
seems to be stable. But I wish I could have done useful stuff with my 
computer during that time.

I got to check this out!
