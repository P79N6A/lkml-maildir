Hi Simon.

Nothing that I can see. His/her comments sound like they have the same
basis as those heard on a so-called science documentary on TV recently
where the man being interviewed commented that he didn't drink milk
because the cows it came from might be on a farm that kept battery
hens, and he didn't believe battery hens was safe...
 > at least with man pages i can go "man iproute" and get something
On some of the systems I use, man pages are the ONLY form of
documentation available.

Personally, when I review a UNIX program to consider recommending it
to one or more of my clients, the lack of a man page gets an immediate
black mark, and documentation only in the so-called info format gets a
second one. The program with the fewest black marks gets recommended
to the customer, unless there is some over-riding reason to choose one
of the others.
Note that my use of UNIX in the above paragraph was deliberate, as I
get to advise clients running many different dialects of UNIX, Linux
being just one of them, and I follow the same procedure in every case.
Best wishes from Riley.
