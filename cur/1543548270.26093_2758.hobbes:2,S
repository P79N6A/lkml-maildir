Try make clean and recompile and test again. You probably didn't run
make depend after you applied the patch that included ECN, so the Makefile
doesn't know that it has to recompile the tcp* files when the ECN setting
changes.
BTW in pre8 there is no tcp_ecn sysctl anymore when the CONFIG is disabled.
