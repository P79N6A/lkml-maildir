Hm, can you think of some better wording that I might use for it?

Again, the kernel will only have "subminor release updates" as per the
number, but not as per what we are really doing here in the kernel.
And it only looks like it affected a subset of the distros out there, my
boxes all worked just fine, even with that config option turned off,
otherwise I would have caught it very early in testing.

Well, users should never want to strangle us, that means we messed up.
And yes, this was a bug, sorry.
As for why we are doing this kind of change, it makes sense from a
hierarchical point of view (one device tree, symlinks into the tree for
information that you need instead of many multiple device trees all
scattered around.)  It also properly gives us the "card" abstraction for
ALSA devices, something people have been asking for quite some time (in
order to do persistent device names and other stuff).  And it fixes a
number of suspend/resume issues by allowing the class core that controls
the device to be notified of a suspend/resume before the device is, so
that it can do common work without all of the individual drivers having
to be changed.

Where were they filed?  Should I be looking somewhere else for kernel
bug reports?

Some of the HAL developers knew about this a long time ago, as they were
one of the main people who did the kernel changes.  So I don't think
they were all unprepared :)

How would you go about making changes like the above?  I had two
choices:
	- fix all broken userspace programs for all old, unsupported
	  distros before making the change.  I actually started to do
	  this, but quickly got lost in a maze of old distro images...
	- add a kernel option that kept the old structure of sysfs, so
	  that people can slowly migrate over as their userspace
	  programs catch up and get updated in the future.
I implemented the latter, and so far, this is the only hic-up that has
been reported in the mainline kernel with it so far (there were bug
reports about stuff in the -mm tree, but that is what it is there for,
and they were quickly fixed.)

Note, I don't think that at all.  We are changing these userspace things
because we have learned and realize that after a few years of using this
model, things need to be tweaked to properly reflect the needs of the
real world.  It's almost impossible to get such a change right the first
time, and Linux relies on evolution of stuff in order to adapt properly.
Again, I'm providing a way to allow backward compatibility so that we do
not break anything that is currently out there.  So far no one has
objected to this :)

And there's a reason that I'm always using the latest experimental
userspace and use a distro that lets me do that :)
But I also have old machines that I don't update to ensure that things
still work properly.  Unfortunatly in this case, they were too old such
that the problem was never seen (pre-HAL-relying-gnome-distro).
