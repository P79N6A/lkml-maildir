Subject: [PATCH 1/2] vfs: support for COW files in sys_open: vfs changes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/8/213

Giving the O_COW flag to open() will return a special error, if
IS_COW(inode) and write permissions are expressed or implied.  COW-aware
applications may set this flag and deal with this error according to
some user defined policy.  This will not change the semantics of any
existing application or affect any kernel user of open_namei(); nor does
it affect future applications unless they use O_COW.  Filesystem level
code is unimplemented except for an ext2 example.

A self-serving and biased discussion of some objections to this proposal:
CON: It is too lightweight; it is trivial.
PRO: All previous proposals have failed due to being unable to solve the
     problems of _too_much_ kernel support.  This patch accomplishes the
     purpose of kernel support for preserving a file marked COW, by providing
     _mechanism_ in the kernel, not policy.  The userspace applications
     provide their own policy through options, config files, or whatever.
CON: In that case you will have inconsistent treatment of COW files.
PRO: Which is as it should be, as long as the goal of preserving COW files from
     being silently overwritten is supported.  Users will choose the tool -
     and policy - that they prefer.
CON: It is too heavy - all you really need is S_COW.
PRO: In that case each application must parse the filesystem type and
     then provide separate IOCTL's and filesystem-specific arguments
     for each filesystem type.  If the IOCTL changes, or if COW support is
     added to an existing filesystem, or a new filesystem is added which
     has it built-in, then the application has to be revised.  With this
     approach the COW-aware application need only add the flag O_COW to
     open() and be prepared to deal with getting back ECOW, for _any_ fs.
CON: It doesn't work for symlinked files; the path gets resolved to a
regular file.
PRO: It is the file to be protected that must be marked COW, since it may
     have many links to it, both hard and soft.  Setting a symlink  "S_COW"
     is probably meaningless.
CON: It blurs the semantics of hard linked files.
PRO: Policy is determined by the user; putting an extra layer of meaning
     on top of what the kernel provides is not improper.  Generally, if a
     file with multiple hard links is to be written it is better for it to
     be COW than not, since the application can if it wishes use the S_COW
     flag in the inode as a hint to preserve the content of the original.
NB:
  In all cases the application must open a file with O_COW for this patch to
have any effect.
