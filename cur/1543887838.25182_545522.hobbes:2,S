Andi added code to verify that we can actually execute on the processor
before protected mode (so we can still get a message out through the
BIOS.)  That code presumably doesn't know of the MSR that needs to be
touched.
That code is in assembly in Andi's version, my rewritten version has it
in C.  I should add this code.
