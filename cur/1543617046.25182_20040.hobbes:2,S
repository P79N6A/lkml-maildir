This is getting silly ... feeback like "ll is better than PK", "feels 
smooth", "is reponsive",  "my kernel
compile is faster than yours", etc. is not getting us any closer to the 
"how" of making a better kernel.
What's the goal? How should SMP and NUMA behave? How is success measured?
It would be good to be very clear on the ultimate purpose before making 
radical changes. All of
these changes are dancing around some vague concept of 
reponsiveness...so define it!
These comments seem to set a better tone for this thread, perhaps we can 
concentrate  on _useful_ debate
around some well defined goal.
