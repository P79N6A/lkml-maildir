Nope. There are no general slabs available for DMA32.
You could use a dma slab by specifying GFP_DMA. However, on i386 and 
x86_64 this will get you memory in the precious first 16MB. On IA64 and 
other platforms you will get memory < 4GB.
Another option is to use the page allocator and specify GFP_DMA32.
