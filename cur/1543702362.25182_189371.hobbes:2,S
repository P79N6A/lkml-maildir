XD2-latest, 2.6.1-rc3 as of now, RH9 as base distro; also using
  synaptics_drv.o from the 0.12.2 tarball, Radeon 7500 card.
The startup sequence of XD2 seems to hit a timing issue with 2.6.x
  kernels so that the top panel's applet icons aren't displayed in
  the panel itself.
That however is a minor problem - the big one is that if I don't
  go right-clicking the panel in some 10 seconds (which makes the
  icons appear, btw) my CPU usage goes to 100% with these in 'top':

[NB: the first process is notification-area-applet]
  and the desktop is only partially usable (it is still possible to
  have the root window menu activated, but nothing else apparently).
Eventually this leads to a stage where you can only Ctrl-Alt-Bksp
  out of X (or Alt-Fn to a console and kill the spinning processes).
If instead I'm not too slow and I prod the panel with a right-click
  on it, nothing of this happens and the desktop is as happy as with
  a 2.4.x kernel under the hood.
Since this is 100% reproducable and very easily, I'm available for
  testing and providing further info.
Thanks in advance, ciao,
