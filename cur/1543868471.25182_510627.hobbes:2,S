That should not happen if your interrupt handling is correct - okay, you
might get an interrupt at that point, but while servicing that interrupt
the source will be disabled on the interrupt controller.
You should _never_ _ever_ get recusive interrupts for the same interrupt
source.  Ever.  If you do, your platforms interrupt handling is seriously
buggy.

Linux assumes that all interrupt sources on a shared IRQ line are
disabled at the point in time when the kernel boots.  When a device
is to be used, an interrupt handler is installed and then the kernel
will enable the interrupt on the device, not before.
We follow that rule in the 8250 driver - in fact, when we initialise
we ensure that interrupts are disabled on any devices we find.
