You are personally volunteering to pay for the replacement of all of
the drives out there? My understanding of what Andre is saying is that
almost all currently existing drives are vulnerable.
That attitude might be acceptable if 20% of the drives were
vulnerable, but if 90% are vulnerable, things change. 
And the danger isn't from hostile root. The danger is from root
running software that's buggy and sends garbage to the disk. It's good
to make it harder to deliberately trash the disk, but yeah, root can
do it if root wants too.
But root shouldn't be able to do it *accidentally*.
