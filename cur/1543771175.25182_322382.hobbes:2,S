Subject: [PATCH][1/3] RapidIO support: core
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Adds a RapidIO subsystem to the kernel. RIO is a switched
fabric interconnect used in higher-end embedded applications.
The curious can look at the specs over at 
http://www.rapidio.org
The core code implements enumeration/discovery, management of
devices/resources, and interfaces for RIO drivers.
There's a lot more to do to take advantages of all the hardware
features. However, this should provide a good base for folks
with RIO hardware to start contributing.
