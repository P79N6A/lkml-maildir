Well, you "just" need utility like lscap which relisably shows what
permissions program is going to run with.
_IF_ you go for ext2-only solution, you may as well add capabilities
into ext2 directly.

Well - it changes something. You'll have to go out and tell everyone
"stickybit + immutable is deadly combination". Many times.
I do not have to do such things. setuid-marked executables actually
look more dangerous than they are. WHICH IS RIGHT.
