I wouldn't be that sure that all the other sites can cope with it as i 
only detected the problems with my code under heavy load ...

I browsed some code that's using hrtimers and found some hopefully good 
example in drivers/s390/crypto/ap_bus.c : They are using the hrtimer to 
schedule a tasklet which is running in soft-irq context:
http://lxr.linux.no/linux
+v2.6.27.8/drivers/s390/crypto/ap_bus.c#L1150
This could also be the correct approach for my sock_queue_rcv_skb() 
problem, right?
Regards,
Oliver
ps. What is the intended release for this hrtimer cleanup? 2.6.29?
