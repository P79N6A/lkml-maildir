That looks very cool to me at least - I'd find it helpful, I think.
Thank you.
One thing that I've wished for in the past which looks like it *might*
be trivial to do is to grab a raw version of the patch you already
put out in HTML format, eg if I surf down changesets and get to a page
like this:
http://linus.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/patch@1.1522?nav=index.html
|ChangeSet@-2w|cset@1.1522
except it got html formatted, so I can't play with it easily. Is there
any way to provide the raw format of that? If not, or you don't want to,
no problem - would just be convenient. This isn't a open source vs not
issue, it's just I often want one fix without the whole tree, and it'd
be a convenient place to grab it.

PS. If you could possibly generate the diffs with -p, whether you supply
them in raw format or not, it'd make them easier to read.
