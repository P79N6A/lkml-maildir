It unfortunately cannot be turned off ATM (it is "deprecation warning" where
someone is trying to warn you that the next release of gcc may not support
multi line strings anymore).

Longer inline assembly without multi strings is hard to read and very nasty
to edit, so I don't see that as a "cleanup", but as a pessimization towards
less maintainable code.
