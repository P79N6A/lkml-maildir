I don't think sending the patches around brings much advantage.
But I always also Cc'ed all submitters, maintainers and all people 
somehow involved with one or more of the regressions.
This sometimes required splitting the regression lists into 5-7 emails 
due to some vger rule of dropping emails with IIRC >= 30 recipients, but 
the required grouping of regressions also had the advantage that you 
often have regressions that might or might not be related grouped and 
discussed together.
And if you want to push people to work on regressions or get fixes 
into Linus' tree spamming their INBOX'es with personal copies of 
regression reports sometimes gets regressions fixed faster...
