Also, as we're fixing this a different way, could you clarify for me
which of the pieces of the original fix or related things (e.g. the
zone->all_unreclaimable stuff, yanking PG_wired stuff off the LRU,
maybe more) you wanted me to rework and send back in later?
I'm heading out for an hour or so, so I'll be slightly delayed getting
those things back to you.
