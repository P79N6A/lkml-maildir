The memory range used by kexeced kernel is also the usable memory range
in original kernel. Maybe should be: backup/restore memory used by both
the original kernel and the kexeced kernel. My English is poor.

This snapshot is not used for restore/resume. It is just used for
debugging. You can check the system state with these snapshots. So I
think it is useful even without recording filesystem changes.

I am not sure how useful is this. Maybe I can run a Redhat and a Debian
on my machine and switch between them.
