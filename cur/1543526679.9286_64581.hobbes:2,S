Subject: LILO falsely reports big kernel?

L-K,
Just now LILO has reported that my freshly compiled kernel was too big
(472855 bytes) which is smaller than some of the other kernels installed
here (617431 bytes, for example).  Oddly enough, when I recompiled using
bzImage instead of zImage, I got a kernel 1 byte bigger that LILO
accepted.  Is there some logical explanation for this behavior?
