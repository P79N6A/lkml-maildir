This makes me wonder why the hell you think you'll get help from this  
(open-source) list.  A large number of people on this list (including  
copyright-holders) consider what you are doing blatantly illegal,  
although nobody has yet gone to court over it.  Please reconsider  
your decision and either opensource your code or find a way to do it  
in userspace.  For example, it is quite easy to write a low-latency  
USB device driver completely in userspace with only standard kernel  
drivers.
Cheers,
