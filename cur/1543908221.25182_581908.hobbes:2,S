Yes, but open files and in-progress requests are lost at reconnect.

Sure.  Obviously one of the drawbacks of a stateful protocol is that
the server state can't survive a reconnect.
But that sort of reliability has never been the goal of sshfs.  And
even if that was needed, it could probably be much better handled in a
lower layer.
