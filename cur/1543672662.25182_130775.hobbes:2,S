As mentioned already, this was done by several people, including the 
maintainer.
But even if it wasn't, the fact is that new additions that break major 
architectures _will_ be reverted. No ifs, buts or maybes about it. If new 
code shows itself to be broken, it's going to get reverted, and the sooner 
the better. And in this case, the code was not just slightly broken, it 
was totally non-working, in ways that made it clear that it had NEVER 
worked as intended.
