Subject: [RFC] add module reference to struct tty_driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In digging into the tty layer locking, I noticed that the tty layer
doesn't handle module reference counting for any tty drivers.  Well, I've
known this for a long time, just finally got around to fixing it :)
Here's a patch against 2.5.56 that should fix this issue (works for
me...)
Comments?  If no one objects, I'll send it on to Linus, and add support
for this to a number of tty drivers that commonly get built as modules.
thanks,
