(which sits on top of the 4/4 patches, so might need some massaging to apply)

I'm not sure it's that straightforward really - doing the non-pgd aligned
split is messy. 2.5 might actually be much cleaner than 3.5 though, as we
never updated the mappings of the PMD that's shared between user and kernel.
Hmmm ... that's quite tempting.

Shrinking struct page sounds nice. Did Hugh's patch actually end up doing
that? I don't recall that, but I don't see why it wouldn't.
