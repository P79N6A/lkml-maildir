Hi all!
is there a fork-like C-wrapper for clone which would let write
something like:
  if ((pid=clone(0,SIGCHLD|CLONE_VM))==0) /* child */
    {
      child_code;
      _exit(0);
    }
  else
    {
      assert(pid>0); /* mother */
      mother_code;
      exit(0);
    }
I'm not thinking in glibc'__clone or Linus' clone.c example since
they encapsulate the main thread code in a function. (i.e. not
fork-like)
Can somebody point me to some sample code?
I'll thank a CC to my e-mail
cheers
