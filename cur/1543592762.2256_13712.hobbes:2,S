from the single unix standard:
	On failure, the objects pointed to by the readfds, writefds,
	and errorfds arguments are not modified. If the timeout interval
	expires without the specified condition being true for any of
	the specified file descriptors, the objects pointed to by the
	readfds, writefds, and errorfds arguments have all bits set to 0.
