Dear all: Im running 2.6.0-test4 here and today I started experiencing some weird behaviour: from time to time the system freezes for some minutes. When I gain the control back, running top shows 400mb/ram free but running dmesg I some "out of memory" messages. I was playing with some hardware in the weekend so Im not sure if this is a hardware failure. I'll do some other experiments (running memtest, etc) and I'll clarify if it's a hardware issue.
Some dmesg messages:
Out of Memory: Killed process 565 (xmule).
Out of Memory: Killed process 474 (apache).
Out of Memory: Killed process 727 (apache).
Out of Memory: Killed process 473 (apache).
Out of Memory: Killed process 726 (apache).
Out of Memory: Killed process 457 (apache).
Out of Memory: Killed process 3082 (apache).
Out of Memory: Killed process 2880 (xmule).
apache: page allocation failure. order:0, mode:0xd2
VM: killing process apache
thanks in advance
