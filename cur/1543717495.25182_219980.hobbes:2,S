Hi.
Does anybody know when this driver might become available?
I'm currently trying to operate a Marvell 88SX6041 with a binary only 
module and read operations from multiple disks are giving me grief :(
I've noticed that sata support will be going into 2.4.27 and the patch 
looks very clean.  Will backporting sata support to an older 2.4.20-pre2 
kernel (
http://source.mvista.com:14690//linuxppc_2_4_galileo
) be as 
hassle free?
Many thanks,
Alex
