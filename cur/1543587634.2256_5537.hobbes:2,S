Wrong problem description, really. The problem is not components starting  
with digits, the problem is all-numeric components as in alt.2600.
And the problem is that this hits a fast path in the classical news spool  
layout article create path. The code for this assumes that you have  
articles in the range X to Y, and you just got a new article, so you write  
a file called /var/spool/news/group/name/Y+1. You really do not want to  
cope with the possibility of a directory Y+1 existing in that place.
I think there are some other things that also get impacted on their fast  
path, but this is probably the most important.
And then, it's an ugly user interface: the classical spool layout does  
assume that you look at that scpool with Unix tools (like find and grep),  
not only via NNTP and the server.
