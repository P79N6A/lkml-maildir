   So it was my point - without flink() IMHO it makes no sense.
   Just try to imagine any application for sys_copy(char*,char*).
   None _I_ _can_ imagine.
   "int new_fd = sys_copy( old_fd );" make sense to me - but you need to 
have counter-part of it - "flink();" - to commit it to file system.
    You really do not need a copy of a file just for copy of a file.
    That's what hard link is for.
    My way vim/emacs can:
    fd = open("originalfile");
    new_fildes = copy(fd);
    close(fd);
     ... [do the editing] ...
    flink(new_fildes, "newfile"); /* if user decides to save this job */
    close(new_fildes);
    This make sense - and this is the way usually we do processing of 
information. Mimicing cp - is really bad example.
    I have re-read thread. I see flink() not as security hole - but they 
use should be managed in some way.
    Original thread about flink() - everthing doable.

    And there was no real security issue given whatsoever.
    Only design considerations ;-)

   The point, that different fs's can optimize this as they wish.
   This would be really nice thing to have in our networked age.
   Sshing just to copy huge file - is little bit annoying ;-)
P.S. actually my mind keeps spining idea of cut()/paste(). So file 
descriptor without assoc. file path can be useful.
Say:
    -----------
    fd_part_1 = open("some file");
    seek(fd_part_1, 100, 0);
    fd_part_2 = cut( fd_part_1 );  /* XXX */
    /* here eof(fd_part_1) == 1 && "some file" is truncated to 100b. */
    flink(fd_part_2, "second part"); /* create file
                    with rest of "some file" */
    -----------
    fd_part_1 = open("some file");
    fd_part_2 = open("second part");
    paste(fd_part_1, fd_part_2);   /* XXX */
            /* fd_part_2 is auto close()d
               and "second part" file unlinked */
    close(fd_part_1);
    /* here "some file" will be the same as in the begining */
    -----------
    This should help video/audio editing much.
P.P.S. not relevant but in any way SUSv3 docs for fattach()
