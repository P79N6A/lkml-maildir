Sorry for being late, I've just realized that you are discussing the freezer
here. ;-)

Well, the only code path in which we'd want to call cancel_freezing() for kernel
threads is when the freezing of kernel threads.  However, this only happens if
one of the kernel threads declares itself as freezable and the fails to call
try_to_freeze(), which is a bug.  Thus I don't think that we need to worry
about that case too much.
Moreover, I'm not sure that it's a good idea at all to send signals to kernel
threads from the freezer, since in fact we only need to wake them up to make
them call try_to_freeze() (after we've set TIF_FREEZE for them).
Greetings,
Rafael
