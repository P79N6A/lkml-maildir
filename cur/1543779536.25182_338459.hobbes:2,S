The Linux Kernel Debugger (
ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/kdb/download/v4.4
)
distinguishes between idle tasks, sleeping system daemons and the rest
(typically user tasks).  An idle task has pid 0, a sleeping system
daemon has a NULL mm field and is in S state, everything else is
treated as a normal task.
Download the latest kdb common patch and look at function
kdb_task_state_char.
