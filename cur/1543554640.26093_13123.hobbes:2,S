Greetings!  This is a known bug.  Andrea Archangeli has a "VM-global"
patch against some of the 2.2.18-pre which is reported to work.
My understanding is that there is still investigation as to whether
this patch fixes the problem in the best manner.  Should not be too
difficult to edit for 2.2.17, but I haven't done this yet.  Anyone
know of a VM-global against 2.2.17?
Take care,
