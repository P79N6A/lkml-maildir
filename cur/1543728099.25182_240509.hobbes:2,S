We didn't measure it, we just had lockup. In our code in the commands 
serialization we have two paths: the regular (fast) one, where the 
atomic value is equal to current value and there are no locks used, 
because only one command can be on the fast path, and the slow one, 
where the atomic and the current values are different, so lock used to 
perform all necessary job. After the fast path the atomic value gets 
incremented together with some checks on it. We used to use atomic_set() 
here and sometimes had lockup.

So, seems there is no difference between operations with and without 
"__" prefix (like set_bit() and __set_bit()) now? Maybe, it's worth to 
leave only one version of them?

Designing that we also be guided by the comments, which turned out to be 
misleading :).
Actually, I feel it would be perfect if someone wrote a document, where 
he described various issues with using atomic variables and bit 
operations on various architectures, like some FAQ. For example, this 
thread has at least several good questions and answers. Also, I can add 
one more question: for an user it could be non-obvious why 
smp_mb__after_atomic_*() and friends needed. This document wouldn't be 
big, so it didn't take too much time to write it, but it would help a 
*lot* for people who wish to write portable code.
Thanks,
Vlad
