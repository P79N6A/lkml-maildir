As promised yesterday, a Sourceforge project has been started for a Linux 
Kernel Patch Management System (lk-pms). The page is at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lk-pms/
A mailing has been set up for discussion of the development of the 
project. We would like to move the discussion off of linux-kernel onto 
this new mailing list and begin to formalize the concept and the design.
We (OSDL) are volunteering resources for the development of the project: 
developer time, hardware, and bandwidth. We are willing to host it on our 
servers, and would like to eventually integrate such a system with our 
automated test system (STP). Any and all feedback is welcome, preferably 
on the list, though private mail is also welcome. 
Thanks,
	-pat
