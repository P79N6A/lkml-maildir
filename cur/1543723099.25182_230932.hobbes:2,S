Not the signal part.  It was written for libc5.  There, signals set
with signal(2) were reset when raised (SysV-style).  Leaving such a
signal handler with longjmp was perfectly valid.
Glibc2 changed the rules: signals set with signal(2) are not reset
but blocked during delivery (BSD-style).  It worked for a while
because the kernel ignored the sigmask for some signals.
So, if one is to blame then glibc2 by breaking compatibility.
With Davide's patch the kernel would be a little bit more tolerant to
old code by keeping the 2.4 behaviour.  The current strict behaviour
becomes OK when signal(2) is no longer part of glibc...
Ciao, ET.
