Yeah, I was going to, but I had this version ready to go so decided
to leave them in at the last minute. We can definitely take them out
if people agree.
However a side note about intr -- I wonder if it might be wise to
include a flags argument, in case we might want to add something like
that later? (definitely if we do keep intr, then it should be done as
a flag rather than its own int).

Yep, simple oversight on my part.

OK that's very cool. I was hoping that would be the case. If GFS2 can
avoid that too, then we might be able to get rid of AOP_TRUNCATE_PAGE
handling from the legacy prepare/commit_write paths, which will make
them simpler.

OK, well I'll add this to my queue for now, and post the full patchset
after incorporating feedback I've had so far, and doing more testing,
so people can actually apply them and boot kernels.
Thanks,
Nick
