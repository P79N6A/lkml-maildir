You may keep gcc at version 2.7.2.3 and still do regular debian
upgrades.
1. Install gcc (and cpp) version 2.7.2.3
2. Run dselect, put gcc and cpp "on hold".  (I.e. select gcc, then press
the
   = key.  Then do the same for cpp.
You can now use dselect or apt and do yor updates, upgrades, or
dist-upgrades,
and nothing bad will happen to gcc 2.7.2.3  No new gcc will ever be
downloaded or installed until you "un-holds" the old gcc.
