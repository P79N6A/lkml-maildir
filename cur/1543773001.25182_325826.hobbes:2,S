Subject: [-mm PATCH][2/4] net: signed vs unsigned cleanup in net/ipv4/raw.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch gets rid of the following gcc -W warning in net/ipv4/raw.c :
net/ipv4/raw.c:387: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false
Since 'len' is of type size_t it is unsigned and can thus never be <0, and 
since this is obvious from the function declaration just a few lines above 
I think it's ok to remove the pointless check for len<0.
