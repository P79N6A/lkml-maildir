I mean review process - It is low priority task for maintainers, 
so can be preempted, no problem.

From the other point of view - how can someone use the interface, if it
is
not in the kernel tree?
Main connector idea was not system accounting, but it was designed
so that it can be usefull in other places, like accounting.
The main idea was to simplify userspace control and notification
system - so people did not waste it's time learning how skb's are
allocated
and processed, how socket layer is designed and what all those
netlink_* and NLMSG* mean if they do not need it.
As you can see in kobject_uevent.c changes - it is significant amount of
code
that can be removed if connector is used without _any_ advantages for 
not using connector.
But, of course the main word is yours, so you still may allow growing
netlink uids and socket allocation all over the place.
P.S. udev may also use it directly - for example with some notification
from ->open() syscall for /dev/something_major_minor and
that "something" does not exist  :)
