use the config file.  we have config files for mounts, we have config files for
modules, etc.

as are attributes on a variety of items.  dynamically changed attribs can be
done with scripting, daemons; userland or kernel.  this is a 1:1 debate point.

how?  should we throw away /proc and other magic filesystems because they
aren't true blocks of data on physical disc media?

how?  i've been using devfs for well over a year and i find managing devices
much easier and less time consuming.  "unixy" needs to keep pace with today's
technology needs.  devfs is certainly a step in that direction.

there's a good lot that impacts every single driver, memory routines come to
mind.  function naming semantics, etc.

i have pcmcia and hotswap items everywhere.  i transfer hardware *frequently*.
devfs makes things easier.  with the amount of admin work i do, convenient
administration is terribly wonderful.

makes handling devices exactly correct.  /dev/sda could be any of disc.
/dev/sd/c0b0t0u0 is precisely one disc.
an uncluttered /dev/ is immensely make-me-happy helpful.  i have several
systems with LARGE process tables that do a lot of work in /dev.  having a
dynamic /dev is considerably helpful in keeping the file op load down.

in my experience, devfs has uncovered existing bugs in other software and fixed
such things as tty ownership and permissions.  remember all the dribble about
*xvt and tty permissions?

then you may certainly answer "no" when you scroll past it in your config
options for building the kernel.  i will clearly choose "yes" just like i do
for every other option i need in my kernel.
should we remove all portions of the kernel with SMP in it because you may not
have an SMP machine?
this is a silly debate.  would you also argue that pcmcia shouldn't go in the
kernel because you may not have pcmcia?
