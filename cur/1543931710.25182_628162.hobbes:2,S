Come on, are we playing hide and seek here?
You can use strace to follow a typical hello world example and
see what device it opens to feed the hello out.
I.e. it can be to the current /dev/ttyX and not to /dev/console
or if you are logged in via SSH to a machine, the device
is again different... or if you use screen, ...
Work your way from there and then use a Linux Source code
Cross Reference (lxr, ask Google for one) and follow the code.
