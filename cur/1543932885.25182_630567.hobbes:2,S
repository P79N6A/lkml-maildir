I don't think this is explicitly documented anywhere, but it certainly
seems that we want the bus address to be page-aligned in this case.
For mthca/mlx4 at least, we tell the adapter what the host page size
is (so that it knows how to align doorbell pages etc) and I think this
sort of thing would confuse the HW.
