As long as glibc compiles by default with 32-bit ino_t, the problem exists 
and is severe --- programs handling large files, such as coreutils, tar, 
mc, mplayer, already compile with 64-bit ino_t and off_t, but the user (or 
script) may type something like:
cat >file.c <<EOF
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
main()
{
 	int h;
 	struct stat st;
 	if ((h = creat("foo", 0600)) < 0) perror("creat"), exit(1);
 	if (fstat(h, &st)) perror("stat"), exit(1);
 	close(h);
 	return 0;
}
EOF
gcc file.c; ./a.out
--- and you certainly do not want this to fail (unless you are out of disk 
space).
The difference is, that with 32-bit program and 64-bit off_t, you get 
deterministic failure on large files, with 32-bit program and 64-bit 
ino_t, you get random failures.
