Steve,
I'll get you a copy of NWDISK which creates netware partitions.  I have not
uploaded it yet becuase our QA guy, Larry Angus won't let me send it out
until he's finished testing it.  He is very thorough.  I will check with him
tommorrow and see where he is at, and perhaps I can convince him to let me
send it out early before he finishes all of his testing.
Jeff
