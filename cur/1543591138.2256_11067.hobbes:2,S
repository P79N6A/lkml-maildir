It stops to be repetable unless you are able to define *which* interface
become eg. eth0 after boot. Think of hotplug...

Not true. I did. Once :)

Consider the following situation:
- you have three ethernet adapters supported by a single driver; assume
  they are *significantly* different
- you hotplug a spare adapter, supported by the same driver
- your spare adapter become eth0 after reboot...
- you need access to a NFS server on former eth2 during boot
How would you configure the system to boot regardless the spare adapter is
plugged in or not?

ifconfig eth-00:20:12:34:ab:cd ?
I'd prefer using MAC address here, but it is also not good as MAC need not
to be unique.

Unfortunately sometimes it is. Rare cases. I used to hit one.

Not good comparison. You can mount filesystems on disks by UUID.
You should be independent on disk names then.
