Subject: [patch 1/1] Added NO_IOAPIC_CHECK in io_apic_get_unique_id() for ACPI boot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch allows xAPIC systems that don't have serial bus for interrupts delivery to by-pass the check on uniquness of IO-APIC IDs. Some of ES7000's panic failing this unnecessary check. The genapic mechanism has NO_IOAPIC_CHECK flag, which is defined in each subarch. The MP boot utilizes it, but the ACPI boot is missing it.
