I faced the similiar issue on one of my machine. Little debugging showed that
Boot cpu sends an INIT IPI to application processor to wake it up and then boot
cpu loses its way and jumps to bios. Strange....
Further, in my case this problem was noticed only if crash happened on non-boot
cpu.
It works well with Uniporcessor capture kernel. For the time being sufficient 
to capture the dump but it is always good idea to be able to boot and SMP kernel
as well.
Thanks
