sg3_utils is a package of command line utilities for sending
SCSI (and some ATA) commands to devices. This package targets
the lk 2.6 and lk 2.4 series. In the lk 2.6 series these
utilities (except sgp_dd) can be used with any devices that
support the SG_IO ioctl.
This version adds the sg_map26 utility which maps between
a primary scsi device node (e.g. /dev/hdc) and the
corresponding scsi generic node (e.g. /dev/sg5) or vice
versa. Uses major/minor numbers and sysfs (thus only works
for the lk 2.6 series).
sg_dd now takes iflag and oflag options similar to those
found in recent GNU dd versions.
"sg_inq -rr" outputs an ATA IDENTIFY response in a form
suitable to be piped to "hdparm --Istdin" for decoding.
See CHANGELOG for more information.
