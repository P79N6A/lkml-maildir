While this is probably inevitable, it would be nice if there was some
way to determine the actual coding system used for individual files.
Especially if we're mixing latin1 and utf8 in the same tree.  Has
something like adding "/* -*- coding: utf-8; -*- */" or similar to the
top of converted files been considered?
