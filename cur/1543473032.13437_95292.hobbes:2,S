Hello!
OK, I took into account your troubles and did new diff.
As I understand it is invariant wrt libc now.
Seems, I forgot to tell about some rules of src/obj/Config customization:
- configuring gii implies that -lcrypt is added to ldoptions or
  that crypt sits in libc.
- also configuring gii implies that RIB_HASH option is set.
  Actually, I am not sure that RIB_RADIX options works at all.
- NO_ANK_FIX must NOT be defined.
- with normal libc5 -lresolv option should be removed.
Seems, for now it is all.
Alexey
