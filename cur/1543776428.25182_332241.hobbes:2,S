I think I know what happens. In 2.6.12 we started dropping the conntrack
reference when a packet leaves IP, so packets on loopback are tracked
twice (LOCAL_OUT/PRE_ROUTING). TCP connection tracking destroys a
conntrack entry when the only reply is an RST. So when the packet is
tracked for the second time in PRE_ROUTING, the conntrack entry can't
be found anymore and the packet is considered invalid.
You could confirm this theory by logging invalid packets in LOCAL_OUT
and in PRE_ROUTING - only PRE_ROUTING should trigger. I'm going to
think about a solution meanwhile.
