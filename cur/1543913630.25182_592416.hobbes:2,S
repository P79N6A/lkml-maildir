 Notes on loading the dump-capture kernel:
 
 * By default, the ELF headers are stored in ELF64 format to support
-  systems with more than 4GB memory. The --elf32-core-headers option can
-  be used to force the generation of ELF32 headers. This is necessary
-  because GDB currently cannot open vmcore files with ELF64 headers on
-  32-bit systems. ELF32 headers can be used on non-PAE systems (that is,
-  less than 4GB of memory).
+  systems with more than 4GB memory. On i386, kexec automatically checks if
+  the physical RAM size exceeds the 4 GB limit and if not, uses ELF32.

 * The "irqpoll" boot parameter reduces driver initialization failures
   due to shared interrupts in the dump-capture kernel.
