Look at this:
[1]int init_module(void)
[2]{
[3]  orig_fsync=sys_call_table[SYS_fsync];
[4]  sys_call_table[SYS_fsync]=hacked_fsync;
[5]  return 0;
[6]}
Unless there is a LOCK on sys_call_table[SYS_fsync] another CPU could
replace the pointer between lines 3 and 4. At that point line 4 would
destroy the existing entry.. or destroy it when the original is restored,
and would NOT be restoring the one insterted.
