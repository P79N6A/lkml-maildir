Hi. What I want to do is to intercept the ip_rcv symbol with a lkm.
However this seems to me like a difficult task. Intercepting syscalls is
well documented, but intercepting kernel symbols is not. Maybe it's
impossible or maybe just uncommon? So if anyone could help me out a
little, or point me in the right direction, it would be greatly
appreciated. 'Cause I've been spending a few weeks now reading and playing
with it, and I'm just getting nowhere.
Thanx
