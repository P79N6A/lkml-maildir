I was forgetting that extending ftruncate wasn't supported in 2.6.14 and
earlier, yes.  But I'm afraid the above scenario can still happen there:
extending is done, not by ftruncate, but by (somewhere else) mmapping the
larger size.   So your fix may still cause a tight infinite fault loop.

Sorry, no, you're dreaming there.  And I very much doubt we'd want
to implement such a behaviour!  (But yes, it's a good example of why
several of us are quite unhappy with the extend-to-fill-mmap behaviour.)

As you made clear in your other mail: sorry for wasting your time
with my ignorant confusions!
