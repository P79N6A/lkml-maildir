I should have said a little more.  I couldn't find anywhere in any docs
for this that said it was a destructive read.  I've done some experiments
and that seems to be the case, though.
So two things:
There are other bits in this register that also appear to be destroyed on
read: framing, parity, and overrun.  Should those be saved, too?
There are several places where the LSR is read and nothing is done
for this, in serial8250_start_tx, serial8250_backup_timeout, and
serial8250_tx_empty.  It seems like these would need to be handled,
too.
If this is really a problem, I'd be glad to generate another patch.
