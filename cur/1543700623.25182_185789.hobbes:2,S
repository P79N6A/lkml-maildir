Subject: kernel-2.6.0/esd/realplayer8 doesn't work

Hi, all
   I just installed kernel-2.6.0 release on debian-testing.   On my box esd
works with xmms, mpg123 as with kernel-2.4.xx series, however, only
Realplayer8 cannot use esd at all.  Realplayer says "cannot open audio
device, Another application may be using it."  Sounds strange.   It works
very fine with the very same configuration on kernel 2.4.23.
   As a matter of course module-init-tools are installed for kernel-2.6.0.
Strange thing is xmms, mpg123 works, but that realplayer doesn't work.  And
when some weeks ago I tested kernel 2.6.0-test6/7, realplayer worked as
expected.
  Will anybody have any idea?   I once suspect it should be related to
connection between realplayer and esd, but if so kernel version doesn't
matter.   So there should be another reason;for eg. esound doesn't keep up
with kernel development...just a guess.
PS: I recompiled esound daemon 0.2.32 with kernel 2.6.0 for sure.
TIA
