There may be more 2.0 users than you would expect. I have 5 or 6
machines with 2.0.x, and in our office there are 4 more.

This is probably true...

I dont know much about 2.0.x problems, here's what I know:
- driver updates for ncr53c8xx, network cards etc.
- compiling a i486 kernel on an i586 machine may make the kernel
  unbootable or otherwise faulty on a 486 (binutils bug?)
- integrating the bootprom patch and swapping over NFS would be nice.
  (patches worked for 2.0.34, not for newer versions)
