Looking at how few is left from kcalloc, can't we make it a
"static inline" function in slab.h?
This would optimize nicely for all of the users where the first or even 
the first two parameters are constant at compile-time and shouldn't do 
much harm for the other users.
As a side effect, the difference between kcalloc(1, ...) and kzalloc() 
would become a coding style question without any effect on the generated 
code.
