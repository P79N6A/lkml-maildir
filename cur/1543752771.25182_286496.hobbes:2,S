I'm not sure if that is a really good comparison.

Now I'm not adverse to cool hacks, and I haven't thought about
SCHED_ISO enough to comment on it much (nor has its behaviour
even been firmly defined as far as I know).
But regarding the kernel in general and the scheduler especially:
it is pretty important to fight feature creep. SCHED_ISO will have
a non zero cost in terms of complexity, maintainability, and
probably performance.
So the only way it can go in is if a non trivial number of people
really need it for things that can't be satisfied in userspace or
with a good privilege system or [something elegant], etc.
I'm not by any means stopping anyone from coming up with a firm
definition for SCHED_ISO, implementing it, and demonstrating that
it is the best way to solve a problem that X people care about,
and that its benefits outweigh its inevitable costs...
I'm just giving some frank advice.

I'm not too sure, that topic's out of my league... But that is
basically what is sought after by the guys behind the realtime LSM.
So I'd better stop hijacking their thread!
