I'm working on this actually.  See this (and related patches) in -mm:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.22-rc4/2.6.22-rc4-mm2/broken-out/unprivileged-mounts-add-user-mounts-to-the-kernel.patch
This solves the "user=" thing, but is not a generic solution for other
options.  And I'm wondering if there is really a need for that.
Which quota options are you thinking about?  Some quota options
(e.g. for ext*) seem to be already present in /proc/mounts.
There's also "loop=", but that's not really a per-mount option, but a
per-loop-device option, so it could be stored separately under /var.
Do you know any other options which are only in /etc/mtab, and need to
be stored along with each mount?
