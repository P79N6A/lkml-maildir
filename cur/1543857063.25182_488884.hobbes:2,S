If the complaint is true; i.e. infinite retries, this is just a bandaid
not a fix.  What it's doing is marking the unrecoverable medium errors
for no retry.  However, what we really need to know is why NEEDS_RETRY
isn't terminating after its allotted number of retries.  Can we please
have a trace of this?

What exactly is this supposed to be doing?  its result is identical to
the code it's replacing (because of the way scsi_end_request() processes
its second argument), so it can't have any effect on the stated problem.
