This is S25mdadm-raid.

At this point, it looks like something already grabbed hold of /dev/hdb.
Both evms and lvm get started here, right after S25mdadm-raid.
This is just a hunch, but you might try disabling either of the two.
Also, it might help if you'd post the output of 'fdisk -l /dev/hdb' to
see what's on it.  The output of 'pvs' might help, too.
I have no clue why this error only shows up with the vanilla kernel and
not with the Ubuntu one, though :-/
Bye,
Oliver
