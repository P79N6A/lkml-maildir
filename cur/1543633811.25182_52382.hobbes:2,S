   Still does that justify the overhead and the complications ?
   Couldn't we provide for the worst case in a generic kernel
   and make it a compile time option ?
I already posted that using the worst case scenerio would be an
acceptable solution to this problem, I consider it a closed issue
and you can ignore my earlier gripes on this issue.
