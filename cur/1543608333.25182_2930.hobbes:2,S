Not freeing the memory is expected and normal.  The previously-mlocked file 
data remains cached in that memory, and even though it's not free, it's 
'easily freeable' so there's no smoking gun there.  The reason the memory is 
freed on umount is, there's no possibility that that file data can be 
referenced again and it makes sense to free it up immediately.
On the other hand, the 0-order failures and oom-kills indicate a genuine bug.
