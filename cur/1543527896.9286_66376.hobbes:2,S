Preface this with the obligatory "I am not a kernel hacker.  If this
message is stupid, just ignore me."
Regarding parsing /proc files, has anyone thought of a file format which
contains a parsing specification ?  For example a scanf format string.
Eg:
$ cat /proc/somefile
%d %d %f %s
12 45 8.4 Some String
Scanf may not be the best way to do this, but you get the idea.
