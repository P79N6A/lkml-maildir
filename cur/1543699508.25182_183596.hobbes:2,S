Subject: [2.4.23] cursor dissapears in framebuffer console after switching back from X

This is 100% reproduceable on my machine. When I boot Linux the cursor can be
seen. then I start XFree86 and when I switch back to the framebuffer console
with ALT-CTRL-F(x) it is not there anymore. I am using tdfx.o with a Voodoo
3 2000 PCI, XFree86 4.3.0 (Slackware 9.1). If more information is needed I'll
be glad to provide it.
