Yes, it's 100% reproducible. But I do not get any message. Display is
shutting down, and no more access with ssh. Ctrl-Alt-Del does not work
neither. Nothing in /var/log/messages.
Of course, I can try to narrow down to the specific patch, if you send me
the different patches. I only have the diff between 2.6.12.4 and 2.6.12.5
and I don't know how to extract the patches.
Cheers, Peter
