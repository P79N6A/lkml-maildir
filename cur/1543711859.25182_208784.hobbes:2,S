Hi,
I am current doing a project to save the energy consumed by the wireless
network card. I know IEEE 802.11 supports a PSM mode. But I need to go a
further step: explicitly switching the card states (e.g., from idle to
sleep or from sleep to active) in the kernel or user space. Can anyone
help me on this? Thanks and appreciate your help.
