One can combine cgroups into a single hierarchy.
If we had irqs and these similar mechanisms you have in mind each in
their separate cgroup subsystem, and if you normally wanted to deal
with them all in a single hierarchy, then you can mount those cgroup
subsystems together.
I've manage to avoid learning how to use cgroups, so you might want
to ask Paul Menage (just added to the cc list) how to do that, if the
Documentation/cgroups.txt isn't sufficient.
