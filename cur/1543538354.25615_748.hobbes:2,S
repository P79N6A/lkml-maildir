I have one too. ;) Celeron 500 and only 12gig drive tho. ;)

I have seen this problem with two other of my cards...
- A sandisk compact flash adapter: It loads fine, and I can mount the
  flash and copy files to/from it fine. When I unload it, (after
  unmounting the fs) I get the big string of oopses and the machine is
  locked. 
- A webgear aviator wireless card. It also loads ok, but rmmoding the
  ray_cs module or ejecting the card also results in the same string
  of oopses and a locked machine. 
I have found a workaround (for the ray_cs card at least) is to compile
the wireless stuff from the latest pcmcia-cs package and install it
into /lib/modules/2.4.0-test2/pcmcia or whatever. That version works
fine.

Are you in X when you suspend? 
There is a patched X server that will work with suspend on the 5000
at:
http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~steveh/inspiron/XMa64-3.3.6-steveh.tar.gz
 
Or you can switch to a vty (cntrl-alt-f1) and suspend and then back to
your X session when you resume.

The oopes I see scroll by in a blinding blur. I guess a serial or
printer console could capture them. ;) 
Tom> Later, Tom
