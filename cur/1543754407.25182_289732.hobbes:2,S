This would be perfectly fine. The order of unlocking doesn't really 
matter. It is the actual locking that must be carried out on the same 
order everywhere to guarantee that there are no deadlocks.

I haven't look at the code yet, but this is a deadlock waiting to 
happen. "place 1" gets "lock a", then is interrupted and "place 2" gets 
"lock b". "place 2" waits forever for "lock a" and "place 1" waits 
forever for "lock b". Deadlock.
