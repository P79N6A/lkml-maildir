I don't understand.  The dmesg log you attached shows the iPod was
detected and recognized as scsi5 (sdc).  Then some time later (can't tell
how much later because you don't have CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME set) it was
unplugged and plugged back in.  The second time it was detected and
recognized as scsi6 (also sdc).  And then the log ends.
Why do you say there are no messages from the iPod?  Grepping for "iPod"
in the log shows that the string appears 4 times.  If nothing happened
when you plugged it in, how could the computer have known the device was
an iPod?

You mean you suspend or shutdown the computer?  Or the iPod?

What's so strange about that?  Isn't that exactly what's supposed to 
happen?
