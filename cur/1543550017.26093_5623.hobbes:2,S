Subject: Module unresolved symbol on 2.4.0-test8 SMP

I'm getting the following error when trying to load a module under a
2.4.0-test8 SMP kernel:
[root@porsche13 themod-dev]# insmod themod.o
themod.o: unresolved symbol write_lock
themod.o: unresolved symbol read_lock
The module was compiled with the following options (in a
sub-sub-subdirectory of the kernel source):
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -march=i686
-fno-strict-aliasing  -D__SMP__ -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -DLINUX -Dlinux 
-DDEBUG -I../../../include -c themod.c 
This has me really puzzled.  I've checked out the file
include/asm/spinlock.h & gone so far as to introduce a compiler error
into the read_lock() inline function.  The compiler reported the error,
so I know that the read_lock() inline function is being seen when I
build the module.  However, I continue to get these unresolved symbol
errors when I try to load the module.
The compiler version I am using is:
egcs-1.1.2-30
I also tried gcc-2.7.3.2 and received the same error.
The module loads and works fine under the uniprocessor 2.4.0-test8
kernel.
Any suggestions on what I am screwing up would be greatly appreciated.
