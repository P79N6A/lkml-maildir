This isn't as easy as you think. The number of broken BIOS's that have
the current, last full or design either as 0xFFFF, 0xFFFFFF, 0, 1mV, or
10000mV rather than the present (correct) value is a big problem.
We've got quite a bit of code in HAL to try and sort out all the quirks,
although it only works most of the time due to extreme hardware
brokenness.
