this is exactly the problem.

Do you agree it should be fixed by returning a PFN from ->nopage? or are
you doing it differently with remap_file_pages or peraphs you're just
multiplying the right pfn for sizeof(page_t) ingoring the misleading API?

you mean in the non-x86 archs right?
there is no way I can change ->nopage to return a pfn right now (this
stuff must work stable ASAP), so I'm currently teaching do_no_page to
handle non-ram pages (for the first time ever it will be able to do
that), I expect this at least will make it work right on x86 w/o iommu.
for mainline 2.6 if we want to keep using ->nopage I agree with Wli that
an API change is reasonable.
BTW, I was wrong talking about machine checks, the problem here is
reading random _virtual_ address (not phyisical ones), so it could oops
too on x86, and starting from 2.6.5-rc1 it'll corrupt mem too.
