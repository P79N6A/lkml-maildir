Why's that?  Don't some things get preferentially allocated out of highmem?

It's probably better to use __get_cpu_var() rather than per_cpu(X,
smp_processor_id());  It's a real pity there's no ^^ operator...

The comment only talks about disabling interrupts for lazy_mmu, but this
seems to do it for lazy_cpu as well.  Is that OK?  What happens if
someone wants to change interrupt states under lazy_cpu; I can't think
of an inherent reason why that wouldn't be allowed (though I don't think
it happens now).
This kind of logic is a bit clunky anyway; would it be better to simply
have separate enable/disable functions?  Or at least separate functions
per mode?
Anyway,
