However, they *DO* work over the MTU/MRU=296 PPP link.
They just don't work over masquerading.
Meaning, the fragments are coming through OK, and *my* kernel
is *supposed* to "ALWAYS_DEFRAGMENT", which is *supposed* to
mean (as I understand it), that if it works at all (over 296),
it should work (over the 1500 eth0 forwarding).  Maybe it does
defragment to *larger* than 1500, and then just doesn't *re-*
fragment it down to under 1500?  I dunno until I spend some time
in tcpdump and ip_input.c or whatever, I guess...
