BIOS bug. Reading /proc/apm causes the APM BIOS to switch the CPU to
SMM mode with interrupts disabled so it can slowly poll the battery
about it's status. Result: lost interrupts, dropped frames, dropped
serial characters, clock slowdown. Workaround: don't use a battery
monitor, or don't let it poll every two seconds.
