Good day, Stefan,
	My apologies if you've already received responses to this...

	To make use of both processors in compiling, add
MAKE="make -j 3"
	at the end of any make commands you run.  For example:
make zImage MAKE="make -j 3"
make modules MAKE="make -j 3"
etc.
	The "3" is the number of simultaneously executed commands; I
suggest putting this at your number of processors +1.  This does a pretty
good job of keeping your CPU's busy even when one of those gcc's is
waiting on disk I/O.

	Not at all; we all have to learn sometime.  Cheers,
