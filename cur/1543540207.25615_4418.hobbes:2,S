You can do that in /opt or /usr/local if you like.

/lib/modules is probably the easiest place to get some agreement. The
contents of that directory is not specified as of FHS 2.1. 
This discussion should probably be done on the FHS list so that the
results can written up in that document. It currently mandates that
(for example) /usr/include/linux points at /usr/src/linux/include/linux.
