Which kernel version are you referring to? It certainly worked in 2.1/2.2.
I haven't tested with 2.3 so far, but mainly because vfat (well, actually
it's the fat part we're talking about) is painfully slow on MO media. What
makes you think it's broken? Have you had a look at the comment in
bigblock_fat_bread() (fat/buffer.c)? Note that fat uses a logical sector
size of 512 bytes, regardless of the hardware sector size.
Daniel.
