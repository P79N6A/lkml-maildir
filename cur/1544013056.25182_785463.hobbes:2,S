Subject: [PATCH 4/4] ufs: copy symlink data into the correct union member
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/31/167

Copy symlink data into the union member it is accessed through. Although
this shouldn't make a difference to behaviour it makes the code easier
to follow and grep through. It may also prevent problems if the
struct/union definitions change in the future.
