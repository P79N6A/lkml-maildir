Perhaps, but it isn't clear that it would be worth the cycles to check. 
    I doubt that a simple reference count on the ACK skb would do it 
since if it were a bare ACK I doubt that TCP keeps a reference to the 
skb in the first place?
Also, what would be the "trigger" to send the next ACK after the 
previous one had left the building (Elvis-like)?  Receipt of N in-order 
segments?  A timeout?
If you are going to go ahead and try to do stretch-ACKs, then I suspect 
the way to go about doing it is to have it behave very much like HP-UX 
or Solaris, both of which have arguably reasonable ACK-avoidance 
heuristics in them.
But don't try to do it quick and dirty.
