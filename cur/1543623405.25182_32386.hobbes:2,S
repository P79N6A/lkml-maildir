The petition never mentioned "force".  And even if Linus (and the other
core maintainers) wanted to, they couldn't *force* anyone to use
BitKeeper.  The issue at hand is the strong pressure the official
advocacy places on the perhipheral developers.  We (the signers of the
petition), and others are unhappy with this.  That's what the petition
says.
