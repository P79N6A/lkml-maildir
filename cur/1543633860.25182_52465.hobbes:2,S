Actually, the card seems to be detected, but:
	PCI: Device 01:00.0 not available because of resource collisions
Can you enable PCI debugging and send a full log of that? The DEBUG stuff
is sadly a manual diff and a recompile: please manually enable DEBUG in
arch/i386/pci/pci.h and in drivers/pci/*.c (yes, there's not even one
global place, you have to do it individually for each *.c file, ugh).
