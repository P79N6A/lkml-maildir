just had another look at iproute2 and friends after another year of development
is it right that such an important part of the linux kernel (albeit user space)
should not have adequate documentation? what is there uses tex. how about some
manual pages?
i'm not trying to be rude to Alexey, but ifconfig/route/netstat/etc have been
around for many years and are well documented. if we are replacing them, shouldn't
they be replaced with something with something that is documented to an acceptable
level.
