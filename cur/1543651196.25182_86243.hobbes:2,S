Lots of people no longer include Xaw either nowdays 8)
Probably the easiest way to do this would be to move the GUI tools out
of the kernel (or maybe leave the common useful ones) and have make
guiconfig do
	if [ -f /usr/sbin/kernel-gui-config ] ; then
		/usr/sbin/kernel-gui-config
	elif got_qt() ; then
		qt config
	elif got_gtk() ; then
		gtk_config
	else
		warnign message
		make config
	fi
