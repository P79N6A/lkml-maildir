 from my reply to pazke <pazke@ports.donpac.ru>

I took the sanpshot of the dmesg after loading the module if my word is not
enough i can reboot with the module disabled but i do not see the point...
The truth is that the bug prevented me from loading/installing the nvidia
module becouse i could not use sudo. Only when i rebooted into single mode
where the problems went away i could build and install the module...
