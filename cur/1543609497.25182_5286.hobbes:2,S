Fair enough (and I make no pretence to knowing where to start to address
the real problem here).
Meanwhile, for those of us that have either suspected or confirmed
problems with the VIA686a workaround (<sigh> possibly due to entirely
different hardware/BIOS bugs? </sigh>), a method of nobbling the VIA686a
fix at compile or boot time could be somewhat useful?  Mmm... boot-time is
probably best as it allows easiet experimentation?
Thanks,
Neale.
