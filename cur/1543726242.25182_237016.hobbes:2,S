I have to say that I didn't really carefully read the papers for
your stuff and I still don't exactly understand what's going on
with your nanokernel. It sounds interesting, but it doesn't solve
what I think are inescapable preemption problems with the Linux
kernel.

Complexity is a kind of relative terms in this conversation. It's
more of a function of what one is uses here verses what other folks
have been doing outside of Linux. I personally don't think it's THAT
hard. It's just that folks inside Linux have really gotten comfortable
using spinlocks for everything instead of another style of thinking.
It's all learnable after you get over the shock and not as hard as
folks think it would be.

I don't immediately see why this is going to give us hard RT for Linux
applications. I'd like a short explanation if you have time to reply
to this.

I don't really understand what RTAI fusion is and I would like
some pointers to this. I've read the web page for this, but I wasn't
able to extract a good chunk of information that would give me a
clear picture of what it does.

Well, you have to think of it in a wider scope for a bit. If you
want rate-guarateed streaming partition support from SGI's XFS,
touching dcache, VM, etc... then you have to dealing with
non-preemptable locking throughout the Linux kernel, no choice.
Having a pervasive model is a superior solution to dual kernels
since you have the full support of Linux verses the constrained
semantics and APIs of a controlled sub-domain. That typically needs
to be temporarly buffered (and API) both in and out of the a
Linux sub-system. I fail to see how a nano-kernel, RTAI and other
supporting kernel sub-systems can get around this problem without
solving preemption issues within Linux.
When you think of things like this you have to think of what's
happening now with applications that include the traditional RT
stuff as well as media driven apps, which are becoming more and
prevalent as little things like cell phone devices get more and
more bandwidth. For media driven applications, none of the
secondary/dual kernel or things like that can properly deal with
things like IO thread/channel bonding, which depends on various
IO layers that touch many SMP locked critical sections/systems
in the kernel. Running into Linux's SMP locking logic in these
cases are inescapable, so I don't see a choice but doing some
kind of full lock conversion.
Anytime you have an application that uses a full suite of Linux
facilities will have this problem. It just hasn't been done for
a 2.6 kernel just yet.
