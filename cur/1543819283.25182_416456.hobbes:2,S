The patch was badly wordwrapped.  Please fix and resend.
I'd suggest that you enable it on all architectures, not just CONFIG_ARM. 
Tht way we'll at least get compile coverage.
Coding style problems:
- The code uses four-spaces where it should be using hard tabs.  Linux
  style is to always use hard tabs.
- The code does this:
	if(
	while(
  Linux style is
	if (
	while (
- Try to keep everything inside the 80th column.  (This is especially
  useful when sending wordwrapped patches ;))
