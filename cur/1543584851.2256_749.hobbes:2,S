That message is suspicious.  It looks like you have md built into the
kernel but some module has redefined partition_name.  Since the only
code that defines partition_name in 2.4.2 is drivers/md/md.c, it looks
like you managed to build md.o into the kernel and as a module.  Please
double check your config and modules_install.
