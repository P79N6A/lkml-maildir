Sorry, I should have been more clear. I think the signal handler approach
is fine for user processes, I was just wondering why you needed anything
like that for kernel threads..
When a kernel thread is sleeping, I don't see that it has much state at
all: it will be re-started anyway on the next boot, and I don't see it
having any "state".
(I didn't think it through enough - never mind saving the stack page,
because I don't think there is anything at all interesting there to save).
