Poor man way of doing this is just ripping ioctl-related code from usb's devio.c
to separate file, and build this file twice, once for native_ioctl and 64bit
urb structure, and once for compat_ioctl and 32bit urb structure.
I see no reason why it should not work for apps which submit & reap URBs through
32bit or 64bit API exclusively, without mixing them (and when you mix them,
you'll get reasonable error that you did not submit specified URB).
Only problem is that after that USB code "knows" about 32bit API.  But it is
intention of compat_ioctl, no?

P.S.:  When designing new API, please do not make it unnecessary complicated.
USB video needs rather large bandwidth and low latency, so please no ASCII
strings, and scatter-gather aware API helps a bit...
