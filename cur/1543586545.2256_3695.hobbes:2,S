All,
is it possible to detect whether a device is running at 66MHz (as opposed
to 33)?  PCI defines a 66MHz capable bit, but not a 66MHz enabled bit.  We
have a silly device that seems to need to know what it's bus speed is, but
have no way to tell from software (that I know of).
So, pray tell -- is there a way to figure it out?
