   	Dave, you've mentioned doing the equivalent of
   __attribute__((weak,alias("foo")) by hand.  Could you give an example?
#define make_weak(foo,bar)	__asm__(".weak foo, bar")
Or however the assembler syntax works.  GLIBC has some header file it
at least used to use which had macros doing something similar.
