	10x. Here is the case:
I use SMBus block read with scx200_acb as a bus it uses the lenght
which is as i say uninitialized and tries to read a number of random bytes
from the board i use. And it doesn't return the lenght as a first byte,
so the drivers reads until it gets an oops. Which in turn makes me wonder
why with this patch i correcly receive the number of bytes i pass,
looking at the driver i can not see that it gets the lenght from the read data.
I don't know well SMBus/I2C specs but read with buffer and no lenght 
doesn't look sane to me. So how should this be fixed?
