Um, that's a comment.  It's standard C.

Sorry, I assumed you'd've spent some time thinking about the problem.
Here's the problem.  If a file needs canonicalize_irq(), it should
include <linux/interrupt.h> (which eventually ends up including
asm/irq,h), and not <asm/irq.h> (where it's defined).
If a file needs add_wait_queue(), it should include <linux/wait.h>
(where it's defined) and not <linux/fs.h> (which directly includes
linux/wait.h>.
Please define an algorithm which distinguishes the two cases.
