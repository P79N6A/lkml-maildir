Ahhhh, so the kernel is always stored at physical address 0x00000000
onwards, which is constantly mapped in at 0xC0000000 onwards. Therefore you
can get the physical address by lopping of the 0xC, but only on kernel
addresses.
Makes sense.
So presumably the other option is to allocate kernel memory and then pass a
pointer to it back to user space. Is that possible?
