Hi,
I send this to every one who seems to be interested in it as cc.
(If you don't want this simple let me know).
This is the next release off my Kernel Patch letting grub loads 
Kernel-Modules at boot time.
This patch is against Kernel 2.5.1 and grub 0.90 and consider off 3 Parts:
1. mboot.diff: Makes vmlinux multiboot compliant.
   Changes made since last Version:
	1.  added 2 new build targets to the Kernel Makefiles "mImage"
	     and "mImage.gz" creating clean Multiboot Kernel-Images in
	     arch/i386/boot.
	2.  setup.c now evaluates the multiboot apm table correctly.
2. bootmodules.diff: Adds a new elf-object file loader, evaluating and 
   inserting the modules grub have loaded into the Kernel.
   Changes made since last Version:
	1.  Module Parameters are evaluated correctly now.
	2.  Fixed some memory leaks and 1 byte miss bug in boot_modules.c.
	3.  Fixed a ugly bug that made modules exporting much kernel symbols oops at 
	     boott up.
3. grub.diff: This is a new patch adding a command to grub who loads all
 	     modules in a specified file with correct module-dependecies.
	     Now you could do something like:
	     root (hd0,1)
	     kernel /boot/vmlinux-2.5.1prex root=/dev/hda1 ro
	     modulesfromfile /etc/modules /lib/modules/2.5.1/modules.dep
	     inside your grub menu.lst and every thing specified in /etc/module
	     gets loaded before the Kernel is booted.
