Urk, yes, or just those preempted in kernel.  Which looks doable and not
intrusive, modulo my limited scheduler knowledge.  So synchronize_kernel 
isn't dead yet, though it just got a new flesh wound.

Is it?  You must be thinking about much more intensive use of the spinlock as 
with per-op calls as opposed to per-attach (mount).  I'd planned to make the 
spinlocks per-module, but your per-cpu code looks just fine.

To resolve this, start the module in can-increment state, do the module 
initialization, register the notifiers, and finally register the interface.
In other words, the module never needs to be in can't-increment state at 
initialization.  (The module writer must ensure they have the correct, 
raceless initial state of whatever the notifiers are notifying about, which 
strikes me as a little tricky in itself.)

I'll cast my vote for your in-kernel linker, in the mistaken belief that 
democracy has anything to do with the question.  Does this make progress 
towards eliminating one of create_module or init_module?

I'd use this feature in filesystem development, regardless of the risks, 
since I regularly do worse things to the kernel anyway.  But don't you think 
the rmmod parameter should be different for the ask-nicely vs the 
shoot-in-the-head flavor?  How about -f -f or -F for the latter?
