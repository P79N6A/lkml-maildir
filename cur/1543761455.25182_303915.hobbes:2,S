basically for PREEMPT_RT the only constraint is that RCU sections should
be preemptable. Whatever the performance cost. If PREEMPT_RT is merged
into the upstream kernel then it will (at least initially) be at a
status similar to NOMMU: it will be tolerated as long as it causes no
'drag' on the main code. The RCU API variants i introduced clearly
violated this requirement, and were my #1 worry wrt. upstream
mergability.

yeah, agreed - it looks perfect - both the read and write side is
preemptable. Can i just plug the code you sent into rcupudate.c and
expect it to work, or would you like to send a patch? If you prefer you
can make it an unconditional patch against an upstream kernel to keep
things simple for you - i'll then massage it to be properly PREEMPT_RT
dependent.

all RCU-locked sections must be preemptable in -RT.  Basically RCU is a
mainstream API that is used by lots of code and will be introduced in
many other areas as well. From the -RT kernel's POV sees this as an
'uncontrollable latency source', which keeps introducing critical
sections. One major goal of PREEMPT_RT is to convert all popular
critical section APIs into preemptible sections, so that the amount of
code that is non-preemptable is drastically reduced and can be managed
(and thus can be trusted). This goal has a higher priority than any
performance consideration, because it doesnt matter what performance you
have, if you cannot trust the kernel to be deterministic.
