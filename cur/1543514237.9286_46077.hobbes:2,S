It is a bug in minix_new_inode(). However, in case of minixfs lock_super()
is not needed (it can't block, so locking buys nothing here - we hold
the big kernel lock anyway). Looks like unlock_super() is a braino
introduced when somebody did quota support for minixfs (in 2.3.13). It
should be removed.
If your filesystem needs additionl exclusion here - use lock_super().
