The current alloc_percpu() is problematic because it has to allocate 
entries for all cpus even those who are not online yet. There is no way to 
track alloc_percpu entries and therefore no possibility of adding an entry 
for a processor if one comes online or for removing one when a processor 
goes away.
An additional complication is the allocation of per cpu entries for 
processors whose memory node are not online. The current 
implementation will fall back on a unspecific allocation but this means 
that the placement of the per cpu entries will not be on the node of the 
processor!
