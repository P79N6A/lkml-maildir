NetApp 8)
The offloading file system stuff has been proposed and kicked around and
failed repeatedly in different circles. What has had some success is
offloading layout so that the I/O device thinks in terms of
	handle = allocate(blocks, near_this, and_this, ....)
	data = read(handle, offset, len)
	write(handle, offset, len, data)
	free(handle)
type API's, allowing the storage subsystem to do physical
mirror/relocation/HSM in private.
