	It seems that most of the 2.5.X construct are also available
in 2.4.X, but 2.5.X obsolete some of the old 2.4.X construct (for
example pci API).
	For me, the problem between 2.5.X and 2.4.X is the USB API
which has significantely changed (urb_submit anyone ?). I end up
having two quite different version of irda-usb to maintain. But
probably USB in 2.5.X. is too much a moving target for you to include
in your package.

	Actually, NIH works both ways (so don't take personally). It
would be nice to have David Hinds using your package, because you
would immediately gain a sizeable user base, and because a lot of
Pcmcia drivers are both in the kernel and the Pcmcia package, and some
pour souls attempt to keep them in sync.
	For example, we currently have a unsatisfactory situation with
the orinoco and airo drivers.
	By the way, I didn't look in detail at kcompat24, but I
guarantee you that the latest Pcmcia package has quite a complete
solution.
