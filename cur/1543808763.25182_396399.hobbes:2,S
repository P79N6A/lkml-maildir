Yes, something like clear_user_higpage_partial() is definitely needed
for cases like direct-io.c.
We have similar handling for when ptrace() uses get_user_pages() and
tries to write to those pages, via copy_to_user_page() and
copy_from_user_page().  But those interfaces don't clear memory and
they only work in the ptrace path, and they are optimized for that
usage.
