Subject: [PATCH] psmouse: OLPC: fix incorrect validate_byte check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hm, you're right; does this patch fix it?  (Sorry for the top-posting,
folks)
The validate_byte check logic was backwards; it should return true for
an *invalid* packet.  Thanks to Jeremy Katz for spotting this one.
