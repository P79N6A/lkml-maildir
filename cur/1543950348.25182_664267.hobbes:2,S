Subject: [PATCH][BUGFIX][RFC] fix soft lock up at NFS mount by making limitation of dentry_unused
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

[Summary]
  Make a limitation of dentry_unused to avoid soft lock up at NFS mounts
 and remounting any filesystem.
[Descriptions]
- background
 dentry_unused is a list of dentries which is not in use. This works
 as a cache against not-exisiting files. dentry_unused grows up when
 directories or files are removed. This list can be *verrry* long
 if there is no memory  pressure, because there is no limit.
- what's problem
 When prune_dcache() is called, it scans *all* dentry_unused linearly
 under spin_lock(). This scan costs very much if there are many entries.
 For example, prune_dcache() is called at mounting NFS.
 In our test, when there are 100,000,000 of unused dentries, mounting
 NFS took 1 minutes and almost all user programs hang during it.
  100,000,000 is possible number on large systems.
 This problem already happend on our system.
 Therefore, we need a limitation of dentry_unused.
- How to fix
 Limit number of unused dentries to suitable value.
 Threshold is as follows:
 dentry_unused_ratio: default value is 10000(%). If the amount of
 dentry_unused reaches to 10000% of the amount of dentry_in_use,
 5% of them are freed.
 I feel we need more tests to determine resonable value to any system.
 So, please test.
 This patch is based on linux-2.6.25-rc4.
-Test Results
 Result on 24GB boxes with excessive unused dentries.
Without patch:
# cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
103327453       103313783       45      0       0
# time mount -t nfs 192.168.0.2:/export /mnt
real    1m4.698s
user    0m0.000s
sys     1m4.672s
 With this patch:
# cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
118681  117225  45      0       0       0
# time mount -t nfs 192.168.0.2:/export /mnt
real    0m0.103s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.076s
Tested on Intel Itanium 2 9050 (dualcore) x12 MEM 24GB , kernel-2.6.25-rc4
I found no peformance regression in my tests.
