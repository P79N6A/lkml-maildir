No, you don't quite get it.  The above code Nico pasted supports _one_
ARM machine type only (the one I have here, hence why its in my tree)
where the SMC chip is configured to be in 8-bit mode.
We also have the same device connected in 16-bit mode on other machines,
with different ways to set it up:
http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/patches/viewpatch.php?id=734/1
Now imagine the case when you have 100 different machine types, all
different, using this device where each hardware designer has decided to
connect the chip up differently.
Is putting this crud into drivers going to be maintainable?  No.
