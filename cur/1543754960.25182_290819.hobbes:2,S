It makes the situation a whole lot clearer from the point of working
out what is free and what isn't, making it less likely that we'll
trample over some magic port which your VGA card needs.
This, along with throwing in the ports found via ACPI (which Dominik
has hinted) should (maybe that's the wrong word) give us a complete
picture and allow things like PCMCIA to do reliable resource
allocation.  The same goes for Cardbus/PCI as well of course.
Maybe at this point the idea that you need to tell PCMCIA about which
resources it can validly use can finally be eliminated, which is a
big step towards eliminating it's dependence on userspace.
(I hope this is what you were talking about and I haven't just produced
a load of unrelated waffle!)
