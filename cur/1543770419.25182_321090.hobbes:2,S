Andrew: please drop the following two patches:
 sched-remove-set_tsk_need_resched-from-init_idle-v2.patch
 sched-remove-set_tsk_need_resched-from-init_idle-v2-ia64-fix.patch
and add the one below. The only followup patch 
(sched-voluntary-kernel-preemption.patch) should still apply cleanly.  
Nick's upcoming patch can then come afterwards.
----
This patch tweaks idle thread setup semantics a bit: instead of setting
NEED_RESCHED in init_idle(), we do an explicit schedule() before
calling into cpu_idle().
This patch, while having no negative side-effects, enables wider use of 
cond_resched()s.  (which might happen in the stock kernel too, but it's 
particulary important for voluntary-preempt)
