No, I don't consider my data that special - I just say "screw it" and
go looking for the backups.  However, my point is that it's not THAT
hard to salvage data off drives - it's easy enough that companies are
making a living doing it.
The question is regarding sites that are paranoid about shipping out
their data when such recovery is possible.

I didn't say it was impossible - I said you had to use a degausser that
was up to the task.  A degausser that is rated to bulk-erase tape media
is probably *NOT* sufficiently strong to do a multi-platter disk.  Most
tapes need 350 Oe or so to bulk, while disks are in the 1500 Oe range.
And you need a really big-ass magnet to make a 1500 Oe field big enough to
cover an entire disk (especially if it's an older disk of the 5.25 or
even larger variety - older IBM mainframe disks were up to 14" platters).
The Canadian government seems to agree - they recommend either getting the
degaussing wand between the platters (page 10) or using a cavity degausser
(page 12).  Note that they do *not* certify cavity degaussers for disk drives
over 3 1/2" with a coercivity over 1100Oe.
