i'd not mind merging the extra bits to PREEMPT_RT to enable fusyn's, if 
they come in small, clean steps. E.g. Daniel's plist.h stuff was nice 
and clean.

is priority ceiling coming in via some POSIX feature that fusyn's need
to address? What would be needed precisely - a way to set a priority for
a lock (independently of the owner's task priority), and let that
control the PI mechanism?
Unless i'm missing something, this could be implemented by detaching
lock->owner_prio from lock->owner - via e.g. negative values. Thus some
minimal code would check whether we need the owner's priority in the PI
logic, or the semaphore's "own" priority level.
i.e. this doesnt seem to really affect the core design of RT mutexes.
OTOH, deadlock detection is another issue. It's quite expensive and i'm 
not sure we want to make it a runtime thing. But for fusyn's deadlock 
detection and safe teardown on owner-exit is a must-have i suspect?

sure, RT mutexes could be exposed in !PREEMPT_RT.
