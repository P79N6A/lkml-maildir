I agree, but the suspend/resume safeness has to be somehow indicated by
the driver.  We could add a flag for that, but it would require us to modify
lots of existing drivers (unless there's something obvious I don't see).
However, the driver can effectively say "I'm not suspend/resume-safe" by
returning an error from .suspend(), in which case the system will automatically
refuse to suspend.
