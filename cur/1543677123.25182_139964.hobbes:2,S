Sure we do. We do have backwards list traversal, but it's already not 
available for the RCU case (ie we have "list_for_each_entry_rcu()", but we 
don't have "list_for_each_entry_reverse_rcu()").
Of course, somebody may be using the non-RCU versions of the list 
traversal macros on a RCU list, but that would be a bug anyway.
