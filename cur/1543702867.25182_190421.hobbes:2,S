How are the WRITEs grouped, are they grouped together or do they seem to 
occur more evenly spaced? When you use "sync", how long until the next 
WRITE? What are the values of /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs and 
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs? Are you sure you are running a 
kernel that supports the commit= option with reiserfs? (This option was 
added in 2.6.1.)
I've never tested laptop mode with reiserfs BTW, does anybody else here 
have experience with laptop mode and reiserfs?
