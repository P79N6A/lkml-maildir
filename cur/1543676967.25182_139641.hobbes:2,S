I tried a few variations of this yesterday and they all led to horrible
latencies, but I couldn't really explain why.  I had a bunch of other
stuff in at the time to try and improve throughput though, so I'll try
it again.
I think part of the problem is the cascading wakeups from
get_request_wait_wakeup().  So if we wakeup 32 procs they in turn wakeup
another 32, etc.
