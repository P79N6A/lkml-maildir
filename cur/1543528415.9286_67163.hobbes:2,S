I see this regularly as well...

I haven't tried tcpdump on it yet, but will next time it happens.
However, as the problem usually occurs during NFS installs of
RedHat Linux on a customer's machine (temporarily taking my
network up to five machines), and there is NO other network
activity at that time, I would have to assume this is not the
case until proven otherwise...

The network in question consists of four PC's on a 10baseT
network, one being a dedicated print server and another a
dedicated modem server and firewall, neither of which generate
much in the way of traffic. Those two are at opposite ends of the
net segment, with the total length being about 10 metres, so
there shouldn't be any length related problems either.

By a process of elimination, this has to be the most likely
cause...
Best wishes from Riley.
