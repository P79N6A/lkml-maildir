Dave,
If someone committs a crime in the US, and you don't report it, you have
also just committed another one by failing to report it (like if you
witness a murder, and turn and walk away).  Some of us (not you) are
designated as "officers of the court" and have a legal obligtion to do
so.  I am not the damaged party, so I should not, but interfereing with
email routing is a serious crime in the US, BTW.  
I am speaking from my duties and perpective and not yours.  I have an
obligation to if I 
am a party directly affected.    
:-)
