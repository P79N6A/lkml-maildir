Subject: [ANNOUNCE] udev 014 release
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've released the 014 version of udev.  It can be found at:
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-014.tar.gz
rpms built against Red Hat FC1 are available at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-014-1.i386.rpm
with the source rpm at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-014-1.src.rpm
udev allows users to have a dynamic /dev and provides the ability to
have persistent device names.  It uses sysfs and /sbin/hotplug and runs
entirely in userspace.  It requires a 2.6 kernel with CONFIG_HOTPLUG
enabled to run.  Please see the udev FAQ for any questions about it:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
For any udev vs devfs questions anyone might have, please see:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs
Major changes from the 013 version:
	- speed!  This version is _much_ faster than the 013 release.
	  Thanks to Ananth Narayan for the libsysfs changes (and udev
	  patch) that enabled this.
	- there's a new program called udevinfo in the extras/ directory
	  that helps in determining the sysfs information for a specific
	  device.  This is useful in writing new udev rules.
	- the %D modifier is now gone.  People who were using it to
	  provide a devfs naming scheme will need to rewrite their rules
	  (look at the examples on the linux-hotplug-devel mailing list
	  for more details.)
	- lots of little changes and bug fixes.
Thanks again to everyone who has send me patches for this release, a
full list of everyone, and their changes is below.
udev development is done in a BitKeeper repository located at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/udev
Daily snapshots of udev from the BitKeeper tree can be found at:

If anyone ever wants a tarball of the current bk tree, just email me.
thanks,
