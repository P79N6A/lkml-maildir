Not rally. 
You probably don't realize just how much the acpid thing does: it parses
the ACPI AML language etc - all quite complex, and all something that I do
not want to do in the kernel due to that complexity.
Maybe there should be some more generic interfaces (ie a generic interface
to user mode to inform people about suspend/resume), but I do not think
there should be complete unification..
