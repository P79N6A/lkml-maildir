But we don't really need further kernel support for that, do we?
I know a user currently cannot raise priority, but the user can
run all his normal apps at slightly lower priority, except for xine.
And the admin/distrubutor can set everything up for using the slightly
lower priority by default.  Well, perhaps all this involves so
much use of "nice" that kernel support is a good idea anyway...
