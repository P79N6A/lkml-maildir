Bit by bit, either parts of Keith's work, or orthogonal ideas
are making it in. Whether the big chunks make it by halloween remains
to be seen.

All are aiming for halloween, but none (afaik) have put forward
anything that can be merged yet. The XFS & LVM folks are still
cleaning bits and getting things presentable, whilst Ben is still
at work with aio I guess (judging by his relative silence since
the summit 8-)

This has been around for an age, but I haven't seen anything for 2.5
yet. Then again, I dropped off the packet-writing mailing list a long
time ago, so I'm not sure how up to date those folks are.

Davem's call I guess. ISTR the USAGI work was a rather large patch which
if in Davem's shoes, I'd be rather dubious about taking 'all-in-one'.

Last I saw of this patch it was still against something like 2.4.1,
so they have a lot of catch up to do. This fact asides, if it doesn't
touch common code, there's no reason it can't go in post-feature freeze
in the same way as a driver/additional fs. Depends how much it touches.
That said, are there really that many NFSv4 hosts out there that make
this a *must have* feature ? Are any other *nix vendors shipping NFSv4 yet?

Agreed, a pretty important feature.

"works for me". Admittedly I've not played with pcmcia much, but it
seems at least if you choose the right hardware it works fine.

ObRelated: There was some shouting about a sysctlfs at some point
which could clean up a lot of the crap in /proc/sys at the expense of
an extra mount. Al ?
