I don't know if it's a reasonable expectation; that's why I'm asking.
I could live with having to export everything to patches; it's not so
hard. It's just that if the export to whatever ends up replacing BK can
be done in a way (or at a time) which allows the existing forest of BK
trees to be pulled from one last time, that may save a fair amount of
work all round, so I thought it was worth mentioning.
