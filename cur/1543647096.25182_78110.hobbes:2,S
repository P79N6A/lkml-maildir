The registration API is also used for the ACL routines.  That's why
it's there.
That being said, I'm not at all convinced that allowing things like
the EA routines and the ACL routines to be separate modules is a good
idea.  Life would be much simpler if everything was compiled into a
single ext3 subsystem, and we eliminate all of the extra overhead of
having separate modules for specific filesystem features.  Certainly
the XFS and JFS folks didn't go down this path.
(That's why I took out to the questions in Config.in; I really felt
that it was wrong.  I however didn't want to go as far as to remove
the #ifdef's and removing the registration API's without at least
having some discussion on the topic.)
