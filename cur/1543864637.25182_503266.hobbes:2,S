Subject: [PATCH] revert changes to pipefs for i_ino uniqueness
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Since posting that patch to add i_ino uniqueness to pipefs, I've gotten some
comments that have convinced me that we should probably leave it as is for
now (at least until someone we a good reason).
So, please back out that patch from -mm.
The patch below should revert pipefs to its original state.
Thanks,
