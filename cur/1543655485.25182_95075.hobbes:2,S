There is a simpler way to solve the nanosleep problem which doesn't
involve any more restart magic than we have been using for years.
That is to define a new sys_new_nanosleep system call which takes one
argument which is a pointer to the time to sleep.  If the sleep gets
interrupted by a pending signal, the kernel sys_new_nanosleep will
write back the remaining time (overwriting the requested time) and
return -ERESTARTNOHAND.  The glibc nanosleep() then looks like this:
int nanosleep(const struct timespec *req, struct timespec *rem)
{
	*rem = *req;
	return new_nanosleep(rem);
}
Any reason why this can't work?
(BTW this is Rusty's idea. :)
Regards,
Paul.
