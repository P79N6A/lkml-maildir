Has anyone performed any benchmarks with:
No SMP w/HT?
SMP w/HT?
SMP + SMT w/HT?
[ ] Symmetric multi-processing support
[ ]   SMT (Hyperthreading) scheduler support
   x SMT scheduler support improves the CPU scheduler's decision making
   x when dealing with Intel Pentium 4 chips with HyperThreading at a
   x cost of slightly increased overhead in some places. If unsure say
   x N here.
I'm tempted to try SMT and benchmark these sometime but I am asking the 
list if anyone has already done this first.
Question: "slightly increased overhead in some places."
What type of workloads would exhibit such overhead?
Would this option (SMT) be recommended for a desktop or server machine?
Are there any white papers or documentation I can read about this option?
Thanks.
