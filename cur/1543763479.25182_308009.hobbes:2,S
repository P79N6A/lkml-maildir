Blocks are limited in size by 64K, true. But why it matters for us? 
Suppose we compress 1 GiB of input, and have a 70K output buffer. We 
reserve 5 bytes at the end and start calling zlib_deflate(stream, 
Z_SYNCK_FLUSH) recurrently. It puts one 64K block, puts its end marker, 
then puts a part of a second block. Then we call zlib_deflate(strem, 
Z_FINISH) and it puts the end marker of the second block and the adler32 
checksum of the entire stream. So I don't see any problem albeit I didn't 
try yet :-) But I'll do.

Surely I'll check. I'll even test the new implementation (which I didn't 
actually do) with a large input before sending it next time.
