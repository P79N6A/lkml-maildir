Adding this macro doesn't give us anything that simply saying
"__attribute__((unused))" doesn't give.  But it does add a layer of
kernel-specific indirection.
If we're going to get kernel-specific, I'd prefer to see:
__needed: suppress warning and don't discard,
__unneeded: suppress warning and might discard.
For me this fits better with how I think.
Rusty.
