No, it's just one of the quads.  Whereas the worst affected (laptop)
is a duo.  I should probably be worrying more about that one: it may
be that I'm thrashing it and its results are meaningless, though still
curious that slab and slqb and slob all do so markedly better on it.
It's behaving much better with slub_max_order=1 slub_min_objects=4,
but to get competitive I've had to switch off most of the debugging
options I usually have on that one - and I've not yet tried slab,
slqb and slob with those off too.  Hmm, it looks like its getting
progressively slower.
I'll continue to investigate at leisure,
but can't give it too much attention.
