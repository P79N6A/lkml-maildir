Sometime, please consider killing MLFu64 and friends.
#if (BITS_PER_LONG == 32) || defined(CONFIG_X86_64) || (defined(CONFIG_UML_X86) && defined(CONFIG_64BIT))
#define MLFi64 "lld"
#define MLFu64 "llu"

You covered most cases there, but sh64 implements u64 as `unsigned long
long' (for example).
Generally we solve this problem by just using %ll and casting the args
appropriately.   That does have some runtime cost on 32-bit.
u64 and s64 are the easy case - it gets stickier on things like sector_t
whose size is controlled by a CONFIG_thing on 32-bit.
