The best numbers have to be determined, it requires extensive profiling runs.
Also the most heavy users are probably better converted to direct calls
of kmem_cache_alloc (looking at my /proc/slabinfo there must be some heavy
user who doesn't do that for a size <=32bytes)

1500bytes slab unfortunately is not too useful, because it does not fit well
in 4K pages (you would need 8K or 16K page allocations, which the mm system
does not like much due to fragmentation) 
I guess the best optimization for alloc_skb would be a binary search.
