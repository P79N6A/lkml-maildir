Subject: a52b1752c07 broke !SMP: error: implicit declaration of function `WARN_ON'

Hello,
kernel/timer.c (and some others as arch/arm/kernel/irq.c) include
<linux/smp.h>, but not <linux/kernel.h>
a52b1752c07 introduces usage of the WARN_ON macro in <linux/smp.h>, but
doesn't pull in <linux/kernel.h>.  (<asm/bug.h> is not enough, at least
for arm, because WARN_ON uses printk there.)
The obvious options are:
1) include <linux/kernel.h> in <linux/smp.h>, maybe conditioned by !SMP
2) include <linux/kernel.h> in all includers of <linux/smp.h>
3) remove the WARN_ONs introduced by a52b1752c07.
WARN_ON is used in an inline function that isn't used in every file
including <linux/smp.h>, so maybe updating the compiler might make
the effort for 2) smaller!?  (I'm using gcc 3.4.4)
Best regards
Uwe
