    Interesting, that about extended partitions. Anyway, I need them, cos I
    got DOS, linux and netbsd on my disk, and I can't squeeze all of them into
    the four primary partitions.
    Are you saying that though fdisk says /dev/hda5 starts at the same cylinder
    as my original /dev/hda6 started, it might actually be different at the
    sector level? (my disk is LBA, of course)
I missed the start of this discussion and don't know
what you are talking about. But yes, logical partitions
do not usually start at a cylinder boundary, so if you
mess around with partitions you have to make sure that
everything is OK on the sector level.
You can see sector details using the "cfdisk -Ps /dev/hda" command.
It will tell you the offset in the extended partition where the
logical partition starts.
On the other hand, if I am not mistaken Ted was talking about
something else, namely the fact that logical partitions do not
have an absolute address, but a relative address w.r.t. to previous
logical partition. Thus, if you delete the previous one by hand
you are asking for trouble.
The command "cfdisk -Pt /dev/hda" will show such details.
