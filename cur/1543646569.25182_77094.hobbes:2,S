(this is why i said 'also' in the above sentence. It would be in addition
to the existing (and sensible) requirement for BM to be able to republish
the commit logs.)

with the difference that the changelog was a few orders of magnitude less
of an infrastructure element. Plus if you read those changelogs you'll see
that it's 100% written by Alan or Linus - in 99% of the cases it just
describes what the patch does, and in the remaining 1% it quotes a few key
sentences that can be considered fair use. Ie. the ChangeLog was owned by
Alan and Linus. [it would be a bit more robust if the ChangeLogs would be
part of the kernel repository, that would make them covered by the GPL.]

yes, as long as the documentation comes with the patch and is part of the
kernel tree, which the patch derives, and which kernel tree has a certain
'COPYING' file in the top directory. Patches *are* actively monitored for
conflicting licenses in individual files, and occasionally we had to
remove files.

it *is* a BK problem caused by BK becase now this whole can of worms got
silently exported to the kernel tree, and while BM itself is safe via its
license, the kernel tree 'as a whole' is exposed.
until now the Linux kernel tree was distributed in a tarball that had a
nice COPYING file in a very prominent spot. With BK the situation is
different - and like i said in previous mails it's not BK's "fault", but
BK's "effect" - and it's a situation that needs to be remedied, right?
