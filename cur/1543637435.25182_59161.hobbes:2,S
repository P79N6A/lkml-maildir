It's even for DMA a good thing, since the IRQ handler in question can
reenter the RQ handler. The invention of the not unmasking
behaviour in Linux is the result of some not entierly ATA-2 compliant
devices long long time ago gone. Basically XT disks on PC. They did have 
the habbit of splewing IRQs too early for command ACK.
