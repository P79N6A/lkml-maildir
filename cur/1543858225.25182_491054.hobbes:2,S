Subject: [PATCH 2/12] tty: Clarify disassociate_ctty
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/13/60

The code to look at tty_old_pgrp and send SIGHUP and SIGCONT
when it is present only executes when disassociate_ctty is
called from do_exit.  Make this clear by adding an explict
on_exit check, and explicitly setting tty_old_pgrp to 0.
In addition fix the locking by reading tty_old_pgrp under
the siglock.
