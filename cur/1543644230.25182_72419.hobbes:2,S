Subject: 2.5.37 won't run X?

X won't start on 2.5.37, but works with 2.5.36
The screen goes black as usual, but then nothing else happens.
ssh'ing in from another machine shows XFree86 using 50% cpu,
i.e. one of the two cpu's in this machine.
killing the XFre86 process is impossible, even with kill -9
from root. sysrq SAK worked though, so I could recover
the machine.  But I had to boot a different kernel to run X.
