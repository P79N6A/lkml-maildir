Changes to the kernel over the last few versions have exposed some weaknesses 
and quirks in the interactivity estimator. The following 5 patches are aimed 
at addressing these issues. Each changes one unique aspect of the 
interactivity estimator thus allowing easy comparison if desired.
For those who wish to try them I've placed a simple rolled up patch for 
download to apply to 2.6.15 here:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/interactivity/2.6.15-O22int.patch
The separate patches are in that directory as well and will follow this email.
Andrew please apply the following 5 patches to -mm for testing.
Cheers,
Con
