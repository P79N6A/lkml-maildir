Starting today, Paul Mackerras (paulus@samba.org) is taking over as
maintainer of the Linux/PPC 32-bit tree and will continue as the Linux/PPC
64-bit tree maintainer.
The stable and development trees (2.2 and 2.4) will be moving away from
the FSMLabs ftp/rsync/BitKeeper repository to the vger.kernel.org CVS
tree.  Changes should continue to flow into the main tree available from
kernel.org.
