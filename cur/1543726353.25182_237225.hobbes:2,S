The following issue comes from Linus' tree:
JFFS2_COMPRESSION_OPTIONS is asked even if JFFS2_FS support isn't 
selected.
The patch below adds a dependency on JFFS2_FS to 
JFFS2_COMPRESSION_OPTIONS.
I've also added a dependency on EXPERIMENTAL which seemed to be logical 
after reading the description of this option (but even if you disagree 
with this, please add the dependency on JFFS2_FS).

 	  Enabling this option allows you to explicitly choose which
 	  compression modules, if any, are enabled in JFFS2. Removing
 	  compressors and mean you cannot read existing file systems,
 	  and enabling experimental compressors can mean that you
 	  write a file system which cannot be read by a standard kernel.
 
 	  If unsure, you should _definitely_ say 'N'.
