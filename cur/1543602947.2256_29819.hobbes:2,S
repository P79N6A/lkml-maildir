I am using it and I am using gcc 2.95.3 for normal things,
and to compiled my kernel and my libc, because gcc
3.0.1 produces slower binaries on my Athlons (yes, with athlon
optimizzations turned on), at less for my programs, and it is better to
avoid it for glibc compilation because of back compatibility issues.
