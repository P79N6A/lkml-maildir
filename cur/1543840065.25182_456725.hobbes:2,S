No default y please unless the kernel doesn't boot without it.

No default m please.  If someone just presses return in make oldconfig
with a new kernel they don't want all kinds of new random optional drivers.
I think I would prefer to call it _K8, because in theory new AMD CPUs
might have difference performance counters.

I would drop the if unsure ... too

Does that include the Core 2 support that you had in the i386 patch? 
In general I would prefer to call it P4, not EM64T which is just
a generic architecture name and at least on P4 performance counters
are not really architected yet.

Doing the checks the other way round would be more logical.

Why not anyways? The registers are basically the same. What's so different
in 64bit? oprofile shares that code too.
The file seems a bit underdocumented. At least some brief description
what PEBS is and maybe at least one sentence for each function?

What does it need the UUID for?

I hope you double checked the alignment comes up everywhere correctly.
u64 alignment is different on the 32bit and 64bit ABIs. That can screw
Normally it's safer to use aligned_u64 on files that can be used on 
32bit too, because that avoids that problem.
Where is the actual code that implements the code that you hooked 
into arch/x86_64/*? I must have missed that.
