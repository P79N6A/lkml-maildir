Look back in the thread. It made kernel compiles about 5% faster on a
fairly large box. I think the SGI people did it originally because it
caused them even larger problems.
I'm not saying their aren't arguments on both sides ... there are. I just
agree with you there's a lot of hand-waving going on ... but probably not
agreeing as to who it's coming from ;-)
Some sort of comprimise has to be struck for now, until we get sub-HZ
timers. I'd prefer 100, personally (I had that set as default in my tree
for a long time). Some people would prefer 1000 or even more, maybe.
250/300 seems like a reasonable comprimise to me. Exactly what problems
*does* it cause (in visible effect, not "timers are less granular").
Jittery audio/video? How much worse is it?
