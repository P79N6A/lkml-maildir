Last I heard, Linus was still thinking about devfs and was leaning
slightly towards it. But that was sometime last year. I've not heard
from him since.

The intent with devfs is to append "s#" for BSD slice numbers to solve
this problem. The normal (primary&extended) partitions use "p#" (with
the existing partition number scheme). So in the end, you could have
"c#b#t#u#p#s#".
I've not got BSD slices on my system, so I don't know what actually
happens: it's been a long time since I looked at that part of the
code.
