Thank you, Ken :)
Excellent work, everything runs as expected.
Starting compilation of 2.6.22-rc2 I get the following nasty messages:
scripts/kconfig/conf -s arch/i386/Kconfig
drivers/macintosh/Kconfig:116:warning: 'select' used by config 
symbol 'PMAC_APM_EMU' refers to undefined symbol 'SYS_SUPPORTS_APM_EMULATION'
drivers/net/Kconfig:2283:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'UCC_GETH' 
refers to undefined symbol 'UCC_FAST'
drivers/input/keyboard/Kconfig:170:warning: 'select' used by config 
symbol 'KEYBOARD_ATARI' refers to undefined symbol 'ATARI_KBD_CORE'
drivers/input/mouse/Kconfig:182:warning: 'select' used by config 
symbol 'MOUSE_ATARI' refers to undefined symbol 'ATARI_KBD_CORE'
But, please note, that has nothing to do with the loop issue, which is solved 
with this patch.
Other sidenote:
I meanwhile tried to find out why my AMD K7 machine oopses with 2.6.21.1.
I first suspected sis5513 ide module, reverted all its dependencies, even 
changed a Makefile, but the Oops is still there after 10 modules reverted. I 
am standing in the dark, although I really would like to help to close down 
2.6.21.x "cleanly".
On Intel P 4 machines this Oops does not happen at all, only on the AMD K7 
machine.
Already planned to start a new thread but instead of wild guessing around I do 
not have any idea wht the reason for the kernel Oops could be.
Best Regards and Thanks
Uwe
