Those of us that do embedded stuff want the option of turning off /proc,
because it is big and fat.  Turning off /proc has not been an option till now,
because so many important pieces of imformation could previosly only be
obtained by reading /proc.  If I have the ability to turn off /proc for my
applications and instead use /dev/ps, then good for me.  You still have the
ability to turn off /dev/ps and use /proc.  
Nobody loses,
