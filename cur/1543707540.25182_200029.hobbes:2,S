Yup! Reapplying 3c9x-enable_wol.patch and supplying "enable_wol=1" to
3c95x.ko seems to solve the problem. It seems that 3c59x power
management is only enable if wake-on-LAN is enabled... why?
Now, dual booting between vanilla and -mm kernels causes problems when
loading the module since vanilla doesn't yet recognize "enable_wol", but
this is only a minor problem.
Thanks!
