The kernel code is broken.  Circular dependencies make no sense, the
pppoe maintainer agrees and I thought that bug was fixed.

Circular dependencies are not supported, nor are they correrctly
detected.  The existing code to walk the inter module relationships,
including dependencies, alias, probe, probeall, before and after
statements is a mess.  It just grew over the years with special cases
being added and is not robust.
In modutils 2.5 the entire code will be discarded and replaced with a
standard graph walking algorithm with loop detection and back tracking
instead of special case code.  That might change some modutils
behaviour in rare cases and I do not want to change its behaviour just
before kernel 2.4 is released.  I have a list of changes that might
break backwards compatibility waiting for modutils 2.5, this is just
one of them.
