No, I'm not that saying that it's impossible. It's just that's going
to be hell to write and maintain since you have deal with jitter across
various domains that influence each other. It's not unlike the "avoid
priority inversion by never letting threads of different priority lock
against each other" argument. It needs to be seperated. But this is an
issue for a single image system as well.
When I think about it in terms of dual kernel primitives, I really have
difficulty thinking about how to use the message queue stuff to integrate
all of the systems involved in particular with shared buffers. Proper
locking in those cases is scary to me for both methods, but at least
the single kernel image stuff uses familiar chunks of memory that I can
manipulate. I'm open to be proven wrong about this point if you have a
good example sources to show me. I really am.
