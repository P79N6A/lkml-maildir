Yes, all this turning on and off of interrupts does have a
significant cost here.
With the full patchset applied, most of the hot path statistics
get put under areas that already require interrupts to be off,
however there are still a few I didn't get around to doing.
zone_statistics on CONFIG_NUMA, for example.
I wonder if local_t is still good on architectures like ppc64
where it still requires an ll/sc sequence?
