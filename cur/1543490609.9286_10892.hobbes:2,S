Not an option...
This is for my PC at work, and I can't change the NIS server
here. I'm not the sysadmin, and nothing special will be
done for Linux only. The HP/UX and Solaris systems work
fine. The company's IT guys realy don't know about my Linux
box. The local syadmin doesn't object but can't do anything
special for the 3-4 linux systems here.
