Yes, and how is the 3rd party module going to find out if it has
to define -DMODVERSIONS and all the other options? It isn't.
There will always be some user intervention required.
I've also written some add-on kernel modules. They always come
with a clear README and a Makefile that looks like:
KERNELSRC = /usr/src/linux-2.2.12-pre8
CPU=-m486 -DCPU=486
VER=-DMODVERSIONS
OPTFLAGS  = -malign-loops=0 -malign-jumps=0 -malign-functions=2 $(CPU)
WARNFLAGS = -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-parentheses
CFLAGS    = $(WARNFLAGS) -O2 -I$(KERNELSRC)/include $(OPTFLAGS)
The first 3 variables _have_ to be filled in by the user.
Mike.
