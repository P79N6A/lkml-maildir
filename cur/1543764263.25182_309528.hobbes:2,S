Now that would be impressive.
No, I mean this:
 % bzcat ../linux.pkg/patch-2.5.14.bz2| patch -p1 
 % time bzr add -v .   
 (find any new non-ignored files; deleted files automatically noticed) 
 6.06s user 0.41s system 89% cpu 7.248 total
 % time bzr commit -v -m 'import 2.5.14'
 7.71s user 0.71s system 65% cpu 12.893 total
(OK, a bit slower in this case but it wasn't all in core.)
This is only v0.0.3, but I think the interface simplicity and speed
compares well.
I haven't tested importing all 60,000+ changesets of the current bk tree,
partly because I don't *have* all those changesets.  (Larry said
previously that someone (not me) tried to pull all of them using bkclient,
and he considered this abuse and blacklisted them.)
I have been testing pulling in release and rc patches, and it scales to
that level.  It probably could not handle 60,000 changesets yet, but there
is a plan to get there.  In the interim, although it cannot handle the
whole history forever it can handle large trees with moderate numbers of
commits -- perhaps as many as you might deal with in developing a feature
over a course of a few months.
The most sensible place to try out bzr, if people want to, is as a way to
keep your own revisions before mailing a patch to linus or the subsystem
maintainer.
