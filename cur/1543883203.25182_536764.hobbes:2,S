when you are doing a suspend-to-disk I disagree with you. whoever is doing the 
suspend knows what is going on, and they can decide what needs to be done.
the only case where you have 'unexpected' work being thrown away is if you are 
suspending a network server, and the process of suspending it is going to cut 
all the network connections anyway so it's not a seamless process. In this case 
it's fair to let the sysadmin choose between loosing some logs or doing some 
other step to prevent this from happening (which could be to shutdown the 
network service, or load a iptables rule to block the service)
however, most of the uses of suspend-to-disk are going to be single-user 
machines and in that case telling the user that anything that they do after 
issuing the suspend is going to be lost is a perfectly sane thing to do.
and for that matter, if the snapshot is cheap enough, some people may choose to 
cron the snapshot portion of a suspend-to-disk evvery few min as a safety net 
for something going wrong. In this case they really do want all of userspace to 
keep working after the snapshot.
