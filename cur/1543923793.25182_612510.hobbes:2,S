BTW. this has come up for me before, and I have found it useful on
a number of occasions to print the stack of running tasks when they
are looping in the kernel...
Any reason we can't do this?

Sysrq+T fails to show the stack trace of a running task. Presumably this
is to avoid a garbled stack, however it can often be useful, and besides
there is no guarantee that the task won't start running in the middle of
show_stack(). If there are any correctness issues, then the archietcture
would have to take further steps to ensure the task is not running.
