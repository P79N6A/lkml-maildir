Hello, Ingo,
Does the following help with the SMP problem?  This fix and the earlier
one make my old patch survive a few rounds of kernbench on a 4-CPU x86
box.  (Yes, I am still being cowardly!  But happy that the test system
is alive again!)  Without these fixes, it too dies during boot.
							Thanx, Paul
