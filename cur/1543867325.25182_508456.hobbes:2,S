Yes, of course we have to support the indirection, otherwise chaining

I really think it simplifies it. You simply *copy* the parameter (I'd say 
that 70+% of cases falls inside here), and if the current "pmap" bit is 
set, then you do all the indirection copy-from-userspace stuff.
It also simplify userspace a lot, since you can now pass arrays and 
structure pointers directly, w/out saving them in a temporary variable.

That makes also for a hell ugly retrieval API IMO ;)
If it'd be backed up but considerable performance gains, then it might be OK.
But I believe it won't be the case, and that leave us with an ugly API.
OTOH, if noone else object this, it means that I'm the only wierdo :) and 
the API is just fine.
