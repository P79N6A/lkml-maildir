I don't remember exactly, it's been a while, but I think it was not
sufficient when I came up with this change. I can look at it in a few
hours.
The GCC manual is not really precise here:

So 'memory' alone won't probably do the trick, as caching is not the
problem here, but the unknown storage size of the semaphore. 
Perhaps the __voaltile__ will help, but I don't know. 
What are the reasons against mentioning sem->count directly as a "=m" 
reference? This makes the whole thing less fragile and no more dependent
on the memory layout of the structure.
Greetings,
Andreas
