Subject: 2.4: Any plans for new bootmem and waitq patches?

Hello,
I did some tests with bootmem-2.4.17-pre6 and waitq-2.4.17-mainline-1 (don't 
know who wrote it in the first place) on top of 2.4.17-preX with good 
results.
Are there any plans to get this into 2.4 mainline?
Thanks,
	Dieter
BTW waitq-2.4.17-mainline-1 do not apply to latest kernel versions.
