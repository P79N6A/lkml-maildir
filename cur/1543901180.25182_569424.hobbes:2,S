Simple question:  where is a reference -held-, when the PCI device is in 
use?
If you cannot show this, your patch is provably wrong.  And I did not 
see a reference kept in any of your patches.
If you can show me where a reference is stored, I rescind my NAK. 
Otherwise, the patches are demonstrably, provably incorrect.
ACKs cannot get around the -facts-.
