Andrea, these comments are getting pretty tiresome and are not very
constructive. If you want to go off on a tirade, be my guest, but I'm
not listening then.

Again, way overboard silly. You could see reads fill the entire queue
know (since it's sized ridicolously low, something like 35-40ms streamed
io on a modern _ATA_ disk). It's just not very likely, and I'd be very
surprised if it is happening in the contest run. You can see the
workloads making fine progress and iterations, while the score is better
too.
I agree that we don't _want_ to make this be a possibility in the 2.4.22
kernel, but (again) this is a _first version_ designed to show how far
we can take it.
