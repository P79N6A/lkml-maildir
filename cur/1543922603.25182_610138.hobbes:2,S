No. A *working*compiler* is better than broken code.
There's no way to use volatile for these things, since it can hit 
*anything*. When the compiler generates buggy code, it's buggy code. We 
can't add volatiles to every single data structure. We'd be better off 
having a million monkeys on crack try to hand-assemble the thing, than 
having a totally buggy compiler do it for us.
