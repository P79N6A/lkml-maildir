You can find the vfsv0 quota patches for 2.4.18 and 2.4.19
at 
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/
The 2.4.18 patch is from .cz (a while ago), and the 2.4.19 is a diff I
took after applying and very little merging (IIRC) from the 2.4.18 patch
to the base 2.4.19 kernel.
I have done some prelim. testing it the 2.4.19 patch does seem to work fine.
