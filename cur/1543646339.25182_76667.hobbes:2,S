hi ya
mroe fun stuff
"drop tests" ... that person that tend to have "accidents" should be
kept outof the lab and away from hardware
	( ceo/cfo/managers dont wanna spend un-necessary $2K - $10k
	( because somebody dropped it ... or dropped a screw in a running
	( system
on the other hand... that clumbsy tech/engineer is purrfect ina
testing lab or qa lab where they do require drop tests for "submarine"
applications
have fun
alvin
- i never dropped a disks in 20 years... or mb or anything
  importnat/expensive
- dropped lots of screws, screwdrivers into "turned off systems" while
  working on it
- dropped tape drives too and sometimes the tape drives itself ejects the
  tapes too too fast
	- clumbsy me for not being able to catch the 'flying tape" as
	it ejects
- a months worth of daily tapes ( we keep 30 days worth of tape )
	takes up as much room as a 1U box.. 
	-  a 1U box can hold about 3 months worth of compressed data
	in our environment ... ( 3:1 compression on the average )
