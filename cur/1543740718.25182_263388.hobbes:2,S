The name of "overcommit" is definitely misleading.  It means the
opposite.  Since physical hugetlb backing page pool is fixed and
controlled by sys admin, the fault handler can not allocate free
pages when hugetlb page pool exhaust because of user over commits
hugetlb page.  Thus we enforce strict accounting upfront to
guarantee that there will be hugetlb page available at fault time.
The down side of not having it is we SIGBUS if the kernel doesn't
have any free hugetlb pages left.
