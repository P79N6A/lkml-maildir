I don't think so.  The only place were IO actively interferes with
the VM is of the 'write this out when memory gets low' type thing,
and you don't really want this outside filesystems/blockdevices.
There are some VM tricks that are usefull for IO (COW, map_user_kiobuf),
but these operate always on pages (maybe containered by kiobufs, but that
should be of minor interest for the VM).
