Yes.  It particularly sucks on the "maintainerless" core code which is always
in flux.  This is also why I generally reject whitespace-cleanup patches,
and originally rejected the "doesnt" patches (I got convinced by the pedants).
OTOH, 90% of kernel code is copied from elsewhere, so janitorial cleanups
*are* worthwhile, as long as they are one-liners, or fix a real problem.
