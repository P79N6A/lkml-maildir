	What does linking have to do with anything? Where not asking whether this
file *must* be shipped under the GPL. We're asking, given that is has been
placed under the GPL, what does the GPL require.
	As for "another processor", another from what processor? There is just this
one file. We have here a file that is allegedly distributed under the terms
of the GPL. It is, however, obfuscated and not the preferred form for making
modifications.
