You mean xsane, or any other stuff that uses original SANE backends,
Epkowa's iscan doesn't appear to work yet (but seems to require the
scanner module still), see sane-devel archives:
http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/sane-devel/2003-December/009803.html
JFTR, my /etc/sane.d/epson.conf (SANE 1.0.10 here) now has:
# /etc/sane.d/epson.conf
# I personally don't need this:
scsi EPSON
# adjust the hex numbers to vendor and product as printed
# by sane-find-scanner, this is for instance an Epson Perfection 1650:
usb libusb
usb 0x04b8 0x0110
KHK's "epson" backend seems to work fine though. scanimage -L, xsane.
