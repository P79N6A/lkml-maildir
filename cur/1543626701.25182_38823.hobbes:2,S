This is a bug I fixed in the -rest patch, that's also broken on numa.
The deadlock cannot happen if you apply all my patches.
As for your patch it reintroduces a deadlock by looping in GFP relying
on the oom killer (that will also go and kill the
bigger task most of the time), the oom killer can select a task in D
state, or it can a sigterm, and secondly you broke google DB (the right
fix for that min thing are the point-of-view watermarks in the -rest
patch in my collection). the worst thing is that with the oom killer
we've to keep looping, so if the task is for whatever reason hung in R
state in kernel the machine will deadlock, while current way it will
make progress either in the do_exit, or in the -ENOMEM fail path (modulo
getblk that's not too bad anyways). the current memory balancing is now
been good enough to kill in function of probability, so I didn't feel
the need of risking (at the very least theorical) deadlocks there, this
is why I left it disabled.
