A moment ago I have made available on ftp.XX.kernel.org
under linux/kernel/people/aeb/sddr09.c a new SDDR-09 driver,
namely one that not only reads but also writes.
It works for me.
Will submit some version for inclusion in 2.5 next week
or so. Feedback is welcome.

[On the site mentioned one finds sddr09.c and sddr09.h.
Now that I think about it, there are a few other small
changes nearby:
diff -r /linux/2.5/linux-2.5.8/linux/drivers/usb/storage/initializers.h ./initializers.h
39a40
> #include <linux/config.h>
44a46,49
> 
> #ifdef CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_SDDR09
> int sddr09_init(struct us_data *us);
> #endif
diff -r /linux/2.5/linux-2.5.8/linux/drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h ./unusual_devs.h
