yep, i'm doing cleanups to buffer.c right now. (there was a
file-corrupting bug wrt. file system holes in there too). David S. Miller
noticed that BH_Protected is redundant as well (can be substitued via
b_count++), he is also fixing a bad bug as we are speaking in
make_request()+end_io_async(). 
these latest changes have really enabled us to clean up lots of code all
across the filesystem and IO layer - i think we should be really happy
about these 'side effects' - and it shows that we are going in the right
direction, design-wise :)
