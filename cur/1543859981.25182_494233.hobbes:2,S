Hi!
 *      tty_flip_buffer_push    -       terminal
 *      @tty: tty to push
 *
 *      Queue a push of the terminal flip buffers to the line discipline. This
 *      function must not be called from IRQ context if tty->low_latency is set.
But some drivers (mxser, nozomi, hvsi...) sets low_latency to 1 in _open and
calls tty_flip_buffer_push in isr or in functions, which are called from isr.
Is the comment correct or the drivers?
Moreover, hvsi says:
tty->low_latency = 1; /* avoid throttle/tty_flip_buffer_push race */
thanks,
