If nothing is using them, they'll bit-rot, yes.  Way of the world.  But I've 
found a use for them.  Therefore, I'm interested in getting them up to date 
and then keeping them there.  I already wrote an automatic checker to tell me 
how they differ from reality, which is half the battle.  (It won't help if 
the file contents change so much the description needs to be updated, but 
that's not a common event.)
