Some people just prefer a hard copy (which obviously can't be produced for 
nothing) instead of an on-line reference. I think google.com is already a 
fairly obvious (almost instinctive) answer to any question these days.
Books vary in quality and comprehensiveness, recommendations are incredibly 
useful for somebody faced with buying into a subject he has no real knowledge 
of.
