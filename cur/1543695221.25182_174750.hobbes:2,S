Since the last shootout was so popular, I was able to get my hands on
some better hardware to run even more tests. As well the generated
results format was improved slightly. 
Bonnie++ and IOZone results on an AMD Opteron 240 system, comparing
2.6.0test5,test7,test8 as well as SCSI vs. IDE are now posted
