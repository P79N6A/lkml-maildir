Occasionally the ALI M5451 driver (trident.c) would lock down my IBM
thinkpad R30. The console would continously flash the message: 
ali: AC97 CODEC read timed out.
And the machine wouldn't respond to the keyboard or ssh. I'm trying to
reproduce and debug it now. Has anyone else run accross it? google has
been less than helpful.
