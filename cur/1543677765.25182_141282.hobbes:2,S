Yes, I'm ignoring the PCI startup code for now.  That's a twisty maze of
horrible passages that I'm going to try to tackle after this step...

Hm, good point.  Let me go check to see if we invalidate a ->next
pointer when we remove the device...
Ugh, we don't.  And what's even worse is that data could be gone...
