Thanks Larry. I downloaded 2.6.25 but hadn't had a chance to build it
yet. I'll get on that.

Yeah, doesn't seem likely. The non-boot issue was earlier in the boot
process with messages like these:
Intel machine check architecture supported.
Intel machine check reporting enabled on CPU#1
CPU1: AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Mobile Technology TK-53 stepping 01
Total of 2 processors activated (6834.25 BogoMIPS).
ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
..TIMER: vector=0x31 apic1=0 pin1=2 apic2=-1 pin2=-1
and then it just hangs.
Since I wrote the message this morning I munged through the kernel
config and came up with a config file that doesn't hang without the
options. I'll send the two config files along to the list under a
different subject line that speaks directly to this problem.
Thanks,
Mark
