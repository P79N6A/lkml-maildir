You need heavy NFS action and I/O load. Its the same box I use for
server-scenario tests. 3 GB RAM, SMP, 320 GB RAID5 (3ware), SDLT tape drive, 2
x 1000 TX. In detail:

Take several NFS clients and write to this box some GBs (all at same time),
then copy these files around on the box or tar them. You should see collapses
like from the BUG I posted lately up to complete freeze.
I have continuous cpu load above 2.0 upto about 8.0

Stephan
