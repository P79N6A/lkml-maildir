Why couldn't you synchronously put the cm_id in a state of
"pending delete" and do the actual delete when the RNIC
provides a response to the request? There could even be
an optional method to see if the device is capable of
cancelling the request. I know it can't yank a SYN back
from the wire, but it could refrain from retransmitting.
