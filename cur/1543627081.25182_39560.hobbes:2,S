Hi,
   Having gotten my SiS300 running with DRM, whenever
I run a program requiring an OpenGL, mulitiple
scrambled copies of the program's screen are
then present on the screen below the second damper
wire on my monitor (I have attached a copy of what
it looks like if anyone is interested).a
   Nothing crashes when this happens and can be
rectified by resetting the window manager.
   Memory isn't a problem with over 100M free.
   I don't know if this is a problem with the SiS
support in the kernel or an XFree86 problem.
   Any help would be appreciated and apologies
if this isn't a kernel problem.
Regards
