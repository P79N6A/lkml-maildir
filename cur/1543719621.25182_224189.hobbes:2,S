Incidentally, what happens when kswapd becomes a zombie? I've seen
this a few times, and I am currently posting on a machine that has
been up for 15 days, and which oopsed 10 or so days ago (something to
do with nfs, but don't worry about that - the machine is running
2.4.20, and is not exactly up-to-date), killing kswapd.
But I don't notice anything at all different about how the system is
behaving. However, I haven't been doing much more than running emacs
and mozilla recently - I haven't been running my visualisation
software that typically stresses the VM beyond usefullness.
