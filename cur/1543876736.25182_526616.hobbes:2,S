Sure, that was my point from the start.

Most hypervisors already do this, and it's an unrelated topic. 
What we're trying to achieve is to make sure not every hypervisor
and simulator has to introduce its own set of drivers.

yes, that should embed the bus_type.

Sorry, I've been working too long on the lesser architectures.
IRQ number are evil indeed.
However, I'm pretty sure that we need _some_ abstraction of an
interrupt mechanism here. The easiest way is probably to have a
callback function like
	int (*irq_handler)(struct virt_dev*, unsigned long message);
in the virt_dev.
