In any case, this discussion is moot because the kernel API is changing
for the better and there is a clearly defined fix for ndiswrapper that
will allow it to continue to work even with the new interface:  allocate
a separate ndiswrapper stack (IE: Not the kernel stacks).  The kernel is
under no obligation not to break out-of-tree drivers, etc, even semi- 
non-
-binary-only ones such as ndiswrapper.  Figure out how to fix it and
move on!
