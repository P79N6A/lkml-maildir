They are _not_ spurious. Connection did not enter ESTABLISHED state.
If it entered this state, we would have no rights to timeout.
It should be closed with FIN etc. etc.
In fact we do the only thing, which is possible without further
violation of protocol.
About uglyness. Violations of protocol are ugly. When all
the things proceed in a legal way undistingushable,
it is beautiful. 8)

In the case of timeout no special actions are required, that's point.
