And next time he can figure this out himself looking at
drivers/char/Kconfig:
#
# Character device configuration
#
menu "Character devices"
config VT
        bool "Virtual terminal"
        requires INPUT=y
and just after that:
config VT_CONSOLE
        bool "Support for console on virtual terminal"
        depends on VT
