DSP operations like, particularly with digital synthesis, tend to max
the CPU doing vector operations on as many processors as it can get
a hold of. In a live performance critical application, it's important
to be able to deliver a protected amount of CPU to a thread doing that
work as well as response to external input such as controllers, etc...

These are app issue and not really somethings that's mutable in kernel
per se with regard to the -rt patch.

I have Solaris style adaptive locks in my tree with my lockstat patch
under -rt. I've also modified my lockstat patch to track readers
correctly now with rwsem and the like to see where the single reader
limitation in the rtmutex blows it.
So far I've seen less than 10 percent of in-kernel contention events
actually worth spinning on and the rest of the stats imply that the
mutex owner in question is either preempted or blocked on something
else.
I've been trying to get folks to try this on a larger machine than my
2x AMD64 box so that I there is more data regarding Linux contention
and overschedulling in -rt.
