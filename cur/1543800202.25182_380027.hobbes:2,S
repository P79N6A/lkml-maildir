Thanks for the table. This certainly is a good starting point to find 
valid candidates for uninlining.

What about the (probably more common) case that the inlined version is 
smaller because of optimizations that are not possible in the general 
case?

Maybe the estimate is a little bit too rough. All savings add up to 
1780743 bytes, which seems a bit too large to me (can't compare to the
total size of an allyesconfig kernel since that gives me a 'File size 
limit exceeded' when linking).
What about the previous suggestion to remove inline from *all* static 
inline functions in .c files?
I just tried that for the fun of it. It got rid of 8806 'inline' 
annotations and produced the ~2 MB (uncompressed) patch at
   
http://www.physik3.uni-rostock.de/tim/kernel/2.6/deinline.patch.gz
The resulting kernel actually booted (am running it right now). However, 
catching just these low-hanging fruits doesn't get me anywhere near 
Arjan's numbers. For my non-representative personal config I get (on 
i386 with -unit-at-a-time):
   > size vmlinux*
      text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   2197105  386568  316840 2900513  2c4221 vmlinux
   2144453  392100  316840 2853393  2b8a11 vmlinux.deinline
I just started an allyesconfig build to get some real numbers.
