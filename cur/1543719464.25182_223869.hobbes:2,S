My question is: why do everything inside the kernel?
Even  'khttpd' has  been removed  from  the kernel,  because the  same
efficiency has been achieved in  the *userland* apache module.  Why is
the input layer moving _backwards_?
I  don't think  converting  between keyboard/mouse  protocols and  the
input   system's  "struct   input_event"  has   a   tighter  real-time
requirement  than a  heavily loaded  web  server.  How  many keys  per
second can  you type  at?  (Even  if you type  extremely fast  and the
hardware constraints  (velocity, etc.) are  not reached yet,  there is
still  a  limit that  the  keyboard  controller,  e.g.  i8042,  cannot
exceed.)  How  many mouse movements are  you making per  second?  Is a
userland driver unable  to handle that data rate?   (I don't think so.
I believe enve a 386-DX 33MHz  can handle it with ease.)  If not, then
please do it  in userland, so as not to waste  kernel memory (which is
*NON-swappable*).
