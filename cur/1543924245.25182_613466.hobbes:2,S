I forgot again the one as an host environment. :-)
AFAIK, mn10300 series are for embedded systems and I've never heard as
development hosts.
I had noticed the new machine name needs to be added / changed, though.

I think `am33' is a reasonable name if  it is the first variant of
mn10300 series
that is supported by Linux, like `am33' is for glibc and `i386' is
(was) for Linux and others.
People don't misunderstand that an AM30, AM31 or AM32 is supported by Linux.
AM3n seems to be upper compatible with AM3(n-1), so far.
MEI (and only they) know if AM34, and any newer core in that series
are compatible with AM33.

I see.
I know there is no technical problem if the arch name continues to be mn10300.
It is an issue of some branding strategy, or a designing policy.
I understand you (RH) are not in a position to decide to change, nor
to refuse to change.
I just noticed and became worried about the mismatch.
If MEI ask you to change the toolchain name from am33 to mn10300, I
have no objection to that.
I'd be glad to hear any comments from MEI.
