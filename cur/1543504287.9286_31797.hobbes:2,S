I am not too sure you could rely on this.

there have been several approaches to larger NVRAM sizes (one for the PS/2
and one by Compaq at least).

   3. you have several seconds to wait for the autodetection to work
   4. nobody else sets the RTC
   5. if you have an old RTC, it will handle the bit 6 set case correctly
