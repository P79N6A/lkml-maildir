The things that do can use it, though.  Here's a place where inconsistency

This immediately strikes me as a really bad idea.  Stuff moves between
files.  Two files might really want to signal an event from the same
source.

As long as we're religious about making every subsystem standardize these
names, it should be ok.  Another reason to macro-ize.  There are way too
many people touching too much code that might take advantage of a generic
kernel->user event to rely on soft rules.

Assuming that we're going to be doing file notifications via this,
wouldn't something like "/fs/file close /path/to/foo" be right(er)?
