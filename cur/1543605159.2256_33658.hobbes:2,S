Just a guess - if you are getting reads that are about the same as writes,
then it would indicate that the code is doing "read-modify-write" for the
existing file data rather than just "write".  This would be caused by not
writing only full-sized aligned blocks to the files.
As to why this is happening only over the network - it may be that you are
are unable to send an even multiple of the blocksize over the network (MTU)
and this is causing fragmented writes.  Try using a smaller block size like
4k or so to see if it makes a difference.
Another possibility is that with 8k chunks you are needing order-1
allocations to receive the data and this is causing a lot of searching for
buffers to free.
Cheers, Andreas
