My opinion, for what its worth:
Do 3D first and only.  2D is a subset of 3D.  Implement as much of
OpenGL as you can in hardware and software can emulate any 2D interface
desired.
I agree that existing graphics cards do 2D just fine.  I can get a ATI
card for $20 that does all the 2D I need.  But 2D isn't enough for me.
I spend $400 on one Nvidia card.  Maybe I'm not the average, common
user, but users like me have the highest profit margin. :-)
I'm a pragmatic user.  I'd like full-featured Open Source drivers for my
Nvidia card but I use the binary because they work really well and for
me, (excellent_performance - closed_drivers) > (crappy_performance +
open_drivers).
If it can be done well enough to run Doom 3 in 640x480 at 20 fps for
less than $500, I'll buy one.  That's the performance level where I'd
consider sacrificing 60 fps for the open drivers.
Of course, in 5 years I'll expect 120 fps so its definitely a moving
target.
