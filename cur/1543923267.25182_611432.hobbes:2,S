 One of the reasons I do 15 GB transfers is to make sure that I am well above the possible page cache size. And of course I am doing a final sync to finish the runs :-) The sync is also running faster in 2.6.24-rc1.
 If I factor it in the results for dd1/dd3 are:
test                2.6.19.2        2.6.22.6    2.6.24-rc1
sync time       18sec            19sec      6sec
dd1                     27.5                 47.5        92
dd3                     3x9.1              3x8.5       3x29
So basically including the sync time make 2.6.24-rc1 even more promosing. Now, I know that my benchmarks numbers are crude and show only a very small aspect of system performance. But - it is an aspect I care about a lot. And those benchmarks match my use-case pretty good.
Cheers
