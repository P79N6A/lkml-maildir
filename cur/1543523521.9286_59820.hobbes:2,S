Again this problem :-(  Some devices don't send the signal UNIT_ATTENTION when
the disk is changed, so Linux don't know it has to flush the caches. I had the
same problem with my M/O drive, then I discovered that a jumper can
enable/disable that signal...
You can solve the problem trying to mount the device while no disk is
inserted. The failure will force a call to  invalidate_buffers() (see
sd.c:check_media_change()). Then insert a new disk; it should work fine now.
Bye.
