They don't - for example Gentoo closes the bug report with "UPSTREAM"
and doesn't take care at all.

Why not? I am Joe Random User and I am compiling my kernel and the
result is usually better than if I use the tampered-with kernel from
my distribution (Gentoo).
I think there's nothing that could prevent ordinary user to use directly
the kernel, if there are clear enough instructions how to use the
kernel.
It's not difficult to make a unknowing user use a complicated system
properly. On my project 
http://ronja.twibright.com
 I managed to write a
guide according to which a totally electrically unskilled person can
build a optical wireless networking hardware and it works on the first
try. Without oscilloscope, just with a cheap multimeter.

I am Joe Random User and I am getting lost in it. It's pointing to
various sources and I don't know what's official and what and what
I should read first and what last. Why not organize it better? I don't
think it would require much work.

The source is not documentation. From the source the reader can
incorrectly assume something about the interface that is not generally
true, but is just the case of the implementation in one version. And
then it will stop working with kernel upgrade.
Where are all the interfaces (i. e. towards userland and towards
hardware) of the kernel described? The Documentation/ directory contains
only very superficial documentation.
