i have a KVM too to two testsystems and unfortunately i cannot reproduce
your problems neither with KVM (key-based-)switching nor with scroll
lock. But this KVM uses a triple-key combination to switch, not
scroll-lock.
it's a PS2 keyboard, right? If yes then does:
	echo 0 > /proc/irq/1/i8042/threaded
	( maybe also: echo 0 > /proc/irq/12/i8042/threaded )
fix the problem? The PS2 driver has been a bit unrobust when hardirq
redirection is enabled.
