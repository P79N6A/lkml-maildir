{Shrug} That's the command that was in both Documentation/Changes and
in scripts/ver_linux and I just left what was already there, as shown
by your quote. Somebody MUCH more knowledgable than me regarding
kernel requirements can sort that out.

RedHat distribute mount separately from util-linux and I wouldnae be
surprised if others do the same...

Probably. As stated, that's what's currently installed here, and I
havenae the foggiest whether any of them need upgrading as there's
nothing I've been able to find to say what the minimum version is.

Not on RedHat systems.

Maybe, but that's not for me to decide. Whoever wrote ver_linux
obviously thought it important.

Neither am I. The ver_linux script has lines for determining the
versions for both Console Tools and Kbd but on EVERY system I've
tried, including Slackware, RedHat, Debian, Caldera, and SuSE based
ones, the line for determining Kbd versiondoesnae work. I've just
included the line that worked, and ignored the Kbd one as I can see no
point including something that doesnae work.
Best wishes from Riley.
