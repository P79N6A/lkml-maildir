  Sorry, its me talking "majordomo" -- when a filter is triggered,
  a "BOUNCE" is sent to the listowner(s) for their analysis and decission.
  So yes, they are filtered already by way of a loop filter we have
  introduced, because every now and then people use MTA/MUA softwares
  that make a mistake at receiving a message and consider visible
  "To:" and "Cc:" headers to carry relevant data for message routing..
  Think a bit of this message; "To:" says  "linux-kernel@vger", but
  it will nevertheless be sent to thousands of recipients whose
  addresses are not visible in these headers at all.
  The Internet Email is routed and transported by SMTP-envelope data,
  which in normal cases is not displayed in visible headers.
  Things in these visible headers have at most incidental relationship
  with actual message routing and destinations.
