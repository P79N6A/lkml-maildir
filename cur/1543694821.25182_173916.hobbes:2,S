> 
> Started as a research project into file systems and self-stabilization in
> Ben Gurion University of the Negev Department of Computer Science, the
> project aims to integrate self-stabilization methods and algorithms into
> the file (and operation) systems to provide a system with a desired
> behavior in the presence of transient faults.

> Based on layered self-stabilizing algorithms, provide a tree replication

> 2) a user space caching daemon, which provide the stabilization and

This sounds fairly similar to Coda[0], which is already in development and use.
