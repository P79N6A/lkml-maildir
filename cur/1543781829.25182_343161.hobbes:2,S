the error that you see is because you haven't set a big enough size in 
the BIOS for the IOMMU. The error message is just saying that the kernel 
is enabling the IOMMU anyway. It used to be that it would enable 64MB, 
it looks like it's defaulting now to 256MB. When you enable a big enough 
size in the bios this error will go away (assuming that your bios fills 
in the registers correctly).
