I get that. The check to bail out is made after we've already done the
scanning. I wanted to be clear that contiguity in highmem is required for
hugepages.

Ok, with KOSAKI's patch we
1. Set order to 0 (and stop kswapd doing what it was asked to do)
2. goto loop_again
3. nr_reclaimed gets set to 0 (meaning we lose that value, but no biggie
   as it doesn't get used by the caller anyway)
4. Reset all priorities
5. Do something like the following
	for (priority = DEF_PRIORITY; priority >= 0; priority--) {
		...
		all_zones_ok = 1;
		for (i = pgdat->nr_zones - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
			...
			if (inactive_anon_is_low(zone)) {
				shrink_active_list(SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX, zone,
					&sc, priority, 0);
			}
			if (!zone_watermark_ok(zone, order, zone->pages_high,
					0, 0)) {
				end_zone = i;
				break;
			}
		}
	}
  So, by looping around, we could end up shrinking the active list again
  before we recheck the zone watermarks depending on the size of the
  inactive lists.
If the size of the lists is ok, I agree that we'll go through the lists,
do no reclaiming and exit out, albeit returning 0 when we have reclaimed pages.

i.e.
if (!all_zones_ok && sc.order == 0) {
? or something else
What I did miss was that we have 
                if (nr_reclaimed >= SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX)
                        break;
so with my patch, kswapd is bailing out early without trying to reclaim for
high-orders that hard. That was not what I intended as it means we only ever
really rebalance the full system for order-0 pages and for everything else we
do relatively light scanning. The impact is that high-order users will direct
reclaim rather than depending on kswapd scanning very heavily. Arguably,
this is a good thing.
However, it also means that KOSAKI's and my patches only differs in that mine
bails early and KOSAKI rechecks everything at order-0, possibly reclaiming
more. If the comment was not so misleading, I'd have been a lot happier.

Which one, KOSAKI's or my one?
Here is my one again which bails out for any high-order allocation after
just light scanning.

Subject: [PATCH] mm: stop kswapd's infinite loop at high order allocation
Wassim Dagash reported the following (editted) kswapd infinite loop problem.
  kswapd runs in some infinite loop trying to swap until order 10 of zone
  highmem is OK.... kswapd will continue to try to balance order 10 of zone
  highmem forever (or until someone release a very large chunk of highmem).
For costly high-order allocations, the system may never be balanced due to
fragmentation but kswapd should not infinitely loop as a result. The
following patch lets kswapd stop reclaiming in the event it cannot
balance zones and the order is high-order.
