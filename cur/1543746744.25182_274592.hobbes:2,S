That's going to take severe brain-ache to get right ... and worse,
keep right.  These headers aren't going to get tested outside the kernel
tree often.  So we'll have missing includes and files that only work if
the <linux/> they're including is a kernel one rather than a user one.
I'm not particularly stuck on the <user/> namespace.  We could invent
a better name.  How about <kern/> and <arch/> to replace <linux/>
and <asm/>?  Obviously keeping linux/ and asm/ symlinks for backwards
compatibility.
