Well, if you set the uart to be 16450 using setserial, this will cause
Linux to avoid enabling the FIFO.  That will cause the loop to save
the 4 character times (which at 9600 bps is 4ms).  If your original
protocol is writing six characters, and then reads 2 characters in a
tight loop, that means a total cycle takes 8ms, and disabling the FIFO
will have significant savings assuming that all other causes of
latencies have been removed.  (The FIFO delay can cause a slowdown by
50%).
