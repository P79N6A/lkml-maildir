Yes and No.
I have only tried to revert lazy-read optimization (without any visible 
change) so I have reapplied it AND THAN I have reverted changes in 
mm/filemap.c... and performance has gone back.

YES, I agree.
I haven't done a lot of tests but it seems to me that the changes in 
mm/filemap.c are the only things that influence the sequential read 
performance on my disk.
