It does disable it in general, unless they're marked inline explicitely :
The traditional gcc 2.x rules were:
I Only inline what is marked inline (but it can decide to
not inline)
II Also inline others heuristically only with 
-O3 / -finline-functions [which we don't set in the kernel]
Then at some point this additional rule was added:
- Also inline everything static that is only called once
[on the theory that this shrinks code size which is true
according to my measurements]
-fno-inline-functions-called once disables this new rule.
It's very well and clearly defined.
