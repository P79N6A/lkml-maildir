I thought about this too, and I realized that cpus_allowed is by default
0xffffffff (i.e., all procs in the system).  That means this is only an
issue when the administrator explicitly changed affinity.
And that would occur in the situation you describe ... personally, I
think users should be able to set their masks but I completely see your
argument.
I suppose we could count the bits in cpus_allowed and make sure they are
less than or equal to the new_mask bits.  This seems overkill, though. 
We could just not allow users to change their own affinity without
CAP_SYS_NICE, and allow root to do anything (via CAP_SYS_ADMIN).
Anyone else have an opinion?
