The cure is simple.
Make sure that MACHINE is always assined a sensible value.
MACHINE := sa1100 # Default value to avoid invalid pathnames with no .config
The recursion into the subdirectories does only take care of files listed
with EXTRA_TARGETS, host-progs, and clean-files.
Only EXTRA_TARGETS are used in the mach- Makefile, and since this is a
*.o file it will anyway be deleted by the find that searches the full
tree when you do a make clean.
Make clean execute a find -name '*.[oas]' and remove all such files,
and use the recursion only to take care of other generated files
spread out over the kernel src tree.
