First try to set power_save_controller=0 module option for
snd-hda-intel.  If this doesn't make any difference, try to turn
CONFIG_SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE off.  If the problem still persists, then I
have no idea what change triggered it.  Maybe you got this in the
earlier versions but in less verbose way...
