ok, the ext3-2.4-0.9.17 patch fixes this bug. thank you. that means that
2.4.17-rc2 with the patch applied makes it through a full *double* cerberus run
succesfully. I also tried the same with ext2 and it made it through as well. I
plan to try and 18-preX as well soon. If only such a test wasn't a day and a
half long...
The only other thing that seems to effecting a lot of people (including a
friend of mine) that I can't re-produce here, is the OOPses... A box that was
stable with 2.4.12 oops'es in short time with 2.4.1[67]. The box in question is
a Dell desktop running a netfilter firewall.
