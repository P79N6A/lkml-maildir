There is a subtle point that this comment misses, it's worth thinking about.
This thread has been about the idea of being able to send any one of those
changes out in isolation, right?  That's the problem we are solving.  But
your statement is that you want to test them all at once, testing them one
at a time is too much work.
Doesn't that mean that you don't even know if these changes compile, let
alone run, when you send them out individually?  You haven't tested them,
you've only tested the set of them as one unit.
In many environments, BK is doing exactly the right thing.  It lets you send
the stuff you've tested together.
