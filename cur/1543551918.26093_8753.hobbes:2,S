Maybe we can close this thread here :)
Both of C and C++ is turing compatible so which is written in C++ can be done
in C too. So anyone can write kernel modules in C++ and search for a C++ -> C
converter ;-) But in this case WHY don't people write your code in C directly ?
IF someone can code C++ he must know coding in C too. From the point of view
of this kind of people, C++ gives him some plus they would like to use.
BUT Linux kernel is written in C, and the problems (interfacing with C,
implementing standard C++ libs inside the kernel etc) will reduce this plus
into a negative value imho. C++ is basically C with OOP extensions (and
some much more) so if someone can code C++ he can hapilly use C as well.
And note, that maintaining a multi-language software is much harder:
there're more hidden bugs, not every hacker can code in C++, etc ... etc ...
So imho: it does not worth ... (till' the entry kernel is written in C++ ...)
Please stop this thread, every messages try to explain the same thing against
each other ... The list should be used to share developmenting information
on Linux kernel and not starting a flame war.
