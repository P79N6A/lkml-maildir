You can use filp_open().

[Jon M. Hanson] I tried the filp_open() approach like this:
struct file *mem_fd;
mem_fd = filp_open("/dev/mem", O_RDONLY | O_LARGEFILE, 0);
I then have a check if IS_ERR(mem_fd) is true immediately afterwards
along with a printk saying it failed. This condition is true when I ran
it.
