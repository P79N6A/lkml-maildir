Subject: Can't boot with 2.0.37-pre2 with a DFI P5BV3+ Rev. B+

Hi !
I have a DFI P5BV3+ Rev. B+ with a AMD K6-2 300 Mhz - and it won't boot
with the 2.0.27-pre2 Kernel. It works with 2.0.37-pre1. The file wich
causes the problem is linux/arch/i386/kernel/head.S . I am sorry, but i
cannot determine the routien wich causes the problem, but i haven't ever
really programmed assembler...
error-desciption
The Kernel is loading .............. (all the dots appear) and after the
last dot, i can hardly see anything, but i believe there are 2-4 more
appearing (uncompressing and/or starting) and then the Computer does a
reboot - not hanging but immediately rebooting. This happens with
2.0.37-pre2 and 2.0.37-pre9 (and i think with all between).
solution:
this is not really a solution, but of course i can copy the head.S from
2.0.37-pre1 to my current version.
Sorry, but i can't tell you more. The 2.2 Kernel works (but my VideoText
doesn't with 2.2, but this can be due to my configuration) - and he
tells me somthing about DMA-Hangs and workaround (i thing this is not
important, but if you want to, i can post the exact message).
please help ;-)
Ciao
