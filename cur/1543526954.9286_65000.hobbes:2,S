Hi,
Well, that's not such a bad idea! :-)
But as I said... I wish to do this so I can to some "kernel module writing fun". ;-)
Maybe I'll just take it as you say , and just start up trying it this way, and later on
dig deeper into the darkness of the Linux kernel.. Booohoo!
Thanks for your answer and for being such a guide! ;-)
Regards / Jörgen

Yep. At least I think so (all rights and wrongs reserved). Whatever you have
described so far can be done with a named pipe or a unix domain socket and a
daemon reading from it. And it is much easier. Unless you want to have some
kernel module writing fun ;-)
