1) The printk is misleading.  We're hitting this condition because the 
user has hit the limit, not merely approached it.
2) This should probably be KERN_INFO.  The kernel itself is not in any 
danger because of this condition.
3) You should only be printing a warning if the user's hard limit is 
exceeded, not the soft limit.  While these default to the same value, 
applications are free to deliberately lower their soft limit to 
self-manage their resource utilization.  It's even perfectly valid (if 
uncommon) to lower the limit and deliberately keep your process count 
right at that limit by forking opportunistically.  If an application is 
doing this, you don't need or want to spam the message logs.  So, check 
to see if p->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_NPROC].rlim_cur == 
p->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_NPROC].rlim_max before spewing this out into the log.
4) Even with the printk_ratelimit, lowering the priority to KERN_INFO, 
and only logging when the hard limit is reached, an unprivileged user 
can still spam the system logs.  Perhaps a sysctl is in order?
