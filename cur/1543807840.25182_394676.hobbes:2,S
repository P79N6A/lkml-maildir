ok, after reading more of your post, agreed.

This is the bit that needs a long period of prototyping and experimental
use IMHO.  So in essence, we're agreeing on that point.

Right, well, I think our approaches might have more in common than
I previously thought.
Indeed, it seems that at least one of the features of Linux-VServer I am
preparing for consideration for inclusion into Linus' tree are your work
:-).

ok, but the question is - doesn't this just constitute a refactoring 
once the stable virtualisation code is in?
I'm just a bit nervous about trying to 
refactor-approach-and-concepts-as-we-go.
But look, I'll take a closer look at your patches, and see if I can 
merge with you anyhow.  Thanks for the git repo!
Sam.
