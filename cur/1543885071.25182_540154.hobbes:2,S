Again, slab has no way of actually estimating how many pages you need 
for a given number of objects. So we end up calculating some upper bound 
which doesn't belong in mm/slab.c. I am perfectly okay with:
   (1) kmem_nr_bytes_per_object which is what Peter has now
or alternatively,
   (2) kmem_nr_objects_per_page which I think Christoph suggested
Both of them, the slab knows the answer, and doesn't need to guess. It's 
up to the caller to figure out what the acceptable upper bound is.
