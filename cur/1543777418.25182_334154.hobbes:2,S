Well, at this point interrupts are enabled, and _are_ handled.  The
only thing we use the IIR for is to answer the question "did this
device say it had an interrupt?"
If it did, we unconditionally read the MSR without fail.
So, I've no idea what so ever about what's going on here.  I don't
understand why your system is behaving the way it is.  Therefore,
I don't think we can progress this any further, sorry.
