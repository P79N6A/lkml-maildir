Subject: [PATCH 18/18] MMC: OMAP: Do not busy wait for end of command for ever
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Jarkko Lavinen <jarkko.lavinen@nokia.com>
The limit was a fixed 100k limit in the busy loop, which is not
accurate. It would better to have time limit for the worst case
which occurs when sending 80 cycles at 400 kHz and takes about
200 microseconds, so limit the max time spend in the busy loop
for some 250 microseconds.
