 I'm still running 2.4 on this box, with a combi drive as the primary
slave.  That shows twice too, as
hdb: HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4320B, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
and then _many_ lines later is the second part
hdb: attached ide-scsi driver.
scsi1: SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
  Vendor: HL-DT-ST  Model: RW/DVD GCC-4320B  Rev: 1.01
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
 So I guess all that's happening is that the two parts come together
when we give up ide-scsi.  The error messages look as if the kernel is
trying to find any partitions, which isn't going to happen without media
- you should see how many error messages I get from an ATPAI ZIP drive
in 2.4 when I boot without media, but they're nothing to worry about.
