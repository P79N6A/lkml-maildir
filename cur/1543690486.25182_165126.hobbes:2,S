You're quite right, but the I-Cache is a non issue: this code will be
evicted when there is need to put something else. And because its only run
once at the beginning of the program, it won't cause anything important to
be evicted. You can complain about the time it gets to fetch the code from
RAM though.
Quoting another post from you: "I do _not_ advocate using asm anywhere
except speed critical code."
This code is obviously not critical. So, it makes a bad choice for
discussion.
