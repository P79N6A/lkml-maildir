RE: cache
Yes, at least a synchronize, but can we always know (in time) if the medium
has been removed?  We may not always get an eject request, right?
I think write-back cache is inherently unsafe in general, but I guess we
have to allow unsafe things like that for non-production use.

Well, the cache is pretty often part of the permanent assembly, not part of 
the removable medium, so I think it should still be called for removable 
media. That begs the question, of course, what should the cache type be---it
strikes me as rather unsafe to have a removable RW medium with a write back 
cache?  I suppose at the very least we should to a SYNCHRONIZE on ejection
if 
it's write back?
