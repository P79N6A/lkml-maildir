I believe C99 defines 'char' as the smallest addressable unit of
memory. Meaning -- it would be difficult to define 'u8' where 'char'
was larger than 8 bits. This is why the wchar_t stuff came about.
Is is doubtful than any new hardware would be made so difficult to
port code to. Older hardware that used 6 bit bytes (among other sizes)
should be obsoleted.
That being said... the code should probably check the size, and allow
the host compiler to choose whether or not to optimize the check away.
