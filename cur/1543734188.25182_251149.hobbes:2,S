Sorry I missed the flare up of this topic.  What about events for which
there is no associated kobject?
why is the kobject argument not first?  Seems weird..
What happened to a formatted string argument?  The signal argument can 
become the pre-formatted string, and someone can provide a wrapper
that takes a printf() like format and args.
	kobject_uevent_printf(kobj, "something bad: 0x%08x", err);
