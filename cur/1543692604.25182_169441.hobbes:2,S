And those people are wrong. If they want to save bloat, instead of
'fixing' things by removing <1 page of .text, how about working on
some of the real problems like shrinking some of the growth of various
data structures that actually *matter*.
The "I don't want Athlon code in my kernel because I run a P4 and
it makes it slow/bigger" argument is totally bogus. It's akin to
the gentoo-esque "I compiled my distro with -march=p4 and now
my /bin/ls is faster than yours" argument.

F00F workaround was enabled on every kernel that is possible
to boot on affected hardware last time I looked.
This is what you seem to be missing, it's not optional.
If its possible to boot that kernel on affected hardware, 
it needs errata workarounds.

Said patch isn't included in mainline, so this argument is bogus.
Relative merits of that patch were already discussed in another thread.
