Note that the people who care most about x86 kernel size, such as people 
running on brand new 486 and 586 embedded processors (AMD Elan, ...) are 
precisely the people that don't need the "convenience" of having the 
feature dynamically patched into the kernel.
Removal of CONFIG_SSE2 was wrong for this same reason.
300 bytes here, 300 bytes there, and all this code is adding up quick.
We have CONFIG_EMBEDDED to hide such things from your sight, so you 
don't even have to worry about them...  they will always be dynamically 
patched in your kernels :)
