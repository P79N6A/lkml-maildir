You don't provide enough information to even guess. The whole of the
relevant part of the ata messages would be a lot more useful than the
cutting/pasting of bits you've provided.
The BIOS finding the drive is indicating it responds to identify and the
basic commands (and usually means your cabling is fine), but really the
rest of the trace is needed to see what occurs next. If the drive has
gone then the partition table read will fail and you won't
get /dev/sdb[something] for it.
