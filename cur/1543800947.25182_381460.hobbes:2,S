Your analysis is very interesting and seems correct. My analysis is
similar, but a bit
different
Best case is S+nK is aligned
Worst case is S+nK is off by +1 byte from an alignment boundary
Taking the worst case, we find a-1 bytes of space eaten up by the
alignment operation.
We need to see if the a-1 bytes that we lost, could have accommodated
another object of
size o and a bufctl of size K. If that is true we need to reduce n.
The equation becomes
If o+K < a-1, reduce n
If a is atmost o, then it leads to (from your analysis assumption)
if K < -1 reduce n, K is certainly positive, hence do not reduce n.
