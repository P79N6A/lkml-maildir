Well, I can't speak to the 'real' meaning of TIF_MEMDIE with authority,
but I can speak to the meaning of cpuset flags.
The mem_exclusive flag doesn't mean this.
It means that you cannot overlap the memory of a sibling cpuset.
You will, necessarily, still overlap the memory of your ancestor cpusets.
Whether or not you make any use of the mem_exclusive flag, you still
get the same (limited) guarantees of memory usage -- namely that your
memory won't be used by tasks in non-overlapping cpusets, with some
exceptions, such as:
 1) memory handed out to interrupt code,
 2) memory handed out for GFP_ATOMIC requests, and
 3) tasks marked PF_EXITING -- will soon free up memory
Tasks in cpusets ancestor to your tasks cpuset can always, easily,
use memory on the same nodes your task is on.
