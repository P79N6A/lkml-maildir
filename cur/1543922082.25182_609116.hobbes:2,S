    Hi all :)
I'm thinking about switching fully to libata in the near future
(currently I'm using CONFIG_IDE for all my PATA drives, both hard disks
and DVD recorder), and I was wondering if PATA support for VIA8237 was
full or not. For what I've googled, it seems that it is usable both for
PATA and for SATA, but I want to be sure.
If I'm asking here is because I have SATA support for my VIA chipset
enabled in the kernel (CONFIG_SATA_VIA), but I'm getting these messages:
    sata_via 0000:00:0c.0: version 2.0
    sata_via 0000:00:0c.0: routed to hard irq line 10
    ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xFE00 ctl 0xFE0A bmdma 0xFA00 irq 10
    ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xFD00 ctl 0xFD0A bmdma 0xFA08 irq 10
    scsi0 : sata_via
    ata1: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 310)

    scsi1 : sata_via

    ata3: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xF900 ctl 0xF802 bmdma 0xF500 irq 11
    ata4: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xF700 ctl 0xF602 bmdma 0xF508 irq 11
    scsi2 : sata_via
    ata3: SATA link down 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 0 SControl 300)
>>  ATA: abnormal status 0x7F on port 0xF907
    scsi3 : sata_via
    ata4: SATA link down 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 0 SControl 300)
>>  ATA: abnormal status 0x7F on port 0xF707
Since I don't have any SATA disk on my system, I haven't given any
importance to these messages, but now that I want to switch to libata,
I'm concerned. I don't understand the marked messages, and I don't know
if they have to do with CONFIG_IDE and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX being
enabled together with CONFIG_SATA_VIA.
My kernel is 2.6.20.18 and my mobo has three PATA busses and four SATA
ports (which I think they are ata1-ata4 in the messages above. I don't
know why only two of them are marked as 1.5Gbps, according to the mobo
manual, all four are 1.5Gbps).
Thanks a lot in advance and feel free to ask if you need more
information about hardware or software.
