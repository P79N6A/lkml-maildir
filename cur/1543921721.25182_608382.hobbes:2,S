Subject: [PATCH 0/2] CFS CGroup: cleanup & usage reporting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/22/366

These two patches consist of a small cleanup to CFS, and adding a control file reporting CPU usage in milliseconds in each CGroup directory. They're just bundled together since the second patch depends slightly on the cleanups in the first patch.
