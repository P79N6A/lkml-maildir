The usual reason for these types of "volatiles" is to make type checking
happier, since "volatile void *" is compatible with any argument you
might pass.  IOW, if you pass a plain "char *" then the compiler will
promote it to "volatile char *" and not complain, and passing an already
volatile pointer will be OK too.
The volatile isn't there to modify the generated code in any way.
