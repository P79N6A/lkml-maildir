Subject: [BUG] 2.4.22-rc3 broke x86-64 ia32 emulation?

2.4.22-rc3 appears to have broken x86-64's ia32-emulation.
Now, whenever I run a 32-bit binary I get general protection
and a core dump:
strace32[371] general protection rip:4000e8fb rsp:ffffd8bc error:400
strace32[374] general protection rip:4000e8fb rsp:ffffd8ec error:400
lilo[376] general protection rip:4000e8fb rsp:ffffd8ec error:400
self[383] general protection rip:4000e8fb rsp:ffffd8ec error:400
2.4.22-rc2 and 2.6.0-test4 work fine.
My user-space is GinGin64 (RH 8.0.95 for x86-64) with 32-bit glibc
and lilo from RH8.0. 'strace32' above is a copy of RH9's strace;
I tried it since I could never get the 64-bit strace to work with
32-bit binaries.
