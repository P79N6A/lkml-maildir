i'm confused, are we looking at the same piece of code? Perhaps you are 
still looking at some older codebase? fs/gfs2/ in Steven's current GIT 
tree is a nicely isolated 29K lines of code, fs/dlm/ [distributed lock 
manager] is 11K lines of code. Both look and work like normal Linux 
code. (and there's almost zero impact to generic code.)
Contrast that size for example to the 111K lines of code in fs/xfs/, 
which no doubt has improved recently but still looks a bit alien. For 
example the myriads locking APIs are still quite confusing in XFS, and 
it still feels like a kernel within the kernel. The other cluster 
filesystem which was merged recently, OCFS2, is 44K lines of code. So 
really, on what basis do you call GFS2 "huge"?
