Good question, especially with respect to SIGHUP.
It is on my short list of very annoying kernel threads...
NFS and a few kernel threads others currently need a way to abort an
interruptible sleep when the are terminated.  Which has been a pain
finding a simple way to allow that without too much trouble.
I'm within about a day of having everything converted over to
kthreads, allowing me to kill daemonize.  Hopefully things I don't run
into any serious snags in testing...
