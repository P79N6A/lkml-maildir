those original definitions above are not quite the way i worded it.
please consult the submitted patch to see how i phrased it.
in a nutshell, my idea of deprecated is: perhaps still supported,
still being used, but there is a better alternative available right
now and you should consider switching at your convenience.
obsolete means dead/unsupported/use at own risk.  might still work but
no guarantees and could be removed at any time.
