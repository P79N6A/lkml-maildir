Theodore,
You have to be a little bit more specific. You perceive that the PBS 
freezes. Obviously this means that console access is completely 
disabled. But are you sure that you can't for example ping the box, when 
console access is impossible? Also you might not see any messages on the 
console, but what about the /var/log files?
The hardware info is relevant, but can you also include the output of:
1)dmesg (After a reboot)
2)tail -300 /var/log/messages
3)modprobe -c
4)uname -a
5) cat /proc/pci
5)Write a script that will frequently execute the output of 'vmstat 3' 
to a file and then when the box crashes, reboot and include the file in 
your e-mail. This can help people track down something peculiar that 
happens just before the box dies?
Then people that can help will take it from there...
Regards,
