I still think it's wrongly implemented. We shouldn't be slowing down the slab 
fast path for this. Also BTW if anything your check would need to be 
dependent on !in_interrupt(), otherwise the policy of slab allocations
in interrupt context will change randomly based on what the current
process is doing (that's wrong, interrupts should be always local)
But of course that would make the fast path even slower ...
