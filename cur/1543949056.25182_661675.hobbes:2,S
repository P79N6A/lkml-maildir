So it the Linux syscall interface.  It's a wrapper around the kernel
internals, including GPLONLY symbols.  Yet some userspace programs are
proprietary.

I'm actually interested in fixing this, or I would not have sent a
patch.

Well, here's the list
__create_workqueue_key
destroy_workqueue
flush_workqueue
queue_work
task_nice
usb_alloc_urb
usb_buffer_alloc
usb_buffer_free
usb_clear_halt
usb_control_msg
usb_deregister
usb_free_urb
usb_get_current_frame_number
usb_get_descriptor
usb_get_status
usb_ifnum_to_if
usb_init_urb
usb_kill_urb
usb_lock_device_for_reset
usb_register_driver
usb_reset_configuration
usb_reset_device
usb_set_interface
usb_submit_urb
usb_unlink_urb
I already know what USB folks will say.  They want proprietary drivers
to be in the userspace.  I doubt ndiswrapper will ever be ported to the
userspace.  It's much more likely that some other approach will be used.
