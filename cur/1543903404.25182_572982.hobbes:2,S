No.  I don't see a good reason to strip on ethX.  That hardware accel 
VLANs strip
is an inconvenience in my opinion, no need to force it in software as well.

I think that for Q in Q, we would need some explicit flag on each skb to 
know when to add or modify
the VID.  I was never able to think of an automatic solution that worked 
in all cases
(bridging, writing raw packets from user space, normal receive, normal 
transmit, ...)
Modifying the bridging code would fix that path, and adding a socket opt 
to deal with writing
raw packets from user-space should handle the other tricky case I believe.

What benefit will this add?  It will certainly decrease performance to 
copy around
the header for every VLAN packet, so there would have to be a good reason to
add this logic...
