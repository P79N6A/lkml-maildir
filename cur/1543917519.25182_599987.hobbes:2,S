Yep.

Yes.
I can explain it. For the network namespace stuff we need special handling
of /proc/net so that depending on the network namespace we are resolving
against you see a different behavior.  So you actually are observing
two different directories, one being a magic invisible symlink to the
other.
Currently I am resolving against current (which has a number of
limitations) and the weird ugly effect you are current seeing.
So it looks like I need to either make /proc/net a symlink to
/proc/self/net or make the network namespace something that we capture
at mount time of /proc.
This was my don't get hung up on this implementation detail version.
Thanks for pointing out it has user visible problems.  I will see
what I can do to resolve this.
