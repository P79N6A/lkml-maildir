So, if that bothers you, you should write a generic SLL, and convert a
couple of existing singly-linked lists to it as a proof-of-concept.
I dunno, though -- open-coding a singly-linked list isn't that much of a
problem; compared to a doubly-linked one, there's simply fewer things that
can go horribly wrong. :-/
