Dangerous?? You have a product that needs to ship. You can make
it work by adding a hack. You add a hack. I don't see danger at
all. I see getting the management off the back of the software
engineers so that they can fix the code. Further, you __test__ the
stuff before you ship. If usleep(0) just spins, then you use
usleep(1).
Also, I don't think any Engineer would use threads for anything
that could be potentially dangerous anyway. You create step-by-step
ordered procedures with explicit state-machines for things that
really need to happen as written. You use threads for things that
must occur, but you don't give a damn when they occur (like updating
a window on the screen or sorting keys in a database).
Cheers,
