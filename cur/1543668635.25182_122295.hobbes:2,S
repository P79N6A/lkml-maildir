Yes, I know this mantra now and that's not the problem (or will be fixed 
shortly).
This still doesn't answer what will come next. You must have _some_ idea, 
otherwise you wouldn't add a new interface, remove other infrastructure 
and provide a patch which modifies MKDEV & co. All of this only leads us 
away from the goal of dynamic device numbers. Why?
