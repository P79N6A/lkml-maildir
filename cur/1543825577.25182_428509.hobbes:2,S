I am aware of that tool and I have looked at the source. The new
program being discussed is very similar with adjustments for using the
klibc, emu86, kernel ROM support, etc. Switching to emu86 is important
to making the tool work on PPC machines. I don't know if BenH started
with vbetool source or source from another similar tool from Scitech.
I know he was looking at both of them.
