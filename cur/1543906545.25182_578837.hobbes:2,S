True, that rather suggests that some more desktoppy (that's now a word!)
people should get involved.  Folk who know how to minimize that pain.
Sometimes when I plug in a USB device I get a dialog asking if I want to
configure it ... surely it would be possible to have that mechanism also
consult a database (part of a distro, or on some web server) fpr info
about the device, and offer the option for to poke at the device a bit to
see if it behaves.  That stuff works for music CDs; why not USB devices?
