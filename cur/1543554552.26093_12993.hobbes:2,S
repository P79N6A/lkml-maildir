OK, I tried with 2.2.16 and 2.2.18pre21 compiled with egcs-2.91.66
(the kernels reported yesterday were compiled with 2.95.2).
2.2.16 oopsed faithfully (I could not get hold of the oops as several
scrolled by and none made it to the log). 2.2.18pre21 does not oops.
Bzip2 core dumps, but gzip makes it through. So it seems that my
problem has been solved already and proactively :)
