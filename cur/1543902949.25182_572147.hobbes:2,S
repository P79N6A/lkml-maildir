Looks good to me too (I'm to blame for the version posted by Doug
that only fixed ia64 ... I didn't take the time to check whether
there was a CONFIG_COMPAT option for x86_64 ... oops).

Certainly if there is ever a third architecture that needs this the
#if mess will be beyond bad.  But with only the two of us we'd trade
one ugly #ifdef line here for another half-dozen lines in each of
our Kconfig files to define the new term.  I'm not sure whether that
is a win.
