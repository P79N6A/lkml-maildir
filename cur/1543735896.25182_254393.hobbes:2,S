It seems when non PCI-PCI bridge devices are seen, linux
(I'm using 2.4.27, 2.6.x looks the same) just punts.
It seems reasonable to say:
	if(header_type ==PCI_HEADER_TYPE_BRIDGE)	{
		if(class == PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI)
			do what we do now
		else {
	  		some type of funky device, process first two
bars
			and IRQ, leave bridge stuff for device driver
		}
It seems I going to have to put in a number of tweaks in a few 
places...but this behavior seems "better"
