You mean put them in a common header, but conditionally by #if
PAGETABLE_LEVELS?  I don't think that would be much of an improvement;
it would just add more #ifs, which adds lines and conceptual
complexity.  If you go that way, you may as well put everything in one
header wrapped in #ifs, but personally I don't think that would help.
