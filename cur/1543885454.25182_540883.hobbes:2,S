I guess pseudo code below is not that strange, but real usecase:
probe()
{
	INIT_DELAYED_WORK(...);
	/* we're not issuing queue_delayed_work() in probe(), work will
	 * be started by interrupt */
	return;
}
remove()
{
	/* hang will happen here if there was no queue_delyed_work()
	 * call (like there was no interrupts, which starts rearming
	 * work */
	cancel_rearming_delayed_work();
}
Your patch will fix it, right?
