Ok, I think I finally solved this problem.
A note for Jeff: I forgot to send this email and complained to you because you 
didn't answer... Sorry Jeff.
However, I explained what I say here to him in chat and we agreed on the fix.
I'm sending this anyway... and I'm attaching the correct fix we discussed.

No, the link failure was when linking the first object together in the final 
file.
The symbol was referred to by the wrappers inserted by GCC for gprof / 
gcov, not by the symbol exporting.

And it was fixed when linking statically, as you see (because the symbol is 
not defined in dynamic libraries - don't know if this is a bug of glibc, I 
hope not).
What was needed was the addition of another EXPORT_SYMBOL, but it couldn't be 
added for everybody because it causes the build to fail for old compilers 
which don't export the symbol.
And "old compilers" include normal gcc 3.3.4 (I verified this on my Gentoo 
system).
Also, maybe adding a dependency on static linking for GCOV is needed, maybe.
After some successful testing (maybe I didn't test all cases), however, 
something strange happened: the build started failing because now GCC 
requires the GCOV options (-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage) even during 
linking (because the gcov helper functions are now in a separate library). I 
said "strange" because the same build succeeded with gcc 3.3.4, and I didn't 
understand the difference at first.
This required two changes:
- excluding the profiling options from the mk_* utilities.
- adding the GCOV options to linking (this is even documented now). I've 
retested that this wasn't needed with gcc 3.3.4 (and I guess older ones).
Finally, I got an unresolved symbol on __bb_fork_func, and I wasn't able to 
solve this (is it maybe a bug in libc or whatever? I don't know).
