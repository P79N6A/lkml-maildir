I've had a few different 2.5 kernels on this one, compiled under always
up to date debian sid (unstable). The system is (and has been) rock

I get this now and then:
favonius kernel: Bank 2: 940040000000017a
favonius kernel: MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, correctable
incident occurred on CPU 0.
but this goes unnoticed to me. 
This all with an athlon XP 3000+ btw.
