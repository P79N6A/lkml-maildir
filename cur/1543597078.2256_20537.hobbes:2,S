What is the card? Are they still using the SiS 530? I have a Presario, with 
192 meg RAM, and a SiS 530 onboard, using 8 meg shared mem. I have no 
problems concerning that, Linux se---hmm, never noticed before. Total mem 
(-swap): 183.2 meg. Doesn't say anything about the shared mem. I thought 
Linux totalled up all RAM, even that in the vid card, to be used as RAM? 
Someone told me that.....can't remember who. Never noticed that. Anyway, I'm 
not having any other problems, other than now I have to make sure the missing 
8 meg, err, 9meg, is being used. Dammit, something _else_ to investigate.
