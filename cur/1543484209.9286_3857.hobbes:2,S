Hi,  
I would have sent this to the linux-c-programming list, but it appears to 
be down.
I'm pretty new to programming on Linux, especially when it involves trying
to interface with the kernel.  I have a test program attached that basically
just trying to get status of media_changed(), so I can tell if a CDROM has
changed.  The grand plan is to set up a daemon that can monitor media 
changed events for various types of media, and do operations like automatic
mounting, kind of like mediad on IRIX.  But right now I don't have much 
clue.  So can anyone point me in the right direction?  Am I even doing the
ioctl() call right?  One thing for sure is that the call to media_changed()
generates a segmetation violation.
