No it is not.

It comes from the choice of architecture, I'd not run general purpose
code like that on MMU-less hardware. But yeah, I see your point.

Yes it does that, but there is no guarantee that those 50MB have a
single 1M contiguous region amongst them.

Mel's patches alone aren't quite enough, you also need some reclaim
modifications, I'll ping Andy to see how far he's on that.
