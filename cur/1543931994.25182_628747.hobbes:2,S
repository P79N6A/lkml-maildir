Yes, but the status quo has been *tested* on thousands of systems and is 
known to work.  Thus, changing it puts things into unknown territory, 
even if only a small number of machines actually need the current 
configuration.
Heck, there are only a small number of 386/486 machines still in 
operation and being actively updated.

Again, 24 is "right out".  25 is a "maybe", IMO.  Rene's fix could be an 
exception, since it is a DMI-keyed workaround for a specific machine and 
doesn't change behaviour in general.
