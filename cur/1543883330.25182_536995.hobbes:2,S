I think ReactOS has a bootlader that can also boot Windows, or at
least they are close to booting the Windows kernel. That bootloader
could be then used for booting Windows without BIOS calls.
I also heard that the 100-$-Laptop should now be able to use Windows.
As it's using LinuxBIOS, this could also be interesting. However,
maybe Microsoft simply modifies a special Windows for this, or they
integrate a ClosedSource part in that LinuxBIOS, I don't know ... :-(
Thanks,
