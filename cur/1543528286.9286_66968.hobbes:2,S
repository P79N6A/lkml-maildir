REDMOND, Wash., Feb. 28, 2000 -- Three years ago, Bill Bolosky and two
Microsoft colleagues were brainstorming technology advances when an idea
occurred to them -- why not save operating system disk space by storing
duplicate files as links that point to a single file housed in a central
location?
                   Not only would this save storage space, they reasoned;
it would also result in substantial performance improvements. Moreover, it
would make it faster for information technology (IT) managers
to install computers for new employees since theyd no longer be
required to copy massive amounts of data each time they set up a
new desktop.
