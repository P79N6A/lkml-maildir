Hi Mark,
Answering your questions before I forget about them and let a week pass
again...
Anything I don't comment on, means that you were right and I agree with
you.

It wastes some memory, and you may later fix something for the M41T81
and forget to fix it for the M41T85.
If your only concern is to help grepers, you can add a clear list of
supported chips either as a comment at the top of the source file, or
as Documentation/i2c/chips/m41t00. That's what we do for hardware
monitoring chips.
No big deal anyway, so the decision is up to you.

Bad assumption, indeed. Nothing prevents you from using the smbus
functions and the i2c functions in the same driver, as long as your
call to i2c_check_functionality covers every function you use. So,
just use whatever makes your driver easier to write.
Thanks,
