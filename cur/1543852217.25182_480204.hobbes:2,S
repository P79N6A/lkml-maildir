Well, those are clearly not *prefixed* with gpio_ ... :)

I'd rather just see a "convention".  In some important cases, these calls
should map to a handful of instructions to read or write chip registers.
Talking about a "driver" or "layer" implies hundreds of instructions,
which means people _will_ regularly need to bypass it for bitbanging.
A convention for how to package those features would make sense, if for
no other reason than to avoid "how does _this_ platform do it?" confusion.
Most code touching GPIOs is platform-specific, but maybe not all of it...
I can see it including:
    - GPIOs are identified by platform-specific unsigned integers;
      in the range 0..INT_MAX (i.e. "negative" means reserved/invalid).
    - "#include <asm/arch/gpio.h>" (or <asm/gpio.h> ?) providing these
      calls, which may be used from IRQ handlers:
	* int gpio_get_value(unsigned gpio)
	    ... returning 0, 1, or negative errno (for invalid gpio)
	* int gpio_set_value(unsigned gpio, int is_set)
	    ... returning 0 or negative errno (for invalid gpio)
	* int gpio_set_direction(unsigned gpio, int is_in /* or is_out? */)
	    ... returning 0 or negative errno (for invalid gpio)
	* int gpio_request(unsigned gpio)
	    ... returning 0 or negative errno (for invalid gpio or "busy")
	* int gpio_free(unsigned gpio)
	    ... returning 0 or negative errno (for invalid gpio)
	* and platform-specific additional mechanisms.
	    ... like open-drain drive modes, ganged get/set, etc
That should work OK for AVR32 (by demonstration!) and many ARMs (including
OMAP, AT91, PXA, DaVinci, and more).  So well that providing those calls as
inlined wrappers around existing calls would be trivial!
But it wouldn't handle the other common case of chips -- like a pcf8574 I2C
gpio expander -- providing GPIO-like functionality through message passing
infrastructure.  They might need a similar API; extgpio_*() maybe.  And
the common case of "use GPIO N as an IRQ" merits thought too (for both
"real" GPIOs and external ones like that pcf8574).
But pullups are not just a GPIO thing; they're a pin configuration thing
(even on AT91 and AVR32) that can apply even if the pin is not usable as
a GPIO (e.g. as on some non-Atmel platforms).  So that stuff certainly
does not belong in generic infrastructure.

If the parameters are the same -- GPIO IDs, unsigned integers with
platforms-specific semantics -- I don't see much of a point in
requiring a platform-specific convention for naming those functions.
But sticking to a consistent *prefix* convention would be healthy.
Like gpio_request()/gpio_free(), as I stuck in the list above. :)
