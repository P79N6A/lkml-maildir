But why should I do that ? I write C, a high level language, and I don't
mind about buses or whatever. I just have to know that a 32 bit store is
atomic in a 32bit arch. There is a nice high level and portable language
feature to say 'reload this variable here'. And it lets the compiler do its
optimization work as it best can asuming it has to reload that variable.
Instead, you prefer to lock all the bus for that.
Kernel developers spent a full release to get rid of
the 'big kernel lock'. Perhaps there is another release needed to get
rid of the 'big memory barrier'.

Nope. If I want it not to reorder, put the volatile in the parameters.
So I just invalidate that variable, not everything.

My code probably is wrong without the volatile, but the compiler did the
right(tm) thing.

What is correct regarding the code I gave it.
Inlined code is:
    for (;;)
    {
        mtx = 1;
        local = spinvar;
        mtx = 0;
        if (!local)
            break;
    }
I just change mtx and don't use it for anything. So the compiler is free to
optimize out it.
If I don't want the compiler to kill it, I put the volatile.

Nope, I did the same thing with a high level and portable way.
Its like the choice between writing inlined SSE assembler or using the
vector and +,-,* builtins in gcc.
