As a matter of fact I uploaded PPSkit-0.9.1 today. It's recommended
for every user of PPSkit-0.9.0 to upgrade to this version, or to
install the needed fixes.  As i'm close to run out of disk space at
several places, it seems I'll have to close some of the older branches
in my CVS repository.  Merging into Linux 2.2.14 was done, but not
tested yet. At least it compiled. The changes are:
                            NEWS for 0.9.1
+ Provide GPG signature in addition to PGP signature.  New key
  1024D/1339BE4B has fingerprint
  1303 DDEE 2E94 0A40 A50D  EE89 BA98 F5F1 1339 BE4B
+ Fixed bug in ``adjtimex()'' to allow compilation when
  ``CONFIG_NTP_PPS'' is not defined (reported by Petri Mattila
  <petri@prihateam.fi>, thanks!).
+ Fixed an old and stupid bug in ``net/sunrpc/svcauth_des.c'' (there
  is still ``tv_usec'').
+ Fixed bug in ``ktime_to_rtc()'' that added an extra non-existing day
  on 2000-01-01.  Thanks to Harald Koenig for the solution! Updated
  ``CREDITS'' and ``README''.
