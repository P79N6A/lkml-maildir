a) It doesn't hurt, it's just a bit of a silly thing to do.
b) posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED) should get the same treatment (and
   it's the preferred way of doing readahead).
c) O_DIRECT fd's should, as much as possible, offer the same ABI as
   buffered fd's.
d) The patch could break existing apps.
