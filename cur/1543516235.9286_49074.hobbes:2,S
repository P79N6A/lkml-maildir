	The point of /proc is to avoid direct poking into the kernel memory.
Moreover, in its current form it is highly non-portable. And that includes
portability between 2.0/2.2/2.4. Please, _stop_ abusing it. Basically,
_nobody_ promises that any given file in /proc will remain there in 2.4.
Most likely 2.4 will keep compatibility symlinks, but even that is not
guaranteed. If k3wl krapplications will break - too bad for them.
	The thing is in flux right now. Some things will become sysctls,
some will move into more reasonable places and some will simply die. The
only documented parts are /proc/<pid>/*, /proc/self and /proc/sys. FWIC
the rest is fair game.

	For some things - yes. But the main overhead here is the horrible
mess in namespace (and kernel-side interfaces, but that's another story).
Again, it _will_ change. Use at your own risk and don't come complaining
if changes will break your code. You have been warned.
