As regards the "Quake III with DRI" question, I haven't seen so much 
a jerky mouse as an unresponsive mouse at times, especially in single 
user games where the local box is both client and server - but that 
does seem improved in 2.4.0-test4.
I have been so jazzed about the new scheduler behaviour that I just 
tried something which has been extremely unsatisfactory in the past,
however it worked quite nicely with the latest kernel - In a gnome 
session, with the final 2.4.0-test4 kernel compiling in an xterm,
I fired up a windowed quake III and played a round - It was slightly 
sluggish, but dammit, it was playable, and that is simply amazing!
My BSD friends are already bummed about the specweb 99 results -
When they see this they will turn green with jealousy!
