Hello,
  After loseing my hard drive to e2fs corruption I decided
to build the drive system up, so I am laying out an
raid-5 --> LVM --> reiserfs
Distribution is 7.1 (soon to be upgraded to rawhide)
My problem is I boot with milo and I can't get it to work.
I have my kernel on a dos part at sda1 and I have added
a file initrd.gz to that disk. My real root system is sda3
which is the raid.
I boot using (or try to boot)
boot sda1:/vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda3 initrd=/initrd.gz
but it can't find the file because it's on the lvm drive which
is no active yet. I tried something along the lines of
boot sda1:/vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda3 initrd=sda1:/initrd.gz
Does anyone have a clue I can use?
Please reply to me directly ad without my drives working
it's a terminal session to my email account <sigh>
