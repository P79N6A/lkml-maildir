Ok an update:
2.4 you have a problem if your port uses the lib/string.c
implementation. x86 does not and is ok (very nifty implementation of the
zeroing too)
That appears to be: 
Not vulnerable: x86 
Buggy generic: ARM, CRIS, IA-64, PA-RISC, S/390, SH64, SPARC, SPARC64,
X86-64
Buggy asm: m68k, mips (?), sh, 
Unknown: alpha, ppc
2.5 you have problems all over the place from wrong strlcpy conversions,
but those are easy enough to clean up before 2.6.0
