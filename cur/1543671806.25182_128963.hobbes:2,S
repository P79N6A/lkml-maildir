Hi,
I'm probably misreading this...but,
Have you tried this yet?  Does it modify/customize all Kconfig
and Makefiles for the selected tree splits?
A few days ago, in one tree, I rm-ed arch/{all that I don't need}
and drivers/{all that I don't need}.
After that I couldn't run "make *config" because it wants all of
those files, even if I don't want them.
So there are many edits that needed to be done in lots of
Kconfig and Makefiles if one selectively pulls or omits certain
sub-directories.

| Shows my pre-thought on this subject.  I thought a bit more,

| way in case anyone becomes interested.
| 
| First off, the kernel tarballs would be built by a script
| that splits the source tree apart appropriately and tar's it
| up.  How this is done is explained.
| 
| Second off, there's always a script to download that runs
| wget and gets the source tree from which it was downloaded.
| The whole thing.  As in, every tarball is downloaded and
| untar'd for the user, assembling the full kernel source
| tree (as it would be if you untar'd it now).
| 
| Now, I explained LOD's in that message above in small
| detail.  But, for clarity, LOD's are files which explain
| which pieces of source in the kernel tree belong to the
| LOD; what gets added to the config; where their makefiles
| are; what config options depend on other linux options;
| and what groups these LOD's are in.
| 
| A command such as `make disttree` should read the LOD's,
| split apart each linux option, tar 'em together, and
| then compress the tar's.  Then Linus could just scp the
| new directory of tar's and a script up.
| 
| As for download, the script that goes up can be
| downloaded (duh), and then run (... why do I bother?).
| Now this script would run in "dumb mode" (unless the
| user tells it not to maybe?) and rip down the whole
| tree, untar it, and rebuild the original source tree.
| I think.  I'm not sure, I really haven't tried yet.
| I'll tell you how it works after it's implimented, if
| ever that happens.  This would likely require wget.
| 
| Of course there's always the ftp method.  Go download
| the pieces you want, untar 'em, copy 'em to the same
| directory, and the build system adjusts.  but newbies
| and developers, for completely opposite reasons, will
| want to use the script in dumb mode.
| 
| For experienced users, this will make configuration
| somewhat easier, as the user can avoid being prompted
| for irrelavent drivers.  This is just a concept idea,
| not a fully thought-out idea.  What do you think?
