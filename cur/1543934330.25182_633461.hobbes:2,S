IBM has advice to not re-charge battery until it discharged to 95%.
It was implemented in their batteries/notebooks.
There is no memory effect in Li-Ion batteries, there is only limited 
number of
charge cycles -- about 1000 times, thus "as often as possible" is advice
of the battery seller :)

Last charge would be good reference. Think of the battery as constantly
degrading resource.

So, that is the state of your battery. If you buy new one, it will go 
high again.
