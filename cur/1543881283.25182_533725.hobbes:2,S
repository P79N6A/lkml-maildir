I don't think having to parallel APIs is a good idea, people will
get utterly confused which one to use.  Better always grab a reference
in kthread_create and drop it in kthread_stop.  For normal thread
no change in behaviour and only slightly more code in the slowpath.
Of course it will need an audit for half-assed kthread conversion
first to avoid task_struct reference count leaks.
In addition to that kthrad_end implementation look wrong. When
the kthread has exited prematurely no one will call complete
on kthread_stop_info.done before it's been setup.  Interestingly
the comment there indicates someone thought about threads exiting
early, but it became defunkt during all the rewrites of the
kthread code.
