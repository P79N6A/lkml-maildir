This is a 750Mhz K7 system with 1.5GB of memory in 3 512MB DIMMS.  The
DIMMS are not ECC, but we use BitKeeper here and it tells us when we
have bad DIMMS.
Guess what the memory cost?  $396.58 shipped to my door, second day air,
with a lifetime warranty.  I got it at www.memory4less.com <
http://www.memory4less.com

places other than being a customer (i.e., this isn't advertising spam).
I'm burning it in right now, I wrote a little program which fills it
with different test patterns and then reads them back to make sure they
don't lose any bits.  Seems to be working, it's done about 30 passes.
1.5GB for $400.  Amazing.  No more whining from you guys that BitKeeper
uses too much memory  [:-)]

I'd rather listen to Newton than to Mundie [MS flunkie who made a speech on
the evil-ness of open source]. He may have been dead for almost three
hundred years, but despite that he stinks up the room less.
