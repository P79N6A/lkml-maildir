Andrew,
your patch looks too complex, and doesnt cover the case of the serial
driver deadlocking. Why not add a "touch_nmi_watchdog_counter()" function
that just changes last_irq_sums instead of adding locking? This way
deadlocks will be caught in the serial code too. (because touch_nmi() will
only "postpone" the NMI watchdog lockup event, not disable it.) This
should be a matter of 5 lines ...
