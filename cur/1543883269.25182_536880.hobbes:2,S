Ingo, please ignore my first report until i found a proper way to reproduce 
the slowness cause currently CFS-v7, CFS-v7 + "renice patch", CFS-v7 + renice 
+ your private mail suggestions and CFS-v6 + "PI support for futexes patch" 
seems works equally (which is a good thing so X renicing seems really not 
needed, and there were no regression instead of my daydreams) or im too tired 
to understand the differences.
