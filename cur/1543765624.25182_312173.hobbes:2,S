What's the timeline on getting sata-promise's PATA support into 
mainline?  I've been 2.6.11-gentoo-r2, which includes this feature, for 
weeks now, and it's been perfectly stable (including md's RAID5) using 
the PATA port.  It would be nice to be able to run my system with a 
mainline kernel.
The broken-out patch that Gentoo is using is here:

Thanks,
Andy
