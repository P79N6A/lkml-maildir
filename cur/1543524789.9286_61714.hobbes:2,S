I too have noticed this, but only with DOOM... a few weeks ago
I got an urge to play doom, I had an old backup from an ancient
Slackware install which refused to run on RH 6.0 (no libc5), so I
grabbed the source + recompiled. Bang! Every time.
I ended up rebooting to DOS to play doom, and promised myself I'd
figure this one out later (I never did).
This weekend, I noticed a problem with my spectrum emulator
(spectemu-0.84 IIRC), one of the game images was acting strangely.
So I recompiled vgaspect, ran it and... boom!
It bombs out while autodetecting my card... I'm typing this at work,
so all this is off the top of my head: the first line is 'blah blah
blah undetected card' then loads of SCSI errors then 'using VGA
driver' then finally a segfault.
I kept the _old_ (precompiled) vgaspect binary, and that works fine.
Just the new recompiled one that bombs...
I suspect libsvga is doing some bad magic (though why on earth it
would mess with my SCSI subsystem is quite beyond me). I think I need
to configure libsvga, but I'm not sure how (/etc/vgalib?) or else I
need to recompile libsvga with some debug info enabled...
Does your dump program use libsvga?
For the record I also have similar hardware: a diamond fireport 40
scsi controller (ncr53c875 based) and a yamaha crw6416s cdrom drive.
The Yamaha is quite a new addition...
If I figure it out, I'll let you know, but of course if anyone can
say 'ah ha! it's XYZ' then that would save me a lot of work :-)

stephen
