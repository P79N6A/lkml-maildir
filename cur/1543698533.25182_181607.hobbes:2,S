To elaborate on this: most patches which apply to the Linux kernel are
clearly derived works of the kernel.[*]
You can write and apply such a patch , but if you distribute the patch
it must be licensed under the GPL.
Thus while _you_ may take a Linux kernel and include any proprietary
code you want in it, a vendor _may not_ send you a patch which applies
to the Linux kernel if the patch is not licensed under the GPL or a
compatible license.  A vendor is not allowed to restrict your rights
in this way.
[*] Exceptions would be patches which are very small (<10 lines is
sometimes suggested, but it's not a hard boundary), and patches which
simply add code which is clearly not derived form the kernel, as Linus
described.
