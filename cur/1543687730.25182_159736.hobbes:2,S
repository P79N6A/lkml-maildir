"nolapic" does not exist in standard 2.4.22-rc2 or 2.6.0-test3 kernels.
The patch which added nolapic support was included in 2.6.0-test3-bk8,
and 2.6.0-test<2or3>-mm<something> before that.
Passing nolapic to a kernel which doesn't recognise it causes it to
simply be passed through to init, with no error message.
So either you used non-standard versions of 2.4.22-rc2/2.6.0-test3,
or nolapic wasn't the thing that fixed your nforce2 board.
"noapic" (note: no "l") might very well fix your board, but that's
a completely different animal: it disables the I/O-APIC, which
handles board-level interrupt routing. In a kernel that supports it,
"nolapic" effectively also disables the I/O-APIC.
acpi=off or pci=noacpi might also fix the board, if ACPI is busted.
