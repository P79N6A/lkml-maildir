Not sure, haven't rebooted yet to make sure it happens again.  The
hardware is a Dell Dimension 630, Dual Xeon PIII 550mhz, 768mb of
RAM.  It's been my main machine for a number of years now.

I thought I saw something float by where someone had raised some new
locking or count variables?  I dunno... I'll work on it tonight and
