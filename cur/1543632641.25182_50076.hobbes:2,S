The original patch as posted is incorrect due to a misreading on my
part of what the flags clearing did. One of the few remotely close
to correct alternatives follows, but I will not endorse it as a
candidate for inclusion, but give it only as an illustration of how
incorrect the originally posted patch was.
Cheers,
