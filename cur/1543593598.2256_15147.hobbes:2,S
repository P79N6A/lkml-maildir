GNU General Public License Version 2, June 1991.  Section 3(b) says
"any third party", not just customers.
Nothing in the GPL restricts the source being supplied to "the people
they supply the kernel binary to, and no more".  Even if a company
refused to supply their source changes to anybody except a customer
(which would violate the GPL anyway), section 2(b) explictly allows
those customers to give the source to anybody.  Attempts to restrict
distribution will void your rights under the GPL, see section 4.
