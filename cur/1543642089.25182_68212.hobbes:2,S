It's a wee bit less brain-damaged than crackly sound cards with only 24
out of 32 address lines wired. At any rate, the issue is in all
likelihood that that support file is being circumvented. It's obviously
getting wrong information when it asks to read from a given bus as
there are no PCI devices off of node 0 (as this hasn't worked in a long
time), so perhaps a disassembly or other fishing around will reveal
whose pci config space accessors are actually being called here.
Cheers,
Bill
