WTF? The code can happily live in a function. No need to add two
copies to single file. If you need to share function between 32 and 64
bit, just put it to separate .c file.

Actually no, that's not a good reason to yell at _him_. But it is
_perfectly valid_ reason to yell at whoever commited that to x86 tree,
given that:
1) it has empty changelog (come on, "review" a patch and not notice
that changelog is empty?!) 
2) HPA said it was bad idea
3) copy&paste code remained in the patch
