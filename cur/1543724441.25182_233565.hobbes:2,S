Well, I'm now only working on some documentation, so I think I can run some 
tests if they are automated enough, on either i686 or x86-64 machine (both 
SMP).  There's about 5 - 10 GB of free disk space on each (ext3, but I can 
create a reiserfs easily, if needed).
If you want me to do this, please provide me with:
a) patches to test,
b) benchmark tools,
c) instructions (what to turn on/off in the kernel config, how to run the 
benchmarks - I need to be able to use a text editor while they are running 
and occasionally run a web browser or acroread, but I don't care much if the 
system crashes on them).
Yours,
rjw
