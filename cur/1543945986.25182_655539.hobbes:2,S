Why's that beeping noise coming from my SEP field detector? :-)

Then why was it exported in the first place?
Still, we are talking about two completely different types of
problem here: (a) the technical problem of why something stopped
working and how it should be fixed and (b) the practical problem
of users left standing in the rain while such fixing is taking
place. While (a) might look like the only real problem to kernel
developers, (b) often feels much more real to users.
Unfortunately, discussing alternative solutions to (a) does
little to solve (b).
The conventional way of addressing (b) is to avoid it altogether
by giving sufficient advance warning before removing a feature,
and sticking to the feature removal schedule. If (as apparently
in this case) that isn't possible, then other ways to mitigate
the problem need to be found. That may require switching off
some SEP field generators, though. :-)
