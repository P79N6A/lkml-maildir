If we introduce a "Reviewed-by" with reasonably clear semantics
(different from Signed-off-by; e.g. the reviewer is not a middle-man in
patch forwarding; the reviewer might have had remaining reservations...
very similar to but not entirely the same as "Acked-by" as currently
defined in -mm) --- and also make the already somewhat established
"Tested-by" more official, --- then the maintainers could start to make
it a habit to add Reviewed-by and Tested-by.
Plus, reviewers and testers could formally reply with Reviewed-by and
Tested-by lines to patch postings and even could explicitly ask the
maintainer to add these lines.

I don't think that a maintainer (who signs off on patches after all) can
easily afford to take the "bastard approach".  I may be naive.
