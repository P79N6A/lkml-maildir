If I understand correctly, there should be two different ways to report bytes_xfered:
1. for read operations, the current block/byte counter reporting is sufficient
2. for write operation, error-less BUSY assert/de-assert pairs shall be counted instead
Currently I only look at the last BUSY de-assert to verify that command is completed successfully.
As mmc_block always issues single block writes it is sufficient. If this will ever change, more
sophisticated scheme can be devised.
