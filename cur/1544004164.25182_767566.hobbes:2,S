Do you mean the following test?
        if (!active_cpus) {
                if (cpu == first_cpu(cpu_online_map))
                        smdata = &active;
        } else {
                if (cpu_isset(cpu, *active_cpus))
                        smdata = &active;
        }

take_cpu_down() may not run earlier than stop_cpu() on all the cpus
have completed the STOPMACHINE_DISABLE_IRQ step, iow. "state ==
STOPMACHINE_RUN". By that moment, 'smdata' has been set up on all
cpus... if this is the case you had in mind.
