Looks nice.
I think you may have mixed up your trees. I think this change is the cfq 
bad allocation fix which I dont think is part of your voluntary 
preemption patch:
--- linux/drivers/block/cfq-iosched.c.orig	
+++ linux/drivers/block/cfq-iosched.c	
Otherwise, cheers! I'll give it a bit of a run and see what numbers come up.
