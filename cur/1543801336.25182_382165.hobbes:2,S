Hi,
	I believe that people had decided not to incorporate this
feature. Basically the IPW2200 will get too many firmware restarts on
rfmon, making the feature unusable. I don't think we want this option at
all so far. (Until there's a valid fix for the problem)

|I have made a stupid copy&paste error: QoS option is named IPW_QOS not 
|IPW2200_MONITOR. Spotted by Daniel Paschka, thanks.
|
|Add the following config entries for the ipw2200 driver to 
|drivers/net/wireless/Kconfig
| * IPW2200_MONITOR
|   enables Monitor mode
| * IPW_QOS
|   enables QoS feature - this is under development right now, 
|so it depends 
|upon EXPERIMENTAL
