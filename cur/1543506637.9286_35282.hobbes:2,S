I'm in France. ISDN is important to some people in a few countries and
these people can either patch and compile their own kernels or let
S.U.S.E. or another ISDN-friendly distributor do it for them.

Certainly, some people would benefit from the inclusion in 2.4 of the new
ISDN code. However, many more would be put at risk. I don't want to see
a repeat of the instability of 2.2.n (where n<12). The 2.1/2.2 development
cycle was less than perfect. Let's try to learn from it and do better in
the future. I think Linus is on the right track with 2.3. The sooner we
have a feature freeze, the better.
