 It's probably required for the i386-timer-broadcast patch from the same
patchset.  Apparently some Intel CPUs stop their local APIC timer when in
certain ACPI C-states, so that patch switches them to use an IPI broadcast
from the main timer interrupt instead.  Supporting subjiffy profiling
is impossible in that case, so the code was removed.
