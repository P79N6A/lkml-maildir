I think we're actually agreeing.  My kmalloc/kzalloc patch is a cute
hack but magic tricks like that aren't going to shrink the kernel by
very much and it's probably not worth merging complications like that.
The way to a smaller kernel is for a lot of people to do a lot of hard
work and look at where we can trim fat.
For your last suggestion, maybe someone can automate running Andi's
bloat-o-meter?  I think the hard part is maintaining comparable configs.
