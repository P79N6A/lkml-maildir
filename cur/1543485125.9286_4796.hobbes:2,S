SO_BINDTODEVICE has been near obsoleted in 2.2 again.  IP_PKTINFO
(when set Linux passes a ip_pktinfo struct as ancillary data that contains
information about the packet, can be used for sending too) usually 
offers a more elegant solution. SO_BINDTODEVICE is nasty because of its
security implications - some versions of linux had holes because of it.

I have nothing against 0.0.0.0 interfaces, but Alexey Kuznetsov is the
man in charge for the IP layer (he rewrote most of it for 2.2) and he has to 
be convinced @)
