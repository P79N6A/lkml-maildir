Maybe I should have made it a bit clearer in my original post to this thread:
the thing is a show-stopper. You can watch a 2.4.21 box drop down its
throughput to somewhere around 2-4 kByte/sec on a 100 MBit/sec switched
network. You have to setup a real routing-environment testbed to notice the
problem. I did not see it using any of the rc's as a simple host with all kinds
of network applications (including high volume nfs), but not routing...
