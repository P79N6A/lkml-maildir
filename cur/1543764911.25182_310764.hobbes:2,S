I agree. We should not skip the home block group of the file.  I guess
what I was suggesting is, if allocation from the home group failed and
we continuing the linear search the rest of block groups, we could
probably try to skip the block groups without enough usable free blocks
to make a reservation. Checking for the number of free blocks left in
the quary bg is a good way, but probably not good enough, since those
free blocks might already being reserved.

Ah.. I see the win with the read lock now: once the a reservation window
is added, updating it (either winding it forward and or searching for a
avaliable window) probably is the majorirty of the operations on the
tree, and using read lock for that should help reduce the latency.
I will work on a patch for Lee to try sometime tonight.
