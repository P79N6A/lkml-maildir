Here are some extra pieces of information regarding what people told me
or recommended me:
  * I am already using UHCI, and not OHCI (in particular, I am using the
    uhci_hcd module);
  * I tried inserting my USB drive slowly, but it seemed to make no
    difference;
  * Before inserting the USB drive, I already have scsi_mod, ide_scsi,
    sd_mod, usbcore and usblp loaded.
The bad thing is that apart from not being able to store my files in my
drive, this process is leaving some unkillable processes in my system as
shows the following excerpt from an execution of the command "ps aux":
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

As a reminder, the last lines of my dmesg output that seems relevant to
the problem is attached to this message. After that, I get the message
that /dev/sda1 is not a valid block device.
I put all the relevant files that I can think of on my homepage, at
<

 for further reference.
Please feel free to ask me whatever you feel is important and I will do
my best to answer to get this working correctly.
Thanks in advance, Rogério Brito.
