I found out that the larger drives use Ultra DMA 66 (WDC) / Ultra DMA 100(IBM); this could be the
problem in ATA-IDE-code; As i think this is a problem now for many harddisks in kernel 2.2.x up and 
i'm sure this one keeps 2.4.x from being running on these drives as well... 
The specification of WDC says that the Ultra DMA 66 can only be switched off by BIOS (so we have to do
this in linux, AFAIK...)
Good Luck!
