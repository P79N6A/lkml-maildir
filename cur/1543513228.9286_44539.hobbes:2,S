It does not. It is just checking when you try to access the device. That is
exactly what happens here now.
But if you factor in hotplugging (this is what all this discussion is
supposed to be about, wasn't it?), the kernel _has_ to know at each instant
what is available and what is not (and any halfway decent PnP hardware
standard will provide notification to the kernel), if only to ask the user
(via some devd as HPA advocates, and which devfs also has) what should be
done with/to the new device.
Don't use dumb hardware (parallel port, serial ports) onto which pluggable
devices (Zip drives, CD writers, parallel IDE, ...) are kludged on for PCs
just because the interface is universally available and the box doesn't
need to be opened for doing this; with real hotplugging, PnP devices (Not
ISA ones. Shame that the concept has been rendered useless by you know
who).
