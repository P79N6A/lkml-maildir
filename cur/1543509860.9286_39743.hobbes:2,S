I'm running with it now.  It may help some, but it's hard to tell.
The XMMS processes run less than 5.0 percent some of the time, but
they still spike much higher, up to 15 percent or so.  When they spike
higher, they stay high for a while, then come back down after a minute
or so.
Running UP, they never spike up like that.
My kernel is the mandrake helios version, which I think is the same as
2.2.13pre7.  Here are all the Andrea patches I have applied to it:
