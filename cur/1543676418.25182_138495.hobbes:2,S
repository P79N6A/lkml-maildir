Subject: Is there a bug with su, and /dev/std*?

	I was writing a script that writes to /dev/error, and I'm experiencing odd behavior.  This is with a 2.4.18 kernel.
	I login to an account, 'jcw'.
	[jcw@drive jcw]$ echo test_msg >/dev/error
        test_msg
	[jcw@drive jcw]$ su - slimedr
        Password:
        [slimedr@drive jcw]$ echo test_msg >/dev/error
	bash: /dev/stderr: Permission denied
	As user 'jcw' we see
	[jcw@drive jcw]$ ls -l /dev/stderr
	lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           17 Mar 11 15:28 /dev/stderr -> ../proc/self/fd/2
	[jcw@drive jcw]$ ls -l /proc/self/fd/2
	lrwx------    1 jcw      jcw            64 Jun  6 17:31 /proc/self/fd/2 -> /dev/pts/5
	
	As user 'slimedr' we see
	[slimedr@drive slimedr]$ ls -l /dev/stderr
	lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           17 Mar 11 15:28 /dev/stderr -> ../proc/self/fd/2
	[slimedr@drive slimedr]$ ls -l /proc/self/fd/2
	lrwx------    1 slimedr  slimedr        64 Jun  6 17:34 /proc/self/fd/2 -> /dev/pts/5
	So what gives?  Shouldn't the user context change with 'su -' allow me to write to /dev/stderr and /dev/stdout?
