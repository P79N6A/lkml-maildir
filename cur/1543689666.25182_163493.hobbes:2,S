No, no!  Force a read() _after_ all the dirty buffers are flushed to the 
disk.

I assume you're kidding... :-)

No, I _do_ want exactly what I asked for.  Actually, I would really like a 
bit more: to ask the disk drive to read from its media rather than its 
cache.  But I'll settle for bypassing the O/S's cache.

Not if there is a bad sector that causes a read error.

I'm assuming there aren't other writers.  It doesn't really matter if 
there are.  I don't care _what_ data is on the disk; I just want to know 
that it is _readable_ without getting hardware errors.

Yes.  It's an imperfect world.
