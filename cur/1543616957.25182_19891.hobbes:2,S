I can send you some numbers.  It is typically 5-10% throughput increase
under load.  Obviously this work won't help a single task on a single
user system.  But things like (ack!) dbench 16 show a marked
improvement.

I have an explanation.  We can schedule quicker off a woken task.  When
an event occurs that allows an I/O-blocked task to run, its time-to-run
is shorter.  Same event/response improvement that helps interactivity.
