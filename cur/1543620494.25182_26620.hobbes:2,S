Subject: [PATCH: NEW ARCHITECTURE FOR 2.5.3] support for NCR voyager
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is essentially the same as the 2.5.2 patch except that it adds support 
for the new migration cross processor interrupt.
As far as the new scheduler goes, the process affinity properties are much 
better for the voyager, which is configured to have a fairly huge L3 cache 
shared by several CPUs.  (My current voyager has 2 CPU cards with 4 pentium 
CPUs each and 32Mb of L3 cache on each card).
The patch (157k) is available here
http://www.hansenpartnership.com/voyager/files/voyager-2.5.3.diff
If there's any interest from the other architecture groups, I can also put 
together the incremental diff between 2.5.2 and 2.5.3 which shows what changes 
needed to be made in the arch specific boot sequence and smp code for the new 
scheduler.
