Subject: [RFC][PATCH] cleanup file.h and INIT_TASK a bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patches does a couple of things: first off, it removes the sched.h 
include from file.h that was added recently, as we really don't need yet 
another include file chain mess.  To make this a bit more palatable, a 
few of the inlines are moved out of file.h and into fcntl.c, plus the 
files_struct is moved to file.h from sched.h.  Since this meant adding 
file.h to the various arch/*/kernel/init_task.c files, I took the time 
to move the INIT_* bits for initializing the init task out of sched.h 
and into init_task.h.  If this is okay, please apply the patch.  There 
are other cleanups to do if people are interested: the #define for init_task 
is currently duplicated in *all* asm-*/processor.h files to be exactly 
the same thing...  This is a way of testing the waters on include file 
cleanups.  Done properly, they shave ~10-15% off of the kernel compile 
time on my machine.
Oh, the file.h cleanup exposed a mess (bug): usb.c was duplicating code 
from daemonize().
