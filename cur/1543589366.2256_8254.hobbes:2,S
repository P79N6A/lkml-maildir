Nope, it's a benign side-effect of the order of evaluation of command-line
switches.  Here's what's happening:
1. X86=y is being set and frozen.
2. ISA=y is deduced from X86
3. config.out is read in.  
In step 3, you don't see any side effects from config.out because they
were calculated last time and wruitten into the saved configuration. 
You still see the ISA=y message because your config.out has not yet been
read in at the time that side effect is computed.
