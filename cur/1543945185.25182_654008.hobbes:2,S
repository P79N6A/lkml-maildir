On my test machine, there is EFI runtime memory area with EFI_MEMORY_UC
attribute. The following is cut from the dmesg:
EFI: mem75: type=4, attr=0xf, range=[0x000000007f4ff000-0x000000007f500000) (0MB)
EFI: mem76: type=11, attr=0x8000000000000001, range=[0x00000000fed1c000-0x00000000fed20000) (0MB)
EFI: mem77: type=11, attr=0x8000000000000001, range=[0x00000000fffb0000-0x00000000fffb4000) (0MB)
Where:
attr is md->attribute,
#define EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME 0x8000000000000000
#define EFI_MEMORY_UC 0x0000000000000001
But because end_pfn_map contains the above UC memory area, efi_ioremap()
is not used on EFI 64.
