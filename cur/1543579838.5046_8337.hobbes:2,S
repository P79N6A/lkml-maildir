Is it still a problem even we never access the memory through the non-UCWC
memory?

That sounds like an incredible amount of work!  Are you going to support this
in your code?  I wouldn't even know how to begin implementing that.

Ok, so what are you going to provide?  All I need is a method to access a
particular physical page, whether it's part of real RAM or not, in an UCWC
manner.  Can you give me a hint as to how that cability can be provided?
