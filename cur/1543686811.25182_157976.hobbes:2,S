Subject: [PATCH] PowerPC consistent_free() didn't free physical, just virtual (fixed)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

consistent_free() was only freeing the virtual addresses before.
This actually frees the virtual address and physical pages now.
The hacked "track" array allows us to keep track of the
address/order tuple so consistent_free() knows how large the area
was without passing it in (and changing the arity of the function).
I discovered this by using consistent_alloc() and consistent_free() several
times.  Eventually, there was no RAM was left and instead of returning an
error consistent_alloc() panics.
