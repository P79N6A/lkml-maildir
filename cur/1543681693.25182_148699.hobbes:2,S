Hi.
A number of people have experienced the same problem as I have; the VESA
framebuffer is just..black on boot. I haven't seen any reports on this,
though. dmesg says what it always have said before about the fb.
I boot with vga=791 (as specified in lilo.conf).. Have something changed
or is it just broken? :o)
Thanks.
