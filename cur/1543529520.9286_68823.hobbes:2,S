compiling isa ne2000 as module, can't load it
 modprobe ne
/lib/modules/2.3.51/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol ei_open
/lib/modules/2.3.51/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol ethdev_init
/lib/modules/2.3.51/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol ei_interrupt
/lib/modules/2.3.51/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol NS8390_init
/lib/modules/2.3.51/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol ei_close
the 8390.o gets compiled but not installed, 
ei_* doesn't show up in makelog at all
all was well in 2.3.49, build 2.3.50 broke in many ways, i skipped it
am i doing something wrong/silly?
it's an smp kernel btw.
