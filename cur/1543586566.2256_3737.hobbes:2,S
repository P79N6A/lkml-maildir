You can do it that way too

It could be a different device each boot too. Who is doing the bus
enumeration in a constant manner.

There are a very large number of reasons you need them and things that depend
on constant numbering for block devices such as backup tools. They can Im sure
be taught constant naming, but there is no provision for names not device ids
in them.
Things like tar will no longer work on Linux for example because tar does not
know how to archive the name of a device node.

devfs solves a different problem - enumeration of dynamically configured 
resources. Its unrelated to the fundamental problem.
