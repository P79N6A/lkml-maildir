The udelay limit is set a lot lower than 100mS. It has to be somewhat lower
otherwise you have to do two levels of loops which will throw small udelay
timings a fair whack.

Sounds like a compiler bug.
#define udelay(n) (__builtin_constant_p(n) ? \
	((n) > 20000 ? __bad_udelay() : __const_udelay((n) * 0x10c6ul)) : \
	__udelay(n))
non constants are covered.
