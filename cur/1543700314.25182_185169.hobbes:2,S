  Hi!
 The following is happening when using 2.6: I've got two network interface
cards: SMC Ultra (ISA PNP card) and an Intel eepro100 card. The strange
thing is that both of these cards get the eth0 interface. Relative to
dmesg:
...
loop: loaded (max 8 devices)

smc-ultra.c: No ISAPnP cards found, trying standard ones...

So you can see there is only one eth interface for two NICs.
Modules are turned off, and ISAPnP is enabled.
Cheers,
