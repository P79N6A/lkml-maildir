I don't know what module you're talking about, but surely there must be  
something that could be done kernel-side to protect against such problems.  
Reference counting or such like? I guess if it was a hardware issue, but  
then again that might be an issue with too many assumptions being made  
about prior state? Maybe I am being too naive :>

Now I see your point. Of course my previous point about patches is still  
valid though: the tainted flag only gives part of the picture. The person  
reporting the bug might create just as much of a black box for us by  
forgetting to mention that they applied patch foobar.
Regards,
Nigel
