there are 3 "generic" components needed right now to clean up all time 
related stuff: GTOD, ktimers and clockevents. [you know the first two, 
and clockevents is new code from Thomas Gleixner that generalizes timer 
interrupts and introduces one compact notion for 'clock chips'.]
what is the point? Ontop of these, a previously difficult feature, High 
Resolution Timers became _massively_ simpler. All of these patches exist 
together in the -rt tree, so it's not handwaving. The same will be the 
case for idle ticks / dynamic ticks [we started with HRT because it is 
so much harder than idle ticks]. So i do agree with you that GTOD needs 
more work, but it also makes time related features all that much easier.
right now it's GTOD that needs the most work before it can be merged 
upstream, so you picked the right one to criticise :-)
