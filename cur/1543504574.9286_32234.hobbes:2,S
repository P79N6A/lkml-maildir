IMHO gas 16-bit use will be inconvenient for a while... my RH 6.0 box
uses gas 2.9.1, so older systems will be even worse.

nasm is nice, for all the reasons you mention above.  The only
overriding concern is that as86 works, and assemblers for 16-bit x86
targets don't need to be updated very often :)
