The good news is that the Gnome session log-in progresses to the point
where both top and bottom bars are painted (gray) and the bottom bar
is populated with icons (2.6.21-rc7 vanilla stops after displaying the
splash).  The bad news is that it stops there.
Big-copy fails as well, after 2.5G transferred.
The process traces are at:
