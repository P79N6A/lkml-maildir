Speaking of compilers, may I ask a quick question here?  Personally,
I use the Red Hat distro.  I've noticed in 6.0 gcc has been replaced
with egcs.  I've also found parameters in the egcs docs that allow
compiling with different Intel instruction sets, up through the
Pentium Pro.  Would it not be benefical to take a moment and detect
whether the compiler is egcs or not and set appropriate -march and
-mcpu flags to make use of these instruction sets if the compiler
offers them?  Last time I checked in the 2.2.10 source tree, -m486
was still being used for *ALL* intel processors above the 386.  Why
would I want my kernel running with a 486 instruction set when I have
a Pentium Pro?  It just makes sense to use the Pentium Pro
instruction set since the compiler DOES provide that.  And perhaps
similar modifications can be made to support instruction sets for
other processors where applicable.
Am I totally out of line here?
Kevin

2.7.3 is more picky about exactly where you put your attributes, and I
have it fixed now (so yes, 2.7.3 will be supported still, it's just that
I
hadn't been too careful..)
