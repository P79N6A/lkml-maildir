While mounting an NFS export, I got this on my UDB:
portmap: RPC call returned error 61
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
portmap: RPC call returned error 61
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
lockd_up: makesock failed, error=-61
portmap: RPC call returned error 61
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
The UDB's "/" is NFS-mounted from the same PC that this mount attempt was
for.  The mount succeeded after a few seconds.
Tim.
