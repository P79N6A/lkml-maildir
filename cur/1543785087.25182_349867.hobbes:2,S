I don't like that at all.  The implementation of its tests is necessarily
imprecise, but nonetheless, we do prefer primitives which atomically test
and reserve.  We're not moving from request_region to check_region, are we?
But change the naming by all means, it was never good,
and grew worse when "security_" got stuck on the front.
