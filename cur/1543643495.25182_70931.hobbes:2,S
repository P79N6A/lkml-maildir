You are hereby invited to debug the DAC960 driver.  Making the needed
changes only took a few hours to get it to the point where it initializes,
now it oopses in the interrupt handler, because I did the bio part wrong.
Of course, you might not make any mistakes, but you probably will, so get
ready with your printks.  It's going to take you a while, I can assure
you.
I flat out refuse to do this without kgdb.
