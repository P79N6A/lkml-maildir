German,
I don't understand why trying to access a scanner on id=5
would cause bus resets on id=0 (but I have seen reports that
the aic7xxx driver is prone to bus resets).
However I do know there are problems with the Agfa Snapscan
driver in SANE working together with the sg driver. See web site:
http://www.torque.net/sg
  [follow link to faq]
for a new SANE backend for that scanner and see if that
fixes your problem.
