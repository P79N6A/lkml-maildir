Or a machine check on some architectures which make you know that 
they don't like a bus cycle which terminates on a master abort.

The major problem I see is that using up 256 Mb of kernel virtual address 
space for accessing PCI config space is gross. Besides that it won't
work for 32 bit machines with 768 Mb of RAM or more.
I believe that it would be better to use kmap/kunmap like tricks, especially 
for something which is relatively infrequent. You could even reserve
a fixmap entry for this and keep somewhere a pointer to the PTE, which 
would be modified on every config space access (config space access was
already properly serialized last time I looked, I believe that all you need 
is a TLB flush after the PTE is updated).
I have no strong opinion on how to handle 64 bit archs.

Here I'm somehwat lost. Writes to uncacheable RAM will be in program 
order and never combined. The bridge itself should not post writes to 
config space. So it's a matter of pushing the write to the processor
bus, a PCI read looks very heavy for this. Isn't there a more
lightweight solution ?
