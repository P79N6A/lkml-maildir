Hi all...
I have seen a very strange thing. 
I was trying hdparm -tT on a SATA disk, it did the buffered part OK,
and hanged my box in the non-buffered measure. After waiting some minutes,
I did a SysRQ-s-u-b, and the the disk began to give many read errors on
sectors and could not boot because journal was not present and many other
errors.
After some warm and cold boots, finally the box came up correctly.
I suspect that something that hdparm did left my disk dumb. But what ?
I will keep away from hdparm for some time...
Any idea ?
TIA
