Interestingly, the current version of utrace makes no special provision
for watchpoints, either in kernel or user space.  Instead it relies on the
legacy ptrace mechanism for setting debug registers in the target
process's user area.  Perhaps an explicit watchpoint implementation should
be added to utrace, but that's beyond the scope of this discussion.
Furthermore, utrace is explicitly intended for tracing user programs, not
for tracing the kernel.  Kwatch, however, is just the opposite: It is
intended for setting up watchpoints in kernel space.  In that sense it is
pretty much orthogonal to utrace.  Although it would affect the utrace
patches, the changes would be basically transparent (i.e., move the new
code from one ptrace handler to another instead of moving the old code).
If Kwatch is to be subsumed anywhere, I think it should be under the
Kprobes/Systemtap project.  Again, that's a separate question -- so far 
they have avoided data watchpoints.
