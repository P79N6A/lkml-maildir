Between 2.6.28 and 2.6.28.1 you changed the function grab_cache_page to grab_cache_page_write_begin and added a flags argument. Since I maintain an separate filesystem module I need to take care of this.
From the change log:

    fs: symlink write_begin allocation context fix
    commit 54566b2c1594c2326a645a3551f9d989f7ba3c5e upstream.
Change grab_cache_page to
    accept a nofs argument as well, to honour that flag (while we're there,
    change the name to grab_cache_page_write_begin which is more instructive
    and does away with random leading underscores).
