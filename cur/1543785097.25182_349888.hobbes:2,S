By "SCSI susbsystem" I refer to: all active ULDs, the
mid level, the active LLDs and associated parts of the
block subsystem. Given that, what is "not true at all"?
Strangely, James Bottomley replied to the same
line with: "Right, but we've already moved away ..."

I am proposing the minimalist option. That is, nothing in
the SCSI (kernel) subsystem (including the LLD) does discovery
at either the transport or the lu level. I'm not suggesting
that should be the default setting.
Can you remember when doing device discovery in the user
space was discussed on this list? I thought that people felt
that it was a worthwhile goal. To do it at least
the following is needed:
  1) a way to stop the SCSI subsystem doing it
  2) tools to allow the user space to do it, or,
     skip discovery, address the device directly
That way, if a user app wants to talk to a well know lu (or
whatever), it doesn't matter if the mid level or the LLD
in question decides that it is not a good idea to make it
visible. LLDs know about their transport but not what is
behind a target device, especially if it is a bridge.
Of course, an LLD could have a backdoor through to the user
space to accomplish this ...

You seem to suggest that I am pining after something in the
past. You make the point that a one-fits-all discovery ("i"
and "l") in the mid level is not a good idea; better to
let the LLD do it (or have the option). I make the further
point that a user app might be even better placed.
