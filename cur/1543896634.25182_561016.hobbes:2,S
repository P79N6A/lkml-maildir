No the "incomplete" mediation does not flow from the design.  We have
deliberately focused on doing the necessary modifications for pathname
based mediation.  The IPC and network mediation are a wip.
We have never claimed to be using pathname-based mediation IPC or networking.
The "natural abstraction" approach does generize well enough and will
be analyzable.

yes of course, we realize that dbus and X must be trusted applications,
this to will happen.  But it will happen piece meal, something about
releasing early and often comes to mind.

Actually it can be analyzed and shown.  It is ugly to do and we
currently don't have a tool capable of doing it, but it is possible.
