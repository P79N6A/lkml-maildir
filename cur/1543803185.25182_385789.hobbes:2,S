It's much more convenient to do it dynamically (and saves you a reboot).
Just do
# echo deadline > /sys/block/dev/queue/scheduler
to switch it at runtime, replace 'dev' with your hard drive name, eg
hda or sda etc.
BTW, that option needs updating, you are supposed to use "anticipatory"
for that scheduler (patch accepted :-).
