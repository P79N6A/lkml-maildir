To quote "Linux Kernel Development" (Which I am currently reading):
Work queues defer work into a kernel thread-the work always runs in process
context. Most importantly, work queues are schedulable and can therefore sleep.
Normally, there is little decision between work queues or sotftirqs/tasklets.
If the deferred work need to sleep, work queues are used. If the deferred 
work need not sleepa, softirqs or tasklets are used.
[end quote]
Hope this helped :)
