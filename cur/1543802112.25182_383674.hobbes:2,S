Do I smell a bug wrt CPU Hotplug here? Basically, I see that we do
a rcu_move_batch of ->curlist and ->nxtlist of the dead CPU. Why not
->donelist? If we have to do a rcu_move_batch of ->donelist also,
then perhaps the ->donelist != NULL check is required in
rcu_pending? This is considering that the RCU tasklet of the dead
CPU is killed (rather than moved over to a different CPU).
