Hi All,
First I did not tried 2.5.73 vanilla so this can be a bug in 2.5.73 itself . 
When I use my 56k modem to connect to internet it always hang up 5-6 minutes 
( sometimes like 1-2 minutes ) later. I checked with 2.5.72-mm1 and I got not 
hang-up whatsoever. I checked system logs and it just says :
[pppd] Modem Hang Up
Anyone noticed this behaviour?
Regards,
