Not quoted because patch isn't inlined, but you're testing for the 
presence of the batch_write pointer repeatedly in the loop. How about 
declare a batch_write ptr on the stack and then do your test once, outside 
of your do { } while (count) loop, and then set it to the generic method 
(before entering the loop) if the generic method isn't available?
Thanks,
Chase
