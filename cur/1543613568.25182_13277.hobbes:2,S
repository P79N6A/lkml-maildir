Thanks.  I was not aware of this flag and this is a nice tip.
Unfortunately things lock up immediately before effects of this flag
can be felt.  Even with this I am not getting a single line from
a kernel. I tried both on 1500 and 1100.  Effects are exactly the same.
Tommorow I will try to graft 'arch/alpha' from 2.4.13-ac8 to 2.4.17rc1
just to see what will happen.  Some changes have to be made before this
will even compile.  I see that some 'nautilus_init()' function showed up
in 2.4.17rc1 which was not in 2.4.13-ac8.  Hm....
I did boot 2.4.13-ac8 on UP1500 but in a short order I collected an
impressive array of "Machine checks" both "Fatal", although machine was
still running to an extent after that, and "Correctable".  If somebody
wants to look at them I can oblige. :-)  Nothing of that sort showed up
on UP1100 with the same kerel or with older kernels I was able to boot
on 1500.
