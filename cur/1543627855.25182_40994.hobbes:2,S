In 2.5, there is the system call sched_setaffinity.  It is rather new so
your libraries do not support it - see example code and headers at:
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/cpu-affinity
For 2.4, there is not yet such an interface.  At the above URL, you can
find a proc-based and a syscall-based interface for setting and
retrieving affinity.
