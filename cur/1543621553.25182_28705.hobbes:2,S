Subject: How do I get the ALSA code in 2.5.5-pre1 working?

Hello,
I have the linux hotplug scripts installed.  When I built
the drivers as modules, they did not autoload, as they should
have.  Are you working to make the drivers register themselves
during the boot process so that they are autoloaded without
having to hack the modules.conf file?
I have applied the patch the gets /proc/asound working.
In my most recent attempt, I have compiled the ALSA drivers
into the kernel.  I would like to use the native ALSA drivers,
but am not sure how to configure my devices to make this
happen.  I use esound on GNOME and play CDs.
One question I have is how to go about getting the ALSA
utilities and tools to build.  They require alsa-lib, which
appears to require alsa-drivers.  This is a problem, because
I don't want to install the out-of-kernel ALSA drivers in
addition to the in-kernel ones.
It seems to me that there is a need for several things to happen,
now that ALSA is in the development kernel:
1)  You need to update your web documentation to guide users
in configuring ALSA who are testing the ALSA support in
the development kernel.
2)  You need to include updated ALSA configuration and usage
information into the linux/Documentation tree in the 2.5 kernel
tree.
3)  You need to update documentation in the utils and tools
packages to include information about how to build and use
there utilies when using the 2.5 kernel drivers.
4)  You may need to overhaul your tools and utilities build
processes so that alsa-drivers is not required.
Here are my options:
CONFIG_SND=y
CONFIG_SND_RTCTIMER=y
CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER=y
CONFIG_SND_OSSEMUL=y
CONFIG_SND_MIXER_OSS=y
CONFIG_SND_PCM_OSS=y
CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER_OSS=y
CONFIG_SND_DEBUG=y
CONFIG_SND_DEBUG_MEMORY=y
CONFIG_SND_DEBUG_FULL=y
CONFIG_SND_DEBUG_DETECT=y
CONFIG_SND_EMU10K1=y
In my kernel log, I see no sign that my EMU10K1 card is detected.
Here is what an OSS driver in an earlier kernel logged when it
detected my card:
