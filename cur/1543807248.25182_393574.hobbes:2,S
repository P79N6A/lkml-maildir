I'm unable to find any reference to SERIO_I8042_XL.
$ cat .git/HEAD

$ grep -r I8042_XL .

The driver does not check that the device behaves as a normal mouse.
It would be relatively straight forward to implement this feature, but
since psmouse already does this, this behaviour would be a major
benefit to moving the Liyitec driver into psmouse.

The Liyitec packet is always a legal PS/2 packet. However, the
overflow bits are used as the tenth bits of precision of the absolute
X and Y coordinates, and so are set far more often than on a normal
PS/2 mouse, assuming the user touches the bottom right corner of the
screen.

Okay. I'll do that then. How is the module parameter specified for a
driver that's compiled into the kernel?
Cheers,
