The 2.5 kernel must be buildable on gcc-2.91.66, aka egcs-1.1.2.
The 2.95.x requirement was reverted because sparc (or sparc64?)
needs egcs-1.1.2.
__func__ does *not* work on egcs-1.1.2 and so cannot be used in Linux.
`struct blah = { .open = driver_open };' *does* work in egcs-1.1.2
and is OK to use.
