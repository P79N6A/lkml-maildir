There's no need for sarcasm.  No, they are not guesses.  Ask Ben 
Herrenschmidt if you don't believe me.

Because the code needs to synchronize not with another CPU, but with a USB 
host controller.  Those barriers are necessary even on a UP system.
By the way, what's the idea with this proliferation of little
not-all-that-helpful routines, like smp_mb__before_clear_bit()?  Are there
architectures on which
	smp_mb__before_clear_bit(...);
is significantly superior to
	smp_mb();
	clear_bit(...);
?  (It's certainly not easier to type.)  Is this difference worth noting,
considering how infrequently clear_bit() gets used?
