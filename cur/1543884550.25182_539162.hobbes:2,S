Oh crap.  It's back.
I don't know what's different from before,
but the system now locks up again exactly the same way,
even with the lock contention fix applied.
With or without CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y in the config.
I've gotta get some work done here (this is my primary development machine),
so it's back to CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP=y for a while.
If anyone has a patch to dump out state/whatever just before that
last message that preceeds all lockups, then pass it along and
I'll queue it up for testing as soon as I can.
Cheers
