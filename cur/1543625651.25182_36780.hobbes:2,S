Im not an IDE coder, but I've had to work through your IDE code before now,
and its fugly.
Im not a violent man, but I suspect if I ever met you the only respect
you'd see from me would come from the toe of my boot and leave through your
throat.
Your attitude to the programmers trying to WORK on the ide code frankly
disgusts me.
I dont like to speak out like this, but I feel I must. Sorry to anyone on
LKML who has /real/ hacking to do.
