Not what I meant.

I'm more focused on this sort of security.  Finding and fixing bugs is
important, but protecting against the exploitation of certain classes of
bugs is also a major step forward.

Yeah I noticed.  I'm trying to grep through the grsecurity megapatch and
write an LSM clone (stackable already) based on those hooks to
reimplement GrSecurity, as an academic learning experience.  I try to
make something functional at each step (I did linking restrictions
first), but it's hard to find everything in that gargantuant thing
related to a specific feature :)
That being said, you should also consider (unless somebody forgot to
tell me something) that it takes two source trees to make a split-out
patch.  The author also has to chew down everything but the feature he
wants to split out.  I could probably log 10,000 man-hours splitting up
GrSecurity.  :)

true. Very very true.
With things like Gr, there's like a million features.  Normally the
first step I take is "Disable it all".  If it still breaks, THEN THERE'S
A PROBLEM.  If it works, then the binary searching begins.

Wasn't talking about bugfixes, see above.

Lots of work to split up a patch though.
