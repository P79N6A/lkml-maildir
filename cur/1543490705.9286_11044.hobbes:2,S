yes, you can use the IKD ('Integrated Kernel Debugging') patch, but maybe
the solution is simpler than that:

One important kernel programming rule, at most ~7K should be used as stack
variables. (~4k on 2.0, thus a good guideline is to never allocate more
than 3k). Most probably the problem is that you allocate some big
structure on the kernel stack: 
myioctl ()
{
	char buff [10000];
	....
}
use kmalloc() instead.
if you cannot find it, then you can use IKD which has a small extension
called 'stack status monitor', which simply saves the function's address
that used the most stackspace. (/proc/stack_monitor, or something like
that). Then you can work down all those functions that use too much stack.
