Whether or not it's legal to post it is something else, that doesn't
make it right. Besides, in many countries you can't put someone's name
up on a billboard unless they have agreed to it, or if they are
considered a 'public person' or something to that extend. Of course
with the totally broken privacy system in the US, and Canada for that
safe ;-(, I am sure you can publish whatever you want.
I have no issue with a company like BM or anyone else using anonymous
statistics for advertisement, but I'd be royally pissed if I had my
name on someone's leaflet without having given my written permission
first. Hence the suggestion for a privacy clause in the license.
Cheers,
Jes
