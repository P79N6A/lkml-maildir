Ingo,
the last fix survived one night of testing with included udelay(100), so
I would consider it stable. Thanks again!
The performance with the new "complex" macros is as expected worse than
with the simple ones, we see 10% in some cases, which is hurting a lot.
Would you please consider moving the location of the switch_lock from
the end of the task_struct to the hot area near the scheduler related
variables? The effect may vary depending on the cache line size but
having it behind *array or sleep_timestamp would probably save us a cache
miss here.
Regards,
Erich
