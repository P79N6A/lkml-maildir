long time ago (1 Jul 1996) Paul Gortmaker <gpg109@rsphysse.anu.edu.au> 
mailed a script called `kprune' which just did that (first run
`make config dep' and then `kprune').  he mentioned that URL, no idea if it's still valid:
        
http://rsphy1.anu.edu.au/~gpg109/kprune
at the down side of `pruned' kernel sources, applying new patches is a PITA :-(
