If these machines are P4-based, then I bet they do have local APICs.
However, if the BIOS boots the kernel with the local APIC disabled
on a P4, we (apic.c) don't try to enable it. The logic behind that
is that "modern" BIOSen _should_ boot with it enabled, unless they're
horribly broken.
So apply the patch below and try the "can we get the machine to hang"
checklist again.
