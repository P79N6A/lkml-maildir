But multiple drivers for the same device are allowed on other buses
like PCI.  I think this is no reason to prohibit the multiple platform
drivers for the same platform device.
Though, I think the snd-pcsp driver could be better built on the top
of input pcspkr driver, or coexist with it.  Then we'll have no more
conflict about platform name space.
When you compare input pcspkr.c and sound pcsp_input.c, you can find
that most of codes are identical.  What we'd need is a hook on
pcspkr.c that adds a dynamic check whether snd-pcsp (or any ohter)
is running.
thanks,
