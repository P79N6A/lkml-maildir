Actually, I'm pretty sure you _never_ need to exportvg in order to have
it work on another system.  That's one of the great things about AIX LVM,
because it means you can move a VG to another system after a hardware
problem, and not have any problems importing it (journaled fs also helps).
AFAIK, the only think exportvg does is remove VG information from the
ODM and /etc/filesystems.
I suppose it is possible that because AIX is so tied into the ODM and
SMIT, that it updates the VGDA mountpoint info whenever a filesystem
mountpoint is changed, but this will _never_ work on Linux because of
different tools versions, distributions, etc.  Also, it would mean on
AIX that anyone editing /etc/filesystems might have a broken system at
vgimport time (wouldn't be the first time that not using ODM/SMIT caused
such a problem).

Yes, even though it would tie the user into using a specific version of
mount(), I suppose it is a better solution than storing it inside the
filesystem.  It will work with non-ext2 filesystems, and it also allows
you to store more information than simply the mountpoint (e.g. mount
options, dump + fsck info, etc).  In the end, I will probably just
save the whole /etc/fstab line into the LV header somewhere, and extract
it at importvg time (possibly with modifications for vgname and mountpoint).
Cheers, Andreas
