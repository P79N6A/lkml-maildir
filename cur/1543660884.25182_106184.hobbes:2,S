Er, if vermagic.o needed to change, then your module build was broken
already and wouldn't have worked against the precompiled kernel. That's 
what vermagic.o is there for. You shouldn't need write permissions to the 
kernel source tree. Neither do you need _all_ of the kernel source; 
just the headers and appropriate bits of infrastructure.
