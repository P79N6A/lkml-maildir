With my compiler (gcc 4.0.2 from FC4), it's the "unlikely" construct
that confuses the gcc warning logic, not the inlining. I get the
warning if I compile the following code with "gcc -Wall -O2 -S
test.c":
	int f(int x)
	{
		int a;
		int b = 0;
		if (x) {
			a = 1;
			b = 1;
		}
		if (__builtin_expect(!b, 0))
			return 0;
		return a;
	}
However, removing the __builtin_expect makes the warning go away.
Interestingly, changing the source so that a is initialized to some
value will make the warning go away without changing the compiled
code. Apparently, the compiler eventually realizes that the initial
value of a is never used, but it realizes it after deciding if the
warning should be generated.
