I'm running 2.2.1 with the following SCSI controller and tape drive:
scsi0 : Adaptec AHA274x/284x/294x (EISA/VLB/PCI-Fast SCSI) 5.1.10/3.2.4
       <Adaptec AIC-7880 Ultra SCSI host adapter>
Drive:
  Vendor: ARCHIVE   Model: Python 28388-XXX  Rev: 5.53
Using tar to run a backup out to the drive, after an hour or so, the whole
machine freezes solid. No kernel oops or SCSI errors. It's frozen so bad,
that even a hard reset does not get the tape drive out of a locked up
state. The only thing that gets it working again is to power the system
off.
The same hardware configuration was working fine with 2.0.36.
