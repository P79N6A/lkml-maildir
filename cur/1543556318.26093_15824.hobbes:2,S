A while ago, I started working on the Mother Of All compatmac.h files,
trying to merge Don Becker's stuff, yours, David Hinds, and stuff
from my own Comedi package.  It quickly got out of control, as
including compatmac.h (or kern_compat.h, as I called it) would
include most of the include/linux directory.  I've since settled for
setting up a separate include/linux tree with header files
named pci.h, mm.h, etc., that #define the right things and then
do an #include_next.  Interested parties can find it in Comedi
(
