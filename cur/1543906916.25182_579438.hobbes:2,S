Currently this namespace is a work in progress marked with CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
because it is very much still experimental and under development.
There may be other omissions but the one I am most aware of is that
the in kernel user and group equality comparisons have not become been
transformed from the form uid1 == uid2 to user_namespace1 == user_namespace2 &&
uid1 == uid2.
Until that happens that user namespace remains incomplete and not very
useful.  So the advice to users for now that unless they want to help
finish this up do not use.
