What the hell do you mean "these files are not Unix files"???  They do
have universally understood semantics - persistent named array of characters.
That's what Unix files _are_.

Yes, and...?  From what I've seen in this thread that's precisely what
these .lnk files are in Windows.  You would have a point if Windows
kernel would handle them as Unix kernel handles symlinks.  It doesn't.
Some libraries know how to parse them.  Which means "plain files", no
matter how you turn it.
