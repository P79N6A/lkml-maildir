It found a few leaks not found by static code analysis (not many though)
but I mainly tested it on small embedded systems. I think it may be
better to include it in the -mm tree for a while so that more people
test it before deciding whether to merge it into mainline.
FYI, here are some past reports:

I'm a bit biased to comment on the usefulness of kmemleak :-). Anyway,
AFAIK static code checking tools (like coverity) are good for relatively
simple things like not freeing on an error return path (maybe they can
go further across multiple files, I haven't tried it). I doubt such
tools can catch leaks caused by incorrect reference counting or very
complex code. OTOH, kmemleak doesn't report a leak unless it occurred,
so static and dynamic checking tools are rather complementary.
Now, as long as the code is correctly written and with additional static
checking, kmemleak shouldn't find a significant number of bugs. However,
some (earlier) bugs mentioned above were causing tens of (small) leaks
in a few minutes. They may have become visible after days of running but
it's much easier to catch and fix them early.
You can't really tell whether a leak is serious or not until you check
the code. A leak doesn't necessarily mean that you can no longer reuse a
block of memory but the code possibly frees a different one still in use
by other parts of the kernel (e.g. the last report mentioned above).
