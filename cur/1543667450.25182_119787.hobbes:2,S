No, I just think we have different definitions of "mergeable" ;-)

Right ... looking at more recent stuff would be the way to go.

Sure, it can always be a separate fork. I just hate all the duplicated
effort that's going on right now.

Mmmm ... not sure what that says about the vendor kernels ;-) I have a more
"if it works, use it" attitude to the 2.4 tree ... IMHO, I'd like to see
the mainline 2.4 tree be more pragmatic, and 2.5 do "the right thing". As
long as the development tree is clean, it seems maintainable on a long term
basis to me. 
But I'm well aware that that's in disagreement with others ... having a
separate "common-vendor" tree is probably the right thing to do. People
will just argue about that instead though ...proably needs one for the
intersection of the "workstation" trees, and one for the intersection of the
"enterprise" trees. Getting all the vendors basing off it is obviously
pretty important too ;-)
