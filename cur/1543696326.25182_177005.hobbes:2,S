The thing is, that simple patch does NOT solve the problem, as Mark
already noted. Why? Because while it makes "try_to_waker_up()" do the
rigth thing, it doesn't make "wake_up_process_kick()" do the right thing.
The "mask" argument isn't supported by "wake_up_process_kick()", so the
_caller_ has to do
	if (mask & state)
		wake_up_process_kick()
so now you have _another_ case where the kicking isn't done (in the 
caller).
That's why I think the whole interface is scrogged, and why the "simpler" 
patch is not very workable.

This seems to work for me, and I obviously agree with it. I'll have to 
think for a bit whether I can call this an important enough bug to care 
for 2.6.0, since it's only a performance regression. 
(It _looks_ obvious enough, but can you check that there are no pointers
that we might be following in the "is it running" checks that could be
stale because we don't hold the runqueue lock any more).
