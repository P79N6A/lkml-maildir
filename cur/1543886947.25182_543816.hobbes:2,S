It is more readable for you, and more readable on me while in desktop
X. But on Zaurus and on console I see "???C", and I definitely prefer
"degrees C" to _that_.
And I'm clearly not alone.

Common denominator should be used. That includes 80 columns.

Yes, something that cafe driver breaks... it identifies to userland as
"caf???"... but that's another story.
I'd add that variable names must be 7bit ASCII.

Yes, but it would be better to avoid it.. and guessing is much harder
for ???V case (same driver).
I do not think using comments people can actually _read_ is that much
to ask.
