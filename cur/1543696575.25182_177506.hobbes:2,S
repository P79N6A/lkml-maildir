>I've only created a 2.4.20 patch;...
I seem to remember there was a bug for the 2.4.20 kernel. IIRC, it had
something to do with unmounting a filesystem and losing data, if the data
was still in the cache. Is this true? Can I find a patch for this, if it is
true?
Thanks

I've only created a 2.4.20 patch; on my TODO list for the next
fortnight is to create a 2.4.23 patch, as we move towards a 2.4.23
release.
