Subject: New ACPI error/warning with Linus' latest GIT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/26/395

This time on a HP Pavillion DV2000 ,
ACPI: EC: GPE = 0x17, I/O: command/status = 0x66, data = 0x62<6>ACPI: PCI Root 
Bridge [PCI0] (0000:00)
ACPI: EC: Handler for query 0x57 is not found!
Seems to be a new warning/error, too noisy debugging again?
Regards,
