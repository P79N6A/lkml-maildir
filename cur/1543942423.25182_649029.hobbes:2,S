Tried, but didn't help.
Menuconfig can't select these as modules. So may be that's they need

     [*] Enable different security models
     [*]   Socket and Networking Security Hooks (NEW)
     [*]   Default Linux Capabilities (NEW)
     [*] File POSIX Capabilities (EXPERIMENTAL)
     [ ] Root Plug Support (NEW)
Thanks,
