Hi... I was going through kernel traffic and read the article on the
Maestro Driver problems.. I'm having very similar problems on my
Dell i5000e laptop.
The symtoms are:
When I play MP3's, on an otherwise unloaded system, I notice progressive
noisiness.. The longer it plays, (5-60 minutes), the stronger these
artifacts are. It's like a constant high-frequency twirping and very
annoying.
When I have xmms 'seek' around, that tends to cause it to start
introducing those artifacts.. If I stop the MP3 player and restart it, the
artifacts go away completely, though they come back again.
A second symptom is that occasionally a channel drops out; either left or
right.
Thse tends to happen on 'song boundries'. IE, times when the sound buffer
is switched before the chip finishes sending it.
Scott
