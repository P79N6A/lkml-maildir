well, look again. a source-rpm is just the tar-ball (maybe some patches
too) and a spec-file (which list the process of compiling and the files
and some info)
i think you're really overreacting.

we're talking about the same sources here. talking about binaries means
you missed the point. you can distributed binaries in a tarball too and
that doesn't mean taballs are evil, is it ?

i understand every single word, but when you put them together i don't
understand where you're getting at. instead of complaining you could
already have solved your problem, without any fuzz. instead you chose
to keep ranting about it.
(ok, i must admit that that is not entirely your fault ;))
