No!  That would actually increase the confusion.  You can connect almost any
SCSI device to the Mylex RAID controller, but you won't be able to use
anything that isn't a drive configured through the controller. (There's a
DOS ASPI driver to let you see a CDROM on the bus, but that's only there
for installation support.)
If you list the RAID controller as a SCSI device, people *will* think they
can plug any SCSI device they have onto it and be able to use it.  Well,
they cannot (and never will.)  Additionally, nothing the driver provides
lives under /dev/{sd,st,sg}* and you have ZERO SCSI layer access through
the driver.
