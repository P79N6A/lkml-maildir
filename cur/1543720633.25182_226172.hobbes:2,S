Subject: [2.6.7-bk patch] Update Documentation/filesystems/Locking

Hi Andrew, hi Linus,
As I discovered while working on NTFS and as agreed by Andrew, a
filesystem's ->writepage() implementation nowadays must run either
redirty_page_for_writepage() or the combination of set_page_writeback()/
end_page_writeback().  Failure to do so leaves the page itself marked
clean but it is tagged as dirty in the radix tree (PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY).
This incoherency can lead to all sorts of hard-to-debug problems in the
filesystem like having dirty inodes at umount and losing written data.
Please apply the below patch which updates
Documentation/filesystems/Locking to reflect this requirement.
Best regards,
	Anton
