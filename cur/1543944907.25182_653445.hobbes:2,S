Oh! So your issue is that since time_freq is stored in ppm, or in effect
a usecs per sec offset, when we add it to something other then 1 second
we mis-apply what NTP tells us to. Is that right?

Right, so if NTP has us apply a 10ppm adjustment, instead of doing:
	NSEC_PER_SEC + 10,000
We're doing:
	NSEC_PER_SEC + CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST + 10,000
Which, if I'm doing my math right, results in a 10.002ppm adjustment
(using the 999847467ns number above), instead of just a 10ppm
adjustment.
Now, true, this is an error, but it is a pretty small one. Even at the
maximum 500ppm value, it only results in an error of 76 parts per
billion. As you'll see below, that tends to be less error then what we
get from the clock granularity. Is there something else I'm missing here
or is this really the core issue you're concerned with?
If not, I'll agree that we may need to tune the "B" side of the
equation, but can we also agree that the very large error caused, even
without NTP adjustments, being involved by the A != B can be addressed
separately. That way if A is calculated in the same way as B, when we
fix B, we will at the same time fix A. Does that sound like a step
forward?

This might need some more explanation, as I'm not certain I know what
update_cycles refers to. Do you mean cycle_interval? I guess I'm not
completely sure how you're suggesting we change things here.

Dropping the tick adjustment? By that do you mean the tick_usec value
set by adjtimex()? I don't quite see why we want that. Could you expand
here?

Ok, so sitting down and doing the math, I see for the pit clocksource
your point is correct. For relatively fine grained clocksources (the pit
having ~900ns resolution) the larger the cycle_interval gets, the
smaller the error becomes. So when the NTP_INTERVAL_FREQ is 2 instead of
HZ, the error does get quite small, even if we don't add in the
CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST factor.
I think here's where the contention has been, as I've been using the
jiffies clocksource in my head for the previous back-and-forths. The
jiffies clocksource is different, as due to its coarseness, the normal
cycles_interval is only 1. So dropping NTP_INTERVAL_FREQ from HZ to 2
doesn't improve the error, it basically stays constant.
I sat down and ran through some numbers, seeing how the error rates
changed as HZ changed, with and without CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST and how NO_HZ
effects it as well. The .c file is attached, but here is the output for
jiffies, pit, and acpi_pm:

So you are right, w/ pit & NO_HZ, the granularity error is always very
small both with or without CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST. 
However, without CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST, the jiffies error increases for all
values of HZ except 100 (which at first seems odd, but seems to be due
to loss from rounding in the ACTHZ calculation).
One interesting surprise in the data: With CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST=0, the
acpi_pm's error frequency shot up in the !NO_HZ cases. This ends up
being due to the acpi_pm being a very close to a multiple (3x) of the
pit frequency, so CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST helps it as well.

Well, if it weren't for the jiffies clocksource error, to correct for
the sub 100ppb error, I'd agree with you to #define CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST 0
for CONFIG_NO_HZ. But until that's worked out I'm not sure.
Further it seems to point that if we are going to be chasing down small
sub-100ppb errors (which I think would be great to do, but lets not make
users to endure 200+ppm errors while we debate the fine-tuning :) we
might want to consider a method where we let ntp_update_freq take into
account the current clocksource's interval length, so it becomes the
base value against which we apply adjustments (scaled appropriately).
Phew, this is turning into a long mail. So let's summarize:
There are 3 sources of error that we've discussed here:
1) The large (280ppm) error seen with no-NTP adjustment, caused by the
inconsistent (A!=B) interval comparisons which started this discussion,
which my patch does address.
2) The medium (153-0ppm)clocksource granularity error shown in the data
above, caused by the actual interval length not matching the requested
interval length (what CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST tries to compensate for when
using jiffies/PIT).
3) The smaller (0.076ppm max) NTP adjustment error caused by the
parts-per-billion == nsec-per-sec shortcut used in combination w/ a base
interval that is not actually a second (due to CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST being
added in) in ntp_update_frequency() 
All of these are somewhat interdependent. One could consider that #1 is
in part due to #2, and #2 also causes #3, as there isn't proper scaling
being done in #3.
Fixing all of these in one swoop would be great, and I think we should
spend time continuing to refine the code. However, I'm just not sure
that we have a solution at this point for all the cases we have to
consider.
So given I do want to continue this discussion and work, would it be
possible that I fix up the #1 item above (including resolving the double
conflicting merges that have already gone in) as implemented in my last
patch, without your objection?
Again, I really appreciate you're continued deep observations and
feedback here.
thanks
