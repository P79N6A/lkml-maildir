cdrecord neither does drop the privileges by accident nor by malice.
What I however see is that a completely unneeded incompatible interface change 
has been applied to a _stable_ Kernel.
On a cleanly designed OS with fine grained permissions, a program like cdrecord
does not need to worry about the permissions as it gets exactly the needed 
permissions granted by the execution environment.
