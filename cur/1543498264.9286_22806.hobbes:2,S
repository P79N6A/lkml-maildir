Subject: Still slow NFS reading versus 2.2.9

Hello,
I have reported some trouble having concurrent 2.2.9 NFS client
against a 2.2.9 knfsd 1.3 server.
I just tested with 2.2.9-ac4 and iozone. One iozone is correct
(not amazing, but just correct) :
IOZONE performance measurements:
        6260155 bytes/second for writing the file
        4870301 bytes/second for reading the file
However, 2 iozones (from the same client for example) show bad
behavior during rereading :
IOZONE performance measurements:
        3203715 bytes/second for writing the file
        604157 bytes/second for reading the file
Here : 3203715 * 2 ~= 6260155 (a little better), but :
       604157 * 2 < 4870301 (which is really bad).
During the reading, the load of the server (which is doing nothing
else than serving the 2 NFS clients) climbs up to 5 (or more), and
is almost unresponsive.
With FreeBSD clients, the behavior is linear during reading, and
the load of the server does not jump to sky.
If I can provide more information, tell me what to do.
A+,
