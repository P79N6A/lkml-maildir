Well, as long as *any* part of the kernel ever links to proprietary 
code, then GPL functions link to it in exactly the same way ndiswrapper 
enables.  It's only a matter of how many steps of separation.
A perfectly GPL USB network driver linked to GPL-only functions feeds 
data into the kernel where it swirls about and emerges from a 
proprietary network filesystem driver, for example.
