SUSv3 doesn't seem to specify one way or the other.  I don't have the
POSIX specs, and the old docs I have suggest that mq_open() creates an
object which is to be closed upon exec.  Anyone have a clue if this is
actually required?  Patch below sets this as default (if indeed it's
valid/required).
thanks,
