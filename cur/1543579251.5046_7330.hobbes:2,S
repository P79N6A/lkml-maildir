I thought setsockopt is meant to set an option in the socket, something
_stateful_, a PUSH doesn't set any option, it isn't stateful and it _only_
controls the I/O (aka ioctl ;). Anyways either ioctl or setsockopt is fine in
pratice so I've no real problem.

NAGLE algorithm is only one, CORK algorithm is another different algorithm. So
probably it would be not appropriate to mix CORK and NAGLE under the name
"CONTROL_NAGLING", but certainly I agree they could stay together under another
name ;).
