I understand your concern, and agree that using the array as resource 
manager is not the best way. But for now it's not possible as you know. 
We need a better resource manager for PCI subsystem to manage the 
various resources (traditional, device specific, bus related), which is 
another independent work from SR-IOV change.

The array is obvious straightforward and can be easily replaced with a 
more advanced resource manager in the future. So I don't think we going 
  further from or closer to the goal.
