I have a couple of links for you to look at:
---
http://www.cpusite.examedia.nl/docs/amd_msi_news.html
     At this moment the MSI MS-6167 is about the only available Slot-A
board in the Netherlands. It seems that this board has some AGP-problems
with three types of cards: 3dfx Banshee-based, Matrox G100 and Matrox
G200. Unfortunately we are not talking about small incompatibility
problems, but serious damage to both board and graphic card. Nor MSI or
AMD could confirm whether this is an AMD Irongate chipset problem or a
MSI-only problem.
     Hung however ensured us that all other cards work flawlessly, a
warning message is supplied with the mainboard and that - as expected -
MSI is addressing the problem.

AMD Removes MSI From Motherboard List-Chris 'ruiner' Tom 11:31 p.m. CST
And you thought all Athlon motherboards were the same.  Thanks to
Muzaffer for letting me know that AMD yanked the MSI board off of the
recommended list.
MSI F's Up Their Athlon Board?-Chris 'ruiner' Tom 6:43 p.m. CST
Fullon 3D has word that MSI screwed up their Athlon board by going the
cheap route.  No wonder I get no reply back from them. ;)

I saw some more as well, but these are the ones I found immediately. I
do remember seeing a "MSI recalls motherboard" article as well (perhaps
that was at The Register). I seriously suggest you look into it :)
