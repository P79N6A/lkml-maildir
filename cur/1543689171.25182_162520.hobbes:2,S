I recently posted a problem with a Promise 
UltraTrak 133 TX2 controller (subject: PROBLEM: Powerquest Drive 
Image let the kernel panic). With kernel 2.4.20 every time moving 
several GB of data I get an OOPS. I already thought trying a 
controller with a SI680-chipset... Maybe that's not a good idea.
