Oh, but those people with coding skills did their work already years ago.
Not many people use this work, but it exists. Eric Youngdale wrote
scsidev. From man scsidev:
DESCRIPTION
       scsidev is a utility that is used to  guarantee  that  the
       same  device node can be used for the same scsi device, no
       matter what other scsi devices are added or  removed  from
       the  scsi  chain.   The  need  for this tool arose because
       device numbers are assigned dynamicly at boot time, and if
       a  new  disk  were  added  to  the system (or if some disk
       didn't spin up), then fixed device nodes would  cause  the
       wrong  filesystems  to be mounted, checked, etc.
A run produces output
