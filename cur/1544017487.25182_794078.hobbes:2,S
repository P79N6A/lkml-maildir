And it adds more #ifdefs.  All these conditional initializations on
CONFIG_SMP are really cluttering up the code.  It also conflicts with
one of my goals with these patches: have as much state as possible
already prepared when a cpu boots.  For the boot cpu this means static
initialization.  For secondary cpus, that means setting up the values
in setup_per_cpu_areas().  This eliminates any window where the state
isn't ready yet, as you've already seen with per_cpu_offset.
And is_boot_cpu was a worthwhile optimization on its own.  I had plans
on using it in more places later.
