I rely heavily on 'find . -type f -size 0b \! -name \*,t' to find out
what files are new so I can make sure to include them in my CVS
tree. In this sense I'd say 2.5 is far less source control friendly.
The lack of having .orig's generated per default like 2.1 did and not
having an env-var one could set to get 2.5 to use the same defaults as
2.1 is what makes me really dislike 2.5.
Oh well, I guess I should get back to coding ;-)
