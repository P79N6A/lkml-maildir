I'll have to check on that.

How is using gcc builtins instead of reimplementations thereof a "ugly
trick"? Sure, there are now problems with the new aliasing code: Here egcs
introduces a new optimization that gives _better_ code overall. But that
happens to clash with the way the kernel is written, as has happened
before.

In this case you can get that (more or less) by foregoing strict aliasing
and using the string.h implementations as they stand.
