That's not enough.
If the IO has already been started, splice needs to wait.

Yeah, that's just wrong.
Your suggested:

would work, but I suspect that for a server, returning EAGAIN once is 
actually the best option - if it has a select() loop, and something else 
is running, the "return EAGAIN once" actually makes tons of sense (it 
would basically boil down to the kernel effectively saying "ok, try 
anything else you might have pending in your queues first, if you get back 
to me, I'll block then").
