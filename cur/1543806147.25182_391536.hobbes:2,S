I would argue that in a non realtime environment sched_yield() is not  
useful at all.  When you want to wait for another process, you wait  
explicitly for that process using one of the various POSIX-defined  
methods, such as mutexes, condition variables, etc.  There are very  
clearly and thoroughly defined ways to wait for other processes to  
complete work, why rely on usleep(0) giving CPU to some other task  
when you can explicitly tell the scheduler "I am waiting for task foo  
to release this mutex" or "I can't run until somebody signals this  
condition variable".
Cheers,
