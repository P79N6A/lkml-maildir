1. Does not compile without RT_DEADLOCK_DETECT:
kernel/rt.c: In function `change_owner':
kernel/rt.c:556: error: structure has no member named `debug'
kernel/rt.c: In function `pi_setprio':
kernel/rt.c:576: error: structure has no member named `debug'
kernel/rt.c: In function `task_blocks_on_lock':
kernel/rt.c:677: error: structure has no member named `debug'
kernel/rt.c:687: error: structure has no member named `debug'
kernel/rt.c: In function `__up_mutex':
kernel/rt.c:1223: error: structure has no member named `debug'
2. My problem (see my LKML mails yesterday) is not yet solved:
The latency tracer shows latencies of at most 40 microseconds,
but my test program at rtprio 99 sometimes did not get any CPU 
for milliseconds...
