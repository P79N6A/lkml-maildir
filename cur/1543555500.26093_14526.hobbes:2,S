You just broke ksymoops.  Removing the [< >] is a bad idea, they are
one of the few things that identifies the addresses in the log,
otherwise they just look like hex numbers.  ksymoops has to scan log
files which can contain anything and somehow pick out the interesting
lines, you need some identifier on the lines.

There should be no need to restrict the number of lines printed, it is
limited by the top of the kernel stack.  If there are more than 32
trace entries on the stack then they should be printed.
