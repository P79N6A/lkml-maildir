I have seen the same in a lot of other places. For some self-baked patch, I 
added <linux/security.h> to the front of includes and promptly got flooded 
with warnings.
IMO, every H (and every C) file should have all the includes that are 
necessary to get at enums, structs, etc. even if other H files do this.
I'd volunteer to do this. What's LKMLs and the big guys' opinion?
