Yes, using stock idle sleep bits.

I've separated the buglet fix parts from the rest, so there are four
patches instead of two.  I've also hidden the knobs, though for the
testing phase at least, I personally think it would be better to leave
the knobs there for people to twiddle.  Something Willy said indicated
to me that 'credit' would be more palatable than 'grace', so I've
renamed and updated comments to match.  I think it might look better,
but can't know since 'grace' was perfectly fine for my taste buds ;-)
I'll post as soon as I do some more cleanup pondering and verification.
