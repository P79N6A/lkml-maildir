well, it's your baby and they are your priorities (and i'm really not 
trying to interfere), but still - my personal experience is that syntax 
and functional correctness are strongly connected. I dont claim that 
this particular issue of lock initialization and abstraction is a big 
deal in itself, but cruft does add up over time and becomes a real 
obstacle. I usually spend alot of quality time cleaning up my own code, 
because i know that it directly results in a better ability to improve, 
extend or debug the code in the future. [ Then again, i dont write code 
for 9 platforms :-) ]
( for example the ACPI practice of allocating opaque 'handler' pointers 
  that carry no type at [they are void *] is playing with fire. It in 
  essence disables the remaining little bit of type-safety that C has. )
