Honestly, I think there is an even more fundamental issue at hand.  If
the goal is transparent and flexible use of huge pages it seems to me
that there is two ways to go:
1) Continue with hugetlbfs and work to finish implementing all of the
operations (that make sense) properly (like read, write, truncate, etc).
2) Recognize that trying to use hugetlbfs files to transparently replace
normal memory is ultimately a hack.  Normal memory is not implemented as
a file system so using hugetlb pages here will always cause headaches as
implemented.  So work towards removing filesystem-like behaviour and
treating huge pages more like regular memory.
If we can all agree on 1 or 2 then it should be easier to make decisions
like this thread calls for.  I'll put my vote in for #2.  Thoughts?
