you'll also need to add a dep_map to the cpu_hotplug structure itself.
and i think this extension of lockdep to the new lock type will be 
invariant with the per-cpu optimizations i suggested in the previous 
mail: because it's only the scalability of cpu_hotplug_lock() that will 
improve [dramatically], its locking semantics wont.
