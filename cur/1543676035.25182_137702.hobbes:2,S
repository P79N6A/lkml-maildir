Actually, it is/was a SCSI problem.  The short version being that it is/was
easier to hotplug an entire HBA rather than an individual device.  That is
being changed in 2.5 right now.  usb-storage used an HBA-per-device, while
SBP2 uses a single HBA.
Of course, all this is being changed right now in 2.5.x
