Last time I checked (about 2 months ago) FIPS was not able to work with 
NTFS partitions - you'll probably have to use Partition Magic or 
something similar to modify the NTFS partition (but why not just create 
the NTFS partition of a smaller size and then use the unpartitioned 
space for a ext2 partition?).
