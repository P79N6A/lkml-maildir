I've closed the entry.  It is SuperH cache flushing issue at I/O.
Then, thinking again, I think that my argument for do_swap_page() is
still valid.
	When the page is swapped in, the cache for the page is flushed
	__only if__ it's not found in swap cache.
I don't see any reason why we need to flush the cache here.
