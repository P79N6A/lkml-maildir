OK. "never fail" in the sense that the driver has advertised a mask
which equals or exceeds the platform capabilities. 
Bottom line is the driver has to check the platform DMA support
likes the proposed mask and adjust it's behavior accordingly.
Existing API and Arjen's proposal both require that.

aic driver could try all three in order of preference?
"extremely useful" seems like a stretch to me.

I expect DMA support to determine how many bits are needed to
address all of physical RAM and accept/reject the 64/39/32-bit DMA
mask as appropriate. I haven't studied x86 DMA support recently.
There might be valid reasons it doesn't work that way.
