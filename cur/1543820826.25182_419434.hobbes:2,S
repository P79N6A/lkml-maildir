It still can't typecheck void pointers. With C++ they're very rare.
Look at the contortions needed to get the min() macro to be typesafe.

For list_head, no. But coding more complex data structures as type-safe 
macros is not practicable.
As an example, you can easily get C++ to inline the hash function in a 
generic hashtable or the compare in a sort. I dare you to do it in C.

You're looking at a library while we were talking about the language and 
compiler. But anyway.

I wouldn't count startup time as efficiency, unless you have several 
million global bitset objects.

Add a constructor which does not touch the data members, and the data 
will (probably) end up in .bss.

Patches accepted :)
It's just a library, you're free to optimize it. I'd guess that 
_M_do_set() is very rarely called, and that the performance difference 
is small anyway.

It is inlined. Why do you think it is not?

Certainly, one can't claim that all C++ libraries are will written. But 
gcc library mostly is.
Again, if you don't like some library, don't use it. The kernel would 
use its own version anyway since it has to be freestanding.

The names of the fields are not hidden. You just don't have to 
mindlessly repeat them.
The 'know everything' argument seems to apply equally well to ordinary 
functions: "I *must know* about calls to schedule() and those expensive 
atomic operations, don't hide them behind mutex_lock()!"

I'm sure you can eliminate them if you want, but working to remove some 
microseconds of boot time is a complete waste of effort IMO.
