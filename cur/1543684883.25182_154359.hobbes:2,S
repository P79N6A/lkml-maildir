Nope -- what you get is a corrupted filesystem.... Usually, a lost directory
gets put in lost+found, othertimes you get a "corrupted inode", and if the
inode is cleared you then find every file that was contained in the directory
that used to be the inode, is now in lost+found.
The only place I can think of that this might not happen are those filesystems
that don't use the UNIX style tree structure.
