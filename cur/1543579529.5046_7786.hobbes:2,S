Would this be an SMP IA32 box with glibc 2.2? I have two such boxen 
showing exactly the same behaviour, although I can't reproduce it at will.
It happens even when I use the same kernel and XFree86 binaries which were
working perfectly before the upgrade. The LDT handling fixes which were
added between 2.4.0-prerelease and the real 2.4.0 appeared to make this
_slightly_ less frequent, but I still rarely have an X server uptime of
more than a few days.
