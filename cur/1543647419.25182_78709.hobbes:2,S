Subject: race aware poll implementation on SMP

Hello.
I'm writing a kernel module for 2.4 kernel. This
module serves 2 device files. One of them represents
hardware and the other is used to connect a software
emulation of that hardware if the read adapter 
is absent.
When an application accesses the first device it is
put to sleep till the software emulation supplies the
needed data.
Emulation sleeps in a poll when device ain't accessed.
It is supposed to work on SMP machine.
Should poll fileop be made race aware? What if the
wake_up happens between checking the poll status and
puting process in wait queue?
=====
Best regards,
Oleg Afanasjev
