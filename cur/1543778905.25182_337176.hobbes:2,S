Subject: Syncing single filesystem (slow USB writing)

Mandrake always mounted USB sticks with sync option; it was effectively noop 
except for a patch that implemented limited dsync semantic.
Now, when full sync support for FATis in kernel, moutning with sync became 
real pain. Writing speed dropped from 3MB/s to 30KB/s in my case (and I am 
not alone).
One idea how to improve situation - continue to mount with dsync (having 
basically old case) and do frequent sync of filesystem (this culd be started 
as HAL callout or whatever). Unfortunately, I could not find a way to request 
a sync (flush) of single mount point or block device. Have I missed 
something?
TIA
