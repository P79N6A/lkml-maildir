That would be the cleanest and purest behavior. But it's possible to set
one console to UTF-8 and another to legacy mode. So one can corrupt the
user's console just by issuing a reset or echo -e '\033c'. (Although one
can argue that users who know what UTF-8 is also knows how to set the
encoding back)
Until userspace is more capable of setting back the terminal to its
previous configuration, I would tend to agree with Jan, that we should
leave the current utf setting of that particular vc alone.
