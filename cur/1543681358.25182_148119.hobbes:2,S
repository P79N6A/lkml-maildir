I have some sympathy with SAN developers, because you can treat the link
as dedicated and just for the SAN so you can implement iSCSI optimised
code. The right engineering approach probably consists of removing iSCSI
and doing the job right but I appreciate there are non engineering
issues.

Memory bandwidth is your killer quite often, you have to keep the CPU
away from the data and often even off the memory bus holding most of the
data.

You still have the partial trust stuff and the ability to violate the
socket api in the interest of speed - that helps.

Thats mostly an API issue. Socket API found non optimal after 20 years.
Hardly shocking news - the cluster people already changed API, Larry
McVoy proposed stuff like splice years ago because he saw it coming.

TCP aware hardware is good, segmentation, prediction, buffer/sequence
matchers etc but you don't want the policy parts in silicon

Only if your ASIC worst case is wire speed. If your ASIC has one path it
must drop to software for and has a low powered internal CPU to fix up,
you just lost and you'll plow like a cisco with too many filter rules to
do in silicon.

Some of this is certainly about how you partition the load - its no
different to things like RAID. We've had hardware raid, software raid,
and finally people are popping up with neat hybrids. We've had software
audio, hardware audio and again now we are seeing hybrids that do
different bits in hardware and software - ditto modems.

You don't have to. You can go build and test and maintain a set of TOE patches.
Nobody is stopping you. Lots of Linux code exists because someone decided that
the official story was wrong and proved it so.
