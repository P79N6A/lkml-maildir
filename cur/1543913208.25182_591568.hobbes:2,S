Na, that cannot be the case since it only activates when an OOM condition

Ah. That is good news.

Efficiency is not a criterion for a rarely used emergency recovery 
measure.

Peters patch is much more invasive and requires a coupling of various 
subsystems that is not good.

Given your tests: It looks like we do not need it.

Either not necessary or also needed without these patches.

We have a global dirty page limit already. I fully support Peters work on 
dirty throttling.
These results show that Peters invasive approach is not needed. Reclaiming 
easy reclaimable pages when necessary is sufficient.
