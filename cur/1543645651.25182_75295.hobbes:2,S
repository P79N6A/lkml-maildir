Hi folks,
Is it just me, or {www,ftp}.kernel.org is down? It
seems so, from this side of the atlantic. And I cant
find 2.5.40 on any mirror I've tried (which included
everything listed in dns for www.uk.kernel.org,
www.us.kernel.org, etc). So, what gives?
Hope this is just a temporary hiccup. Sorry for the
disturbance.
Regards,
/kj
