When this combination occurs userspace is crazy/uncoordinated/dumb and
can't be "satisfied". Perhaps the better approach is to ignore both
guarantee and limit (cap) in this case -- treat it as if userspace
hasn't specified either.
Alternatively the kernel can refuse to allow configuring such a
combination in the first place. This is one reason tying guarantees and
limits (caps) into the same framework would be useful.
