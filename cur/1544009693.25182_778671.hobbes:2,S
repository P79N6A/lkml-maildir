Subject: [PATCH 02/44] KVM: ppc: fix set regs to take care of msr change
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

From: Hollis Blanchard <hollisb@us.ibm.com>
When changing some msr bits e.g. problem state we need to take special
care of that. We call the function in our mtmsr emulation (not needed for
wrtee[i]), but we don't call kvmppc_set_msr if we change msr via set_regs
ioctl.
It's a corner case we never hit so far, but I assume it should be
kvmppc_set_msr in our arch set regs function (I found it because it is also
a corner case when using pv support which would miss the update otherwise).
