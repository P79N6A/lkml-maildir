Peter Samuelson's version worked in my Slackware systems. Miquel's kwhich is
ok too.
Another problem in Makefile. I guess this change between pre 12 and 13 is a
typo:
 CONFIG_SHELL := $(shell if [ -x "$$BASH" ]; then echo $$BASH; \
-         else if [ -x /bin/bash ]; then echo /bin/bash; \
+         else if [ -x /bin/bash ]; then echo /bin/bash2; \
          else echo sh; fi ; fi)
I have ash as /bin/sh and there's also /bin/bash but no /bin/bash2.
$ make oldconfig
Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "then")
rm -f include/asm
( cd include ; ln -sf asm-i386 asm)
/bin/bash2 scripts/Configure -d arch/i386/config.in
make: /bin/bash2: Command not found
make: *** [oldconfig] Error 127
