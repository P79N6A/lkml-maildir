After so many tries with different configurations,
I just found out that having my USB mouse pluged in
at boot time will just break everything up. So without
my USB mouse pluged in at boot time, everything is fine.
I hope this can help. Having my mouse pluged out at boot
time is a decent workaround for me. But if you want to
make more tests on my laptop, just ask.
Regards,
Nuage
