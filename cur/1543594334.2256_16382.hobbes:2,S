I have to agree with Matthew - "list_add_tail()" more clearly says what
the code is trying to do.
Aside from that, I will bet you a dollar that you'll see that using
"list_add_tail()" generating better code. Why? Simply because that way one
of the pointers is a constant, instead of being through indirection. Try
it and see.
And if order is arbitrary, please just use
	list_add(&s->s_list, super_blocks);
because otherwise why use the ".prev" at all?
