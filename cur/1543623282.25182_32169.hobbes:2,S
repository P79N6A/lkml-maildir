It's not on a big box, but I have a side by side of
2.5.6-pre2 and 2.5.6-pre2 with patches from 
http://www.zipworld.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.6-pre2/
2.5.6-pre2-akpm compiled with MPIO_DEBUG = 0 and ext2 
filesystem mounted with delalloc.
tiobench and dbench were on ext2.
bonnie++ and most other tests were on reiserfs.
2.5.6-pre2-akpm throughput on ext2 is much improved.

One odd number in lmbench is page fault latency.  Lmbench also 
showed high page fault latency in 2.4.18-pre9 with make_request, 
read-latency2, and low-latency.  2.4.19-pre1aa1 with read_latency2 
(2.4.19pre1aa1rl) did not show a bump in page fault latency.
