Basically, if you want to send something to the network, the kernel has to
copy your data to its memory space. It is an overhead and with these
patches, the kernel doesn't has to do it. So it is faster. Moreover, few
ethernet cards are able to compute the ip checksum so linux doesn't need
anymore to do that.

     Learning French is trivial: the word for horse is cheval, and
               everything else follows in the same way.
