We have a bit of a mess here.
for_each_pgdat() iterates over online nodes.
for_each_cpu() iterates over possible CPUs.
It's confusing and asymmetric.  If you have time, it would be nice to later
remove for_each_pgdat() and for_each_cpu() from the kernel altogether, use
for_each_online_cpu(), for_each_possible_cpu(), for_each_online_node(),
for_each_possible_node().
