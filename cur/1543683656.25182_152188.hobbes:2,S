The error is that modpost.c is compiled against the C library elf headers
instead of the kernel's own elf headers. My #ifndef patch is just a workaround
for a missing -Iinclude and possibly -nostdinc when modpost.c is compiled.
David's response to that was that I should update my C library headers
instead. This is doable, but kind of defeats the purpose of having test
machines with old user-spaces around in the first place.
Linus once said that Linux did its own offsetof() just to avoid relying
on a fully working user-space...
