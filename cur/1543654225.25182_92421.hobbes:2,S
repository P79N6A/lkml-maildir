Subject: 2.5.49: Severe PIIX4/ATA filesystem corruption

So, I finally braved it and tried running 2.5.49 on my workstation to
test out my RAID-6 patches.  There were no patches outside the md
area, and the ordinary filesystems aren't on md drives.
The two SCSI drives (SymBIOS controller) work just fine, but I have
gotten repeated, severe data corruption on the one ATA drive in the
system after only a few hours of operation.
Just thought I'd warn people...
