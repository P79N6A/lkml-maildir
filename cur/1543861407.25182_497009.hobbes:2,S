Well ..a lock_cpu_hotplug() in run_workqueue() and support for recursive
calls to lock_cpu_hotplug() by the same thread will avoid the problem
you mention. This will need changes to task_struct to track the
recursion depth. Alternately this can be supported w/o changes to
task_struct by 'biasing' readers over writers as I believe Gautham's 
patches [1] do.
