Well, I'm also experiencing starvation problems with CPU-bound 
loads. For example, I'm converting all my music collection from 
MP3 to OGG, and when using "oggenc" to convert from WAV to 
OGG, the system becomes pretty unresponsive: running commands 
on a terminal (for example a "ps axf") takes forever, unless you 
stop (Ctrl+S) the "oggenc" process. 
 
To avoid this, I had to lower "oggenc" priority using renice. Using 
renice <PID> +20 helped with starvation :-) 
 
Thanks!
