Wrong - think about /dev/loop0

They are doing the right thing (tm) _only_ in conjunction with this 
bootscript snippet:
	KVERSION=`uname -r`
         for module in `egrep '^alias (char|block)-major' \
             /lib/modules/$KVERSION/modules.alias /etc/modprobe.conf | \
             grep -v 1394 | awk '{print $3;}'`
         do
             modprobe $module
         done
I have, however, posted this snippet to linux-hotplug-devel and they 
rejected it for no apparent reason. This snippet loads exactly the same 
modules as the kernel would autoload with static /dev.
The "grep -v 1394" is due to the kernel bug described in the following 
message: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/5/30/143
Also the recent "enable all hotplug events" patch 
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/7/13/74
 + 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/7/20/47
) 
with a custom initramfs 
(
http://bugs.linuxfromscratch.org/attachment.cgi?id=112&action=view
) is 
a very good thing.
