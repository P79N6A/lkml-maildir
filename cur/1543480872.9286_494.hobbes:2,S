   David I am happy to see that you have removed the ->ato == HZ/50 ==
   quickack (that was always trashing the very useful information that
   we had in the ato field). My delack patch was/is doing that too and
   it is working fine so far.
Thanks for pointing out this bug.  I will use a different fix because
just setting it to one has no reason behind it (I'd rather use the
initial value chosen by kernels previous to the quick ack mechanism
being introduced half a year ago, and thus what 2.0.x uses too).
So I'll send a fix to Linus under seperate cover.
As to your other ack fixes, they may have been just fine, but they
were quite extensive and our ACKing policy has such large
ramifications that I don't think they are appropriate to include at
this time until I can study them very deeply and perform a lot of
verifications.  I'd rather fix show stopper bugs right now :-)
Later,
David S. Miller
