That's pretty much what I expected. Overall I'm happier with this later 
version as it doesn't impact on the noticable improvement on systems that are 
not overloaded, yet keeps performance at least that of the untuned version. I 
can tune it to be better for this work load but it would be to the detriment 
of the rest. 
Ultimately this is the problem I see with 2.6 ; there is no way for the vm to 
know that "all the pages belonging to the currently running tasks should try 
their best to fit into the available space by getting an equal share". It 
seems the 2.6 vm gives nice emphasis to the most current task, but at the 
detriment of other tasks that are on the runqueue and still need ram. The 
original design of the 2.6 vm didn't even include this last ditch effort at 
taming swappiness with the "knob", and behaved as though the swapppiness was 
always set at 100. Trying to tune this further with just the swappiness value 
will prove futile as can be seen by the "best" setting of 20 in your test 
case still taking 4 times longer to compile the kernel. 
This is now a balance tradeoff of trying to set a value that works for your 
combination of the required ram of the applications you run concurrently, the 
physical ram and the swap ram. As you can see from your example, in your 
workload it seems there would be no point having more swap than your physical 
ram since even if it tries to use say 40Mb it just drowns in a swapstorm. 
Clearly this is not the case in a machine with more ram in different 
circumstances, as swapping out say openoffice and mozilla while it's not 
being used will not cause any harm to a kernel compile that takes up all the 
available physical ram (it would actually be beneficial). Fortunately most 
modern machines' ram vs application sizes are of the latter balance.
There's always so much more you can do...
wli, riel care to comment?
