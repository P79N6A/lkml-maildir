Curious.. It looks like the ACPI resources have the correct reservation 
for the MMCONFIG window according to what the register says the location 
should be. There's no other reservations that overlap with that range 
(f000000-f7ffffff), and according to the 965 datasheet there's nothing 
that's hard-coded to occupy that memory range. I can't really see what 
this range could be conflicting with.
What happens if you take out the chipset register detection, does the 
MCFG table give you the same result? Wonder if they're doing something 
funny with start/end bus values or something in their table. There's 
some code in my patch that prints out the important data from the MCFG 
table, can you tell me what that shows with the chipset detection taken out?
If that doesn't provide any useful information, I think we may need some 
assistance from Intel chipset/motherboard people to figure out what is 
going on here..
