Sorry for coming in late on this.
There is no problem with dropping drivers/char/dz.[ch] from the official
tree.  Us Linux/VAX guys work off our own CVS tree on SourceForge, so we
can continue to carry the drivers/char/dz.[ch] until we've got the
new driver working.
So, Jan-Benedict, there is no major panic to get the new driver working
for us before Rusty/Linus remove the old one.
Later,
Kenn (another Linux/VAX guy)
