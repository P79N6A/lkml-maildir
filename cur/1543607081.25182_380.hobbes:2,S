Probably you should do additional checks. I run a GeForce II MX here with
exactly this driver and pre6 - and have no problem at all. I tried both driver
version 1251 and 1541, and both work.
Of course I do not back the manufacturers' religion "we don't wanna show people
how we managed to make a kernel driver 800kB of size". Only I believe this is
no real loss, as nobody wants to follow this god anyway.
