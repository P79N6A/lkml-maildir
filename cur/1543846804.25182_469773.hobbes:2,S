Why am I okay with it?
I'm okay with it because it touches files in drivers/acpi/*.c
Those files are Linux specific, and thus no problem
doing with them what we do with any other
Linux file.

no need to, as the patch didn't touch ACPICA files.

the sub-directories under drivers/acpi are ACPICA files.
They have a dual BSD/GPL license on them.
I've though of making an acpica sub-directory
to make this really clear, but there never seems to be
a good time to do stuff like that...

Okay, I've applied it, dealt with the conflicts,
and I'll send an -rc1 batch this week.

no need to.
If maintaining individual ACPI-related patches in -mm is a burden,
then refuse to.  While I'll never be able to match your latency,
I'm okay with it either way -- as I think either way the the
right thing happens in the long run.
