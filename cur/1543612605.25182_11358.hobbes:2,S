If the characters in the name determine the point of insertion, and the 
extent to which processing order correlates with the point of insertion 
determines how well caching works, then do you see my viewpoint?
Sure, nobody "should" have to engage in locality of reference, but God 
was not concerned somehow, and so disk drives make us get all very 
worried about locality of reference.

We should give Yura and Green a chance to run some benchmarks before I 
get into too much analyzing.  I have learned not to comment before 
seeing complete benchmarks.
