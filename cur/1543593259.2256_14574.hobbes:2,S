well, not all loads are IO-bound in the sense you're looking at.
in particular, the test I usually run (make -j2 with mem=48m)
is actually hurt by this patch.  but you're right, this change 
does improve streaming IO.

I certainly agree the code is dubious, but this is the reason 
inactive_target exists, afaikt.

otoh, the "complex calculation" was always trivial, 
and *more* autotuning than your suggested fix...
