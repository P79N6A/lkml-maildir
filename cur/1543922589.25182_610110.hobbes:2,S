Like I said this did not work with 2.6.24-rc1 (latest git). My distro 
(Ubuntu 7.10) kernel 2.6.22-10 also has the same behavior.

Ok, I failed to imagine the hardware makers' stupidity :) - In the case 
that you mentioned I agree that there is little that can be done based on 
device IDs. I'll check out subsequent releases to see if it gets fixed 
based on hardware characteristics (rt2500usb unloading and requesting the 
right one in my case for example).
Thanks
