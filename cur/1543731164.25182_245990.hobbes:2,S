I posted it before: it's a one-liner.  Again, below.
Cheers,

Name: Fix stop_machine() For Nick Sched
Status: Tested on 2.6.8.1-mm4
Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
Version: -mm
With Nick's scheduler, yield() on a RT task does nothing unless it's
SCHED_RR.  But __stop_machine_run() yields for migration threads to
move the kstopmachine threads onto the other CPUs.  Change it from
SCHED_FIFO to SCHED_RR, and it yields correctly.
