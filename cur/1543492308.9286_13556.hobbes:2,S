Just because your machine is not forwarding packets does not mean that it does
not need routes.  For instance, any machine that wishes to contact the outside
world needs a default route.  I think it simply is telling you that a temp
route that was added due to an ICMP redirect from another machine has expired
and has therefore been removed.  You seem to be getting debug messages though:
route.c: printk(KERN_DEBUG "ip_rt_advice: redirect to
		%d.%d.%d.%d/%02x dropped\n", NIPQUAD(rt->rt_dst), rt->key.tos);
