   But when I asked kumon to test it on his 8-way Xeon,
   page_cache_lock contention proved to be insignificant.
   
   Seems to only be a NUMA thing.
   
I doubt it is only a NUMA thing.  I say this for TUX web benchmarks
that tended to hold most of the resident set in memory, the page cache
locking changes were measured to improve performance significantly on
SMP x86 systems.
Ingo would be able to comment further.
Franks a lot,
