For 2.2 kernels I've found 5 MB reserved from swap until it was needed
was enough to ssh to the box and fix whatever was going on (whatever:
real world cases like slashdot effects, exploits from packetstorm and
other own made testcases that heavily overcommited memory). Nevertheless
the amount reserved was controllable via /proc.
And I do know it doesn't solve all cases but covering 99% of the real
world issues isn't a bad start at all, imho.
