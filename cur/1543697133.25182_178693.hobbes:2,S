I'm not sure. I should be running tripwire or something, this is the 
only one of my systems that doesn't run such a thing, as i have the  
firewall locked down and have been busy.
But it is true i accidently did iptables -F and it was left that way for 
a few days.
But this happens with any program, not just /bin/true, also the 
/bin/true on the root and chroot systems are identical. and with much 
interest i discovered, that if i unmount /proc, the problem goes away. aggh.
that is why it is not exhibiting itself in the chroot system, - no /proc.
I also remember that when this first happen nearly a year ago, some 
"unix engineer" at the ISP said, oh yeah that's because something in the 
ext2 filesystem header is corrupted.. i don't quite remember what he 
said exactly, something  that sounded so far fetched that i ignored it. 
does that ring any bells with anyone?
please help, ug, i hate having a linux system that's not reliable. feels 
like having a pet that's in pain or something.
btw,
/lib/libc.so.6 -> libc-2.2.5.so
