You should check basic .config things such as the CPU type.
Also ensure that you have `earlyprintk=vga' on the kernel boot command line.
The only thing I can think of which would cause such an early failure is
the kexec changes.  Does 2.6.13-rc1 work OK?  It had kexec.
If 2.6.13-rc1 fails then please try these patches, against 2.6.12:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/patch-2.6.12-git7.gz
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/patch-2.6.12-git8.gz
If 2.6.12-git7 works and 2.6.12-git8 fails then we'll know where to start
looking, thanks.
