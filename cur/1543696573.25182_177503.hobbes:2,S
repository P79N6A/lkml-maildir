Are you using hardware raid that shows the entire array like one disk that
should be partitioned, or do you want to use linux software raid?
If you're using hardware raid, you should consider what Peter said in his
message.

That depends on what filesystem you want to use.  With ext2/3 it varies
between 16GB (with 1KB blocks) and 1 or 2 TB (with 4KB blocks) per file.
Other filesystems have similair limits.  There have been several
comparisons, and a quick google search should bring up a few.  Try "linux
filesystem comparison"
