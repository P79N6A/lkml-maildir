Your average user is not going to be downloading kernel patches and
rebuilding his system.  
I think there's actually three issues here:
1) the US is not the only country with crypto laws.  The question is
   not whether the kernel will contain crypto, it's whether the
   crypto patches will shipped with the kernel tarball or downloaded
   from an external site (e.g., kerneli).
2) One thing that probably *has* changed is that it should be reasonable
   to add a formal crypto API into the standard kernel.  The kerneli 
   loopback API is a good model for this, and an API should be available
   to both kernel and userspace callers.  The standard package would 
   include a "null" module which immediately returns, so there would be 
   minimal additional overhead for the non-crypto user.
   Crypto developers would write against the API.  This should make
   it easy for users to add stronger (or weaker!) keys as local
   laws permit or require.
   Non-crypto developers would be encouraged to add calls to the
   crypto API, but it wouldn't be required.
3) Since the kernel will now contain a crypto API, the end user
   who wants to add the userspace daemon now only has to ask two
   questions:
    - do I have the programs?  This is no different than installing
	  ftpd from a CD-ROM.
    - do I have the necessary cipher module?  Again, the vast
	  majority of users will simply run their distro's kernel
	  module configuration file and select the appropriate ciphers
	  from a list.
   This is no different than what's already routinely done.
I would not rush into adding crypto support just because it can be
done, but I think it's reasonable for 2.4 to have a basic crypto
API and null module.  This lays the groundwork for the 2.4 distros
to add support crypto support as it becomes available.  The 
alternative is waiting until 2.6, or having the each of the
crypto modules reinvent the wheel.  (Just how many DES implementations
does one OS need - and how would someone exploit a hardware driver
that interfaces to a hardware encryption chip?)
