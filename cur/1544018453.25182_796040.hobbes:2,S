Subject: Unexpected cascaded epoll behavior - my mistake or kernel bug

Hello Davide and all others,
I have got to implementing yet another event library and I experience
something strange when level triggered epoll_wait() monitors another
level triggered epoll set. Top level epoll_wait() return information
about one event pending. The event points correctly to the monitored
second level epoll fd, but epoll_wait() on this fd with 0 or small timeout
returns zero/no events and top level epoll reporting is not reset at this
point so program enters busy loop. If there are events, they are processed
correctly. More interresting is, that the ill behavior is prevented if I
change number of debug writes into unrelated fd or if the application
is slowed down by strace to standard output. The strace to the
file does not (fortunatelly) hide ill behavior to the strange behavior
of my code or kernel can be documented in attached straces. The both
traces documents the busy loop cause for case, where there is created
epoll set with fd #3, that set monitors fd #0. When character arrives
at fd #0, the new epoll fd set with fd #4 is created ad fd #3 is added
into this new top level fd set.
epoll_create(8)                         = 3
epoll_ctl(3, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, 0, {EPOLLIN, {u32=6353264, u64=6353264}}) = 0
epoll_wait(3, {{EPOLLIN, {u32=6353264, u64=6353264}}}, 8, 20000) = 1
read(0, "E"..., 1)                      = 1
...
epoll_create(8)                         = 4
epoll_ctl(4, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, 3, {EPOLLIN, {u32=6353664, u64=6353664}}) = 0
epoll_wait(4, {{EPOLLIN, {u32=6353664, u64=6353664}}}, 8, 19998) = 1
epoll_wait(3, {{EPOLLIN, {u32=6353264, u64=6353264}}}, 8, 0) = 1

You may ask, why that terrible clam starts to writting new event library code
and why he needs to cascade event handling mechanisms. I try to defend myself
a little. If you do not like beat me, you can skip next section
==============================================
I am part of CTU university group working on realtime and industrial control
projects (RT-Ethernet, CAN, CANopen, profibus etc). I work even for PiKRON
company on other similar projects. We have need for base libraries for fast
and small libraries for Linux, RTEMS and system less based applications.
Some runs with as less as LPC21xx and 32kB of RAM memory. We need some
generic containers code, XML or bytecode driven graphic and support for test
builds of system less APPs or RTEMS based apps on Linux and preparation
of higher control hierarchy applications on Linux.
The GLIB would be good base, but for embedded systems the LGPL license
could be problem, the 32kB RAM and 256 kB FLASH for whole application
in some cases are other reasons why GLIB is not usable for many cases.
Even GLIB implementation is nice from portability point, but effectiveness
of GLIB main loop, complexity of containers with needs of plenty of mallocs
is year another story. So the containers and generic constructs are solved
by uLUt library 
http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/gitweb/ulut.git
 ,
http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~pisa/ulan/ulut.pdf.
Event processing on Linux or POSIX based OSes, I thought that libevent
is right way to go. It is yet another prerequisite for projects (acceptable),
but problem is, that in some cases, the libraries should allow the combination
with frameworks based on other mainloop implementation (Qt, GTK, Python).
Problem is, that combining libraries expecting different main loop
implementation is a problem. That is why the ul_evpoll library has been
born. The initial idea has been to define absolute minimal compatability
layer and API, which allows to run applications above libevent and in case
of the need above GLIB. To test that concept and allow use of the library
even standalone, the simple implementation above Sys V poll() call
has been included. To test Linux most advanced feature, simple epoll
support has been added. The yet another target has been met, when
applications could run over ul_evpoll API under GLIB main loop now.
This solves even Qt compatibility, because most distributions ships
Qt compiled against GLIB main loop.
The other important feature is to be able to switch or cascade event
monitoring at runtime when some third party library enforcing
different main loop implementation is dynamically loaded.
This goal has been achieved as well now. Next complex scenarios
works now
 * start on ul_evpoll sysvpoll, when GLIB based library is required
    create new ul_evpoll based on glib, cascade original set with
    epoll above it and continue to run with GLIB main loop
 * start with ul_evpoll lnxepoll, create ul_evpoll based on glib
    continue to run
The events can be inserted by GLIB based applications as glib event sources,
by uLUt based applications as ul_evpoll  events into ul_evpoll wrapper or
over original sysvpoll or lnxepoll event bases and all runs concurrently
without problems in my first test round. The lnxepoll cascaded over glib base
has other nice feature, that it corrects GLIB ill behavior for C10K problem for these
events, which are registered over ul_evpoll API as ul_evptrig_t into epoll based
ul_evpbase_t.
But because of generic approach of the code, I have tried to cascade
one ul_evpoll lnxepoll above another one for my curiosity and it does not
work as expected. It may be my bug, but strace result is strange
for me.
==============================================
The ul_evpoll library code is developed in uLan CVS at this moment
http://ulan.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ulan/ulan/host/libs4c/ulevloop/
Preconfigured code snapshot is there
http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~pisa/ulan/ul_evpoll-090123.tar.gz
The bug triggers on my system, when Linux epoll based event loop is started
_compiled/bin-utils/ul_evpchk lnxepoll
and then key 'E' and Enter is pressed. This creates new epoll base
and cascades original event base into it.
Some parts from uLUt, OMK and ul_evpoll  are parts of other projects already
