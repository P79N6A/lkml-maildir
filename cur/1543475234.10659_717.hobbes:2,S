Hello 
Today I'm using 2.2.0-pre3  I have the next message:
EXT2-fs warning (device 16:01): ext2_getblk: block < 0
The major number (16) is SCSI disk, but I haven't any SCSI in my system. All
my disk are IDE. I have running mutt and it creates a big file in my system,
but fsck doesn't report any problems in de partition ... switching today to
2.2.0pre4 ...
Greetings
Carlos Terron
