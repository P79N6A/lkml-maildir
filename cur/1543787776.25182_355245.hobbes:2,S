Hmm, the only problem with this is that it requires consensus on the
format of kernel sigsets.  Think about the 32-vs-64-bit compatibility
issues.
It should be cleared on PTRACE_DETACH, of course.  Do we even need the
GET functionality?  If not, is PTRACE_SET_IGNORE_SIGNAL taking a single
signal number sufficient?
