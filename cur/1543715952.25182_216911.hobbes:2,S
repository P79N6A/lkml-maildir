I once had the joy of debugging a memory overlay issue in an X.500 product,
that surfaced while porting from a "working" platform (IBM's AIX/370 product)
to IBM's AIX on the RS6K line.
The problem had the following characteristics:
It worked fine on AIX/370 (due to the way it's malloc() worked).
It worked fine on the RS6K if a debugging malloc() was used (and I tried
3 different ones).
It only crashed using the native malloc(), and the actual overlay happened
fairly early on, but the overlay's effects didn't become apparent till some 6
million (yes really) more malloc() calls allocated another 120M (yes really) on
the heap.  It was going *way* off the end of an allocated array, and the
canaries allocated by the AIX/370 and debugging mallocs caused the stray store
to hit non-critical data - but it hit a pointer used by the native malloc
(actually hopping over 2 entire other structures in the process), and said
botched pointer didn't surface till free() was called on that specific
structure.
Isn't much you can do kernel-side to protect against that sort of stray
pointer, unless you're using a tagged architecture like the late Intel i432
chipset.
