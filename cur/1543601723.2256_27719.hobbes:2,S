Hi,
  I've just started some tests to try to repeat the memory allocation
errors. I see the aa1 kernel is twice fast as -pre12!? Is this expected?
I have 2x intelPIII 933MHz, 1GB RAM, HIGMEM kernel, ReiserFS, aic7xxx,
eepro100.

Yesterday after havy tests and after memory alloc. errors already
appeared:

The documentation to dbech is a bit sparse (README,INSTALL). It's a bit
offtopic, but would someone explain me where does the dbench write, into
which directory? I performed the tests above under same user and in same
tmp/ directory, to be sure. Maybe it was not necessary at all. ;)
Thanks
