hm, a compromise.
One other concern I have with this is that I expect -mregparm will make
kgdb (and now crashdump) less useful.  When incoming args are on the stack
you have a good chance of being able to see what their value is by walking
the stack slots.
When the incoming args are in registers I'd expect that it would be a lot
harder (or impossible) to work out their value.
Have the kdump guys thought about (or encountered) this?
