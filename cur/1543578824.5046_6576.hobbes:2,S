Since I installed Kernel 2.4.0 VMware is no longer able to
recognize my cdrom drive. VMware shows a dialog box on power up
with following content:
[...]
CDROM: '/dev/scd0' exists, but does not appear tobe a CDROM device.
Error connecting the CDROM device
[...]
At the same time my syslog records the following message:
Jan 13 21:49:57 nexus kernel: sr0: CDROM (ioctl) reports ILLEGAL REQUEST.
I tried 2.2.18 and VMware recognized the cdrom drive.
Any hints?
Cheers
Martin
