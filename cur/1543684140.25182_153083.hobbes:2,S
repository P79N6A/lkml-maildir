Well... For sure, I can write a LD_PRELOAD lib dealing with SIGILL, but
how do I enable it for the whole system. That is, I'd need to give
LD_PRELOAD=xxx at the kernel's boot prompt to have it as en environment
variable for each and every process?
That sounds a tad inelegant to me. Really, I'd prefer to see libstdc++
be compiled for i386 ...
...and IFF those new opcodes bring _that_ much performance, then we
should think about another Debian distribution for i686-linux. Up to
now, I was really proud of having _one_ distribution that's basically
capable of running on all and any machines I own...
