The sys_set_thread_area interface gets worse with every patch you post..
Why do you really need a magic multiplexer syscall (you could have just
used prctl if you don't need a sane interface..)?
What about a proper interface like:
asmlinkage int
sys_set_thread_area(int entry, unsigned long base, int writeable)
instead?
