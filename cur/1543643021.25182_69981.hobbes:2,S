Hi Ingo,
Yes, like force_cpu_reschedule().
Apart from that RCU adds some minor things in the scheduler code -
1. Per-CPU context switch counter increment in the fast path
2. For preemptive kernels, a conditional branch in the voluntary
   context switch code path checking whether the current task may 
   have had an involuntary context switch earlier [rcu_preempt_put()].
3. Adding a field to the task structure - cpu_preempt_cntr.
4. RCU checking hook into the scheduler_tick(), but this is not
   in the fast path.
#2 and #3 are necessary to support call_rcu_preempt() which
allows preemption-safe reads of data protected by RCU. A preempted
task may still contain references to RCU protected data and
the RCU grace period needs to be prolonged until all such tasks
before the update do voluntary context switches.
I did some reflex benchmarking to make sure that I didn't introduce 
any false sharing by mistake in scheduler fast path and the results 
look comparable -
(4CPU P3 Xeon with 1MB L2 + 1GB RAM)
			vanilla-2.5.34	rcu_poll-2.5.34

Not sure how reliable these numbers are.
