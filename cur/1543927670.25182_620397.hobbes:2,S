Hi,
It seems to me that supplementary groups should be taken into account
when checking for permissions on a tun device.  Can someone comment on
my patch below; is it a reasonable approach?  If so, I'd like to
submit it for inclusion in the kernel under the GPL.
Please forward any responses to me directly in addition to the lkml.
Mike
