I see the problem, but if you want to be able to shrink memory to a
given size, then you must either introduce a hard limit somewhere, or
have the hypervisor hand out guest sized pages. Use zones, or Xen?

If there are zone rebalancing problems[*], then it would be great to
have more users of zones because then they will be more likely to get
fixed.
[*] and there are, sadly enough - see the recent patches I posted to
     lkml for example. But I'm fairly confident that once the particularly
     silly ones have been fixed, zone balancing will no longer be a
     derogatory term as has been thrown around (maybe rightly) in this
     thread!
