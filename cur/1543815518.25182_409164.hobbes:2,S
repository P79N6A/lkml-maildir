Quite possible.

Good idea, I'll try to benchmark it (on a slow CPU if I can find one :-) 
).  It will probably make no difference.
I don't want the lack of a fixed endianness on disk to become a problem. 
   I personally don't think the use of, or lack of a fixed endianness to 
be that important, but I'd prefer not to change the current situation 
and adopt a fixed format.  I use big endian systems almost exclusively, 
and I don't like the way fixed formats always tend to be little-endian.
