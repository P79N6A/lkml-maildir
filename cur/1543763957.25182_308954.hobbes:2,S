Will this be included in mainline anytime soon?  Kernel side seems to be
working great, and I think all issues was addressed.
The only real issues currently is with the gamin backend, but the
maintainer of gamin do not want to touch it until inotify is in
mainline, and John and others currently have other things to do.
