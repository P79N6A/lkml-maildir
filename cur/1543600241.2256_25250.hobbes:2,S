It's not that simple.  At the very least you need an equivalent of msync()
on each of these mappings before you can do anything of that kind.  In
effect, you are describing something very similar to revoke(2).  Which might
make sense, but I really doubt that it's a work for do_remount().
BTW, for real fun think of the situation when you have one of the swap
components in a regular file on your filesystem.  Do you seriously want
do_remount() to do automagical swapoff(2) on relevant swap components?
IMO it's a userland job.
