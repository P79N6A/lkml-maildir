Vojtect Pavlik added this kbd_exists code.
I'll ask him to take a look at this also.
I don't have the source code handy right now, but
I'll look at it tomorrow morning.
It does fit the timeframe of when the problem began.

Ok, one final suggestion:
 - the new "kbd_exists" logic in pc_kbd.c may be just completely buggered.
   It tries to notice when a PC-style keyboard is missing, and avoid
   trying to set the leds on it when no keyboard exists. Looks simple, but
   it may just not do the right thing, and it could conceivably result in
   the keyboard being left in a state where it got the command to switch
   the LED state, but never got the LED state bitmap it was expecting, so
   it would hang.
Could you who see the keyboard hang please do
 - tell me what kind of computer you have. Model, manufacturer, whatever
   seems relevant. I'd like to see if there is some pattern to it.
 - comment out the check for "kbd_exists" at the top of "send_data()" in
   drivers/char/pc_kbd.c (you can leave all the other references active,
   just remove the line that says
	if (!kbd_exists) return 0;
   which will disable that particular logic completely.
If that fixes it, then we have another clue.
