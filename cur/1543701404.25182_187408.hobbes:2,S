Afiak, we are current on udev :D  As for hotplug, I will have to check -
I see the latest usb patches cause usb.agent to complain about "09" not
valid token or such, but I have not looked into it yet.

Well, ideally you need baselayout-1.8.6.12-r3 as well ...  But if you
do have issues, try to bother me first, as it could be something I did
or did not do ;)

Hmm, It works fine here?  With sysfs patches from Greg (not yet into
official linux bk), I only had to run alsa's script to create device
nodes, and create /dev/{core,stdin,stdout,stderr} - the rest udev
creates - although, yes we do have the ramdisk/tarball feature to
save permissions/additions.
But once again, drop me a mail first with versions of udev, baselayout,
kernel, hotplug, etc, if you have latest unstable baselaout and still
cannot get it working - it is a Gentoo issue after all (as well as the
fact that I was under the impression that it should _just_work_ if you
have latest everything unstable =) ...
Thanks,
