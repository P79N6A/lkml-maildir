Hi Garrett,
Since you have provided generic backlight support for ASUS/IBM/Toshiba
acpi driver, which can reduce the unnecessary interface complexity in
platform specific acpi driver for brightness control, do you plan to do
same
thing for Ouptput switch, sound volume control..?  Moreover, do you
think the proposal below still make sense?
