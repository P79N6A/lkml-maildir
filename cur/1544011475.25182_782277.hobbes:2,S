Hi Mathieu,
   Complete agreement.
   I guess I'm biassed towards local_t == counter version, something else
== nmi-safe version because that's what it was originally.  Looking through
the tree, there are only 5 users: module, dmaengine and percpu_counter want
a counter, and tracing and x86 nmi.c want nmi-safe.  There are several other
places I know of which want local_t-the-counter.
   I'll prepare a patch which adds nmi_safe_t, and see how it looks.  There's
no amazing hurry on this, so I won't race to hit the merge window.
Thanks!
Rusty.
