It's often been suggested, and it's a long way down my TODO list, that we 
should have the facility to shift the kernel timer tick onto the RTC, thereby 
leaving the 8254 timer available for this kind of thing.
(We can't use the RTC because its range of frequencies is too restricted. It's 
fine for timer ticks, though.)
