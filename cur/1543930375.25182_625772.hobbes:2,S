It is a defacto standard for quite some time. Many motherboards
even come with builtin port 80 displays and port 80 cards are a standard
diagnostic tool. Pretty much all the of the standard BIOS
write diagnostic messages to port 80. While in theory a vendor
could change those BIOS they are pretty unlikely to do that.
Have you tried yet as someone asked earlier if using another 
free port that also leads to aborts causes the hang too?
If yes you would know for sure it is nothing on port 80,
but something not liking aborts (similar to the problem Eric B.
found earlier) 
Anyways using udelay is likely the way to go for modern
systems.

It is hard to know afterwards. In the past we definitely had systems
who needed such delays.  But some of it might be what you said.
