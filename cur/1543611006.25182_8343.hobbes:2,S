Interesting. I thought those two were basically identical VM-wise, so the
variance seems to be due to variance in the VM itself, not so much between
VM's.
The other numbers (ie total time etc) are fairly close, but the mp3
playing percentage seems to be inherently "unstable". Which is really
interesting in itself.
What happens to the MP3 numbers if you run it a few times on the exact
same kernel?
