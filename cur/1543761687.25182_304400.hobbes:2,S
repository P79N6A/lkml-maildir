It seems that the es1371 driver (which provides its own joystick port driver) 
is broken in at least 2.6.11-mm4. I don't know when it broke, but it used to 
work around in the 2.6.8/9 days (I haven't used the joystick in awhile). The 
hardware and joystick still both work (tested in Windows).
Where do I go from here?
