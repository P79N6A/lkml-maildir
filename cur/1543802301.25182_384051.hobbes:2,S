Drivers can choose to support this two different ways. One is to have a
buffer of kernel memory mapped into user space and shared with the
hardware (this is how OSS did it), the other is to use the 2.6
get_user_pages API to get the physical address of a set of pages and
lock them down so they don't wander off during DMA.
Both have advantages for different uses.
