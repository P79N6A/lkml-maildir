Huh.  I've just been trying to find a problem with events/1 spinning
after boot in current -git.  I was worried I'd introduced it, but looks
like there might be a wider problem.
I tracked it down to kernel/workqueue.c:run_workqueue(), where the while
(!list_empty(&cwq->worklist)) loop spins forever.  It turns out that the
list_empty test was failing, but cwq->worklist was pointing to itself
(iow, worklist.next points to a self-pointing list node).
I haven't found how it was getting into that state, but the use of
list_del_init(cwq->worklist.next) looks suspect to me.
Curiously, it seems to escape this loop after about 4-5mins, and then
seems well-behaved from then on.  And it doesn't always happen.
And, of course, no changes in kernel/workqueue.c since Feb, so whatever
changed was somewhere else, and I guess it could have affected kevent in
the same way.
It always seems to happen on the last CPU; when I run the kernel as Xen
guest with 4 vcpus, it happens on events/3.
