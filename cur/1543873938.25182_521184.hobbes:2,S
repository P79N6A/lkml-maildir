Dmitry,
Thanks for you feedback, sorry for the delay on my reply but because
I'm not subscribe to the list, only now I saw your message. I hope you
will be able to see that this message is a follow up on the previous ones.
If you do not mind can you please Cc directly to me.
Now to answer your questions.
The mouse do not works properly, I mean with this that I have the mouse
pointer on the screen, with gpm and X, but it jumps randomly when used.
I include below the output from the cat /proc/bus/input/devices, on my
actual kernel, 2.6.17-5, I can not include the one from the previous
kernel because I've reinstalled the system and I don't have at the moment
the possibility to run that previous kernel on the system. If necessary I
can try to install it again.
If you prefer that I subscribe to the list to make you followup's easyer
just let me know.
Thanks
Victor Fernandes

Does the mouse still work despite this message?

How was it identified by 2.6.12? Could you please send me output of
cat /proc/bus/input/devices on 2.6.12 and 2.6.17?
