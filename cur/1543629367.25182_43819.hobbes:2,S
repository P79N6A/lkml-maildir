Roughly speaking, the high memory (above 896MB phys) is mapped directly 
into user address spaces, mapped a page at a time into the kernel 
virtual address space via kmap and friends into a small window.
> Is possible to alocate more than 3GB for one process? 
Not really, you could shift the boundary to 3.5Gb or so in theory,
and eek out a little more, but in practice that just makes you
run out of kernel address space instead if you have enough memory
to make it worthwhile (unless you wanted the users pages swapped
out).
