Of course, every time a node fails.

SCTP isn't much different than TCP, so I'm not sure how that's relevant.
It's used primarily so we can take advantage of multi-homing when you have
redundant networks.
When the membership of a lockspace needs to change, whether adding or
removing a node, activity is suspended in that lockspace on all the nodes
using it.  After all are suspended, the lockspace is then told (on all
lockspace members) what the new membership is.  Recovery then takes place:
new masters are selected and waiting requests redirected.

We simply require that the membership system is in agreement before the
lockspace is told what the new members are.  The membership system
ultimately drives the lockspace membership and we can't have the
membership system on different nodes telling the dlm different stories
about who's in/out.
So, yes, the membership system ultimately needs to follow some algorithm
that guarantees agreement.  There are rigorous, distributed ways of doing
that (your evs work which I look forward to using), and simpler methods,
e.g.  driving it from some single point of control.

I've been using the command line program "dlm_tool" where I act as the
membership system myself.  We're just putting together pieces that will
drive this from a membership system (like openais).  Again, the pieces you
decide to use in userspace are flexible and depend on how you want to use
the dlm.

Neither SCTP nor the dlm are about cluster communication, they're both
about simple point-to-point messages.  When you move up to userspace and
start talking about membership, then the issue of group communication
models comes up and your openais/evs work is very relevant.  Might you be
misled about what SCTP does?
