Well this nearly killed me.  kernel-side proc handlers are ghastly things.
Could I have this reviewed please?  It surely has a hole in it somewhere.
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
If you try to read things like /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease with single-byte
reads, you get just one byte and then EOF.  This is because _proc_do_string()
assumes that the caller is read()ing into a buffer which is large enough to
fit the whole string in a single hit.
Fix.
