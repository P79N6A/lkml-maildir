Just my $.02 -
After futzing around with all the various patches
floating around, I've found the -aa releases to be
a pleasant surprise all around. I generally run -aa
on my home and office workstations, as well as
the web/mail/dns/squid/firewall servers I manage.
I find I get 95% of the benefits of the bleeding
edge, with 5% of the effort - for instance:
untar 2.4.18
apply 2.4.19-pre2 patch
apply 2.4.19-pre2aa1 patch *
configure, compile, boot and enjoy.
* for nvidia drivers, back out xfs and 20_pte-highmem patches
