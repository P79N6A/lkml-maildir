If it printed that, then how is it possible that it hung _before_ printing
that message???  Your reports are not making any sense to me.
Maybe that whole "if" block that turns that SMI _on_ is the problem; it
was part of the "early handoff" code, which came from who knows where,
was clearly buggy, and was never widely used until recently.  Enabling
the SMI seemed pretty dubious to me, but I suspect that some undescribed
buggy BIOS really does need it ... maybe whoever provided that "early"
handoff version could report what they were trying to do by enabling
the SMI?
