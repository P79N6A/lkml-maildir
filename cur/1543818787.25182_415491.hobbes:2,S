Hello,
There are two problems with the current release of LTP, therefore I 
updating the release from yesterday and re-releasing it.
   - The patch to /lib/parse_opts.c was removed because it was causing 
testcases writev01 - 05 and ftest06 to fail.
   - Also, I removed an additional ltp directory located in the top LTP 
directory that was unnecessary.
