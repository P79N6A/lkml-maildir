   So theory is therefore that the HZ rate was taken from what Digital
   UNIX was using and applied without further thought.
One further theory, from the networking perspective, is that a higher
resolution HZ allows you to use more accurate timestamping in TCP and
thus get more accurate round trip estimates.  I don't know if the
Digital people had specifically thought about this at the time.
I had considered the issue of using a larger HZ value on UltraSparc,
but:
1) I only did so way after I had the foundation of the port almost
   done
2) The desire to run as many existing 32-bit Sparc binaries as
   possible without recompilation precluded things a bit
