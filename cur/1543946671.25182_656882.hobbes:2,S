It's called the memory controller since it controls the amount of memory that a
user can allocate (via limits). The generic term for any resource manager
plugged into cgroups is a controller. If you look through some of the references
in the document, we've listed our plans to support other categories of memory as
well. Hence it's called a memory controller

This has some history as well. Control groups was called containers earlier.
That way a name like CGROUP_MEM_CONT could stand for cgroup memory container or
cgroup memory controller.

The references, specially reference [1] contains a lot of details on limits,
guarantees, etc.  Since they've been documented in the past on lkml, I decided
to keep them out of the documentation and mention them as references. If it's
going to help to add that terminology; I can create another document describing
what resource management means and what the commonly used terms mean.
