I bet if you did a double blind test (users not knowing if they
run with RT patch or not or think they are running with patch when they
are not) they would report the same. 
Basically when people go through all that effort of applying
a patch then they really want to see an improvement. If it is there
or not.
You surely have seen that with other patches when users
suddenly reported something worked better/smoother with a new
release etc and there was absolutely no explanation for it in the changed
code.
I have no reason to believe this is any different with all
this RT testing.
