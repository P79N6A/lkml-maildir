Hi,
following up on the firmware loading problems in 2.6.21-rc4-mm1, I've
been looking into uevent_suppress and using it in the firmware class.
As an added bonus, I also managed to suppress some unwanted uevents on
s390.
Works for me on i386 (the firmware stuff) and on s390 (the subchannel
stuff).
Patches are against 2.6.21-rc5-mm1.
[1/3] Driver core: suppress uevents via filter.
[2/3] Driver core: switch firmware_class to uevent_suppress.
[3/3] s390: cio: Delay uevents for subchannels.
