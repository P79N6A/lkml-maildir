Dave, this has been a problem since the out_of_memory() function was 
changed
between 2.6.10 and 2.6.11.  Before this change out_of_memory() required 
multiple
calls within 5 seconds before actually OOM killed a process.  After the 
change(in 2.6.11)
a single call to out_of_memory() results in OOM killing a process.  The 
following patch
allows the 2.6.18 system to run under much more memory pressure before 
it OOM kills.
