I've just begun reading your reply.  A quick note on the name "cpusets".
Yes, it is a bit misleading.
On SGI's Irix, they are 'cpusets'.  On SGI's 2.4 Linux kernels, the
kernel portion is called 'cpumemsets', and the user support 'cpusets'. 
Independently, Simon of Bull chose 'cpusets'.  For a while, I was
lobbying Simon to change it to 'cpumemsets', then I decided to heck with
it, as the shorter, sweeter name seemed to be the more commonly used.
