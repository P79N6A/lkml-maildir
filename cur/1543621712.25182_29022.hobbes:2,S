OTOH, having exclusive copyright means you can more successfully defend that
copyright. If someone took a copy of the linux kernel and used it in a
blatently non-GPL compliant way, who could sue?
From the FSF website:  If there are multiple authors of a copyrighted work,
successful enforcement depends on having the cooperation of all authors.
All the authors of the linux kernel? That would be more difficult than
herding Debian developers.
Since I don't think anyone has registered the copyright for the kernel
no-one would be eligable for statutory damages and actual damages is zero.
The Samba Team ran into exactly this problem. The Linux kernel lucky because
public opinion is in its favour.
Not that I think the FSF's way is necessarily the right way, but it is not
without merit.
