Subject: [PATCH] select() says closed socket readable
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Whoa! It isn't that select/poll is saying that a read wouldn't
block. It's saying that the socket has been hung up (POLLHUP
not POLLIN)! This is even worse - POLLHUP is always tested
for even of the user didn't ask for it. So if an unconnected
socket appears _anywhere_ in a select or poll we are heading
for spin city, regardless of whether we asked for read, write,
errors or even nothing (in the case of poll)!
Older Linux kernels (2.2.18 at least) blocked on unconnected
TCP sockets but returned POLLHUP on unix sockets. Current
kernels return POLLHUP in both cases. It looks like TCP was
fixed to match unix instead of vice-versa.
A quick poll (<grin>) of available machines here show that
both Sun and FreeBSD block for both TCP and unix unconnected
sockets.
The attached patch _should_ be applied :-).
