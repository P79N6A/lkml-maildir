Ok, it's happening about every 20 minutes now.  Is there anything I can
do to try and fix or at least give some clues that lead to an answer.
Customers aren't liking this too much if you know what I mean.  We
have about a week we have to wait before we're able to move this to
another server that will be using hardware raid. 
Thanks
