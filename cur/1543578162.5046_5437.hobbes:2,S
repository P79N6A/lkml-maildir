Just boxes that were already short on memory (swapped a lot) will need
more swap, empirically up to 4 times as much. If you already had
enough memory than things will stay almost the same for you.
But anyway, after some testing I've done recently I would now not
recommend anybody to have less than 2 x RAM size swap partition.

Well, if you continue with that practice now you will be even more
successful in killing such processes, I would say. :)
