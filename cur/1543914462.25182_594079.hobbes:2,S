Ahh, silly me... Of course!
Ooops, I just got back, and verified: I actually have sata_nv running as 
a module after all on this server... My bad.
I fixed /etc/modprobe.conf to include the following two lines:
"
alias scsi_hostadapter sata_nv
options sata_nv adma=0
...
"
I then ran "mkinitrd" (to ensure that the latest options from 
modprobe.conf were included) in the initrd-image that I load at boot.
- Do you guys think this is worth a try? Anyway, I have rebooted now, so 
I'll test it for a few days and let you know - We'll just have to wait 
and see...
Do you think I should re-enable SMART to provoke a failure, or would 
that be to tempt fate too much? (For now I have not re-enabled SMART)
PS: Is there any way of testing / verifying that sata_nv is now running 
with this option? - I am pretty sure I have done it correctly, but I 
would still like to confirm that the proper option has been passed if 
possible.
Thanks
Jon Ivar
