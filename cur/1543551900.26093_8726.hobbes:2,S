The standard is careful to avoid implementation/ABI issues.
It doesn't specify the use of a stack at all.
Nonetheless, there exists a C convention for stack based
archs, which is as I described. Pascal convention can
accomodate varargs by indirection, but that is OT.
My point was that stack order of values is independent of
the order of evaluation.
gcc is neither dumb nor psychic. It will not honor a
sequence point which exists only in the programmer's head.
