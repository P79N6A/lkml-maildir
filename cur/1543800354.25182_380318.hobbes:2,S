How about below arrangement for default values?
1) physical_package_id: If cpu has no physical package id, the logical cpu id will be picked up.
2) core_id: 0. If cpu doesn't support multi-core, its core id is 0. 
3) thread_siblings: Just include itself, if the cpu doesn't support HT/multi-thread.
4) core_siblings: Just include itself, if the cpu doesn't support multi-core and HT.

On I386/x86_64/IA64, MADT, an ACPI table, provides apic id for all cpus. But we can't divide it to get core id and thread id becasue we couldn't know how many bits of apic id are for core id and how many bits are for thread id. These info are got only by executing cupid (on i386/x86_64) or PAL call (on ia64) by the online cpu itself.

Based on above discussion, if the attributes of the cpu is not removed when the cpu is offline, the attribute values might be incorrect when the cpu is not up since machine boots.
