So the choice is to use the 3.x compiler which has issues as well as
generating slow code, or to not be able to generate a decent error report
if something doesn't work right, rip the half-assed check out, or just use
2.4 kernels.
The problem is that it gets ALL fixed compilers in the 2.96 family, only a
few are broken, and it seems safe to assume that people who are building
test kernels probably have upgraded their compiler.
