The John Osterhout presentation is a very sane and balanced assessment of the
value of select based programming versus threads - recommended reading. I had
a similar presentation of my own once, but his is better so I threw mine
away. The only issue he doesn't adequately address is the scalability
limitation of select in multi-CPU environments. I guess it was written some
time ago, when multi-CPU systems were less significant. Perhaps he should
update it to give a properly balanced view for 1999's systems.
