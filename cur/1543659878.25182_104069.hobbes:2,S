At least in theory, there should be *nothing* that can happen in user space
that will kill the kernel.  However, in practice, if a program is running
as root, it can definitely blortch things up.  This is mostly due to the
assumption that the root user has a clue, and that if they are (for instance)
opening /proc/kcore for writing, that they know what they're doing.  Similarly,
if a program opens /dev/hda1 for writing and scribbles over the superblock,
it may be a bit difficult to mount the filesystem.
So in general, yes, the root user can screw things up in the kernel.  On the
other hand, the root user can also 'rm -rf /' which doesn't require any
extraordinary kernel assistance, just the unlink() system call.  The only
solution here is to not give root to clueless bozos, and to take regular
backups. ;)
