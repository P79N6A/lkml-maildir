I came across this "Gentle Introduction" on www.x86-64.org :
"Gentle Introduction to x86-64 Assembly "
http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/assembly
 :
Where the most striking remark is this :
"This document is meant to summarise differences between x86-64 and i386 
assembly assuming that you already know well the i386 gas syntax. I will try 
to keep this document up to date until official documentation is available."
Amazing stuff! How can one manufacture full-functional x86_64 AMD64 and
Opteron CPU's in silicon print, while the white-paper print of the "official
documentation" on assembly programming on x86_64 is NOT available ??

Robert
