I don't have spec to hand to quote, but at least 10 years ago the SIGBUS
beyond end of file was required behaviour, on both MAP_SHARED and more
surprisingly MAP_PRIVATE mappings of a file.  Well, you don't get SIGBUS
on any part of the page that covers the end of the file: perhaps what
you read as undefined in the spec is addressing that tail page issue.
We guarantee it: it's a kernel bug if it doesn't work.
