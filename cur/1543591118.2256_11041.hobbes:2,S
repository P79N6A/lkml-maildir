The thing being, why thet hell create these device/directory hybrids?
Driver can export a tree and we mount it on fb0. After that you have
the whole set - yes, /dev/fb0/colourspace, etc. - no problem. And no
need to do mknod, BTW. Yes, we'll need to use /dev/fb0/frame for
frame itself. BFD...
You see, as soon as you want slightly more structured stuff (deeper than
one level) you need the dentry tree, yodda, yodda. IOW, you need a
filesystem anyway and it's easy to implement. Want me to do framebufferfs?
Would make a nice demo.  No majors. No minors. No ioctls. Less code than
in current tree.  ~3 days to implement.
