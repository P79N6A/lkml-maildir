Subject: PID entries in /proc sorted by number, not start time in 2.6.19

Starting with kernel 2.6.19, the process directories in
/proc are sorted by number. They were sorted by process
start time in 2.6.18 and earlier. This makes the output
of procps come out in that order too, pissing off users
who are used to the old way.
To reproduce:
	1. Wrap your PID numbers.
	2. Do ls -fl /proc
	3. Look at output of ps command.
Compare 2.6.18 to 2.6.19.
