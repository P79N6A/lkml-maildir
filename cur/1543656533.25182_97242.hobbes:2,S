No, it's my fault - I was skimming through list traffic, and not
concentrating, (proof of this is the fact that I've had sendmail
configured incorrectly all day, and been posting from the wrong
address, and only just realised :-) ).
I saw Larry mention kernel.bkbits.net, and Alan say, "We've got one -
its called linux-kernel", (in a separate message without quoting
anything, so it's really your fault :-) :-) :-) ), and assumed that a
BK argument was imminent, and I made a joke comment that it, (an
argument), was not a 2.6 required feature.
Sorry about the wasted bandwidth, I'll stop posting as it's now past
midnight, and I obviously need sleep.
Oh, 2.4.20-pre2 compiled OK for me, I hope that proves I've done
something useful tonight.
John.
