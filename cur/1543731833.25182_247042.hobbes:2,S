Here is an interesting interview of Dominic Giampaolo and Benoit
Schillings regarding the structure of BeFS.  Some interesting issues
regarding how queries were done.

BTW: I get paid during the day to do security engineering work.
Wouldn't parsing the query in the kernel make the kernel susceptible to
buffer overflows?  Bad place to have an overflow.
