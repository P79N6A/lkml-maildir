My point of view is rather different.
If a user has union-mounts then probably she knows what she is doing.
I'll leave finding the most suitable semantics to you.
But we must not have gazillions of people upgrading 2.2 to 2.4
complaining: mount is broken, umount is broken - I just unmounted
and it is still there! The 
	"Return EBUSY if mount is called with the same filesystem
	 on the same mount point (without the -o remount flag)"
is the minimum requirement on the kernel so that people with
old mount programs will not be very confused. Especially with
a GUI it is very easy to click twice on the "mount foo" button,
and nobody expects foo to be mounted twice.
It must go in before 2.4.
