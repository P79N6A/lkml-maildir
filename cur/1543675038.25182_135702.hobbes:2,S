Sure, I understand that, but what I'm really complaining about is the
text of the prompt.  When I do a 'make menuconfig' it's alot cleaner
and more understandable what's happening here.
Part of the problem is the specification in arch/i386/Kconfig, which I
think needs to be re-worked.  
In my case, I specified that the max number of CPUS is 2, since I only
have a dual CPU box.  So it's not a BIGCPU box.  Not sure how to make
this change... I'll have to find some time and play with this.

I see that when I dod the menuconfig, it's not clear at all when
running oldconfig.
