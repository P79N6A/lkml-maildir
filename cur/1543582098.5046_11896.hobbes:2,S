It wouldn't be able to detect collisions, I suspect; you might be able to
get data through, though. Not something I've ever wanted to try :-)

On a crossover cable direct between two machines, that would make sense:
you would WANT both cards full duplex, but if one ran half duplex instead,
it would think it was getting a huge number of collisions when it
wasn't...

Ouch! Remember each collision only knocks out a few hundred bytes -
perhaps 1.5K - so even hundreds of collisions per second only knock a few
hundred K/sec off a transfer rate of ten Mbyte/sec or so.

Well, mine do anyway :-)
(Except under the Win2k bug, where I needed to force the link to 100
Mbit/sec full duplex...)
