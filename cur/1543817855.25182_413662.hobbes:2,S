Attn/ Please 
Good day to you and your lovely family. I am Mr. Yassan Ali-Fayadh, the son of Late Sheikh Dhari Ali Al-Fayadh 
(Prominent Iraq's House of Assembly Member) who was killed along with three of his bodyguards and my Bother 
in a suicide bomb attack in the neighborhood of Rashdiya Northern Baghdad. Please view the news in CNN 
website below for detail Story of how I lost my Father and My Bother.

My late Father deposited a huge amount with Company here in Dakar Senegal. I got your contact detail from a friend 
in the neighbour and have so much in trust in you. All I need from you is an assistance to transfer the fund my late Father 
deposited to your country for investment until I regain my freedom. I will give you 32% of the total sum but most of all is that 
I solicit your trust in this transaction and will not want you to betray me, and I also want you to know that is a legitimate 
transaction and which is total risk free and we both will benefit from it. Please all correspondence should be directed to 
my private email: yassan3@maktoob.com as await your reply soon.
Yours sincerely, 
Mr. Yassan Al-Fayadh.
