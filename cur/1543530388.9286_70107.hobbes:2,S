Yes... So if you disabled overcommit, AND used a malloc wrapper which
touches every page when it is allocated, you could guarantee the memory
you had been "allocated" was REALLY allocated.
Anyway, this all has nothing to do with the original topic, which related
to how to handle out-of-memory situations - i.e. once all the memory has
been allocated, however you allocate it.
