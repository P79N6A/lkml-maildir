That was my gut feel too.  However, it seems from Carsten and Jörn
discussion of read/write XIP on Flash (and some new Phase Change)
memories that having the struct pages has a lot of potential benefits.
 Wouldn't it also allow most of the mm routines to remain unchanged.
I just worry that it would be difficult to set apart these non
volitatile pages that can't be written too directly.

But that's handled by ioremap()ing it right?
