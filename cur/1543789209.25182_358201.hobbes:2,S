Subject: [RFC] RNG rewrite...

I want to add support for the RNG on Intel's IXP4xx NPU and 
looking at the existing hw-random.c code, it is written with
the assumption that the RNG is on the PCI bus. I can put a
big #ifdef ARCH_IXP4XX in there but instead I would rather
rewrite the damn thing to use the device model and have a rng
device class with individual drivers for each RNG model, including
IXP4xx. I'll keep the miscdev interface around but will add a
new interface under /sys/class/rng that the userspace tools 
can transition to. Is this OK with folks?
One question I have is about the following comment:
 * This data only exists for exporting the supported
 * PCI ids via MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE.  We do not actually
 * register a pci_driver, because someone else might one day
 * want to register another driver on the same PCI id.
Why? Is there something else on those IDs that another driver might
care about?
Tnx,
~Deepak
