Are you proposing to put this facility in the kernel? There's already
a perfectly good userspace program to do that - take a peek at
`man hwclock` for details.

There are quite a few people don't bother replying to mailing list
postings that state the poster isn't subscribed to the list, on the
basis of "if (s)he can't be bother to subscribe, I can't be bothered
to reply"...
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
