this is definitely broken code. Such code already causes big CPU
overhead in certain circumstances (under 2.4 too) - but in 2.6 it also
shows up as an interactivity problem. So 2.4 hid the problem, 2.6
exposes it.

yeah. pwlib should be fixed. The quick fix is, instead of sched_yield(),
to do:
	{
		struct timespec timer = { 0, 1 };
		nanosleep (&timer, NULL);
	}
this does what pwlib really wants to do: sleep for the shortest amount
of time posssible, because its semaphore implementation is polling
based.
(but pwlib should perhaps use sem_timedwait(sem, abs_timeout) instead -
which does exactly what PSemaphore::Wait() tries to implement.)
