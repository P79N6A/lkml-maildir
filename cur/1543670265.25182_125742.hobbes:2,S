I think this makes too many assumptions specially taking into
account that most hotplug stuff are shell scripts - they are
probably going to be writing all kinds of stuff to stdout.
With the risk of repeating myself (again) and being a PITA,
I really think it'd be easier to copy the firmware file to a 
/sysfs binary file registered by the device driver during 
initialization; then the driver can wait for the file to be
written with a valid firmware before finishing the init
sequence. The infrastructure is already there (or isn't ... 
is it?).
