Yeah but that's far better than adding bunch of 'not a leak' annotations 
around the kernel which is very impractical to maintain.  I would like to 
see your leak detector in the kernel so we can finally get rid of all 
those per-subsystem magic allocators.  This patch, however, is 
unacceptable for inclusion IMHO.
