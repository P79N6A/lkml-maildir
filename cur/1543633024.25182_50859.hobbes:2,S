No, we delete them from the list (list_del_init) so we can't find it
again: ie. futex_wake can't be invoked twice on the same thing without
someone putting it back on the queue...

I don't think the complexity is much worse: async is inherently
complex given that there are no real in-kernel primitives to do offer
both sync and async cleanly.  Having two incompatible primitives would
be painful, too.
