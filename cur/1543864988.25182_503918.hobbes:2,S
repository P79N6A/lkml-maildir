Ok, it would still be interesting to hear what triggered this.
There's really only two initramfs-related changes in the whole 2.6.20 
development series that I can see, and neither of them are even _remotely_ 
likely to cause this, afaik. We have:
 - commit 8d610dd52dd1da696e199e4b4545f33a2a5de5c6
   "Make sure we populate the initroot filesystem late enough"
(but "late enough" is still _way_ before we actually mount it, so ..) and
 - commit 2e591bbc0d563e12f5a260fbbca0df7d5810910e
   "Make initramfs printk a warning on incorrect cpio type"
and the latter is just a build-time sanity-check.
Since 2.6.18, there's been a couple more, but none of them look even 
remotely likely either. Which is why it really would be good if you can 
"git bisect" this behaviour.
There _was_ a hardlink-related thing some time ago, but that was back in 
May, and before 2.6.18. So if it worked for you in 2.6.18, I don't see 
that being it.
I've added some initramfs people to the Cc: in case somebody has better 
ideas, but in the absense of that, it really would be good to do that 
bisection. Also, you might want to double-check that your cpio actually 
generates a good initramfs image (it that it's not some user-mode upgrade 
that caused it to stop working).
