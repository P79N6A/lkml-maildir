I already described why.  Examples are DMA boundary and s/g limit, among 
others.  When confronted with this, you proposed an additional hardware 
information struct which duplicates Scsi_Host_Template.
Solution?  Just use Scsi_Host_Template.  Take a look at how each libata 
driver is implemented.  The host template is in the low level driver, 
while most of the code is common code, implemented elsewhere.

Your current code is much closer to the desired end result, as it 
separates out SAS common code.  That's why its being used as a base.
