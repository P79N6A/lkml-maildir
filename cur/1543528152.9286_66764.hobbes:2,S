If you do anything else than Windows-based pure client apps you very
quickly need static addresses.
I've worked in an institution where addresses were assigned
dynamically, no working DNS available and certain privileges (access
to critical servers) were assigned _by IP address_. On some days we
had to work more on getting basic networking running again and
especially the confusion over IP addresses resolved than doing our
development work. No thanks.
Of course it would be possible to do this all with a correctly
functioning dynamic DNS based setup, but unless Window$ 200x does this
out of the box and does it _right_ this won't happen in the real world.
