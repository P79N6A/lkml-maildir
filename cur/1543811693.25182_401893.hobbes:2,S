Thank you for your advice. I will re-create an additional patch
against recent -mm tree.

I'm sorry. It's my fault. The first hunk is just a degradation.

This change is important. Because NX-protection support patch makes
the ainsn.insn a pointer instead of a data structure, so now (&p->ainsn.insn)
means just an address of the pointer -- not the instruction address.

OK. I will get the latest -mm tree and test it.
And I will re-send the patch ASAP.
