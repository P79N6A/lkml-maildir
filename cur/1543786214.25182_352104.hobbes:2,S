Note that than you should use the _name_ caching part, ie the 
fsnotify_nameremove() part of the equation. That part is unambiguous.
It's literally only the "inode" things (IN_DELETE_SELF) that are
questionable. And that's fundamentally because the "self" can live on for
_longer_ than the name that points to it.
I really think that the patch I sent out yesterday is as good as it gets.  
If you want immediate notification, you should ask for notification about
name changes in a particular directory. IN_DELETE_SELF notification on a
file simple is _not_ going to be immediate.
