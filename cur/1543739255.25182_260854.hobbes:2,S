Your insmod may need updating (the one used by initrd).
As you can see, it was unable to load even the first
module necessary to eventually access your root file-system.
The new kernel has QUERY_MODULES removed (don't ask why, normally
there would be some kind of compatibility-overlap). So, your
older `insmod` or `insmod.static` is trying to use the old-
method of loading modules.
[SNIPPED...]
You may not be able to recover easily. I found that I needed
to rebuild the kernel with the necessary SCSI drivers in the
kernel. This would allow me to boot and mount a root file-system.
Save the previous kernel ".config" file. You must rebuild
with the 'loop' device in the kernel as well (or else you
can't make a new initrd RAM disk).
Then you can install the new modutils package.
Then you can change back to the previous configuration with
`make clean ; make oldconfig`....etc. Rebuild the kernel,
install and boot happy.
Cheers,
