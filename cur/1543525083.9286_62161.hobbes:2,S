Allow me to second this suggestion. In the present state capabilities are
useless on Linux as a means of privilege isolation, since they can't be
used by anyone besides root on any standard Linux distribution.
I was thinking of system calls along the lines of sys_setsecurebits() and
sys_getsecurebits(), along with a capability to allow changes.
Your solution sounds like a much better approach.
I want to be able to start a daemon, drop all capabilities except the one
I need, and then setuid() to a non-privileged user.
Linux needs your patch!
Thanks,
Chris Wing
