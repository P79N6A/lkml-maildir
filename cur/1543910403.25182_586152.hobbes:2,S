Okay. Just had to ask. That looked so odd...

There is a short description of the desired semantics in the link that was 
posted:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/18/228
===
The user now is allowed to send packages if either his euid or his egid
matches the one specified via tunctl (via -u or -g respecitvely). If both
gid and uid are set via tunctl, both have to match.
===
Paraphrasing the original code above, it's saying:
if ((owner_is_set && does_not_match) || (group_is_set && does_not_match))
	bugger_off_unless(CAP_NET_ADMIN);
or reverting the logic:
if ((owner_is_unset || does_match) && (group_is_unset || does_match))
	good_to_go();
which probably matches the intention -- we're good to go only if the 
credentials that are set also match.
