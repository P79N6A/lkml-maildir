Do make mrproper or at least 
rm -f /usr/src/linux/include/linux/modules/*; make dep
before changing configuration from CONFIG_SMP=n to CONFIG_SMP=y or back.
I've posted a patch to solve this recently, but Linus probably thought it is
not a showstopper (it is not, but it is annoying), so he didn't apply it to
2.2.1.
Cheers,
