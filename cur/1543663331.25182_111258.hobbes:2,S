Well, part of the problem (I think) is that you added all the threads to 
the same main directory.
Putting a "." in front of the name doesn't fix the /proc level directory
scalability issues, it only means that you can avoid some of the user- 
level scalability ones.
So to offset that bad design, you then add other cruft, like the lookup
cursor and the "." marker. Which is not a bad idea in itself, but I claim
that if you'd made the directory structure saner you wouldn't have needed
it in the first place.
It would just be _so_ much nicer if the threads would show up as 
subdirectories ie /proc/<tgid>/<tid>/xxx. More scalable, more readable, 
and just generally more sane.
