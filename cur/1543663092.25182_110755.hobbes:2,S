Subject: [ANNOUNCE] 2.5 kernel errata list
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Based on a suggestion and several people saying they would find it
useful, I'm keeping a kernel errata page on the Linux Test Project
website at 
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/errata
I'll try to maintain a list of known fixes for blocking problems with
the most recent kernel on this page.  By "blocking", I mean anything
severe enough to keep you from testing the kernel (can't compile, panic
on boot, catches your hair on fire, etc).  This is _not_ a replacement
for the bug tracking system.  I won't put anything here that doesn't
have a fix or a workaround.  So if you're looking for an exhaustive list
of problems for a given kernel, look at bugme, but if all you want is a 
list of known fixes to get you up and running quickly, the errata list
should give you a quick and easy answer.
If you have any suggestions to make this more useful or if you see
anything I've missed, please let me know.
Thanks,
Paul Larson
