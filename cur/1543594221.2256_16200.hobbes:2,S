If tux will ever be merged into mainline eventually I don't think
there's a value in defer such bit. Of course if tux will never get
merged then I totally agree with you.

Then you may prefer to wait tux to be merged before merging the rest as
well, in the meantime 90% of the kernels running out there will show
such stuff out of /proc/stats (hopefully "the same stuff" which is why
I'm posting those patches in first place).
