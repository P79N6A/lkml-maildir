Hey - it's already there.  That makes life very easy - ->next() should
do the following:
	if (resource->child)
		return resource->child;
	while (!resource->sibling) {
		resource = resource->parent;
		if (!resource)
			return NULL;
	}
	return resource->sibling;
AFAICS that should be it - walks the tree in right order.  Depth can be
trivially found by ->show(), so there's no problems either...
