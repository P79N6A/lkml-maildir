When I proposed to autogenerate it I recalled it was a list of files,
including paths. But it is only basename used for matching.
So generating the list from within kbuild is too unsafe. There will most
likely be false negatives.
The following patch generate a list of filenames only, straight from
the kbuild Makefiles. I did not include patterns from the find
used in the top-level Makefile.
Usage: make KBUILD_DONTDIFF=1 clean
As can be seen wildcards is used in a few places
and the list of filenames generated is much bigger than included
in dontdiff today (341 files).
So I have changed my mind - do not autogenerate it. Stuff in the dontdiff
file somewhere (scripts/?).
