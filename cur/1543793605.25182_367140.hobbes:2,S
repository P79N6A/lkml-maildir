The cpu delay data collected by schedstats (which is jiffies based)
is normalized to nanosecs. The timestamps based on sched_clock() are exported
as is. As Marcelo pointed out, thats not good enough since sched_clock() itself
could return jiffie-based resolution.  So some normalization will be needed for
that data as well.
