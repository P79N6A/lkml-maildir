That was never true in Arjan's patches.
The only change is from a gcc version check to a feature check.
In both cases, a gcc 4.1 without the appropriate patch applied will 
result in this option not being set.

If an option might possible have zero effect, we do always inform the 
user. If not, please tell me which options this are so we can fix them.
We don't inform users about internal compiler version dependent things 
like -fno-unit-at-a-time on i386 with neither a config option nor any 
user visible effect (except for kernel size and speed).
