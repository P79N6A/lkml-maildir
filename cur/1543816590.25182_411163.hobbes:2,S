Subject: [PATCH] sched: protect calculation of max_pull from integer wrap
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Problem:
As the comment above the calculation of max_pull in the function states, 
there is a need to ensure that negative results of the subtractions do 
not wrap around to large numbers.  This has not been implemented for the 
(max_load - busiest_load_per_task) expression and the possible 
consequences are for undesirable movement of tasks from one group to 
another group. E.g. consider a numa system with two nodes, each
node containing four processors.  If there are two processes in node-0 
and with node-1 being completely idle,  one of those processes will be 
moved to node-1 whereas the desired behavior is to retain those two 
processes in node-0.
Fix:
Make sure that max_load is greater than busiest_load_per_task before 
making the calculation.  If it isn't max_pull will be zero and we skip 
directly to out_balanced.
