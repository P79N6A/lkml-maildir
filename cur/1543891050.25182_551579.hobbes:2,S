I'd be perfectly happy with killing support for using ->read.  Any
simple filesystem can use the generic methods, and any more complex
filesystem should better have splice aswell.  Btw, someone should
look into using splice for the loop write path aswell, the current
useage of ->prepare_write and ->commit_write has similar locking
problems aswell.
