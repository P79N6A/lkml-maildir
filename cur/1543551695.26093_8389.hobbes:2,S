Ok, I read it and here is the paragraph, which refers to IVs:
-------------snip-------------------------------------------------------
      RECOMMENDATION 10: Each transform should fully specify one partic-
      ular function (though this function may be probabilistic or state-
      ful).  For example, if one has a mechanism like DES-CBC, one must
      specify how the initialization vector is to be selected.
   The reason for this recommendation is experience that indicates that
   if a transform is not completely specified, implementors will not
   know how to finish the "missing pieces" in a way that is cryptograph-
   ically correct.  As an example, it is not true that CBC encryption
   can use an arbitrary nonce initialization vector: it is essential
   that the IV be unpredictable by the adversary.  (To see this, suppose
   the IV is  a sequence number: 0, 1, 2, ... .  Then a (first) encryp-
   tion of 0x0000000000000000 followed by an encryption of
   0x0000000000000001 is recognizably distinct from a (first) encryption
   of 0x0000000000000000 followed by an  encryption of
   0x0000000000000000.  Clearly this violates violates the notion of a
   secure encryption sketched in Section 2.)
-------------snip-------------------------------------------------------
So I think what is written in "Applied Cryptography" (by Bruce Schneier)
is correct. A sequence is ok, as long as you can't predict the start
of the sequence. 
The key sentence in the above statement is:
"It is essential that the IV be unpredictable by the adversary"
If I understand this correctly it means that you CAN use a
simple increasing sequence, as long as you make sure that the
start value of the sequence is unknown.
A simple implementation (which doesn't affect loop.c, but only
the ciphers) is to calculate an IVseed from the key and use
an addition of "IVseed" + "block/sector number" as IV for
the encryption of one block/sector. (This is simplified a
version of the approach suggested by David Wagner.
He suggested to encrypt the block/sector number and
then use the the encrypted sector number as IV.
This seems even more secure, but if the above paragraph
is correct than simply using a sequence, which starts at 
an unpredictable point should be enough... Comments ?)
so long

PS: I plan to put a revised implementation and patch set of Twofish
    on my homepage "
http://www.in.tum.de/~rohloff".
 Please have a look
    at the description of the above scheme in my twofish implementation.
    I would like to hear some comments about it...
    I will do a second version, which implements David Wagners approach,
    because after some though I think the performance degradation is less
    than I expected at a first glance...
