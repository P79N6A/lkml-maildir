I tried Option "NoRPM" with XFree86 4.0.1 and it seems to have fixed the
problem!  Yay!  Closing lid: suspend happens after a few beeps.  Open
lid, computer resumes and is working normally.  I guess the new code in
XFree86 was problematic.  Perhaps it's fixed in 4.0.2, but I haven't
tried that.
I've noticed other changes in suspend/resume.  I'm running Gnome now,
and it insists on running xscreensaver whenever I close the lid.
Somehow it is noticing the APM event, because this is very consistent.
Does anyone know how to disable this?  The setting "No screensaver"
under the list of screensavers didn't help -- it just runs a blank
screensaver which is even more confusing, because the computer appears
not to have resumed (when it's just a black screensaver).
cheers,
