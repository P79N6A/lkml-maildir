I disagree most definitely. 90% of the people moving into Linux nowdays
don't make use of the CD of source code. A fair number of them understand
what it is about and why it matters. 
Binaries/source is nothing but a packaging issue. If Debian came as a CD
of sources only with nothing but a kernel, libc and gcc/binutils compiled
it wouldn't work either
