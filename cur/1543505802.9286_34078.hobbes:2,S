I have a similiar setup haunting me under 2.2.11:
Two SMP servers with 3Com 3c905 NICs. Server1 has one secondary IP address,
Server2 has  two secondary  IP addresses.  Both are  connected to  the same
100MBit-Switch with autonegotiation turned off. Now what happens:
Right after reboot of Server2 everything works but soon after Server1 will
not be able to reach Server2's primary address, all secondary addresses still
work and none of the other hosts (Linux and non-Linux) are experiencing any
problems.  The ARP cache shows entries for all IP addresses of Server2.
Deleting the ARP entry for the primary address of Server2 will fail with an
error message that the network is down (which obviously is bogus).
Yours,
