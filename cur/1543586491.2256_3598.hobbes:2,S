It is a very good idea, and to implement quite easy. You just do have to
diff between three types of video cards (MDA, MGA and HGC vs. CGA and AGA vs. EGA+).
Then you do direct register writes. For the HGC I did it recently in a DOS proggy
which switched from text to gfx and back. I had a TSR which simulated a gfx BIOS.
Only problem is, I lost the source. But I could rewrite and test it on request.
I even would put it under GPL for the kernel (normally this is a no-no for me),
just ask me. I will write it in NASM then because I can't the AT&T syntax.
For non-i386 Platforms I do not know about this topic. (IIRC the Apples didnt
even have a text mode)
Maybe I could look up the EGA register values somewhere.
