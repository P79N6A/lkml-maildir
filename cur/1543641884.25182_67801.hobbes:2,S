 absolugtely correct. My main grief wrt. responsiveness of desktop 
systems is when the VM decides to grow the cache at the cost of pushing 
parts of KDE into swap. As a result, "activating" windows that I 
haven't touched for some time takes noticeable delays, which ruins the 
interactiveness.
 My best setup for this is to have lots of memory and disable swap (and 
live with the consequences- eg. triggering the OOM killer).
 Admittedly, things seem to be much better now than six month ago.
