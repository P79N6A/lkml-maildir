Because my English is not good enough to explain what I mean in the short
question I wrote :)
I don't say they have to be shipped seperately, but if they are separated,
they can be handled like normal high-priority tasks, swapped out if
unused, delivered by manufacturers seperately of the kernel and kernel
version independent (more or less at least). Besides, by treating
drivers as tasks, it is sometimes possible to keep a system alive if a
driver crashes. (Though a real crash is still a real crash...), 
providing better stability.
