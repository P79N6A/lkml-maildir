your point is well taken -- i wasn't trying to suggest that a blind
cut-and-replace would be appropriate, only that there were an awful
lot of places where it wasn't clear that that kind of replacement
*wasn't* appropriate.  or perhaps even recommended.  (doing that kind
of search in the drivers/ directory would perhaps be more meaningful
than in the arch/ directory.  just my luck i picked a bad example.)
clearly, that kind of replacement might require manual intervention in
a lot of cases, no question.  as with other examples i've brought up
here, i'm just looking at this from a relatively newbie perspective,
where i'm perusing the code and, in this case, got to thinking, "gee,
given that every architecture defines a clear_page() macro, i wonder
why all these people keep calling memset()."  that's all.
kind of like how, given that include/linux/gfp.h defines the macro
__get_dma_pages(), so many people persist in calling
__get_free_pages() with a GFP_DMA setting.  that sort of thing.  :-)
