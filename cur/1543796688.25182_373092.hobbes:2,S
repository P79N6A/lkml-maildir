You don't seem to grasp that thousands of people DO use these features, 
and by removing the features those users are blocked from security, 
reliability, and performance related changes. And there are a number of 
other features mentioned

To a large extent I don't think it's a needed task. If new stuff doesn't 
work that doesn't hurt established uses, it's only when changes like the 
PCI rethink go in that existing users are impacted. As long as things 
aren't taken OUT, the current kernel is usefully stable.
