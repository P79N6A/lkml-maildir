Definitely...  that is the sort of stuff that upstream folks never see 
when they rebase -- it causes an explosion of downstream rebasing, where 
each rebase must wait for the one-step-up upstream to rebase, before 
patches can be sent.  It's easy for the rebasing to get exponential 
quickly, the more downstream levels you have.
