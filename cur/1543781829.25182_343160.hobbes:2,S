OK, I found one simple solution. The problem stems from max_mutex being
grabbed.  Since this uses the RT locks, and since tracing shouldn't
really care about PI and all that, I switched this to a
compat_semaphore, but only if CONFIG_WAKEUP_TIMING is set. This seems to
get rid of this race condition that I have.
I found more bugs, but for now this message is about this specific race.
