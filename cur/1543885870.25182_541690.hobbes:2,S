Have you considered how such capabilities will be used in the future?
One of the important use cases I can see today is the ability to
split the heavily-overloaded e.g. CAP_SYS_ADMIN into much more fine
grained attributes.
What we definitely do NOT want to happen is an application that needs
priviledged access (e.g. e2fsck, mount) to stop running because the
new capabilities _would_ have been granted by the new kernel and are
not by the old kernel and STRICTXATTR is used.
To me it would seem that having extra capabilities on an old kernel
is relatively harmless if the old kernel doesn't know what they are.
It's like having a key to a door that you don't know where it is.
Cheers, Andreas
