I enabled the things that sounded useful.  I will try enabling the rest.

Yeah I did that.  No response to sysrq (at least not on the serial
console.  Maybe I should get a keyboard connector put on.)  Normally we
run without VGA/keyboard/etc, and just serial console.  Of course the
serial console requires working interrupts.  Not sure about the keyboard
driver.

Can I run that remotely somehow?  I never really looked at kdb or kgdb
before.

I don't know of a good version yet.  I so far don't know if there ever
was one.  This could even be a bug in the PCI hardware, or the way the
BIOS on this system on a board configured the PCI controller.  Maybe I
should go back and try a 2.4 kernel.

Well hopefully.
