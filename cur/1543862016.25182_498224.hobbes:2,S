Yes - you can see that from the vmstat output I sent.
At 500GB into the write of each file (about 60% of the disks filled)
the per fs write rate should be around 220MB/s, so aggregate should
be around 650MB/s. That's what Im seeing with 2.6.18 and 2.6.20-rc3
with a tweaked dirty_ratio. Without the dirty_ratio tweak, you see
what is in 2.6.20-rc3-worse.
e.g. I just changed dirty ratio from 10 to 40 and I've gone from
consistent 210-215MB/s per filesystm (~630-650MB/s aggregate) to
ranging over 110-200MB/s per fielsystem and aggregates of ~450-600MB/s.
I changed dirty_ratio back to 10, and within 15 seconds we are back
to consistent 210MB/s per filesystem and 630-650MB/s write.

Ok, I'll get back to you on that one - even at 600+MB/s, writing 5TB
of data takes some time....
Cheers,
Dave.
