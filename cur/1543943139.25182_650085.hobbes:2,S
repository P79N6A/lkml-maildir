Richard,
Would you accept the addition of brightness_get to the led class?  Please
look at the first patch in this small patch set series.  I need it for
thinkpad-acpi...
The other two patches to thinkpad-acpi are included for reference on how I
intend to useg the new brightness_get stuff, and also the hardware
acceleration for led flashing.  While the thinkpad-acpi patches do work, it
is unlikely to apply cleanly since it is from the tip of my thinkpad-acpi
development tree :) They are NOT to be merged right now, I will submit them
to Len Brown later, for 2.6.26.
