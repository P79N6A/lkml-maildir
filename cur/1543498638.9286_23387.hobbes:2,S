Hi,
   When i recieved different fragments of the same packet using Tcpdump, i
found that the time for all the fragments of a packet to arrive at my host
is always the same. This may not be the case when there is congestion or
what. Is it due to the kernal stack (IP stack which waits for all the
fragments to arrive before it sends to the user program??) or the timer
resolution or??? for tcpdump to show all the fragments arriving at the
same time?
 I would kindly appreciate if somebody could be able to provide me a
solution. Have a nice day then :)
Regards,
Victor
