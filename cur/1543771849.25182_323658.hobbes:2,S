Hello,
Where can I found new version of the libata-dev1 patches required for 
SMART on SATA? They used to be avaliable from 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/libata/
 but it seems 
it is no longer true. Or, is it possible to extract such patches 
somehow from the 
http://www.kernel.org/git?
Best regards,
