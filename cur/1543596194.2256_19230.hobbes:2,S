Subject: pte_val(*pte) as lvalue

In my driver, I have this code:
    unsigned long p = pte_val(*pte);
    [set some bits in "p"]
    pte_val(*pte) = p;
This works fine in 2.2, and 2.4 when PAE support is disabled.  When PAE support
is enabled, it doesn't work, because the pte_val macro can no longer be an
lvalue.
What is the accepted way to assign an integer to a pte that works in 2.2 and
2.4?
