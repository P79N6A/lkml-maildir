    USB: switch ehci-hcd to new polling scheme
    Switch ehci-hcd to use the new polling scheme, which reports root
    hub status changes via the interrupt handler, in an asynchronous
    fashion. Doing so disables polling for status changes (whose
    handler is
    rh_timer_func).
    Tested on a Geode GX machine, which is now capable of running at =~
5
    timer interrupts per second (in the -rt tree), resulting in
significant
    power savings.
