AFAIK, for your needs either:
- Use atomic ops
- Use per-cpu data with preempt disabling/irq disabling
- Use the original "real" spin locks/rwlocks (raw_*).
- Don't play with timers or wakeups, since this kernel code uses the
  "standard" spin locks (sleepable in -rt).
You just don't want to sleep in the tracing code.
Make sure that the sub-buffer switch code respects that too: it is the
most tricky and yet less executed part of the tracing code, so it's easy
for bugs to slip there and yet be undetected for a while.
Since you will likely disable preemption, make sure your tracing code
executes in a deterministic time.
