Sounds like exactly what we need.  If we standardise on something like
the above, we could just have a CONFIG_FRONT_PANEL_MONITOR and ask
people to send in the LED status with bug reports.

I'll buy some LEDs and build a parallel port connected LED panel
tomorrow...  Do you think the overhead of driving the LEDs would have
too much of a negative effect on system performance?  If so, or if we
want more flexibility, maybe we could work out a design for a PCI
card, which could include more than 12 LEDs - 7-segment numeric
displays of pid, etc.
John.
