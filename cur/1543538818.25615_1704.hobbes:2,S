Subject: [PATCH] to 2.4.0-test4-pre6, alpha, osf_select & KFDS_NR (poll.h breakage)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/7/13/87

Somebody ripped stuff out of poll.h and forgot to compile on an alpha.
osf_sys.c: In function `osf_select':
osf_sys.c:1079: `KFDS_NR' undeclared (first use in this function)
osf_sys.c:1079: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
osf_sys.c:1079: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [osf_sys.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_arch/alpha/kernel] Error 2
This patch restores - in a very hacky way - compilation of the kernel on the
alpha. Someone with a (much) greater understanding of poll.h should grep
their way through the kernel sources and have a go at fixing up the other
breakages.
