Greg,
I'm getting the following message from the kernel on an embedded ppc32  
system:
PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #9:100000@e0000000 for 0000:00:00.0
The HW setup is a PCIe host controller and an e1000 NIC card.  It  
appears that pci_bus_assign_resources() is trying to call  
pci_assign_resource() for the ROM and the resource for the ROM is  
[100000:1fffff] where the PHB is [c0000000:dfffffff].
It seems like the resno that pci_assign_resource is getting called  
with is wrong and thus pci_update_resource() doesn't get called.
any ideas?
