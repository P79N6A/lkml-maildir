You added a linear IP search to fast path ARP processing. The people running 
thousands of IP aliases will surely love you. You could at least use the
ip_route_input output instead that arp_rcv computes anyways and check
for RTN_LOCAL. 
BTW, the idea of doing it in user space is not to have a daemon running
but just to do DAD once when you configure the ip address, like most
other OSes do [as easily done with arping and a small script, see ipcfg
from iproute2]. 
Overall it looks like bloat.
