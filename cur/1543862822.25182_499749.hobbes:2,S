Subject: where to maintain userspace daemon for line discipline

The recent discussion on LKML convinced me that a line discipline
is the correct way to layer a driver over a serial interface.
This means, however, that I'll need a (trivial) userspace daemon
which will hold the serial interface open after pushing the line
discipline onto it.
Which raises the question: Where can I drop the source for that
daemon so that it is
a) maintained together with the line discipline in case a kernel
developer feels the need to change something and
b) picked up by distributions so that they don't end up shipping
the line discipline without the necessary daemon?
Is there an appropriate place in or near the kernel tree for
stuff like that?
Thanks
Tilman
