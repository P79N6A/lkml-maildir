That doesn't imply that statics are being exported as symbols. 
generic_serial had no EXPORT_xxx markers, and block_til_ready was
public, so it was expected behavior for g_s to export b_t_r as a symbol.
It is strange that a static which exists in riscom8 causes another
module which exports the same symbol to be pulled in.

Can this function be made static?  It looks like many drivers define it
themselves..
In any case, you have a patch coming to you [offline] cleaning up the sx
and riscom8 namespaces...
