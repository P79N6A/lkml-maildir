I think I can speak with some measure of confidence for at least the
OLTP-testing part of my company when I say that I have no objection to
Nick's planned merge scheme.
I believe the kernel benchmark group have also done some testing with
SLQB and have generally positive things to say about it (Yanmin added to
the gargantuan cc).
Did slabtop get fixed to work with SLQB?
