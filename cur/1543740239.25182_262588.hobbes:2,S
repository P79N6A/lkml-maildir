Hi,
ACPI is supposed to replace legacy PNPBIOS. The patches (I'll send them
follow this mail) introduce ACPI PNP layer and make ACPI work with
legacy devices better (such as avoid resources conflict between PNP
devices and PCI devices). With the patches, some ACPI drivers such as
8250_acpi, ACPI motherboard driver can be removed, since now we have a
unified interface for PNPBios and ACPI PNP. The patches are against
2.6.9 and tested at both IA32 and IA64. Please give your comments.
Thanks,
Shaohua
