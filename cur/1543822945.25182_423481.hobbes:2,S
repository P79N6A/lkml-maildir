Hi Len,
Each Processor has its own RAM and the main ARM9 processor can access
the ARM7 Memory Map through a _Shared RAM_.
In other words, the Memory Map of ARM7 processors is visible to ARM9 processor.
Finally there are 3 RAMs:
1) System RAM (ARM9)
2) Shared RAM (the Common Memory)
3) Local RAM for ARM7s.
Basically, this is a _flexible_ mechanism to control the _visibility_
of Each Processor.
And the Memory Controller can do either _cached_ or _non-cached_ operations.
Regards,
krs
