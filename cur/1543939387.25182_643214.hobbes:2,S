Subject: [PATCH 128/196] Kobject: the cris iop_fw_load.c code is broken
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/25/220

This code is really really really broken.  So much so that it's almost
impossible to fix with a simple patch, so just comment out the offending
registration with the kobject core, and mark the driver as broken.
The problem is that the code is trying to register a "raw" struct
device, which is not allowed.  struct device is only for use within the
driver model.  This is being done to try to use the firmware layer which
wants a struct device.  To properly fix this, use something easy, like a
platform device, which is a struct device and can be used for this kind
of thing.
