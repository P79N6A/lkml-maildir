Subject: x86-64 sporadic hang in  2.6.23rc7 and 2.6.22

The two kernels mentioned hangs occationally.
Typically when I compile something and pass the time
by surfing the web.
A few minutes and then I notice that the mouse (and everything else in X)
stops.  kbd LEDs does not react to numlock/capslock.
The only thing that still works is sysrq+B
So far this has happened while running X, so no messages.
I have gone back to 2.6.22rc4, which seems to work.
This is a single opteron, although on a dual-slot board.
