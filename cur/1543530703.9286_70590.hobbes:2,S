As those bugs are simply bugs that didn't show up because the driver
hadn't been run on SMP just yet, they should be fixed. 
By the end of the 2.4 lifetime, many more people will be running SMP
hardware than now. 
How about making "preemptive kernel" a "default-on" option on 2.4pre
and a "default-off" option on the real 2.4 kernel?
