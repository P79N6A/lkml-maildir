I have a related question.  While I am confident I can get RH9 to work
with a 2.5 kernel, I would like to do this in such a way that booting
into a 2.4 kernel still works, and installing updated 2.4 kernel RPMs
from Red Hat also continues to work.  I would also like to avoid making
any changes that prevent me from upgrading to the next RH release.  I
assume I can accomplish this by only making changes that involve installing
rpms rather than installing programs directly.  I am not confident I can 
accomplish all this, having failed in my attempt with RH8 :-)
Can anyone comment on the feasibility of this?
Thanks,
Jim
