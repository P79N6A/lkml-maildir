Hi Ingo,
I have and the lawyers tell me that it is one or the other and can not be
both.  So explain to me how a GPL/BSD or BSD/GPL works again?
Also if one does an md5sum on the "COPYING" file from FSF and compares it
from the one in the kernel source they differ.
Since the original version from FSF protects the content inside because it
protects the shell of the file, bridge point to stating the kernel is w/o
a license is relativily  easy.  I will have to re-read the "original
COPYING" file from FSF for version 1 and version 2.
Not sure but could the veil of GPL be now pierced because of the simple
additions to the top of "COPYING" ?
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
