Maybe to the contrary - an older one? :-)  Some ten years ago, or maybe
this was even earlier, when I was doing 'info' and 'makeinfo' port
to Atari ST the cursor keys worked and they still work in my copy
which came with Red Hat 5.2 distribution.  Not that I am using
'info' browser that often, mind you.  I had to fire it up to check. :-)
But an advantage of 'info' is that you **do not have to** use cursor
keys if you are not so inclined.
All right, all right - this has nothing to with kernel; even on Atari.
