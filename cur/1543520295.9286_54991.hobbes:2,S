Hi, 
Question for PCI gurus: Is: 
	void mybcopy( char *from, char *to, int amount)
	{
	  while ( amount-- )
	    *to++ = *from++;
	}
guaranteed to perform byte transactions on a PCI device? (The device
at hand doesn't support non-byte tranactions)
"to" is probably on the PCI device, while "from" is usually in main
memory, but might be cached closer to the CPU....
			Roger.
