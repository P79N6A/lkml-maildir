Good question. It's a Toshiba Tecra S1 with SD-card reader, 2 PCMCIA, 
DVD/CDRW drive, modem, ipw2200, ...
Maybe it's the card reader, never used it. That's why I attached
both dmesg outputs; thought you can find the info in there.

It's working as long pci=assign-busses is not used. (Can't tell for
sure for the card reader)
I'm having a problem with ipw2200 which is currently dealt with by the 
maintainers of this modules. If it has nothing to do with it just 
ignore this because I was just doing what the kernel told me to do ;-)
thanks,
Helmut
