My FC5 CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS=n box has no /dev/ptmx, /dev/pts/*, all of
/dev/tty0 through /dev/tty63 and no /dev/pty*.
I'm not sure where all the /dev/tty*'s came from - perhaps a static udev
rule?

well, /dev/tty is attached to your current tty and /dev/tty2 will get you
talking to the second VT.  I can't immediately thing what /dev/tty22 is
attached to.
