I considered it once, for about 30s - the answer was no. For one, Andrew 
moves way too fast for me to keep up with. For another, he has different 
objectives - he basically runs a testing tree, whereas I want to go for
something more stable, with cherry picked enhancements (mostly performance
and serviceability stuff).
There's a fair amount of common code between the two trees, which I try
to keep pretty much in sync between the two - I pick up changes he makes
from his latest trees, and send him changes I make.
