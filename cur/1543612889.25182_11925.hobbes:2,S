I don't think it matters if you do a 1:1 map or not, since the NUMA-Q boxes work 
fine without assuming this (I don't use physical APIC id's at all, except for from 
the I/O APIC to just broadcast), and I don't think anyone else does either after
we boostrap.
It shouldn't be all that hard to check. Mentally mark every time we look at the 
physical APIC id, and which variables are set from that and thus "tainted". I
did this once - I don't think it's very many at all.
I don't think changing the order we look at phys_cpu_present_map should
make much of a difference.
On the other hand, relying on the "arbitrary" cpu numbers either way doesn't
seem like the best of ideas ;-)
Martin.
