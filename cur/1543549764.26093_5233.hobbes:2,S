Not sure if I have the whole context (I've not yet received Ingo's email
that you're replying to).
Currently we do a memory balancing pass indipendently by the order of the
allocation. Thus we don't do any iteraction and the memory balancing
is completly order blind (unfortunately it's also zone blind, while
at least in 2.2.x the memory balancing known which zone it had
to allocate memory from).
If Ingo suggested more iteractions of memory balancing for those cases
that should only make things better with respect to fragmentation.
But I'd much prefer to pass not only the classzone from allocator
to memory balancing, but _also_ the order of the allocation,
and then shrink_mmap will know it doesn't worth to free anything 
that isn't contigous on the order of the allocation that we need.
classzone haven't reached this point yet.
