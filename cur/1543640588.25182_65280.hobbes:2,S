OK. hdc=flash works where hdc=hard drive and hdd=CompactFlash.
Thanks Padraig.
I guess it's 6 of one, half-dozen the other, but telling the kernel that my
hard drive is a flash drive just makes me feel squidgy!  I'm still inclined
to suggest that the test that _prevents_ hard drive + CF configuration is no
longer appropriate now that _some_ (most??) hardware vendors have figured
out how to get ide-flash devices to work without "hanging" when no second
device is present. Users with incompatible hardware can still prevent the
long system hang by using hdx=none.
I also used this workaround (hdb=flash) to configure a system with hda=flash
and hdb=cdrom.  This seems to work also.  Are there any side effects to
telling the kernel that the hard drive or cdrom is a flash device (such as
marking it removable or not marking it removable)?
