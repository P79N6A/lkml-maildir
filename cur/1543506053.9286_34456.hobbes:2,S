The PCI bus is non cache coherent on some ARM boxes.

What I am after here is that on some busses, like SBUS, you need to do
certain setups before doing DMA's etc. The issue here is that you
could in principle have a two different buses in a machine, for
instance one which is sparse and one which is not.

Oh yes cache coherency matters very much here if you want the drivers
to work on the ARM boxes.
