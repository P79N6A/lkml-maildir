Hmm, but there is no way for the chipset to tell us that this 
is needed. 
Perhaps we really need to special case this and add posted pci config
writes to handle Michael's power management issue properly. 
That would be definitely the safer approach.

Problem is that it adds silently a very subtle bug and there
is no way I know of for ACPI to tell the firmware it shouldn't use
posting. The driver should know when the read is forbidden though.
