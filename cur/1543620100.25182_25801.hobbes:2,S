Almost. IIUC, there is still the possibility that a timer queued
in one CPU may get executed in another. While this by itself
doesn't cause a problem for this RCU implementation (we end up
checking some other CPU's queue), if one CPU is starved of timers,
it could be problematic.
Since we have many per-cpu data structures, it would be a useful thing
to have a per-cpu mechanism to manipulate these data structures
in a cache-sensitive way.

IIRC, timerlist_lock used to show up in lockmetering in some workloads
we were using some time ago. It would be a good thing to get rid
of this global lock soon.
