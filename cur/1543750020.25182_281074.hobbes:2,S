The problem with unit-at-a-time isn't compiler availability,
but the fact that at least with gcc-3.4 on x86 it causes
significant stack usage increases, which in the kernel lead
to stack overflow problems. This is not a theoretical issue,
the overflows have been observed in normal kernels.
So wrt inlining failures, the correct fix is to remove the
inlines or rearrange the code to allow inlining w/o unit-at-a-time.
