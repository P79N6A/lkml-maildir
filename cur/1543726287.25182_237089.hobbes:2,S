I have also found that if I stress the VM subsystem severely using
sysbench --threads=128 --test=memory, jackd will not start, eventually
its watchdog thread will kill it before it opens the audio ports.  It
seems likely that under pressure the mlockall() would never return.  I
can add some debugging code to jackd if you need to see which system
call is timing out.
