Actually,  even though I  agree that  Richard is  overdramatizing, his
point is  not completely  invalid.  Remembering the  trusted computing
initiative,  it's always  a question  of who  holds the  keys  to your
computer.   In our  case it's  no problem,  since we  compile  all the
software on the computer ourselves, and thus we have full control over
what we do.
What trusted computing revealed is that there is at least amongst some
companies  a desire  to be  able to  dictate what's  going on  on your
computer. Think Disney here.
Sure, TCPA is dead.  But I've seen a TPM chip. On an Intel test board.
IBM has  them as well.  I agree  that we can trust  all these entities
now. But what's going to happen ten years from now? We don't know.
I'm not  proclaiming paranoia. I don't  say we should  burn this patch
alive. I only say  that from time to time we have  to take care of not
getting to the Wernher von Braun excuse.

PS. I did a module signing patch  some years ago. I did a framework. I
    did tests. I got scared of its power. All I say is, take care.
