Hi,
actually.. not really; the __round_jiffies_relative function just takes
a CPU number, and internally takes care of spreading things around based
on CPU number (eg it does the *3 internally); it's cleaner that way, the
callers don't need to bother by how much to spread for each cpu etc
etc... So the patch is correct as is.
