You haven't symlinked /etc/mtab to /proc/mounts.
I always do it. Kernel knows better what is mounted, and where.
(at least supposed to know. You are right, currently /proc/mtab
is a bit not ok regarding bind mounts).
/etc/mtab is a historic userspace
hack for ancient Unix systems where kernel had no way to export
that info.
