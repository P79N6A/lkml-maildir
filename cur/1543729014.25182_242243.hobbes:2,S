hm, it seems the mlockall() issue is too deterministic for it to be a
statistical-only phenomenon. Also, isnt that xrun on the order of 15
msecs? That's way too big too.

there should be no relation between softirqs and mlockall().
this is truly a mind-boggling latency. mlockall() is fully preemptible. 
All it does is to pre-fault the whole range of pages that a process has.
could you try another thing: modify mlockall-test.cc to use mlock() on
the freshly allocated anonymous pages? Does this produce the same
latencies? mlockall() prefaults _all_ pages the process currently has. 
Maybe mlockall() touches some page that is mapped both by jackd and
mlockall-test and thus somehow interacts with jackd's scheduling.
the anonymous pages themselves can have no IPC-alike connection to any
page jackd owns. It is unlikely for that to be any connection between
jackd and mlockall-test - other than both map glibc. To further exclude
any possibility of resource sharing between jackd and mlockall-test,
could you compile the later with -static?
