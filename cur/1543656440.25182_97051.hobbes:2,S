In fact, I agree with Andrew.  But Pavel insist and want it,
and since it is really straightforward to have it in 2.5
because Pavel have already done all the work, why not giving
him a little gift for Christmas ?
A final word:  S4bios is way much _slower_ by nature than S4OS, especially
at suspend path, which is what we don't want if we have to go to S4 due
to an emergency.
Kai, if you see that S4OS is slower, it is probably a bug that have to be
fixed in swsusp.
