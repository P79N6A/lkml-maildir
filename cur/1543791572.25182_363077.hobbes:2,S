The whole thing is pretty easy. The interrupt code just signals
a task to do whatever...
For example:
Interrupt service routine or anything else, sets the
value in 'what' and 'which'. It then executes
(in demo code)  wake_up_interruptible(info->twait);
... and coutinues whatever it was doing. The daemon wakes
up (whenever) and, in process-context does whatever was
you wanted it to do.
extern void turn_led_on(int led);  // Can sleep
extern void turn_len_off(int len); // Can sleep
enum WHAT {
    TURN_LED_ON,
    TURN_LED_OFF,
    FLASH_LED,
    STOP_FLASH };
static WHAT what;
static int which;
static int local_kernel_thread(void *unused) {
     daemonize(name);
     for(;;) {
         set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
         if(signal_pending(current))
             complete_and_exit(&info->quit, 0);
         interruptible_sleep_on(&info->twait);
         set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
         preempt_disable();   // So we get this done soon
         switch(what) {
         case TURN_LED_ON:
             turn_led_on(which);
             break;
        case TURN_LEN_OFF:
             turn_led_off(which);
             break;
        case FLASH_LED:
            start_timer_queue_for_flashing_led(which); // Can sleep
            break;
        case STOP_FLASH:
            stop_timer_queue_for_flashing_led(which); // Can sleep
            break;
        default:
            printk("Brain fart\n");
        }
        preempt_enable();
     }
     return 0;
}
You never want to busy-wait for some "bells and whistles". You
just make a bells-and-whistles kernel daemon that does whatever
you want.
