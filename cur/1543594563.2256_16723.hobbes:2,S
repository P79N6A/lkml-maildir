What a co-incidence. I just hit this problem a few days ago.
The problem here is that:
1.	the dma buffer drains to zero.
2.	interrupt handler set LVI to CIV.
3.	app write more than a buffer size of data to dma buffer.
4.	LVI is un-changed!
There's a kludgey work-around I used, (never use more than
31 segments of the DMA buffer). (I.e. never use the last
dmabuf->fragsize of the dma buffer). This cures the hang
but it isn't an optimal solutions.

A better fix _may_ be to set CIV to LVI instead of the other way
around. (This assumes CIV is writeable). No testing at all;
may not be a fix. 
Something like:
