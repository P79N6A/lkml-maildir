Hi,
2.3.15 seems having some problems that may either be related to ax25 or
soundmodem driver.
First of all a listen -t -c -a gives me some errormessages.
Secondly connecting and disconnecting works fine but the ax25 seems
refusing to send any other packets. (dama-slave is disabled but
behaviour is somewhat like if
it would be enabled)
Maybe someone has experienced similiar problems.
In 2.3.14 everything worked fine.
cu,
David
