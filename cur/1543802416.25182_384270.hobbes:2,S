And this is exactly what you predicted for one of the merged stacks.

The decision was already in the past - there is one stack that is 
already merged.
The question is whether there is a different stack that is considered 
that much better that switching to this stack including converting all 
drivers is worth the effort.
In the short term, having different stacks with different features and 
deficites only creates confusion.
In the long term, different stacks in the kernel will be a maintenance 
nightmare.
