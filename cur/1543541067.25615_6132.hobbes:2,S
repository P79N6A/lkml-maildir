You would need a master key. Still better than no random numbers on a
diskless server.

One bit ? I was assuming you always put in in the time difference between
interrupts, which is surely a lot more than one bit (when it is there or not)
Alternatively you could just run a Stream cipher over the input, but I guess
that requires too much trust for the outgoing hash (just like the prng)
