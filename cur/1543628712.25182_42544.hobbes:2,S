hi *
I have a BT930 controller; works fine for all scsi disks I have ..
except one..
there is one disk that for the second time has killed the system.
First time I was not at the system when it happened. This time I was.
I heard the following sound (yep, technical ahum) :
click
downspin....
click
upspin......
it was maybe only 3 seconds. but the system froze completely; numlock
leds etc were ok, but magic sysrq didn't work (??)
also, no way I could remotely log onto the system anymore.
At this point, as it's a datadisk, I have taken it off the scsi bus to
prevent further bad things to happen.
unfortunately, there was nothing regarding the scsi controller or disk
in the log.
any ideas what I could do to help preventing this ? (seems somewhere a
bug in the kernel/bt930 ?)
Roeland
