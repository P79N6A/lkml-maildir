I worked there early on as a consultant and from what I remember of what
they are doing, I doubt very much that they did anything special to make
this happen.  The somewhat inaccurate description of how this happens is
that there are more pages, with all those words on them, which point to
the offensive page, than any other group of pages pointing to some other
page.
None the less, highly, highly amusing.
