First, I am not subscribed to this list so please reply to me directly
if you wish a timely response to any questions. In any case, I will lurk
in the archives for responses.
I am using atomic_t to count interrupts from some piece of hardware.
These interrupts come at a fairly high rate -- 10 KHz and higher. The
problem is, will I get increment problem at the limit of atomic_t or
will it wrap around without error? I read the docs (man pages, on-line
api docs, this list and other stuff) and none of them talk about the
behavior of atomic_t at the boundaries. Furthermore, am I guaranteed of
any boundary behavior across platforms?
Thank you in advance for any and all help.
