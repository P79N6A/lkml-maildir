On IRIX and UNICOS (haven't hunted up Solaris yet):
   1. UNICOS Resource quota says your job can have X memory.
   2. IRIX adds you can have H amount of heap memory, S amount of stack
	memory.
Both allow for overcommitting memory.
   UNICOS hangs with processes in the swap state, and one process that
	can run.
   IRIX does the random process abort.
Both can be controled, I have run IRIX without overcommit, and UNICOS has
been run without overcommit.
