It is a failure condition for setup_proc_entry() but you're saying that
shouldn't cause a failure of _init_airo_card() as the driver would be
working fine even without procfs support, right?
Note that previously the no-procfs case was *really* broken (it would
explode right away in setup_proc_entry) and I'm not sure it can function
correctly without it now but I guess it's worth a try.
Which one would be preferred:
 a) make the setup_proc_entry() call in _init_airo_card() conditional on
CONFIG_PROC_FS
 b) simply ignore the result
