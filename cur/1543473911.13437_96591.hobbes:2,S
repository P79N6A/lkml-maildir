Hello:
Recently i installed slackware 3.5. So i want to work with 2.2.0pre3 kernel, alias development, guess. But if i want work with kernel 2.2.0 i need glibc2, that slackware don't come with it, glibc1 or libc5.
So i download glibc-2.0.6, linuxthreads, crypt and localedata. I was compile it, and everything ok! I install and ok!.
The steps that i was follow after to compiled (Glibc2 howto, install as the primary C library):
1) mkdir /usr/i486-linuxlibc5
2) mkdir /usr/i486-linuxlibc5/lib
3) mv /usr/include /usr/i486-linuxlibc5
4) mkdir /usr/include
   4.1) ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/linux /usr/include/linux  
   4.2) ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/asm /usr/include/asm
   4.3) ln -s /usr/X11R6/include/X11 /usr/include/X11
   4.4) ln -s /usr/lib/g++-include /usr/include/g++
   4.5) ln -s /usr/i486-linuxlibc5/include/ncurses /usr/include/ncurses
5) Add my new directory /usr/i486-linuxlibc5/lib at /etc/ld.so.conf
6) moved libbsd.a, libc.a, libgmon.a, libm.a, libmcheck.a, libc.so, libm.so from /usr/lib at /usr/i486-linuxlibc5/lib
7) copied libm.so.5.*, and libc.so.5.* from /lib at /usr/i486-linuxlibc5/lib
8) moved crt1.o, crti.0,crtn.o, and gcrt1.o from /usr/lib at /usr/i486-linuxlibc5/lib 
9) ldconfig -v
10) Now i was install glibc:
	10.1) make install
	10.2) ldconfig -v
11) I updated specs from my system by specs' file that come with Glibc2-HOWTO.
12) Tested my installation and everything ok!
13) Now i want to compile kernel 2.2.0, :)? But see the mistake that i got in attchmnt file when i compile with make zImage.
Can someone help me? Many thanks in advanced.
So long.
