ioctl() calls are for userspace only.
It just so happens there is an ioctl() call that provides an URB like
interface and an ioctl() call that provides a synchronous call to do
a control message.

I think you're looking at this incorrectly. You use the kernel API for
kernel modules. You can use either the ioctl() API or libusb for
userspace applications.
