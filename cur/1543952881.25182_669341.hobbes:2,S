It certainly doesn't work at all without it.  It is definetly not 
managing to figure out that the generated interupt is for itself.

This looks like it should accomplish the same thing (assuming not bits 
get set in status on the initial attempt to read it), without affecting 
other platforms and possible the alpha if anyone has a card that just 
works for whatever reason.  A better patch all around.  : )
