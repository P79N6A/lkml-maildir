More like receiving a guarantee of consensus (just like any signature on 
data), while only needing to be able to communicate with a single node.

Is there a URL?  Yes.  
http://linux.yyz.us/projects/cld.html
It it useful?  No.  It's just a skeleton code right now.  I am 
experimenting with various Paxos algorithms as we speak, which is why 
it's fresh in my mind at the moment.
I also forgot to mention hyperspace, which is another up-and-coming 
player in this area, alongside Chubby and zookeeper.
