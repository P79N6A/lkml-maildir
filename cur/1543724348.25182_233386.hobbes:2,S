Hi folks!
I've had a problem with mount -o bind
Environment (production server): 
Distro is Debian woody .
ii  mount          2.11n-7        Tools for mounting and manipulating
filesyst
Kernel compiled from vanilla sources.
Linux gremo1 2.4.25-lck1 #1 SMP Wed Apr 21 11:19:27 UTC 2004 i686
unknown
(it also has grsec compiled in but it was disabled)
15:22:21 up 37 days,  1:29,  1 user,  load average: 0.06, 0.04, 0.00
model name      : Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 2.40GHz
stepping        : 9
cpu MHz         : 2385.920
cache size      : 512 KB
I have mounted several directories with option -o bind in order to have
some files avalaible in a chroot.
Mount -o bind /dir1 /dir2
Yesterday I noticed that modifying some files in /dir1 didn't cause the
corresponding files in /dir2 to be modified.
It happened only for one mountpoint, not for the otner similar
mountpoints.
Umount && mount solved the problem.
The only strange thing is that some hours before i noticed this
behaviour, machine load reached 150 (apache was overloaded)
Is it a bug somewhere in the kernel ?
(kernel config is attached)
