Are you speaking for yourself, or for Red Hat as well?
Just for grins, I took a look at 
http://www.redhat.com/about/careers/
 to 
see what your company was offering for work.  Hey, no TCP/IP Stack 
programming jobs there.  In fact, very little in the way of work for 
back-room types at all in the United States, nothing west of the Rockies, 
and only Australia seems to have anything when you get outside of the CONUS.
There are some people desperate enough to receive money for their efforts 
that such job announcements may well be welcome, at least as long as they 
are real positions. Obviously you are not that hungry.  I'm working right 
now in a system admin position, changing the oil and wiping the windshield 
of 200 Red Hat Linux servers, in a position that does not allow for any 
kernel development at all.  What makes you believe that all 30,000+ readers 
of LKML would not welcome short, tasteful, single-shot announcements of 
such development positions?  Particularly if the announcement was for work 
within moving distance of where a reader lives?
(I suspect the poor guy was inundated with resumes, good taste or 
no.  That's what seems to happen when a company makes any kind of public 
announcement for work in California or Nevada.  Sometimes principles give 
way to other necessities.)
As an aside, I'm not happy with the few Linux-specific job boards that are 
out there.  Has Red Hat considered hosting one that works, and advertising 
its existence?
