Hello
I have a PCI machine with 2.4.25 kernel with 4 network cards:
eth0, IRQ 11, 3Com Corporation 3c900 Combo [Boomerang] (rev 0)
eth1, IRQ 5, 3Com Corporation 3c905C-TX/TX-M [Tornado] (rev 116).
eth2, IRQ 10, nVidia Corporation nForce2 Ethernet Controller (rev 161)
eth3, IRQ 3, Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 16)
Will the sequence of network cards change when I upgrade to 2.6.13.4?
All the drivers are compiled directly into kernel, not as modules.
Is the algorithm for assignment of eth? numbers by Linux kernel
documented anywhere?
