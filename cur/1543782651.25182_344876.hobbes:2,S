Ahhh! Thanks.

Ok, a shared writable mapping is made shmfs-based, so nopage is used there. A 
bit tricky to notice.

get_user_pages() can still get two faults there, because VM_FAULT_WRITE is not 
returned by do_swap_page(). And faults can be very expensive (for UML a fault 
is given by a SIGSEGV delivery).

The idea in my mind is that after loading the page from swap the first time 
there's no need to copy the page to give a private copy to the process, if 
the page is kept on swap.
We COW it anyway to break the sharing, to keep the original copy in the 
swapcache, instead of reading it again from the disk. This is *early*.

Removing pte_mkold() and leaving the _PAGE_ACCESSED in vma->vm_page_prot would 
just turn out in one call to mark_page_accessed() I guess,, i.e. from 
inactive, unreferenced to inactive, referenced, while activate_page makes two 
steps...

swapoff() and swapon() are not a real workload, agreed. But taking twice the 
spinlocks is bad, no?

Sorry for that and thanks for the insights!
