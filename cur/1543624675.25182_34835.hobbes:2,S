Yes, it would. 
It would be a bit more overhead for taking the address than a 
this_cpu_address(), because one would need to fetch the CPU number first
and do the arithmetic and the array reference instead of fetching the 
address directly. But I agree that per_cpu() has much cleaner semantics than
this_cpu_address() for addresses, so it is worth it.
When one considers preemptive kernels where you can lose your CPU anytime
then it makes even more sense. But then this_cpu is only safe there when
you turn off preemption or hold some lock or run in interrupt context.
Outside such regions per_cpu() seems to be safer. 
Thanks,
