Hi everybody,
I'm going to port JFFS2's compression modules to CryptoApi except  
{in|de}flate, which Artem is working(?) on.
I've noticed that the pcompress thing (slen <-> *slen and partial  
compression which about a discussion was on the list) is in Herbert's  
repository. Does it mean that it will get into the kernel once? I just  
would like to be sure whether should I implement pcompress or not.
The second thing is that we would like to use CryptoApi from user  
space. This way it won't be necessary to reimplement compression  
algorithms in user space filesystem image creation programs  
(mkfs.jffsx), and it would make using & distributing closed-source  
proprietary compression methods easier.
There's a patch at 
http://www.logix.cz/michal/devel/cryptodev/,
 written  
by Michal Ludvig, which adds a /dev/crypto device for this purpose, as  
on *BSD. Is there a chance that this can get into the kernel?
Regards,
   Patrik Kluba
