Sorry for the late replay I missed this patch series going by the first time.

Please, Please kill this.
As far as I can tell virtual mode is incompatible with kexec.
It is unnecessary because none of the EFI calls are fast path.
Further I believe that using virtual addresses is likely to
make things more brittle.
So please drop the EFI virtual mode nonsense.
Thank you,
Eric
