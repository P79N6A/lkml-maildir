Keep in mind that you _can_ staticly link even closed source
stuff against an LGPL library...  You just need to "Accompany the
work with a written offer, valid for at least three years" to
provide users with an object file that can be re-linked against
newer versions of the LGPL library.  Or simply provide the .o
file.  See the LGPL Section 6...

As far as I know, uClibc is the only library that is able to
replace glibc for real world linux distributions...  And I've
looked long and hard (which was why I ended up making uClibc),
