Well there you have it: they didn't recognise the second board at all. The dmesg should show it, but does not.
Please try attached patch to mxser.c. I cannot test, I have no two cards (in fact I haven't a single one either ;-). If it works out tell me and send patch to support@moxa.com.tw with regards from me :-)
Have fun,
Stephan
