I dont think it is true. The definition of TASK_PREEMPTS_CURR() is
unchanged with these patches. Also group priority is linked to the
highest priority task it has. As a result, the high-priority group-a
task should preempt the low priority group-b task.
This is unless group-a has currently run out of its bandwidth and is sitting in 
the expired queue (which is something that the TASK_PREEMPTS_CURR()
can be optimized to check for).
