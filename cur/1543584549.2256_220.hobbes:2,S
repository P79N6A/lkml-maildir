awww..  Don't say that.  Ludovic is a nice guy.
Look.  Suppose you have a SCHED_IDLE task which does this,
in the kernel:
down(&sem1);
down(&sem2);		/* This sleeps */
Now, a SCHED_OTHER task does this, in user space:
	for ( ; ; )
		;
We're dead.  The SCHED_IDLE task will never be scheduled,
and hence will never release sem1.  The solution to this
problem is well known but, as Ludovic says, "not simple".
