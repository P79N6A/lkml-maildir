See 
http://lwn.net/Articles/14633/
 and 
http://lwn.net/Articles/14446/
for Orlov.
I am not aware of serious benchmark work. Simple direct tests
seem either to show no significant difference or to favor Orlov.
I have never seen a study on fragmentation after extended use
of both allocators.
Concerning nobh, I think that is a toy by Andrew, meant for
very large machines. He is in a better position to comment
(in fact on both orlov and nobh).
