Thanks for looking at this.

Yes, I'm aware of this.  Before we enable FS_SAFE for block
filesystems, this must be addressed.
But I'm not sure _if_ we'll ever want this.  It is very likely that
there are some other security holes in most filesystems that are
difficult to address.  One example is checking for hard-linked
directories, which is normally only done during an fsck.

Right.
There are patches for enabling per-mount read-only, but this shows
well, that unprivileged block device mounts are far from trivial.
