Hi,
I and ran into following BUG() while doing RAW IO (2.5.3-pre6).
	 kernel BUG at ll_rw_blk.c:1336
Actual code is:
	BUG_ON(bio_sectors(bio) > q->max_sectors);
I am doing 64k IOs on QLOGIC SCSI controller/disks.
So
	bio_sectors(bio) is 128
	q->max_sectors is 64
Is this a QLOGIC driver bug ? I changed qlogicisp.c and set
host->max_sectors to 128. Now RAW IO seem to work fine. But
I get system hangs and filesystem gets corrupted. Any idea
on how to fix it ?
Thanks,
Badari
