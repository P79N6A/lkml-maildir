If you're thinking of replacing bus_to_virt/virt_to_bus, you might want
to think about virt_to_dma(dev, virt) and dma_to_virt(dev, dma) as a
replacement, where "dev" is the device actually performing the DMA
(which obviously may not be the device asking for the mapping to be set
up.)  ARM already has these for use in the architecture code.
