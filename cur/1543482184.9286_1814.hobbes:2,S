I don't think it was a good idea to stick the new PS/2 mouse detection code
in right before the big ole release. It still doesn't find my PS/2 mouse port
on the DEC UDB.. right now I've got a dirty hack in place to make sure it sees
it.
The /proc changes to avoid race conditions and such seem to have caused more
harm than good also. While I haven't bumped into a trouble with them, the
list traffic seems to point to it as a problem.
Well, those are my $0.02 worth and now I can sleep without a guilty conscience
;-)
