Fair enough: and I'm expecting this to be a regression we introduced in
2.6.15, rather than recently in 2.6.22 (now, that's better isn't it ;-?)
Helpful bad page state messages from your original post:

And very helpful info from your followup:

I think sound/isa/es18xx.c's
	snd_pcm_lib_preallocate_pages_for_all(pcm, SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV,
will take it to sound/core/memalloc.c's
	res = dma_alloc_coherent(dev, PAGE_SIZE << pg, dma, gfp_flags);
where we've carefully included __GFP_COMP in gfp_flags to avoid this
kind of problem (replacing the pre-2.6.15 use of PageReserved).

No, don't blame ALSA for this.  Blame me or Nick for removing the
special PageReserved usage, or Alpha for ignoring our gfp_flags:
  #define dma_alloc_coherent(dev, size, addr, gfp)	\
		pci_alloc_consistent(alpha_gendev_to_pci(dev), size, addr)
When you get a chance, please would you try patch below?  It's not ideal:
trying to satisfy a high-order allocation with GFP_ATOMIC is difficult
once you get beyond system startup, but apparently that part worked for
you before; and I don't think it'll do any harm - there were reasons
we couldn't just add __GFP_COMP behaviour everywhere, but I don't
think those could apply to the Alpha pci_alloc_consistent.
It would be a lot better if an Alpha (CONFIG_PCI=y) dma_alloc_coherent
were written to respect the dma flags passed in (masking off __GFP_DMA
and __GFP_HIGHMEM? other arches seem to do that).  And I wonder if its
pci_alloc_consistent couldn't use GFP_KERNEL rather than GFP_ATOMIC,
other arches seem to manage that.  But I've no Alpha nor Alpha
experience, I wouldn't dare to offer more than this one-liner.
Thanks for reporting: please let us all know whether this
patch does fix your problem: I may be guessing wrong.
