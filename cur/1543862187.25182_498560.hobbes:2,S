Subject: Ext3 mounted as ext2 but journal still in effect.

I have an ext3 filesystem that has been having problems
with its journal. The result is that the file system
remounts internally as read-only and the server becomes
unusable, even shutdown does not work, using up 100% of
the CPU but not rebooting.
I found some postings indicating that mounting it as
ext2 should fix the problem, as it doesn't appear to be
a hardware issue.
So, I decided to mount everything as ext2. Mount shows this:
# mount
/dev/hda2 on / type ext2 (rw,usrquota)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
none on /sys type sysfs (rw)
none on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
/dev/hda1 on /boot type ext2 (rw)
none on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,noexec)
none on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc (rw)
sunrpc on /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs type rpc_pipefs (rw)
But now I still get the error:
# dmesg
[...]
EXT3-fs error (device hda2) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
EXT3-fs error (device hda2) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
EXT3-fs error (device hda2) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
EXT3-fs error (device hda2) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
[...]
The kernel is:
# uname -a
Linux hyperweb.net 2.6.5-1.358smp #1 SMP Sat May 8 09:25:36 EDT 2004
i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Alberto
