Hi.
I discovered that the new kernels now always load the psaux driver
whether there is a mouse present or not when psaux is turned on.  This
caused the auto mouse configuration boot scripts I had written to
break when I upgraded from the 2.0.36 kernel.  Also, when the device
gets accessed and there is no PS/2 mouse present, the keyboard locks
up.
I saw some comments in the kernel mailing list archives that this was
apparently done because some people wanted to be able to hot plug a
PS/2 mouse in without rebooting.  The problem is, now there is no way
to auto configure the mouse from boot up init scripts.
Attatched below is a patch I created that allows one to choose in the
kernel configuration whether to require the PS/2 mouse to be present
to load the psaux driver.  I am in hopes this will be put in the
official kernels.  The patch was done against version 2.2.12.
Thanks.
Vincent
