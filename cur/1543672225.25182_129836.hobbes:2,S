Did all that, kernel didn't see the partition.

This didn't work, because /dev/md0p1 doesn't exists.

It could be.

My linux is:
Linux version 2.4.20 (root@localhost) (gcc version 3.2.2)
kernel config related to raid:
#
# Multi-device support (RAID and LVM)
#
CONFIG_MD=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD=m
CONFIG_MD_LINEAR=m
CONFIG_MD_RAID0=m
CONFIG_MD_RAID1=m
CONFIG_MD_RAID5=m
CONFIG_MD_MULTIPATH=m
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LVM is not set
My raidtab is:
       raiddev /dev/md0
           raid-level              5
           nr-raid-disks           3
           nr-spare-disks          0
           persistent-superblock   1
           chunk-size              32
           parity-algorithm        left-symmetric
           device                  /dev/hdc
           raid-disk               0
           device                  /dev/hde
           raid-disk               1
           device                  /dev/hdg
           raid-disk               2
any idea?
