Because I can't find any documentation for cgroups? :)

This comes no where close to AppArmor's functionality:
    * Can't do learning mode
    * Can't do wildcards
    * Sucks up huge loads of memory to do that much FS mounting (imagine
      thousands of bind mounts)
    * I'm not sure, but I don't think you can do file granularity, only
      directories

Containers and access controls provide related but different functions.
Stop trying to force containers to be an access control system, it does
not fit well at all.
Rather, we need to ensure that LSM and containers play well together.
What you proposed in the past was to have an LSM module per container,
but I find that absurdly complex: if you want that, then use a real VMM
like Xen or something. Containers are mostly used for massive virtual
domain hosting, and what you want there is as much sharing as possible
while maintaining isolation. so why would you corrupt that with separate
LSM modules per container?
What makes sense to me is to ensure that it is easy for an LSM module to
have a policy per container. This is relatively easy to do, and maps
very well to the primary use of containers for hosting virtual domains.
