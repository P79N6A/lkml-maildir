I am using the IDE patch. I've heard that the A7V133 which is based on the
KT133A chipset works much better in linux. I know people using it in a
router for a 1000 client network on a 100Mbit connection and it's working
fine, no problems at all. If we push the networking too hard we get a lot
of spurious interrupts and it appears as we loose some interrupts aswell
as NIC drivers and IDE drivers start complaining sometimes and when it has
started loosing interrupts only a reboot can bring it back to
"normal" operation.

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
