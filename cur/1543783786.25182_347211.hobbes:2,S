Subject: [DVB patch 22/54] frontend: or51132: remove bogus optimization attempt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Mac Michaels <wmichaels1@earthlink.net>
This fix has also been applied to lgdt330x. There is
an optimization that keeps track of the frequency tuned by
the digital decoder. The digital driver does not set the
frequency if it has not changed since it was tuned. The
analog tuner driver knows nothing about the frequency saved
by the digital driver. When the frequency is set using the
video4linux code with tvtime, the hardware get changed but
the digital driver's state does not get updated. Switch
back to the same digital channel and the driver finds no
change in frequency so the tuner is not reset to the
digital frequency. The work around is to remove the check
and always set the tuner to the specified frequency.
