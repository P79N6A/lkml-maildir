hello everybody,
when i do a ksyms -a | grep skb_dump  (this symbol i
have added )
 i see 
some_addr  __VERSIONED_SYMBOL(skb_dump)
I think this is the reason it gives unresolved symbol
when I try to load a module that calls the function
>From a reply by Keith to a mail on the list earlier I
gather that this is coaused because the dev.c where
this symbol is  defined is implicitly included via
obj-$(CONFIG_NET) += dev.o dev_mcast.o 
There was no followup on what needs to be done  on
that thread .
I guess the sender was an intelligent person   :(
Can Somebody please tell me  what I need to do to
resolve this. I am trying to export a  few other
symbols but  they do not even get added to /proc/ksyms
please advise 
Regards,
amit
