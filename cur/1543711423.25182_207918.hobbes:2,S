BTW, speaking of identify-device, hdparm -i (which uses
HDIO_GET_IDENTITY) always returns "WriteCache=enabled" while hdparm -I
that uses HDIO_DRIVE_CMD with WIN_PIDENTIFY reports the "correct" state
that I've previously set with -W0. This is an i386 machine w/ 2.6.5-rc1.
Is HDIO_GET_IDENTITY working correctly?
