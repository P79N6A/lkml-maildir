actually, I have an algorithm to fix that.  (had to implement this on a system
with a single 32 bit decrementer (an ADI21060 SHARC, YUK!))  the algorithm
simulates a free spinning 64 bit incrementer given  a 32 bit interrupting
decrementer under exclusive control of the timekeeping code.  it also takes
into account the read/calculate/write interval.
