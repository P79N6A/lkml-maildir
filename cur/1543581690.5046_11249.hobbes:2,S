All,
I just compiled 2.4.1-ac10 with the loop-3 patch from adoeb and it seems to fix
the loopback problems.	This is for someone NOT using the encrypted FS since I
did not test this.
If anyone has a better way to make sure everything is working correctly other
than using mkinitrd to test if the loopback works then please let me know.
Thanks for the fix,
Sean
