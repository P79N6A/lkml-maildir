This is a false assumption IMO no binary only modules can be "good".

What you've just described are the most evil binary only modules. :-)
Please think a while about all these recent "the most famous binary module"
vs 4kb kernel stacks mails...
I think that binary modules are evil because:
- they slow down development (indirectly - think about it)
- some vendors claim Linux support
  while they only provide binary only modules
- less informed users tend to put blame on kernel or distribution
  not the binary only module (!)
I'm not a fanatic :-), I can see good sides of binary only modules:
- additional hardware and features is supported
- wider usage of Linux
but I still think that cons > pros...

In my opinion using binary only modules is equal to modifying your kernel
but being unable to show your modifications so you are on your own and you
shouldn't bring it on lkml.

Useful thing will be to create mailing list about Linux kernel
+ binary only modules and to move discussion from lkml there...
