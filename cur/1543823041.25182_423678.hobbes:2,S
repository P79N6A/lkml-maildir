The overhead is probably high since an allocated pointer needs to be
inserted in a radix tree, together with its aliases. However, no-one
should enable this feature for a production kernel, but only for
debugging (as with Valgrind for user-space, there isn't anyone using
those libraries for production versions).

I haven't looked at DEBUG_SLAB_LEAK in detail but it looks to me like it
only shows the calling address of whoever allocated the object. Kmemleak
detects whether the object is still refered (tracing garbage collection).
So, DEBUG_SLAB_LEAK should be enough if you suspect a memory leak. If
you don't, some leaks might go unnoticed.
