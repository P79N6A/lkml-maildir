Yes, that should solve the ofonly problem, with the offb in the very last of 
the Makefile, though as you said, it's a little hackish, but very simple to 
implement.  This will work for ofonly though, since 
info->fix.name is not necessarily equal to "xxxfb".  For instance, offb set 
"OFfb" in info->fix.name, but the boot option is "offb".
After giving it some thought, I think method 2 might be the best since it 
provides compatibility with the old syntax.  Especially if users expect 
video=xxxfb:off to work.  Also, this brings more flexibility in the offchance 
we decide to add more options to "video=".
I'm willing to work on this, but if you don't like it, then I'll do the 'fail 
at register_framebuffer".
