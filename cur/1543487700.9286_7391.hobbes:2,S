Hi *
SOme days ago i told about the Problem with cdrecord and
Adaptec2940AU/TEAC CD-R55s:
[...]
Judging disk...done.
Calibrating laser...done.
cdrecord: Cannot allocate memory. Cannot send SCSI cmd via ioctl
Under 2.2.x it doesn´t work (2.2.2 fails too!), under 2.0.36 it works
fine.
Is already a patch out? Where can I find it?
Greetings
Raphael Becker
