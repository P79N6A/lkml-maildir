  I have already made a fix and sent it to Andreas and linux-fsdevel.
For ext2 it's actually a bit more complicated because ext2_sync_inode()
can return with ENOSPC (because do_writepages() need not be able to
write the dirty data of the inode) but inode would be written and hence
in that case we should not release the quota (and we should release the
old xattr block properly). Andreas proposed to just call write_inode()
instead of ext2_sync_inode() to avoid the ENOSPC case but then we might
end up with inconsistency between inode metadata and indirect blocks for
SYNC inode (though the only way I see how this can happen is that we
race against file write and the short time inconsistency might be
bearable...).
  I send a combination of mine and Herbert's patch.

Fix a subtle bug in error handling of ext2 xattrs. When ext2_sync_inode() fails
because of ENOSPC (it could not write inode's dirty data) we want to keep
xattrs in a consistent state and release the old block properly.
