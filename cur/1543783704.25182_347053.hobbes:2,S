Actually I think it's rather sick.  Taking O_NONBLOCK and making it a
lock-manager trylock because they're kinda-sorta-similar-sounding?  Spare
me.  O_NONBLOCK means "open this file in nonblocking mode", not "attempt to
acquire a clustered filesystem lock".  Not even close.
It would be much better to do something which explicitly and directly
expresses what you're trying to do rather than this strange "lets do this
because the names sound the same" thing.
What happens when we want to add some new primitive which has no posix-file
analog?
Waaaay too cute.  Oh well, whatever.
