Hi,
  What is the equivalent of sleep in assembly.
  I tried jmps and nops i even kept loops.for jumps
and nops but all in vain .
  Does it make any difference if i am doing this real
mode instead of pmode ? doesnt the functions nop and
jmps   do what they are supposed to do . 16000 nops
doesn't sleep for 1 sec.
Any help would be appreciated.
