 Hi:
	Yesterday, I found a strangeous problem that printk in my OS can't print %d format number, but can print %u, %x ...
	why?
    let's see an example:
			unsigned int memsize;
			memsize=64;
			printk("memsize unknown: setting to %dMB\n",memsize);
			if I use %d to display, the result of memsize is -18446744073709551552MB
            printk("memsize unknown: setting to %uMB\n",memsize);
			if I use %u to display ,the result of memsize is 64MB
	Would you please tell me what leads to this problem?
