That would be the case when you'd send an "I'd like the volume set to
this please" request on the notifier chain.  An audio driver which
implements that is expected to multiply the value in some reasonable way
with the traditional CD mixer input -- you still need master levels and
so on for the 0-100% range to map to sensible volumes, depending on the
sound card.
