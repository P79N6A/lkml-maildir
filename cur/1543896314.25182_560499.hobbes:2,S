Hmm, set top boxes are often rented from the cable company rather than
sold.  Stupid grey area for sure.  At least tivo does give you the
sources, without demanding more money.  Rather big difference.

Well at least where I work we don't try to lock down the hardware, we do
contribute our changes and bug fixes to upstream when it makes sense
(and where our changes wouldn't make sense for upstream, they are still
clearly included with the sources we have.)  If a customer wants a copy
of the sources, they will get a nice DVD, although strangely none have
asked for one yet.
