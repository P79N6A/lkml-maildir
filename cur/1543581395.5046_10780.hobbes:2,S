Note the word "required", meaning "must be done" vs. "recommended"
meaning "should be done".
The initial issue was a comment in a starfire patch that claimed an IA64
bug had been fixed.  The copy breakpoint change might have improved
performance by doing a copy-align, but it didn't fix a bug.
That performance tradeoff was already anticipated: the 'rx_copybreak'
value that was changed was a module parameter, not a constant.  That
allows a module-load-time tradeoff, based the specific implementation,
of copying the received packet or accepting a few unaligned loads of the
usually small IP header.  See the comments in starfire.c, as well as
several other bus-master drivers.
