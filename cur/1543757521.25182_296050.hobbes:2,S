Yes it does. Often the variables declared this way will go into the text
section which is marked read-only. I've used this technique in a few very
small programs to reduce their size (I could strip off both their bss and
data sections to save space). Also, I believe that the compiler is able
to optimize code using consts, but this is pure speculation, I've not
verified it.
