I re-read the code according to your notes. Since I do not have the docs at
hand I am going to trust your word and indeed believe your patch is cleaner.
Only a personal add-on: make it a bit less verbosely talking to the user ;-) I
think we do not need to tell him three times he has i830. One line should be
sufficient. But obviously thats nothing of real importance.

This really looks like an X issue to me and not related to agp.
Thanks for your support, Nicolas.

PS: you propose the patch to l & m :-) we killed yet another oops.
