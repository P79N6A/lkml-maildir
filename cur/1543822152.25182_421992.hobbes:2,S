Con,
As a result of the patch "sched:dont decrease idle sleep avg" 
introduced after 2.6.15, there is a 4% drop in Volanomark 
throughput on our Itanium test machine.  
Probably the following happened:
Compared to previous code, this patch slightly increases 
the the priority boost when a job is woken up.
This adds priority spread and variations to the wait time of jobs
on run queue if we have a lot of similar jobs in the system.
See patch:
