I'm not saying we should merge crap.
You can take any argument too far, and clearly it doesn't mean that we 
should just accept *anything*, because it will magically be gilded by its 
mere inclusion into the kernel. No, I'm not going to argue that.
But I do want to argue against the notion that the only way to raise 
quality is to do it before it gets merged. It's often better to merge 
early, and fix the issues the merge brings up early too!
Release early, release often. That was the watch-word early in Linux 
kernel development, and there was a reason for it. And it _worked_. Did it 
mean "release crap, release anything"? No. But it did mean that things got 
lots more exposure - even if those "things" were sometimes bugs.
