Good - thanks.
+enum {
+	false	= 0,
+	true	= 1
+};
My inclination would have been to write this as the more terse:
+enum { false, true };
But I suspect yours is better, as some readers would not be
confident that the terse form made false == 0 and true == 1.

Good.
I'm delighted that this favors "true, false and bool",
over "TRUE, FALSE and various spellings of BOOLEAN".
Fun stuff to do in the future:
  Convert test_bit() and various other test_*() and
	atomic_*() operators to return bool.
  Convert many TRUE/FALSE to true/false, in a patch of
	similar size to Andrew's March 2006 patch entitled:
	"[patch 1/1] consolidate TRUE and FALSE".
  Convert a variety of spellings of BOOLEAN to "bool".
  Convert routines and variables using the old C
	convention of int/0/1 for boolean to the
	new bool/false/true.
  How do we detect breakage that results from converting
	an apparent boolean to these values, when the
	code actually worked by using more than just
	values 0 and 1 for the variable in question?
  How do we detect any breakage caused by possible changes
	in the sizeof variables whose type we changed?
  Various sparse and/or gcc checks that benefit from
	knowing the additional constraints on bool types.
