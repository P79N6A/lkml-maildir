hello,
when running e2fsck-1-18 (-f)to check a primary linux-partition it
pretends to find bad blocks (short reads beyond block 524292 ). I booted
2.2.14 and repeating the same e2fsck-run finished without any
complaints. I created a new e2fs, running 2.3.41-3 on this partition and
filled it with kernel-source-trees, no errors. Espacially those sources
which should be located in the "badblocks"-range compiled fine. All
other prim/ext. partitions are in good health, e2fsck says.
