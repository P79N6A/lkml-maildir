This is a wrong thing to do IMHO, because it is incompatible with
cross-compilation, and the more the projects will use this method,
the more a nightmare it will become for distro maintainers. At
least when you rely on either a config file or something like this,
it's always possible to make it point to your target system's. But
when you *execute* commands on the build system, chances are that
you will not get the expected result. pcre-config, glib-config and
such are already in this case.
