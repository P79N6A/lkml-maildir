The design's evolution, and your friend's question, are irrelevant. Might
be a nice story, but not relevant to discuss the _current_ design, its
shortcommings, and possible solutions.

Oh, so metafiles could have any names at all. Awful.

Could have been worse, true. Not very much, anyway.

Bad design. As Ted explained, _any_ "normal" name in there will lead to
legacy applications do the wrong thing unaware of the special status of
this stuff, and this is sure to break things and/or to lead to nasty
security problems.

What kind of builtins? What is a "plugin"?

If it is not important, let's postpone any discussion on it until (if ever)
the important problems are solved.

English, please.

So it isn't mandated, and I could decide placing my own stuff under other
names, willy-nilly? See the comment above on "normal names" being
dangerous; if it hasn't a builtin way of ensuring legacy (or even new
applications) don't trip over this stuff, it is a moby nightmare security
and correctness wise.

"Common" and "current usage" is important to the average user, "normal" is
crucial for correctness and security,

So far, I've seen no real reason to introduce this. If it is scrapped,
there will be no need to talk anybody out of silly ideas.
