I wonder if the flash filesystems could be told via mount options that they're 
to use a normal block device as if it was a flash with granularity X?
They can't explicitly control erase, but writing to any block in a block group 
will erase and rewrite the whole group so they can just do large write 
transactions close to each other and the device should aggregate enough for an 
erase block.  (Plus don't touch anything _outside_ where you guess an erase 
block to be until you've finished writing the whole block, which they 
presumably already do.)
The other question is whether there's any way to guess an erase granularity 
that's "good enough" for a device of size X, maybe larger than the device 
actually does but not smaller than any remotely sane manufacturer would 
implement.  (And just _don't_ partition these suckers, so you don't have to 
worry about partitions aligning with erase block sizes.)
