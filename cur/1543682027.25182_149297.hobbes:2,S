I've got one more problem with 2.5.75/2.6.0t1 - I cannot 
stop kernel logs from appearing on my console. Usually 
dmesg -n X was good enough[*], but now it doesn't work as 
I expect....
Any ideas?
[*] I've got many different iptables [non 'critical'] logging 
    rules and I'm using klogd
util-linux: 2.11z (as in Debian SID).
