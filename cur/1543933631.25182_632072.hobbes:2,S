In those situations I think only one interface is better. For example, 
above will be broken if somebody kexec 4 kernels.
A-->B--->C--->D
I think better option might be if it is stack like situation. A kernel
shows you only the previous kernel's memory contents through /proc/vmcore
interface. So If I am in kernel D, I see only kernel C's memory image.
To see kernel B's memory image, one shall have to go back to kernel C.
