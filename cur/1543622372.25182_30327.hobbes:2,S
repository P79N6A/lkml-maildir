Ken Brownfield's A) and B) hit me
regularly(
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0201.0/0740.html
)
(Thanks Ken for starting this enlightening thread and
to all those that contributed)
Running software I developed:
- running on 2.4.17
- accessing a large number of files
- 2GB memory
- large multiple partitions - ext2
I saw references to patches by Martin and
M.H.vanLeeuwen on this thread. Where can I get those
(hopefully with a bit of info) ?
I also saw references to 'rmap' on the 2.4.18
changelog. Is that related ?
pls. cc' me on your posts back.
Thanks
Aviv
