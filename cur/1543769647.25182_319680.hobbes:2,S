Lennart,
 From the beginning we are talking about the present GNU/Linux systems, 
which do already use NTPL in standard. NPTL is no future standard, it is 
present standard.
This means basicly that 50% of your assertions (like the above) are 
wrong, and your conclusions "suffer" from that :)
The point is that if you make a ps on a decent Linux based system, you 
will *NOT* see one process for each thread. Nor they do appear in /proc.
This means there are *NOT* userland processes.
And therefore, you shall *NOT* be able to reference them as such where a 
process ID is required.
