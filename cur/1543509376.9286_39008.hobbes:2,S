As far as I know, completion ports still have the demultiplexing done in
a single place, so in that model you still have to have extra explicit
application/library cooperation to let libraries share queues.

There is.  The existing kernel supports sending a separate, higher
priority event to notify the application of overflow, and poll is a
sufficient recovery mechanism.  You don't expect overflow to be a
common, performance-critical case.

Who is talking about POSIX aio?  That is a totally different API.  For
the purposes in question --- networking IO --- leave POSIX aio well
alone, Unix O_NONBLOCK plus completion events is a perfectly adequate
API.  The async IO API is not necessary or desirable.

See the previous point: you'd be crazy to want aio_writev on a socket.
