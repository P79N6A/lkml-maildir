This does not make any sense.
The user is free to load any selector in %cs/%ds/%es/%ss so the default
flat segments should be left alone so that a process can have the flat
segments _plus_ all the tls entries.

AFAIK this only matters for code and stack segments and anyway the APM
one should be a 16-bit entry since it exists because the BIOS wrongly
assumes that it is a real-mode segment.
Anyway, isn't it better to put the user segments in a cacheline that
doesn't already lose one entry to the null selector? (and leave the
first one either empty or for BIOS/boot selectors)
