Nice. I am one of the main b43 developers and I wrote most of the code.
I know most of the code from the top of my head.
Besides that my weiner is bigger than yours. :P

It is not an issue. You can even rmmod rfkill-input in FULL operation.
It will not disturb the operation, except that an LED stops working.
Try it! (I _did_ try it).

The b43 does print _nothing_ on modprobe. That is _correct_ behaviour.
b43 does print the firmware message after "ifconfig up".
Might it be possible that this was coincidence and you messed
with modprobe rfkill and ifconfig up and finally saw the message?

Ok. So please revert that patch and try to reproduce the breakage.
Does that work?

I am inhuman. We all know that.
(That was a joke that you probably don't understand. But you can google
for "bcw vs. bcm43xx" :) )
Ray, I _do_ want to understand what is going on in your machine.
I _have_ to understand it. But I currently do not understand how the
quoted patch could fix modprobe of b43 or rfkill. I'd simply call that
impossible.
Impossible because the patch does change a few function called _inside_
of the b43 module. How could that fix load of the b43 module? (Note that
we are not changing some modprobe magic like the ID table).
So could you please try to reproduce the breakage by reverting that
patch again? Just to make really sure it is this patch fixing the issue
and not just some coincidence.
Thanks for your help.
