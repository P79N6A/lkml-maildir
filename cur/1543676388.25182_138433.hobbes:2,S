Yes, and I agree that it's important that this gets fixed.
Also, the code was basically unmaintained for about two
years, and that shows.
I'm just pointing out that "asynchronizing" some internal
process that is perfectly happy with being synchronous
(and consistent with the semantics of ATM, which themselves
are quite "funny" most of the time) strikes me as a not
very helpful move.

Nope, pure DIY. Actually, I think at the time when I wrote
that stuff ('95), SIOC* still ruled the world ...
