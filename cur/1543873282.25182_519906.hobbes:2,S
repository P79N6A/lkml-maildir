Fine.
The thing is others and I (and you) are working on getting paravirt_ops
working for x86_64.  There's a lot of overlap between i386 and x86_64.
Right now the i386 is ahead of x86_64 and the code seems to be put more
in the arch/i386 arch.  So now we are going to introduce a
new ../../i386 hack to get to a shared paravirt_shared.c(?).  Or do we
just continue on keeping the x86_64 as a separate entity, with a lot of
duplicate code?
I'm OK with either way. I just wanted to set a standard while it's still
early enough to set one.
