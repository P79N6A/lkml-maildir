I tested it on a few machines of course.

I would need the loopstats over a few days to really say something about 
this. It may also depend on the stability of your remote NTP serer. The 
new code adjusts a little a slower, but should be overall a little more 
stable.
The ntpd does basically "if (!pll_nano) ntv.constant = sys_poll - 4;" to 
adjust for the difference in behaviour of the two models, but this causes 
rather fast adjustments. In the NTP4 patch I undo this adjustment for the 
new model.

Well, upto the NTP4 patch the behaviour should be mostly unchanged.
