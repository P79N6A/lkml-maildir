I'm running Redhat 5.2 with 2.2.1 and net-tools 1.50
and I get the following.. I don't know if this is because of a kernel bug or a
bug in net-tools, I thought maybe someone here could look at it and find out.
When I attempt to take down an aliased interface with something like:
ifconfig eth0:0 down
it removes the eth0:0 interface but ALSO removes eth0.
The only way I've found to remove the eth0:0 interface without removing the
primary interface is to do this:
ifconfig eth0:0 0.0.0.0
Which causes it to disappear from the list of interfaces.
Is this expected behaviour? If so, why?
