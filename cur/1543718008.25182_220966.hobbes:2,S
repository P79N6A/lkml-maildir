They were in the original email on the kernel mailing list:
	hservnlds:/home /net/hservnlds/home nfs rw,nosuid,nodev,v3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,udp,lock,addr=sservnlds 0 
The only thing there is that "intr". Maybe something has broken so that 
non-lethal signals also trigger errors? That could explain it (partial 
reads or writes when a timer goes off, or something).
