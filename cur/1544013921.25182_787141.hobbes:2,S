No I should have said from a UTC time to a value, the reverse is slightly
ambiguous - as you say leap seconds cannot be distinguished (well unless
you are using floating point but thats a whole can of worms)
Glibc has /usr/share/zoneinfo/right as well as posix zones which I guess
is Ulrich's vote on the subject.
In a strictly posix environment then for 1003.1 post 2001 the definition
is non-leap seconds since (a notional) 1/1/70 UTC 00:00:00. Including
leap seconds in the definition would have caused problems with existing
date stamps moving them by about half a minute.
The kernel doesn't give a brass monkeys about interpretation on the whole
with one main exception - the CMOS RTC time conversion is done without
factoring in leap seconds.
