I'm not disagreeing with the SMP bit.  In my very first reply, I
disagree with the hunk that disable CONFIG_MCKINLEY for CONFIG_IA64_GENERIC.
People tends to mix the terminology, CONFIG_IA64_GENERIC is a
platform type choice, it is a sub-requirement for building a
kernel that boots everywhere.  People keeps on promoting the
config option.

This hunk does not make any logical sense.  Select generic system type
does not mean Itanium processor is the only choice I can have.  What's
wrong with having an option that works just fine right now?
