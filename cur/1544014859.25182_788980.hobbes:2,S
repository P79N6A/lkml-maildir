Ahh, don't look at that!  The embarrassment is unbearable!  Go away!
Yes, I used to have a special exception for a 0 key.  But I also have
a special exception for a NULL value and can test against that instead
of testing against a 0 key.  It is even faster, because the value is not
variable-sized.  In hindsight it is hard to explain why I ever did that.
