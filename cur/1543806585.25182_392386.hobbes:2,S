The user should use what the OS uses. Cdrecord, or libscg, respectively, 
can invent any numbers it wants. IOW, "we" (read: I) would like to see
  cdrecord -dev=/dev/hdc on Linux
I am not sure if I understood your other mail on the cdrecord ML, but if 
the proper syntax would be
  cdrecord -dev=/dev/hdc:@
then
  /dev/hdc
could just be transparently turned into
  /dev/hdc:@
somewhere within the getopt part.
for other OS:
  cdrecord -dev=/dev/acd0 on FreeBSD
  cdrecord -dev=E: on Win32
    cdrecord -dev=\\cdrom0 if someone really wants for Win32
  cdrecord -dev=/dev/c0t0s0d0 on Solaris
(Don't shoot me. I unfortunately have to make a guess, since I have 
not done yet any cdrecord'ing[1] on OS other than Linux.)
[1] Well with Nero, but that's not cdrecord, as in "cdrecord'ing". :)
