Second thought, unless told how to use a "vendor specific extention"
the current interface the kernel will for force it to be wrong and
potentially damage if not kill.
On the full taskfile will allow access correctly if you know how to use
this "vendor specific extention" otherwise you are testing for bad mortor
rounds with a hammer.  The bad fuse will get you.
