Yep, this is one of those bugs.  IMHO, the kernel should
continue operating normally on 32-bit-int machines, even
if user programs that format stuff in ASCII get confused.
As a general principle, code that looks like this
  if (time > threshold)
should be shot if there's any chance of wraparound, ever.
It's better to use an idiom like
  if (((long)(time - threshold)) > 0)
which simply keeps on working in the face of wraparound.
The kernel provides nice macros for this already in timer.h:
 *      These inlines deal with timer wrapping correctly. You are
 *      strongly encouraged to use them
 *      1. Because people otherwise forget
 *      2. Because if the timer wrap changes in future you wont have to
 *         alter your driver code. ...
 */
#define time_after(a,b)         ((long)(b) - (long)(a) < 0)                 
I suspect there aren't too places in the kernel that
screw up and don't use these macros; it would be nice
to clean them all up, as a matter of principle.  It won't
bloat the kernel at all, and it brings it one step
closer to making 100 year uptimes possible.
