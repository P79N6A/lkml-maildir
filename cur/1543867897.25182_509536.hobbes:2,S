> What are you talking about?  This is not about software patents AT ALL.
Yes, it is. The difference between a copyright and a patent is this
simple -- a copyright protects the one particular way you chose to do
something and a patent protects every possible way of doing the same thing
(or employing the same method).

That's exactly what they're doing. Knowing only the *function* of his
program, they are claiming it must obey their licensing terms. They have no
idea exactly how he chose to implement that function, but claim they must
own it anyway.

Not quite. Copyright is: This particular implementation is mine, but you are
free to implement any idea any *other* way you want. You simply can't
implement an idea precisely the way I did it, but all ideas are open to you.

But that's not what's happening here. "A Linux driver for graphics cards
based on the X1950 chipset" is not an "add on" to Linux. It's an idea and a
function all on its own.

I do not have them confused. You cannot own "any practical way to make a
driver for Linux" under copyright, only patent gives you that kind of power.
You can, of course, own "the particular way I chose to make a Linux driver,
out of many other equally-good ways".
