Subject: legal to call tasklet_schedule() from within schedule()?

I'm noodling around with some way to print out error messages from 
within the scheduler itself.  One way that I'm considering is to copy 
messages to a static memory buffer and then trigger a tasklet to do the 
actual printing.  The question I had was whether it's actually legal to 
call tasklet_schedule() from within the schedule() function, or whether 
that could lead to bad things.  Can anyone give me a definitive 
statement on this?
Does anyone have any other suggestions on the best way to do this?
Thanks,
Chris
