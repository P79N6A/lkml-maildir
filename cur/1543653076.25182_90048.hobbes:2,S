So how 'bout this:
* mark all drivers that don't compile OBSOLETE.  That keeps us from
   trying to fix drivers without having hardware to test them.
   Anyone with proper hardware is invited to fix the drivers and then
   mark them non-OBSOLETE.
* make 'curyesconfig' and 'curmodconfig' compile everything that isn't OBSOLETE
* fix anything left over that keeps 'make curyesconfig'
   and 'make curmodconfig' from compiling
* maintainers try to not forward any patches to Linux that
   cause 'make curyesconfig' or 'make curmodconfig' not build
* OSDL does nightly 'curyesconfig' and 'curmodconfig builds from
   Linus's tree, and mails linux-kernel a link to the build log
   along with whether it succeeded or failed
That would give maintainers quick feedback about whether they'd
broken some obscure part of Linus's tree...
