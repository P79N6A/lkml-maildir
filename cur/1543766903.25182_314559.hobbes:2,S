"atime" is really nasty for a filesystem. I don't know if anybody noticed, 
but git already uses O_NOATIME to open all the object files, because if 
you don't do that, then just looking at a full kernel tree (which has more 
than a thousand subdirectories) will cause nasty IO patterns from just 
writing back "atime" information for the "tree" objects we looked up.
So you can do (and git does) selective atime updates. It just requires a 
small amount of extra care.

Probably a good idea.
