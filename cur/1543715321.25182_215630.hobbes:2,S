Hello,
I have an ASUS CUV4XD dual CPU mobo that I've been using with Window 2000
Professional for the last two years. It worked fine, W2K used both CPUs with
no problems whatsoever. I recently upgraded my W2K system, and decided to
use the ASUS board in a system I was building to use as a Linux gateway. The
problem I'm having is the system refuses to boot when I created a kernel
with SMP support. If I turn off SMP and rebuild the kernel, boots fine. I
have two other SMP systems, very old mother boards, 5+ years old. They both
run Linux fine with SMP. I even took the source tree from a working system,
built a new kernel, locks up on bootup. The last message displayed :
Total of 2 processors activated ( 3186.68 BogoMIPS)
Enabling IO-APIC IRQs
Setting 2 in the phys_id_present_map
... changing IO-APIC physical APIC ID to 2 ... ok.
I contacted Alan Cox about this, he said he was working on his MBa and
hadn't been involved with kernel development for a while. He suggest adding:
append="noapic pci=usepirqmask"
to the lilo.conf file, which I did. No change.
Any body have similar problems or suggestions?
TIA,
Bobby
