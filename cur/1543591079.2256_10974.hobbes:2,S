Only the ioctl part, though I confess to trolling for a better proposal ... :)

For links without a stable MAC, /.../net/<ifname>/{pci-slot,usb-path,...}
is more like it, but I think that class of solution should be fine.
Now ... what should be the roles of "regular" file ops, devfs, usbdevfs,
procfs, and "devreg" ?  That's the part that doesn't seem simple yet.
I'd expect a few rounds of code/design changes.
