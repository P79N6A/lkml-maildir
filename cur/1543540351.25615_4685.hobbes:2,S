Hi,
I have put a 34Kb patch on 
http://www.fenrus.demon.nl/compile.diff
 which
fixes most known compilation bugs in 2.4.0-test5. This patch is also sent
to Linus and/or the respective maintainers in small pieces.
There are 5 known issues left:
1) MS-DOS partition code doesn't tolerate IDE to be a module
2) The MIRO radio card has a forward-dependency on the ACI mixer 
   (Config.in bug)
3) The SIS framebuffer doesn't play nice with modversions.h
4) The com2000 arcnet driver uses a non-existent "clock" struct member
5) x25/wan doesn't compile without lapb
More info on these issues is available on request.
Greetings,
   Arjan van de Ven
