At least historically gcc has been so f*cking bad at the "unsigned vs 
signed" warnings that they are totally useless.
Maybe things are better in gcc-3.3.
Maybe not.

Does gcc still warn about things like
	#define COUNT (sizeof(array)/sizeof(element))
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < COUNT; i++)
		...
where COUNT is obviously unsigned (because sizeof is size_t and thus 
unsigned)?
Gcc used to complain about things like that, which is a FUCKING DISASTER. 
Any compiler that complains about the above should be shot in the head, 
and the warning should be killed.
