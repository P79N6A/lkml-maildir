Filtering on BSSID is necessary for management frames, especially when 
multicast management frames are thrown into the mix.  
For example, STAs are supposed to respect broadcast disassoc/deauth
messages, but of course should ignore them if they're not destined for
the local BSSID. 
The only extra-BSS management frames that should not be dropped are are
beacons and probe responses.  That said, probe responses are directed so
our A1 (RA) filter will probably drop the frame if it is not destined
for us.
