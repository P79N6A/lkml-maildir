Thanks for the suggestions.  The FIQ solutions sounds like the one to 
use.  I'll probably do a little testing sometime in the next few weeks 
to determine the maximum loading I can place on the processor when 
running some of the other peripherals simultaneously.  If I have time 
I'll test the -RT patches as well and post up some numbers for this 
processor.
