Hi Pavel,
Killing the printk's means they are not around if you have an end user
who is running into problems at boot time. Having a feature like this
means they can default to 'off' then if a problem arises, whoever is
doing the support can ask the user to try and enable printk's for say
SCSI and get the input, without haven to rebuild the kernel from
scratch.
For people supporting large numbers of users (like all the
distributions) this seems like a good win to me.
Cheers,
Jes
