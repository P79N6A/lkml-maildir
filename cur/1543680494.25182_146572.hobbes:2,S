Subject: PCMCIA can't be probed during kernel loading????

hello all:
	I am triying to get NFS mount root working on a DELL inspiron
	laptop, with only a PCMCIA card ( 3com589D ). I builtin the NFS_ROOT 
	support and hardware drivers into the kernel. Then booted the kernel
	but the eth0 is not discovered, and the messages show that cardbus
	can't probe any card. 
	I mean should the kernel be able to find the card itself and set it
	up , or does it need some user application ( like cardmgr ) to do it
	? if it's the latter case, basically means it's impossible to run a
	diskless station over NFS with only PCMCIA network card?
	thanks a lot
	Yang
