I know this is an old thread but I seem to be having a problem similar
to this and I didn't find any real resolution in the archives.
I'm using the rt16 patch on 2.6.16.5 with complete preemption. I have a
high priority rt compute bound task that isn't getting signals from a
pci cards interrupt handler. Only when I insure the rt priority of the
task is lower than the rt priority of the irq thread ([IRQ 193]) will my
task receive signals.
Is this a bug? Is the bug in my interrupt handler? Or is this expected
and acceptable?
Thanks
Mark
