For those who've sold their GPL soul to use the binary drivers from NVIDIA...
NVIDIA have announced a new release of their graphic card drivers:
version '1.0-5336' 
http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux.html
This release has support for Linux 2.6 kernels, fixes AGP failures on
some VIA motherboards, and fixes a problem that prevented X from
running on Samsung X10 laptops.
