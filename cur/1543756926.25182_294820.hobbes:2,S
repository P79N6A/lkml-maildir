I think it would be relatively simple and sane to modify the existing
kmap() implementations to add a new try_kmap() which is atomic and returns
failure if it would have needed to sleep.
That being said, kmap() is a sort of old and deprecated thing which scales
badly on SMP.  We've put considerable work into moving over to
kmap_atomic() and using nice tight short code regions where atomic
kmappings are held.
