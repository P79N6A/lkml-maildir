Hmmm, the message you're replying to seems to have just emerged from a
black hole... I sent it to vger three months ago.
I'm not sure what the issues were now... I ran into it quite a while
ago, and I didn't have access to an affected laptop at the time.  I
think one of the issues was that a system could start out in the
"slow" mode and later clock up, which would shorten all the udelay's.
There was a timed loop in the 3c589 driver for reading the EEPROM,
that seemed to fail if the clock was sufficiently faster OR slower
than it was supposed to be.
