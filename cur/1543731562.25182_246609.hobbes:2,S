The ide-scsi driver handles multiple luns but in 2.4 the default
behaviour most vendors shipped was "do not probe extra luns". There is a
scsi black/whitelist table that is used to vary the behaviour or the
max_scsi_luns option to the scsi layer should also work.
2.6 is meant to be a bit more intelligent about this and my Nakamichi CD
changer seems to do the right thing.
