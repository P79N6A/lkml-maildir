	Just a data point, but when I have trusted IRIX installed,
there is no booting up in non-trusted mode.  Capabilities are in 
effect even in single-user.  To get non-trusted, I'd have to boot from
some other media.  If I wanted to secure that, I'd have to remove the
floppy and CDROM and not allow network boots.  I put a lock on the box
to the table and lock the cover closed (most seem to have that option).
	Now I've secured that computer pretty much as I can -- yes,
someone can come in with a crow-bar, but -- well, people can use
explosives to get into a bank vault too.  
	It appears (I just installed "TRIX" for the first time only
recently), that when you install the TRIX security option on top of
a standard system, one of the things it does is set the capabilities
for a bunch of system files -- which ones are trusted and which
not, etc.  Once you reboot, your basic CAPs are set and enforced when
the new kernel comes up.  Pretty spiffy!
