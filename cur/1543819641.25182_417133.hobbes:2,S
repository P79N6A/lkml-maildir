I need to do setup a console to get the dmesg from 2.6.16 since I have two SCSI 
controllers and several drives. I don't want to muck around with changing 
/etc/fstab and such. That said:

In all circumstances, 2.6.15 compiles the advansys driver. 2.6.16 never 
compiles the advansys driver and, even when I add the CONFIG_SCSI_ADVANSYS=y to 
the .config, it strips out the config option before compiling:
gunzip -c kernel/config_data.gz | less
# CONFIG_ISCSI_TCP is not set
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_3W_XXXX_RAID is not set
# CONFIG_SCSI_3W_9XXX is not set
# CONFIG_SCSI_ACARD is not set
# CONFIG_SCSI_AACRAID is not set
CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX=y
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE=32
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_RESET_DELAY_MS=15000
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_DEBUG_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_DEBUG_MASK=0
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_REG_PRETTY_PRINT=y
# CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX_OLD is not set
# CONFIG_SCSI_AIC79XX is not set
# CONFIG_SCSI_DPT_I2O is not set
# CONFIG_MEGARAID_NEWGEN is not set
# CONFIG_MEGARAID_LEGACY is not set
for some reason, 2.6.16 is stripping out all support for the advansys driver. 
I've included a full copy of my 2.6.15 .config (taken from /proc/config.gz on 
my running system) as well as the 2.6.16 .config from make oldconfig
