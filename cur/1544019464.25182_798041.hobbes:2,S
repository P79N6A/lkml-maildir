An sg list of pages would be perfect for my usage. I didn't want to
change an existing kernel interface, so I just made the easiest change
that worked for me.
Another thing that could be done is trimming the vmalloc() down to the
exact size needed after the firmware has finished loading. That would
still waste memory until the copy from userspace is finished, though.
I'd be happy to test patches anyone comes up with.
Thanks,
