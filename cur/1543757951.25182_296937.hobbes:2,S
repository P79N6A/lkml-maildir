Hi,
Can you please let me know, what all files does the OS look into to
load modules?
I see the following messages during boot rather installation:
======
Finished bus probing
modules to insert tg3 aic79xx
======
which files does the OS look into to load tg3 and aic79xx after
finishing bus probing. I guess modprobe.conf, modules.alias,
modules.pcimap.
with regards,
    Anil
