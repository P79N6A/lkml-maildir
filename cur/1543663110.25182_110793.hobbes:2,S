User control, yes.  System control can (and should) be fine grained.
Define "slow" when someone turns the framebuffer display off and you
don't need to satisfy its minimum requirement while you do still need
to keep something running in the background.
So now we have "slow", "not so slow" and "fast".
As I say, user control is by all means "I want fast" or "I want power
save" but you can't define "fast" and "slow" to mean anything without
examining the rest of the system state.
