It's safe but horrid.  Look closer and you'll find there isn't even
an mm to hold the mmap_sem of.  The struct vm_area_struct is on the
stack of shmem_alloc_page, and exists solely to apply mempolicy to
a shmem file via an interface designed for mempolicy on vmas.
So far as I know, it works fine; but that interface really ought
to be redesigned some time - it looks like a quick hack that stuck.
