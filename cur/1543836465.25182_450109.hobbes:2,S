There is no native harware virtualization system in this picture.  Maybe
I'm just misunderstanding you.

This seems a bit like a trumped up example, as randomly disabling a part
of the pv interface is likely to cause correctness issues, not just
performance degradation.
Hypervisor compatibility is a slightly separate issue here.  There's two
interfaces.  The linux paravirt interface is internal to the kernel.
The hypervisor interface is external to the kernel.
kernel <--pv interface--> paravirt glue layer <--hv interface--> hypervisor
So changes to the hypervisor must remain ABI compatible to continue
working with the same kernel.  This is the same requirement the kernel
has with the syscall interface it provides to userspace.

Distro of choice.  Current kernel with the pv patches[1], but be
forewarned, they are very early, and not fully booting.
