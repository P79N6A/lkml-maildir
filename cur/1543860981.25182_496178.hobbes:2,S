In the worst case, when free/used extents are small, some free oids are
"leaked", but this has never been problem in practice. In fact, there
was a patch for reiserfs v3 to store this map in special hidden file but
it wasn't included in mainline, as nobody ever complained about oid map
fragmentation.

Indeed, this is fundamental problem. Reiser4 tries to ameliorate it by
using hash function that starts colliding only when there are billions
of files, in which case 32bit inode number is screwed anyway.
Note, that none of the above problems invalidates reasons for having
long in-kernel inode identifiers that I outlined in other message.
