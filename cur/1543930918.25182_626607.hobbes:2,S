There are different ways you can connect to the Firmware and it all depends on
the ME subsystem you want to communicate with.
For Intel AMT, you would use LMS (Local Manageability Service) which acts as a
proxy for SOAP messages coming for management applications. LMS is available via
http://openamt.org/wiki/LocalManageabilityService.
The demo we had for storing kernel oops messages in the firmware used the AMT
1.0 interface (legacy) which allowed direct access to 3PDS using the MEI driver
interfaces. In AMT 3.0 (current platforms) this has been disabled and only SOAP
is possible which is why in the demo we changed the ME firmware to use AMT 1.0.
To have a feel for all of this, with many examples, samples and documentation
you can download the AMT 3.0 SDK (google: intel amt sdk).
