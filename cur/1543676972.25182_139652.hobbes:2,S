These were not set when the error occured. I found this option after the
crash somewhere on the net, but I can't find any references to it on
google at the moment :( Can it cause that severe filesystem corruption ?
Was DMA enabled on your system, and what drives did you use ?
I tested several firmware revisions, disabled mmio in the driver,
nothing helped. No DMA at boot, and the crash is easy to reproduce, for
example:
console1: dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null
console2: hdparm -X66 -d1 /dev/hda
result without max_kb_per_request:
---
/dev/hda:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
blk: queue c0468b00, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff)
 setting xfermode to 66 (UltraDMA mode2)
hda: dma_intr: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hda: dma_intr: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hda: DMA disabled

The system hangs and nothing is written to syslog.
I don't know where to look next.
