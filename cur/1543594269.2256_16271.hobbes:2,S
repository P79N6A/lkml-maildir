Not really - it prevents another processor entering the same code
segment  (spin_lock_irqsave prevents both another processor and
local interrupts).
An interrupt on UP can not wait on a spin lock - it will never be released
since no other code than the interrupt spinning will be able to execute)

SMP compiled kernel, but running on UP hardware - right?
Then this _should not_ happen!
see linux/Documentation/spinlocks.txt
Is it your spinlocks that are causing this, or?

It does not matter, if there is contention - let it take time. Waiting is what
spinlocking is about anyway...
