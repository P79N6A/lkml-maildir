Please forgive the double indent.
I have tried the patch you recommended and have exactly the same symptoms.

I have had some time to clear my thoughts on this now.
First, the expire is done using a while in the daemon. It continues until 
the ioctl returns non zero.
I believe the sequence of events is:
Expire locates an expireable dentry and sends a message to the daemon to 
do the umount and returns 0. The ioctl runs with the BKL.
The Naultilus process triggers a revalidate during the expire and waits 
till that iteration of the expire finishes before continuing. The 
revalidate leads to a lookup which takes the BKL.
Meanwhile the expire enters the ioctl again but is blocked on the BKL.
The lookup sends a mount request to the daemon which it cannot hear 
because it is still waiting for the expire to finish.
While this is a plausible description with the code as it is, I 
have found that even if I bracket the revalidate with a BKL the problem 
still occurs. 
So there is something else I am missing. I don't know what it is.

If my description above where correct then forcing the expire to finish 
would lead to the correct behaviour.

I still think that it is a O(1) effect. When the sleeping processes awake 
it is possible that the scheduler does not pick the expire process as it 
was the most recent of the processes to run.

Again if my explanation is close to correct then the question is what is 
the proper way to force the execution order? Using a completion as well as 
the wait perhaps?
