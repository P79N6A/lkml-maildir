Yes, you are rigth.
But again, with Byte Unix version 4.1 I got much
more intersting result with no "strange" numbers,
I tried that test few hours ago,.
I know I can disable APM from both the kernel and the BIOS but I'd like to test the kernel I use in "daily" usage. What do you think about it? Do you suggest me to use a different configuration when I run the test?
And, what are the "best" benchmark?
I use dbench, LMbench, and Unix Bench Ver4.1.
Cheers {ciao},
