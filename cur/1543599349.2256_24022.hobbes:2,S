Then it's a bug that should _not_ be fixed in the min macro. Unsigned
values should be hold in unsigned variables. If it's that common, please
show me a sane and realistic example.

It's not stupid, it does the right thing for the majority of the cases.
A cast just hides the problem. If you need a broken min macro to get
people thinking, you have a much bigger problem.

You maybe fixed a few bugs, but this new macro will only cause new
problems in the future. If we change only a single type, you have to
scan all min/max users if they possibly need to be changed too. Thanks
to the cast, the compiler won't even remotely help you finding them.
