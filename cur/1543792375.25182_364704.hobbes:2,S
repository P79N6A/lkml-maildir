Actually, BenH just pointed out that the version of update_mmu_cache()
we now have from the 64k patch already half-handled this situation -
it wouldn't actually do anything on a hugepage fault, but it wouldn't
blow up either.  So the COW patch should work as is on ppc64, although
the update_mmu_cache change is probably an important optimization
(otherwise we'll take two faults on every COW - one to actually do the
COW, and one to twiddle the bits in the hash page table).
