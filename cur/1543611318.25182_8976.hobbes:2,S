Unfortunately, this seems to only list the routes in the main routing table, and
these routes are recreated automatically when I bring the link back up.
The problem is that I have routes in multiple other routing tables, and they
don't show up in this command.  I assume I'd have to run a similar command for
each routing table, which is kind of a pain.
If the driver re-init is totally separate from the routing code, is there any
real reason why shutting down the driver *should* remove all routes to that
device?  Maybe the simplest solution would be a new ioctl that would be a link
*reset*...just down/up the link without affecting anything else....
