init_task is the task_struct for process 0, "swapper".  But by the time we
run the initcalls, process 1 ("init") is up and running.
So by the time you execute these assignments, you're changing the limits on
a process which will never again create any children.
It's a bit hacky, but you could do
	BUG_ON(current->pid != 1);
	current->rlim[RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE].rlim_cur = 64;
but longer-term these initialisations should be moved into
include/asm-foo/reousrce.h:INIT_RLIMITS
