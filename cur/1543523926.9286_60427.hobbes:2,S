So that the behaviour of a program does not depend on whether a register
is spilled.  So that you get consistent results from the same code.
The current behaviour means you may compile a program and get certain
results.  Then you add a line at the start of the function, and the
complicated calculation at the end now gives different results.
It is not nice for your program to print out different values because
you changed a different part of the program, and it isn't necessary.
Numerical codes, simple things like minimum finders and iterative
solvers, depend on such behaviour.

Yes.

Possibly.  That is the other point of view that occurs whenever this
debate appears on the egcs list.  You would think that on an x86, to do
that all you do is set the precision register to calculate in 64 bit
precision instead of 80 bits.
Unfortunately, that is not quite perfect.  The x86 FPU does not restrict
the exponent in calculations to the range of `double'.  So the
underflow, overflow and denormal values all work out wrong.  The only
way to guarantee calculations work in 64 bits is to write the results to
memory and read them back.  -ffloat-store does that.

It does.  It also uses 80 bits for intermediate calculations because
that is what the x86 FPU does, even when you are loading and storing in
the 64 bit format.
BTW, the 80 bit extended precision format historically only requires 8
byte alignment.  I don't know if there's any advantage in giving it
bigger alignment nowadays.
