Why are you nodding to OS X?  It's not a real micokernel either.  It
just happens to have all the foobage of a microkernel in a rather
monolithic design.  The reason that the bsd personality is in the same
address space as the mach bits is because they didn't want to deal
with the overheads of the message passing from kernel to userspace.
The L4 people figured out how to get a lot of those inefficiencies to
disappear and L4Linux is quite "performant".  In some cases, L4Linux
can be used to provide a device driver for other L4 threads that would
normally have to write their own [in user space and even with
respectable performance

That's an interesting re-use and combination of several philosophies
if you ask me.
There is a lot of "what's next for linux" going on behind the scenes
and the current path of linux is apparently good enough for
accomplishing it.
