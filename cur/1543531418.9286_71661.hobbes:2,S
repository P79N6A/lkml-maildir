The vm changes between pre3-5 and pre3-7 seems to have eliminated this
issue for me. If I do the same test as before, swap goes from 23 MB
committed quickly back to only 4 MB after emacs closure, not 17 MB as it
did in pre3-5.  It now works much better for me; there's nothing like
putting the system under memory load and seeing that it still has to deal
with the cruft from the last serious operation. Which was why I inquired
about it. :) 
So, does pre3-7+ help you in this regard?
