Actually I don't see, but I'll respect the author's wishes when they don't 
want something indexed.

There are a number of areas of the kernel that give a deep sense of 
achievement upon figuring out what the heck is going on.  This includes 
theoretically documented ones, like the SCSI layer, which I'm working on but 
it makes my little brain hurt.
(Of course my brain hurts _more_ after reading yesterday's email from James 
Bottomley politely and thoroughly answering my first round of questions, but 
I now have a whole new mailing list to bother.  The fact I'm moving back to 
Austin this weekend and have to go pack a truck kind of screws up the 
scheduling of this, but I'll get back to making my brain hurt next week.)

Er, you're welcome?
