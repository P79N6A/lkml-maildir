I'm not going to give up my right to make errors until I'm ready to give up 
my keyboard.  I'll probably be pushing up daisies at that point in my life.
How about:
   for ( ... ) if (!isalnum(*p) && !strchr("-_", *p)) return -EINVAL;
I think that is correct.  However, it fails the "easy to understand" 
criterion, so I don't like it.]
