No.  The changes that broke it are to do with the sizes[]
being gone, I think.  That yours?
/dev/cciss/c0d1 shows up in /proc/partitions, but not
/dev/cciss/c0d1p1 or /dev/cciss/c0d1p7
All the partitions of /dev/cciss/c0d0 show up.
(still broken in 2.5.31, of course)
I'm having some trouble with instability of 2.5.3[01],
don't know if it's just life with 2.5, or maybe my userland
is too old for my kernel...(redhat 7.1) Anyway, it's 
slowing me down, running fsck constantly after puking. :-(
