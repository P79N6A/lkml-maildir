Subject: 2.2.14 nfs problems on both client and server
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The machines are using a 3com905b card with the following kernel 
driver [*] 3c590/3c900 series (592/595/597) "Vortex/Boomerang"
Both are SMP SCSI driven machines and interlinked via a 3com switch.
On NFS Server:
Feb  3 07:01:16 corn kernel: eth0: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status
e000. 
On NFS Client (web server):
Feb  3 07:01:18 cherry kernel: nfs: server corn not responding, timed out 
After this the client was still pingable, but nothing could connect to
the machine or do anything.  It seemed to be blocked by the NFS calls and
did not try again.  A power cycle was required to fix the machine.  The
server seemed to recover w/o problems.
Thanks for your help!
