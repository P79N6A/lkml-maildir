The compile errors in 2.6.0-test4 were serio.
The boot-time errors in 2.6.0-test1 through test3, and then in test4 after I
changed the keyboard stuff back from "m" to "y", are that module serial is
not found.  These are not serio, but serial.  As far as I can tell, the
serial stuff other than keyboard and mouse are still modules, so I don't
know what is not being found.  Those messages scroll off the screen very
quickly during boot, and they don't get logged, so I can't report them
exactly.
One other message that I've seen during boot is that boot logging is
disabled because the console doesn't differ from the console.  I don't
exactly understand this one either, but it's sure telling the truth about
disabling boot logging.
