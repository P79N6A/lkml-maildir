 Andi,
   Thanks.  Then, I'll work it out in more detail and propose it on
linux-mm as you've suggested.
    Maybe I should also try to think of another example where it might be
useful.
    Anything that comes to  mind ?

I think it would be. You could propose it on the linux-mm mailing list and
ask Linus what he thinks.
I agree that it would be much nicer to do it this way.

It does not exist sorry. I was misremembering the lock hierarchy at that
place when I wrote the mail and should have double checked it.
