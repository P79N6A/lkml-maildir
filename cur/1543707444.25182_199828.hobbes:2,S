Hi all,
I get a kernel panic when doing this:
$ cdrecord dev=ATAPI -scanbus
I have uploded a screenshot here: 
http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ma1flfs/kpanic1.jpg
(BTW, is there any way to "scroll up" once a panic happens? I would love to 
see the beginning of this message.)
The above command works fine with 2.6.2; upgrading to 2.6.3 make this happen.
Note that I had this problem before - I got rid of it be compiling everything 
(a new Linux From Scratch) based on 2.6.2 and this project: 
http://ep09.pld-linux.org/~mmazur/glibc-kernel-headers/
It's obviously not a practical solution to make a new LFS system every time I 
want to upgrade my kernel.
Any ideas? Any addiitional info I should post?
Thanks in advance,
	Florian Schanda
