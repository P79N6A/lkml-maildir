For device files you really need to call into the device driver for this
(->flush etc).

The cheating is a bit messier than that - you might be revoking on a
cluster file system and I'm still trying to get my head around what the
semantics for that are. Lying about sizes will break the coherency
protocols I think
Serious question - do we actually need revoke() on a normal file ? BSD
has never had this, SYS5 has never had this.
