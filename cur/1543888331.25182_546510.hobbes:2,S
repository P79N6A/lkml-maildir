It might be a bug in the kernel code, however it is pretty unlikely: It just
reads what the CPU reports. You have an odd chip, nothing what the kernel
can do about. I see "family 15, model 2, stepping 4" usually beeing a P4
2.4GHz CPU. Maybe thats one of those relabling cases.
The information you list is a dual-cpu with HT configuration.
You could give us the output of any of your windows tools, but I am quite
sure they will report the same thing.
