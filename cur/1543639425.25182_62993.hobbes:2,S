This infact seems to be correct. After investigation it turns out that it is
lilo that baulks at anything bigger than 16MB of initrd (after
decompression). I have confirmed this using 2.2.20, 2.2.21, 2.4.7 and a few
printks to see if these images are actually getting the start_initrd value
passed. Anything bigger than 16MB and lilo will either:
a. Seem to complete the load but not pass the ramdisk_start value to the
kernel
or
b. Cold hang during the copy of the compressed image into memory
I've had a bit of a look at the lilo source but the assembly stuff is
meaningless to me. Can anyone please tell me if this is the intended
function of lilo (to be limited to a 16MB initrd?) or point me in the right
direction as to where I might start looking for this bug in the lilo source.
From what Mike says, below it would seem that this problem is not specific
to Lilo, but effects Loadlin aswell. I will try grub next.
Thanks,
Andrew.
