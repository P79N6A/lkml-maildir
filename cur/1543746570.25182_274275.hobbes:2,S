No.  Only evolution (2.0) exhibits the problem.  But, it looks like
evolution uses a comparable amount of CPU to a kernel build just
updating the message list.  All stracing it shows me is that it spends a
hell of a lot of time polling().  I think this might be a bloat issue.

No, I have plenty of RAM (512M).  I am using a 600Mhz C3 so the system
is probably CPU bound.  But, it seems like evolution should make a
little more progress.  I often find myself having to background all
build processes for a few seconds to let the message list render.  Once
the list renders, and I resume the builds, evolution is more or less
usable.  Running gtk-gnutella in the background will also make evolution
horribly slow.
Running the offending, CPU bound processes at a high nice value solves
the problem.  But now I am wasting half my fscking cycles "Updating
message list...".   Grr.
