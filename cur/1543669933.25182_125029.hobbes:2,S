It doesn't has to clash, but it only encourages waste. Encoding all kinds 
of information into dev_t has to plan for the worst case and that's the 
only reason to immediately go to 64 bits and most of the number space is 
simply unused and wasted.

Look at it this way: the whole range from 0 to ... is one big major 
number, so old device numbers show up their as well.
Only user space "knows" about the special from some of the bits, but the 
kernel certainly doesn't care.

Why should the kernel care about this? Most programs only want to open 
/dev/sd... Until the system tools are updated they will only see the old 
numbers anyway, later they won't care anymore either.
You didn't want that a device shows twice under devfs (e.g. as sda and 
scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0). How is that suddenly different?
