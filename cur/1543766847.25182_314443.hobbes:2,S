Yes.
The check is in the kernel, because otherwise it couldn't be enforced.
It is not there for the purpose of protecting user's data.  Rather for
protecting other users (including root) from unknowingly entering the
FUSE directory and thus leaking otherwise inaccessible information
(exact file operations performed) to the mount owner.
It's probably not a great security risk, but it's better to be safe
than sorry.  If a sysadmin decides, it's not problematic, he can
relax this by 
  echo user_allow_other >> /etc/fuse.conf
