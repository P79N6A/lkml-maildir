No.
When they have the same TGID, they _are_ the same thread group.
There is absolutely _zero_ correlation between thread ID and MM. Never has
been, never will be. An execve() is a total non-event from a TGID
perspective.
If you expect POSIX behaviour, you do not do execve's from the master.
It's that simple.
(Note that if you want POSIX behaviour, you're catching execve() anyway,
so the matter is moot).
