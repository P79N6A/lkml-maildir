Subject: [PATCH][i386] HPET setup, duplicate HPET_T0_CMP needed for some platforms
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch fixes the issue with HPET on some platforms.
According to Vojtech Pavlik:
The first write after writing TN_SETVAL to the config register sets the
counter value, the second write sets the threshold.
When you only do the first write you never set the threshold and
interrupts won't be generated properly.
Thanks to John Stultz and Andrew Walrond for reporting, root causing 
the issue and verifying this fix.
