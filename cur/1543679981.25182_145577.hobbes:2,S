Compilation breaks for me:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.21/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes 
 -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -fomit-frame-pointer 
 -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686 -DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS 
 -include /usr/src/linux-2.4.21/include/linux/modversions.h  -nostdinc 
 -iwithprefix include -DKBUILD_BASENAME=vicam  -c -o vicam.o vicam.c
vicam.c: In function `vicam_close':
vicam.c:767: parse error before `struct'
vicam.c:770: `cam' undeclared (first use in this function)
vicam.c:770: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
vicam.c:770: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [vicam.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.21/drivers/usb'
make[1]: *** [_modsubdir_usb] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.21/drivers'
make: *** [_mod_drivers] Error 2
Two patches are included that might be a cause, although it looks like
they were included to solve compilation problems:

I changed CONFIG_USB_VICAM from a module to no, because I don't need
the driver.
Have a nice weekend,
