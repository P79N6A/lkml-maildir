Hi.
Sorry for the slow response. Busy still.

I'm sure it could work, but I do worry a little about the possibilities
for exploits. It seems to me that if someone can get root, they an
insmod a module that could schedule any kind of work via any process.
Tracing that sort of security hole could be intractable. Christoph, is
that something you've considered/have thoughts on? Perhaps I'm just
being paranoid :>

We would still need some way to mark which threads to freeze, so we'd
still need the same sort of thing as far as kthread_run etc goes.
We'd also still mark unfreezable threads with NOFREEZE and not mark
other threads, so no change there.
The first substantial change I can see would be switching from
try_to_freeze to try_todo_list (could this be 'run_todo_list'? Try
implies failure is possible - if it is possible, why do we ignore
whether it fails?).
The second substantial change would be in the area of the refrigeration
code itself, ala Christoph's patch.
One more question regarding Christoph's patch - would it be worth moving
the refrigerator related code from sched.h to a separate file? We
already have so many things that depend on sched.h, and this will add
more. It will also make maintenance less painful because you won't have
to recompile everything that depends on sched.h when all you did was
modify (say) freezing().

Missed that one, sorry.

Thanks for the pointer.
