Can you suggest one? I honestly cannot think of a better one.
Its's a "entry" in the "direct" mapping.

It's a fairly standard widely used idiom for command line options because 
it allows default and forcing.  e.g. there can be cases when the kernel
disables it, but then it makes sense for the command line option
to override it. There is already one case in the kernel that 
disables it.

Ok, I can switch GART over to CPA, but that will make the patch
much more intrusive and a little riskier. Is that ok for you
and will it be still considered .25 candidate?
