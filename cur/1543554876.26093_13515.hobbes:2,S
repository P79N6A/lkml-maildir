Compiling as a module, the following throws a tantrum in my face:
make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux/fs/ntfs'
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686 -malign-functions=4  -DMODULE
-DNTFS_IN_LINUX_KERNEL -DNTFS_VERSION=\"000607\" -c -o inode.o inode.c
inode.c:1054: conflicting types for `new_inode'
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/fs.h:1153: previous declaration of
`new_inode'
make[2]: *** [inode.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/fs/ntfs'
and proceeds to die.. btw, this is for "make modules".. the kernel
built just fine (tho i haven't booted it yet)
i still suck at C, so this is only a guess (i'll find out if i'm right
or wrong i suppose ;) ), is that you can't static int without a
function prototype for it ... or a static inline can't be a static
int... well whatever the case, i look forward to seeing the fix [and
now it's time for sleep now that i am about to faceplant] ;)
