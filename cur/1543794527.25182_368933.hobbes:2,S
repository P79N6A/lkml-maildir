I have just realized that the "move apic init in init_IRQs" patches by
Eric were reverted back. Besides, APICs shutdown code made it back into
linux-2.6.15-rc2.
This is a desirable stopgap solution that will solve the problem for
some machines and configurations.
Anyway, up to now, the "LAPIC/IO-APIC save/restore" solution is the only
one that has worked reliably for us (even with badly broken BIOSes).
I will test Eric's patches and report the results.
Regards,
Fernando
