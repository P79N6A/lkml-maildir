I am able to reproduce the problem: all it needs are 3 linux boxes with 2.2
kernels and ipx enabled, one windows NT, and there is a netware 4.11 server 
as gateway (I can't try without it). There are also two other linuxes with 
2.0.* kernels, but I don't think they make a difference - I can't turn 
them off either.
Yesterday I mistakenly loaded ipx module into one of linuxes at the evening,
and the network traffic crashed the netware server during the night.
regards,
