Well I have pressed the various legal departments in Mt-Rainer, and as
long as we do not attempt to do non-native operations we should be clear.
Specifically legal, no license required :
	MRW device and MRW media read/write is cool
	MRW device format and create GAA, to create MRW from CDRW.
Specifically illegal, without a license agreement :
	CDRW reading MRW media.
	Building applications to stuff into the GAA to perform above.
These are key points, and the working group core has been blind cc'd.
