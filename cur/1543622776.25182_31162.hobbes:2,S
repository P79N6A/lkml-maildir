I think you'll find that a lot of people will frawn upon that practice, 
since most people are just interrested in getting support for as much 
hardware as possible, and usually considers it a good thing if one 
driver works with different hardware. But, it's your choise, and it 
would certainly be better than not releasing a driver at all if you ask 
me personally :)

 From my personal poing of view, having a Linux driver available in any 
form is a lot better than not having a Linux driver at all. Ofcourse a 
100% opensource driver (including firmware) would be the best and is (I 
think) the only thing that will have a chance of being included in the 
mainline kernel
Having Open Source driver and closed firmware is ofcourse not as good, 
but still a lot better for the users, since they can recompile the 
driver for different kernels. This is what NVidia does as far as I know. 
But you should probably expect to handle all support issues and 
bug-reports yourself, since if the full source is not available you'll 
be the only one who /can/ fix problems.
A completely closed source driver is in my personal oppinion only a good 
idea if the only other option is no driver at all. The Linux kernel is a 
fast moving target, and you'd have to release a new version of your 
driver everytime something in the kernel that affects your driver 
changes.  Since the users cannot even recompile it to match a new 
kernel. Ofcourse it's better than no driver, but consider the other 
options again.
Just my personal opinion ;)
