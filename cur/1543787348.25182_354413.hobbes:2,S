What I meant is that someone should describe why they are incorrect.
I could probably figure it out from the code, but in general the standards
for changelogs are higher than just "bla is wrong". It should be more like
"bla doesn't do X, so bad thing Y happens, which causes crash Z". Please 
follow this in future patches.
