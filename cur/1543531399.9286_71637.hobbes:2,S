Hi
	I have same problem. 2.3.<99 work with ppp 2.3.10 
As recommended in Documentation/Changes, I upgraded to ppp 2.3.11-14 (suse rpm)
for 2.3.99-pre .
pppd  fails to work with 2.3.99-pre x-y. 
pppd dials, then gets stuck at 'sent LCP ConfReq' messages waiting for ACK and
 then dies down. I am uptodate wrt. required tools (except modutils,but i 
insmod'd all needed stuff for ppp). 
Any pppd-2.3.11 success-stories with 2.3.99x-y ?
   regards,
