__GFP_ are the raw GFP flags ... the GFP_ are combinations of the flags
with predefined meanings.  There's no convention that you have to use
one form or the other when making combinations of the allocation flags.
Historically that's lead to things like
GFP_ATOMIC | __GFP_DMA (indicating additional DMA zone to the usual
atomic flags)
and
GFP_ATOMIC | GFP_DMA (indicating same thing, but with the defined flags)
You can argue that GFP_DMA has a pretty bogus GFP meaning and should
never appear on its own, which, to my mind makes the former usage
preferable.  However, GFP_DMA has been in linux since pretty much the
dawn of ISA drivers, so I think it's conventionally well understood.
