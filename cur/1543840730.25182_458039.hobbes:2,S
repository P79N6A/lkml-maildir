OK. This is the second system on which failure has happened. Can you
please send me the acpidump output (You can get latest pmtools from here
- 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
 ).
Unfortunately I am not able to reproduce this failure on my local
systems yet. I will try to find out what may be going wrong.
Andrew: Can you revert the below patch until the issue is resolved.
Thanks,
Venki
