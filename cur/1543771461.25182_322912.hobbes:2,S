Yes I like perl.

That is why i suggested seting R-T as
Reply-To: Real Name <linux-kernel@...>
Then one replies
To: Real Name <linux-kernel@...>
and it is even easier to find personal (that is how fidonet echos work
what mailing lists and usenet groups lack). For unsubscribers there is
Cc header and a rule that *we* shoud use "reply all" operation rather
than "reply".
1. No duplicate messages running through the net. [1]
2. Personal messages are easy distinguishible.
3. Unsubscribers can receive answers.
And what if R-T is completly removed from e-mails sent to the subscirbers?
[1] If you send a CCed message *you* send it several times to the server
and it is *your* connection which gets overloaded first.
Best regards.
