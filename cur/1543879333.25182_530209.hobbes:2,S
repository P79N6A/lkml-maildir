It's not worse than before for you CPU. The old code did 
#ifndef CONFIG_NUMA
        if (!cpu_khz || check_tsc_unstable())
#endif
                /* no locking but a rare wrong value is not a big deal */
                return (jiffies_64 - INITIAL_JIFFIES) * (1000000000 / HZ);
So if it worked before it still will.

With the fall back case changed back to jiffies sched_clock will be fully lockless.
