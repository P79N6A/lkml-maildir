Yes, but then you could be a bit more explicit to the compiler
on what you are doing here:
void *memchr(const void *s, int c, size_t n)
{
	const unsigned char *p = s;
	for (; n != 0; n--, p++) {
               if ((unsigned char)c == *p) {
                       return (void *)p;
	}
	return NULL;
}
Now the compiler should see the loop more clearly.
