I am having similar problems with -T1 and separately reported problems with
a build of rc3-mm1-S8 as well (no oops, but the USB mouse is dead).
Somewhere between those two versions (rc2-mm4-S7 and rc3-mm1-S8) is where
the problem appears to be introduced. For now I'll stay with my working -S0
kernel.
