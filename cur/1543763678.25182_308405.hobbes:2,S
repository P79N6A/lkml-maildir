I meant here, that user a-priori doesn't always know how good will his 
data be compressed. So, he *may* provide the output buffer of the same 
size as the input buffer (as you wrote, both are of 1GiB). So, if the 
input data *grows* after the compression, then crypto_comp_pcompress() 
will fill the output buffer fully and return OK, indicating that not all 
the input was compressed. And it is up to user to handle this situation. 
Probably he will just leave his data uncompressed. Probably he will 
provide more output buffers. I just wanted to say, that 
crypto_comp_pcompress() will work OK even in the case of uncompressible 
data because I thought something worries you in this case :-)
