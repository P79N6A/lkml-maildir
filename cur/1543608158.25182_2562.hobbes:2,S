You could do that even today (without slab task_struct) by using a 
random/coloured at fork time value for esp0.  This could just be a static
colour counter that is subtracted.
Just don't forget to teach ptrace and proc WCHAN and oops printing about it; 
they currently use hardcoded stack offsets. It'll also likely break kdb.
