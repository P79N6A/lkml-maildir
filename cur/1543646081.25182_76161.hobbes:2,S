Hello!
> Are we absolutely sure no applications use this?
To my shame I have to recognize: my local inetd/sendmail/ftpd still use it,
despite of all my many years snivels that it is mad-broken-crap-... :-)
Though, nothing to shame of, actually. IPV6_ADDRFORM was mad,
but IPv4 mapped addresses are mad^3. So, until IPV6_V6ONLY becomes usable,
port spaces are shared and the only way to write sane dual-protocol code
is IPV6_ADDRFORM.
:-) This is not objection against removal. Let it happen simultaneously
with IPV6_V6ONLY.
