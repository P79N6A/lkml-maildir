The bootloader knows how to dodge the low memory and EBDA. This is true since
Lilo.21. Having the tables in the EBDA is actually fairly uncommon but does
occur on some boards. 
Almost every board that puts the specification in ROM is broken and breaks
the requirement that the table be correct for the machine configuration -
they report 2 cpus when there is 1 cpu on a dual board.

The MP floating pointer structure must be in one of those three areas. The
specification suggests that the MP table itself should only be in the EBDA, 
or last 1K if no EBDA or in the BIOS 0xE0000->xFFFFF area.
Its all a bit silly since you can put the MP table at the address the bios
will load the boot block and still be compliant 8)

The PCI routing table can also be in high memory as can the PCI BIOS. 
Compaq did that for a while then after discovering every OS had at least bugs
if you did this put it somewhere sensible. 2.2 doesnt use the PCI routing
table but does blow up if your PCI bios is high and we are favouring PCI
bios calls.
