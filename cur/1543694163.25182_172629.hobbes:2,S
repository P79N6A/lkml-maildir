Seems you were using a kernel definition of a function (this 
normally happens only because it was out there by mistake,
or because you had __KERNEL__ #defined).
It will be in include/asm/atomic.h; however, it is not wise to
use directly the kernel stuff unless you are coding kernel stuff.
You can always strip them, of course :)
