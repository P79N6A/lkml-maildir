True but then this variable is not frequently read. So false sharing would 
not have much of an impact.

In that case I would think we would want to place these very hot 
spots in their own cacheline and control which variables end up in 
that particular cacheline. Define a struct something {} and put all 
elements that need to go into the same cacheline into that struct. 
Then cacheline align the struct.
