And tar?

I do not see how this matters. cowlinks are already non-POSIX. If
is_hardlinked() always returns 1, but is_cowlinked() sometimes returns
something else, you are still "as much POSIX as possible".

Well, if only block 17 is cowlink-shared between two files, I guess
userspace does not want to know... And I think that cow-inode number
*can* handle all other cases.
Oh, get_cow_inode() should really be allowed to fail in some usefull
way, so that filesystems do not have to implement it if its hard for
them.

Yes.
