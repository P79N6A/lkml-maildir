   Yes.
   There is a known problem with Seagate's SATA drives and the SiI
3112 controller that is used on the Adaptec 1210SA. The difficulty is
that certain [common] transfer sizes have to be split up into two
transfers in order to avoid triggering the erratum (which hangs the
machine, IIRC). This drops performance drastically. There is currently
no solution to the low performance of the Seagate/SiI combination.
   Hugo.
