Can you do a swapoff -a and then a swapon -a? The swap cache should be
garbage collected that way.
My 
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/arca-tree/2.2.0_arca-6.gz
 avoid the orphaned
swap cache entried to stay alive when they can' be anymore useful (so you
don't need to swapoff -a to force them to go away). This has the advantage
of decreasing the fragmentation on the swap space.
