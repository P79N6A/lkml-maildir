Subject: [RFC][2.5] generic_usercopy() function

Hello all,
especially the Video4Linux-driver rely intensively on the 
video_usercopy() function, which handles the copying of userspace 
arguments of ioctls with a simply callback mechanism.
Recently the dvb-core has been added which needs the same function. 
Because of the fact that the core is independent of Video4Linux, the 
code was duplicated to a dvb_usercopy() function.
In order to prevent this code duplication, introducing a 
generic_usercopy() function to lib/ is one possibilty.
The appended 4 patches do the following:
01-introduce.diff:
- remove video_usercopy() from videodev.c
- add generic_usercopy() to "lib/usecopy.c" and update the build system
02-video.diff:
- change all users of video_usercopy() to use generic_usercopy() instead
03-radio.diff:
- change all users of video_usercopy() to use generic_usercopy() instead
04-dvb.diff
- remove dvb_usercopy() from the dvb core and fix it to use 
generic_usercopy() instead.
The diffs are against 2.5.69.
Comments are very appreciated. 8-)
Is there a possibility to get this into the kernel?
CU
Michael.
