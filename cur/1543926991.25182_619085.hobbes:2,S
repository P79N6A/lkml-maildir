My concern is that you stated earlier that you needed to do the second 
skb_peek() because the first skb may have been removed from the socket queue 
while your LSM was making an access decision in 
security_post_recv_datagram().  If that is the case then the second call to 
skb_peek() will return a different skb then the one you passed to 
security_post_recv_datagram().  This is significant because you always throw 
away this second skb without first consulting the LSM via 
security_post_recv_datagram().
