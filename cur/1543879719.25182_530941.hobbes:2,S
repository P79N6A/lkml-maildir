Me too. Thanks for your patience. We'll track this down. A german
proverb is "Mühsam ernährt sich das Eichhörnchen" which means we're
collecting our pieces (literally food), but very slowly and hard.

That would require recompiling a production kernel, but I've now
backgrounded usbmon spamming my disk, with just the keyboard attached to
the external USB2.0 hub (the other device would have been my Eizo
FlexScan L768 19" TFT) in the hope that it will come up with something,
should khubd hang again before Friday...
