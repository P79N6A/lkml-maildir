Subject: [PATCH/RFC] remove frv usage of flush_tlb_pgtables()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

frv is the last user in the tree of that dubious hook, and it's my
understanding that it's not even needed. It's only called by memory.c
free_pgd_range() which is always called within an mmu_gather, and
tlb_flush() on frv will do a flush_tlb_mm(), which from my reading
of the code, seems to do what flush_tlb_ptables() does, which is
to clear the cached PGE.

Hi David ! I want to get rid of flush_tlb_pgtables() as part of my
work on the mmu_gather and frv seems to be the only one to still use it.
I don't think it needs it though, can you double check ?
Thanks !
Ben.
