Here is the latest set of kprobes patches for 2.5.44. It is essentially 
same as the last one I sent out for 2.5.40. On top of that, I am sending
additional patches to get kprobes closer to dprobes full version.
0/1 - this
1/1 - kprobes - base - same as the one Rusty has been sending, just
                upgraded to 2.5.44.
2/1 - kprobes - debug register management
3/1 - kprobes - kwatch points
4/1 - kprobes - user space probes
Any comments, especially about the addon patches welcome.
