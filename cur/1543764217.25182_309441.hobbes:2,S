Sorry that's what I meant, you are adding a lock inside the queue. I
didn't mean removing q->queue_lock or making it a non-pointer.

It is simpler, but it only solves this particular problem of the lock
going away.

But you are tying it completely to the SCSI problem, since we have no
locking problems of this sort elsewhere. At least the notified could
potentially be used for something else. The lock is just hack number two
to work around the problem.
