Hi!
I think i'm getting really bad values from my disks. It's two Western
Digital WD800JB-00DUA3 (Special Edition 8 MB cache) disks connected to a
Promise TX2000 (PDC20271) card (RAID1 using ataraid under Linux 2.4.23).
The disks are setup with hdparm at boot time:
/sbin/hdparm -X69 -d1 -u1 -m16 -c3 /dev/hda 
/sbin/hdparm -X69 -d1 -u1 -m16 -c3 /dev/hdc
When running hdparm -tT I get the following:
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.13 seconds =113.27 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.46 seconds = 26.02 MB/sec
/dev/hdc:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.13 seconds =113.27 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.47 seconds = 25.91 MB/sec
Are these normal values? I don't think so. Please advise.
/Nicke
