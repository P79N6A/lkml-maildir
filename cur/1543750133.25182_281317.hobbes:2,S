actually, the bk lease server could give out id's and those could be
caches in ~/.bk<whatever> --- server side it could be a counter that
you just xor with some s3kr1t value and then blind using a hash or
cryto-function, something good-enough (statistically unlikely to
break) is all that is required, it doesn't have to be perfect surely?
