Hello,
Linux kernel does not have "full" thread support ? Could you be more precise ?
What do you think could be possible let's say like this:
process 1
	|_____ thread 1
	|_____ thread 2
and if you "ps auxm" you must see this tree on ps ?
I am waiting from you more details about how-to /proc for Solaris to add
support in Linux.
Rgds,
Stef
