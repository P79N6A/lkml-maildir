As another sysadmin with 300+ linux and solaris boxes, I second
you sentiments exactly.  As my previous post today states, I am
having exactly the problem you describe with automount daemons
becoming hung or unresponsive.  Guess I should give 4.1.0 a try.  
Of course the same arguement applies to NFS server but they went
ahead and moved most of that into the kernel anyway for the 
performance gain.
