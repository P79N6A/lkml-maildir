Let's see. If there is flag based fix and we make the old behavior default
we will trick many new users into using the old broken IV metric. If we make
the new metric default the user can't mount his old images. 
As there is no autodetection for default behavior, there will be no way to
avoid the pain. Well, almost. We could allocate a new major for a different
metric, and create  /dev/loop-ng*. That'd be feasible, but actually just a
pain transfer .. from the user to the developer :)

No please, I don't wanna patch my kernel for another 2 years. Andrew Morton
is right when he puts this issue on his must-fix list.
