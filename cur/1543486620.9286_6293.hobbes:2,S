Since the ip command kit has no installation procedure and no usage
documentation, there are no such symlinks on my system.  How would I have
known to do this?  Was any of this announced anywhere?  Did I accidentally
sleep through November and miss it all?
I'm starting to understand what happened, but I feel like I've been
eavesdropping on a private conversation.  I don't recall any discussion of
breaking the more-or-less standard tools and providing an incompatible
replacement, or of making incompatible changes to the kernel.  It may all
be fine work, but lots of us never heard about it.  I'm particularly
worried that so many of the "usual suspects" on Linux-Kernel never caught
wind of these significant changes to the kernel.  Who should be getting
the word out, and how can we encourage him to do so?
