It may not be perverted. What if you have a script that has the option of
excluding a certain command from running (think of the weird stuff in
autoconf) so you use
$(COMMAND) "$@"
a lot in your script and COMMAND="/usr/bin/frob" but if /etc/nofrob exists
you set COMMAND="/bin/true" which effectively turns off $(COMMAND) without
the need for a if/fi block around EVERY call to it and it always succeeds.
Unless someone puts --version into the command line (which may not get
sucked up by your script if the "$@" was a $3 instead!
To me, that doesn't sound like a very perverted situation, but that may say
something about me :-)
