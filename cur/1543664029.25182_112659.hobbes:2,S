I am seeing a strange keyboard related issue as well on a Thinkpad A20M. It seems if I walk away for say, 20 minutes, come back and try to input a password to KDE's screen saver, the FIRST keystroke I make is not recognized at all. All keystrokes after the first one register perfectly fine. This is on the laptop's built-in keyboard. I too am using ACPI. If I don't wait long enough it doesn't happen, so I do believe it has something to do with power management. I first noticed it in 2.5.61(first 2.5 kernel that would boot for me) and am currently running 2.5.63, where I still see it. I am not using modules.
If anyone would like more info on this, please let me know.
