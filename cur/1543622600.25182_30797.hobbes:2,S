I had previously suggested to Mike (but he seems to have missed it) that
you should _always_ move files to the undelete area, regardless of how
many links there are.  This avoids all of the races, doesn't increase
space usage at all (because the undelete area is always in the same fs),
and is actually better for the users (because "rm <file>", "unrm <file>"
will always work even if <file> has multiple links).
Cheers, Andreas
