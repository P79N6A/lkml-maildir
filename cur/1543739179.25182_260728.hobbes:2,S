I cannot explain this case, but I can at least explain all KMAIL tab/space 
mangles. The current qt 3.3.3 version has a bug which is fixed in the 
current qt snapshot. 
Every kmail user should be aware of that 
see 
http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90688
for further details.
There is another problem that "cat diff-file + X copy and paste" does 
convert all tabs as well. 
cheers
Christian
