Here's a real-life example of how well it works.  I tend to bounce back and
forth between Linus' -pre patches and your -ac patches.  For instance, when
2.4.4-ac4 came out, I was running 2.4.5-pre1.  Here's what I did:
zcat patch-2.4.5-pre1.gz | patch -p1 -s -E -R
zcat patch-2.4.4-ac4.gz | patch -p1 -s -E
mv .config ..
make mrproper
mv ../.config .
make oldconfig
make dep && make bzlilo modules modules_install
I apply nearly every patch set that comes along from you or Linus, and this is
the way I usually do it.  Every once in a while, I run through all the options
in menuconfig just to make certain nothing has gotten hosed up.  Only once can I
remember needing to change an option that had been set incorrectly by oldconfig.
