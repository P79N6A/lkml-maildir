I added this as well:
static inline char *format_dev_t(char *buffer, dev_t dev)
{
	sprintf(buffer, "%04lx\n", (unsigned long)dev);
	return buffer;
}
tp be placed direct in a printk().
We'll probably need to do something more fancy in here later, because once
a dev_t becomes 32:32, it'll need to be printed out with "%016llx", which
is daft.
So we'll need to come up with some standardised way of presenting a dev_t
to the user.  Presumably that will just be
	sprintf(buf, "%d:%d", major(dev), minor(dev));
	
But if we do this, will it break your existing stuff?

Seems OK.  Every kdev_t.h includer now needs to include kernel.h too.  Fair
enough.
