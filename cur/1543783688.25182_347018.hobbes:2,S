I dont understand that? Can you point out where I am confused?
Loading a non-GPL (tagged) module leads in tainting the kernel (which basically
is a flag for developers to be alerted while debugging), is that right?
Non GPL Modules are also restrited in the number of symbols they can use,
this is to make it harder to derive work from the Linux Kernel with a ABI
interface.
