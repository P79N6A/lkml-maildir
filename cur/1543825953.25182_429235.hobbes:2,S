Looking at the Kconfig help text, it looks to me like SCSI_SRP without
SCSI_TGT makes no sense. I guess at some point I must have been
thinking "I have no idea what SCSI RDMA Protocol is, so I'll build it
as a module just to be safe" -- I somehow missed the word "target" in
its Kconfig help text when I enabled it...
