As my disclaimer said, this has only been tested using
the NUMA EMULATION config option.  That's a big part of
the reason for sending this out  - to get further testing 
on real x86-64 NUMA systems, but without breaking the
current discontigmem code.  
I expect to be able to test this on at least one AMD system
at the local University systems lab, but haven't had a
chance to do so yet.
