Sound may be a standard feature, but it does not get driven by a
standard interface like PS2 or HID keyboards do. It's also not as
straight forward as "sound or no sound". There's many different levels
of sound hardware, from the 2-channel basic stereo, to the 6-way Dolby
Digital 5.1.
Whether or not a line is needed in an rc script is really a shortcoming
of userspace, IMO. It's the responsibility of userspace to setup the
user's environment in the most friendly way.
