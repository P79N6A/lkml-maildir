I think it would be very helpful - as much for accounting as for
protecting ourselves against malicious tasks. (by the way I have another
example of a task that behaves very badly - on one of my computers, the
mtv mpeg movie player sometimes makes the system really crawl. I'm not
sure exactly why, but it could be related to it using just under one
timeslice to decompress a video frame....)
I didnt know that we used the tsc counter for scheduling, though.

Did you realize you can have that much fun for a code merge ?
