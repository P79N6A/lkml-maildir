aha, I hate sysctl tables too, now. So, you meant
/proc/driver/<drivername> like it is done, e.g. by rtc. I see, so all
you want is just a simple /proc/driver/microcode file which supports a
single ioctl and not an entry in kernel/sysctl.c to be fiddled by
sysctl(2) system call. I misunderstood you.
Ok, I will come back with implementation when it is ready.

Tigran.
PS. It was a good idea to read email before coding - I almost started
fiddling with ctl_table stuff :)
