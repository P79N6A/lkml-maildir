Interesting.  When this patch was originally proposed a couple of years ago, we
did this instead:
  
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=daef265f1590cf3e6de989d074041a280c82d58b;hp=00d6da9b4d6707b808481372537adb0fb38f99b3
) DM doesn't need to bounce bio's on its own, but the block layer defaults
) to that in blk_queue_make_request(). The lower level drivers should
) bounce ios themselves, that is what they need to do if not layered below
) dm anyways.
