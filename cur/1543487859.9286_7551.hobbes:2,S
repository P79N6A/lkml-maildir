This is another reason why it _must_ be changed. You can't support four
ports (sparc, aparc64, alpha, mips) because they don't have SIGUNUSED.
Removal of SIGUNUSED and SIGSTKFLT would reduce the temptation to
produce software that only works on half of the Linux ports.
If there is a need for more signals (I'd say yes), then SIGRTMIN
and SIGRTMAX should be adjusted. Normal UNIX systems do this.
They reserve about half of the high 32 signals for the OS.
