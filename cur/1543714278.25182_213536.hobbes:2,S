where would you like to see such warnings? arguably, all of the dangerous conditions should be handled by this core code to avoid problems (such as only using the first 4 pat entries, flushing the correct caches when updating the pat entries or pte bits). these problems really aren't all that different than any other cache aliasing/pte flushing issues that always exist, right?

absolutely. I tried to handle this by initializing the pat entries as each cpu comes online at boot time, with cache flushes. I think Andi mentioned flushing the TLBs as well, I'll check up on that to make sure I'm doing that as well.

certainly, that is more or less what this mechanism is intended to prevent. cmap_compare_cachings is an arch-dependent function, which allows architectures to allow/disallow different cache attributes. I certainly consider the current implementation to be a sample that needs some tweaking. for example, I forgot that I had allowed CACHED/NOCACHED overlaps, due to MTRRs that legally overlap like this. but that's probably not a situation we want for any other case, so I need to fix that.
Thanks,
Terence
