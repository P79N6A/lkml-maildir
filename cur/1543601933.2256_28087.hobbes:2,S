Still no luck with this slightly tweaked kernel config.
Here are the relevant config variables ("grep '=y' .config", copy lines
from CONFIG_IDE to CONFIG_SCSI):
  CONFIG_IDE=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK=y
  CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI=y
  CONFIG_IDEPCI_SHARE_IRQ=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ADMA=y
  CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX=y
  CONFIG_PDC202XX_BURST=y
  CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX=y
  CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_MODES=y
Is there any point in upgrading to a kernel beyond 2.4.9?  Or has the
relevant code not been touched lately?
