cpmp is a physical address on arch/ppc?
/me looks at arch/ppc/8xx_io/commproc.c
Yikes.  Please don't change cpm_uart_cpm1.h, as it's correct for 
arch/powerpc, and there are numerous other places that assume cpmp is 
virtual (including in the very same function that assigns it a physical 
address).
You could fix arch/ppc if you want, though it may be easier to wait for 
it to die, and insist on identity maps in the meantime. :-)
