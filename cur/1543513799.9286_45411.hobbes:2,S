2.3.23 hangs immediately after uncompressing the kernel on my old
K6/200. 
The same kernel boots on my PII.
The important CONFIG's:
CONFIG_M586TSC
CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM=y
CONFIG_MTRR=y
CONFIG_SMP=y
cpu capabilities from "cat /proc/cpuinfo"
fpu vma de pse tsc msr mce cx8 sep mmx.
compiler: egcs-1.12
2.3.22 booted without any problems.
If you need more details, please ask,
