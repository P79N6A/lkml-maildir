This probably doesn't scale well enough. You will allways have files
bigger than your (free) memory. And you will have writes of huge 
documents only to append a few bytes. (Look at mail readers)

What about a new kernel feature, touching all abstraction levels from
fs implementation to user space API :-) :  
Files that can grow (or shrink) in the middle. 
Then, at application level, we can have a file that contains of several
data streams, and we only have to care about the starting points (and
sizes) of the streams - or whatever the application wants to store.
And we still have a single stream file as a whole, that can be moved
around by existing tools. And we can access this file on systems that
do not support this scheme (but only with more application code and
less performance)
I have some ideas how to implement this scheme, but they are rather
long and probably not complete. If you don't like this scheme at all,
you can stop reading here :-)
The only way to support this I can currently imagine is some kind
of allocation list per file.
In this scheme, on the lowest level, a file is still a stream of bytes.
But it has some kind of header saying (for example): 
'Of this 10240 bytes long file, use only bytes 0-3999 and 5000-10000'.
When I write to the end of this file (that is, at file position 9200)
this changes to
'Of this 10240 bytes long file, use only bytes 0-3999 and 5000-10200'.
and finally
'Of this 11264 bytes long file, use only bytes 0-3999 and 5000-10300'.
That's easy. When I insert bytes after the 'hole' at 3999 it changes to:
'Of this 11264 bytes long file, use only bytes 0-4299 and 5000-10300'.
and finally combines to:
'Of this 11264 bytes long file, use only bytes 0-10300'.
The difficult part is inserting at a position where no hole is available.
But this can be done with the following steps: Imagine, we want to
insert at position 1000. (That is not at a block boundary. For simplicity,
I assume block boundaries at 1024 bytes)
First, we insert an unused block at 1024, and our usage pattern changes to:
'Of this 12280 bytes long file, use only bytes 0-1023, 2048-10300'.
This doesn't change the files contents, and doesn't need any copying.
But we still cannot insert at 1000. So we have to move some bytes (but
allways less than one allocation unit) and write:
'Of this 12280 bytes long file, use only bytes 0-999, 2024-10300'.
Now we have a hole at 1000 that we can fill like above.
That's it. Comments?
Bye, Jan
