It depends on what you fsync() :-).
On BSD, fsync() of a file's descriptor will commit the rename of that
file to disk.
On Linux, fsync() of the *directory's* descriptor is required.  And
yes, this will work across file systems and Linux versions, according
to Linus/Alan/etc.

But it is necessary.  See below.

This is not sufficient!  Data writes are NOT guaranteed to be ordered.
It is permissible for the file system to flush the first and last
block of a file to disk BEFORE flushing the middle.  You either need
the double fsync() or you need a checksum in the file; simple markers
are not enough to make a real guarantee.  And MTAs should be making
real guarantees!

No, data=ordered has nothing to do with recreating dead files.  What
data=ordered does is make sure bogus blocks do not appear in new files
(or in new extents of old files).
Failing to call fsync() at all (i.e., failing to commit metadata
updates) is what can recreate dead files.

No, it is lost, because the file's creation is not guaranteed to have
happened at all!  (Well, depending on the file system and the
semantics.  I think I need to write this up more clearly.)

As I said, the issue is what descriptors they should call fsync() on.
On Linux, fsync() on a file's descriptor will commit the file's
contents; a second fsync() on the containing directory's descriptor
will commit the rename()/link().
