Okay I have done some more research and found out what is happening!
After further testing I have found out that the problem with the parport driver
is actually in the ieee1294 code.   One of the changes in the file
drivers/parport/ieee1294_ops.c is causing problems.  (for me atleast)
The code has changed from calls to parport_frob_control() to calls to
parport_write_control ().(Fine)
The problem is that in the call to acknowledge the handshake (Event 44? about
line592) the call to parport_frob_control or parport_pc_frob_control as it is
#defined to is called with a 0 which I think causes the code to call
parport_pc_data_forward and the new code just calls parport_pc_data_reverse.
I think that we may need to call the parport_pc_data_forward still.
-               parport_write_control (port, ctl);   // new code
+               parport_frob_control (port, PARPORT_CONTROL_AUTOFD, 0);  //old
working code
