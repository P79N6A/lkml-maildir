Subject: [patch] fixed block_dev fs corruption 2.2.14pre14 (and 2.2.*)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I fixed two bugs that leads to fs corruption in the block_dev layer:
o	it was writing on a buffer without waiting read I/O completation
	(like ext2)
o	it wasn't checking the read for the partial-write case
	made the buffer uptodate before continuing
The fix is been tested heavily and it's been reported to me to fix the
reproducible fs corruption. Please include it in the future 2.2.14 (or let
me know).
