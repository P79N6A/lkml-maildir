Linus orginally wrote it. It has been modified but it really hasn't
changed much. When 2.5.X comes out this will change. Several people will
be working on the new console system.

Use the framebuffer console. It allows for such things. As for the issue
of VT switching this works but a better way to handle this is being worked
