Never.  They don't support development kernels, so the next kernel they will 
support aside from 2.4 will be 2.6.  I suggest you do as I have done: write 
nVidia asking them to release their drivers under the GPL and get them 
integrated into the kernel tree.  If that doesn't suit you, you can always 
try to use previous patches and fix up the driver to work in 2.5.
Cheers,
Nicholas
