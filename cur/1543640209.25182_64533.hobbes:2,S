Tom, I'm working on a set of patches that completely change this
interface because there are a bunch of problems with the current
entropy accounting.
What PPC and other arches really need in this area is a higher
resolution timing source. The jiffies-based timing is rather
limiting, especially after the entropy accounting stops overestimating
things by orders of magnitude. Does the PPC port have a convenient way
to access the TBR or something similar?
