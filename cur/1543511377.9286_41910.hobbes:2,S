FibreChannel + 4K device access, WOOHOO!!!!!!!!!!!!
As soon as I get a new toy from an unnamed company, Linux may have a
screamer of FC with access to 4K of devices.  The proposed stock kernel
driver will grant 256 devices; however, the product uses some trade secret
to get 4K of devices.  Once introduced, it is projected that the extended
API for the 4K device access code should be GPLed 12 to 18 months after
kernel introduction.
If you have an interest in this kind of support and goodies, send me a
blurb and I will forward it to the vender to try and get things into fast
forward say 2.4 kernel........very long shot.....but I have a dead eye.
