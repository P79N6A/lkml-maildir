I wasn't responding to you. You're article just happened to be the one

Again, I'm perhaps naive here - I've never been able to afford such a
machine with hot-pluggable CPU's, however, I have heard from people who
have used them at work, that you use software (i.e. system calls to the
kernel) to instruct the kernel to no longer schedule tasks for the CPU.
Once the CPU is no longer scheduled for use, you can feel free to unplug
the CPU from the motherboard. Note that I didn't say that the software
approach could *guarantee* immediate success. You wouldn't unplug the
CPU until your had successfully deregistered the CPU from having anything
scheduled for it.
Is this not the way things (should) work?
