Sorry. I will document stuff better next time.

We can do that. Just that the freezer will now have to wait for 2 sets
of ack's instead of 1 set before declaring the system as frozen.
But the whole point of the patch was so that a thread A can tell
a thread B that it's dependent on the latter, and hence would like
to postpone B's freezing for some time. So I am thinking if we can
achieve this through the scheme you described.

Well, even then we'll need to ensure that a thread would not call
kthread_stop_freezeable() with any locks held. That would mean more
audits :)

Sure, am already thinking about it :)

Ok, will change it to __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED(freezer_status.lock)
