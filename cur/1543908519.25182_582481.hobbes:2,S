Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.23-rc2 error compiling fs/drop_caches.c (struct super_block errors)

I'm getting a lot of warnings about struct super_block in 2.6.23-rc2.  Then,
a compile error when compiling fs/drop_caches.o:
  CC      fs/drop_caches.o
In file included from fs/drop_caches.c:7:
include/linux/mm.h:1210: warning: 'struct super_block' declared inside parameter list
include/linux/mm.h:1210: warning: its scope is only this definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want
fs/drop_caches.c:17: error: conflicting types for 'drop_pagecache_sb'
include/linux/mm.h:1210: error: previous declaration of 'drop_pagecache_sb' was here
fs/drop_caches.c:28: error: conflicting types for 'drop_pagecache_sb'
include/linux/mm.h:1210: error: previous declaration of 'drop_pagecache_sb' was here
make[1]: *** [fs/drop_caches.o] Error 1
make: *** [fs] Error 2
I'm using Linus's tree, which is 2.6.23-rc2 plus all patches up to this

I didn't check if this is fixed already in the latest -mm.  The following
small fix seems to get rid of all warnings and compile errors I've seen:
diff --git a/include/linux/mm.h b/include/linux/mm.h
index 324c151..ed90191 100644

 #ifndef CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM          /* Don't use mapnrs, do it properly */
 extern unsigned long max_mapnr;
Cheers,
Erez.
