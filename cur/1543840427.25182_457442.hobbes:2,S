This could easily block hotplug forever though, if you have lots of
tasks in the system.

Well you would just have a depth count in the task_struct... in fact that
could *be* the read lock (ie. writer traverses all tasks instead of all
CPU locks), and would save a cacheline in the read path...
But I think the point was that we didn't want to add yet another field
to task_struct. Maybe it is acceptable... one day it will be like
page_flags though ;)
