"APIC" here means I/O-APIC. The local APIC is Ok according to the dmesg log.

This part is fine.

But here the .config ends, so we can't tell if ACPI is enabled or not.

The kernel found no MP tables. The only chance left to enable the
I/O-APIC is for you to configure ACPI and pray it works on your machine.
