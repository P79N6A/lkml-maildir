Doesn't objective C essentially require a runtime to provide a lot of
the features of the language?  If it does (as I suspect) then it is
totally unsiatable for kernel development.
That and object oriented languages in general are badly designed and a
bad idea.  Having not used objective C I have no idea if it qualifies as
badly designed or not.  Certainly C++ and java are both very badly
designed.
Besides the kernel does a wonderful job doing object oriented design
where apropriate using C without any of the stupidities added by the
common OO languages.
