Looking at how other netdevice drivers:
8139too and others checks netif_running() in interrupt handler.
r8169 has scary "50k$" question comment re irqs disabled after
interacting with hardware.
But the r8169 case should be fixed by atlx_irq_disable()?
Writes to REG_IMR, REG_ISR are commented in atl1_reset_hw(), why?
(I'll test that soon)
Do we have a theory why changing from 64-bit DMA mask to 32-bit mask
resurrects the bug? NIC here never showed any sort of corruption
described in commit which banned 64-bit DMA.
