Ok, I looked at it (drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_mbx.c) 
and the solution seems simple:
- Introduce an busy flag, check that BEFORE this mutex_lock()
  and don't protect it by that mutex.
- return -EBUSY to the  upper layers, if mailbox still busy
- upper layers can either queue the command or use a retry mechanism
There are many examples for this in the kernel. NICs have the same problems
(transmitter busy or stuck) and have no problem handling that gracefully
since ages.

That doesn't depend on time, just whether you get the right idea or not.
Anyway I CCed the current maintainers.
So my point still stands: Timeout based locking is evil and hides bugs.
In this case the bugs are: 
1. That mutex protects a code path (mailbox command submission 
    and retrieve) instead of data.
2. "Mailbox is free" is an event, so you should use wait_event_timout() 
    for that
