(Resend, due to HTML version previously)
But what is calling stop_machine in that path?
There *is* a race, but I don't think it could cause this (we should make a
copy of active.fnret inside the lock before returning it).
Two patches: one fixes that race, the next adds debugging spew.
stop_machine: fix race with return value
We should not access active.fnret outside the lock; in theory the next
stop_machine could overwrite it.
