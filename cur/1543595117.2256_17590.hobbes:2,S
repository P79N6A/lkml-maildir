Hah! Yeah, you're right; both times it happened because mozilla was
running at the time. I can't have it untarred on the client because the
client isn't on every day. It's a minor nuisance now that I've understood

Is there a fix in the works for this?

Possible typo. I did the diff on the server so perhaps I gave the
impression the problem was there, and it wasn't.
Take care,
