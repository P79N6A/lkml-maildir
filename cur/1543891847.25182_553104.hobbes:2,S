Just use "rmdir /containers/1" here.

As far as I could see, Pavel's problem wasn't actually an Oops, it was
a WARN_ON() when allocating a zero length chunk of memory. There's
ongoing discussion as to whether this counts as a problem with the
allocators or the kmalloc() code, since it used to be OK to allocate a
zero-length chunk.
