The data is transmitted here by the bus in 32 bit little endian blocks
but makes sense in le16 bit lumps. Off is 1 and on is 0 - hence the ~
The first 16 bits are the button data the next 16 bits are the (start
of) the axis data. Both cpu and bus data (in this case - it can vary)
are little endian.
