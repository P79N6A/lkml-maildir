If you're going to go beyond the simple owner access model it
probably makes sense to go all out, swipe the file system ACL
code and provide the whole nine yards of users, groups, and modes.
The only system that I know of that had socket ACLs was the 4.X
version of Trusted Irix, and socket ACLs were dropped in 5.0 because
they were unpopular.
If you're daring you could propose that low number ports be treated
the same way as other ports, with the default ownership being root and
the default ACL allowing only root.

Putting access control on ports rather than sockets is a novel
approach. It is a lot simpler underneath and more consistant with
the way other object name spaces are treated.
