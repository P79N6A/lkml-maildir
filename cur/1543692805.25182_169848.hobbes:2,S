Sorry if I hadn't been clear enough on that part...
"Quite some time ago" I upgraded (from 2.4.18) to 2.5.62...
"Since that time", I hadn't updated kernel versions - I did the
update to 2.5.x only for better USB-palmsync support.
*Yesterday* I fetched the latest kernel (2.6.0-test6) and tried
that one - and THAT one is causing the problems...
I hope it's clearer now...
