Subject: [PATCH 43/51] [DLM] Make dlm_sendd cond_resched more
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/4/137

From: Patrick Caulfield <pcaulfie@redhat.com>
Under high recovery loads dlm_sendd can monopolise the CPU and cause soft lockups.
This one extra and one moved cond_resched() make it yield a little more during
such times keeping work moving.
