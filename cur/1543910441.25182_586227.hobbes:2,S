These patches come from Pavel. They add to readability since
limit is unsigned long.

We had a WARN_ON(1) before, but we changed it in v2 or v3 based on review
comments from Dave. I think WARN_ON(cond) is more readable than
WARN_ON(1) for the same reason as BUG_ON(cond) vs BUG_ON(1)

I agree with you in part, but the size of user input is not fixed.
Setting a fixed limit seems artificial, I'll see how this can be improved.
