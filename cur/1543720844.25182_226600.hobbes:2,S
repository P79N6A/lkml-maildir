To the benefit of developers, here are the tracebacks for today. I 
haven't experienced any lockups so far, BUT i have experienced two weird 
experiences:
1) The space key seemed to get stuck and it unstock by pressing <backspace>
2) The 'n' key stuck and unstuck itself, displaying about 5 'n' on my 
screen.
For both events I have an identified backtrace from 'dmesg' (thanks, to 
the traceback code in atkbd.c). There is another event there in the logs 
where I didn't notice in the keyboard.
As someone in this thread expressed earlier, it seems that the driver is 
requesting a keyboard reconnect. This shouldn't be hapenning, right?
Here are the traces with their desrcibing title:
