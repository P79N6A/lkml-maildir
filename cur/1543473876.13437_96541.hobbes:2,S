   Firewall is using http-gw v. 1.17. Problem seems to be limited to
   web pages which use POST-method to get user input. When using those
   forms Netscape always puts out following warning: "A network error
   occured while Netscape was receiving data. (Network Error:
   Connection reset by peer)".
http-gw needs to be fixed to read all bytes sent to it before closing
the TCP socket.  This is what elicits the resets...
