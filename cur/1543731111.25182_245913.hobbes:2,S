What does MacOS X do?  Someone said that documents are directories in
it; it must know how to handle that.
What does Windows do when you click on a .zip file and WinZIP is
installed?  It opens the .zip file and lets you explore inside.  When
you click on a .doc file, though, it opens a viewer or editor -- you
don't get the option to look inside.

This is why I favour storing all essential metadata (about the file's
content) inside the file's contents, the primary stream.
We have another problem: what happens when users want to transfer data
from Windows (with secondary streams) and MacOS (with resource forks)?
