the 0.13 version had this mention: become stable. performance is scheduled
for next versions. you may try eepro.c from 2.2.13 kernel but as i could see
it's less stable than 0.13 version.

i think there's nobody else working on this driver right now. you may send
questions to lkml with a copy to me.
