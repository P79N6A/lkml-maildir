Hmmm... Lets see, we have a program (or set of programs) in memory that is 
thrashing, i. e. it is page faulting at a rate that is higher than the vm 
system can supply pages, so it is spending its time waiting for pages and the 
disk subsystem is busy.  Now, if we increase the amount of data cached from 
disk, without increasing main memory, we've decreased the amount of memory 
available to the thrashing program, perhaps making its problems worse?
Well, I guess all this shows is that with the vm subsystem, speculation is 
often useless, one has to fire up the box with a carefully constructed 
workload and see what happens.

I certainly agree with that.  Time for this thread to die, I think.  :-)

The box said: "Requires Windows 98 or better",
            so I installed Linux.
