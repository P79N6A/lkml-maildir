Unfortunately, as I understand it, the fix is done to "unhide" the SMBus 
that otherwyse is not seen but it has unexpected side effect of messing 
ioports allocation/reservation. I guess lspci with and without the fix 
could help to understand the problem. Here is the comment on top of the 
function :
/*
  * On ASUS P4B boards, the SMBus PCI Device within the ICH2/4 southbridge
  * is not activated. The myth is that Asus said that they do not want the
  * users to be irritated by just another PCI Device in the Win98 device
  * manager. (see the file prog/hotplug/README.p4b in the lm_sensors
  * package 2.7.0 for details)
  *
  * The SMBus PCI Device can be activated by setting a bit in the ICH LPC
  * bridge. Unfortunately, this device has no subvendor/subdevice ID. So it
  * becomes necessary to do this tweak in two steps -- I've chosen the Host
  * bridge as trigger.
  */
BTW, maybe we should change the comment because it is on many ASUS 
boards if not all ...
