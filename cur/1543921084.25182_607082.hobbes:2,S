Building on x86-64, I'm betting?  :)
I fell victim to the same thing a few days ago, missing some compile 
breakage that only appeared with
     make ARCH=i386 allmodconfig && make ARCH=i386 -sj9
Though am I alone in dreaming of a kernel.org service that would permit 
all-arch build testing of a git URL?
