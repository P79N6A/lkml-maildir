Perhaps the kernel should try reading beyond the ends of disks when it 
detects them, so that it can determine if there's actually available 
storage there, and automatically increase the size if there is? Or, at 
least, it could check whether the medium actually goes out to the point 
the partition table implies, and suppress the I/O error if the disk 
actually ends where it claims to.

I think I've seen cameras format SD cards like this. If I understand the 
situation correctly, it's a pain to mount them, because the kernel pokes 
around beyond the end of the medium trying to determine the filesystem 
type. In this case, wouldn't the right thing be to add the partition as 
ending at the end of the disk, rather than where it claims to?

I think cropping the partition to the size of the copied area is fine 
here, too, and should generate I/O errors on the partition without errors 
on the underlying block device, so it will be more clear that the hardware 
is fine, but your filesystem has problems (i.e., part of it isn't 
included).
In any case, I don't think it makes sense to leave the partition and 
underlying device inconsistant, rather than correcting one or the other.
