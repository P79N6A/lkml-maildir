I am just begining to test out 2.6 with an eye on use by X-terminals without 
hard drives or NFS. As such I am quite enthusiastic about initramfs.  After 
much stumbling around I created a root image that I would like to test, 
compiled into kernel and created image.
I am doing testing under VMWare with 2.88 MB floppy images (for testing 
purposes), but lilo is barfing trying to write to a regular file as a raw 
device (doesn't know how to handle device 0x0700).
I cannot use a real floppy because I do not have any 2.88 MB floppies
Any suggestions?  
Thanks for the help.
