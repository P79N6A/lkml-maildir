Hmmm that works pretty well, but it's lacking in some ways.
/dev/hdc3 /root/slash reiserfs rw 0 0
/dev/hdc3 /home/dave/blah resierfs rw 0 0
The above is not very descriptive.
/etc/mtab has:
/ /root/slash none rw,bind 0 0
/home/dave/public_html /home/dave/blah none rw,bind 0 0
Which tells me more about what I care about for 'bind' mounts.
However it does violate the "privacy" of the namespace by telling
everyone on the system how I have my stuff mounted :).
/proc/self/mounts does a much better job respecting this privacy but
doesn't give the information I really care about.
I think I'm looking for something like "ns" on Plan 9 or Inferno that
dumps out how my current namespace is constructed.  Each process with
a private namespace should get different results for "ns".
