You still want to do some printk(), otherwise we'll get very ugly bug
reports ("it does not suspend and I don't know why"). Also without
check in swsusp.c, this could corrupt data (page table accessed bits
might flip something during copy).

If you want this FIXME fixed, I got patch from Aristeu Sergio Rozanski
Filho <aris@cathedrallabs.org>. Not yet tested, that's why I was
holding it. (attached).
