How about "have proven to be stable" or "we have determined to be
stable" or "we have defined as being stable and will not break"
instead?

Maybe a note here that "testing" interfaces may be change in
incompatible ways before moving to stable/ if grave errors or security
vulnerabilities are found in them?

A note here that people should check
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt perhaps?

Perhaps add something along the lines of "Stability of the interface
is only guaranteed through the helper library, if you choose to
disregard this and use the raw kernel interface anyway, then your
program may break without warning in future kernel releases.".

Perhaps also a line here specifying the first mainline kernel release
(not -mm or -rc, but first stable kernel) that the interface is
available with. ??

In my oppinion it should be a requirement that an interface spends at
least one kernel release in the "testing" state before moving to
"stable" and can't be added to "stable" straight away.
Just my 0.02 euro :-)
