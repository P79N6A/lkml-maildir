Maybe am I misunderstanding something, but kmem_cache_cpu does not seem
to be passed to __slab_free() at all, nor any data referenced by it. So
why do we care about being preempted there ?

Since we are only doing this on the slow path, it does not hurt.
preempt_check_resched() is embedded in preempt_enable() and has a very
low impact (simple thread flag check in the standard case).
