They are quite simple and logical, actually. If you have write permission
to a file, you can edit it (change the contents). Removing and creating
files in a directory is "editing" the directory, i.e. the permissions of
the directory (not the file itself) apply. An exception to this rule is
that if a directory has the sticky bit set, removing files is restricted to
files you own yourself. This can be useful on publicly writable tmp
directories.

The logic is that you have full control of your own directory. If there are
several (hard) links to the file, you aren't even deleting the file, just
removing one of the references.
You can't chown files as a regular user.  In some (older) versions of Unix
you can give away a file you own, but that possibility was removed when
disk quotas were introduced.
