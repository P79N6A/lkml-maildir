Well, most arch Makefiles could use some cleaning up - also with respect
to te construct above. My point was that there is no need to list
prerequisites as several rules when they can be combined as one.
And the fact that a temporary is generated could well be hidden.
By the way I made a mistake, it should be:
include/asm-$(ARCH)/asm-offsets.h: arch/$(ARCH)/kernel/asm-offsets.s \
                                 include/asm include/linux/version.h \
                                 include/config/MARKER
	@echo -n '  Generating $@'
	@$(generate-asm-offsets.h) < $< > $@.tmp
	@$(update-if-changed)
