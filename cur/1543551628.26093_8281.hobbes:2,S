The soltuion you have chosen is not acceptable, the ordering is
critical and is why all of this stuff is done this way in the first
place.  The members must be in _that_ order and the alignment must
occur at that precise spot.
So please propose another patch, perhaps option #1 (the easiest) which
preserves the existing structure layout.
THanks.
Later,
