OK I set that bug to FEEDBACK, but it's open 5 months now and no testers
are forthcoming.  I think if we don't find one as a result of this
thread we can assume no one cares about this hardware anymore.
I'm still not sure that just adding it to the ALSA driver and hoping it
works is the best solution.  Would we rather users see right away that
their hardware isn't supported, or have the driver load and get no sound
or hang the machine?
I think the best approach might just be to drop it in lieu of a tester.
It will be trivial to add support later if someone finds one of these
boxes.
