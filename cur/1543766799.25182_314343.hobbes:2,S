There was implementation for that, but I dropped it due to broken code
[fix was simple, but there is issue number 2]
and I think it may end up in various microkerel-alike message queues.
Since I worked too much with projects that are based on such design,
so I afraid it will be very bad to allow such using in Linux kernel.
Although it can be compile-time or something...
