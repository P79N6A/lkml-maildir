Hi,
cdc-acm was broken since after 2.6.4, due to the alt_cursetting changes. I sent a patch, which has been integrated (well, the same one has ;-)) not long ago.
I gave 2.6.6-rc1 a try, and found that cdc-acm is now broken is a new way:
when plugging the phone, acm_probe() fails on interface #0; I traced the problem to this: usb_interface_claimed() returns true - and in fact intf->dev.driver is already cdc-acm (despite the fact that this is the first call to acm_probe() !), for reasons beyond my comprehension.
But, even if the interface is claimed, the intfdata hasn't been set, which allows to do another check: the attached patch fixes this bug. 
HTH,
