Hiya,
    Does anyone know how to get a working setup with one of these? 
usbserial seems to be working fine on this device, but there doesnt seem 
to be a working joystick driver for it? Google seems to knwo nothing 
apart from the single entry in the usb.ids list. Any help would be 
appreciated.
    Matt
