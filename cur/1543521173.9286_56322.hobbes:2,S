Yes, that works!
fwiw, this comment in mm/init.c is in the wrong place.  The
`page_is_ram' function is only used for high memory.  The comment should
be in kernel/setup.c if anywhere.

I'd be inclined to put all the e820 corrections in one place, perhaps by
altering the map in setup_memory_region.  How about defining a new type
E820_UNUSABLE and changing broken usable regions to unusable ones, so
they show up in the log.
My Toshiba is now working with Pavel's memory test, when I disable the
region 4000@e8000 by h-h-h-hack.
