Last week-end, I was hapily filling my VFAT Win98 partition using cdparanoia when I fullfiled the disk by mistake.
As a result, I got a "disk out of space" or something similar (normal...), but then I could not remove anything from that partition : rm command returned an error message saying that the partition was mounted read-only !
When I rebooted (using halt, then hard-reset), I noticed my partition table for that disk was corrupted. Recreating the partition table as before didn't help : data was completely corrupted on that disk.
I am using a SuSE Linux 6.1 with kernel 2.2.9. I could reproduce the bug on either IDE or SCSI disks.
