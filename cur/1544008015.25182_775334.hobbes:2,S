that is what happened three weeks ago already on Nov 11, we applied
Peter's patches to tip/x86/irq:
   939b787: x86: 64 bits: shrink and align IRQ stubs
   b7c6244: x86: 32 bits: shrink and align IRQ stubs
it's all in the x86 tree and in linux-next as well. Alexander and Peter 
are working on this together, not against each other. Alexander was still 
running some numbers to make sure we made the right decision.
