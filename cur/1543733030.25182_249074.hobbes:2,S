I like to call them fildirutes (file/directory/attribute).  A file
typing system would tell you the intended purpose of a particular
fildurute.  So if a fildurute called X has X/..metas/mimefiletype
containing "application/x-directory" then you know that it should be
treated as being primarily a container for other fildirutes and shown
to the user as a folder in a GUI view.  If it said it was
"application/x-text-document" then the GUI system would default to
opening it in a word processor.  Either way, that's only a hint about
how it should be presented to the user, not something the kernel
enforces.
For efficiency, the file type might just be stored in the fildirute's
inode as a code number (since most things would have a file type) that
the file system exposes as a file called ..metas/mimefiletype.
