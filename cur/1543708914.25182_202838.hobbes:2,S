I've tried it with and without DMA. But in both cases i got errors 
although the were different. I made some changes so i can't post the 
error with the DMA turned on. I can reverse the changes on Monday and 
post the errors for you.

I'm trying to get a serial line connection working to log the bootlogs. 
I can make them as well on Monday.
I tried to boot with the cpqarray removed from the 2.6.3 kernel. In that 
case i don't get the errors from the ide devices during the kernel boot 
so i guess the solution made in the 2.6 according the ide problem is 
working. Again on Monday i want to try the patch from Erik B. Andersen 
on the 2.4 kernel. If i understood it all right. I'm not really into 
kernel hacking etc.
THX for the help so far..
