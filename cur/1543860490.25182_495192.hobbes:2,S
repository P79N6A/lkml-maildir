No, I completely agree with you on this.
If firmworks really wants to have a spearate filesystem that's fine.
But please start with the ppc or sparc code and massage it into a
a separate filesystem before adding support for a new platform.
The last thing we need is more duplication.
In case anyone wants to start this based on ppc I'd gladfully help
to test this on pmac (32 and 64bit) and cell (64 bit).
