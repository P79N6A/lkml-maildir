So you wait for the first read() or write() call to you driver if you get
an open() with O_RDWR. You could also use additional heuristics, i.e.. an
O_TRUNC flag certainly indicates that the program will want to write.  ;-)
Dd uses O_RDWR because its skip() code falls back to read()ing the head of
the file if it can't lseek() to the position you want. IMHO that's not
necessary if you didn't give it any seek= option.
Patch to fileutils follows.
