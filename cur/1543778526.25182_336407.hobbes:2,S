You turned off 4k stacks?  I have a Via KM400 chipset box locked 
up a few times, once under 2.4.31-hf2 after 4.5 hours compiling 
kernels, fixed with some .config tuning.  Done 48+ hours continuous 
compiling kernels with 2.6.12.3 + 8k stacks, load ~2.2.  Just adding 
a datapoint...  Dunno if this relevant.  Simpler, older box with 
Intel 440BX chipset is happy with 4k stacks, only 2 USB ports.
Grant.
