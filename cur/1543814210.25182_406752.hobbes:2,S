Ok, I'm confused.  What fixed math?  The return EIP that is pushed here 
is used when sysenter is active and you have to IRET back to userspace.  
If that EIP is dynamically relocatable, you can't do fixed math unless 
you patch the pushl site dynamically.  Notable reasons for returning via 
IRET on this fake exception frame were (until my recent submission) IOPL 
changes, but I believe there were more.  I will have to inspect the 
source to determine if that is still the case.
