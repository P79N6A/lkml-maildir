Subject: busmaster and C-States [Was: [PATCH] i386 no idle HZ aka Dynticks 051203]

Instead of Con Koliva's approach to fix dyntick and the busmaster logic in
the ACPI idle handler (see
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/dyn-ticks/split-out/dyntick-busmaster_support.patch
) I propose this different patch as a replacement. Its
skipped_since_bm_check() is broken, as it returns the number of ticks we
hope to go to sleep for _now_, not how long we slept last time.
Some test result:
ck:
   *C2:                  type[C2] promotion[C3] demotion[C1] latency[001]
        usage[00066141] time[00000000001817309417]
    C3:                  type[C3] promotion[--] demotion[C2] latency[085]
        usage[00005760] time[00000000000138436523]
At average, sleeping for 7 ticks when in C2
At average, sleeping for 6 ticks when in C3
me:
    C2:                  type[C2] promotion[C3] demotion[C1] latency[001]
usage[00143551] time[00000000002930357624]
   *C3:                  type[C3] promotion[--] demotion[C2] latency[085]
usage[00079181] time[00000000002733459218]
At average, sleeping for 5 ticks when in C2
At average, sleeping for 9 ticks when in C3
Not perfect yet (but see the next patch), but better.
Only avoid entering C3-type sleep if there is bus master activity at the
moment. 
Also, bus mastering activity going on while we slept can be ignored.
Therefore, adjust the bm_check_timestamp accordingly.
