Cedrik,
You made my day, I am really happy to hear that! Such testing and 
benchmarking should be done by an independent third party, and IBM fits 
that requirement just fine. It all makes much sense for everybody who's 
involved.
If it will be opened (not just results, but also the processes and 
tools), and all the projects will be able to contribute and help, that 
would be just great. We do a lot of testing in-house, and will be happy 
to contribute to such an independent testing/benchmarking project.
Speaking of live migration, we in OpenVZ plan to release our 
implementation as soon as next week.
Regards,
  Kir.
