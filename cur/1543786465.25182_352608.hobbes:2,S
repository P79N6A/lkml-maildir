What we probably need then is an official policy that maintainers need
to have an account in the bugzilla. Start with the subsystem maintainers
and leave it to them to get each driver maintainer in line. Having only
a handful of parts of the kernel in the bugzilla is just confusing.
Personally I think the mailing lists are a great way for general
discussion. But once we have a confirmed bug (or difficult new feature)
it is better off being tracked in bugzilla. And this is my opinion both
as a user and as a developer. Bugzilla is the de facto standard of
reporting bugs so some users might find it troublesome dealing with
mailing lists such as LKML.
