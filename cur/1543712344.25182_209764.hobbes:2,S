The block layer / scheduler guys should also think about a general (not 
SCSI specific) way to tune TCQ tag depth.  That's IMO another policy 
decision.
I'm about to add a raft of SATA-2 hardware, all of which are queued. 
The standard depth is 32, but one board supports a whopping depth of 256.
Given past discussion on the topic, you probably don't want to queue 256 
requests at a time to hardware :)  But the sysadmin should be allowed 
to, if they wish...
