Absolutely true, but you cannot afford to have 4-way 2+Ghz P4 Xeon at
home easily. Those are cheap machines to get more that 2-way SMP for
tweaking with scalability. I have 2 quad-PPRO 'in my collection' and
those are the 'pearls of it'. One that i'd really like to have is that
8-way NCR WorldMark PPRO, but those are rare (i have spotted one tho,
but it's still on production).
Heck. Now we (i) am talking about these babies, i even have 3-way P166
SMP machine which is working just fine :)
Still, when we talk about compiling kernel and like, i prefer 2Ghz
athlon or something over quad-PPRO as it's still running loops around
any old stuff while compiling.

Aquanta should be exactly 6x6 motherboard w/ different BIOS.
