freitag mentioned that IRQ stacks should be bootmem allocated, so I
dredged up a series of debug patches I had that did so. This is in no
way intended as a suggestion we should e.g. merge config options as
in 1/6 for 64KB stacks.
This is all sort of meant to be cherrypicked mostly for 5/6's bootmem
allocation of IRQ stacks. Otherwise it's just a set of debug patches
I wrote. 1/6 is merely needed for 5/6 to eventually apply. 5/6 can't
really be used verbatim because it does various handling for vmalloc()
of stacks and depends on the patches in the series prior to it, but
it is something in the way of bootmem allocation of IRQ stacks being
out there already.
