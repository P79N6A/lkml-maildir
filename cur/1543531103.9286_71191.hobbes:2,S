Note that even the global variable still has the ret_from_sys_call race.
current->need_resched is used to avoid cache line ping pong between
processors I guess.  Another easy way to fix the race would be to have a
per-CPU need_resched flag, and use need_resched [current->processor]
rather than current->need_resched.
For uniprocessors, going back to a global variable seems like a sensible
idea anyway.  It is faster.  Same goes for any other per-cpu data stored
in current.
