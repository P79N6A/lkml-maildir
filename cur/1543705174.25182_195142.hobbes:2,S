Okay. I'll ask then.

Sourceforge have a donations thing now, but I haven't done my bit to
sign the project up for it. Frankly, after all the support LinuxFund
gave over the last four months, I'd rather encourage people to give to
them :>

Yes, I worked hard on making it play nicely with them. It does replace
the refrigerator they used, but if I've done it right and it hasn't been
broken it since (by any of the three of us), they shouldn't care.

Suspend2 will use any swap space you have available. It will even
automatically turn on a swap partition or file for you at the start of
suspending, and turn it off at the end. It doesn't care about how the
swap space is distributed or whether it's a partition or a file or a
combination. Saving to local IDE and SCSI is tested, but I've had
limited success with SCSI due to the lack of power management on the
drives I was testing with (the machine resumed up to the point where it
wanted to use the SCSI drive again with the restored kernel, at which
point the driver paniced because the request numbers were out of sync).

2.6 has problems with flushing caches properly at the moment. It might
be related to that. I'd need more info to properly diagnose the problem.
