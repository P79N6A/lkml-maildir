Hmm, my fix was intended to fix a gdb problem. Or rather the gdb
problem was already fixed by disabling some functionality and with
this patch the functionality would be reenabled again.
If it fixed a qemu problem too that's great but was unintended
on my part. In fact it is a little worrying because there should
be no user visible change. Can you double check by unapply/test/reapply/test
the patch really makes a difference?

I don't know. Someone has to debug it.
