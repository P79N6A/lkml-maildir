Hi Ove,
that's exactly what I've done, I added a couple of variables in the task
struct ( is_rk_task, rk_debug, migration, etc ), and I'm doing that to
track the execution/path taken.
I was aware of the smp_send_reschedule() function, although I cannot say
that I completely/fully understand what is doing, so yes, it's a good
idea to instrument it.
However, my problem still remains, and that is, although I could send an
smp_send_reschedule() to another CPU ( so a new RK task assigned to that
CPU will be selected for execution ), I would like to do that only if
the task running in that CPU is not an RK task ( an RK task - resource
kernel task - is a higher priority task than regular timesharing
processes, and so it should preempt a running process in that CPU ). On
the other hand, if the task running in the target CPU is an RK task,
then the new RK task shouldn't preempt that task, it should enqueue
itself in the runqueue with its policy ( realtime FIFO ) and priority
raised. Hopefully, when the running RK task in the target CPU finishes
executing ( has consumed its reserved capacity ) the new task will be
selected for execution.
I haven't looked at 2.3.9, think that I'll download and take a look at
it.
Thanks,
Hugo
