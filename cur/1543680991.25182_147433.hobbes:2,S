If we don't apply oversized checks to reads, what keeps a big streaming
reader from starving out all the writes?
The current patch provides a relatively fixed amount of work to get a
request, and I don't think we should allow that to be bypassed.  We
might want to add a special case for synchronous reads (like bread), via
a b_state bit that tells the block layer an immediate unplug is coming
soon.  That way the block layer can ignore the oversized checks, grant a
request and unplug right away, hopefully lowering the total number of
unplugs the synchronous reader has to wait through.
Anyway, if you've got doubts about the current patch, I'd be happy to
run a specific benchmark you think will show the bad read
characteristics.
