Subject: [UPDATE] [PATCH 0/3] Demand faulting for hugetlb
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/8/242

Sending this out again after incorporating the feedback from Yanmin
Zhang and Dave Hansen.  Are we ready to go for -mm yet?  The only patch
which has seen any recent changes is #2 below so I assume people agree
with #1 and #3 now :)
The three patches:
 1) Remove a get_user_pages() optimization that is no longer valid for
demand faulting
 2) Move fault logic from hugetlb_prefault() to hugetlb_pte_fault()
 3) Apply a simple overcommit check so demand fault accounting behaves
in a manner in line with how prefault worked
Diffed against 2.6.13-git6
