This is about the fifth report of unhandled interrupts.  Against the fifth
driver which looks to be correct.
So I'd be suspecting the scenario which Alan outlined: the IRQ handler looped
around, scooped up the interrupt source before the APIC delivered the IRQ.
I'm working on the actual detection code - it tries to filter out the false
positives.
Suggest we ignore these reports until that is sorted out.
