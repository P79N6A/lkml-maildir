Why waste 64 bits of valuable type information in every pointer?
We could have a pointer type consisting of 64 bits pointing to the data
and 64 bits pointing to its vtbl and RTTI data.  Implementing multiple
inheritance in C++ would be a snap.  Heck, it'd be possible to do MI
in _C_.  You'd never port anything native to that architecture to another
architecture though...
