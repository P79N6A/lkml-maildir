I count two callers of page_cache_alloc in 2.6.9rc2 (filemap.c and
XFS pagebuf). Hardly seems like a big issue to change them both. 
Of course getting the offset there might be tricky, but should be 
doable.

Your counter can have the same worst case behaviour, just 
different.  You only have to add freeing into the picture.
Or when you consider getting more memory bandwidth from the interleaving
(I know this is not your primary goal with this) then a sufficient
access pattern could lead to rather uninterleaved allocation 
in the file.
Any allocation algorithm will have such a worst case, so I'm not
too worried. Given ia hash function is not too bad it should
be bearable.
The nice advantage of the static offset is that it makes benchmarks
actually repeatable and is completely lockless

I think I'm still a bit confused by your terminology.
I thought the page cache policy was per process? Now you
are talking about another global unrelated policy?
With the per process policy the only way to change the policy
for the whole system is to change it in init and restart everything.
With a global policy you could change it on the fly, but 
it probably wouldn't make too much sense without a restart
because there would be already too much cache with the wrong
policy.
Anyways, I guess you could just add a high flag bit to the 
mode argument of set_mempolicy. Something like
set_mempolicy(MPOL_PAGECACHE | MPOL_INTERLEAVE, nodemask, len)
That would work for setting the page cache policy of the current
process.
