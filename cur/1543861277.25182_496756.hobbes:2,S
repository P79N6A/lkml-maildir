Let me put that differently.  That should be done as a separate
patch, adding (a) that platform_device, and maybe platform_data
if it's got additional alarm registers, and (b) Kconfig support
to let that work.  I'd call it a "patch #4 of 3".  ;)
The current Kconfig uses:

Eventually maybe the PC-or-ACPI stuff should vanish, but IMO
not until this code has been used on a few other platforms.
