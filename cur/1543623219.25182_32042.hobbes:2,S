It might be very difficult to fix up the
low latency patch for the latest -ac,
but the mini-low-latency patch should
go right in - that should fix the worst
of it, and I've run 2.4.19-pre2-ac1 with
the mini low-latency patch.
It's part of the -aa patch collection, just
look for "00_lowlatency-fixes-4" or so.
