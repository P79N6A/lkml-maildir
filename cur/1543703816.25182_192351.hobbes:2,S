I've compiled and tested the code you posted, i thought that i would add
that renicing the LISTENER processes shows some interesting effects.
at nice 0 the writer spits out about 40 writes under .01 ms, then 3 to 5
writes at 97+ ms, after about 3 minutes its starts to get more random.
at nice -1 the writer spits out about 40 writes under .01 ms, then about 40
writes at 97+ ms, kept this cycle for over 10 minutes.
at nice 1 the writer spits out a few hundred writes under .01 ms, and
occasionally one at 97+ ms.
same effect if elevator=deadline
This thread caught my intrest because I run qmail on this box.
