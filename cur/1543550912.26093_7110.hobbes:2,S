Struct returns are used by the page table handling, and it works. There
it's used for other reasons (better encapsulation and type-checking).
However, it generates reasonably efficient code only for the single-value
struct case (the case for most of the page tables out there), and the
syntax ends up being absolutely horrible for multi-values. Not worth it.
