Hello!
> This patch replaces the timer_bh with a tasklet.
But this is impossible, timers must not race with another BHs,
all the code using BHs depends on this. That's why they are BHs. 
Also, looping for timers seems to be pure pathalogy.
It can be raised only if you looped in softirq for a jiffie,
in this case waking ksoftirqd is not unusual.
I feel your goal is high res timers, right? You can do them separately
to avoid conflicts with classic timers.
