One thing that currently makes all solutions harder (and the #ifdef 
example above not ugly but simply wrong) is that you allow modular 
congestion control options for the always static net support.
Is this really required?
The IO schedulers have a similar problem, and they are using the #ifdef 
approach for selecting the default.
One approach is to actually choose the default using #ifdef's.
You could also do any kind of runtime selection, but please don't print 
the warning more than once.
