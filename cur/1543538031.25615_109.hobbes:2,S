Yes, that's true. But this also reminds me about "feature" that I hope gets
fixed in 2.4.
If there is a wild app that keeps allocating and committing memory at high
speed the system becomes unusable when it starts swapping. Only way out of
this loop is to hit reset-button, because system doesn't respond to any
keyboard events. I have that kind of bugs in my programs sometimes, last
time I implemented that in GNU Octave...
I think this as DOS attack and serious "bug", because ordinary user is able
to put machine in unusable state!
