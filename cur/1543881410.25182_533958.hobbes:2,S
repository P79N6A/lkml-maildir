Alas, we are not vxworks developers, and probably most of us know zero
about the use-cases for this feature, why embedded systems find it
valuable, etc.
So it's up to you to tell us all this.

We don't have enough information to make that call.

The obvious question is: what's _wrong_ with doing all this in some
cut-down userspace environment like busybox?  Why is this stuff better?
Obviously some embedded developers have considered that option and
have rejected it.  But we do need to be told, at length, why that
decision was made.
