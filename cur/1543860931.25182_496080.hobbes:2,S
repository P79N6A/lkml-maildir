Subject: S.M.A.R.T no longer available in 2.6.20-rc2-mm2 with libata

Not sure what went on between 2.6.19-rc5-mm2 and 2.6.20-rc2-mm2 in 
libata land but SMART is no longer available on my hdds.   I'm assuming 
this is not the intended behavior. 
In case this is chipset specific, IDE interface: nVidia Corporation 
CK804 Serial ATA Controller (rev f3)
I'm using Libata nvidia driver, the drives happen to be sata drives, but 
even the pata ones no longer report having SMART.
