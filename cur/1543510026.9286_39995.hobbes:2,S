I have my Athlon running with 2.2.13pre9 and 2.3.18ac6.
Alan, I found some problems with my Voodoo3 3000 and my MSI MS-6167 main
board (BIOS).
When ever I set the MTRRs for the Voodoo3 I get in trouble (only with
3D/Glide). Yes, I get some big trouble under Win98/98 SE, too. It never
runs under Win at this time!
I think it is under Win MTRR related, too. But I can't get access to the
MTRR registers under Winbloze.
Which Athlon main board have you got, Alan? Reversion? BIOS?
Have you got a Winbloze tool to fiddle around with the MTRR registers?
I am still in contact with MSI/3dfx/AMD.
Regards,
        Dieter
