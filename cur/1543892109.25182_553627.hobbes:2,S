Which, with this patch, we will respect for tasks marked TIF_MEMDIE as 
well.

And that's what nearest_exclusive_ancestor() determines later on if we're 
not requesting GFP_HARDWALL.

This is precisely the point: we already respect PF_EXITING tasks with 
their ability to allocate outside their own cpuset.  That gets set in 
do_exit() when a task is in receipt of the SIGKILL from the OOM killer 
during the exit path.  Between these time periods (the time when we issue 
the OOM SIGKILL and the time we're marked PF_EXITING in do_exit()), we 
should not allow allocations outside of our cpuset because we do not yet 
have the guarantee that they will exit synchronously or reliably.

Sure, that behavior is unchanged.  We're relying on 
nearest_exclusive_ancestor() to determine if such nodes overlap.
