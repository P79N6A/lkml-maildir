I think we should work toward being able to enable kernel preemption in
Fedora, then, instead of other tangential solutions.
And I disagree with the overhead argument.  I have seen no specific
arguments that show a significant overhead.  Heck, when people tried to
show that kernel preemption hurt throughput, we saw tests that showed
improved throughput (probably due to better utilization of I/O).
But stability is a subjective argument (and I agree we need more driver
love, at least for obscure drivers) wrt kernel preemption.  So I would
say we should concentrate on working on the stability[1] so we could
just enable kernel preemption unconditionally and not designing new
solutions.
Best,

[1] What better way than enabling CONFIG_PREEMPT for Fedora?  Enable it
for Fedora, and do not enable it for Red Hat Enterprise until you are
confidant.  ;-)
