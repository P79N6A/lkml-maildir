That'd be a interesting philosophical (and somewhat offtopic) flamewar:
It's is theorically possible to write a operative system with bells and
whistles for a computer with 200 MB of ram? 200 MB is really a lot of
ram....I'm really surprised at how easy is to write a program that eats
a docen of MB of ram just by showing a window and a few buttons.
In my perfect world, a superhero (say, Linus ;) would analyze and
redesign the whole software stack and would fix it. IMO some parts
of a complete gnu linux system have been accumulating fat with the
time, ej: plan 9's network abstraction could make possible to
kill tons of networking code from lot of apps...
