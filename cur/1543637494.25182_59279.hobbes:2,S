Unfortunately, this does not help "soft real-time" tasks like the
hypothetical video game with a compile running in the background.  That
needs to preempt lower priority tasks somehow.
Ideally, because they don't use much CPU but do want to run on time, it
should be possible to run those programs using non-real-time priority,
and they would run on time simply because they always have a high
dynamic priority.
To be fair, although 100Hz timer resolution wasn't good enough even for
a simple "snake" video game with no other load (the eye detects the time
variance as an apparent velocity variance), 1000Hz is probably fine.

What will happen if the timer granularity remains at 1000Hz when
loadavg > 1 is that time-sensitive interactive apps will still busy wait
for the remainder of a tick.  _But_, if we can define select() or similar
semantics to mean, as Linus suggested, "wait until at most TIME", then
it becomes possible to avoid the busy wait at low loads (paradoxically).

That's the sort of thing I work on :)  The resolution required of a
packet shaper is measured in 10s of microseconds, though, so I just
accept that user space must busy wait _all_ the time the link isn't idle.
