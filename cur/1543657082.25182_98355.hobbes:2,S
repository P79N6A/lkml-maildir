To me (I'm a compiler writer) it looks like your compiler did NOT
mess up. Assuming struct pollfd has 32-bit alignment, the compiler
is doing the right thing by starting entries[] at offset 12.
The 16-byte size for struct poll_list is because the 'next' field
has 64-bit alignment, which forces the compiler to pad struct
poll_lists's size to a multiple of 8 bytes, i.e. 16 bytes in this
case. So the compiler is not broken.

But the old code which assumed pp+1 == pp->entries is so horribly
broken I can't find words for it. s/pp+1/pp->entries/ is the correct fix.
