After running this new kernel for a while i guess i have hit this issue:
http://www.boblycat.org/~malc/apc/bad-load.png
Top and icewm's monitor do show incredibly huge load while in reality 
nothing like that is really happening. Both ad-hoc and `/proc/stat' (idle)
show normal CPU utilization (7% since i'm doing some A/V stuff in the
background)
