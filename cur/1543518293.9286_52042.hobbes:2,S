Progress. Your complaint reached me via all kinds of detours
each time with different fragments of information. Here you
forget the kernel version (I seem to recall that you mentioned
2.2.14pre11 elsewhere) but otherwise this is precisely what we need.

No, you shouldnt.
If there is a strange bug in the kernel then the kernel must be fixed.
And there really is something very strange... CHS=40681/247/228.
The number of sectors per track cannot be larger than 63 since it is
a 6-bit number. Moreover, the numbers of heads and of cylinders are
strange as well. So, this sounds as if your BIOS is totally confused
and reports ridiculous values to the kernel.
(Or, the kernel is broken and uses random data for CHS.)
Let us add a check that what comes from the BIOS is reasonable.
Alan, it may be a good idea to apply this to 2.2.14pre*:

Wichert - if you apply this (to linux/drivers/block/ide-probe.c),
does it make any difference? If not, we'll have to find the source
of your strange number of sectors elsewhere.
You can also try both versions: with disk in BIOS and not in BIOS.
Do you also have SCSI disks? Do you boot from SCSI?
