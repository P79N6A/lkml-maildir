Two people told me it's a bad idea so far.

I think it would be a great chance to fix hardware dependent things 
where it is the best place. What can hwclock do that the kernel 
can't, or: How can hwclock set the kernel, if the kernel can't. Would 
you implement code for any of the platforms using #ifdef or what?

It wouldn't be much different from now. Just imagine if you set the 
time (maybe using settimeofday()), the kernel will the timezone it 
knows about to update the clock.  I don't want to put the DST 
decision logic into the kernel, just the timezone offset.
The latter is needed by DOSish filesystems anyway.

I hope you realize that timezone is basically a number ;-)

I had a kilobytes or something like that in mind, with the 
possibility to simplyfy some other stuff.  Maybe really have a look  
to the current snapshot of PPSkit-0.9.0pre2. You will get a feeling 
what parts are missing...
