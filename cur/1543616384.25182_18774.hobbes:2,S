The C programming language and MMIO are two different things that must not
be mixed.
'volatile' is not enough a portable a concept to deal with MMIO. You also
need to tell about what is atomic and what is not atomic regarding
accesses through the involved BUS, for example. As a result, you may use
'volatile' to avoid assembly for MMIO, but you want to put the code in
architecture dependant code.
The atomicity issue also applies to memory-like access obviously, but the
compiler is expected to know about the architecture capabilities. If this
may differ for a given architecture family, then some compiler options
should be made available.
