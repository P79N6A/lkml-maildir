Could you show us how this particular situation might be laid out in a 
driverfs/kfs/gregfs tree?
It's great that you keep suggesting this, but we have another 
chicken-and-egg problem.
<SOAPBOX>
The problem with driverfs today is that it isn't worth it for _me_ to
use it to just get this one, single thing.  If I used driverfs right 
now, the only thing that I would get out of it would be ... buddyinfo! 
How is it worth my while to use it on a shared machine where most 
people probably won't be mounting driverfs, or _want_ it mounted as 
the default?

If even its most ardent supporters don't like its name...
