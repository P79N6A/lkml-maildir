It has been spotted [1] and diagnosed [2] about two weeks ago. I guess the
reason it took so long is that in addition to the debugging options, you
need a kernel that does call the spinlock code _and_ you need to look at
the kernel log even though the behavior is unchanged.
Anyhow, the mdelay to msleep conversion is useful only for a corner case: a
user with Rhine-I hardware (ancient) who needs low latency even while
fiddling with the NIC's media settings. I am not sure it's worth the
trouble. Any suggestions for an elegant solution?
