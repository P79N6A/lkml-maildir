Yeah, I have no idea what '\777' is supposed to be - that's 9 bits wide.

Since the __guard symbol isn't used directly by C code it doesn't matter
what type it is, right?  You should be able to just say something like:
unsigned char __guard[sizeof(int)] = { '\0', '\0', '\n', (unsighed char) -1 };
Or maybe you want those in the opposite order for endianness.. not sure.
Having the '\0' first in memory makes the most sense to me but I haven't
thought about it much.

1. "damaged" should be "unsigned int"; it's used with a "%x" format specifier
2. "func" should probably be "const char *func"
3. Why is message[] defined instead of just using it directly in the call
   to panic like panic("blah blah...", ...)  Maybe I'm missing something
   subtle there.
