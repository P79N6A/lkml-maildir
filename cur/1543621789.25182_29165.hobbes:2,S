       ENOTTY d  is  not  associated  with  a  character  special
              device.
       ENOTTY The specified request does not apply to the kind of
              object that the descriptor d references.
Lots and lots of ioctls return ENOTTY when passed a request
which they don't understand.  There's probably a great reason
for this, but I can't immediately think what it might be.
