The results are that stable? A kernel compilation which slightly 
rearranges cachelines due to code and data changes typically leads to a 
larger variance on my 8 way box (gets even larger under NUMA). I would 
expect that the variations on a database load would be more significant.
I repeatedly saw patches from Intel to do minor changes to SLAB that 
increase performance by 0.5% or so (like the recent removal of a BUG_ON 
for performance reasons). These do not regress again when you build a 
newer kernel release?
