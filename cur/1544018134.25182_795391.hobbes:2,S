Hello, Mark.
Sorry about slacking off.  Having way too much fun mucking around
assembly code lately.

devres does handle MSI.  Please take a look at pcim_release() in
drivers/pci/pci.c.  msi/msix enabledness is tracked by
pdev->msi[x]_enabled and if either one was enabled on a managed PCI
device, it would be disabled on driver detach, so there's no reason to
worry about it.
Also, there is no reason for low level driver to dingle with intx.  In
fact, it shouldn't as PCI quirk is supposed to handle all the pretty
quirkiness.  The intx code was there before the quirk code was in
place and no one went after them.  They should go and probably won't
cause any problem in the process.
Thanks.
