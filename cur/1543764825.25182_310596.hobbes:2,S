Hi,
I would like to ask when a userprogram called in user space called 
execve("/bin/abc"....   will  this system call finally copy the code of 
/bin/abc into kernel space before kernel runs it or just leave the code 
in the userspace and run directly ?  If the system really copy the 
program into kernel space , why ?
Hope some one can tell me
Regards,
TOM
