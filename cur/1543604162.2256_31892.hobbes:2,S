This is what we implemented as an extension to our MQ scheduler.
I will present on the results for this during ALS technical session:
"CPU Pooling and Load Balancing in Linux MultiQueue Scheduling".
If interested I can already put an earlier version on lse.sourceforge.net.
It basically does (1) and (2). (3) is done unintelligently right now.
