Hi!
> The following patch makes swsusp avoid problems during resume if there are too many
> pages to save on suspend.  It adds a constant that allows us to verify if we are going to
> save too many pages and implements the check (this is done as early as we can tell that
> the check will trigger, which is in swsusp_alloc()).

> This is to replace swsusp-prevent-swsusp-from-failing-if-theres-too-many-pagedir-pages.patch

> Please consider for applying.
