I just bought a dual celeron system with the ABIT BP-6 motherboard, I'm
not sure about what RedHat ECOmmerce is but i'm sure it still runs the
standard linux kernel.  I've had no problem installing RHAT 6.1 on it and
they are both overclocked to 550MHz so i'm sure it will run any release of
RHAT just fine....
