You're mistaken.
The magic to know about is that the x86 will, for a "pop" instruction, use
the %esp _after_ the pop for any modrm calculations, so
	pushfl
	popl 0x18(%esp)
the "0x18(%esp)" address will be calculated using %esp after the popl,
which is obviously the same as the %esp before the pushfl, which in turn
is exactly what gcc thinks it should be.
Of course, this didn't used to be true - one of the changes between the
286 and the 386 was exactly this "which %esp will be used" issue (or maybe
it was between the 186 and the 286 - quite a long time ago, in any case).
However, it had been an undocumented issue until then, and it IS
documented now.
