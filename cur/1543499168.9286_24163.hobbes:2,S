It is a matter of context-switching and race conditions. With knfsd, you
avoid many switches, and, moreover, the multiple nfsd threads may much
more easily cooperate.
All major unixes use some magic hook in the kernel for nfs servers:
for instance, BSD uses the nfssvc() system call.
Therefore knfsd is considered as "the way to go".
