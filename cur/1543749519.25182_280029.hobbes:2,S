For non x86 architectures, the changes required are typically
much less, and it makes sense to integrate them into the normal
architecture tree. This is what has been done with ia64, and will
be done with ppc. i386 and x86_64 are a special case where the
extensive changes required justify having an arch xen directory
with i386 and x86_64 subtrees beneath it (although many files are
just linked from the normal architecture).

Yep, that's the model, for the x86 family.
