Subject: Patch for people having trouble compiling kernel 2.3.51

Hi,
For people having trouble compiling kernel 2.3.51, I made a diff between
my tree and the clean kernel. This diff solves dozens (approx 25) problems
that can happen when compiling the 2.3.51 kernel. (But there are still
several problems left of course). 
The patch is available at
http://www.fenrus.demon.nl/kernel/patch-2.3.51-av1.gz
Greetings,

Changelog:
Makefile		
	ifdef -> ifeq for ATALK (assar@stacken.kth.se)
parport		
	fix by Tim Waugh (twaugh@redhat.com)
SGI Visual Workstation
	Doesn't compile at all, some files are missing.
	This should either be removed or forwardported
 	from 2.2.14/15
Magic SysRQ key
	This feature obviously depends on the presence of a keyboard.
	Instead of #ifdef'ing all over the place, this option is made
	depending on CONFIG_VT
Zoran ZR36120/36125
	This driver depends on I2C, this dependency is now made explicit
I2O PCI support
	This obviously depends on PCI being in the kernel
HIPPI network NIC driver
	The HIPPI network-driver depends on TCP/IP being in the kernel
Aironet 4500 NIC driver
	Some functions in the header are made "inline" to prevent
	nameclashes
Raytheon 2.4 GHz NIC driver
	Didn't compile for kernels without "/proc"
Roadrunner NIC driver
	Changed to reflect recent softnet changes
SysKonnect FDDI NIC
	card_start() is made static to prevent nameclash
SBNI WAN card
	card_start() is made static to prevent nameclash
Wavelan
	several things made static to prevent nameclash with the
	PCMCIA version
Yellowfin
	Didn't compile for people without modversions, because
	"modversions.h" was always included.
AIC7XXX SCSI 
	This driver depends on PCI being in the kernel
Adaptec 1542 SCSI
	This driver had a nameclash with the sb_card driver about
	"isapnp". 
Sound/bin2hex.c
	This file generated a header with an identifier that sometimes was  
	a #define, other times a static int. Drivers assigned values to
	the identifier. Now it always is a static int.
USB Config.in
	Lots of dependencies missing
ATY128 Framebuffer
	Didn't compile for i386 and PPC (partial fix)
HGA driver
	Fixed dependency on HGA_FBCON
ADFS filesystem
	First order fix for 64bit operations on i386 (We don't want
   	libgcc in the i386 kernel)
cramfs filesystem
	Changed the zlib code to contain a prefix of "cramfs_" to prevent
	nameclashes with the PPP zlib-code.
module.h
	Added stub for "try_inc_mod_count" for kernels without modules
pci.h
	Added stubs for "pci_assign_resource", "pci_register_driver" and
	"pci_unregister_driver"
lec ATM driver
	[partial fix] Fixed wrong #include file
Econet
	Still used "struct device" instead of "struct net_device"
IrDA	
	Removed compression (on DagB's suggestion)
	Added an #ifdef to allow the IrLAN driver to compile without
	TCP/IP
