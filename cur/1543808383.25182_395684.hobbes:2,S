No, I mean cachelines:
static void recalc_bh_state(void)
{
	int i;
	int tot = 0;
	if (__get_cpu_var(bh_accounting).ratelimit++ < 4096)
		return;
	__get_cpu_var(bh_accounting).ratelimit = 0;
	for_each_cpu(i)
		tot += per_cpu(bh_accounting, i).nr;
That's going to hit NR_CPUS cachelines even on a 2-way.
Or am I missing something really obvious here?
(Probably the most expensive ones will be get_page_state() and friends. 
And argh, they're still hardwired to CPU_MASK_ALL).
