Yeah, maybe.  But it feels a little like the question of whether
{pci,pnp,acpi_bus}_register_driver() should return the number of
devices found.  The consensus is that these functions should return
only a negative error, or zero for success, leaving any counting of
devices to the driver's .probe() or .add() method.
I think a loadable driver's init function *should* return success
even if no device is yet present.  Maybe you want to load the driver
before hot-adding the device.
The common idiom of, e.g.,
    static int __init serial8250_pci_init(void)
    {
        return pci_register_driver(&serial_pci_driver);
    }
should remain acceptable, though it returns 0 even if no devices
are found.
