Note that a factor 16 increase usually goes hand in hand with
more processors. The synchronization of multiple processors becomes a 
concern. If you have an 8p and each of them tries to get the zone locks 
for reclaim then we are already in trouble. And given the immaturity
of the handling of cacheline contention in current commodity hardware this 
is likely to result in livelocks and/or starvation on some level.

A bit sparse but limiting the scanning if we cannot do much is certainly 
the right thing to do. The percentage of memory taken up by anonymous 
pages varies depending on the load. HPC applications may consume all of 
memory with anonymous pages. But there the pain is already so bad that 
many users go to huge pages already which bypasses the VM.

Right but I think this looks like a hopeless situation regardless of the 
algorithm if you have a couple of million pages and are trying to free 
one. Now image a series of processors going on the hunt for the few pages 
that can be reclaimed.
