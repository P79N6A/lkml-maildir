Yes, devio.c, proc_bulk():
        if (len1 > PAGE_SIZE)
                return -EINVAL;
Actually it is the max transfer size I can reach.
I guess that to limit the page size can be an impementation
advantage but it may slow-down a bit some userspace driver.
I feel that even if the linux way is to implement the USB
drivers in kernel space a full-featured USB user space access
should be allowed.
