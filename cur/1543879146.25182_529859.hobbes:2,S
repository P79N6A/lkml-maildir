The short answer is that kthreads don't do this so it doesn't matter.
But user programs are NOT broken, currently getppid returns either the 
original parent or init, and a program can identify init. Reparenting to 
another pid would not be easily noted, and as SUS notes, no values are 
reserved to error. So there's no way to check, and no neeed for 
kthreads, I was prematurely paranoid.
Presumably user processes will still be reparented to init so that's not 
an issue. Since there's no atomic signal_parent() the ppid could change 
between getppid() and signal(), but that's never actually been a problem 
AFAIK.
Related: Is there a benefit from having separate queues for original 
children of init and reparented (to init) tasks? Even in a server would 
there be enough to save anything?
