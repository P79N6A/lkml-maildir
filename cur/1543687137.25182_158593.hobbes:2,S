Sorry, by my mistake I can't get reply of this question.
Please answer again, very sorry.
I send some data from ide disk to some PCI device's RAM directly.
At above sentence, 'directly' means that data is not transferred through
RAM.
Data path is only from ide disk controller to PCI device's RAM.
Anyway data can be transferred by PIO.
But DMA method can't operate. Below is error message.
Aug 18 15:08:12 localhost kernel: hdc: dma_timer_expiry: status=0x58 {
DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
Aug 18 15:08:12 localhost kernel: hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
Aug 18 15:08:12 localhost kernel: ide_dmaproc: chipset supported
ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
After this DMA timeout error, data is transferred by PIO.
Do you have similar experience?
I want to send data by DMA method.
What is problem? Kernel? Hardware?
And how can I solve this problem?
Please give me anser or hint, Thanks!
Below is my system spec
CPU
celeron 400
Motherboard
440BX
IDE interface
Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 IDE (rev 1).
HDD
hdc: IC35L040AVVA07-0, ATA DISK drive (Hitachi)
