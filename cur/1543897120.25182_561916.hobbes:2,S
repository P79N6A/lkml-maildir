There is a lot of confusion, actually :)
But as you see in the patch, I added a couple more aops APIs, and
am working toward decoupling it as much as possible. It's pretty
close after the fsblock patch... however:

Block device pagecache (buffer cache) has to be able to accept
attachment of either buffers or blocks for filesystem metadata,
and call into either buffer.c or fsblock.c based on that.
If the page flag is really important, we can do some awful hack
like assuming the first long of the private data is flags, and
those flags will tell us whether the structure is a buffer_head
or fsblock ;) But for now it is just easier to use a page flag.
