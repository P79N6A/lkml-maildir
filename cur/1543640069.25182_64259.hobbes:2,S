Hi.
I am using kernel 2.4.19 untainted, Pentium PC, RedHat 7.3, etc.
I have repeatedly seen this pattern of oops, even under 2.4.18:
updatedb (used by slocate and run by crond daily at 4am) causes
a kernel oops after which many other applications cause oops and core dump.
I have enclosed the ksymoops output from updatedb and also by kswapd
6 hours later. Mozilla repeatedly caused oops after that and I needed
to reboot to send this email.
I would really like to see this fixed: I hate rebooting every few days
and disabling
the slocate cron job is not really desirable either.
