Sorry about the delay, but being Valentine's day and all changes our 
priorities a bit ;)
Anyway, a friend of mine tested the patch and reported that the 
combinations 000 (all comented out), 001 (the first 2 commented out, but 
the last one not) and 110 (...) still hung the debugger. I suppose these 
were all the combinations he tested.
Tonight I'll have more time to test this again and we can probably have 
a more interactive debug session.
In the mean time, just a few more data points. The debugger seems to use 
LinuxThreads and only works with LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1, even on a 
2.6.10 kernel.
If we don't set this, the debugger hangs in a different way. Apparently 
it is waiting on a signal, it has a signal pending that is one of the 
first real-time signals (the ones used by LinuxThreads), but its signal 
mask is blocking it.
Anyway, I thought of trying to attach a strace to the debugger tonight 
to try to see exactly what the debugger is doing. Is this supposed to 
work? Or trying to trace a process that is itself tracing another 
process a no-no and can give unreliable results?
