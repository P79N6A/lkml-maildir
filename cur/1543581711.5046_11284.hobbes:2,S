Hi!,
We have several machines running Supermicro 370DLE motherboad with dual
733MHz Processors.
We are running reiserfs on some partitions.  2 x 9.1GB SCSI HDD and 1 x
18GB SCSI HDD.
Kernel 2.2.18
Every so often the machines freezes, possibly whilst we are rsyncing to
the machine, but it does not
freeze every day.
Error messages copied from the screen:
Freeze 1
kmem_alloc: Bad slab magic (corrupt)
cname=skbuff_head_cache
Freeze 2
unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
00000000
current tss.cr3=140C9000 %cr3-140e9000 *pde=00000000
Opps=0002
Cpu=1
EIP=00/0=[,c0136130>]
EFLAGS=00010246
eax: ebx ecx etc
Process rsync (pid=1728, process nr=90, stackpage=d41d9000)
In both of these the kernel was corrupt on the boot sector and had to
use a floppy to boot. Rerun lilo it is OK.
Thanks
