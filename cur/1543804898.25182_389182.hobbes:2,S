Wow. Well, that's why I put the patch last in the series.
The other 3 don't depend on it at all.
I tend to think that glibc should not be reading this file.
What excuse is there?
In any case, the many existing statically linked executables
do cause trouble. Setuid apps are the ones you'd most want
to protect. Allowing them to read their own files can cause
plenty of trouble; perhaps you remember the XFree86 config
file bug that exposed the content of files that were not meant
to be readable.
On the other hand, these apps are the ones you'd most want
to recompile with modern tools. (PIE executable, stack canary,
no-execute stack flag, etc.)
I'm actually surprised that processes don't always get to read
their own files. If somebody hacks this up, be sure to base it
on the tgid. (or, better, on the struct mm)
