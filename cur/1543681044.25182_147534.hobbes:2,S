soory no no other usb device here. I mean that the internal CF/SD/MMC
reader runs with usb-storage too.

I disable ACPI in bios and boot with noacpi I get the message:
spurious 8259A Interrupt 7
But usb storage seems to work ( the usb-storage found the internal
CF/SD/MMC card reader.
But then the System is frozen. No reaktion from system on attaching the
usb stick or making any keypress. SYSREQ does not work. 
Nothing in the logfiles.
> How about booting with noapic?
I have try this but it will not do :
First try :
booting with noapic :
There were much CPU(0) APIC error's so the System was unusable.
APIC error on CPU0: 40(40)
After disable apic in bios and boot with noapic ext3 can not mount my
filesystem and there is an oops. The oops was not logged so I can't make
an backtrace.
So it seems that the usb-storage problem seems an acpi problem but
without acpi the systems is unusable.
I hope this will help you.
            thx for help
