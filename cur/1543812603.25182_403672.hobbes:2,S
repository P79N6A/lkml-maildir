I thought the decree / consensus was that You Can't Do That.  Yes, some 
people want to, but that doesn't mean we should let them.

Why should it be merged into base then?  If it's in the mainstream kernel, 
it needs to be reasonably solid (which has always been a precondition for 
merging patches, aiui).

There's a big difference between those interfaces that have had a decent 
amount of thought put into them and those which have not.  Take ext2, 
which is a good example as it can still mount a filesystem made back in 
the early '90s today, yet it has undergone a huge amount of change.  What 
was the secret?  The superblock has a few flags for compatible and 
incompatible features.
API design is not rocket science, it just requires effort.  So long as we 
keep beating the drums about how important this is, people will learn and 
we will get better at catching these issues during review.
