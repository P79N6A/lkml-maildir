Hi,
Thanks for the patch.  Unnecessary casts were one of the things 
mentioned when I submitted the patches to the LKML, and therefore I 
suspect most of them have been already fixed (but I will apply your 
patch to check).
I will send revised patches to the LKML soon, most of the issues raised 
by the comments have been fixed, the current delay is being caused by 
the 4GB limit re-work.
Regards
Phillip
