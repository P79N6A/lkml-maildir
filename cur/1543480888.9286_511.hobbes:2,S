From my experience most newbies who come to me for help are stuck on
one of the following places:
dialup networking (chat has got to be replaced)
isa PnP 
sound card 
and occasionally fdisk
Thanks to redhat Xwin install has gotten easier by the release, I've
noticed the number of help requests go down over each RH release. Most of
my advice in this area involves the words "type XConfigurator" and they
(usually) come back and tell me it works now.
Though not foolproof I do know 13 year olds who can install Linux. Mind
you I think this is a poor standard. What we really need is to test this
on a 45 year old that lacks computer experience.  Somehow I allays have
less trouble helping the 13 - 15 age group.
Clearly more work is needed, however it's gotten MUCH easier since the
first time I installed Linux. (although RH 5.2 install doesn't seem to like
either of the 8 mb ram machines I'm currently trying to install on)
I have little doubt that Linux distributions will continue to improve
their installation programs.

As a computer I find your faith in technology amusing.
