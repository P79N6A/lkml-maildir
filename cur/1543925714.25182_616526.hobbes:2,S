This is possible, but tricky. There is no internal kernel data structure
for a UID's home dir. That is parsable at policy load time, so we could
enhance the language so that a rule of "~/.plan" expanded into a special
token that corresponded to some table of user home directories at the
time the policy was loaded. But that is racy, as it becomes invalid if
anyone's home dir moves, or any users are added or removed.
Another way to do it is what JJ posted: enhance the rule language so you
can have one rule for files that you own, and a different rule for files
owned by others. The AppArmor community (well, JJ and I :) are debating
the cost/benefit of this: is the added flexibility worth the added
complexity?
