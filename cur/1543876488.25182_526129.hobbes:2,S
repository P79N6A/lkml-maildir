This patch by itself, definitely: I gathered stats previously simply
measuring the number of calls, and it's comparable to the other calls we
had to patch.
So it's clear that the patch infrastructure needs to cover them.  We can
debate whether we should extend patching to everything as 1/17 does, or
just to mkpte and pteval.
I'd still like to see new microbench stats tho.
Cheers!
Rusty.
