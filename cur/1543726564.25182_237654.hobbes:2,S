Well, most people probably do not want a x86 emulator running random ROMs
in the userspace, either :-)  But unfortunately the world is ugly (at least
these parts of it).
However, point taken.  (Although it will not be easy, since you have to avoid
kernel drivers touching the device until you can run the ROM in userspace.)

In case of the video cards, it is probably the right path to go.
				Have a nice fortnight
