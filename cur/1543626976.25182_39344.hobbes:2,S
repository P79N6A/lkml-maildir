Hi all!
I've got a really big problem with kernel 2.4.18 and 2.4.17 on
an Alpha.
I can compile, install and boot the kernel on my Alpha.
But if I shutdown the machine without shutting down the
system - I know this is crazy, but sometimes this happens...
So if I'm this mad and restart the machine afterwards, I get
a lot of fsck errors 'til the system give up and tell's me,
that I have to check it with fsck myself.
OK, I did so... fsck -y /dev/sda1 -> Works perfectly. After
fsck has corrected more than 1000 errors I'm able to
reboot the machine.
And than: MY SYSTEM IS NO LONGER BOOTABLE. It's totally
currupted...
I never saw the filesystem curruption bug on Intel, but it
sounds like this.
Is this the same bug that was on Intel?
Have I done something wrong?
Are there any alpha-users in this list? :o))))
Greetz, I look forward for answers,
 Oliver
