Well my experience with XFS for about 6 months using 2.6 kernels has
been about as good as my experience with reiserfs 3.6 back when 2.4
was fairly new.
That's why I run ext3.
I don't need my filesystem locking up, leaking memory all over the
place, causing processes to be killed byt the out of memory handler,
etc.  I will stick with what works all the time.
Performance and nifty features are fun, but only when they don't break
your system.
