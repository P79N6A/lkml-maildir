About this one: thanks for suggesting this and being constructive, I'll do 
ASAP (if I don't forget) this for the -bk tree. However, I think that Greg KH 
for the stable tree would prefer a local tested patch rather than a global 
one with possible side effects, right Greg?
Also, I hope this discussion does not count as a vote for the -stable tree 
inclusion (since dropping GCC 2 support in the -stable tree is exactly the 
purpose of this tree, right ;-) ? ).
