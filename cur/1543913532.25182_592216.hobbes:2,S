This is required by the prepare_write/commit_write API. The write_begin
/ write_end API is also a page-based one, but in future, we are looking
at having a more general API but we haven't completely decided on the
form yet. "perform_write" is one proposal you can look for.

This is done, as I said, because of the deadlock issue. While the issue is
more completely fixed in -mm, a special case for kernel memory (eg. nfsd)
is in the latest mainline kernels.

The page boundary doesn't matter so much (well it does for other reasons,
but we've never been good at them...). The segment boundary means that
we aren't able to do block sized writes very well and end up doing a lot of
read-modify-write operations that could be avoided.

prepare_write must be given a locked page.

So you're doing all copy_from_user calls within a prepare_write? Then
you're increasing the chances of deadlock. If not, then you're breaking
the API contract.

OK, that is what used to be done, but the API is broken due to this
deadlock. write_begin/write_end fixes it properly.

No it would be included earlier. The "segment_eq" check should be
allowing kernel writes (nfsd) to write multiple segments. If you have a
patch which changes this significantly, then it would indicate the
existing logic has a problem (or you've got a userspace application doing
the writev, which should be fixed by the write_begin patches in -mm).
