OK. Then someone needs to do the legwork, and add that.
The "_P" version is intended to be inefficient "because the device
can't handle us pushing the limit". Thus a little more because of an
eax reload is unfortunate, but not the end of the world.
Everybody knows (I hope) that outb_p is not intended as an efficient
way to output a byte. So, when possible everybody should be avoiding
it already.

Yes, but by the time Linux boots, we should just start putting OUR
values there. If the BIOS goes up to 0x8f, then Linux could start at
0x90 and continue there. I don't have one of those thingies, so I
don't know what the last value would be that the BIOS leaves there.
