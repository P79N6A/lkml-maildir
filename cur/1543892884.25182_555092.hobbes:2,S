Hi all,
Right now I have "cleanspace" and "cleanpatch" clean up spaces before
tabs, but it does not compress runs of spaces that aren't followed by a tab.
I could make it do that; I was being conservative when I wrote it and
opted for it not to do so, but I wanted to hear if people think it
should (and if so, what should a reasonable threshold be, in addition
for obviously crossing a tab line?  Two spaces?  Three?  Four?  Eight?)
