Hello
I have some strange problems with the bcm4400 driver
Bigger transfers from any other PC to my PC doesnt work (so receiving seams to be the problem)
Very easy to reproduce this problem is, to ping a other pc with packages greater then  approximatly 3000byte (ping -s 3000)
The Other thing is nfs. This also shows this problem very fast. I couldnt copy a file bigger then some bytes from server to my PC. From my PC to the server works without any problems.
I don't know what infos i should give you, and what infos could be usefull. There are no errors or messages in /var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog.
I have activated acpi, but i also have the problem, without it.
Best regards
Hans-Peter Schadler
