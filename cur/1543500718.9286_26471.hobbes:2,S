Any time you make a tree with the same number of nodes less balanced you
increase its average depth.  Layering makes the tree less balanced.
Anyone with balanced tree experience knows that making the tree less
balanced is a major error.  Actually, the math for stating this
correctly is quite complex, and caching makes it more complex.  I don't
have the time to say more than it is generally understood that you don't
want to unbalance trees, and this popular wisdom has a basis, sorry, I
need to go write some code.
