Even easier method - remove the write permission bits from all executable
files, and don't do the unsafe thing of running email/web browsers/other
user-type stuff as user root.
If it still worries you that root can write to files without the 'w' bit
set, modify the capabilities of the system to prevent it (there is a bit
that can be set which will remove this ability for all new processes).
