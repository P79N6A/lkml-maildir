I have an intermittent unblanking problem with a Compaq Evo N800v
laptop, running 2.6.8.1 with xorg x11 6.7.0-2 (Fedora Core 2).  This
occurs from just blanking the screen, I am not shutting the lid.
The screen and backlight correctly turn off after a few minutes.  Most
of the time pressing any key will bring the display back.  On rare
occasions, the backlight comes on but there is no data displayed, just
a blank screen.  Switching back to a text console makes no difference,
nothing is displayed.  Shutting down X and restarting it makes no
difference.  Once the display is gone, the only fix is to reboot the
laptop.
What diagnostics are worth getting for this intermittent problem?  Any
useful card registers that can be dumped?
