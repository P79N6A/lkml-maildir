I need take back previous comment for accepting the patch.
There are several applications that is running with the driver.
And those applications are need to be verified with this patch before merge it to up-stream.
I'm sorry for creating confusion, today.
I'll update my final comment on the patch once all necessary verifications have done.
Thank you,
