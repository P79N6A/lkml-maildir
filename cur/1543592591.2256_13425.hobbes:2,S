	Yes. My fault - badly merged patch in -pre6, actually.
Details:
	* kill_super() gets called without BKL, but doesn't grab BKL around
the calls of ->write_super() and ->put_super()
	* by the time when it calls these methods filesystem is quiet. I.e.
nothing else has a chance to touch its data structures. So actually only
reiserfs (which checks that we hold BKL) had noticed.
	* It _is_ a bug - changing locking rules is for 2.5.
