  I'm not the  maintainer, but I'm pretty sure that there  is no problem in
that specific  code... but I  think you're hitting  another bug in  the 2.4
tree (read below...)

  From  this description  it seems  that you  are hitting  a bug  which was
discussed to death here on the  list. Here's a thread with 143 messages for
you:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=105400721000001&r=5&w=2
  And here are the threads in which a solution was dicussed:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=105519528200001&r=1&w=2
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=105769525800005&r=3&w=2
  Notice, however, that  the patch Chris, Andrea, Jens  and others made for
this  problem is _already_  included in  2.4 (so,  yes, 2.4.22-rc2  has the
fix).
  So, you are  probably hitting the same bug, which was  not fixed 100%. If
you think  that your  test is  very easily reproducible  and can  shed more
light on this  problem, perhaps you should write to  Chris, Andrea and Jens
(with Cc: to the list), and show  them the test. I don't know if they would
be willing to spend more time  on this issue, specially with 2.6 around the
corner... 
  best regards,
