Subject: [PATCH] rcu: remove duplicate CONFIG_RCU_CPU_STALL_DETECTOR
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Impact: remove the old CONFIG_RCU_CPU_STALL_DETECTOR
tree_rcu introduce CONFIG_RCU_CPU_STALL_DETECTOR again.
These two are the same exactly except:
the old one "depends on CLASSIC_RCU"
the new one "depends on CLASSIC_RCU || TREE_RCU"
This patch remove the old one.
