Incidentally, something I noticed today: when using a parallel printer
console, 'Alt-SysRq-T' gave me a complete task list followed by the
entire kernel ring buffer.
I've taken a look at the code in lp.c, sysrq.c, and printk.c, and I
don't see what can be causing it.  Anyone have ideas?
This happened when the machine had locked up for some reason.
Tim.
