For point 1, it would be much nicer to have user processes participate
in memory balancing _before_ getting anywhere near an OOM state.
A nice way is to send SIGDANGER with siginfo saying how much memory the
kernel wants back (or how fast).  Applications that don't know to use
that info, but do have a SIGDANGER handler, will still react just rather
more severely.
