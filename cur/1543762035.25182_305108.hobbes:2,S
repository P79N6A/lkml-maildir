Thinking some more, one thing that is unique in the PPC64
and SPARC64 cases is that we are executing primarily
32-bit tasks and in such cases one PGD maps the entire
address space.
I wonder if the free_pgtables() loops simply aren't
coping well with something like that.
I'm trying to analyze my traces some more.
