I see no kernel version in your post, that would be the first thing
of interest. Next, look at this addressing variable via /proc.
It it is zero, then you are hit by something avoided by the patch
I sketched yesterday evening or so. Otherwise we must look further.
It looks like all your corrupted places are at a multiple of 2^27.
Also, I see that you do e2fsck on a mounted filesystem. Terrible.
