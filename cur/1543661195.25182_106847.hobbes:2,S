See above, maybe I quoted to much. The other exported symbols are 
already extracted by depmod, so it had exactly the information it needs 
and would give more correct warnings.

You have to define a fixed format somewhere anyway, either you have to do 
it for depmod or for modprobe. This only moves the problem around and if 
we already break interfaces, we should look at all the possibilities.
What I'm really missing is an analysis of the problem(s) and a description 
of how the solution solves it. After reading most of the patches I think I 
understand what Rusty is trying to do, but I still think there are better 
solutions, unfortunately Rusty doesn't talk with me anymore :(, if anyone 
else knows what I'm doing wrong, I'd be really happy to know about it.
bye, Roman
