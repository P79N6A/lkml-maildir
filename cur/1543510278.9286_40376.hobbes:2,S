Not before your patch, but now I get:
Linux version 2.3.18ac8 (root@badlands) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #7 Wed Sep 22 12:04:11 EDT 1999
e820:  E820_MAP_NR = 1
Initializing CPU#0
Detected 199433617 Hz processor.
Console: colour VGA+ 80x34
Calibrating delay loop... 398.13 BogoMIPS
memory region: 639k @ 00000000
memory region: 65535k @ 00100000
Memory: 63560k/66556k available (1120k kernel code, 416k reserved, 1356k data, 100k init, 16636k bigmem)
This is an older IBM PC 300GL with a 430VX mobo
sigh... /me wonders what benefits are gained via customized boards/BIOSes that
keeps a company doing things like this
