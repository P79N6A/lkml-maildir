This may be a VM/block/IO scheduler thing.  If the X server is trying to page
some text in and the disk is busy writing some stuff out then yes, the X
server can freeze for some time.
Of course, a ton of work has gone into this problem, and more work continues
to be done.
If your machine has a small amount of memory, or is heavily overcommitted
then it is more likely to happen.
Using the CFQ or AS IO schedulers will help a bit.  And decreasing
/proc/sys/vm/swappiness may help too.
I'd be interested in feedback on the latter.  The default policy of 60% seems
to be about right for the 128M to 256M desktops, but I am running 85% on
larger memory machines so that a bit more stuff gets paged out.
