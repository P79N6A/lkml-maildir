Subject: [patch 6/13] optimise struct page layout
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/7/28/27

Reorganise the members of struct page.
- Place ->flags at the start so the compiler can generate indirect
  addressing rather than indirect+indexed for this commonly-accessed
  field.  Shrinks the kernel by ~100 bytes.
- Keep ->count with ->flags so they have the best chance of
  being in the same cacheline.
