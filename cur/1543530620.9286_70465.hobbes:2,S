I don't think these two are independent at all. Things like tar also need
the key to be stable (incremental backups), and the key they currently use is
ino_t, which is an arithmetic type. The big question is whether restricting
filesystems to 32 / 64bits of key is reasonable or not. If it isn't, then we
have problems both userspace and NFS (<4). The userspace problem could only be
completely solved AFAICS by adding another version of stat which dealt with
opaque keys for inodes. I assume there are no other UN*X-like systems out
there that have done this already? If not, and it's deemed worth doing, we
should try and get some sort of agreement with other vendors. Of course,
there's still the issue of what the "old" API (stat + stat64) would return:
a hash of the key (not unique but stable over umount), or something
even nastier?

Yeuch. The wonders of trying to control access to nameless objects by name :-)

I dimly recall USENET server authors muttering about it, though with a sane
directory layout and an effective dcache I would've thought the win would be
minimal. I don't know how many of unfsd's problems it would solve, either. I
also don't know what the implications of this on the VFS would be. The next
step would be complete implemention of NTFS-like filesystem-as-database: inodes
are records, inode numbers are primary keys, and then (in theory) you can
index on whatever you like. Whether this is actually useful I have no idea. It
certainly doesn't seem very "UNIX-y".
