If we're talking about implementing mutexes as a semaphore, then they
will be identical.  But what's the point of that?  It's a semaphore
which is just called a mutex.
So you might as well just save the patch noise and do nothing instead.
It seems to me that you'll get _exactly_ the same result with a lot
less effort.
