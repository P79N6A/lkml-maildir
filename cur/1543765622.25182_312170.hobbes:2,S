I see--would the following fit your view?
This would be a kernel lock [from the fusyn patch, linux/fulock.h]:
	/** A fulock, mutex usable from the kernel. */
	struct fulock {
	        struct fuqueue fuqueue;
	        struct task_struct *owner;
	        unsigned flags;
	        struct plist olist_node;
	};
This has an in kernel API so you can use it from modules or kernel
code.
And this would be kernel representation of a user space lock [from
linux/fulock_kernel.h]:
	struct ufulock {
	        struct fulock fulock;
	        struct vlocator vlocator;
	        struct page *page;
	};
This is exposed via system calls with fast-path as an option.
This is basically the kernel lock that provides the functionality and
an structure to keep a tab to where the thing is in user space (hash
queues a la futex). The ops are hidden in fulock.fuqueue.ops [fuqueue
is the waitqueue--just for reference, from linux/fuqueue.h].
	/** A fuqueue, a prioritized wait queue usable from kernel space. */
	struct fuqueue {
	        spinlock_t lock;        
	        struct plist wlist;
	        struct fuqueue_ops *ops;
	};
