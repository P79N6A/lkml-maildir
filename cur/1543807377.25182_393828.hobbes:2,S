Generic and chipset specific support are not complementary, they are
mutually exclusive.  Having generic PCI IDE support enabled will prevent
the chipset specific support from working properly.
This is actually a problem in several areas of the kernel (it's the same
for "Generic RTC" vs. the normal RTC) - I don't think the name "Generic"
properly reflects that it will prevent more specific device support from
working.
