You could use the LSB conforming method of writing and installing
an init script:
http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/iniscrptact.html
http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/iniscrptfunc.html
http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/initscrcomconv.html
http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/initsrcinstrm.html
Most of the main distros support this (Fedora, RHEL, SuSE,
Mandriva, Debian, ...). Not to say all of them ship with the
LSB support packages installed by default. Some do some don't.
On Debian I need to do an "apt-get install lsb".
