Hmm... that set_blocksize there must be new in -mm, I don't see
that in mainline yet.  I would guess that bdev_hardsect_size()
would be more appropriate here than hard-coding 512 bytes.  I
don't know the details of the problem being solving by adding
set_blocksize() in there though, so I might be completely wrong.
cheers.
