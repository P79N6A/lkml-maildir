IMHO this should be three patches: "gpiolib", "pxa" and "am300epd".
Well, ...

Is it really spinlock safe in general?  Or only if gpio_cansleep(gpio)
if false for each gpio to get or set?

IMHO a better name is __gpio_set_batch_generic (or
__gpiolib_set_batch_generic?), YMMV.

Sometimes your width parameter is called bitwidth, sometimes width.  I'd
like to have that consistant.
While talking about this parameter.  I don't really like it, because you
can calculate it from bitmask.  In an earlier mail you write:
	bitwidth (needed to iterate and map to chip ngpios) could be
	calculated from bitmask, but that involves iteratively counting
	bits from the mask, so we would have to do 800*600 bit counts.
	Unless, we do ugly things like cache the previous bitwidth/mask
	and compare against the current caller arguments. Given that the
	bitwidth would typically be a fixed value, I believe it is more
	intuitive for the caller to provide it, ...
I think it's easier than that.  bitwidth is just fls(bitmask) which
should be efficient enough not to bother the programmer.  If bitmask is
constant it's even the compiler that does the work here.
BTW, I wonder why the argument to fls has type int and not unsigned.
Best regards,
Uwe
