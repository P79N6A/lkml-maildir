Unsused pte is where *pte == 0.  Basically entries in leaf page table
that does not map anything.  If such a pte ends up mapping a normal page
then  you get a page fault and HW/handler does the right thing (in terms
of purging old entries).

That would be adding too many unconditional purges (which are very
expensive operations) during mmap.  And as we are only talking of
speculative pre-fetches that are done by HW so IMO we should do this as
lazily as possible (only if required).

Tha page_not_present vector in IA-64 for example.

You are right.

Well, at that time the code does not know if the address belong to
hugetlbfile.  The archs that needs those purges in low level code need
them for all (for example) page not present faults.
