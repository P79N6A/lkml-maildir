As far as I know, not being a lawyer, there is no connection between IBM's
patent(s) and the GPL. IBM has the right to license the use of their
patent(s) to whomever they wish for whatever compensation they wish. 
Obviously, all IBM has to do is license Linux. So what's their *real*
problem?

Only if a trade is *necessary*.
