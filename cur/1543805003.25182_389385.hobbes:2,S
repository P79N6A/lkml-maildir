Because the scheduler favors interactive tasks (aka those which spend a
large % of time waiting on external events) and X is only considered
interactive when the mouse is being moved.  When glxgears is running
it's CPU bound and is therefore penalized.

Personally I don't see how we can expect to deliver OSX-caliber
multimedia performance using only generalized heuristics in the
scheduler (other OSes use hooks into the scheduler for multimedia).  At
the very least it seems you need isochronous scheduling and a
multi-threaded X server.
