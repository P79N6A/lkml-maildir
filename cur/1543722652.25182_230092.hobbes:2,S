I wish that you had included me in this discussion.  Can you explain 
exactly what the locking issues with my code were?  We might have been 
able to come up with a better solution than the one you have used which 
places unnecessary restrictions (i.e. no blocking) on the init() 
callbacks which weren't applicable in the code that I provided.  Since 
these callbacks are highly likely to want to allocate dynamic memory 
there is always a chance that they will block and the no blocking 
restriction becomes an unnecessary burden.
