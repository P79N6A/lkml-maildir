Clearly we are talking at cross-purposes here.  I do realize that
spin_lock+spin_unlock have a non-zero cost.
The question is whether or not it is worth taking a lock again (with
that non-zero cost) to achieve the gain of doing the 92-byte memset and
the atomic_set in parallel with other CPUs.  In other words, by locking
and unlocking twice, you reduce the contention on the lock.  Is this,
however, worth the extra cycles and bus traffic?  I don't know.

Taken to its logical conclusion, you are arguing for Linux 2.0.x SMP.
Nobody takes any locks at all, except the BKL at kernel entry points.
Clearly that is suboptimal for contention.
