Does sed tell you who programmed it on startup?
Awk?
Perl?
Groff?
Gcc?
See a pattern here?
I might add that the most-used program I was one of several authors of  
*never* mentioned a single author in the program messages, with the single  
exception that the initials of the author actually compiling the source  
were part of the version string (in an attempt to control "just which  
patch to 7.53 are you talking about?" syndrome). I can't say this ever  
bothered me.
