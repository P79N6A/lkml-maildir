Linus,
I did send a pointer to the cleaned up patch, maybe this wasn't
explicit enough:
  
http://fuse.sourceforge.net/kernel_patches/fuse-2.1-2.6.10-rc2.patch
It's 90k uncompressed so I didnt want to include it inline, but I can
send it privately if you want.

The cruft is the 2.4 code, and it _is_ removed from the patch.
Most of the 2.6 code is the page cache reading and writing.  It's
complicated because of
  - clustered reads with readpages()
  - async writes
Both are non-essential, but both improve performance.
The need to have a special fuse_file_read()/fuse_file_write() comes
from the fact that some filesystems want a 1 to 1 mapping betwen the
read/write syscalls and the read/write operations.  This is a sort of
"direct IO" operating mode.  Again this feature is non-essential, but
isn't the result of unmaintained code.
