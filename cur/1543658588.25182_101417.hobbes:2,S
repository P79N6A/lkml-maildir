I realize this.
The issue is that PF_MEMALLOC can be _cleared_.  In that case, if you
only set PF_MEMALLOC, that check can be false when we want it true.  So
we need a flag that is more persistent.
PF_MEMDIE, which is not cleared on various allocation paths in the VM,
ensures that the check holds true for all OOM'ed tasks.
I thought the same as you, "hey this thing is worthless let us dump it",
and Rik and Andrew told me otherwise.
I am not saying you are wrong, though - I could be very wrong.  But my
point is not what you say above; it is that the flag is needed because
just setting PF_MEMALLOC is insufficient since it can be unset.
