 Indeed.

 The flag is cleared as on every interrupt regardless of the processor's
mode.  It's unfortunate it gets stored nowhere in the real mode, indeed. 
It leads the Intel's official CPU determination code to fail if interrupts
are enabled and one arrives at a wrong time.  I discovered it in mid-90's
and have some diagnostic code somewhere in my archive -- basically raising
the 8254 timer interrupt rate (actually any IRQ suffices, but that's the
easiest to reconfigure) much enough assures any i486+ processor will get
misidentified as an i386 with high enough probability you may actually see
incorrect reports from programs. 
 The discussion may be available from a Usenet archive; I think there is a
statement on the problem somewhere at the www.x86.org site as well.
