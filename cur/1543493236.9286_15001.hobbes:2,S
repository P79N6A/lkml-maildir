  I have a number of machines here I'm running in a small network.  I like
to try and optimize them, but one area's driving me nutz.  The chip sets.
Does anyone know which chipsets a Tyan Tomcat 4 and a dual-P2-asus
would use?  Preferably, can anyone tell me if there's something I can
cat, and exactly how to look at it to know what chipsets are there?
Right now I'm using the standard defaults:
[*]    CMD640 chipset bugfix/support
[ ]      CMD640 enhanced support   
[*]    RZ1000 chipset bugfix/support
[*]    Generic PCI IDE chipset support
[*]      Generic PCI bus-master DMA support
[ ]      Boot off-board chipsets first support
[*]      Use DMA by default when available   
[ ]      OPTi 82C621 chipset enhanced support (EXPERIMENTAL)
[ ]      Tekram TRM290 chipset support (EXPERIMENTAL)      
[ ]      NS87415 chipset support (EXPERIMENTAL)           
[ ]      VIA82C586 chipset support (EXPERIMENTAL)        
[ ]      CMD646 chipset support (EXPERIMENTAL)          
[ ]    Other IDE chipset support                       
Thoughts?
