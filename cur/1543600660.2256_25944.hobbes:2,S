That's fine.  It's a very isolated thing (me enabling IPX.)  I'm guessing
it's a simple oversight in handling the deletion of an interface.  I'll
have to look at the way IP traffic is handled to see if it's just IPX not
MOD_INC_USE_COUNT'ing the driver or something like that.
The obvious fix is to shutdown IPX before removing the card :-)  Another
route would be to have the name remain in existance until the interface
is no longer busy.  Otherwise, the services busying the device cannot be
easily shutdown.
