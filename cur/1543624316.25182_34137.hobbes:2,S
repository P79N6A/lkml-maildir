Hmm.  If such a generic low-level raw device layer were to be
implemented (presumably as the foundation for the block layer), I
expect the interface would be somthing like the cdrom layer, and
would abstract out all the normal things that raw mass-storage
devices can do.
But the minute such a layer is in place, people will begin going
straight to the sub-low-level raw device layers so they can use
all the exciting new extended features of their XP370000 quantum
storage array which needs the special frob-electrons command to
make it work...
