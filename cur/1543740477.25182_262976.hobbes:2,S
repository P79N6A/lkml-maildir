I partially take this back; depending on how it's implemented, you
can get away with only adding it to the list once contention occurs.

How would maintaining priority order make it faster to check for
recursive usage?  You'd be looking for a specific mutex rather than
the highest priority blocker.  You could also check the per-mutex
list of owners (which you'll need to implement PI on rwlocks), to
avoid needing to add to the locks-held list in non-contended cases.
On uniprocessor, one may wish to turn rwlocks into recursive non-rw
mutexes, where recursion checking would use a single owner field.
Also, keeping it in priority order would introduce yet another place
that assumes of a linear priority scheme.  At some point, it may be
desireable to implement other schemes, such as maintaining per-CPU
priorities to deal with inheriting from CPU-bound tasks without
introducing said tasks' priorities on other CPUs.
