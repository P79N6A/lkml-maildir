I've started working on a driver for the Secure Digital Host Controller 
specification. This seems to be used by the majority of the controllers 
found in todays PCs, so this driver would add support for a lot of 
chips. Information is scarce so I do not know if this driver will get 
production ready, but for those of you willing to live dangerously:
