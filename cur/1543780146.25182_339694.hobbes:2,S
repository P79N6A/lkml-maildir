The updated patch, which adds a new bitfield, looks OK to me.
However...
<pedantic>
FWIW, compilers generate AWFUL code for bitfields.  Bitfields are
really tough to do optimally, whereas bit flags ["unsigned int flags &
bitmask"] are the familiar ints and longs that the compiler is well
tuned to optimize.
Additionally, though it is not the case with struct pci_dev, bitfields
cause endian headaches (see the LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD ifdefs).
Bit flags are -far- superior in every case.  Avoid bitfields like the plague.

I wouldn't mind seeing a janitor remove all bitfields from struct pci_dev,
and any other kernel structure that uses the evil constructs.
