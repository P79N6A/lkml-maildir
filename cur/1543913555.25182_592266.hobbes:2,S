Well, I stand corrected on the "platform" term, then.

You'd have so many, it wouldn't be funny.  It would also cause some
headaches for distros, unless one can have an "all platform" kernel or
somesuch.

The "feel" is there because:
1. Comments about how what we do is wrong for the platform bus (i.e.  adding
   the devices and the driver in the same module). Even the documentation
   for platform devices make it quite clear we are abusing it.  There was
   one of those comments in this very thread.
2. The fact that a module that has a number of different devices has to
   register itself a number of times as a driver, if it wants to name the
   devices something different...
