Ok, I've done some tests: 
1. Comparing the safe and unsafe functions
For my minilzo kernel patch, the safe version showed a 7.2% performance
hit. For Nitin's patch, it showed a 3.2% performance hit (but see
below).
Could be a lot worse and I don't object to the removal of the unsafe
version.
2. Comparing Nitin's code with my minilzo based kernel patch.
My kernel patch is about 2.25 times faster at decompression (16725Kb/ms
vs 7399Kb/ms) and fractionally faster at compression (1434kb/ms vs
1490kb/ms). As things stand the performance of Nitin's patch is
therefore unacceptable as that is a significant decompression
performance loss.
These tests are on 32 bit Intel and in userspace but I've found them to
be a pretty good indicator of what happens in the real world and on
other architectures. 
For simplicity I made these tests with some existing code I had around
but its licence is such I can't share it, much to my frustration.
Cheers,
Richard
