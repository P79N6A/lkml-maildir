The actual net effect of all this is blowing away if (nr_swap_pages > 0)
for __GFP_WIRED allocations. Removing those 2 lines (and the one line of
whitespace next to it) will pass the test I observed failure in. It's a
judgment call as to whether it's beneficial in general, as it does
insulate userspace somewhat from needing to wait for slow IO being the
ostensible cause of the allocation failure. RedHat vendor kernels have
removed the check entirely, which may be considered to be evidence of
the approach's viability.

Hmm. That sort of thing is what I had in mind by saying "pinned kernel
allocations". What did it sound like I had in mind?

The timeout semantics are crusty. 10 failures 1s or more apart must be
seen, but with no delay of more than 5s between failures. If the average
delay between attempts more than 1s from the last successful attempt
that incremented the counter was 3s, that would make for a 30s delay
before OOM killing. In the presence of e.g. delays waiting for IO and
so on preventing retries from happening rapidly, 30s is plausible. Also,
it's rather likely that the tasks targeted by the OOM killer are in
state TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and so will never respond to the OOM kill
until whatever they were waiting for happens, which may require (you
guessed it) memory to occur.
I would prefer to migrate away from timeout-based semantics and eliminate
indefinite retry logic and out-of-context reclamation (which is the source
of reclamation failures having no context to which to return errors).
However, this also requires some method of recovering from or insulating
administrators from indefinite retry loops originating from userspace, and
better contexts to which to return failure than syslog daemons.
