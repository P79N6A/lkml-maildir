Thanks for putting this clearly.  It is required for any kind of formal
guarantee.  Let me put this bluntly - no spec, no proof.
I can upgrade a clear description to a sufficiently clear spec but I
need to be educated in the terminology and filled in on the background
here if I am to do that too.
(Sorry)

That's a typical blocking read from a semaphore.  I assume it's
implemented right!  It's fine if indeed the test_and_set is atomic.

OK. Yes, the spinlock is more "classic" in terms of theory.

No - the problem is relating that concept to the code.  The fact that I
can't divine the intention from the code means that it is not
self-evident either, but in any case a formal guarantee of any
property that is to hold of a computer requires the concept to become
bound to cpu states. That abstract binding idea<->variables is what I
need to have set out. Without it, I don't know if "waking" is intended
to be the resource-available concept, or if "count" is.
Since he's got two fields where I have one concept, clearly one of them
is an implementation detail. That's his implementation detail, and so
he has to state what it's supposed to be doing!

Foolproof (relative) is my business. Fast is his.
