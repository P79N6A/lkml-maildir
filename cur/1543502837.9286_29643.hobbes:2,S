Yeah, that's fine.  Should I add something like /proc/this to point to
the current process then?  I don't see immediate uses, but perhaps later
this will be handy.
Anyway, I'm concentrating first on getting signals to work properly...
I'll do the /proc stuff later - I'm only making the change so that it
doesn't screw stuff up to use CLONE_PID.
