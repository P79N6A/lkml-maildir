I don't have much to add but another ack and a "hmm, maybe something
could be done". My prior comments stand. I'd be very much obliged if
you provide a fix for the set_cpus_allowed() issue. I very much rely
upon you now to provide scheduler fixes and optimizations for large
scale and/or NUMA machines these days.
Thanks,
