Hi Mike.
I can accept your other points, but your explanation here has me
completely confused. Can you please clarify?
 >>> The idea is that ALT *HAS* to be pressed down anyways in

Guilty as charged, mainly because I'm concentrating on revision
for some exams I have to sit next week...

Again, where did I say otherwise?

Agreed.

So what you're saying is that the game I was playing the other
day, that uses Alt-ScrollLock to fire a smart bomb, will not be
able to fire the said smart bomb if played with your code enabled
when the user accidentally hits the SysRq key whilst aiming for
the ScrollLock key next to it?

Agreed and understood.

Agreed.

So, instead of seeing ALT-SCRLK as per the first version, we now
see ALT-SYSRQ-SCRLK instead, correct ???
 > SCRLK BREAK     - same as make code
Thus we see ALT-SYSRQ-SCRLK released instead of ALT-SCRLK ???

At which point, ALT-SYSRQ becomes inactive?

I understand that perfectly.

You appear to be deliberately ignoring the scenario I pointed
out, so please advise which of the following will occur in the
given scenario:
 1. (Implied by your comments) The attempted Alt-ScrollLock
    where the SysRq key is accidentally hit will work fine
    with `echo 1` but will silently vanish with `echo 2`.
 2. (Desired behaviour) The attempted Alt-ScrollLock where
    the SysRq key is accidentally hit works fine with both
    `echo 1` and `echo 2` in force.

Have you tried any software that makes use of that oddball
combination?
Also, as I recently discovered, some keyboards don't have a gap
between the SysRq key and the F12 key, so a similar problem could
occur when trying to press Alt-F12. Is that also correctly
handled?

If it deals with the desired problem without causing glitches
when trying to press adjoining keys, I for one could see no
reason to refuse it.
