I think you'll have that problem with any UNDI driver; in either case
I suspect that (a) performance will stink no matter what and (b) it
won't work properly with SMP unless you apply really heavy locking.
The PXE people at Intel really seems enamored with the idea of using
the UNDI stack all the way into the operating system; I don't think
any sane operating system does that (DOS, of course, does, but DOS
isn't a sane operating system.)  If I'm not completely mistaken UNDI
was derived from NDIS 2 or so -- widely considered the crappiest of
all the various specifications for DOS drivers.
