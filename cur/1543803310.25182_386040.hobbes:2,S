Could you please tell me sample modaliases for a number of "common" 
devices (like a PS/2 mouse)?
I ask because earlier (namely, in 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/old/gregkh-all-2.6.15.patch
) 
such modaliases contained commas (",") and comma is not a "trusted" 
character in Udev (see replace_untrusted_chars() in 
udev_utils_string.c). Thus, such modaliases were mangled and didn't work.
