There was some discussion about this sort of thing last week.  The
consensus was that it's better to run the callback against a whole pmd's
worth of ptes, mainly to amortise the callback's cost (a lot).
It was implemented in
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.20/2.6.20-mm1/broken-out/smaps-extract-pmd-walker-from-smaps-code.patch
