I admit that I probably don't understand the system architecture of
where ehea would be used, but would this
cause /sys/class/net/ethX/carrier to be TRUE even if the device has no
carrier?  That seems quite wrong IMHO.  When does ehea not have a
carrier?  And in that case, does sysfs say 1 or 0 for the carrier?
