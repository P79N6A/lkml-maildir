: mounting Amiga RDSK (aka RDB) partitioned devices using CONFIG_AMIGA_PARTITION
: <gives Oops / kernel hang>
: How can I get some debug info logged to disc?
There is not really any need to collect debug info, I think.
If you have a disk image that causes the problem,
then inspection of the code, combined with inspection
of the disk image, will very quickly show what is wrong.
I wouldnt mind seeing such an Amiga disk image.

(don't mail anything, unless it is really small, but
put it up for ftp somewhere; delete all files that are
sensitive; make sure that afterwards the problem still exists)
