we are not /that/ late to not apply trivial cleanups. If my patch breaks 
anything then it's easy enough to fix it. But 'lets clean this up later' 
is bound to be forgotten and puts the onus on the person doing the 
cleanups. You yourself have sent more complex partly-cleanup patches 
upstream just 2 days ago:
