revoke_mapping() is mostly same as munmap(2) except that it preserves the 
vma but makes it VM_REVOKED. This means that if the process tries to 
access the region it will SIGBUS and if it tries to remap the range it 
will get EINVAL.
What we're trying to do here is, we want to make sure no other tasks can 
access the inode once it has been revoked.

So there's no way to raise SIGBUS if the range is being accessed. The 
alternatives are:
  - No support for revoke(2) on NOMMU.
  - If there are shared mappings, always return -ENOENT for revoke(2).
  - If there are shared mappings, immediately raise SIGBUS for those 
    processes that are accessing it.
Making the shared mappings private is not an option because there's no way 
for the process to know that it's mapping is being pulled under it which 
will result in bugs. Hmm.
