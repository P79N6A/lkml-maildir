Their use was broken in the first place - they shouldn't have made
assumptions about the contents of the macro, by writing this like
	RESTORE_CONTEXT "\n\t"	\
	".globl ..."	\
if they really need to make use of the macro. This is similar to
requirements of other (assembly) macros that normally also
don't have a line terminator and hence require the users to
add appropriate line termination after the macro name (and
eventual arguments).
I would even go as far as asking for removing the \n\t on SAVE_CONTEXT
and the left \t on RESTORE_CONTEXT.
