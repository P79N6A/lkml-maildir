That's only a sloppy documentation, obviously it returns a bus
address, not a physical address. Simply the x86 graduate who wrote
it cannot see the difference, that's all. Pay it no mind and
implement it properly, that means copy it from sparc64.
Who reads documentation anyway when we have the source?
