Was this result on UP or SMP kernel ? Preempt or not ?
I think we might play in do_pollfd() and use fget_light()/fput_light() instead 
of fget()/fput() that are somewhat expensive because of atomic inc/dec on SMP.
(I believe that select()/poll() based daemons are mostly non multi-threaded, 
since high performance multi-threaded programs should be using epoll...)
