Currently I booted to test3-mm2 with the bugoff patch, and using the x 
nv drivers and everything in the video dept is cool.  I see by dmesg 
that the vesafb isn't being used so I'll take that out in addition 
the next time I switch to the nvidia drivers.
I might add that test3-mm2 appeared to handle this mornings amanda run 
more like it would have run under 2.4, a pretty nice improvement over 
the bare test3, which appeared to shove amanda to the back of the 
queue most of the time.
From dmesg, snippets:
