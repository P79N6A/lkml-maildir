It is merged into Linus' tree now:
http://www2.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=b61901024776b25ce7b8edc31bb1757c7382a88e
... The only difference is that the changeset in Linus' tree also changes some
whitespace.
Please merge this into 2.6.18.y, 2.6.19.y and 2.6.20.y
Adrian, this should also apply against 2.6.16.y
Thank you,

dvbdev: fix illegal re-usage of fileoperations struct
From: Marcel Siegert <mws@linuxtv.org>
 Arjan van de Ven <arjan@infradead.org> reported an illegal re-usage of the
fileoperations struct
 if more than one dvb device(e.g. frontend) is present. this patch fixes this issue.
 it allocates a new fileoperations struct each time a device is registered and
copies the default
 template fileops.
