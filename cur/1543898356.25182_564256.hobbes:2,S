Is it running with a default (0) nice value?
could you please run the following script when your application is running?
As you have pointed out :
"... In fact, it seems that the longer it runs, the longer it takes to
terminate (towards 5 seconds after running for a couple of minutes
..." ,
please run the script a few times : say, before starting up your
application, 10 sec. after it's got started, 1 minute, a few minute...

then send us the resulting files. TIA,
