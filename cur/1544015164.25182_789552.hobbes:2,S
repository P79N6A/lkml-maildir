Just realized that I forgot to mention that I do also have g_zero sitting on 
top of amd5536udc, so there should at least be a dummy USB device to 
enumerate.

Nope, nothing at all shows up in the logs or the interrupt counts when the 
cable is plugged, neither for the host drivers nor the device drivers. (The 
quickest test I have is to hook the device up to itself - one A port and one B 
port.)
The BIOS is configured "correctly" if the manuals are to be trusted. Here are 
the relevant settings
	OHCI: Enabled
	EHCI: Enabled
	UDC: Enabled
	UOC: Disabled
	Overcurrent reporting: Disabled
	Port 4 assignment: Device

Please pardon my ignorance, but what would be the best way to check if 
these bits are set?
Thanks.
