Hi all. I'm new to this list. My name is Pablo Gil and I write from Spain.
I have noticed that xosview reports double CPU load (it reports 200% at full
load) with kernels 2.3.40 and 2.3.41
I have an uniprocessor PC with an AMD K6-2 300 MHz (600 BogoMIPS) cpu
is there any new feature in these kernels that is making xosview to report
wrong data?
regards
Pablo Gil
