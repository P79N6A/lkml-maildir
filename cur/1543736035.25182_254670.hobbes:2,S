If it hurts, don't do that. It looks like bloat anyway.
Are benchmarks significantly affected if you remove the inline?
If so, simply have a second function:
extern void uninline_foo(void);
...
void uninline_foo(void)
{
        foo();
}

Hey, I argued for INLINE when the static/extern changes
came along. That's the sanest, because one never knows
what the next annoying compiler will demand. Then you
can have one of:
#define INLINE
#define INLINE inline
#define INLINE static inline  // an oxymoron
#define INLINE extern inline  // an oxymoron
#define INLINE __force_inline
#define INLINE __attribute__((always_inline))
#define INLINE _Pragma("inline")
#define INLINE __inline_or_die_you_foul_compiler
#define INLINE _Please inline
