Do you want any output from the enabling of DEBUG, or will doing that
give more info in the other two steps?
Once I get a reply, and once either you release 2.4.1 or Alan releases
-ac4, I'll do that for you (I have a policy of not recompiling the same
kernel twice...I'm just odd that way.  Everybody needs a way to be odd,
and this is mine.  Odd is good).  I like helping people.
Kernels are fun!
