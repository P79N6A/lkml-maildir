While testing an older driver on an -RT kernel (currently using
-V0.7.37-03), I noticed something strange.
The driver was triggering a "sleeping function called from invalid
context" BUG().  It was coming from a case where the driver was doing
a __get_free_page(GFP_ATOMIC) while interrupts were disabled (example
trace below).  I know this is probably real bug and it shouldn't be
allocating memory with interrupts disabled, but shouldn't this be
possible?  Isn't the role of GFP_ATOMIC to say that "this caller
cannot sleep". 
To produce the following trace, I wrote a simple moudle which just has
this as its init_module routine:
        local_irq_disable();
        p = __get_free_page(GFP_ATOMIC);
        local_irq_enable();
And here's the trace:
