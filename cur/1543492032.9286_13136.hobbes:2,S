    "I didn't start it" is a pretty poor excuse. The point is that the subject is
clearly off topic and replying in context to the subject only serves to propagate
the spam not to impede it or even resolve the issue. Please stop.

    I completely agree. I desire this policy being implemented ASAP.

    I don't consider insisting on a right to spam an already over crowded list as
being civil. FWIW, I've received several nasty emails from pro-GNU types who accused
me of being one sided in this debate. To be clear - I took no sides in this
non-issue. If someone posts a message on such an off-topic subject in the future I
hope people will simply control their passions and limit their response to simply
stating the item is offtopic and should be dicussed elsewhere - this is what I did.
That is the only way to stop this nonsense. Barring that, I think the list
moderators should start knocking people off for a good period of time.
    thanx & later,
        Ben Scherrey
