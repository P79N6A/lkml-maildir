  Strange, I was just talking to somebody about compiler 
performance and regression issues and what sort of automation
could be done to do that sort of testing.  
  Since the STP is really a framework and just about any piece
of software and testing environment could be worked into it.
 So I guess you could have two pieces.  One that just ran a bunch
of compile and user level tests and then one that went in and
checked out the compiler on a kernel tree and then ran the
same performance tests that had been run using the "standard"
compiler.  
  Are you stepping forward to integrate this into STP? :-)
