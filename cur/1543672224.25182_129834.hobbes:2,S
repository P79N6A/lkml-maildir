Subject: Re: [PATCH 2.5.68] Convert elan-104nc to remove check_region().

All the request_region() calls in this driver (plus all the now removed
check_region()) calls are commented out because of conflicts with the PIC.
The release_region() call below was NOT commented out.  If the driver
isn't really requsting the region it shouldn't be release it.  So, I
commented it out.
