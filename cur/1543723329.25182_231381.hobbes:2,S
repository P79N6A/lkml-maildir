Hi,
Ben Collins:
> This oops traces back into the scsi stack, right?
Umm ... not that I know of. It basically says
                      sbp2_logout_device+0x13/0x140 [sbp2]
kernel:  [<fb2c49f1>] sbp2_update+0x21/0x80 [sbp2]
No SCSI anywhere (that I can see).
sbp2_update+0x21 points to the instruction after a call to
sbp2_logout_device(), so that matches up. GDB says the error is here:
sbp2.c:1323:	scsi_id->logout_orb->reserved1 = 0x0;
which probably means that either scsi_id or logout_orb is NULL.

So can USB; I have a card reader here which registers a different LUN
per card interface.
