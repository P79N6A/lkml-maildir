Subject: [PATCH]: Fix radeon blanking return value.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

If you'll recall, over a year ago, I pointed out that the current
Radeon driver erroneously returns -EINVAL for valid blanking codes,
here is a link to that thread:
	
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/28/6
No other driver does this, and it confuses the X server into thinking
that the device does not support blanking properly.
As a result I have to switch to a console VC and back to the X server
to unblank the screen, which is rediculious.
I've had to do this for more than 3 years and I'm really tired of this
problem still being around :-)
I looked again and there is simply no reason for the Radeon driver to
return -EINVAL for FB_BLANK_NORMAL.  It claims it wants to do this in
order to convince fbcon to blank in software, right here:
			if (fb_blank(info, blank))
				fbcon_generic_blank(vc, info, blank);
to software blank the screen.  But it only causes that to happen
in the FB_BLANK_NORMAL case.
That makes no sense because the Radeon code does this:
		val |= CRTC_DISPLAY_DIS;
in the FB_BLANK_NORMAL case so should be blanking the hardware, and
there is therefore no reason to SW blank by returning -EINVAL.
Therefore I propose we finally apply the following patch.  No other
fbdev driver does this madness, and as I've shown above there is no
justification for the behavior at all :-)
