Subject: [PATCH 000 of 8] knfsd: Assorted bugfixes for 2.6.22
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following are 8 patches for knfsd and related code that are suitable for
2.6.22.
First two are suitable for -stable: they can cause an oops.
(8 can also cause an oops, but you really need buggy userspace code 
running as root, and it is a larger patch than I like to send to -stable).
Other 6 are less significant bug fixes and cleanups.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
