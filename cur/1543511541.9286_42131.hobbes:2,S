That should be fine infact.
AFIK the only issue apic related is booting an UP kernel on a SMP
hardware. Doing that you won't use IO-APIC to deliver irqs to the only
possible running CPU. It's possible to do that of coruse, but the kernel
is not doing that right now with the UP compile. To use the IO-APIC on a
SMP hardware you'll also have to run an SMP kernel (even if you have only
one CPU plugged-in the SMP motherboard).
