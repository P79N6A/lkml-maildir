See a URL I posted earlier in this thread.  With dumb ATAPI devices we
actually have to wait a bit for BSY to be asserted.  Not only at reset,
but also for every command.

That's quite reasonable.

P.S.  We can probably reduce the msleep(150) sprinkled about the code to
msleep(100), for the dumb-ATAPI-device wait.
