   How do you propose to do this without turning setup.c and friends
   into a #ifdef nightmare ? setup_intel.c, setup_amd.c etc ??
It is possible to contain the mess in header files.  Other
architectures have done this...
You can either macro inline the cpu tests and/or use function
pointers.  The munging in the header files nops it out into
whatever CONFIG_CPUTYPE was chosen if you didn't ask for the
generic build.
Franks a lot,
