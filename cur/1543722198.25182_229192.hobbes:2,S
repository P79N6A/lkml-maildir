Andries, I agree, it's handled inconsistently.  The typical usage would
never notice this since both caps would be either enabled or disabled.
I believe we could actually simplify the overrides to simply:
	if (capable(CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE) || capable(CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH))
		goto ok;
Because this is only MAY_EXEC on directories check.  However, that does
hide the override reasoning, so conservative approach below.  I changed
it just slightly from yours to keep in line with code in vfs_permission.
thanks,
