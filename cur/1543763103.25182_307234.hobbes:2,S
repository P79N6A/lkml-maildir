You want su1, or maybe sudo.

Remember: xmms might be configured to spawn the shell plugin.
I guess there should be a maximum renice value ulimit instead, which would
allow running allmost any user task on a higher nice level, except the
important stuff, with the additional benefit of being able to temporarily
renice some tasks until the more important work is done.
I remember something similar being discussed for realtime tasks, but I don't
remember the outcome.
