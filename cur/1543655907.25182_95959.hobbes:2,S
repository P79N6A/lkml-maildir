Perhaps we have a different idea of "fix".
You want are looking for a patch to modifications you have made to code
I have written.  In the meantime I have been providing working code, and
have been updating that code to work with new hardware.  So a fix is the
working, continuously maintained version of the driver. 
To put an admittedly simplified spin on it, you are saying "I want you
to tell me what I have broken when I changed this", and to continuously
monitor and test your changes, made for unknown reasons on a very
divergent source base.

I can point to specific instances.  Just looking at the drivers in the
kernel, it is clear that this has happened.

I think that these two statements fit well together.

But it existed before, and was discarded!
Yes, the kernel is now _returning_ to a stable state while making
improvements.  But there was a period of time when interface stability
and detailed correctness was thrown away in favor of many inexperienced
people quickly and repeatedly restructuring interfaces without
understanding the underlying requirements.
I could mention VM, but I'll go back to one that had a very large direct
impacted on me: CardBus.  CardBus is a difficult case of hot-swap PCI --
the device can go away without warning, and it's usually implemented on
machines where suspend and resume must work correctly.  We had perhaps
the best operational implementation in the industry, and I had written
about half of the CardBus drivers.  Yet my proven interface
implementation was completely discarded in favor one that needed to be
repeatedly changed as the requirements were slowly understood.

Yup, that is just what I was talking about.  Let me continue: 
The result is that today other systems now have progressed to a great
implementation of suspend/resume, while Linux distributions now default
to unloading and reloading drivers to avoid various suspend bugs.  And
when the driver cannot be unloaded because some part of the networking
stack is holding the interface, things go horribly wrong...
You might be able to naysay the individual details, but the end
technical result is clear.

Or perhaps recognizing that when someone that has been a significant,
continuous contributer since the early days of Linux says "this is
screwed up", they might have a point.  When Linux suddenly had thousands
of people wanting to submit patches, that didn't means that there were
more people that could understand, implement and maintain complex
systems.
