No, actually, it wouldn't.  Take it from someone who has actually
looked at the code with an eye to doing this.
Replacing static structures by dynamic ones for an architecture which
doesn't yet exist is NOT a good idea.

Sure, if they were stupid they'd do it this way.
If (when) an architecture has hotpluggable CPUs and NUMA
characteristics, they probably will have fixed CPU *slots*, and number
CPUs based on what slot they are in.  Since the slots don't move, all
your fancy dynamic logic will be wasted.
When someone really has dynamic hotplug CPU capability with variable
attributes, *they* can code up the dynamic hierarchy.  Because *they*
can actually test it!

Crap.  When all the fixed per-cpu arrays have been removed from the
kernel, come back and talk about instantiation and location of
arbitrary CPUS.
You're way overdesigning: have you been sharing food with the AIX guys?
Cheers!
Rusty.
