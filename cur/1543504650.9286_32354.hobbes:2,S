Hi,
  today, during compilation of ncpfs, my Motorola Powerstack box emited
these messages (and died, of course):
_spin_lock(c0128494) NIP c0012cd8 holder: cpu0 pc c00123a0
_spin_lock(c0128494) NIP c0012614 holder: cpu0 pc c00123a0
_spin_lock(c0128494) NIP c0012614 holder: cpu0 pc c00123a0
...
c0128494 = runqueue_lock
c0012bfc = schedule (for first NIP)
c00125e8 = wake_up_process (for second and subsequent NIP)
c0012318 = reschedule_idle (for pc)
CPU/Machine specific config is CONFIG_PPC, CONFIG_6xx, CONFIG_PREP,
CONFIG_SMP, CONFIG_MACH_SPECIFIC, ...
Machine is tftp booted, without HDD, everything runs over nfs.
/proc/cpuinfo says:
processor : 0
cpu : 604
clock : ???
revision : 3.4
bogomips : 266.24
total bogomips : 266.24
zero pages : total 0 (0kb) current: 0 (0kb) hits: 0/113 (0%)
machine : PReP Powerstack (Series E)
L2 : 512Kb,parity disabled SRAM:synchronous,pipelined,no parity
           ^^^^^^ :-( And why PPCBug says 512KB, parity enabled ?
As all accesses to runqueue_lock are done through spin_lock_irq or
spin_lock_irqsave, I have no idea, how this could happen except that
__cli() does not work on my CPU :-( If someone is interested, I'd put
my gzipped vmlinux at 
ftp://vana.vc.cvut.cz/private/ppc/vmlinux.gz.
As this machine is otherwise turned off, I can test anything on that
machine (but it took about 8 hrs to die) (I'll try some 2.3.x kernel
after I get it to compile; btw, I had to apply this patch to get
2.2.11pre4 to compile for my PReP). My Intel boxes running this kernel
do not suffer from this problem.
                                        Best regards,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
