Hello. 2.4.21-rc could not start DMA at boot time on
my system, but hdparm could turn it on afterwards. Now
with 2.4.22, nothing will turn on DMA; using hdparm
locks the machine immediately.
The machine in question is an DS10 Alphaserver, Ali
M5229 rev c0 IDE controller. Has 2.4.23-pre made any
fixes for this device?
Thanks in advance,
jasonp
