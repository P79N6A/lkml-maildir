Hi there, 
Was there ever any resolution to this thread? I'm running a bunch of Compaq DL-360's which seem to work fine on the 2.2.19pre series. As soon as I go to 2.2.19, networking doesn't work. Machines are spec'd as follows:
2 x P3-933
1.4GB RAM
Compaq RLO card
Compaq Smart2 Array Controller
2 x EtherExpress Pro onboard
2 x EtherExpress Pro PCI (the dual port server adapter from Intel)
Caveat: whenever I run `ifconfig device down` the machine locks up completely. 
Willing to give any information necessary in exchange for working kernel :) Any takers? Tell me what you guys need. 
Rgds,
