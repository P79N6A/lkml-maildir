For what it's worth: I tried this some time ago (with an ISA network
card), but it failed. The system froze immediately after I inserted the
card, so I assume the bus wasn't amused by the whole operation (fyi: the 
system was an old Acer 80486; plain ISA, no VLB or some such thing). Same
thing when I "hot-removed" a card (with the appropriate drivers
having been unloaded prior to the operation).
Regards,
Daniel
