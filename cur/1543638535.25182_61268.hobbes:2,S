Yes, I agree.
It appears that Juan Navarro, the primary author behind the Rice
project, is working on breaking down the superpage benefits they
observed.  That would tell us how much benefit is due to page-coloring
and how much is due to TLB effects.  Here in our lab, we do have some
(weak) empirical evidence that some of the SPECint benchmarks benefit
primarily from page-coloring, but clearly there are others that are
TLB limited.
