Actually, it should bite less and less, because ammount of memory
actually used does not seem to grow as fast as ammount of memory
available. On 4MB machine, I could imagine kernel using >2MB memory
and "half-memory-free" trick not working at all. On 1GB
machine... well kernel will never use >512MB of memory, so we are safe.

That would mean rewriting half of kernel.

Attempts to load all the binaries into memory. Poor man's "make
machine responsive after swsusp".
