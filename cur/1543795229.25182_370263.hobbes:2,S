Those are the wrong ways of doing this in userspace.  There are right
ways.  For instance, tag the binary at link time "single-threaded". 
Use dynamic linking and the existing hwcap mechanism to select
single-threaded libraries instead of the default ones.  Your
single-threaded applications will no longer mmap the same copy of glibc
as your multi-threaded applications; this does make caching mildly less
effective but only if you have a single-threaded app and a
multi-threaded one fighting for CPU time.

Glibc does not do this to the best of my knowledge.  It does select
different code paths in various places based on the presence of
multiple threads, but that's for cancellation, not for locking.

This is also a trivially solvable problem in userspace; you make the
dynamic linker enforce consistency of the tags.

The number of userspace libraries that use atomic operations is, in
practice, quite small.

By buying new hardware and only caring about people using the magic
architecture.  No thanks.
Maybe I'll implement this some weekend.
