Not really, because perhaps your application doesn't want to interleave 
over all nodes.  I suggested NODE_MASK_ALL as the way to get access to all 
the memory you are allowed, but it's certainly plausible that an 
application could request to interleave only over a subset.  That's the 
entire reason set_mempolicy(MPOL_INTERLEAVE) takes a nodemask anyway right 
now instead of just using task->mems_allowed on each allocation.
