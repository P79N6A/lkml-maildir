hy
I got an error by compiling a kernel. I tried 2.4.x and 2.6.x, but it's
no difference, because of that I thought it must be a problem with gcc
or glibc and I recompiled them.
that's one try with 2.6.4:
  CLEAN   scripts
  RM  $(CLEAN_FILES)
  HOSTCC  scripts/fixdep
  HOSTCC  scripts/split-include
  HOSTCC  scripts/conmakehash
  HOSTCC  scripts/docproc
  HOSTCC  scripts/kallsyms
  CC      scripts/empty.o
  HOSTCC  scripts/mk_elfconfig
  MKELF   scripts/elfconfig.h
  HOSTCC  scripts/file2alias.o
  HOSTCC  scripts/modpost.o
  HOSTCC  scripts/sumversion.o
  HOSTLD  scripts/modpost
  HOSTCC  scripts/pnmtologo
  HOSTCC  scripts/bin2c
  SPLIT   include/linux/autoconf.h -> include/config/*
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s
