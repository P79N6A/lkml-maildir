As Linus initially said, there is the possibility of releasing a bug-fix 
patch 2.6.8.2 *after* 2.6.9 has been released. This can make things very 
confusing when patch-2.6.9 is against 2.6.8.1 and not 2.6.8.2 (or 
2.6.8). So if we use a rule of always patching against the first x.y.Z 
release (and not the last x.y.z.W by the time the new x.y.Z is released) 
we can assure consistence in the patch management.
