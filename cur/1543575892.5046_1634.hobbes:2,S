	I've had similar problems with previous kernels, altough not at
	the same situation.
	If I try to touch a file which is on NFS mounted directory,
	I get "Permission denied" despite group I belong to has full
	access to this file. I can edit and remove the file with no
	problems, but touch doesn't work.
	This is rather tricky situation, as compiling code gets quite
	difficult for this group, as only the owned can touch the file
	despite the effective permissions on file (and previous directories).
