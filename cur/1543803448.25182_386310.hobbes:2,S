Why not implement this via xattr framework and the "system." 
namespace there? I would suggest "system.posix_capabilties" for this.
That way you can reduce your infrastructure, take advantage
of caching features, have user space tools for viewing and changing 
this and resize2fs works for it now or soon.
What do you think?
