As I responded earlier here
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0711.3/2348.html
This interface cannot be supported cleanly with cpuidle. The cleanest
way to do this is to go through latency interfaces. We have changed all
in kernel drivers to use this new interface. The issue here is, I
removed this sysfs interface without depracting it. We can call it a
regression and we can add it back for the moment. But, this will go from
sysfs sooner or later and latency interface has to be used in future.
And Mark earlier responded in this thread saying he is OK with adding
something in the kernel to get this working, That is the reason I
suggested the above option.
As I saw it 6 weeks back, max_cstate option works as a boot parameter. I
did not see anyone else (apart from Mark) saying they are depending on
this sysfs interface to change max_cstate at run time and Mark said he
can do with the kernel change if possible. Please let me know if you
think this interface is a must fix for .24. I will send a minimal patch
to add it back for .24 for !CPU_IDLE case.
Thanks,
