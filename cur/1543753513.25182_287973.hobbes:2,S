You must never execute `make install` or `make modules_install` without
the explicit action of the operator! To do so could (will) result
in an un-bootable system. I can't imagine what somebody would be
thinking to propose an automatic install. Whoever proposed this
must have lots of time and little knowledge. They are going to
be reinstalling everything from the distribution CD as a hobby.
