Symptom is that the system shuts down normally and completely, it just does 
not power off. Here are the last messages on the console:
Will now halt.

sd 1:0:0:0: [sdb] Stopping disk

The system does not respond to that anymore.

Nothing. Only USB kbd/mouse.
Note that I've had this issue before with this box:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6879
Somehow it disappeared when I pulled the extra video card that came with the 
system (no decent driver for it, so no loss). Since then the system has 
always powered off completely reliably.
This time it is a clear and reproducible regression. If we can solve this 
one we might get a better handle on #6879 too.
