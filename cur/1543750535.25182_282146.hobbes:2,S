Interesting!

Well read's also go through the pagecache, so you "suffer" from the same caching 
issue.

Its a bit more complicated than that because requests will be often shared, and 
its not always the process who initiates the request who actually perform it.
For example writes are often performed by pdflush (the flushing daemon) and not 
the process(es) which initiated them.
Another thing is that on a real system you will have a _huge_ amount of statistical data.

Linux Trace Toolkit can give you detailed per-process statistics. You should
take a look at it

Good luck!
