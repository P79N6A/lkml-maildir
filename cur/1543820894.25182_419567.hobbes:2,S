Yes, I was joking.

It would, and it pretty much does right now, in that we test -mm
(OK, we don't run sparse, but that's easy to fix). What I was trying to
do was take the burden off Andrew for handling the testing of every
single patch, which means getting the developer to deal with it.
Personally, I don't think "please email your patch in for automated
testing" is too much to ask from them.
It'd be easy to make the automated tester forward it to Andrew or
whatever, if it passed the tests.
