Blah. That's just your own made-up explanation of what you think "const"
should mean. It has no logical background or any basis in the C language.
"const" has nothing to do with "logical state".  It has one meaning, and 
one meaning only: the compiler should complain if that particular type is 
used to do a write access.
It says nothing at all about the "logical state of the object". It cannot, 
since a single object can - and does - have multiple pointers to it.
So your standpoint not only has no relevant background to it, it's also 
not even logically consistent.
