Right now we're publishing a quilt-able tarball.

http://elinux.org/Linux_Tiny
 page.
Note that some broken patches are kept around
in the patches/tiny directory, but commented
out in the series file, in case someone
wants to un-bitrot them.

Yes, very much so.  These patches have been
showing up in CE products, and this is part
of an overall effort to dust them off, test
them, and move them upstream.
