So, Oray's patch has two things in it, it looks like.  The basic
re-porting to 2.6 APIs, and support for the EON8260.  The EON8260
changes should be a bit cleaner to redo after the patch I sent goes in
as some of the other cleanups will help there.  But I'd also like to see
the full EON8260 changes :)  The 2.6 API parts look close, but I went
and expanded a good bit more on them.
I'd like to drop Oray's patch for now, and have the EON8260 work be
resubmitted to lkml/linuxppc-embedded@ozlabs.org.
