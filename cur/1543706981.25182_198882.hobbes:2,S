Were there changes to the VM?
> How come?
I'm not exactly sure either. But this is what I suspected:
The VM wants to write out some pages. dm-crypt wants to allocate buffers
and starts digging into the reservers because PF_MEMALLOC is set which
causes some sort of low-memory condition.
If PF_MEMALLOC is dropped here the VM can just drop some cache pages in
order to allocate buffers.
If there wasn't a lot of free (unused) memory the machine often started
writing out data when I tried to write a lot of data using dd. The
seeking killed performance, just for the first seconds though.
It's not really important, I can drop that.

Right...

Right again. I changed that several times. It shouldn't happen that
schedule returns but there's not data available, but ok. I changed the
while to an if and call kcryptd_get_bios after schedule().

For thread termination, that's what kthread does. The other kthread
users are doing this too. I changed the for(;;) back to a while
(!signal_pending(current)) since I killed the inner while loop.

Huh? Why that? This is the path for reads.

Ok. :)
