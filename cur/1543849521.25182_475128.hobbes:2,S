This is a pretty ugly-looking patch.

starting to see a pattern here?
If we're going to do this then a helper macro build_check_irq_flags() would
help clean things up.  It will also allow us to centralise the
warning-vs-error policy decision.
I'm not sure that we need both, do we?  If it spits a warning then it'll
get fixed soon enough.
