No. Because then you might end up waiting forever for the _opposite_ 
reason, namely that the hardware was so fast that you never saw it busy.

Oh, well. It was such a good theory, especially as it works fine with ACPI 
off (if I understood your report correctly), so some other state is what 
seems to bring it on.

If the udelay() didn't work, then this one isn't worth worryign about 
either. Back to the drawing board.
