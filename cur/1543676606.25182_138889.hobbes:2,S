Hi,
Is it possible to completely disable AT/PS2 keyboard support
in 2.4 or is this still needed when I only use a USB keyboard?
I am currently getting dozens of keyboard messages:
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 272
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 272
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 272
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 272
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 272
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 272
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 272
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 272
I am not sure if the comes from the USB keyboard or from
the non-connected PS2 port.
Thanks,
Jurgen
