I have a number of PowerEdge 2550 servers.  All are setup with serial
console on ttyS0 @ 9600.  One group uses a (old) Portmaster device for console
access, the other group uses a Cyclades device.  Only those servers
using the Portmaster device exhibit the garbage problem.  The Cyclades
group never displays garbage on boot.
