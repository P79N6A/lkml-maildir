We can, of course, discuss terminology, yet the problem remains the same.

It assures against key revovery through chosen plain text attacks. As written 
before, the purpose of this attack is not to break encryption, but to prove 
the existence of a file *known to* and *prepared by* the attacker.  
The exploit generates a rather simple bit pattern with a size of 1024 bytes.  
When this pattern - the watermark - is encrypted, dm-crypt's output has some  
special properties - independent of cipher or key size.  
For example, encoding nr. 1, always produces a cyphertext block, where bytes  
0-15 are equal to bytes 512-523.  
If you cannot believe this, please try yourself. I did so a few hours ago.  
On dm-crypt's mailing list, I have given a description how this can be refined  
easily to improve reliability of detection and determine a file's layout on 
the encrypted volume.
