Hi Android
                        IPC is my last resort. The reason is that, my present
project is to convert a present software to run in beowlf. I am using Mosix
which enables me to parralize the software through forking. The present
software is highly data oriented and highly  complicated. If all the processes
manipulates the data in the same memory area, I need not look into IPC.
Moreover there is less need for synchronisation since the data are readonly.
The memory mapping in  different systems are done by Mosix. It somehow enables
me to use all the memory in different systems as if they are of single one

1: P1 and P2 have different physical areas of memory. This is how 
protection works.
2: Why do they need to share the same memory? You can have your second
process
communicate with your first process through IPC.
3: Linux supports threading if you include the thread library, and use the 
appropriate
threading process calls.
Another thing you can do is have a common space on the hard drive. It's not 
as fast as RAM,
but it's one solution.
