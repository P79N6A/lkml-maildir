No real time requirements should certainly be the case.

Its all relative - the modulator is very simple compared to the demodulator.
If you aim to have most output generated in user space, and some fudged
underflow fill in generated in the kernel, how will you make the echo
cancellor function reliably? Are you expecting the kernel to feed back its
output stream to the demodulator as it feeds the received stream? If the
output stream can underrun, its more likely to happen during the initial
training period, as the machine is working harder. Just letting the echo
cancellor hiccup during the transmit underrun might be a poor solution, as it
may screw up convergence. You could relegate the whole training process to
the kernel, but that puts more bloat in the kernel.

Remember V34 is fairly fussy about the characteristics of the A/D and D/A
converters. A lot of sound cards may not function very well in this role.
Weird phase effects in some converters really screw up the dynamic
performance of the echo cancellor. The same phase effects don't have much
effect on the actual demod process, as this dynamically adapts well to such
effects. Still, I guess many sound cards will work OK.
