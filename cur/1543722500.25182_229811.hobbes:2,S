No, I'm not sure. Especially, I don't find whether hotremovable
attribute is necessary or not in the mem_section yet.

It might be OK. But there might be some other influence by it 
(for example, new lock will be necessary in alloc_pages()...).
I think measurement is necessary to find which implementation
is the fastest. If I will have a time, I would like to try it.

No, I don't have it (at least now).
Base of my patches is Iwamoto-san's patch which is for 2.6.5.
But Dave-san's patch is for linux-2.6.5-mm. So, I had to change
Dave-san's patch for it.
And, other difference thing is about mem_map.
Dave-san's patch divides virtual address of mem_map per mem_section.
But it is cause of increasing steps at 'buddy allocator' like this.
  - buddy1 = base + (page_idx ^ -mask);
  - buddy2 = base + page_idx;
  + buddy1 = pfn_to_page(base + (page_idx ^ -mask);
  + buddy2 = pfn_to_page(base + page_idx);
So, I would like to try contiguous virtual mem_map yet,
if it is possible.

I don't think I understand your idea at this point.
If booked pages remain in free_list, page allocator has to
search many pages which include booked pages.
remove_from_reelist() is to avoid this.
Thank you for your responce.
Bye.
