Yes, the app will take the cache hits when accessing the data. However,
the fact remains that if there is a copy in the receive path, you
require and additional 3x memory BW (which is very significant at these
high rates and most likely the bottleneck for most current systems)...
and somebody always has to take the cache miss be it the copy_to_user or
the app.

Yes, RDMA support is there... but we could make it better and easier to
use. We have a problem today with port sharing and there was a proposal
to address the issue by tighter integration (see the beginning of the
thread) but the proposal got shot down immediately... because it is RDMA
and not for technical reasons. I believe this email threads shows in
detail how RDMA (a network technology) is treated as bastard child by
the network folks, well at least by one of them.

By no means did I want to imply that others do bad work; are you
referring to me using TSO implementation issues as an example? - If so,
let me clarify: I understand that the TSO implementation took some time
to get right. What I was referring to is that TSO(/LRO) have their own
issues, some eluded to by Roland and me. In fact, customers working on
the LSR couldn't use TSO due to the burstiness it introduces and had to
fall-back to our fine grained packet scheduling done in the offload
device. I am for variety, let us support new technologies that solve
real problems (lots of folks are buying this stuff for a reason) instead
of the 'ah, its brain-dead and has no future' attitude... there is
precedence for offloading the host CPUs: have a look at graphics.
Graphics used to be done by the host CPU and now we have dedicated
graphics adapters that do a much better job... so, why is it so
farfetched that offload devices can do a better job at a data-flow
problem?
