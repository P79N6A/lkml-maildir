I fixed by patch at 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=117783233918191&w=2.
Later on, someone found if CONFIG_ACPI=n, there is a compilation error. Then,
I sent out a new patch to fix the compilation error, but another guy wants
AER driver support although CONFIG_ACPI=n. He sent out the 3rd patch to fix the
compilation error and enables AER driver when CONFIG_ACPI=n.
So pls. apply 2 patches.
1) 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=117783233918191&w=2;
2) 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm-commits&m=118046936720790&w=2
When patch 2 is applied to stable kernel 2.6.21.3, there is a fuzz warning.
It doesn't matter.
Sorry for replying so late.
