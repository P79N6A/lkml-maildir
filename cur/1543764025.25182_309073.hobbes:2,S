 Hi, 
Thanks for the mail.
May be I didn't put my question correctly.
On 2.4.21 based kernels /proc has got hidden directories which has got the
thread related statistics.
1) /proc/pid reflects resource usage of the process
2) /proc/.pid  (I Was referring to this as a thread ID). Kernel stores
thread resource utilization under this directory.
My question was resource utilization (say cpu utilization) statistics under
/proc/pid doesn't include resource utilization of threads which that process
has created.
May be this is specific to Red Hat AS 3.0 only. I will check it.
My second part of question was:
On 2.6 kernels, we have  /proc/<tgid>/task/xxx 
My question is /proc/<tgid> stats reflect resource utilization of the
threads it has created? 
Or do they only report resource utilization of a process with <tgid> as the
pid? 
Once again thanks for your reply and time.
Thanks & Best Regards,
Amanulla

2.4 kernels do not have /proc/.tid.
Some vendor kernels might, if you ahve problems with such kernels you
are much better of contacting the vendor of such a kernel instead.
