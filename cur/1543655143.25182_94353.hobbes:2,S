Thanks to lots of feedback from users in the last months I fixed all
known vm bugs todate that can be reproduced on those big machines.
They're all included in my tree and in the current UL/SuSE releases.
Over time I should have posted all of them to the kernel list in one way
or another.  The most critical ones are now pending for merging in
2.4.21pre. So in the meantime you want to try to reproduce on top of
2.4.20aa1 or the UL kernel and (unless your problem is a tape driver bug ;)
I'm pretty sure it will fix the problems on your big machine.
