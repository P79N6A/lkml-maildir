I assume you are talking about position independant code?  On the x86,
the only instructions that can use IP-relative addressing are branch
instructions.  This asm fragment shows how it's done:
	call 1f
1:	popl %ebx
	addl $(GOT - 1b), %ebx
If the Vax has better support for IP-relative addressing, this may be
easier.  On recent x86 procesors, the above code will screw up the
call/return cache (branch prediction) and cause performance penalties.
