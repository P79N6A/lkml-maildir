It is a problem generally, but happily not in my case 
because at least one of my networks has this overlapping IP area behind a router. 
More precisely, one network almost entirely stands behind a router. 
I do not need any ARP for IPs those I want to remap.

May be I do not understand what means "some sort of VPN or Bridge functionality", 
but any solution requiring an extra soft on the client side would be inadequate 
and I will not take such proposals into account. 
My server must accept pure IP from both sides. 
I am not willing to set up packet forwarding, GRE, nor any another "advanced technique". 
Only one simple thing is required: to shift a block of IPs at one interface.
