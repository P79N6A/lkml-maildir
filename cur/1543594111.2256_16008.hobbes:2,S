Hi Albert,
  yeah I'll be worring about this one too in time. Two birds with one stone
wouldn't be a bad thing. Hopefully it doesn't translate into needing a
significantly larger stone.

Heh.... PHB==Primary Host Bridge  ... but I'll be sure to pass the word onto my
PHB that there's a used greyhound sale... <bah-bum-bum-tshhh>
Anyway, it really is a new id, at least for the implementation on this box. So
PHB0 could have 256 buses, and PHB1 could have 10 buses, PHB2 could have ....
you get the idea.
Hot plug would still have the problem in that it'd have 256 bus numbers in the
namespace of a PHB to manage. Hot plug under a different PHB would have another
256 to play with.

Tom
