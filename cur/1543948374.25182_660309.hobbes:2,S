Hm.  After rummaging around some more in both kernel and userland, I
think this patchlet is not only functional, but  (random accident)
technically correct.  What the heck, let's see if it flies...
snippet from userland:
/*
 * Return the residual DMA count for last command.
 * If this count is < 0, then a DMA overrun occured.
 */
EXPORT int
scg_getresid(scgp)
	SCSI	*scgp;
{
	return (scgp->scmd->resid);
}
This function is used all over the place in cdrecord to determine
transfer size.
(patchlet takes wing, and... goes splat?)
 
Fix CD burning regression introduced by
6b00769fe1502b4ad97bb327ef7ac971b208bfb5.  raw_data_len must be updated
to reflect residual data upon IO completion because it is used by
blk_complete_sghdr_rq() to set hdr->resid which eventually becomes
visible to userland.
