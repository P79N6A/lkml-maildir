I have a few observations, but no solution either:
- if root tells a device to suspend, it shall do so
- the issues of manual & automatic suspend and remote wakeup are orthogonal
- there should be a common API for all devices
- there's no direct connection between power save and open()
The question when a device is in use is far from trivial.
