I'll confess that I've never understood what "classzone" _means_.  Is it "a
zone from amongst several classes" or what?
If it was "zone_class" then it might mean "a particular classification of
zones".  Maybe that's what you meant?
I think a lot of other mm hackers share my confusion, which is why
"classzone" has been trickling away.  But yeah, we haven't been replacing it
with anything very useful.
