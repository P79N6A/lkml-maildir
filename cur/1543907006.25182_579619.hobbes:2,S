I've just been reviewing these patches and have spotted a possible
error in the file arch/ia64/kernel/time.c in that the scope of the
#ifdef on CONFIG_TIME_INTERPOLATION seems to have grown quite a lot
since 2.2.23-rc1-rt7.  It used to chop out one if statement and now it
chops out half the file.
Is it correct?
Peter
