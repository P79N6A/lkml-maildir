Hi,
 I use select( ) function of socket programming on linux. After this function, 
I try to print the return value of select( ) function out. But there is no 
return value coming out, even no any error out. So I do not know what's wrong 
with this function. If I incorrectly used this function, some errors would 
come out. But no any error comes out. Can anybody help me.
 Thank in advance!
 king regards
