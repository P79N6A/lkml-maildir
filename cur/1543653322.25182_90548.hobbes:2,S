Hi,
I tried getting USB audio to work with Apple's USB speakers on Linux
2.4.17.  When I tried to access the audio device, the USB module would
crash.  The USB system appears to properly identify the speakers and their
capabilities.
I've done searching on the Internet and I can't find anyone else who's
tried this recently.  Is this a known problem with USB audio and recent
Linux 2.4 releases?
If this is a known problem, I'd be happy to look into it and try to
(possibly) fix it.  Any pointers would be appreciated.
Thanks!
Erik.
