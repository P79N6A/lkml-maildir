In which case the rest of that line that read:
	it has the first possible of these types ["in which its value
	can be represented" -- from omitted]: int, unsigned int, long
	int, unsigned long int.
...kicks in.

Read that line again. This would only happen if the platform has no
unsigned 32 bit integer whatsoever. If you can point out one of those to
me that Linux runs on, then I'll concede the point. On any other
platform, the constant oct/hex int promotion rules will walk it up to a
32-bit unsigned before it hits the larger types.
