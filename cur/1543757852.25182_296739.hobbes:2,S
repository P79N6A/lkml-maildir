My turn to say uglee.
Firstly, get_user_inatomic is the wrong name.
"inatomic" in __copy_from_user_inatomic means it's called inside a
non-premptable region (in atomic...).
Your macro get_user_inatomic is _not_ called inside a
non-preemptable region, so it shouldn't be called "inatomic".
(A better name is get_user_no_paging).
Secondly, does this _one_ use (it's not likely to be used elsewhere)
justify copying & pasting the same code into every asm-*/uaccess,
especially when the code is not in any way arch-specific?
I suggest putting it into futex.c, and make it an inline function
which takes "u32 __user *".
