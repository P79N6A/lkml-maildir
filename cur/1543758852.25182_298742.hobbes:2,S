I think initialising the backlight driver after the core of the driver 
that implements the GPIO is the right thing.  The backlight_device 
framework includes a notifier chain so that the video driver can take 
the right action when the backlight driver is registered.  Using soc to 
split the chip driver into a core, backlight and video might be another 
option that lets you bring up the backlight driver before the video driver.
