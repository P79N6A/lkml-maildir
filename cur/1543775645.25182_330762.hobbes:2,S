Guys,
    We might have something here. If you are a driver writer, developer 
or want to help us, this is when.
PLEASE read the following article, it has the data of a guy that made a 
driver in IBM for Linux and he described the driver he made. He cannot 
release it, but he explained it and someone can write one. Believe me, 
that I would do it, if I would have any knowledge. ;-)

If you have an IBM Thinkpad with HDAPS, this is when you can help us 
with a driver.
Thanks,
.Alejandro
