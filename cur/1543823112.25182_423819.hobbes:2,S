I see. Good point. I ought to have actually looked at usb_submit_urb
and seen that it initializes status and actual_length. I'll make the
change.
To reduce my embarrassment, I'll point out that several other media
drivers also do this:
drivers/usb/media % egrep "urb->status.*=" *.c
<snip>
konicawc.c:        urb->status = 0;
se401.c:        urb->status=0;
stv680.c:       urb->status = 0;
usbvideo.c:     urb->status = 0;
w9968cf.c:      urb->status = 0;
In most of the above cases, it appears to be just before resubmitting the urb.
Thanks,
jaya
