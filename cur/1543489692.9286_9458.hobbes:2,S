Hello,
	Sorry to bother you with such trival question, but I'm here
	under a bit of pressure.
	I was wondering what card would you recomend which would
	fit following criterias:
		-10/100mbps suppport.
		-Supported under Linux (obviously :-)
		-*very stable* under all kinds of heavy load.
		-PCI based.
		-Currently being sold (preferably thru www.warehouse.com)
		-Works/Support in kernels 2.0.x.
Thanks a lot,
- - -Adam
