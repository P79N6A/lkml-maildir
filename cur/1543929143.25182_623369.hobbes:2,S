I think I saw some bridge code that calls it, too.
Regardless, it's EXPORT_SYMBOL(), but now unusable
due to the GPL-only symbol "init_net".
Meanwhile, you are avoiding answering the question:

Bull-pucky.  Somebody did:

That new BUG_ON() line complains if nd_net has not been initialized,
and the only thing I see drivers putting there is GPL-only "&init_net".

Avoiding the question again there, too.
I personally am not having problems with anything.
But I noticed the API change, and would like somebody to fix it.
Any of the three ways (or a fourth, if you've got one) might do.
