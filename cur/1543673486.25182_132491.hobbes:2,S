Any afs user space tool that needs to talk to file servers - such as all
the administration utilities - vos, bos, pts, etc. Eventually they could
use kerberos cred caches directly, but not until they are converted to
kerberos. Right now, they fetch the current auth data from the kernel
and use it to authenticate to whatever non-kernel service they are
talking to.
