Here's what suspend2's userspace user interface currently does
before suspending.
static void enforce_lifesavers() {
    struct rlimit r;
    r.rlim_cur = r.rlim_max = 0;
    setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &r);
    setrlimit(RLIMIT_NPROC, &r);
    setrlimit(RLIMIT_CORE, &r);
}   
All userspace user interfaces (text, fbsplash, usplash) share this
common code that is run before suspend itself proceeds.
Bernard.
