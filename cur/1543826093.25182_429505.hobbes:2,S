Subject: [PATCH 2.6.16.18] MSI: Proposed fix for MSI/MSI-X load failure
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
This patch suggests a fix for the MSI/MSI-X load failure.
Please review the patch.
Symptoms:
When a driver is loaded with MSI followed by MSI-X, the load fails indicating 
that the MSI vector is still active. And vice versa.
Suspected rootcause:
This happens inspite of driver calling free_irq() followed by 
pci_disable_msi/pci_disable_msix. This appears to be a kernel bug 
wherein the pci_disable_msi and pci_disable_msix calls do not 
clear/unpopulate the msi_desc data structure that was populated 
by pci_enable_msi/pci_enable_msix.
Proposed fix:
Free the MSI vector in pci_disable_msi and all allocated MSI-X vectors 
in pci_disable_msix.
Testing:
The fix has been tested on IA64 platforms with Neterion's Xframe driver.
