Subject: [PATCH 00/12] various lockdep patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The first 3 patches provide a new lockdep check, it verifies we don't hold any
locks when returning to userspace.
	lockdep-sys_exit.patch
	lockdep-i386-sys_exit.patch
	lockdep-x86_64-sys_exit.patch
Could the various arch maintainers that have support for lockdep help out
with placing this hook?
A journal_start annotation:
	jbd-lock.patch
Up until this point stuff should be safe to merge (assuming there are no
objections and bugs.. :-)
The rest of the series annotates lock_page():
  rework lock_page() API:
	trylock_page.patch
	lock_page.patch
	lockdep-page_lock-hooks.patch
  actuall lockdep annotation:
	lockdep-depth.patch
	lockdep-fs-page.patch
	lockdep-page-async.patch
	set_page_mapping.patch
	lockdep-lock_page.patch
Part of that is re-working the lock_page() API a bit. It introduces 
trylock_page(), and removes all the raw *PageLock() usage.
I've compile and boot tested this series on x86_64 (with and without lockdep).
And it completes an LTP run with lockdep enabled.
Andrew, can we start by pusing the lock_page() API rework into -mm?
 [ this series is against -linus, but if you're willing I'll do some 
   patches against -mm ]
