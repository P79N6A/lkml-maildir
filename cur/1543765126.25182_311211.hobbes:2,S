Jens, your patch works!  We are seeing a little bit increase in indirect
branch calls with your patch where our patch tries to remove elevator_merge_fn()
completely.  But the difference is all within noise range.
If there is no other issues (I don't see any), we would like to see this patch
merged upstream.  Thanks.
