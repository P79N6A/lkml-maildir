Well I just read Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt as advised by David
and it seems as though it will no longer be possible to do what
many programmers have been wanting to do, to wit:
(1) In user-code, allocate a buffer.
(2) Lock that buffer into memory.
(3) Call some driver that DMAs data to/from that buffer.
Although I have never done this, I have heard that this is what
screen-cards (X-Servers), and audio boards have been doing. Also,
I'm told my some M$xperts that this is what "Direct-X" does. I
don't know anything about the direct-to/from user DMA, as is obvious,
but if that's being closed-off, there may be a problem that's
just beginning.
For some reason, (claimed performance reasons) user-mode code
has to be able to get data directly from hardware with no
intervening copy operation. I think any claimed advantage goes
away when you look at the overhead necessary for user-mode
code to sleep before, and awaken after, the DMA operation but
often marketing departments make those decisions.
So, is it correct that you cannot DMA to/from a user buffer?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
