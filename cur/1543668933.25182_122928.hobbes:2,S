    Hi Greg :)
    Thanks for your help about this issue :)

    Which one, Configure.help? I've read the entry for usbmouse and I
didn't found any info :?

    Which advantages has this method. I mean, the mouse works with
gpm and usbmouse, and that is all I need. Maybe X problems?

    Didn't think about that, obviously ;))) The fact that I never
hotunplug a USB device doesn't mean it cannot be done ;)) Anyway,
this renders the autoclean feature unusable for that module ¿true?.
So, you must unload it by hand or, better, built into core.
    Thanks for your kindness, Greg, and for clarifying all that for
me. I owe you a beer if you come to Spain sometime.
