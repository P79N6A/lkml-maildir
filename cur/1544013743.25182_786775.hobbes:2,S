I've made this adjustment and commited this change as follows
below.
Thanks everyone.
sparc: Use 64BIT config entry
Use 64BIT config entry to distinguish between 32 and 64bit builds
instead of relying on the ARCH setting.  Using sparc64 as ARCH still
forces 64BIT on.
Inspired by the x86 and s390 configs.
