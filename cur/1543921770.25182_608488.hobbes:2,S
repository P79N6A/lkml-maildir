Of course, I should have written it much shorter by saying
flush_scheduled_work could be done internally just like you suggested!
My point is to make this all safer and simpler, so we don't have to
remember each time about these differences wrt. locking. Then checking
of such patches could be much easier. Unless this current behavior
of flush_scheduled_work has any real advantages, worth of this
potential unsafety. (Btw. is there any reason to use this with
rearming works, anyway?)
Thanks,
