I know, but a cut error with 15 lines apart is a bit odd. You shouldn't
use the "unreadable" font for xterms, that makes the "cut" action a lot
easier :)
But then again, like I explained before: even if you would have pasted
SG_MAX_SENSE in your message, it would still not make sense, cause that
is being used in the old and deprecated sg_header interface (which you
should not and apparently do not use in cdrecord).

Making up this kind of excuses doesn't really improve your credibility.
Just admit and fix the bug in cdrecord, and work with Jens to fix the
remaining bugs in the kernel. Everybody makes mistakes, even people
with over 20 years of experience.
