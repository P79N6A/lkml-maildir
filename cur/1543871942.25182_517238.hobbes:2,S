Thanks for the feedback Andrew. I've implemented all your recommendations
other than the kernel thread handling, which I still have to look into.

The reason is likely because it's only called by msp_gpio_init so it was

These exports are needed for other drivers compiled as modules can control
the GPIO pins through this driver.
