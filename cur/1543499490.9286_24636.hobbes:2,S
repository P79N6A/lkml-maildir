I find khttpd is a reasonable idea. I dont know what youre talking about
with "lower performance than a user space httpd",
http://www.fenrus.demon.nl/
 seems to indicate otherwise -- what
performance measurements were you looking at? B)
Remember that the current khttpd is basically proof of concept and 
actually approaches zeus performance wise -- and they werent even trying
very hard!
Now if you plug khttpd in front of apache the advantages become obvious.
Apache isnt exactly a speed demon -- but with khttpd it could be.
We want to kick M$' ass as much as possible in the performance arena.
khttpd is one way to do it.
