Hi,
I'd like to present Software Suspend v7. It's against 2.2.14.
It can be downloaded from
http://falcon.sch.bme.hu/~seasons/linux/swsusp.html
 and
ftp://ftp.externet.hu/pub/people/seasons
The egcs bug seems to be fixed. (Still I haven't tested it
myself).
However there are still some features to be added.
Kurt Garloff said:
"Yes. Devices handled by kernel space drivers should have kernel support
for hw state saving and recovery. At least those that most users use, i.e.
sound, serial, parallel ports, network interfaces (connections can't be
saved, I guess ...), SCSI. Also the SMP support would be nice to have. On
the other hand, currently the patch is already quite useful!"
There is a notify_chain so that device driver which want to do a device
specific action by suspend/resume they have the possibility to do
so. However myself don't know enought about e.g. scsi and smp so I think
someone who knows _much_ more about these topics than me could more easily
write state savers for these devices.
I think that this patch should slowly get into 2.3.x. The egcs bug has
been a drawback until now.
Feedback is welcome.
