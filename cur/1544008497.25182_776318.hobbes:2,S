When OS/2 hit write error, it wrote to another location on disk and added 
this to its sector remap table. It could remap both metadata and data this 
way. But today it is meaningless, because the same algorithm is 
implemented in disk firmware. Write errors are reported for disk 
connection problems, not media problems.
For connection problems, another solution may be to retry writes 
indefinitely until the admin aborts it or reconnects the disk. But I don't 
know how common these recoverable disk connection errors are.

If you are running a transaction processing software, then it is a very 
important worry. All the database software is written with the assumption 
that when the database returns transaction committed, then the changes are 
permanent.
Most of the business software can deal with the fact that the server 
crashes, but can't deal with the fact that database returnes committed 
status for transaction that wasn't really committed.
