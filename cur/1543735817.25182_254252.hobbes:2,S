I was rather thinking of some prominent printks at module init time.
People using distro kernels will never see compile time warnings.
I just added some warnings, but modprobe ipchains always fails on
2.6.9-rc2:
FATAL: Error inserting ipchains
(/lib/modules/2.6.9-rc2-rcf/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/ipchains.ko): Device
or resource busy
in log buffer:
ip_conntrack version 2.1 (8191 buckets, 65528 max) - 332 bytes per
conntrack
Unable to register netfilter socket option
Am I missing something?
