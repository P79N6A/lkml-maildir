Unfortunately, it becomes _really_ messy if we want to zero some part out
(normal for continuous-only filesystem). I'll look at it more, but I have 
a nasty feeling that we may lose more on extra code.

Oh, fsck... It's even more interesting for mutual deadlocks. And then
there is a wonderful situation with writing into mmaped area with offset 1
byte... Hrrrrrmmm... I wonder how well other kernels handle that. The most
obvious way would be to force page-in before grabbing the destination page
and to get_page() on (one or two) pages containing the source. Messy.
