Use the signal that will be sent to your userspace program when an
interrupt happens.
If you can handle the small latency that causes it should be fine, but
if you can't, then you should be using poll :)
It all depends on the hardware you are using, your processor, and what
your tolerances are on your interrupt handling latency.
