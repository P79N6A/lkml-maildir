Hello,
When creating a lot of Java threads per second linux slows down to a
crawl.  I don't think this happens on NT, probably because NT doesn't
create new threads as fast as Linux does.
Is there a way (setting ?) to solve this problem ?  Rate-limit the number
of threads created ?  The problem occurred on linux 2.2, IBM Java 1.1.8.
Thanks,
							Arnaud
