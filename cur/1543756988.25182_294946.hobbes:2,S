The reason I marked by response OT is that the time from power on to
userspace does not seem to be a big problem.  It's the amount of time
from user space to presenting a login prompt that's way too long.  My
distro (Debian) runs all the init scripts one at a time, and GDM is the
last thing that gets run.  There is just no reason for this.  We should
start X and initialize the display and get the login prompt up there
ASAP, and let the system acquire the DHCP lease and start sendmail and
apache and get the date from the NTP server *in the background while I
am logging in*.  It's not rocket science.
