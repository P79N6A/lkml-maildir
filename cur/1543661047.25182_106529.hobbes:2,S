I did test memory and found no problems.
I regressed to kernel-2.4.8 and gcc-2.96 and was able to successfully build
XFCE without a glitch.
I now plan to progress to kernel-2.4.19, which I have, and attempt build
with gcc-2.96.  If that works or fails I will progress to kernel-2.4.20.
After that I will bump gcc up and see what happens.  I suspect gcc really
works the system with recursive system calls and memory paging.
I tried ksymoops and it ran soooooo sloooooow.  I am not sure I have it
right and I was not able to get results.  I just need to study more I guess.
I don't do this for a living so I beg your forgiveness and appreciate the
input and patience from everybody.
