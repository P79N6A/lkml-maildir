To me it makes sense to append an ELF NOTE to vmcore which can uniquely
associate that vmcore with a particular vmlinux file (Some string
equivalent to the output of uname -a).
Interesting thing is that to find version of vmlinux, you will still be
doing <string | grep "some pattern">. Probably then we should append an
ELF note to vmlinux file also?
Thanks
