Try reading the timer_create man page.
In short, you're limited to a single clock, so you can't set timers
based on wall-clock time (subject to NTP correction), monotomic time
(not subject to NTP, will not ever go backwards or skip ticks), the
high-res versions of the previous two clocks, per-thread or per-process
CPU usage time, or any other clocks that may get introduced in the
future.
In addition, you've introduced an entirely new incompatible API that
probably doesn't fit easily into existing software that already uses
POSIX timers.

Yes, but the standard explicitly allows you to do this. Furthermore, if
you work within the existing framework, you can lobby for the inclusion
of your API in the next version of POSIX.
Simplicity of the code is only a virtue if you don't have to do the
exact same thing again with a different interface later while keeping
the maintenance burden of the existing proprietary (and, thus,
unpopular) interface.
