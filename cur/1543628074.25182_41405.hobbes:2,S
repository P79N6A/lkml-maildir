I don't know nothing more than this...
I already send an email, and I hope I'll get DMI & PCI informations
for these computers.

Thanks for your USB patch. I got the USB mouse to work
on Sony Vaio PCG-R505JL. I installed RedHat 7.2 first
and the mouse would work for a few minutes and die
(with timeout messages appearing on
/var/log/messages). I did not find the source code for
redhat on the CD. So I ended up compiling the latest
kernel (2.4.18). This is the first time I compiled the
linux kernel, couldn't have been easier!

I had the same USB problem on the Sony PCG-R505JS laptop. Your kernel
patch worked perfectly. At least on the 2.4.18 kernel.
