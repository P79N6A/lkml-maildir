I think I know what the problem is.
In include/linux/libata.h, make sure the preprocessor declarations are as 
follows.  I think the defaults have ATA_ENABLE_PATA undefined.
#define ATA_ENABLE_ATAPI        /* undefine to disable ATAPI support */
#define ATA_ENABLE_PATA          /* define to enable PATA support in some
                                 * low-level drivers */
Sorry I forgot to mention this earlier.
