pci=noapic doesn't change anything, but I remember having weird IRQ problems 
on identical boxes before (in particular, a normal 8139too network card 
doesn't work if ACPI 2.0 support is disabled in the BIOS), so this is a 
likely candidate for "severely broken BIOS needs workarounds and happened to 
work earlier by coincidence"
