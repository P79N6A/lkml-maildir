MK> Helo, one question. Why some raw sockets are opened without any processes?
MK> On 2.0.x I had opened 1 socket (type 1), on 2.2.x there are two (type 1
MK> and 6). In /proc/net/raw they have no inodes, any task structure haven't
MK> got them. So, what are they for and is there constant number of them?
These are the sockets used by kernel for tcp and udp.
