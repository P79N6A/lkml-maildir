IANAL, but GPL is a copyright license. Copyright is the right to make copies of 
somethings, to distribute it to be precise.
So if I write foo.c and release it under the GPL, and JR Hacker takes it and 
writes foo++.c but doesn't give his super duper sekrit version to anyone, then 
he isn't bound by copyright laws (he isn't making copies) and therefore the GPL 
doesn't hold for him.
The moment he wants to give a copy to his best friend, the GPL does kick in, 
though, and he has to abide by the GPL and distribute the whole piece (as it is 
a "derivative work") with the source code included (or an offer, or whatever. 
Read the GPL sometime, its not legalese at all).
For more information, ask your friendly (*cough*) neighborhood lawyer.
