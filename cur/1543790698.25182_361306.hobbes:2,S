Did you do a 'make oldconfig' first?  This is very important when
keeping config continuity from kernel build to kernel build.
That should have asked you some questions about how to set any new
options, and removed any old, now invalid ones while maintaining the
working options you had set in the .23 .config.  Thats all done
automaticly by my buildit script, which I edit to give it the old
version to reference, and what new version I'm building next.
