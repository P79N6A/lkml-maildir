Actually,
ed evaluate.c <<EOF
/evaluate_member_dereference
/examine_symbol_type/m/ctype =
w
q
EOF
ought to take care of sparse, AFAICS.  IOW, in evaluate_member_dereference()
we need to do examine_symbol_type(ctype) before checking ctype->type, etc.
As it is, we end up with SYM_TYPEOF node there and it's not expanded until
we'd checked if we have SYM_STRUCT.  We would, after expansion, but we don't
do it until too late.
I haven't checked if that's causes any regressions, but it looks
straightforward enough to be a plausible fix.  I won't test it until
tonight, though (see above).  Minimal testcase is
struct foo {int x;} v;
typeof(v) *p;
void bar(void)
{
        p->x = 0;
}
and any serious regression testing should get both the sparse tests and
comparing kernel builds with and without that fix...
