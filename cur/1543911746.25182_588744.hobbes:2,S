If one compiles the kernel C to boot from reserved memory area (subset
of memory area used by kernel B), then I can skip the step of kexecing
from C to D? (COFIG_PHYSICAL_START)
Alternatively, can we give hint to kernel C to run from a specified address
at run time with the help of command line parameters. What I mean boot-loader
can load the kernel at any address, but kernel will move itself to run
from a different location depending on command line parameter.  For example,
let say kernel_run_addr = 0x1000000. This parameter will tell the kernel
to move itself to 16MB address and run from there. I think it can be made
to work with little work in existing setup of relocatable kernel.
Kernel run address can be put by some user space script which will save
the hibernated image of original kernel. So after saving the /proc/vmcore,
script can modify the boot loader config file to append the right
command line to the kernel (kernel_run_addr).
After hibernation, user will shutdown/reboot. Next time the kernel boots
it will load at 16MB addr (because of kernel_run_addr) and then it can
restore the previously saved image.
We shall have to get rid of (kernel_run_addr) parameter from command
line while resuming. One can restore the image (krestore) and then edit
the boot loader config file to get rid of command line param, kernel_run_addr.
In this scheme, with the help of relocatable kernel, we can use a single
kernel for everything. (A, B, C, D). We will also avoid additional kexec
from kernel C to kernel D.
I think in the long run we shall have to work out so that a user does
not have to maintain multiple kernels. 
Does this make sense?
Thanks
