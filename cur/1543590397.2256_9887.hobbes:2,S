Hi,
Put up the final packet-0.0.2k patch, against 2.4.4 and 2.4.5-pre1.
A more complete changelog, since packet-0.0.2j:
        - Fix b_count bh bug, forgot to release buffers
        - Fix lock_buffer buf
        - Remove pkt_gather_data rerun to print buggy buffer list, that
          bug has been fixed.
        - Changed proc layout to /proc/driver/pktcdvd/pktcdvdX, one file
          per writer. Also compiles without proc fs support now.
        - Set quiet bit on write cache settings, drive may not support
          it
        - Remove PACKET_WAKEUP ioctl (buggy too, noticed by jgarzik)
        - Merge with 2.4.5-pre1
        - Added recovery mode
        - (with above) Added relocate_blocks super operation
        - Missing break in PACKET_GET_STATS ioctl
        - invalidate_device changes
        - Always piggy buffers to maintain b_end_io consistency
        - Change several BUG's to complain and abort nicely
        - Remove __dump_rq from ll_rw_blk and SCSI
        - Updated INSTALL and FAQ
        - Added kernel UDF diff
        - Fixup end_request handling
        - Put unplug back in
        - Rewrite kernel thread setup/exit
        - Set device RO on BLKROSET
*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/packet/
The sourceforge packages are going up as I write this, so should be
there very soon. Note that a UDF patch is now included against the
kernel UDF, so you don't have to use cvs udf for a stable setup.
Background -- this is a module that allows transparent writing to CD-RW
(CD-R will follow) discs, so you can use it as a big floppy basically.
