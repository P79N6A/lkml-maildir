This is an hardware limitation. AWE series don't support multiple PCM 
streams.
So mixing multiple PCM streams must be done in software. Use either esd, 
artsd, ...
You could imagine a driver based software mixing but :
- it would make drivers far more complex -> more bug-prone,
- it may pose performance/feasability problems when your apps need 
accurate timings (Video/audio sync for example).
