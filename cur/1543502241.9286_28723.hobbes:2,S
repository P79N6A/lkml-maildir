Subject: PATCH to support dotted base directory names
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is against 2.3.10, although I don't think anything here has changed
in quite some time.
I've been using a non-standard filename hierarchy for some few weeks now.
It's been less trouble than I expected. This is an easy win. I urge you to
take it. The fact that e.g. /bin/ is the same number of bytes as /.bi/
means that a simple ed script can convert a whole box to this system with
little bloodshed.
This is my first use of diff -u. I edited one line in the patch (a
comment) after the fact. The trailing } looks funny, but seems to be OK.
