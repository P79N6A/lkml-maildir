Yes, the blockdev initially comes up with a 1024 softblocksize.  When you
mount a filesystem on the device, the soft blocksize gets rewritten to
(typically) 4096.
Unfortunately it remains at 4096 after the fs is unmounted, which is rather
silly.
In 2.5 you should use BLKSSZGET (sector-size, not block-size) to work out the
supported alignment.
I'm not sure what a good and general solution is really.  You might have to
resort to probing the size at runtime, by trying increasing blocksizes until
it works.
