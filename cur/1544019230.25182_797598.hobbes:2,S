Something that might or might not be doable in practice, but at least
it's a suggestion that I haven't seen elsewhere:
Create an include/user/ directory that contains a "mirror" of the
include/ directory _structure_, so that random exported header
include/linux/foo.h now has two parts -- include/linux/foo.h and
include/user/linux/foo.h.
- include/user/linux/foo.h contains the definitions that are needed by
both kernel and userspace
- include/linux/foo.h contains the definitions that are needed only by
the kernel
- include/linux/foo.h can simply #include <user/linux/foo.h> and no
other change (to source files which _use_ this header) is necessary
- no dependency on a kernel header will exist in a "user" header --
that's how it is now, but this way is more explicit
- the whole include/user/ can be shipped verbatim to /usr/include (or
wherever it is needed)
- no #ifdef __KERNEL__ or #ifdef CONFIG_ stuff in the "user" headers;
no stripping or unifdefing is needed
- it's easier to see exactly what is being exported
Of course, obvious disadvantages are:
- less readable in the sense that what used to be in one file is now
spread across two
- the split itself would probably require a tremendous effort
- other things?
It's just an idea...
