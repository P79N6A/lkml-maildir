this is not always true....
memset can be used as an optimized cache-warmup, which can avoid the
write-allocate behavior of normal writes, which means that if you memset
a structure first and then fill it, it can be halve the memory bandwidth
and thus half as fast. This assumes an optimized memset which we
*currently* don't have I think... but well, we can fix that ;)
