Thanks, I wasn't aware of that one, but had created my own version.
A couple more gallons of fuel to the flame :)
From .../linux/scripts/Lindent:
 indent -kr -i8 -ts8 -sob -l80 -ss -bs -psl "$@"
-psl: seams to be inconsistent with much of the kernel code.
6 == half dozen IMHO.
-sob: Ackkk! I prefer to have two blank lines between functions. I think it
just
makes things easier for the eyes to parse. But in general, I'd say respect
the
authors judgement in use of blank lines.
