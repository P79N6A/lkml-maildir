 Well the packets also has to create hard softirq loads in practice this means route
 lookup or something else for normal traffic the RX_SOFIRQ is very well behaved
 and schedules itself to give other softirq's a chance to run also I'll guess you 
 have softirq's not only from the network. If you decrease your load a bit you come
 to more nomal operation?

 Well maybe we should start to verify that this problem. Alexey did a litte program 
 doing gettimeofday to run to see how long user mode could be starved. Also note we 
 add new source of softirq's. 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <asm/types.h>
main()
{
	struct timeval tv, prev_tv;
	__s64 diff;
	__u32 i;
	__s32 maxlat = 50;
	  gettimeofday(&prev_tv, NULL);
	  printf("time control loop starting\n");
	  for (i=0;;i++) {
	      gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
	      diff = (tv.tv_sec - prev_tv.tv_sec)*1000000 +
	             (tv.tv_usec - prev_tv.tv_usec);
	      if (diff > 1000000) 
		  printf("**%lld\n", diff);
	      prev_tv = tv;
	      if (diff > maxlat) {
		      maxlat = diff;
		      printf("new maxlat = %d\n", maxlat);
	      }
	      if(!(i % 1000000))
		      printf("timestamp diff = %lld, maxlat = %d\n", diff, maxlat);
	  }
}
Cheers.
