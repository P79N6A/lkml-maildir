So it seems we have broken CPU hotplug again.
Does disabling/enabling CPU1 using
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online work?
If it does, please boot with 'no_console_suspend' in the kernel command line,
run:
# echo core > /sys/power/pm_test
# echo 8 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
# echo mem > /sys/power/state
and see what happens (you need to have PM_DEBUG set in the kernel .config).
Please send dmesg output generated right after the above (if it works).
Thanks,
Rafael
