Doing it by MARK a tables and rules is an ugly method, and like anything 
with is spread over many places (the mangle table to MARK), then 'rules' 
and 'tables', spreading an action into many places increases the chances 
of getting parts out of sync and having the whole not work as intended. 
And the 'ip' man page defines everything in BNF, which was hot stuff 
when Algol-60 came out (1960) but which is only readable to people who 
use it frequently.
The ipt_ROUTE allows putting all parts of of the action, from defining 
the set of matching packets to specifying the desired result, the 
routing. And if that changes, it need only change in one place.
Making good administration difficult because it fits some pedantic metal 
model is NOT a good way to decide which features to offer in a kernel.
