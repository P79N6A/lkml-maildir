Let me give an example.  Hotplug will automatically load the ALSA
drivers for my sound card, and /dev/snd/* are created (by devfs or
udev, it doesn't matter for now).  Suppose that, some time, I run a
program that tries to use OSS for sound.  Now, the ALSA OSS emulation
is not loaded by hotplug, and I don't want it to.  It's nice to have
snd-pcm-oss automatically loaded when some legacy application tries to
use /dev/dsp.
