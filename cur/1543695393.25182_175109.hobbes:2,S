Bingo.  This is why reallocation at the time of a failed read is also
necessary.  Yes the data are lost, yes the failure needs to be both logged
(once) and displayed to the user (once), yes if an application reads it
again before writing then it will be garbage or zeroes, but get the LBA
sector number moved to a place that is less likely to be unreliable.
Meanwhile software must still make up for defective firmware.
