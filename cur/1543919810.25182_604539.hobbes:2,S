I'm working on finding somebody to do that.

Oops, sorry about that.
The i5k_amb driver referenced in the Makefile diff is the same one that
I posted to lm-sensors a few weeks ago, though there hasn't been much
discussion after it was pointed out that someone had already written a
driver to achieve the same purpose.  Unfortunately, nothing's happened
to either driver; any thoughts?  I'm thinking that we ought to get one
of them into shape for upstream, though I don't particularly care which
one it is...
