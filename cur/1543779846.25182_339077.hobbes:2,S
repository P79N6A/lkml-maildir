Hello, Dick!
Thanks for your help so far!

Okay, I have seen that, too. I've seen that some drivers do it the other
way around as I do, but I still try to follow my idea that the
application allocs the memory and the dma / the driver fills it up.
Or are there fundamental problems I get with my approach which I haven't seen yet?

My DMA machine (ppc32, mpc8540 cpu) can do the whole 32bit phys address
space so, that's not an issue here.

Yes, only virtual space is contigous. The DMA can do nice
sg_lists and chained sg_lists, so, this should not be a problem,
too.

Why?
Actually I am planning to alloc more than 1.5GByte at once,
lock that down, build a big sg_list for all that memory because
I need to _continously_ feed it with data from the DMA. I get
about 200MBytes/sec and I cannot stop in between!
Greets,
Clemens
