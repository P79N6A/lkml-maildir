No.
But you _know_ if user is running X or not -- notice that kernel does
not attempt to printk() when X is running, because that could lock up
the box.
If user is running X, you don't need the delay.
if (CON_IS_VISIBLE(vc) && vc->vc_mode == KD_TEXT) {
	delay(10sec)
}
or something like that should do the trick.
