+		HPET Legacy Replacement Route option (hpet_lrr)
+
+HPET is capable of replacing the IRQ0 (connected INT0 PIN) routing for
+timer interrupt. The capability register (at offset 0 of HPET
+base address) has a bit specifying if HPET chip is capbale of doing
+this. OS can read the bit either from HW or ACPI table. (HPET ACPI
+description table -> Event Timer block -> bit 15, page 30 of HPET
+spec).  Ideally (I think so!) BIOS should set the ACPI table than letting
+the OS read H/W, which gives the BIOS a way to configure either legacy
+or Legacy replacement modes.
+
+Typically the motherboard has BIOS configured / hardwired IRQ0 to INT0
+(pin of APIC) connection. Linux assumes IRQ0 connected to INT0 unless it is
+supplied using an override parameter in the MPTable. Some NVidia chipsets /
+BIOS initialization code had configured to override IRQ0 -> INT0 connection
+and later a parameter was introduce (acpi_skip_timer_override) to get IRQ0 ->
+INT0 connection right.
+
+But a number of bioses (both phoenix and AMI) are not working as
+expected. (I have an AMI BIOS which sets ACPI table bit 15 to 0 and then
+connect IRQ0 -> INT2 internally, Another bios I have sets the ACPI table bit
+15 to 0, but does not connect IRQ0 -> INT2. Both would result in a hang in
+calibrate_delay() since there would not be any timer interrupts So I have
+provided a command line parameter which overrides
+the BIOS ACPI entry. So, irrespctive of the BIOS' HPET ACPI Descriptor
+table settings, if the parameter hpet_lrr=[0,1] is specified, it takes
+precedence.
+
+* When to use this parameter?
+
+Some latest versions CK-804 (e.g),(Actually the code initializes the
+CK804 in the BIOS), would correctly set the HPET such that there would not
+be any interrupts on INT0. Linux does not handle this situation very well
+because in linux, if HW is LRR capable, it is enabled from the OS. Still the
+timer interrupt handler is setup for IRQ0. Under this situation, you can
+force the parameter hpet_lrr=1, so that IRQ2 is timer interrupts.
+
+[root@mophia ~]# cat /proc/interrupts | grep 2:

+
+For 15 mts (900 sec), around 95k interrupts on timer looks kinda fine.
+
+* Known Bugs:
+I have tested it only with Nvidia CK-804. There seem to be some kind of timing
+issue between enabling the HPET with LRR set and start of tinerrupts. As a
+result of which, calibrate_delay() hangs because there are no interrupts. If
+you run into such a case, pass lpj=<bogomips * 500> as a work around. i.e, if
+your bogomips is 5000, pass lpj=2500000
