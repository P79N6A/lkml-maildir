Acer Aspire 1406LC          ole's radeonfb patch
I have to turn off dri, and then it works with the radeonfb patch. I
use this method because I like the fancy framebuffersplash on booting
.. although I do not reboot often when S3 wors ;)
You can find the patch here:
http://dev.gentoo.org/~marineam/patch-radeonfb-2.6.11-rc2-mm2
or for older kernels:
http://dev.gentoo.org/~genstef/files/radeon-s3-resume-2.6.10.patch
The problems with this patch are:
- you need to press a key to come back from the "resume-console" after resume.
- DRI in X does not work (at least for me with intel-agp, others
reportet it works)
I just disabloed it by not loading intel-agp (hotplug-blacklist)
I have not only issues with video not coming back, but I also need to
append acpi=noirq to my command-line that I am able to finish resuming
and use my devices correctly afterwards.
Regards,
Stefan
