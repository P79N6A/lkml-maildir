You think I don't know this? AUCC in its wisdom expects its students
to use NT to do their computing work, and few of the systems stay up
for more than 90 minutes without locking up. AUCC's answer to this is
to limit students to not more than 60 minutes at a time...

I look at it a different way: Requiring the benchmark to run for a
decent period will, in my honest opinion, result in one of two things:
 1. Microsoft producing a version of NT that is stable enough to run
    for at least the designated period of time.
 2. Microsoft participating in the benchmark and losing - and being
    unable to hide the fact because of the amount of publicity the
    said benchmark session has already had.
 3. Microsoft refusing to participate since they know that they can't
    win in such a scenario.
I personally believe that Microsoft are incapable of doing the first,
and can't afford the second, and therefore that the last is a given,
but I can also see Microsoft using the fact that the phrase "a month"
is imprecice to make it appear that different time measures were being
used to bias the results against them and they withdrew because of it.
THIS is the reason that I ask for a PRECISE time measurement to be
used, rather than an imprecice one like "a month". I'm not worried in
the slightest which one, any of the following, along with any other
precice term, is acceptable, providing it's at least 28 days long:
	28 days		 4 weeks
	29 days
	30 days
	31 days
	35 days		 5 weeks
	91 days		13 weeks
Best wishes from Riley.
