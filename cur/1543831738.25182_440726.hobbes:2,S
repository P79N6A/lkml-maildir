that's how big those instructions are roughly, while with the function 
call we likely have those parameters in registers already, mitigating 
some of the function-call overhead. (these tests were done with REGPARM 
turned on)
some of the assignments are also indirect, necessiating further loads, 
such as:
    INIT_LIST_HEAD(&q->task_list);
i roughly expected a net uninlining win of roughly this magnitude.
