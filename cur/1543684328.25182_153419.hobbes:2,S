Historically, the word "undefined" has become synonymous with
"worst possible thing" under Unix. If some operation is "undefined"
the implementor is free to low-level format your hard disk.
This is not a good thing. For instance, the MS-DOS 'open' has
defaults that are not harmful. Not so with Unix. There are no
defaults! You must be explicit. You can even create a file you
can't delete if you don't set the permissions correctly when
opening O_CREAT. Note you can even create a file called "*" and
"*.*". So, under Unix you gotta be careful. Like somebody's
.sig said; "Unix gives you enough rope to shoot yourself!"
Cheers,
