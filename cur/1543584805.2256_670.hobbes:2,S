Don't mix symlinks with mounts/bindings. Too much PITA and yes, it had
been deliberately prohibited. You _really_ don't want to handle the
broken symlinks and all the realted fun - race-ridden at extreme and
useless.
In automount-like setups you can _replace_ symlinks with bindings.
No need to mix them.
