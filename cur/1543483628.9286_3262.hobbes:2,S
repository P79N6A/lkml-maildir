I have the following problem with ttyS0 on Linux 2.2.1(i686):
My Kernel seems to boot correctly. It shows correct IRQ, correct base
address and correct UART for both serial devices, but after booting, any
software (e.g. minicom) does not connect to the modem. With kernel
2.0.36 it does under the same configuration. As I said there is no error
message on booting and there is no error message on syslog. I tried both
compiling serial support as module and compiling it hard into the
kernel, nothing worked.
One strange thing I have seen, but I'm not sure, if this was vital:
/proc/tty/drivers says:
serial               /dev/cua        5   64-67 serial:callout
serial               /dev/ttyS       4   64-67 serial
pty_slave            /dev/pts      136   0-255 pty:slave
pty_master           /dev/ptm      128   0-255 pty:master
pty_slave            /dev/ttyp       3   0-255 pty:slave
pty_master           /dev/pty        2   0-255 pty:master
serial               /dev/cua        5   64-67 serial:callout
serial               /dev/ttyS       4   64-67 serial
/dev/tty0            /dev/tty0       4       0 system:vtmaster
/dev/ptmx            /dev/ptmx       5       2 system
/dev/console         /dev/console    5       1 system:console
/dev/tty             /dev/tty        5       0 system:/dev/tty
unknown              /dev/tty        4    1-63 console
As you can see /dev/cua and /dev/ttyS is twice in the list! Is this
normal?
Does somebody know this problem, or better: Does somebody know a
solution?
Or is it just a simple fault of mine, that I missed doing some
configuration changes when upgrading to 2.2.x kernel? (A kernel boot
parameter?)
