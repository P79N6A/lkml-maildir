Subject: [GIT PATCH] Driver core patches for 2.6.21-rc1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/23/282

Here are some driver core fixes for 2.6.21-rc1.
It fixes up some problems due to the pcmcia changes I did in the last
round of driver core changes, removes an unused function, and backs out
the kmod changes as there was a nasty loop for people who use networking
as a module.  There's some other bugfixes here, and some powermanagement
documentation updates and clarifications (from -mm).
All of these have been in the -mm tree.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
