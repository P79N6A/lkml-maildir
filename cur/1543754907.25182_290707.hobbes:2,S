Subject: [PATCH 1/1] pci: Add Citrine quirk
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/28/89

The IBM Citrine chipset has a feature that if PCI config register
0xA0 is read while DMAs are being performed to it, there is the possiblity
that the parity will be wrong on the PCI bus, causing a parity error and
a master abort. On this chipset, this register is simply a debug register
for the chip developers and the registers after it are not defined.
Patch sets cfg_size to 0xA0 to prevent this problem from being seen.
