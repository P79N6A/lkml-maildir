I think our discussion may be drifting a bit.  Perhaps revisiting
some crypto system fundamentals might be helpful. 
The loop device driver provides a transfer module API, nothing more. 
Placing encryption code (which includes hashes) into the loop device 
driver is not appropriate.  The crypto functionality should be wholly 
contained in the transfer modules.
IMHO, all that we should ask of the loop.c transfer API is:
	a) Type of transformation needed (encipher or decipher).
	b) Data bits to be transformed and length.
	c) Key bits and length.
	d) A *UNIQUE* IV seed associated *ONLY* (!!) with the
           data in step b) above.  
A design goal of all modern crypto systems is that the security
of the system rest soley in the key.  IV's must be unique, not
secret.
Unique IVseed means "never duplicated".  An increasing block | sector # 
is one means to meet the unique requirement.  Transfer modules are 
free to further mangle the IVseed via whatever method they feel is 
appropriate.
