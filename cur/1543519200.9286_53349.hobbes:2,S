Attached was no diff, but rather a WordPerfect 4.2 document.
At first I was angry for such a useless file attachment, but
after thinking about it for a minute, my anger subsided, and my
sympathy became the dominant feeling.
You poor guy.  Someone PLEASE donate this man a WordPerfect 8.0

more modern format - but still useless.  Then we'd have a reason
to flame you, without feeling sorry for you.
