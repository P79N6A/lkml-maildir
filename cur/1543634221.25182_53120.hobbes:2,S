this won't be part of the htree indexing, however the biggest reason to be
concerned about shrinking the directory is the horrible performance that
ext2/3 have when dealing with large directories and the htree stuff will
hopefully eliminate that performance problem so the only remaining reason
would be to free up a few K of disk space (which is a MUCH less critical
issue)
