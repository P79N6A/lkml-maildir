Looks like a bug to me.  powerpc does appear to try to support the freezer.

yup.  I'd expect the freeze_processes() call would fail if this thread is
running.

kernel threads don't take signals in the same manner as userspace.  A
kernel thread needs to explicitly poll, via
	if (signal_pending(current))
		do_something()
rtasd doesn't do that, and using signals in-kernel is considered lame.

It cannot.
