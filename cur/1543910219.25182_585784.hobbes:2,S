My comments about the advantages of using that infrastructure
for *early* binding captured the key points ... it's "failfast".
For IRQs you're probably on decently firm ground, since it's
extremely rare that people not handle request_irq() errors.
Remember, I just pointed out that the "late fail" strategy
is unusual.  That doesn't mean it's wrong ... just it'll be
a bit of surprise, some cognitive dissonance to developers
picking up a Blackfin project, potentially more error prone.
