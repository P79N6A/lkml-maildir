I see it as duplication because the person who writes the
kernel is the one who ends up writing the libc syscall
bits or explains to the libc person for that arch how
things work.  And once one libc implmenetation of this
exists, it can be used as a reference for other libc
variants.
Finally, once it's done, it's done, and that's it.
