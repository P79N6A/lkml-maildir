I have a simple solution for your problem.  Just call the police and have them
arrest whoever is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to use Linux and
this mailing list.  (That *is* the only reason you're here, right?)  Then you
can spend your time writing a wonderful OS of your own to take its place.  Let
us know when you're done, say in 20 years or so...
