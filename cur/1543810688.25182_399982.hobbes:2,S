But it can possibly sleep.
Hm, wait, the put_device stuff can possibly sleep, the "raw"
kobject_del() stuff looks safe.  Either way, they don't create new
memory, unless you do something really wierd in your release callback.
So you should be safe here.
But if you want to be absolutly safe, look at the thread on lkml about
changing the scsi code to do the final release in a non-interrupt
context.  That looks like it might be the same thing you want to do
here to guarantee that nothing bad happens.
thanks,
