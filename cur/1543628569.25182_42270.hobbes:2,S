No.  It's simply a matter of nobody having done the required analysis to
find a really good way to reconcile XFS's way of doing things with
mainline vfs.  This is time-consuming work that requires a good deal of
skill, and right now there are many projects in the same category.
My advice to anyone who wants to make it go faster?  Jump in and start
doing the analysis (start with xfs/pagebuf.c).  If you are a company who
wants it to go faster, try offering money.  Otherwise, it goes at its own
speed, and this work will likely come up to the top of the pile later in
the 2.5 cycle.
