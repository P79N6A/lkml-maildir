Ah, ok. /sort/ of makes sense..

though i'd err more on the side of "dont do that" :)

Had a box under memory pressure and had to add a swapfile to relieve
said pressure. Noticed afterwards that it had been created under
umask 0022 - not good, and the chmod to remove read rights for all 
blocked. Thankfully, it was my desktop, not a multiple user server :)
I dont know, I think I'd prefer ability to change attributes of the
swap file while its still swapped - there are many other, and far
more catastrophic, ways for root to kill the box, does it make sense
to guard against this one if it interferes with normal operations?
