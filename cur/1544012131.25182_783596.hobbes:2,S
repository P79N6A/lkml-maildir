Christoph,
Thank you-- enabled, rebooted, success.
Steps performed/location in menuconfig:
$ make menuconfig
$ File systems
$ Partition Types
$ Hit 'Y'
$ Enable this: [X] EFI GUID Partition support (NEW)
Better question as well, need to find out if KNOPPIX or distro-CDs support 
this option, if one to boot into recovery and this option was not 
enabled.. that would not be fun.
Justin.
