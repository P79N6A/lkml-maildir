Perfectly valid argument.  My question: is it not a security problem
to allow signals to reach a suid program?

It's obviously not equivalence.  FUSE filesystem gets a subset of
ptrace's capabilities (and rather a small one).

There's a huge difference between slowing down, and stopping a
process.  I wouldn't consider the first a true DoS.

Yes.  The extra problem with FUSE, is that they are not _able_ to be
careful.  They can't even check if a file is in fact on a FUSE mount
or not without the FUSE daemon's intervention (lookup on a file will
be passed to userspace).
