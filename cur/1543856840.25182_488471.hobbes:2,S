Its not implementing the TCP state machine at all. Its implementing the
MPA state machine (see the iWARP internet drafts).  These packets are
TCP payload.  MPA is used to negotiate RDMA mode on a TCP connection.
This entails an exchange of 2 messages on the TCP connection.  Once this
is exchanged and both side agree, the connection is bound to an RDMA QP
and the connection moved into RDMA mode.  From that point on, all IO is
done via the post_send() and post_recv().
