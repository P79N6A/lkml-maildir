Yes we do I/O async so while the I/O is in action we could be just back in
userspace, but both shrink_mmap() and swap_out() are not something of
really so light (at least with >128Mbyte of ram). When we are running in
shrink_mmap() the current->counter is decreased as usual.
It's trivial conceptually make shrink_mmap() _fast_, adding two
prev_freeable,next_freeable pointers in the mem_map struct and adding
pages back and forth to the list (at the same time I now update
nr_freeable_pages). Probably I'll do that soon.
I see instead not trivial to decrease the cost of swap_out()... 
I agree that the timeslice has nothing to do with swapout/shrink_mmap
issue. But the timeslice _must_ be decremented as now during the
shrink_mmap/swapout passes, because otherwise we would risk to stall the
not trashing process too much.
