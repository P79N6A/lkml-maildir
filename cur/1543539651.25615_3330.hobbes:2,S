Which should really be done anyway wherever possible. Possibly make an
exception for graphics - give the X server and co "direct" access to the
graphics card only.

It shouldn't allow these blocks of unvalidated data through at all, then -
that's too dangerous. If the kernel doesn't know what's going on, HTF is
it supposed to enforce any kind of security or other system policy??

That's exactly what I wanted all along: remove the "do something
arbitrary, and no I won't tell you [the kernel] what it is" function, and
replace it with "update HDD firmware", "change PIO mode", etc.

It's not filtering; IDE commands shouldn't originate in userland to begin
with. Userland apps should make a request to the kernel for a specific
kernel facility; the kernel then implements this by sending IDE commands
as needed.
