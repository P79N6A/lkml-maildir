That is because you are going about it the wrong way. You cannot
simply set CC=gcc272 to build the kernelwith gcc272, alas.
You need to edit the main makefile, and in the line where it says:
CC      =$(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
... you need to change gcc to gcc272.
If you simply set CC=gcc272 you're losing the -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
options, and the kernel won't build.
Mike.
