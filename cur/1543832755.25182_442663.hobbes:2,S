I agree that it shows the problem, and that voyager is different from the
rest of the x86 implementations. 
At least for things like the cpumask_t density of processor ids
is still an interesting property.  The basic issue is that apicids are
not in general dense on x86.  Not being able compile with support
for only two cpus because your cpus happen to be apicid 0 and apicid
6 by default is an issue.
To some extent this also shows the mess that the x86 subarch code is
because it is never clear if code is implemented in a subarchitecture
or not.
Fernando can you just put a trivial voyager specific definition of
safe_smp_processor_id in mach-voyager/voyager_smp.c.  It isn't a fast
path so the little extra overhead of making two separate functions
is not an issue and then the generic header doesn't have to have
subarch breakage.  Just a definition of safe_smp_processor_id().
