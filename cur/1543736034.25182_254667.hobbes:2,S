Yes, now it builds fine on my laptop.
However, after a couple of reboots, there appears to be some verbose
messages regarding PCI something, but the my main complaint is the USB
subsystem which is failing miserably now.
I guess these are the relevant log messages excerpt:

Probably this isn't strictly related to VP, but surely it was introduced
by mm1 and mm2. Can't tell for sure. And please don't count as hardware
failure as it suffices to go back to 2.6.9-rc1 to get USB back to normal
;)
Any thoughts?
