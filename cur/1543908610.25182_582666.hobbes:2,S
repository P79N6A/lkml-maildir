*If* we switch to a markup language instead of plaintext (or instead of
plaintext with style recommendations), then submitters should at least
be able to do basic syntax checks without having a toolchain installed.
E.g. provide a scripts/checkdocumentation.p[ly] similar in function to
scripts/checkpatch.pl.  (OK, that one requires a perl interpreter
installed, but that's a fair requirement.)
One note on asciidoc:  I experienced the same as Willy when I wanted to
build git with manpages on a distribution without prebuilt asciidoc.
And when I finally managed to build a minimum asciidoc setup, I was
bitten by a syntax change in the asciidoc language, requiring a small
change to git's documentation source to be compatible with both asciidoc
7.x and asciidoc 8.x IIRC.
