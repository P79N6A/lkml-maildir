Don't do that.  You are blindly converting all remove entries to use
__devexit_p but __devexit_p should only be used when the function
itself is declared as __devexit.
I went through the entire kernel looking for uses of __devexit and
manually checked each reference to those functions, changing only the
functions that used __devexit.  I might have missed one or two but I
guarantee that your list is wrong, picking three files at random, none
of them use __devexit.
