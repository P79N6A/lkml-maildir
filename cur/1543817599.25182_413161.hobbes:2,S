Subject: [PATCH] Fix dcache race during umount
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/2/101

I think we finally have consensus on this patch.  However please speak
up if we don't :-)
Patch is against 2.6.16-mm2

### Comments for Changeset
The race is that the shrink_dcache_memory shrinker could get called
while a filesystem is being unmounted, and could try to prune
a dentry belonging to that filesystem.
If it does, then it will call in to iput on the inode while the
dentry is no longer able to be found by the umounting process.  If
iput takes a while, generic_shutdown_super could get all the way
though shrink_dcache_parent and shrink_dcache_anon and
invalidate_inodes without ever waiting on this particular inode.
Eventually the superblock gets freed anyway and if the iput tried to
touch it (which some filesystems certainly do), it will lose.  The
promised "Self-destruct in 5 seconds" doesn't lead to a nice day.
The race is closed by holding s_umount while calling prune_one_dentry
on someone else's dentry.  As a down_read_trylock is used,
shrink_dcache_memory will no longer try to prune the dentry of a
filesystem that is being unmounted, and unmount will not be able to
start until any such active prune_one_dentry completes.
This requires that prune_dcache *knows* which filesystem (if any) it
is doing the prune on behalf of so that it can be careful of other
filesystems.  shrink_dcache_memory isn't called it on behalf of any
filesystem, and so is careful of everything.
shrink_dcache_anon is now passed a super_block rather than the s_anon
list out of the superblock, so it can get the s_anon list itself, and
can pass the superblock down to prune_dcache.
I believe this race was first found by Kirill Korotaev.
