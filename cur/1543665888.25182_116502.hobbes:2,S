Yes, this looks much more sane. If you _really_ want to be anal about 
typechecking (and also checking that nobody can possibly use a user 
pointer incorrectly), you make
	typedef struct {
		unsigned int val;
	} compat_uptr_t;
and then use
	static inline void *compat_ptr(compat_uptr_t uptr)
	{
		return (void *)uptr.val;
	}
which should still result in readable code.
