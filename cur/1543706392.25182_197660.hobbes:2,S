That's a pretty minor difference, from the kernel's point of view. It's
basically putting the same numbers in different fields.

devfs tried to do just that. sysfs does it better though. I don't see
what that has to do with my point.

sysfs and devfs are very different. I said they both accomplish one
common goal, sysfs for udev and devfs for devfsd.

No I didn't. udev is userspace, devfsd is userspace. devfs is kernel
space, sysfs is kernel space. They're the same.

But sysfs is still setting naming policy in the kernel. Because you
didn't write the kernelspace static names in question, they don't exist?

devfs merely exports information the kernel knows, by which devfsd can
create device nodes.

And sysfs exports files that are (from a kernel point of view) very
nearly a device node.

Didn't say the current devfs was a good implementation of the concept.
Said I liked a devfs-like concept.

Yes it does, it requires sysfs.

udev tries to do the job without a devfs. I said that already. I think
there should be a kernel exported filesystem with kernel-created device
nodes, and that udev's role should continue to do something similar to what it
does now (manage permissions and user-supplied names), only on that
kernel-exported filesystem.
