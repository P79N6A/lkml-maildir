That'd be paragraph 2 b)
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.
... These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
Since your program, which happens to consist of one open
source part and one proprietary part, is partly a derived
work from the kernel source (by using kernel header files
and the inline functions in it) your whole work must be
distributed under the GPL.

"open source bits" ... from "the work as a whole"  ?
