     I tried to build 2.3.16 on an SS-10 with 2.2.10 currently installed, I
figured what the hell, 2.2.10 isn't stable anyway so might as well play with
the new stuff.
     I downloaded the bzip'd tar file, did:
	bunzip < linux-2.3.16.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -
     .. in /usr/src
     Then I make a symlink:
	ln -s linux-2.3.16 linux
     Did:
	make mrproper
	make menuconfig
	... configured the kernel pretty much the way I have the existing
	    kernel configured.
	make vmlinux
	Which exploded with the following:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.3.16/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer  -D__SMP__ -m32 -pipe -mno-fpu -fcall-used-g5 -fcall-used-g7 -DUTS_MACHINE='"sparc"' -c -o init/version.o init/version.c
make -C  kernel

     Are there some other files I have to replace or update before building
a 2.3 kernel?
