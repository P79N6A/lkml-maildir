It turns out I've had this in my tree since July 6 (from Jindrich
Makovicka), sent to Len on July 9.  Maybe he's merged it somewhere already.
I have seven acpi patches here, some of which have been in -mm for a very
long time.  I'll resend them all.  Could someone please promptly ack them for
2.6.13 or merge them somewhere or nack the things?
Thanks.
