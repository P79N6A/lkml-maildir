Hello brethren,
You can imagine a frustrated human who encountered a good piece of work
made by possibly otherwise good and respectable brother who unfortunately
(by his naive lack of understanding of the root of evil, to wit,
Microsoft) produced it in some Microsoft HTML-HELP format .CHM (I never
heard of this before!).
So, is there no hope at all for me to view it under any decent operating
system? (I will send a rebuke and chastisement to the author, of course
and explain to him how to distinguish between good and evil, but for now
I want to enjoy his work which he freely shared (see, there is some good
in him!))
Many thanks for being patient with me,
Tigran.
