One thing I noticed.
I'm looking at include/signal.h from linux-0.01 and the definition of the
signal() function, the prototype in include/signal.h is
void (*signal(int _sig, void (*_func)(int)))(int);
I then take a look in my copy of UNIX Network Programming by W. Richard
Stevens from 1990, and notice that he on page 46 says this :
"...
A process specifies how it wants a signal handled by calling the signal
system call.
#include <signal.h>
int (*signal (int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int);
..."
The return type here is "int" while Linus originally made the return type
"void". If Linus had copied signal.h from UNIX the return type would have
been "int"...
