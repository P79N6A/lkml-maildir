Unfortunately this happens on the box which I don't have physical access to,
I will try to supply as much info as I can.
An AMD64 box mysteriously dies from time to time.
Basically, problems start with:
"12:58:24 kernel: ata1: command 0x25 timeout, stat 0xd0 host_stat 0x1"
and after several occurrences of those,
"13:03:59 kernel: Slab corruption: start=c1949460, len=344"
appears. Last syslog message has time 13:05:59. I couldn't ssh into the box
after this, but ping works and TCP sessions are established.
I guess any disk access on the box is D-stated forever.
Attached tarball contains gory details.
