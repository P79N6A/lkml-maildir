You still keep pushing this on, without having clarified why you can't
just use the genhd functions for this instead of adding some array of
block_devices. And while you fixed the bio->bi_rw check, you still don't
indicate error when you call bio_endio() for this case. So submitter of
that io thinks it completes successfully, while you just tossed it away.
