For some reason do_try_to_free_pages() doesn't end up ever being happy
with how much memory there is free (that's why kswapd will loop).  But
you actually have a reasonable amount of free memory, so all the memory
free'ers will actually refuse to do anything.  The problem seems to be
that either inactive_shortage() or free_shortage() will just continually
claim that you have a shortage of memory. 
However, you actually do have memory:

I bet this is it.
It probably decides that you have a shortage of HIGHMEM pages. Which is
understandable, since you don't have any ;)
Does the following trivial patch fix it for you?
(If it doesn't, please try just removing the "continue" at line 930 or
so in the middle of the kswapd loop.  But I think there's something else
that makes kswapd just think it _should_ loop, and the lack of
zone->size testing in the inactive_shortage() calculations looks like
it).
	Thanks,
