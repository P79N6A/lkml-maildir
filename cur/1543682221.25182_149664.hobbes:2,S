"File alteration monitor", from Debian. It uses portmapperand is recommended 
to improve kde performance.
$ apt-cache show fam
Package: fam
Priority: extra
Section: admin
Installed-Size: 232
Maintainer: Joerg Wendland <joergland@debian.org>

Description: File Alteration Monitor
 FAM monitors files and directories, notifying interested applications
 of changes.
 .
 This package provides a server that can monitor a given list of files
 and notify applications through a socket. If the kernel supports dnotify
 (kernels >= 2.4.x) FAM is notified directly by the kernel. Otherwise it has
 to poll the files' status. FAM can also provide a RPC service for monitoring
 remote files (such as on a mounted NFS filesystem).
Nevertheless I saw the same message the morning after updatedb run.
