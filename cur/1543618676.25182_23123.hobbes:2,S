I'm trying to mount an OS-X Unix filesystem on Linux.  I haven't had
any luck at this, and wondered whether this is a known problem, or if
I'm doing something wrong.
I formatted a zip disk on a Mac OS-X, selecting the "Unix" filesystem
type and no partitions.  I then inserted this disk in the /dev/hdd,
the zip drive on my PC.  I tried mounting hdd and hdd1 through hdd4
using types of auto, ufs, udf, sysv, and one or two others, all to no
avail.
