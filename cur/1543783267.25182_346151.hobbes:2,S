not really fragmentation problems (the unit of allocation of argument 
pages is already a single page, and we do an array of pages), the real 
problem is the DoS - right now the array pages are unswappable while an 
exec() is ongoing.

i dont think we need COW. During execve() we are destroying the old 
context and are creating a completely new context, so in theory we could 
just 'flip over' the argument/environment pages (which are a parameter 
to sys_execve()) from the old mm into the newly created mm, without 
caring about the old mm.

yes, that's one of the issues. I've done some instrumentation some time 
ago and it seemed that the arguments are typically page-aligned, so the 
only issue would be to clear the partial page at the end of the 
arguments. But i still think the concept is volatile.

yeah. It's also pretty laborous though.
