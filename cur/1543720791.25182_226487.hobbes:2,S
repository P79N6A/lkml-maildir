hi
thanks for answering!
rc2 worked completely stable with c1 disconnect halt enabled and low
cpu temp.
rc3 has no C1 enabled after booting, so the cpu temp rises, but its
stable.
when enabling the c1 disconnect halt after this with something like
"setpci -v -H1 -s 0:0.0 6F=$(printf %x $((0x$(setpci -H1 -s 0:0.0 6F) |
0x10)))" 
(from
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Athlon-Powersaving-HOWTO/approaches.html#commandline
)
the cpu is getting cool again but the system locks up frequently.
so it would be great to have the fixup re-enabled at boottime.
maybe a switch to force the fixup on boards without c1 disconnect
bios-settings would do it ?
thanks,
lars
