Hello Richard B. Johnson,
I've just find out where the problem lying in your answer, that you are
not talking the same thing as i am. You are talking about the descriptor 
on which you are quite correct, while I am talking about GDTR, similar 
to selector, but not selector, could be called `selector' in GDTR. Two 
different things.
To All Hackers,
plz take my patch to make our kernel more perfect. Linux should be not 
only practical, but an ideal. And i have more such patches to send.
Regards,
Coywolf
