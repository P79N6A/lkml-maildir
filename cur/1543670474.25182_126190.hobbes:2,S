parport, afs, intermezzo, sunrpc, md, sound and um have their own
strdup variants.  ecard.c (ARM), xtalk.c (ia64), ide.c, blkmtd.c
(mtd), dlci.c (wan), parport (again), md (again), moctotek.c (usb),
scsiglue.c (usb), super.c (affs), inode.c (nfs), and generic.c (proc)
all open code it.
Most of them use it multuple times.
I think unifying the seven implementations, and over fifty uses, is a
minor but worthwhile goal.  It's not as widely used as it would be in
userspace, but still...
Rusty.
