I just did a traceroute to one of the IP addresses that fails with a TTL of
64 ... it is in India but the traceroute ends with a different IP address in
less than 16 hops ... proxy arp ???
Anyway ... with the  address in question is able to access my server farm
with a TTL of 128 but not with 64.  I have NO IDEA what those people are
doing inside their net ... and really do not care. The bottom line as far as
I am concerned is that if they can reach me, I should be able to reach them
... and with a TTL of 128, it appears that I can.
