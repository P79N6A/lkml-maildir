Oooooopppsss...Slight typo there, /dev/fs should've been /devfs

Those make sense...

Those might come one day - presumably when Linux is used to

Alternatively, they can mount /devfs as /devfs and put a symlink
in with /dev -> /devfs unless I'm mistaken?

Alternatively, they could just make /dev a symlink to /devfs if
I'm not mistaken?

I can agree with that without problem as it's what I would choose
to do anyway.

If there's going to be any cleanup of /proc it needs to be a
sensible one, and that isn't it.
Given the ability to design from scratch without throwing the
idea of backwards compatibility out of the window, here's what
I would do:
 1. Rename the current procfs as knlfs since that's what it
    really is: A means to get at kernel internal data.
 2. Have the knlfs root directory contain the following
    entries only - the paths shown assume that knlfs has
    been mounted as /knl on the system in question:
	/knl/dev	Directory for devfs to be mounted on.
	/knl/proc	Directory holding the virtual process
			directories that currently clutter up
			/proc and with the same internal use
			as they currently have.
	/knl/sys	The current /proc/sys directory.
	/knl/misc	Directory holding the files that have
			no real home at the moment, such as
			/proc/cpuinfo and the like.
 3. Define a new procfs filesystem that consists only of symlinks
    to the equivalent location in knlfs that can be mounted on
    /proc for backwards compatibility with existing entries, and
    make it clear from the start that no further entries to it
    will be accepted under any circumstances as it is strictly
    for backwards compatibility.
 4. Have procfs check whether knlfs has already been mounted when
    an attempt is made to mount it, and refuse to mount if not.
The only problem I can see with this approach is that existing
Linux setups make no allowance for it, and that would need to be
dealt with as part of any implementation proposal.

If something like the above was done, that shouldn't be a big
problem - that's what the redefined procfs is for.

It's not the only one - /proc/cpuinfo is in the same position.

That's why I can see something along the lines of the above
suggestion being the only way to satisfy both schools of
thought.
