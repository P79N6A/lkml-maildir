While I can't see any problems with the rest of the patch, I think this
part is wrong for the same reasons removing the kref_put() from the
class device cleanup function is. I don't see any constraint that
guarantees that dma_chan_cleanup() will always be called before
dma_dev_release(), which means that "chan" may have been freed before
this function gets a chance to run. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
