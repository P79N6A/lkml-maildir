Note that the problem is exacerbated if you have a bunch of disjoint 
stack scopes.  For that case, gcc will take the _sum_ of the stacks and 
not the union.  rth was kind enough to file gcc PR 9997 on this problem.
It is turning out to be fairly common problem in the various drivers' 
ioctl handlers.  Kernel hackers (myself included) often create automatic 
variables for each case in a C switch statement.  (and now I'm having to 
go back and fix that :))
