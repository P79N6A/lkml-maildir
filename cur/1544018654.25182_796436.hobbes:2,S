I don't see any particular problem with changing PSE or even Present 
with these functions; they don't operate on live in-memory ptes, so its 
not like they could ever be used to modify a pte unless followed with 
some kind of set_pte operation.  It is unwise to change any pte flag 
without knowing what you're doing (though P or PSE would probably have 
less subtle effects than some of the others).
But it probably wouldn't hurt to have a __ prefix to indicate they're 
"internal" and not for general use.
