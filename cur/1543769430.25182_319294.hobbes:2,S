Yes, that's right. Setting HZ would just limit the max frequency
with dyn-tick patch when system is busy. On OMAP, we're using HZ=128
with dyn-tick.

The dyn-tick patch skips ticks only during idle, and the system is
not doing anything at that point, so it should be safe. When the
system is under load, there is normal HZ tick and timer is not being
reprogrammed.

Yeah.
