	The new kernels require a totally new smbmount program.  The
old smbmount program came with the separate smbfs package, which is
no longer maintained.  The smbfs module is now part of the kernel
and the smbmount program is part of the Samba package.
	Get the latest Samba package (currently Samba 2.0.3) from samba.org.
	Unpack Samba and run configure with the "--with-smbmount" option.
	Build and install samba, and you will then have the new smbmount
program.
	Note:  The syntax to smbmount has changed.  Check the man pages
carefully!
