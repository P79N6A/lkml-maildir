Here's an example of a mixture of two approaches which leads to 
misleading code.
If you want to have abstract spi_master, then you have to disallow (or 
at least discourage) explicit usage of spi_master fields, otherwise 
'kzalloc is your friend' and you don't have toadd this spi_alloc_master 
API as it's basically useless IMHO.
As opposed to this, we use abstract handles where possible (i. e. for 
spi_message).
I'd have understood your dissatisfaction with that if you were 
consistently following the approach 'expose everything, forget the 
extensibility, viva lightwieghtness', but you're mixing things.
