No!
->count is how much bytes are already in buffer.
len is len.
->size is end of page(s).

I'd call function seq_memcpy() though.

Again, no.
At first buffer is PAGE_SIZE. If output is bigger, ->count is dubbed to
->size, so when ->show() returns, size of buffer is doubled until it
fits in. See "while(1)" loop in seq_read().
