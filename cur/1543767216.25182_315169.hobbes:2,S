Yes the way atomic types are provided may need a revision.
First of all we need atomic types that are size bound
	atomic8_t
	atomic16_t
	atomic32_t
and (if available)
	atomic64_t
and then some aliases
	atomic_t -> atomic type for int
	atomic_long_t -> atomic type for long
If these types are available then this patch could be cleaned up to
just use atomic_long_t.
