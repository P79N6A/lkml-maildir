Historically, this was a Linus call :)
IIRC it was one of (a) deprecated, (b) removed, or (c) almost removed in 
the past, and Linus un-deprecated it.  The logic back then was that it 
provides a quick summary of a lot of useful info, a la /proc/cpuinfo and 
/proc/meminfo.  i.e. you don't need lspci installed, just been /bin/cat.
Personally, I think it would be nice to eliminate /proc/pci -- in favor 
of something that provides similar functionality from sysfs:  "cat 
/sys/all-busses" or somesuch.  I dunno how feasible that is.  The main 
idea is to list as many attached devices as possible in one go, without 
having to cat 40 different files :)  [unfortunately I think this means I 
am disagreeing with you ;)]
I do grant you it would make various __init sections and in-memory 
structures smaller if we eliminated the names...   do we want to?  Sure 
we have lseisa and lspci and lsusb, et. al.  Does that obviate the need 
for a simple summary of attached hardware?
