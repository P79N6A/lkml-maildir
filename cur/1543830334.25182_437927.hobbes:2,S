Other than symbol exporting issues, you may encounter another problem
that we have encountered in systemtap (which is also a kprobes
client).  That is that the context where the kprobe was placed may be
such that calling most ordinary kernel routines is unsafe.  In
particular, ip_options_get_from_user may sleep, which may or may not
be legal from the context of the kprobe.  (In systemtap probes, we
don't permit anything to block/sleep/schedule, so instead suffer
absent-page errors.)
