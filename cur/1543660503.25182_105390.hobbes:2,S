I suspect the thread *does* have a larger cache footprint,
since in nonblocking I/O, session state is stored more compactly.
Also, the threaded approach involves lots more context switches.

No.  It provides an event record containing a user-defined state pointer
plus the IO readiness status change (different from IO completion status).
But that's what you need; you can do the call yourself.

Depends on how close to maximal performance you need, and whether
you might later need to scale to more clients.
The average server is so lightly loaded, it really doesn't matter which approach you use.
