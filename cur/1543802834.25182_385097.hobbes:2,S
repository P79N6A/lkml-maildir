Thanks and looks like the results are in from 2.6.14-rc2-mm1 with the patch 
backed out.
Drumroll....

The performance goes back to a range similar to 2.6.14-rc1-mm1 (see 
2.6.14-rc2-mm1 + 20328 in blue). Unfortunately this does implicate this 
patch. Can we put it back into -mm only and allow Peter's tweaks/fixes to go 
on top and have it tested some more before going upstream?
Peter, Ingo?
Cheers,
Con
