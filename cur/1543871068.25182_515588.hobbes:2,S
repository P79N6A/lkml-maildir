Subject: [patch] paravirt: clarify VMI description
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
clarify the description of the CONFIG_VMI option: describe the reality 
that VMI is a VMWare-only interface for now. Once that changes and 
another hypervisor adopts the VMI ABI we can change the text. As it can 
be seen from the Xen paravirtualization patches submitted to lkml the 
Xen project has chosen its own, non-VMI interface between Xen and the 
para-Linux - so remove Xen from the description.
