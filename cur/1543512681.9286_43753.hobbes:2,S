unfortunately... I just listen some mp3 songs played
through es1938 from alsa 0.4.1b on 2.3.20. I decided 
to start some real work, so I typed
  umount /asd
where /asd was dead ncpfs filesystem (server died...).
Unfortunately, music start repeating last second (64KB?)
and after few seconds I got:

console shuts up...
  I searched my module binaries and I found only one sequence of bytes
in 'code'. It was in snd-es1938.o:
  testb  $0x1,0xbc(%ebx)
  jne [line_above]
  jmp <snd_solo_trigger+20>
  So just to let you know, I'll bother alsa developers after I find some way
how to send bugreport through email and not through WWW interface.
But I do not understand how EIP matches with stack trace. Or is it
EIP from CPU1 and stack trace from CPU0? (*)
  I do not know, what was CPU0 doing when this happenned. Is it possible
to get other CPU state through IPI or detect that another CPU NMI-oopsed,
so do NMI-oops too (at worst at next tick...).
                                    Best regards,
                                    		Petr Vandrovec

(*) I asked these question already about month ago, but no-one replied.
But my oopses EIP do not match stack since I have SMP board.
