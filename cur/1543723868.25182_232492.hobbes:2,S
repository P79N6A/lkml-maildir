No, that's right. The device is gotten for the length of time that 
it is in the cache, and is put when it is removed from the cache.
In this way, the device is not free()'ed as long as the cache holds 
a reference to it.
I can add a comment, but it seemed 'obvious' from the description of the
cache that it would be holding a reference to the device for an indefinite 
period of time.
The patch was really to fix the result of a misunderstanding of what 
the poorly-named routine "pci_get_device()" does:  yes, it does a get(), 
but it also does a put(), which one wouldn't guess from the name :(
A better name for this might be "pci_next_device()" or 
"pci_obtain_device()" or something like that ...

Oops.
