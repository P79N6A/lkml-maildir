For the record as of 2.3.7pre2-dangerous this seems to be broken on
multiple archs:
alpha:   #define spin_trylock(lock)      ((void) 0)
arm:     #define spin_trylock(lock)      do { } while(0)
m68k:    #define spin_trylock(lock)      do { } while(0)
ppc:     #define spin_trylock(lock)      do { } while(0)
sparc:   #define spin_trylock(lock)      do { } while(0)
sparc64: #define spin_trylock(lock)      do { } while(0)
i386 and mips seem to get it right (i.e. "(1)")
