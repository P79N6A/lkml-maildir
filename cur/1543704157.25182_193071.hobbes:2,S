I notice in the 2.4 configuration utilities there are places where I
have "utf-8"
for a default code page, but there are other places that use "UTF8".  It may
seem an idiotic question, but does the dash ("-") create significance?  
Should
all references be UTF8 or utf-8?
I notice under the SuSE 9.0 locale files, the dash seems significant and 
it won't
find the right locale files if you put utf8 in some places.
Thanks,
