This is more or less what klive currently does, except it's a bit more
sophisticated than that, so you don't risk to lose uptime if a udp
packet is lost (or if the server goes down, or if dns resolution fails),
and secondly currently klive gets right suspend to disk. But it still
gets right suspend to disk, when system is suspended that's not
accounted as "uptime".
