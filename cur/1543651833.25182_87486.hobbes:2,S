So then the NMI checks for timer interrupts being serviced
in this case?  But, still, why the turn off if the timer
does not go thru the APIC?  The case this came up in is an
SMP machine, but the test in apic.c shows that the PIT
interrupt does not go thru the APIC.  Leaving NMI on seems
to work, so I am wondering if this is just old code.
