cdrecord 2.01a28 wants:
when doing dev=/dev/dvd -atip:
OR
dev=/dev/cdrom blank=fast
0x46 0x55 0x1e 0x1 0x35
when trying to write:
0x46 0x55
dvd+rw-mediainfo wants:
0x46
k3b wants:
0x46 0x55 0xac
Those are all command I've seen so far:
0x1 REWIND
0x1e PREVENT ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL
0x35 SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE
0x46 ?
0x55 MODE SELECT(10)
0xac ERASE(12)
Here is the patch I've been using:
