From the way you've been arguing, this wasn't clear.

So far, I've not seen any core developers coming out in favour of
this. Even Ingo stated much of the low-latency code/ideas weren't a
good idea.

So what will convince you? Is it up to Larry to extract statements
from the top 10 developers that it's a bad idea? Or, is it up to you
to extract statements (at least one) that it's a good idea?

Linus has shown he's receptive to patches that make sense in a broader
context and are clearly correct/worthwhile, even if a bit "tasteless".
I wouldn't worry about the mainstream kernel getting slower due to an
"easy" option of using RTLinux. It seems to me the kernel keeps
getting faster in many areas. Kernel hackers are speed freaks. It's a
matter of pride to keep the kernel fast (yet still elegant).
Remember that keeping reasonable control over latencies is good for
the general case as well. So these issues won't be ignored.

The issue is not whether IRIX is preemtive or not. The issue is the
cost of that preemption.

You or someone else. Doesn't matter who. I simply don't believe that
once we have 99% "perfection", some people won't start clamouring for
the last 1%. I can imagine some mis-guided vendor cracking under the
pressure and forking the kernel, because "it's now so easy to get that
last 1%" (even though it won't be).

Well, from what I've noticed of Larry's debating style, he probably
figures since you're the one wanting to make a change, it's up to you
to demonstrate why it's justified and measure what the costs are.
The position of do nothing requires no justification. Yes, that can be
frustrating, but that seems to be how things work around here. I've
seen it from both sides :-/
