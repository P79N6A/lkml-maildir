It is on it's way out, since:
1. Most hardware sec sizes are obscelny lower that the minimal logical
sizes those days (512 ver. 4096 page size),
so the tuning there doesn't matter.
2. All of it is "tuning", which can be handled generically on higher
levels. (Like setting FS blocksize....)
3. The hard limits are handled on device driver level anyway (best
example here are the odd fs block sizes for iso9660 filesystem).
