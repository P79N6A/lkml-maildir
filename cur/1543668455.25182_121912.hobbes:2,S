Hi,
On my Pentium IV 2Ghz and Intel i845 motherboard, adjusting the CPU
Frequency with:
echo powersave > /sys/devices/sys/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
makes the system clock start skewing into the future at a very fast
rate: the clock time advances at approximately ten times its normal
speed (one minute of system clock flies by in less than 5 seconds of
real time). Adjusting scaling_governor back to "performance" fixes the
problem.
Is this a bug? Am I doing something wrong?
Thanks!
