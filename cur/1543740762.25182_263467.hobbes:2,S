First, you can always execute sync() and flush most of the file-buffers
to disk. This frees up a lot.
In the kernel....
If you are doing a lot of kmalloc() allocation and free(), you
can write out the pointer values using printk(). I use '0' before
such ... printk("0 %p\n", ptr); do `dmesg | sort >xxx.xxx`. Now
you can look at the file and see the sorted pointer values. If
they repeat, chances are pretty good that you are not leaking
memory.
In user space...
Periodically look at the break address.
If it keeps going up, you may have a leak. If it's stable
you probably are okay.
The only sure way of detecting a memory leak is to use
some substitute code (maybe a macro) that substitutes
for (intercepts) the allocator and deallocator. It eventually
executes the allocator and deallocator after saving information
somewhere you define (array, file, etc). You can sort that
information and determine if there are as many (k)mallocs() as
there are for (z)frees()  (for instance) of the same pointer values.
