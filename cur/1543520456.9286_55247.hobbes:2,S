Just had a lockup on a 2.3.33 x86 (mobile Celeron-A); no reaction 
Putting the computer into suspend-to-disk and back (this is a notebook
with an actual suspend switch - keyboard combinations including SysRq
didn't do anything) actually fixed the problem - looks like some bug in
interrupt handling?
