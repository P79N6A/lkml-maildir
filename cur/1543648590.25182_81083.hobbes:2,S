   With the patch I just sent, that size issue should be resolved.
   
I really apprecite that you've done this work Greg.
Thank you.

   I would love to implement it in such a manner.  Without using
   self-modifying code, do you have any ideas of how this could be done?
   
Yes, I agree it's a difficult problem.
My main point is, don't compare the security bloat to USB, because in
the USB case if I don't use it I get no space/time consumption even if
I have it enabled (as a module).  This is not true for the security
bits.
