In drivers/input/misc/pcspkr.c, pcspkr_event() in the SND_BELL case,
you could add a reroute so that SND_BELL events are passed to
userspace (think /dev/input/pcspkr). Delays are of course possible,
and it really depends on how the scheduler does its job (read: you
might want to renice your userspace part).
