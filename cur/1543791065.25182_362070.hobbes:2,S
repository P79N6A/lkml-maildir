Not in the pthread spec (at least not for normal SCHED_OTHER tasks), and 
Linux/glibc don't really provide any either. In particular, if one 
thread unlocks a mutex and immediately tries to relock, there is no 
guarantee that any other thread waiting on the mutex will be able to get 
in and lock it before the first thread can relock.
