Should be fine then. Migration does
	- take object mutex
	- unmap_mapping_range() -> remove all PTEs for all mappings to
          that object
	- do whatever is needed for actual migration (copy data etc...)
	- release object mutex
And nopage() does
	- take object mutex
	- check object flags consistency, possibly update VMA
          (also possibly updaet VMA pgprot too while at it for cacheable
           vs. non cacheable, though it's not strictly necessary if we
           use the helper)
	- if object is in ram
		- get struct page
		- drop mutex
		- return struct page
	- else
		- get pfn
		- use helper to install PTE
		- drop mutex
		- return NOPAGE_REFAULT
We don't strictly have to return struct page when the object is in ram
but I feel like it's better for accounting.
Now there is still the question of where that RAM comes from, how it
gets accounted, and wether there is any way we can make it swappable
(which complicates things but would be nice as objects can be fairly big
and we may end up using a significant amount of physical memory with the
graphic objects).

I can be done with returning NOPAGE_REFAULT but as you said, I don't
think it's necessary.
Cheers,
