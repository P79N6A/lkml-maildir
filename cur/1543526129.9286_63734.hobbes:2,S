I've hit the same problem once. I've "fixed" it by using the path compiled
in. An other option was an env variable. Don't like either of those two.
btw: Someone will probably tell that argv[0] is not always the executable
but could be a sym-link, which I my case was good enough, because it was
supposed to be in the same dir as the executable.
I think this behavior is new since 2.2, but not sure tho.
