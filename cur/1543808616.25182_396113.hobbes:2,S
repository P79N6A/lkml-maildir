I once had a PCI probe function OOPS with the nvidia module loaded. Previous 
run was alright, and rebooting with exact same setup worked the next time and 
never failed again for the time I was using the nvidia module on that 
computer.
I can't be positive that it was the nvidia module, but the probability of it 
having to do with it is quite high. It at least triggered something.
