David,
I've subsequently found out that the via KT133 sucks, and there's not much
that can be done.
I replaced it with a (somewhat newer Via) P4X333 chipset motherboard
(difference CPU of course) and the driver works perfectly fine.
I've heard that the KT133 and a lot of via's older chipsets cannot handle
multiple busmasters on PCI transactions properly.  I suspect disabling DMA
on the harddrive may fix the problem, but I have not looked into this
possibility as I got the new machine.
Hope this enlightens...
