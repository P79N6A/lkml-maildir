My patch fixes sysfs_create_bin_file which returns error and not the dentry,
the assignment to dentry is a dead assignment. But anyway I indeed missed
the second place where the dput is problematic. What I don't like about
the new patch is that dentry is accessed AFTER the dput. The chances are
slim but the dentry could have been deleted and if the dput drops the
reference count to zero you access an already freed structure.
blue skies,
