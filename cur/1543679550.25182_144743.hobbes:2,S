And if a separate serio is not possible, then at least a separate input
device. It definitely should not be mixed together into one input device
when in reality there are two.

... why? I really don't see a reason why we should generate any
synthetic events in the kernel. Not at the device driver level, not at
the handler level.

There exists an XFree86 driver that uses eventX for Synaptics. Same
thing hopefully will be added to GPM soon. AND, I hope I'll be able to
get rid of the relativization code in mousedev soon, too, because it's
beyond ugly, as soon as a similar XFree86 driver is written for 'generic
tablet's.
