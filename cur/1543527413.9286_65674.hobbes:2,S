I just want to mention an invalid URL in the file Configure.help
> Superior solutions to the problem of booting and configuring
> machines over a net connection are given by the protocol BOOTP and
> its successor DHCP. See the DHCP FAQ
> 
http://web.syr.edu/~jmwobus/comfaqs/dhcp.faq.html
 for details (to

> that has a program like lynx or netscape).
the url given (
http://web.syr.edu/~jmwobus/comfaqs/dhcp.faq.html
) is no
longer valid. I do not know the new url of the faq.
