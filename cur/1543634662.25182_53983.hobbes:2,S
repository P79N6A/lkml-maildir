Subject: build failure for 2.5.24-dj1

Hi,
upgraded in the usual way:
- store .config
- make mrproper
- put .config back
- make oldconfig
- make dep
- make KBUILD_VERBOSE= KBUILD_MODULES=1 bzImage
but this time the build failed due to undefined references to `key_maps', 
`keymap_count', `func_table', `funcbufsize', `funcbufleft', `funcbufptr', 
`accent_table_size', `accent_table' and `plain_map'
this is related to this warning during the build:
set -e ; loadkeys --mktable defkeymap.map | sed -e 's/^static *//' > 
defkeymap.c
/bin/sh: loadkeys: command not found
as all of these functions should be in defkeymap.c
upon inspection I found that with 'make mrproper' drivers/char/defkeymap.c 
is removed which it did not do in earlier kernels.
on my system 'loadkeys' is not installed because i did not have the kdb 
package installed (I did not need it). looking in Documentation/Changes of 
2.5.24-dj1 I could not find any reference to kdb so I think it should be 
added in the list of neccesary software since it is now!

proposal (add it to the list of minimal requirements):
diff -u linux-2.5.24-dj1/Documentation/Changes.orig
