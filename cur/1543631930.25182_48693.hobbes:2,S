Well, Martin's patch is already in 2.5.18.
Also, I really don't like version numbers - that only shows that the
author _designed_ for crap. I would suggest either:
 - no version number, and just confidence that you won't need any more
   statistics.
 - no version number, and a file layout that is inherently expandable (or
   rather: multiple files with clear names, one value per file).
There just is never any excuse to add version numbers, that just later on
acts as an excuse for being sloppy.
