Nice idea, I really like it. Some ideas: perhaps it would make sense to
store the .config information in a more compact manner (at the kernel
side), tables (won't give much compression, but would destroy the
"binary identical" feature) or some LZW compression (isn't the code
already there, in the networking layer ?) ... the latter would save
about 80 % (resulting in 2KB kernel bloat instead of 10), but would
save every bit of the original file. Of course, you could store the
file's size in addition to the compressed contents...
Just my 0.01 Euro ...
