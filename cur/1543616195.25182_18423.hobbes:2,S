Hi,
I install and used 2.4.17 for about a week before my filesystem 
corrupted.  I've tried 'fsck -a' but it complains that there was no 
valid superblock found.
Are there any tools or techniques that will recover data from the 
corrupted filesystem even if there isn't a valid superblock?  Or is 
there a way to write a temporary superblock so I can access the 
information on the disk?
Lastly, if all else fails I'm going to try sending the drive one of 
those 'file recovery companies'.  Does anyone have a recommendation for 
a particular company?  I'm guessing that there'll be a few that wouldn't 
know what to do with a ext3 partition.
thanks,
-Kervin
