Lately I had problems with baycom_ser_fdx, which uses do_gettimeofday
for the decoding. These problems could be explained by do_gettimeofday
tv_usec
field anomalies.
The next day however I tried to prove this and worte a test program,
but the time looked quite normal at that time.

If that happens infrequently, it's not a problem for baycom_ser_fdx
(the worst that can happen is it looses a packet), but otherwise
I need a different high resolution clock (resolution less than 100us).
What should I use for this?
