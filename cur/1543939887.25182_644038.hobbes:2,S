Ough, does this mean that for a multi-user scenario of 2 non-root users "A" and
"B" each running exactly 1 process with nice level 0 and 19 rerspectively
that both share ~50% of the CPU *and furthermore* that that user "B" does never
ever have a  chance to be nice to user "A" although his process should really
use only those CPU cycles not eated by any other user ?
If the answer is yes what's about extending the current behaviour to consider
(optionally) nice level of running processes in the case where
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED is set ?
But anyway the initial email reports not a regression related to the ondemand
governor.
