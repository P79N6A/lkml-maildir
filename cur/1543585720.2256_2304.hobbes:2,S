My patch already fixes OOM problems caused by overgrown caches/buffers, by
making sure OOM is not triggered until these buffers have been cannibalised
down to freepages.high.  If balancing problems still exist, then they
should be retuned with my patch (or something very like it) in hand, to
separate one problem from the other.  AFAIK, balancing should now be a
performance issue rather than a stability issue.
