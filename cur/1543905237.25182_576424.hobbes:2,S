For me, it is generally the case yes. We are still discussing this in the 
context of desktop machines and their problems with being slow as things 
have been swapped out and generally I expect a desktop to have plenty of 
swap which it's not regularly going to fillup significantly since then the 
machine's unworkably slow as a desktop anyway.

Once we're crammed, it gets to be a different situation yes. As far as I'm 
concerned that's for another thread though. I'm spending too much time on 
LKML as it is...
