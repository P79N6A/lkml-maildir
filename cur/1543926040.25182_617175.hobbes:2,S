I see what it does, but don't see the "why" ... surely
you can come up with a one sentence description of why
this would be better?
And I'd been so glad to *get rid of* that list, too.

But it still protects data.  Don't remove documentation for
what locks protect ... update it!  Otherwise someonels going
to come by and make a change which breaks the locking model.
Usually in some subtle (hard-to-debug) way.

Note that this now produces the debug info in a relatively
random order ... ordered by registration rather than anything
useful, and hence awkward to read.
It'd be better if you just scanned your new gpio_desc[]
table in numeric order, and start a new section whenever
you find a new gpio_chip.
That'd get rid of that otherwise-useless list, too.
