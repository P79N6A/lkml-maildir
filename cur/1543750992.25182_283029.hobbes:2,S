Exactly.

Have any particular features in mind? If you have some, you can fork off
your own BK repository and play there (wait... that is how (currently)
out-of-tree drivers are developed!). Or you could start an unofficial
experimental fork. If none of the above, I guess you'd just have to wait
until Our Fearless Leader decides it is time for 2.7.
Just forcing a 2.7 "because that'll stabilize 2.6" is nonsense. Because
then 2.6 won't stabilize any faster (probably slower).
