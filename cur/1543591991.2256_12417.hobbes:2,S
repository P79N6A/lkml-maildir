Ignoring your obvious attitude problem for now (you haven't ever
considered the fact that (almost) all the people on this list develop
Linux voluntarily, in their spare-time?!), I suggest you try
at #kernelnewbies on irc if you want response. Or you could try to
download a newer version of the kernel. You know, the bug might've been
fixed since v2.4.2...
