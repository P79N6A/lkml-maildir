Sounds great.  Hopefully it slows down a bit from being a moving target.

I didn't look at these that much, but I'll make two generic observations:
 1) current tunneling (including sanity checks which are, I believe, a bit
non-existant at the moment) should be generalized to handle v6-in-v6 and
v6-in-v4 tunneling anyway.  Not sure if this is the right way, but that's
IMO one priority item.
 2) without IPSEC, there is no way to secure MN-HA traffic.  Therefore I 
think the first priority is being able to support Correspondent Node 
behaviour.
I belive Alexey, Davem et al are best to justify whether this feels like a 
right approach.
Having IPSEC + MIPv6 in 2.6 series would be Really Cool, though :-)
