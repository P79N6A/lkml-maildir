Just to confirm:
a) the reason I didn't notice siimage native driver is because I was using 
2.4.20 and it's not there.
b) with 2.4.22 it works! And I get 54M/s on one drive and 38M/s on 
another, which is a lot faster than my onboard IDE controller.
Now, let's hope that ide-scsi subsystem (and thus my DVD writer) still 
work with 2.4.22. I heard some problems about ide-scsi on 2.4.22...
Kind regards
Tigran
