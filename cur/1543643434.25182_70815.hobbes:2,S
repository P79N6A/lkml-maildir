Alan,
Thanks for your reply - I appreciate all the hard work you guys are doing.
My experience to-date with the kernel is to compile it - not to try and fix
something. However, I could try and fix it,
although I feel it would be better for the kernel maintainers to fix it, as
I am inexperienced with Linux kernel level
programming; I come from an application programming arena.
Pat, I am cc'ing you on this so you know what is going on - this is the
root-disk problem that I emailed you about.
Alan

Yes its in my bug list. Its up to someone it matters to to provide
patches. It could be a ramdisk change. it could well come from the
initrd loading cleanup/root ramfs stuff.
