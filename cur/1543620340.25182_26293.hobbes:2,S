  The freezing machines all have RAID-1 and fast CPUs and a lot
  (500-1000 MB) memory ?  .. and are SMP ?

  I reported on this two months ago, and a month ago I figured out
  that non-SMP kernel works just fine (although the other CPU
  at my SMP machine now idles...)
  Since then I have had to move the machine into location where
  I can't poke at it daily, and thus I can't test the thing now.
