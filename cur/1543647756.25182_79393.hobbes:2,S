No.  No core code uses it, and that's for a reason.  I suggest
you simply use 1/0 instead.

Tons of duplication.  IIRC there was a political reason not to have
common versions, but IMO the duplication is far to big nowdays to
not have a generic library version.

Linux style for this would be:
extern int trace_set_config(int, int, int, void *, void *);
But, yes, that looses some info.  When doing multi-line
prototypes please at least use tabs and add the actual
parameter names (like e.g. XFS does):
extern int trace_set_config(
	int		do_depth,	/* Use depth to fetch eip */
	int		do_bounds,	/* Use bounds to fetch eip */
	int		depth,		/* Detph to fetch eip */
	void		*lower,		/* Lower bound eip address */
	void		*upper);	/* Upper bound eip address */

Umm, why don't you just use trace_even in the actual code?

What about an enum?

Instead of adding per-arch stuff here I'd suggest using asm/trace.h
with an asm-generic/trace.h for the default version.
