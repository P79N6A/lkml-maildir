OK, after looking at the bug report things smell very strange:
	* kernel had barfed on lookup for /dev/console.
	* kernel had found /dev - right inode number, etc.
	* read_cache_page(inode->i_mapping, n, ext2_readpage) on it
gave all-zeroes for each page within first 32Kb (size of /dev on box in
question).
	* filesystem is not corrupted.
	* all that stuff had happened with cold caches.
	* kernel was 2.4.6-pre3 + some unspecified modifications.
Very odd. Could somebody try vanilla 2.4.6-pre1 on a PPC box? I _really_
doubt that it might be an architecture-specific problem in directory
code - it would simply fail the lookup for  /dev in that case.
I'll try to find a PPC nearby, but it may be tricky on weekend. So if
somebody wants to help... Notice that problem was on read-only mount,
so it can be tested without risking fs corruption - just try to boot
with init=/bin/sh and do ls -lR, etc.
