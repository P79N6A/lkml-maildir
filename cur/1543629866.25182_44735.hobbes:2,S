Greetings.
I have a Toshiba Satellite 1605CDS (laptop).  It has a Phoenix BIOS, and
  an ALi 1541 chipset (aparently with M5229).  Relevant 2.5.14 boot info:
May  8 04:31:10 paulus agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 122M
May  8 04:31:10 paulus agpgart: Detected Ali M1541 chipset
May  8 04:31:10 paulus agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xe0000000
May  8 04:31:10 paulus ATA/ATAPI driver v7.0.0
May  8 04:31:10 paulus ATA: system bus speed 33MHz
May  8 04:31:10 paulus ATA: interface: Acer Laboratories Inc. [ALi] M5229 IDE, on PCI slot 00:0f.0
May  8 04:31:10 paulus PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:0f.0.
May  8 04:31:10 paulus ATA: chipset rev.: 32
May  8 04:31:10 paulus ATA: non-legacy mode: IRQ probe delayed
May  8 04:31:10 paulus ide0: BM-DMA at 0xfcf0-0xfcf7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
May  8 04:31:10 paulus ide1: BM-DMA at 0xfcf8-0xfcff, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
Anyhow, ever since I've seen the ALi 15xx chipset option (in the kernel
  IDE chipset-specific config section), that is, since possibly before
  kernel version 2.4.0, whenever I've enabled the ALi chipset support and
  then suspend the laptop, the BIOS halts partway through the suspend-to-disk
  screen (the "Sytem Information" and "Conventional Memory" sections complete
  the save-to-disk operation, but the "Extended Memory" bar never gets past
  zero progress; this is all in the "Phoenix NoteBIOS 4.0 Save To Disk Manager"
  screen, which starts a few screen flickers after calling apm -s.  BIOS is
  set to suspend to disk instead of suspending to RAM).
Any ideas what might be causing these problems?  Thanks!
