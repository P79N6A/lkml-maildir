It's not entirely clear to me whether the kernel is doing any retries or 
not. It likely should be, but somebody more familiar with the block 
layer would likely have to answer whether it will be or not..
Certainly if we are already retrying and the drive keeps saying "no seek 
complete" there's not much the kernel can do about it..
