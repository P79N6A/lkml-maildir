If another CPU holds the kernel lock, we spin until it has released it,
just as any other spinlock (<asm-i386/smplock.h>).  lock_kernel prevents
any other processor from simultaneously executing any other code that
is also protected by the big kernel lock.
spinning means constantly polling a lock until it's available.
