Re: list
The list for this driver is acpi4asus-user@lists.sourceforge.net
I'm not on that list, but presumably the maintainer,
Corentin Chary, is.
When I see patches for the platform specific drivers on
linux-acpi, I generally do try to pick them up, but I usually
request an ACK from the primary maintainer --
for often I have no means by inspection or testing
to verify the change, and that maintainer is the one
who gets the headache if the patch causes problems.
I'd pick them up if I see them on lkml as well - but I only
see lkml messages if they are addressed to me or if they
have the word "ACPI" in them.
Finally, I'd definitely pick them up if the primary
maintainer forwards them to me.
I've been offline since before the holidays,
just getting back online now.  Apparently I didn't find the
holidays as boring as Linus did.
