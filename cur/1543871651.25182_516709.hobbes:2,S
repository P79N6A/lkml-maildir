    Regarding the delay: I've discovered a weird thing. When the display
is garbled, if I insist on outputting more text to the screen, sooner or
later it de-garbles! In fact, once the display has been garbled (not
easy to do, sometimes I can work for hours in a terminal before it gets
garbled, I can't reproduce it always), a continous output makes it
de-garble and garble again, in cycles.
    Looks like an off-by-one error rather than a speed/sync error, am I
completely clueless?
    This happens with vanilla 2.6.19.5, not with the patched one, which
I haven't been able to test yet (sorry...).
