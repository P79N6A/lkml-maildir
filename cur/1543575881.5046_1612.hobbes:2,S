Umm, you're right; the manufacturer describes the chip as "10Mbps Embedded
Ethernet Controller" which just happens to be able to be used on an ISA
bus.
Therefore, it is NOT an ISA peripheral, but a general purpose peripheral.
As such, it should NOT be classified as an ISA bus device, and therefore
should NOT depend on CONFIG_ISA.
(I hope there are enough NOTs there).
