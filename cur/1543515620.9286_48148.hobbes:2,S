I would be very careful here. libsvga doesn't like fbcon very much. If you
have libsvga programs I would recommend libGGI. They have a svgalib
wrapper and with libGGI you can run your svgalib programs in X windows or
on fbcon. This is how I do this.

Try fbset without using accels. I get the same problem with XF86_SVGA and
matroxfb. For low end PC graphics hardware hitting the accel engine and
the framebuffer at the same time can lock the machine.

Because vesafb doesn't use accels at all.
