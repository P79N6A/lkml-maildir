When cross compiling a PowerPC kernel on an i386 machine, got the following 
error:
binfmt_elf.c: In function 'create_elf_tables':
binfmt_elf.c:166: 'CLOCKS_PER_SEC' undeclared (first use in this function)
binfmt_elf.c:166: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
binfmt_elf.c:166: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [binfmt_elf.o] Error 1
for folder /usr/src/cross/powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu/src/linux/fs
Copied the binfmt_elf.c code from the test9 tree and recompiled.  Compile 
then proceeded without errors.  If whoever is in charge of this section 
would like a copy of the .config file, I would be more than willing to 
attach it.  On a side note the kernel was being compiled for a POWER3 
processor, but it doesn't appear as though that would be a factor here.
