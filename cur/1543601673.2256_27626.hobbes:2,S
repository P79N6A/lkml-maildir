You continue to put the state check ( ioctl() ) before the system call,
that require you to use select()/poll()//dev/poll interfaces that are
state inquiry interfaces.
The /dev/epoll is, like i said before, a state change notification interface.
That's how have been designed and that how it completely avoid fds scan.
If you're looking for a state inquiry interface it's better for you to seek /dev/poll.
