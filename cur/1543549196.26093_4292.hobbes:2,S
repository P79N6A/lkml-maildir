It has LSF, the Linux Socket Filter.

Yes, the LSF.

BPF opcodes works on LSF. LSF has some extensions to BSF, like
fetching which interface the packet came from.

LSF does not work with devices nodes, it works with setsockopt:
	struct bpf_program bpfp;
	/* Fill bpfp */
	setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &bpfp, sizeof(bpfp));

Last time I checked libpcap was emulating BPF in user space. Which is
bad of course because all packets are copied...
Ideally, libpcap should be extended to support the LPFisms. A LSF
filtering some ethernet traffic does not have to be bound to an
interface. You can filter all the packets coming in.
I can send you an example if you need so.
Phil.
