   I don't know, though... scratching my head here -- Is GCC actually
   able to distinguish between 'const int *a' and 'int const *a'?
   
No I don't mean this in a "C" sense, I mean conceptually that marking
an object const which has members which are volatile and updated
asynchronously makes zero sense.
