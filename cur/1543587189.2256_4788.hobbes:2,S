Thanks.  I'm building a database of these.  There is definitely an issue
with Via and interrupt routing.  Hopefully I can collate this data soon
and figure out what's going on.  I need to find some Via hardware for
myself, too, since I only have an old Via-based laptop which works 100%
;-)

I wonder though... In my mind this is a driver not hardware issue.  If
the XFree86 and/or Linux console driver do not use the IRQ, you need not
have BIOS assign one.  If you are feeling dangerous, try turning the VGA
IRQ assignment off in BIOS and see if things melt/explode/kick ass.
