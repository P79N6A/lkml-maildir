Oops, I meant that the patch fixes the align allocation (non zero
align_mask case). X86_64 doesn't use the align allocation.

With the old code, 'index' is tested by find_next_zero_bit.
With the new code and non zero align_mask case, 'index' is not tested
by find_next_zero_bit. So test_bit needs to start with 'index'.
So If I understand the correctly, this patch should not make a
difference for x86_64 though I might miss something.

Thanks for testing,
