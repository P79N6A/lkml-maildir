Personally I find it _extremely_ annoying having to go and lookup web sites 
which the kernel points me to instead of just having the docs in the kernel 
in the first place.
For source code to additional utilities, ok, fair enough, we can't have 
everything in the tree but for documentation, which is a pre-requisite or 
at least a help to understanding something about the kernel, I don't see 
why people have to just be referred out of the tree.
Especially because I only need to look up some URL just when I have no 
internet access for a week or two (and hence have the time to look things 
up)... Having documentation on some random web site is not going to help 
there at all. And guess what? I learned how to use bitkeeper when I was on 
holiday for two weeks. And guess also what? It was Jeff's document which 
was my main guide on how to do it in combination with the bk kernel tree. I 
would have been well pissed off if I had found that I needed to get the 
document off the web after I had gone away...
As a complete different, general point, the probability of documentation 
being updated when it is outside the tree is _much_ lower than when it is 
inside the tree. Admittedly the bitkeeper document itself is unlikely to 
change over time but the scripts helping submissions which are in the same 
place as the document may very well change over time.
I would much rather see a disclaimer put in Jeff's document stating that 
"you don't need to use it, gnu patches are just fine with everyone, etc" as 
others have already suggested.
If such disclaimer doesn't appease the anti-bitkeeper crew then moving the 
document out won't either, so moving it out would be a waste of time in 
addition to penalizing people who want to use bitkeeper, which is unfair 
and incorrect.
Finally, if you object to this _that_ much, why not fork the tree remove 
the document, and live happy ever after? Perhaps all the anti-bk people 
will follow you... (-;
Best regards,
Anton
