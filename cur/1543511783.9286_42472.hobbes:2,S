The difference is that you'd still read the document if the section was
renamed, while others wouldn't.
I read it, all the while thinking "maybe the author isn't a total
fuckwit, I should read it, maybe the author isn't a total ..."
The doc is ok but I didn't learn much. I confess I probably would have
appreciated what was new in the document more if I hadn't simultaneously
been trying to decide if the author was an idiot.
