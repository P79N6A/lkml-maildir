Hello!
I tried 2.6.24-rc1-git11 with "allmodconfig ARCH=um" today.
this gave at least two errors - i needed to set CONFIG_SMP=n and CONFIG_UML_NET_VDE=n to make it compile.
not sure if options should be set to "n" automatically or being fixed differently, but if there is something broken or some header file missing,  from an "end-user`s" point of view errors like this may be hard to get around.
it`s nothing against UML, it`s just the fact that i would expect "allmodconfig" or "allyesconfig" to work out of the box.
one should be able to compile a kernel without the need to use google, imho.
many automated cross-compile tests i have seen till now mostly show more broken than successful builds, as you can see at 
http://l4x.org/k
 , and issues like this don`t help making this better.
minor issue, though......
regards
roland

This is an option which requires support on the host (in the form of
vde being installed - pcap is another example of this).
