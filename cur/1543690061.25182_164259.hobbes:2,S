Right, so, don't break tg3 :)  The patch I posted doesn't do the 
_and_set, which tg3 needs.  netif_poll_{enable,disable} control whether 
the net stack may call the dev->poll() function.  tg3 asynchronously 
disables polling, resets the phy and/or hardware, then enables polling 
again.
I thought I had a check in there for when it was contending with 
dev_close(), but I'll look again.  The hardware/phy reset should 
continue to occur regardless of dev_close() -- that's ok.  During this 
event, all rx/tx is already stopped anyway.  So we can let ifdown/ifup 
events occur in parallel... carefully.  :)
Ideally we want to present a machine that's asynchronously managing its 
power state and various functions.  dev->open() and dev->close() events 
become just two more "major events."
