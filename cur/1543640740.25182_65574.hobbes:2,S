The problem is we need a special DMA engine for this broken puppy.
I am trying to remember the rule for forming the dma-table, and it is not
nice.  The 4 byte issues is a direct result of building the SG which is
not compatable to the hardware.
508 + 4 is okay but 510 + 2 is not.
Now I have to remember why :-/
IIRC, we have to have 4 byte boundaries on the list.
This is where I need some extra help and doing something like the trm290
but for all of OSB4 because parsing out the broken engine bases on asic
revisions is darn near impossible.
Big Problem -- Big Hammer.
Tough if it tanks some of the performance, but it is better than the
deadlocks we are getting now.
Yeah I expect to take heat for this one from ServerWorks and it may cost
me later, but nobody else has got the guts to press the issue for the
correct solution.
Then again if we solve this correctly I have "ends justify means"
argument.
Cheers,
