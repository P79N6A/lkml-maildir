The evolution theory assumes that features are not planned and are developed
"as needed", but you know you'll need the feature at some point and you can
design for it without actually implementing it.
Now in swsusp we do something like this:
freeze()
atomic_snapshot()
save_image() (=> snapshot_read() in a loop)
power_down()
If I understand it correctly, you'd like to do something like this:
freeze()
save_LRU() (=> snapshot_read() in a loop)
atomic_snapshot()
save_image() (=> snapshot_read() in a loop)
power_down()
Suppose there are no LRU pages to save (unrealistic, but helpful).
In such a case save_LRU() does nothing and your procedure is identical
to ours.  Thus you can assume, for now, that you always have 0 LRU pages
to save, put placeholders wherever needed and go on.  Later on you'll be
able to replace the placeholders with something actually useful.
Further, we can assume that snapshot_read() can only be called before
atomic_snapshot() for saving LRU pages and no changes to the interface
will be needed.
Greetings,
Rafael
