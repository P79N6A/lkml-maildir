It is my understanding that signals cannot be guaranteed to work
according to the POSIX threads specification without the CLONE_PID option.
Please don't say this can be done reliably in userspace; it takes a severe
performance hit for signal handling and adds several levels of complexity
to any pthreads library that uses clone. The way I understand it (and it
has been a while since I read anything on the subject) is that certain
fatal signals are supposed to be received by all threads/affect all
threads no matter which thread receives it. I believe this includes at
least one signal that cannot be handled. So how do you propogate this
signal reliably to all other threads in the process?
Of course, I may have no idea what I'm talking about, too.
