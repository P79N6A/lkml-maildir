I'm using portmap_5beta.tar.gz from slackware 3.4 source.
You can get it from all slakware mirrors
(for example at 
ftp://ftp.jussieu.fr/pub/linux/distributions/slackware/source/n/tcpip1
 get portmap_5beta.tar.gz and portmap_5beta-col.patch)
It compiles out of the box with glibc 2.1.3 (except that there are tons
of warnings...)
