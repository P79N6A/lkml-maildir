This came up on the FreeS/WAN list and seemed to me worth raising on
the kernel list...

[snip discussion of various bits of FreeS/WAN breaking on RH 7 ...]
I actually think that the way RHL7 does this is quite appropriate.
The kernel is tied to an obsolete gcc -- not Red Hat's fault.  I think
that this is a big mistake.  The kernel should not be tied to GCC, let
alone a particular narrow band of releases of GCC.
So it is appropriate that Red Hat has broken the linkage between the
standard C compiler and the one used for kernel compilation.
Furthermore, cross-compilation should be a normal option.  For the
kernel and for our project.  So this requires the ability to specify
*two* compilers for a kernel build -- one for compiling tools used in
the build process, and one for compiling code to be included in the
kernel.
