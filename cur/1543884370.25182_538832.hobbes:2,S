Exactly.  The condition not lining up with the following code helps
code helps separate the two.

Yes. 
Although I suspect simply not tucking the trailing brace is as
good or better.  I believe not putting the beginning brace at
the beginning of the line is a violation of coding style.
	if (veryverylengthycondition1 &&
	    smallcond2 &&
	    (conditionnumber3a ||
	     condition3b))
	{
		this_is_some_code();
		this_is_some_more_code();
	}
However there is the practical way to solve this if you have
a sufficiently large conditional, or the conditional appears
several times.
	static inline int test_func()
	{
		if (!veryverylengthycondition1)
                	return 0;
  		if (!smallcond2)
			return 0;
		if (conditionnumber3A)
			return 1;
		if (condition3b)
			return 1;
		return 0;
	}
	if (test_func()) {
        	this_is_some_code();
		this_is_some_more_code();
        }
