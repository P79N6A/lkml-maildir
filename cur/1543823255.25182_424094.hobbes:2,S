Those are the softlockup watchdog threads (kernel/softlockup.c).  They run 
once a second and reports a bug if the watchdog failed to run in 10 seconds.  
It is difficult to reproduce but at run 126 (1,260,000 iterations) it finally 
failed.  Note that I am only counting runs that completely miss an entire 
period as a failure for the purposes of this test.  I want to knock out the 
10+ms latencies before I concern myself too much with the >100us failures :-)

next scheduled start is in the past!
Start Latency:  106 us: FAIL
Min Latency:      8 us: PASS
Avg Latency:      4 us: PASS
Max Latency:   10818 us: FAIL

It's interesting, this 10ms latency seems to be the most common result.  I'm 
going to take a look at ingo's tracing script now, more info a bit later...
