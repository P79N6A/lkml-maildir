I would not expect it to, but ran a simple test to check submission
times from 32KiB to 2MiB:
Size		Time (usecs)
----------------------------
2MiB		223
1MiB		112
512KiB		 56
256KiB		 29
128KiB		 14
32KiB		  4
(note that I skipped 64KiB, things got boring). That clearly shows a
linear increase in time, so no scaling problem there.
