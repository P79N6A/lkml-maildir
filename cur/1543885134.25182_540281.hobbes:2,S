Hi Andi,
This series of patches implements the Xen paravirt-ops interface.
It applies to 2.6.21-git3 + ff patches-2.6.21-git3-070501-1.tar.gz.
Changes since the last posting:
 - reviews of xenbus (me), netfront (hch, rusty, herbert xu) and
   blockfront (hch), with most comments addressed.  Netfront review
   revealed a couple of real bugs, and the code for all three is looking
   cleaner overall.
 - Folded bugfix patches into their main patch
 - Lots of little style and other cleanups
There may be a trivial conflict in xen-hvc-console because of the
lguest console.
These patches are now moderately well tested, with several successful
runs through XenSource's regression test suite, and some amount of
non-me testing.  While I wouldn't go into production with a
xen/paravirt_ops kernel right now, it does seem pretty functional.
This series generally restricts itself to Xen-specific parts of the
tree, though it does make a few small changes elsewhere.
It includes:
 - some helper routines for allocating address space and walking pagetables
 - Xen interface header files
 - Core Xen implementation
 - Efficient late-pinning/early-unpinning pagetable handling
 - Virtualized time, including stolen time
 - SMP support
 - Preemption support
 - Batched pagetable updates
 - Xen console, based on hvc console
 - Xenbus
 - Netfront, the paravirtualized network device
 - Blockfront, the paravirtualized block device
Thanks,
	J
