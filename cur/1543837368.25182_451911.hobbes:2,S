I simply described how one ABI (ALSA <-> kernel in this case) can
be stabilized, while new non-ALSA related features (and potentially
unstable ABI) can still be had.
If computer has enough resources, practically every ABI can be
stabilized (if desired) this way - as long as the ABI is PCI slot
related.
That is, I can, for example, stabilize ALSA-kernel interface choosing
(ALSA 1.0.11 + kernel 2.6.17) and I can stabilize TV card interface
using (whatever v4l + kernel 2.6.18), etc,
