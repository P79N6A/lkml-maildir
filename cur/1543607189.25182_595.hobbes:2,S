Subject: [PATCH]  802.1Q VLAN patch, version 1.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The latest version of my 802.1Q VLAN patch is available at:
http://www.candelatech.com/~greear/vlan.html
The 2.4 kernel patch is attached.  This patch should fix the
multicast-reference leak, a crash bug relating to removing
a VLAN device that had been renamed, and some work towards
making VLANs more transparent to snoopy programs (ie tcpdump).
This patch was made against 2.4.13-pre5...  Dave, please
consider this for kernel inclusion.
I welcome any feedback, especially things that will help this
patch get into the kernel...
Thanks,
Ben
