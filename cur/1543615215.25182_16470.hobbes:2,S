I think that the difference is that there is no planning to make sure
that no-one is irreplaceable.  Sure people can be replaced, but it
might take a while.  A subsystem might be unmaintained (or
under-maintained) for a while until some sucker^Wdeveloper puts their
hand up.  That isn't a situation that a "fortune 500 bureaucracy"
would be able to tolerate.  But we seem to cope.
