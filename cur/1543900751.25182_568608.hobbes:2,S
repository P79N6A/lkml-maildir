If there is no the lock, the blkio_delay/swapin_delay might have the latest
value but the count is 1 less than the correct value.

That needs Shailabh Nagar's comments.
What I tried to say is the inconsistent issue is not severe and happened rarely.
The mostly-used scenario is a performance tool reads the data per time-slot in
a loop, so I think it wouldn't hurt the usage model.

seqlock is helpful, but my start point is to save memory space without hurt to application.
As you know, every process (thread) has its own struct task_delay_info.
