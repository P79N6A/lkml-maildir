That means, that this driver has a large (paying?) customer base.
This should be enough reason to put some efforts into fixing it.
At least it should for the (big) companies selling servers based
on this chipset, because it will help their customers a lot and
their own support staff finding latency problems.
So if you don't have the time to fix it, it's simply a problem
with your management ignoring its customers ;-/
