Subject: 2.6.16-rc[34]: resume-from-RAM unreliable

For the past week, I've been trying to keep with the latest -rc*-git*
releases of 2.6.16 on my notebook, and something new in those is
impacting resume-from-RAM.
It works most of the time, but *rarely* when suspended for more
than a few hours (like overnight).  Which makes testing somewhat
challenging, as this is also my main work machine.
Black screen on resume, no response to alt-sysrq-b,
and no convenient serial port in the machine.
Works 100% with 2.6.15 kernels.
If I can figure out anything more that's useful, I'll do so,
but that's all I know about it right now.
Debugging resume on a "legacy free" notebook is not fun.
