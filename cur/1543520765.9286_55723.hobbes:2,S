It might be worth reminding people that some shells (notably bash) will 
check if EUID != UID and reset the EUID to the UID on startup, unless a 
particular option (-p on bash) is given.  IOW, testing the above with a 
setuid shell script won't work unless its startup line is "#! /bin/bash -p" 
(or /bin/sh in place of /bin/bash).
