Hi guys,
Here's a small patch that changes the somewhat ugly line in /proc/cpuinfo:
(before)
model name	: Pentium 75 - 200
(after)
model name	: Pentium Classic
IHMO, this looks much nicer and is how Intel designates these chips on
their sale channels. Also, "75 - 200" duplicates the MHz informational
line anyway. On purely aethestic grounds, mind you. Apply if you wish, but
I won't be asking Linus to include this until he's ready. 
At least be happy I'm playing with the kernel sources instead of flaming
losers =)
