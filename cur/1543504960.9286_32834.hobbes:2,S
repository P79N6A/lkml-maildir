"The SGI Linux Environment with Red Hat Linux 6.0
              dramatically improves the performance of Apache
              Server with TCP/IP stack management software created
              by SGI and included with the SGI 1400L server. Also
              included is the kernel NFS demon patch for improved
              NFS file sharing performance. "
What the heck is "TCP/IP stack management software"?
