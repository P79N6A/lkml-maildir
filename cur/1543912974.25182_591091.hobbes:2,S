However, this is not what is happening here. Jiri has made changes that he has 
licensed solely under the GPLv2. This means that he now becomes the 
licensor - not Mr. Floeter or Mr. Leffler. *BUT* *ONLY* of the version of the 
code containing his changes.
Mr. Floeter *CAN* request that his code be removed from said fork - his code 
is solely licensed (AFAICT and IIRC) under the BSD/ISC license and was only 
covered by the dual-license because it was integrated into a work that 
carried said dual-license. (I'm not sure how well such a revocation would 
work in reality, but it is Mr. Floeters right.)...
(Sam Leffler could do the same - but I'm not sure how well that would carry.)

Correct. Doesn't apply in the case of the code in question (unless the changes 
that were made are so tiny as to not be copyrightable).
In this case the code is question is a modified version, which means that the 
right to distribute said modified version now originates with the person 
holding the copyright on the modifications. (Though their right to distribute 
the code, in such a situation, is lessened quite a bit by the text of the 
license they received the code under)

No misunderstanding, really.
Alan seems to have given a bad example that doesn't apply to the situation 
that is being discussed.

Agreed. When re-distributing an un-modified copy of a work. When distributing 
a modified work, the "work" has the license that the person who made the 
modifications places on it. But individual files and pieces of code will 
still retain their original license - this is how it works.
