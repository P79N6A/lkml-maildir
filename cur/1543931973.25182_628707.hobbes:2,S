Hi,
how can I tell the kernel not to probe DMA for a specific harddisk (e.g. 
hda). My first Drive (hda) is a Compact-Flash Card which can not do DMA. 
The kernel tries at boot to switch to DMA but fails. If I use ide=nodma, 
the kernel boots about 2 minutes faster, but then I can not switch on 
DMA for the second Drive (hdc) which is a normal Harddisk. Do I have to 
live with this 2 minutes waiting time or is there another solution? I 
did not find any kernel-parameter for this purpose.
Sorry if I ask here, but I can not find any solution, and I asked 
already in other groups.
Thank you very much
Olli
