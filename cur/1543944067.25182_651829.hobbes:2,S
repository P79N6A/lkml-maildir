The real application wasn't using yield, but it also didn't get hung up
on the busy-wait loop, that was a mistake by me on Friday. Practically
all the time of that application was spent in the actual workload
loop. I tried adding a yield at the bottom loop, but it didn't make a
significant difference.

Exactly. It made a big impact on the first testcase from Friday, where
the spin-off thread spent the bulk of the time in the busy-wait loop,
with a very small initial workload loop. Thus the yield passed the cpu
over to the other thread who got a chance to run the small workload,
followed by a quick finish by both of them. The better model spends the
bulk of the time in the first workload loop, so yielding doesn't gain
at all the same amount.
I still added it to rule out that it was a factor in the time
differences.
