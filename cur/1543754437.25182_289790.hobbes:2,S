In the real world yes.  On the computer, the front and back doors are
half-consumed by a short-path wormhole that places them right next to
eachother, so not really.  :)

Crowbars don't work in computer security.  The most you can do is slow
the machine down by infinite network requests or CPU hogging (web server
requests take CPU, even to reject) if *everything* else is perfect; but
the goal is to keep them out, since we live in reality and not fairyland
where we can even stop DDoSes from eating network BW.

No, you aim close.  You won't hit it, but you'll get close.

yeah, I'm just very security minded.  Don't mind me much.
