The applet settings show a list of sensors under the libsensors name.
Those are the sensors that work on 2.6.21.1.
However the acpi and i2c section of the two config are

Sorry. Here it is (they are identical in the two config):
Hardware Monitoring support  --->
  <*> Hardware Monitoring support
  <*> Abit uGuru
  <M> VIA686A
  <*> IBM Hard Drive Active Protection System (hdaps)
But I'm quite sure that the only module used is VIA686A (I'm
rebuilding to confirm).

I've attached the lsmod for 2.6.22-rc. I'm not using any of the listed
drivers. However the lm-sensors package is version 2.10.1-3 and
libsensors.so.3.1.1 is on my system too (package libsensors3).
Thanks.
