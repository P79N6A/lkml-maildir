Ah, I was half asleep when doing the change, so I missed
other obvious stuff it seems, like memset of three bytes to
two byte variabe :)
memset on wrong thing (second memset should be applied to str1 of course.)
But as Greg KH said already, whis stuff should be replaced by version from 2.5 instead ;)

New 2.5 code does not have this function at all.
I will look into porting 2.5 changes back to 2.4 tonight. This seems to be proper solution
in this case.
