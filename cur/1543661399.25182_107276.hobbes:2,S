   Am I correct that if I have 10k clients doing their worst tricks, and
   3 * (80k, my default according to the kernel) == 240k, then I have at most
   2.4MB denial of service?  Assuming 60k clients, that is only about 15MB
   of DoS?  If true, that is a fairly small time DoS considering the RAM available
   on today's machines.
Add in the struct sk_buff for each packet as well, which is dependant
upon MSS.  Thus you could make the clients use a super-small MSS to
get more per-packet struct sk_buff overhead.  The list goes on and on.
At least Linux, unlike BSD, makes an attempt to account for the
sk_buff overhead in the limits :-)
