Note that the newer gqviews preload the "next" image (next based on your
previous clicking direction).  If you are clicking sequentially and give
it enough time between images, it will immediately display the next image
when you click on it.
I don't see how even if it were any sort of caching bug or something that
gqview would be able to load them that much faster -- it still has to
decode them at one point or another.
