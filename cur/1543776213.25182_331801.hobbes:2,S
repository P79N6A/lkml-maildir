Hard to measure (I don't have the C skills to add timing to your sample
snippet...), but almost instantly after issuing the command. "time"
states the command takes around 0.733 seconds in total (until the
command returns), the head park happens almost instantly after the
program started, probably after ~300ms).

Right, which usually happens right away on a busy system, especially
when it's using swap (think KDE desktops :) )

Or for a given timeout, whatever happens first. Sounds good to me!
So would this feature require modifications to the IDE layer?
