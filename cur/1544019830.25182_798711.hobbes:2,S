So I've looked a bit at that function, and I wonder why we can't just do 
the "vma_merge()" earlier - before we allocate that whole vma to begin 
with.
We already do that for anonymous mappings _anyway_, using the exact same 
"vma_merge()" function. So how about just expanding on that logic, and 
simplifying everything at the same time?
THIS PATCH IS TOTALLY UNTESTED!
There may be some reason why we didn't do it this way to begin with, but 
this woudl actually seem to be the more logical way to fix the problem: by 
simplifying the whole function to the point where we never try to do that 
"try to merge late and then fix up the fact that we have to free the vma 
we allocated earlier" thing at all!
Hmm? This would remove a more lines than it adds, and actually makes 
things more readable. If it works. Anybody see why it wouldn't?
