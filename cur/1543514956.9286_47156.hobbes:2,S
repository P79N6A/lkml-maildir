Hi all,
We have encountered a situation where we require about 190k of data in
kernel space. We tried to use vmalloc() but the machine crawls for a few
minutes before regaining consciousness.
Are there any tricks to getting kmalloc() to give us what we need (ideally,
two 128k contiguous buffers) or are there any other methods to getting this
to work. Just thought I'd ask before I start rewriting code ...
