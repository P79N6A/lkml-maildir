that's ok.  the sk list (of vcc's) will be seperate from
the atm dev so you can take the vcc w/o relying on a device
to hold the list.
btw, you might get async device 'releases' more often than
you would like.  some atm devices are usb and could be 
unplugged during operation (yes, that's really bad but it
would be wise to be prepared for this.)  i actually have
a cardbus atm interface.  i might eject it accidentally.
