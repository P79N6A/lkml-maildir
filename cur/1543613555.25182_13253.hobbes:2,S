Client should suffice. If you could start something like
tcpdump -s 256 -w tcpdump.out
close to the point at which the error occurs, and send me the
resulting file, then that should be OK. I'm mainly out to check
whether or not the server is the one returning the EIO error, or
possibly if it is returning bad post-op attributes. Those are the only
remaining possibilities if hard mounts are being used.
BTW: could you also tell me a bit about the server? Is this an ext[23]
partition and knfsd? I'm still a bit wary of ReiserFS...
Cheers,
