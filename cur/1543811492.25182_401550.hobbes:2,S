The idea behind this code is that we start out with the maximum amount of 
data we'd want to copy, and then reduce it to prevent copying more data
than we should for any other reason we can think of. 
The reason I do it this way is that the hardware for instance may increase 
the number of bytes that can be copied, just because another byte came in. 
The rest of the system may INCREASE the number of bytes we can put in the buffer
because someone copied bytes out of the buffer or something like that 
(probably doesn't happen like that because it's called a flip-buffer, but 
whatever).  
Both of these "races" are not really races: We'd end up copying less data this 
time, and we'd copy the rest the next time. 
So, if the modern flip buffer stuff expects us to provide the exact number
of bytes we prepared the flip buffer for we shouldn't adjust the number of chars
copied after preparing the flip buffer. 
So indeed the check for the end of the hardware buffer needs to go before the
prepare flip string. 
Approved!
	Roger.
