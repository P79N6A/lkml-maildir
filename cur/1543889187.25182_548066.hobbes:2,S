Cunning, but I guess the regular (less than 5 seconds apart)
reads/writes during the encoding process would cause prefetching to
hold off, no? I had used nice and ionice to reduce the encoder
priority, which made desktop apps pretty responsive, except when they
had to hit swap. If swap prefetch is using the idle io-priority I
suppose it would hardly affect performance if it kicked in during such
use, since it would operate in between the encoder reads anyway
(assuming the encoder is at higher ioprio), right ?
