Subject: Possible problem in activate_task() with priority inheritance in 2.6.17-rc1-mm1

In activate_task() the call to recalc_task_prio() is guarded by 
!rt_task().  This will suppress the recalculation of normal_prio for non 
RT tasks that just happen to be at real time priority as a result of 
priority inheritance.  Is that intentional?
