Well, thrashing a register at any time under the user
just because an interrupt happened is even less sane ;-)

I see. And finally we know that the problem with the
processor and that Intel changed the spec to conform
to what the hardware does but is rather coy about it.

But if the bug is also affects Windows DOS box, it means that
V86 is affected too, no? 
I'd like to know what OS/2 did. The DOS boxes and 16 bit mode
DPMI applications ran very well and it was very stable, despite
the fact that the kernel spent its time switching between 16
and 32 bit modes (for example, almost all device drivers were 
16 bit code, but the drivers for DOS emulation were 32 bit).
But I removed it from all my machines several years ago.

Of which specs? It is never clearly stated in the whole
4 volume doc of the architecture. Only in an obscure
specification change...
