Hello
Can someone tell me the meaning of the _IOC_SIZE(cmd) value?
ex:
on the user side:
ioctl(fd,_MY_IOCTL,&buffer) (sizeof buffer = 1000)
on the kernel side
ioctl_function(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, 
ulong arg)
..
size = _IOC_SIZE(cmd)
and here size = 4 ??? I would expected 1000...no?
Perhaps my ioctl process is totaly wrong?
