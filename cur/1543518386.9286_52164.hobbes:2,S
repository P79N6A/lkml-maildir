threading libraries are magical. They often do things that nobody else
does: threading libraries are also the main reason why things like
"sigreturn()" have to have a well-defined meaning (in theory, normal user
mode should never care about signal stack layout, but user-mode thread
libraries tend to use the signal stack for their own thread switching).
This is going to continue to be an issue, but it's going to get less over
time. Fewer programs use their own threading libraries and are starting to
just rely on the standard libc pthreads support. Which is good.

This is why we want to have the ELF dynamic capabilities in the first
place. No question about that, and I'm certainly not arguing against the
beauty of weak symbols and dynamic linking as a way to do things you
couldn't easily do otherwise.
But we're still talking about a small small subset of "normal programs".
