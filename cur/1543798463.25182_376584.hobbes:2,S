What?  These are symlinks, not files.  Why would you want to read the
name of the block device from a file and then go have to look that
location up, instead of just following the symlink?

Those devices do have their own unique directory.  Look at the pointer
above :)
The point here is that multiple class devices and block devices can bind
to a single "real device" in the system, and we need to handle that
representation properly.  We have had the symlink for a while now, and I
just forgot to put the proper name on the block device one, to match up
with the class device naming.
