I realize that.

Yes, but not always.  Many many people download binary RPM's and
tarballs now, and have little if any trouble.  Granted, larger
commercial packages are more susceptible to trouble, but the
solution IMHO is not to bundle libs...

Yes.  Unfortunately, their products become labeled "bloatware" by
doing so.  I've followed several major commercial software
releases, and it seems that their apps are always linked to
obsolete libraries, usually a major version or more behind what
is current.
Why they do that, is likely to cover the most amount of machines
out there, as newer machines can usually use older libraries in
wrappers.
What I've found from discussing major commercial software
packages for Linux with anyone that has used them, is that any
given package performs poorly compared to it's windows
equivalent, and is a huge resource hog.
That is fine by me though, as it just disadvantages the app, and
makes open-source free alternatives more attractive in the
future.
Unfortunately, we are stuck now using bloatware and waiting for
GPL'd replacements, or we're stuck using M$.

No, I'm not really complaining, just pointing out some
disadvantages.  And I did think it out well.  I'm refering to the
average person's home computer, or even one being used in the
workplace in a manner similar to what Windows 95 or NT would be
being used in - a single user system.
Obviously a multiuser system that has multiple people logged in,
using Star, would benefit, however such a system is the
exception, not the rule.  A user workstation using Star, wastes a
lot of memory IMHO.  The best solution of course is open-source,
however I think other possibilities are viable as well.  Perhaps
releasing a "general" release which works on systems with the
included libs, and another release which is compiled to the
latest up to date libraries in the latest distributions.

Ok, I'll take your word for that, but doesn't demand loading
prevent unneeded code/data from being loaded in the first place,
even in a static binary?

Yes, that is basically the problem.  Commercial software doesn't
fit well into the distribution of the week scheme we've grown to
love.  I think this is good though as it will only fuel the
open-source movement.  I would rather PAY $50 to get Staroffice
source and compile it for my system, than get the binaries for
free and have to pay $500 to upgrade my system to use it.
>It is unfortunate that the first trial ballons will take a lot of heat.
Agreed.  Star does take heat, it is a great program IMHO though.
I just wish it was useable.  The Win32 version works very well on
my system - whereas the Linux version is more of a slideshow.

A great idea.  It would also be nice if they'd try installing
their software on at least the last three releases of each major
distribution for compatibility checks.  Perhaps making minor
modifications to the code to ensure that it at least installs
half decently.
Things will change in the future though, so I'm not really
worried.  I'm just glad that companies are actually porting to
Linux in the first place.
Take care,
