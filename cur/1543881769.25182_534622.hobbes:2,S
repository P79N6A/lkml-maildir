I mean EF-Segments. Cause we got a kernel oops as we accidentally used ioremap_nocache on a EF-Segment address.
Before that usage the EF-Segments weren't secured, afterwards they were.
We use now ioremap which does the high low mem check, but I was a bit confused that NX was not active before.
But I can't provide any further informations about the system, cause it was more or less support for a customer.
Ciao Thilo
