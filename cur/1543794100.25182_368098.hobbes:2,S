Am chasing another issue - once I got past that, it wouldn't boot at all.
Grub would act like it was loading, then 2 seconds or so later, grub would
start up again.  My first guess was CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA=y, but I ruled that
out.  More detail once I've done some more binary searching and ruled out
self-inflicted idiocy....
