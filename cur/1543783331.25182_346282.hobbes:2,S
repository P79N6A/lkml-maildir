Subject: [PATCH] aacraid:  2.6.13 aacraid bad BUG_ON fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This was noticed by Doug Bazamic and the fix found by Mark Salyzyn at
Adaptec.
There was an error in the BUG_ON() statement that validated the
calculated fib size which can cause the driver to panic.
