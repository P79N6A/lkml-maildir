Hi
I've noticed that ifconfig shows a base address and an interrupt
number.. However, I can't get that base address to correspond to
anything in /proc/iomem, which means that I can't determine which PCI
device (in this case) it corresponds to (guess the base address is
virtual). What I want is to find a way to get the PCI bus and device no
for the network device, but is this at all possible without altering the
kernel?
