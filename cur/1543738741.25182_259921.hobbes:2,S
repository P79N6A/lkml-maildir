Dynamic priority is the current priority the scheduler has allocated to 
a task. It uses it to decide which task to go next; the lower the number 
the better it's priority so it goes first. The subtracting 100 and 60 is 
just what the userspace tools do to represent an obviously complicated 
value.
Please don't top post. It makes it hard to respond appropriately and 
follow email threads.
