I agree.  I think I found the real problem.
I'm going to test it and sleep on it, but here is the correct patch,
I think.  Hot off the press.
Give us 16 hours  :-)
The problem was that the chip actually likes a count of 0x10000 for
a 64K s/g, but the original author programmed 0 instead of 0x10000
for that amount (I don't know why).
I'll send a better patch tomorrow.  This one depends on a byte count
multiple of 2.  Though according to the chip docs, it ignores bit 0
of the byte count anyway (and the address for that matter).  So I
think this is functionally correct.  But I think the xcount variable
is superfluous.
