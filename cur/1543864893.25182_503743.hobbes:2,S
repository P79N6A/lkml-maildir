Might, and has.  For a good time, take journal_info out of  
per_call_chain() in the patch set and watch it helpfully and loudly  
wet itself.  There really really are bits of thread_struct which are  
strictly thread-local-storage, of a sort, for a kernel call path.    
Sharing them, even only through cooperate scheduling, is fatal.   
link_count is another obvious one.
They're also the only ones I've bothered to discover so far :).

Indeed.
Right now the per-fibril uses of task_struct members are left inline  
in task_struct and are copied on fibril switches.
We *could* put them in thread_info, at the cost of stack pressure, or  
hang them off task_struct in their own struct to avoid the copies, at  
the cost of indirection.  I didn't like imposing a cost on paths that  
don't use fibrils, though, so I left them inline.
(I think you know all this.  I'm clarifying for the peanut gallery, I  
hope.)
