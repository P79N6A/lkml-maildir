I don't think it really matters.  It's quite common in that code to do
unlocked, racy update to statistics such as this.  Because on those
rare occasions where a race does happen, there's a small glitch in the
reclaim logic which nobody will notice anyway.
Of course, this does need to be done with some care, to ensure the
glitch _will_ be small.  If such a race would cause the scanner to go
off and reclaim 2^32 pages, well, that's not so good.

We've unnecessarily moved a pile of other things inside the locked
region as well, needlessly extending the lock hold times.

You'll note that the code which _uses_ these values does so without
holding the lock.  So get_scan_ratio() sees incoherent values of
recent_scanned[0] and recent_scanned[1].  As is common in this code,
that is OK and deliberate.
It's also racy here:
	if (unlikely(zone->recent_scanned[0] > anon / 4)) {
		spin_lock_irq(&zone->lru_lock);
		zone->recent_scanned[0] /= 2;
		zone->recent_rotated[0] /= 2;
		spin_unlock_irq(&zone->lru_lock);
	}
failing to recheck the comparison after taking the lock..
