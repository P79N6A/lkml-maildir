Does anyone have any patches for 2.5.69 that will
enable me to use my Gateway 9300's ATI Rage Mobility video chip
with the console frame buffer ?
I tried to modify the code from some patches i found for the 2.4.x
kernels, but the result was an odd fractal graphic growth being
displayed at boot time.
