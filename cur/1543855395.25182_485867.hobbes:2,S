Hi Andi,
The kernel 2.6.18.3 runs very well on my x64 server with 2 CPU's and
8G memory; however kernel 2.6.16.32 kernel panic(Kernel panic - not
syncing: Attempted to kill init) under the stress test. After I use
mem=4000M for kernel 2.6.16.32, the kernel panic doesn't happen under
stress test.
This bug also happens with latest sles10 kernel(2.6.16.21-0.25-smp),
which is based on 2.6.16.21.
Do you know what patch fixed this bug between  2.6.16.32 and 2.6.18.3?
Then we could backport the patch to both 2.6.16.32 and sles10 kernel.
Thanks,
Forrest
