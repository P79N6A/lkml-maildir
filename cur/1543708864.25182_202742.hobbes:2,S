I have a Pinnacle TV/FM stereo card. The FM tuner audio chip MSP34xx is 
not found with 2.6.3-mm4. If i revert the bk-i2c.patch then it is 
detected and i have FM stereo sound again.
 From dmesg after the reverse:
bttv0: i2c: checking for MSP34xx @ 0x80... found
msp34xx: init: chip=MSP3451G-A2 +nicam +simple +radio
