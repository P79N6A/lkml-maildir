One might think so, but 2.2.8 only seems unstable on certain machine
configurations. I've had a highly loaded db running on 2.2.8 since it
first came out. I load-tested it pretty thoroughly before putting it into
production, and of course now that it's in it's hard to upgrade it. But
not a single crash or hiccup.
The machine is a pure-SCSI machine with a caching controller, and most of
the complaints I've heard were for IDE systems (or perhaps slow SCSI
disks?). Shrug.
