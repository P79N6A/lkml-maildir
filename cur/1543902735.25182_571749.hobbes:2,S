Please distinguish between "cater to" and "support". If the kernel
didn't worry about supporting out-of-tree code, then why would there
be loadable module at all?
Christian Ehrhardt already pointed to two reasons for loadable LSMs
that are sufficient to justify keeping them - so you can replace them
iteratively while you're developing them or choose between
alternatives.
Another twist is to use a tool to generate the module from a
policy-definition file; this could be done at boot-time or could be
done to replace the current policy on a running system (perhaps to add
a new domain corresponding to a newly added service). Yes, this would
need to be done with a lot of care, but part of providing mechanism
(rather than policy) is enabling people to use the mechanism in the
ways they prefer.
