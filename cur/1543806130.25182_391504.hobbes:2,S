Just to clarify, it looks like we can kill this line because
de_thread() also does list_add_tail(current, &init_task.tasks).
But please note that it (and probably __ptrace_link() above)
does list_del(current->task) first, and current->task may have
very stale values after old leader called dup_task_struct().
SET_LINKS() in copy_process() does nothing with ->tasks in a
CLONE_THREAD case.
Oleg.
