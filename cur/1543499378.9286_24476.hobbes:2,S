An opinion about /dev :
In the old system /dev is a collection of "links" from
filenames to device numbers (major:minor).
With devfs it could be a collection of links from
filenames to /devfs/* entries.
The first one is done with device files , the second
with symbolic links. In both cases /dev is a normal directory.
In second case devfs is mounted somewhere else.
With this second case there is no problem with policy, 
since in that regard is is equal to the first case.
The difference is that the "kernel connection" is not based
on device numbers , but devfs created names.
The good side is that ... 
I think I forgot it :-)
But this way adding a new disk into system doesn't cause
/dev entries to "skip" ( point to a different physical device
than a day before ).
Well chew on this , I'm going for a coffee ...
