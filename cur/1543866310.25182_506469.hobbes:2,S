Subject: [patch 0/3] 2.6.20 fix for PageUptodate memorder problem (try 2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/8/97

Still no independent confirmation as to whether this is a problem or not.
Updated some comments, added diffstats to patches, don't use __SetPageUptodate
as an internal page-flags.h private function.
I would like to eventually get an ack from Hugh regarding the anon memory
and especially swap side of the equation, and a glance from whoever put the
smp_wmb()s into the copy functions (Was it Ben H or Anton maybe?)
Thanks,
Nick
