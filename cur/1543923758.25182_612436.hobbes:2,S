Thanks for confirming this. I found that Windows also allocates only
one MSI message for such device, though I know nobody here is
interested in Windows. :-P This also confirms from another perspective
that supporting only one MSI message is actually due to the APIC
limitation.

I agree. Accessing HW registers across PCIe is not quite desirable
since it takes relatively long time especially for reads. In some
situation, if multiple MSI messages were supported, even a single
interrupt would handle multiple events and avoid reading some HW
status register to determine the type of event since the message data
has such information. Hence the performance should be improved quite a
bit.
