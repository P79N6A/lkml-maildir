I am working on that.  What broke the drivers was the removal of
the assumption that irq == vector.  Which was a bad hack and never
always true.

I am just saying that if you don't have the infrastructure you need 
you cannot implement things correctly.  It is no fault of the driver
authors.  Except possibly not standing up and asking for some
infrastructure to do what needs to be done.

The kernel changes the value at runtime, based upon user input.
I assume your mirror register needs to be updated after every change.
Since the kernel changes the value at runtime, and since a different
register needs to be written to, I can't quite use the generic code I
have written as is.

Ok.  I guess I was reading something in that wasn't there.  So see a
similarity and say it looks like that can be generalized.  I look and
I don't see what having a magic DWIM enable irq interface would help
with.  The counter argument is essentially that if you have multiple
options implemented but some of them are buggy
