In English, we use something called the "future tense."  "Does anyone help
me?"  Is a present tense question... the appropriate question would be
"Will anyone help me?"  :)

For a contribution to the Linux kernel, I believe that you have to email
the patch to whatever developer is in control of that part of the kernel
for whatever feature you'd like.  Only catch:  It's gotta be against the
_latest_ kernel.  They won't patch older versions for you ;).
The person who would release the kernel is officially supposed to be Linus
Torvalds, but I get a feeling that what he'll do is release it and someone
else does the linux-kernel-announce official release bulletin.
