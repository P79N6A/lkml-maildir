Well, I'm using (checks /etc/inittab) 54 VTs, which is considerably higher 
than 25, and I'm running out of VTs.  I keep finding I have to close one to
use something else.  I'm thinking about making more, just not sure which
key bindings to give them.
I could easily use more than 64 -- what I do to manage them is I make 
groups of 9 VTs using the number pad keys plus a modifier.
Alt-1 to 9 are for web browsing.  No modifier, just 1 to 9 jump to shell 
prompts in ~/src (customised getty that logins for me).  Ctrl-1 to 9, are
shell prompts beginning in ~/.
I've considered using the "screen" program but I have found that swapping
between programs isn't as nice.
I do think 64 is too little, but I think 256 would be sufficient -- but I'm
sure it could be possible that 256 isn't enough for someone.

Is there some reason why the memory could not be swapped out?  Or could
memory onboard the video card be used to store each scroll back somehow?
(I'm often in text mode w/o X and my video card has 8 megs of RAM)
Really two megs of memory makes very little difference if you look at how
much the applications running on each VT take up.  Even ash is likely to
take up more than 32kb (and it may be possible for shells to be swapped out,
but I have found that they're not ..).
