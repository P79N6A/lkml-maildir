request_region returns a pointer to the newly allocated resource when
it succeds, and NULL when it failed. It's the opposite logic
check_region uses.
Or am I *that* blind ?
Without this patch, the driver happily requests all EISA IO space, and
exits without any probing.

Ok, what can I do ?
System is a dual PII-300, with two integrated PCI AIC-7xxx.
Moreover, I have one 1740 and one 2740, which crashes at probe time.
Is there any trace you want me to put in ?
Thanks,
        M.
