Hello,
Since I installed the 2.4.19-pre8 kernel on my Athlon 1,3 GHz machine.
The machine wont halt and poweroff any more it just reboots.
Systemhardware
AMD Irongate chipset
NVidia 2MX (nvidia drivers 2880)
SB 64-gold - oss drivers (4front)
SCSI Adaptec 2940UW with A7880 (reproted by kernel)
3COM 3C509 (combo)
RH7.1 with Ximian Gnome 1.4
What could be the problem?
I am currently at work so I cannot answer specific answers because I have that
system not available right now.
For more info, just ask.
Hilbert
PS The 3com card complains about a "transpoder" x times.
