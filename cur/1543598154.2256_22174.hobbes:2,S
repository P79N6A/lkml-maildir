Hi
I have a Dual PII with 2GB-RAM on a GX-Chipset Mainboard (Tyan Thunder
100)
Until yesterday that machine ran with Kernel 2.2.19. After upgrading to
2.4.(4/9) it got about 20times SLOWER than with 2.2.19.
After i switched "High Memory-Support" to "OFF"(4GB Before) the speed went
to normal, but now less than half RAM is used.
Any suggestions?
(Kernel 2.2.19 ran with "Maximum Physical Memory = 2GB")
Bis denn
