Good Day,
I think this debate boils down ti a few issues that could be easily resolved.
  As far as I can tell, the OpenGL Framebuffer is for an accelerated
console in 2D
  While expecting Intel, ATI and Nvidia to cough up specs for their
cards, a simpler
    implementation of OpenGL for the console could be offered up.
  The existing system works well for most people and a newer system could either
    tranisition from the base or take over if the installer or distro
supports it.
  I don't see the hardware folks releasing all the details, but I can
see them releasing a
    mini-GL driver ala the quake era in LGPL or other comparable liscense.
  It just seems that those of us with Expensive GPUs should be able to
get a better
    console experience.
  I think a main goal would be to allow the existing code to
gracefully release the hardware
    for a different driver to take over, be it a Xorg driver, a GLX
driver, an Open Source driver or
    a binary driver that 'taints' the kernel.  I want X to release to
the console in some cases
    and I want the consoles basic driver to release to the Xorg driver.
Most 'power users' run the binary drivers just fine.
I hope it makes sense to you guys.  I love Linux and want it to get better.
Just as the static /dev gave way to udev, the basic console should
make/prepare the way
    for an accelerated console that uses newer and more powerful
grapics cards to better
    use.
Thank You for reading.
Regards,
           Ian
