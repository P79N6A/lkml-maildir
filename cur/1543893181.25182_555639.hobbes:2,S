I presume the heirs of the dead people could change the license.  And
if they have no heir, then there is no-one to sue for breach of
copyright, so I assume the copyright lapses.
And I wouldn't be surprised if there were some legal precedent that
allowed for some process whereby we could make a "best effort" to
contact copyright holders (including registered paper letters and
entries in the "Public Notices" section of major newspapers) and if
no-one stepped forward to claim copyright in a reasonable period of
time we could assume that the copyright had lapsed.  But you would
need to ask a lawyer, and it would be different in different
countries.
But I think this is largely academic.  You only need a fairly small
number of fairly significant contributors to say "no" and the rest of
the process would be pointless.  And at last count, the number of
kernel people who were not keen on GPLv3 was fairly high.  Of course
no-one knows for certain yet what the final GPLv3 will be, and maybe
lots of people would change their mind when it comes out.
There would certainly be value in a straw-pole once GPLv3 was out and
had been discussed for a while - to see if a license change to GPLv3
would be accepted by a majority of current developers.  Doing that
would at least provide a clear statistic to point people at.
