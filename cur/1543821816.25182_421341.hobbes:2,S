That was it. With mode vga=0x318 (1024x768
"16m
colours") no matter what colour depth I set X to
the display will be
incorrect. Set to 24bits every
4th (not 5th, that was my bad estimation)
vertical
line is omitted. This is because the framebuffer
is really using
32bits/pixel.
Using mode vga=0x317 (1024x768 "64k colours")
and X set
to 16bits colour depth everything is OK.
This is really an X fbdev driver
problem... It
should use 32bits/pixel by padding the last byte.
I will write
Xorg about this.

[I tried this
first, and as expected X's vesa
driver works.]
Thanks Antonino!
