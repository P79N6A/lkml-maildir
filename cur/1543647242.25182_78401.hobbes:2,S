OK, see your point here.

I look at it the other way around. I want to make it clear that there
exist a separate Config file for a given subset of files. The normal
approach is to group files based on their filenames.
Therefore I prefer a fixed suffix, as opposed to a fixed prefix.
ls rrunner*
should show me not only the implementation [.c + .h] but also
the configuration.
The only reason I stick with the .conf prefix for the main per-directory
configuration file is to have a common suffix on all config files.
So I would suggest:
Config.conf		<= Main entry in any directory
sensible-name.conf	<= Any group of related files
ls *.conf 	list all configuration files.
ls rrunner*	list all files spcific for rrunner
It's so easy to have opinions about naming ;-)
