This is potentially an issue with the default Unicode map. It appears that
things it doesn't like - it doesn't show. I experienced the same problem
with Hebrew characters which I use - and just disappeared after I switched
to 2.1.x.
My solution was to switch back to the dumb Unicode map (or, if you have a
more accurate map, use it). It goes something like
'loadunimap /usr/lib/kbd/consoletrans/def.uni', assuming the map is
installed in its default location. 'loadunimap' is from the kbd package.
Please let me know if that solved your problem. It might be a good idea to
add this to the Changes file, if that is indeed the case.
