Not for O_SYNC.  For ext2, *every* O_SYNC append to a file involves
seeking between inodes and indirect blocks and data blocks.  With ext3
with data journaling enabled, the synchronous part of the IO is a
single sequential write to the journal.  The async writeback will
affect throughput, yes, but since it is done in the background, it can
do tons of optimisations: if you extend a file a hundred times with
O_SYNC, then you are forced to journal the inode update a hundred
times but the writeback which occurs later need only be done once.
For async traffic, you're quite correct.  For synchronous traffic, the
writeback later on is still async, and the synchronous costs really do
often dominate, so the net effect over time is still a big win.
Cheers,
 Stephen
