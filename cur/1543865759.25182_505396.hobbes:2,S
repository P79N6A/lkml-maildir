Really? Including the 'Scanner driver' card which arrived with my
scanner?
Is that like the 'RAID' card which is obviously RAID to the user, and
not at all IDE?

Crap. What we should have done is fix the tools so that when you go to
enable USB_STORAGE, it either prompts you or automatically turns on
SCSI. I saw versions of our tcl xconfig a _decade_ ago which were
capable of this, but we never cared enough to merge it -- although I
_thought_ our new xconfig could do it these days.

Well that's a shame, because any sane person would realise that most
humans interact with kernel configuration only through a distribution.

No, really. Eric's Aunt Tillie can go screw herself backwards with a
chainsaw. I care about _my_ use of configuration, and mostly my
requirement is that I want to turn something _off_ either because it
doesn't work, or I want it modular so I can hack on it, or because I'm
trying to cut down kernel size and I don't want it.
The proliferation of 'select' has made that a _complete_ pain in the
wossname, apparently for the benefit of some hypothetical relative of a
gun nut, who doesn't actually care because in general she doesn't
configure her own kernel anyway.
Russell is right -- using 'select' just turns the problem backwards,
pessimising it for the _common_ case.
