old egcs patched to compile at 64 bit or gcc 3.1 -m64

This is different fron kernel, you need to compile a 64 bit glibc (use
2.2.5 sources), and so on for all shared libraries you need, then you can
compile a 64 bit executable.
I just should add it will be slower than a 32 bit executable  and a little
bigger, so if you are not sure you need 64 bit because you binary will use
more than 3.6 GB RAM itself, you do not need a 64 bit executable.
