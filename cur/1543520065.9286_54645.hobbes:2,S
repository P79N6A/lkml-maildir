But I did mention that we would be using the standard call in that
case. Currently there is nothing that can detect the memory size
perfectly.  E801 _does_ fail on many systems. The question now
is whether there have been failures with E820. So, maybe E801
should be off by default. Most of the new software use E820, too.

I don't know of a system with E820 and a broken E801 at present.
