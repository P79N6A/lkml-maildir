Yep. There are a lot of things, not part of -Wall. To find 'need coffee'
errors, I use:
	-Wall -Werror -Wstrict-prototypes -Wwrite-strings -Wshadow \
	-Wsign-compare -Wno-trigraphs
        plus...
	-fno-builtin -fno-common -fomit-frame-pointer.
I also use -march=1486 so it will boot. Some machines don't like
`cmov` and other stuff the compiler may emit.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
