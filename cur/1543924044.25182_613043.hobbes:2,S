Subject: [PATCH] show right output for cpuinfo

in x86_64 smp systems, a regression was introduced a few days after 2.6.23,
on its way to 2.6.23. Bisection leads me to commit
92cb7612aee39642d109b8d935ad265e602c0563.
The problem is that the output of 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' shows 0 as the id of
all cpus of a smp system. As far as I know, this only happens on x86_64
systems.
This problem was first noticed by Ravikiran. A simple patch follows
