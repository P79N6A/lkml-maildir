It all makes a lot more sense with the change to set ppc_md.log_error
to pSeries_log_error.  I do wonder why we need a ppc_md function
pointer for that though, given how pSeries-specific the error log
format is.

This looks to me like the setting of rtas_error_log_max should be done
much earlier, in pSeries_init_early, say.  Shouldn't we be using the
rtas_error_log_max variable in __fetch_rtas_last_error, too, rather
than the constant RTAS_ERROR_LOG_MAX?

Netlink is the usual solution to this sort of problem.  I think it
would be reasonable to printk RTAS error events with a severity of
fatal and maybe even of error.  Warnings and events should just get
sent to rtasd.
Oh, and it would be useful to have a comment in the code that calls
__fetch_rtas_last_error that says that we are only calling it if the
RTAS call could not perform its function due to a hardware error.  In
other words the -1 return isn't a generic "didn't work" code but more
specifically a "hardware error" code.
Paul.
