Short answer, about 1.5KB on a 1GB system of which 1.3KB is statically 
defined in the 3 struct zones on a 1 node x86 system.
Longer answer that I hopefully have not made any mistakes in - There is 
the zone overhead which is statically sized and a runtime overhead which 
depends on the amount of memory in the system. The additional zone 
overhead is the overhead for additional freelists (larger struct 
free_area) and is as follows;
(MIGRATE_TYPES-1) * sizeof(list_head) * (MAX_ORDER-1)
so, on 32 bit in general, thats
4 * 8 * 10 = 320 bytes per zone (would be 240 bytes if MIGRATE_RESERVE is
 				sufficient for higher order allocations
 				instead of MIGRATE_HIGHALLOC)
on x86 with DMA, Normal and HighMem, thats 1280 bytes. On a NUMA system, 
it's 1280 bytes per node. On 64 bit, it would be double because of the 
larger pointer size. At worst, I guess you are looking at 3KB per node.
The size of the bitmap for the flags depends on the amount of memory. On 
FLATMEM and DISCONTIG, it's 3 bits per MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES spanned by the 
zones (note spanned, not present). On a 1GiB system without holes on an 
x86 with MAX_ORDER of 11, that would be 96 bytes. The calculation is more 
complex for sparsemem but will be at least 4 bytes per active section for 
a pointer and another 4 bytes for most bitmaps. I have a patch that uses 
the pointer itself when the bitmap is small enough to be contained in 4 
bytes (which is usually is) so it could be just 4 bytes per active section 
(4 bytes per 16MB on powerpc for example).

The main situation where I think it would be desirable to disable 
anti-fragmentation is for zones that are smaller than 
MIGRATE_TYPES*MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES and this is for performance reasons to 
avoid regularly entering __rmqueue_fallback(). However, that situation 
could be automatically detected and handled by having 
allocflags_to_migratetype() always return MIGRATE_UNMOVABLE for small 
zones and similar for get_pageblock_migratetype(). There would be no need 
for a sysctl.
If a sysctl was available for cases where profiles showed a problem with 
the bitmap for example, it would work by having 
allocflags_to_migratetype() and get_pageblock_migratetype() always return 
MIGRATE_UNMOVABLE so it would not be totally different code paths that are 
being executed in the enabled/disabled cases.
