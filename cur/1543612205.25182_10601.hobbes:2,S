Andi, thanks a lot for the insight, I will try your suggestions.  
WCCP is a Web Cache Communication Protocol; it is used by Cisco
routers to forward traffic to proxies. What is confusing is that
send() generates an ID for packets with DF set, at least when
used in a way like Squid uses it. I briefly checked Squid source
code and didn't find any places where it would disable MTU Path
discovery.

Ok, an intercompatibility issue. :-)
