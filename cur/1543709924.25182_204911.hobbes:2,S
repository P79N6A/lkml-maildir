this patch locks up the VM.
To reproduce, run the attached, very simple test-mmap.c code (as
unprivileged user) which maps 80MB worth of shared memory in a
finegrained way, creating ~19K vmas, and sleeps. Keep this process
around.
Then try to create any sort of VM swap pressure. (start a few desktop
apps or generate pagecache pressure.) [the 500 MHz P3 system i tried
this on has 256 MB of RAM and 300 MB of swap.]
stock 2.6.4-rc2-mm1 handles it just fine - it starts swapping and
recovers. The system is responsive and behaves just fine.
with 2.6.4-rc2-mm1 + your objrmap patch the box in essence locks up and
it's not possible to do anything. The VM is looping within the objrmap
functions. (a sample trace attached.)
Note that the test-mmap.c app does nothing that a normal user cannot do. 
In fact it's not even hostile - it only has lots of vmas but is
otherwise not actively pushing the VM, it's just sleeping. (Also, the
test is a very far cry from Oracle's workload of gigabytes of shm mapped
in a finegrained way to hundreds of processes.) All in one, currently i
believe the patch is pretty unacceptable in its present form.
