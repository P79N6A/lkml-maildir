if you want I can revert the patch and make sure thats what caused it
as when i applied this i also updated from cfs v18 to v19
but v18 was working fine before on rc7 i only updated to current -git
way I saw it was
-rc7-cfs-v18 working
-rc7-git-cfs-v18 broken booting with slub
-rc7-git-cfs-v19 working with slub with this patch
