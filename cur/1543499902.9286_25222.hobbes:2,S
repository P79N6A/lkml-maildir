    I finally gave up on trying to wedge a kernel, libc4, an installer, a shell,
    gpm, and a wad of pcmcia goop (for bootstrapping Linux onto my VAIO 505fx)
    onto a regular uncompressed 1.44 floppy today, and reworked my initrd'ed
    ...
Hmm. I wonder why you need gpm? For most purposes selection
(e.g. selection-1.7a) is just as good as gpm, and here
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root        67758 Jan 20 11:40 /usr/bin/gpm
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root        13160 Mar 19  1997 /usr/bin/selection
selection is a lot smaller.
