Hi Willy,
> Changelog from 2.4.32-hf32.1 to 2.4.32-hf32.2
Which of those are you going to push to Marcelo for inclusion?
I've found two subtle IPVS bugs (using a persistency setup on SMP 
combined with sharp TCP state transition timeouts), one of which is 
fixed in my tree and has been running in production for over 1 month 
now. The other is still in discussion phase with Horms and Julian Anastasov.

This is correct. Funny, It never triggered on my systems, but I only 
have a bonding setup on three SMP systems, probably none of them using ALB.
Thanks for your hard work,
Roberto Nibali, ratz
