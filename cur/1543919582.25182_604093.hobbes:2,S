That line came in on request from Andi/Novell.
And I tested it regioursly with several of my cross compile setups.
But never with native - silly me.
But that patch has other issues too so I will withdraw it
until I have fixed the other annoying issues.
We are simply to gcc happy in the top-lvel makefile and
we run it several times for no good reasons when we for example do
maouldes_install or headers_isntall.
