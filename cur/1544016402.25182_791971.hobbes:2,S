You're right; I'm not convinced we need the flush in ext4 (or ext3) at
all.  We write the data blocks, *then* we call ext4_write_inode(),
which will force a commit.  Now, if we apply that patch which
optimizes out commits if there are no dirty blocks, then we'll be
trouble, because we won't know for sure whether or not
ext4_write_inode() will have forced a journal commit.
If we optimize out the journal commit when there are no blocks
attached to the transaction, we could change the patch to only force a
flush if inode->i_state did not have I_DIRTY before the call to
sync_inode().  Does that sound sane?

I'm not sure what you mean; if the barrier operation isn't flushing
all of the caches all the way out to the iron oxide, it's not going to
be working properly no matter where it is being called, whether it's
in ext4_sync_file() or in jbd2's journal_submit_commit_record().
