This code is horribly broken. Don't change the kernel because this code is
broken.
First it adds a second, but then it subtracts up to a second. Just before
the second boundary, this code can burn CPU like crazy, with each wait being
just a few nanoseconds.
What is the intent of this code? Is it to wait "up to a second, possibly for
no time at all" or is to wait "for at least a second"? If so, why are you
zeroing the nanosecond count?
