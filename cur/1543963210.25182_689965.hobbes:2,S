I'm glad, that we can agree on this.

Granted as I said before.

Yes, it should have been done better.
So we made mistakes, but is this a justification for magnifying that
to be the major contribution to the end of the universe ?
Definitely not.
I have no problem to admit a mistake, but I vehemently fight the way
how such incidents are artificially exxagerated in the recent past.
I personally have broad enough shoulders to cope with the fact that
bashing on x86 maintainers and trying to play them out against each
other is currently en vogue.
But I have no understanding at all for the snotty way how valuable
contributors are treated even when the responsibility of the actual
merging of their imperfect patch is out of their scope.
Thanks,
