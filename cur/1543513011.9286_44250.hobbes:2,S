Consider this course of action:
setserial /dev/ttySx uart none
  resource not released
setserial /dev/ttySx port 0
  resource still not released
(tried as of 2.3.20)
The AX25-HOWTO instructs people to use
setserial /dev/ttySx uart none to make serial
release a port before using another driver
for that port, that's why it's breaking systems.

That's what people are using and now breaks.

THIS is not the surprise. THe surprise is that
setserial /dev/ttySx uart none no longer makes serial give up the port.
