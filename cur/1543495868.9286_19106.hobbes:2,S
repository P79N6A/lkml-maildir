Well, then I don't see a problem.  
Well, maybe there's a problem with the "all of them with a box of stars"
suggestion.  80 characters of warning message is probably plenty.

Again, I don't see a problem.  On the other hand we have kernel revisions
in the 2.1.xx series with warnings in the FTP archives that say "don't run
this kernel or it will trash all your filesystems."  It makes sense (to
me at least) that from a consumer protection point of view, kernels at
the most risk of this kind of problem should be labeled as such prior to
release.
You of course remain free to alter or remove the warning as you see fit
(as all users are).  No armed men in dark suits will visit your home to
force you to compile the warning into every binary.

You seem to be establishing your qualifications as a kernel tester.
I do not intend to drive away people such as yourself.  I do intend to
drive away people who would run an unstable kernel release without a
backup, get all their precious data blown away, and then whine about
"how awful Linux is" and "why doesn't it say that it's unstable then?
I just downloaded the latest version and expected it to work" to SlashDot.

I think you are being too easily annoyed, possibly by the terminology
in the text of the warning message rather than the idea of the warning
message itself.  As I said the first time, if you know better, you can
just ignore the warning.   I don't know what the precise text of the
message should be.  I was sort of hoping someone else would.  ;-)
My experience with various MIS departments is that they like software
to be labeled.  They want Y2K statements and assurances that it works
with this or that hardware.  I don't see any reason why, if they knew
that there was a difference at all, they would not want Linux kernels to
be labeled stable vs. unstable.  The 'odd minor revision number' rule
isn't sufficient, because very few people outside of this mailing list
actually know that the rule exists, and the rule isn't generally followed
outside of the Linux kernel tree.
However, there are two problems with asserting that the kernel is a
production kernel:
1.  It's a lot harder to assert that software is useful for something
and does not have bugs, than it is to assert that it might not be useful
for anything and probably has bugs.  It's possible to get into serious
legal issues if one says something that can be disproved, or that would
impose an express or implied obligation.
2.  The absence of an assertion that something is untested and
possibly dangerous unfortunately for many unsophisticated users implies
that it _is_ tested and _not_ dangerous.
So for _unsophisticated_ users, I would prefer that an instability warning
be attached to the unstable code instead of a stability assertion attached
to stable code.  Let commercial Linux vendors do the latter if they are
prepared for the consequences.
