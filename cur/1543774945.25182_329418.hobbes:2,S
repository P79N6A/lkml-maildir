Subject: sysfs abuse in recent i2o changes

drivers/message/i2o/config-osm.c has a function sysfs_create_fops_file,
which creates a sysfs file with supplied file_operations.  This is
pretty much against the sysfs design which only wants simple attributes,
ascsii or for corner cases binary.
Also, if we're going to allow this code it should move to sysfs.  And
stop using lookup_hash directly (use lookup_one_len instead), it'll go
away soon.
