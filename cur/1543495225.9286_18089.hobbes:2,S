This easily doable on linux, too. Even on current scheduler (because
it has problems with accounting...):

PS: It would be nice to modify kernel to be _pessimistic_ about
idle. Right now it is so optimistic that you can run boy bad and see
0% cpu utilization when it is in fact 80%. It would be much better to
report worse values than to report better values.
