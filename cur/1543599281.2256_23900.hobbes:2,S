Is there any way to block use of an interface for outbound connections?
I have a host who's primary outbound interface is on a private network
(using a private address block for our backbone). Unfortunately, this
means that most applications (those not providing an option to select
bind address) will bind to this private-net address when establishing
outbound connections or sending udp packets.
The host has another address which is a publically accessible ip, but
it's not the default route interface.
Is there any way to hide this interface on the host for ALL outbound
connections without modifying all applications/app invocations? Or some
way of overriding the mechanism for selection of default interface.
