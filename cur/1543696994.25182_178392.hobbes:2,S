Would it be possible to print a "starting XXX" and
"XXX started" before and after every service ? And please
also try to disable automatic modprobe, or change it to
something which logs what is loaded. Eg:
   echo /root/mymodprobe >/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe
with mymodprobe basically looking like :
#!/bin/bash
{date;echo "starting $@"} >> /tmp/modprobe.log
sync
exec modprobe $@

You may try nmi_watchdog=2. I once was adviced to try =1,
but it never worked for me, while =2 worked as expected.
Don't ask me why, all I know is that there are a few other
people out there happily using it this way too.

Willy
