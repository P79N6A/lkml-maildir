I am not going to claim to thoroughly understand the power-management
code, but do have an additional question.
What happens if the processor became aware of a new grace period just
before entering pm_idle?  I could imagine this code simply refusing
to power down the processor if there was a pending grace period, but
I don't see any sign of this.  I could also imagine somehow deferring
interrupts until pm_idle exits.  I don't see anything that looks like
it does this, but don't claim to be any sort of power-management
expert.
						Thanx, Paul
