But isn't request_firmware_nowait a one time deal. It creates a kernel
thread which will call the cont function once and end it. In that case I
will have to unload and reload the driver every time before doing an
update.
Also driver's unload has to free the allocated memory; this will not
serve the purpose of this driver.

I must be missing some things here. Can copying the data to the sysfs
file with normal attributes work? Don't we need to have a sysfs file
with bin attribute? Could you please elaborate on this...I am quoting
you from one of your earlier response "I can understand having the data
use the sysfs binary attribute, but do not do this for the size files.
Please just use a normal attribute for them, the binary ones are _only_
for blobs of data that are not interpreted by the kernel"
Thanks,
Abhay
