You have to deal with the hash collisions somehow, for example with a
list of pages that have the same hash. And you have to calculate the
hash value. Both hurts performance.

On s390 we have to prepare for the situation of an address space that
has a chunk of memory at the low end and another chunk with bit 2^63
set. So the mem_map array needs to cover the whole 64 bit address range.
For sparsemem, we can choose on the size of the mem_map sections and on
how many indirections the lookup table should have. Some examples:
1) flat mem_map array: 2^52 entries, 56 bytes each.
2) mem_map sections with 256 entries / 14KB for each section,
   1 indirection level, 2^44 indirection pointers, 128TB overhead
3) mem_map sections with 256 entries / 14KB for each section,
   2 indirection levels, 2^22 indirection pointers for each level,
   32MB for each indirection array, minimum 64MB overhead
4) mem_map sections with 256 entries / 14KB for each section,
   3 indirection levels, 2^15/2^15/2^14 indirection pointers,
   256K/256K/128K indirection arrays, minimum 640K overhead
5) mem_map sections with 1024 entries / 56KB for each section,
   3 indirection levels, 2^14/2^14/2^14 indirection pointers,
   128K/128K/128K indirection arrays, minimum 384KB overhead
2 levels of indirection results in large overhead in regard to memory.
For 3 levels of indirection the memory overhead is ok, but each lookup
has to walk 3 indirections. This adds cpu cycles to access the mem_map
array.
The alternative of a flat mem_map array in vmalloc space is much more
attractive. The size of the array is 2^52*56 Byte. 1,3% of the virtual
address space. The access doesn't change, an array gets accessed. The
access gets automatically cached by the hardware.
Simple, straightforward, no additional overhead. Only the setup of the
kernel page tables for the mem_map vmalloc area needs some thought.
