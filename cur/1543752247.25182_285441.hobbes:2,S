Maybe for you it's end of problem, but I still can reproduce the weird
behaviour with 2.6.10-bk with the tests I posted before. I don't buy end
of problem proclamations, as long as I can proove the contrary.
The only working patch so far is Andrea's fix of the invocation, which
also solves the reentrancy problem, gets rid of the timer,counter hack
and my small contribution to the selection algorithm.
