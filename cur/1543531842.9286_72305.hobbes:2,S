The "memory management" functions are just to a standard way to
manage an heap.  "memory management" has a completely different
meaning than the kernel "memory management" subsystem.

malloc() is the same of calloc() on Linux.  The difference is there
because C is not a UNIX-only thing.  You can compile C programs under DOS.
Zeroing memory should be done explicitly. I don't believe it pays anything,
but that's another thread.
