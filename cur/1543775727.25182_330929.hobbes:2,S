yes, 
#define IDEFLOPPY_TICKS_DELAY  HZ/20
seems to be the solution.
when I've tested some values for IDEFLOPPY_TICKS_DELAY in December 2004,
I cannot found the best value for this. The Kernel version was 2.6.8
from the SuSE9.2 distribution.
I take a look in ide-cd.c and found there the function
cdrom_timer_expiry as
a possibility to handle timeout issues smoother. I tried this function
as 
idefloppy_timer_expiry in ide-floppy.c in combination with
IDEFLOPPY_TICKS_DELAY  60
as a best result for all cases. It seems to reach out to change
IDEFLOPPY_TICKS_DELAY
as suggested from you, idefloppy_timer_expiry is not really necessary.

This seems related to 2.4 -> 2.6 HZ change.

"ticks" delay should be expressed using HZ
#define IDEFLOPPY_TICKS_DELAY  HZ/20
for 50msec delay (N.B. the comment in the code about default delay
being 50msec also seems wrong - it was more like ~33msec in 2.4)
Could you please test if this fixes your problems?
