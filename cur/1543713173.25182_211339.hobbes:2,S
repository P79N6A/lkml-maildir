hello friends,
            I want to add my own routine to network
protocol stack. 
What i want to do i will explain you. For each and
every packet that outgoes from kernel i want to attach
a 8 byte of my own checksum to data part in packet.
This ensures that data is to be transmitted correctly
across computers.
Can anybody help me where i have to insert my code in
kernel source tree cause there are 3 programs to be
included in which one exchanges keys adjecent
computers. second calculates checksum on basis of that
key. and third checks packet replay. 
I wish to be personally CC'ed the answers/comments
posted to the list in response to my posting.
regards,
Parag.
