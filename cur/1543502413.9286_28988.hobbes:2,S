Hopeless.  The cost of inter-CPU communication is way too high to try
to share such fine-grained tasks.

Keeps coming back every once in a while.  Has already been tried in a few
cases, and it has some definite advantages in a few cases.  But it also has
some nasty difficulties.  Sadly every experiment I know of ended up stopping
as soon as some code worked and showed little improvement.

Slow.  Only worth it if the message is big enough (last time I heard, the
cut-over point was around 8KB).
> Runaway process detection
Excellent way to bloat the kernel with code that catches about 1% of the
problematic cases, which happen to be the least annoying cases (your runaway
processes will simply eat up some of your CPU time, but will have a very low
priority, so it doesn't slow down the machine too much, is trivial to kill,
...).
