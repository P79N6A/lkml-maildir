For me it is ok.
It was subscriber-only because this was a very low traffic
mailing list (but with daily spam).  BTW, IIRC spam problem
began only when we moved to sf.net.
Anyway, from the beginning there was problem with moderation.
I think because this list is to much low-traffic, to high
spam/true message ratio and no more active moderators)
Considering the nearly inexistent spam in vger, I think it
is a good move.
