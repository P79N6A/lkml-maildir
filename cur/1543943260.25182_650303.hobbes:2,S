I have trouble locating some of the git urls (the mm repository, for
example). I have browsed around
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/,
consulted the kernel FAQ, and read the obvious links on www.kernel.org.
git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.x.y.git is easy
to find, and I would guess that the main development repository is
pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git/
but that is speculation.
Can someone who knows take a minute or two to put a note of the main
urls on www.kernel.org or the FAQ, or have I just missed something?
