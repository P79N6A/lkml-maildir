It looks like the VBE hardware state buffer for your video card is
larger than the 4k currently supported by connector.  The problem should
be easily fixed by setting CONNECTOR_MAX_MSG_SIZE in include/linux/connector.h
to e.g. 16k.  I've already updated the patch on my website, so next time
you download it, the error messages should be gone.
Best regards,
Michal
