It's not primarily a performance issue it's more of a correctness
issue. You *need* to be able to distinguish the masks between
consistent and dynamic allocations.

Sure you can add the mask to the allocation calls, but thats going to
cost you since you are not going to be able to make it inline. The
consistent allocations have to be programmed into the IOMMU at mapping
time. Having the consistent DMA mask as we do right now is a lot
cleaner and it means the driver doesn't have to do a ton of runtime
accounting.

Bzzzt, *wrong*! Take a look at drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm_pci.c,
if you look at the code you will notice that the hardware does support
different masks for consistent vs dynamic allocations (32 bit for
consistent vs 39 or 64 bit for dynamic). However make a note that the
driver uses the current interface incorrectly and thinks that
pci_set_dma_mask() actually applies to pci_alloc_consistent, which is
something it never did.

But it will, as people have been telling you repeatedly, there *is* a
need for this stuff, it's just that not all the patches have been
fully integrated yet. I pushed for this change in 2.5.x so we didn't
have to make infrastructure changes to support this in the middle of
2.6.x.

Well you are trying to remove something people need and which was put
in there after considerable discussion between the involved
parties. The reasonsing was even documented in
Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt.
