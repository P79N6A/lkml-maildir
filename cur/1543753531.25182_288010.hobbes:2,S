That's true, this is more for battery operated systems. In the
current patch there's not that much extra calculation going on when
the system is busy, but there is some overhead.

OK, that makes sense.

Sounds like for some reason it does not work on your computer then.
I've tried it only on four different machines here, with one SMP
box, and it works fine here. And the debug printk works too, and
time is accurate.
If you have a chance, can you please provide me with some more info
on your system, see my recent reply to Pavel in this thread for the
tests I've been using. Sounds like your system won't boot well enough
to carry out the tests though...

Great, I'd like to try it out here.

Sure there's a lot of room for improvment, but it works quite
accurately here.
