   i am having trouble to get a ipv6 over ipv4 tunnel to work
   on a linux/sparc with a vanilla 2.4.18 kernel - It seems
   there is something broken. The same setup works on i386. 
Unfortunately SIT tunnels use SIOCDEVPRIVATE ioctls which we can't
support in 32-bit programs runnign on sparc64 hardware.  Sorry.
Some day we'll add non-conflicting ioctls for SIT and other similar
devices using SIOCDEVPRIVATE but for now you're out of luck.
