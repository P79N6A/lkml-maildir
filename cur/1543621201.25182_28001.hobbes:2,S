Personally khttpd should be ripped from the kernel.  It is a nice, uh,
example.  Or something.
TUX touches enough code that it isn't a clear decision to merge,
although it is certainly worth it.  I, however, think we are rapidly
approaching the point, if not there already, that with a zero-copy
network driver userspace can perform as good as TUX with none of the
downsides.  That was part of Ingo's goal and a lot of the benefits -
sendfile etc - are a result of TUX.
Anyhow, if I recall correctly, X15 performed better than TUX.
