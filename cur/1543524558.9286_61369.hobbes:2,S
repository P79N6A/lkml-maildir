I'm surprised ppp behaves this way. I modeled the kernel/user-part
structure of CIPE after PPP some years ago and it goes this way: when
ciped exits, the device is closed, _and_ when the device gets closed,
ciped is made to exit.
To me, it makes perfect sense to "ifconfig xxx down" to down a device,
no matter what kind of device that is.
