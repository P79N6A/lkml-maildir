Hi all
I have problems with this new kernel, I compiled the 2.6.0-test2 but when
start the services this kernel hang in the service starting RedHat Network,
the message are:

INIT:Id"2" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
INIT:Id"3" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
INIT:Id"4" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes

I have in my grub.conf the oher kernel version 2.4.20, If I start with this
kernel, all work fine.
How can I to resolv this problem with new kernel?
