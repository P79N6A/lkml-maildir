Hello!
Quoting r. Roland Dreier (roland@topspin.com) "[openib-general] [PATCH][5/18] InfiniBand/mthca: add needed rmb() in event queue poll":
> Add an rmb() between checking the ownership bit of an event queue
> entry and reading the contents of the EQE.  Without this barrier, the
> CPU could read stale contents of the EQE before HW writes the EQE but
> have the read of the ownership bit reordered until after HW finishes
> writing, which leads to the driver processing an incorrect event. This
> was actually observed to happen when multiple completion queues are in
> heavy use on an IBM JS20 PowerPC 970 system.
> 
> Also explain the existing rmb() in completion queue poll (there for
> the same reason) and slightly improve debugging output.

Since we are using the eqe here, it seems that read_barrier_depends
shall be sufficient (as well as in the cq case)?
However, I see that read_barrier_depends is a nop on ppc, and the
comment indicates that problems were seen on ppc 970.
What gives? do I misunderstand what a dependency is?
