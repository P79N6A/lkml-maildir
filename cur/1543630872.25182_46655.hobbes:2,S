Hmmh, that's always worked for me. Actually I always apply patches by hand
(not with bk import), and as my "patch" knows about SCCS, it automatically
checks out files as needed. After that they are in "bk edit"  status, so
another bk edit just won't do anything.
So for me, it plays just well together.
