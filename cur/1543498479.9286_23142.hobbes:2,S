No, that defeats the searching scheme. What you want is:
- no driver: no directory
- driver loaded: directory with one entry per piece of hardware
- opendir ("/dev/ide/cd"): load driver.
Putting in symlinks like in your scheme requires a symlink for every
possible entry that might ever exist if you installed an array of
CD-ROMs. That gets us back to pre-devfs days.

Have you actually looked at the patch or at least the documentation?
The location-based naming scheme you want is implemented in devfs. And
the old names are still there. And there are boot option to give you
choice.
It's all done. A year ago.
