sorry for the delay, your mail got marked as spam.  In the future
please copy networking issues to netdev@vger.kernel.org, and be sure
to copy the maintainers of the driver you're having problems with
(they are in the MAINTAINERS file)

are you sure that patch did that?  What version of e100 are you using?
we've since enabled MDI-X on most parts with this patch:
http://git.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=60ffa478759f39a2eb3be1ed179bc3764804b2c8;hp=09e590e5d5a93f2eaa748a89c623258e6bad1648
Please try the latest kernel or the latest e100 available from e1000.sf.net
if that doesn't work we'll need to know what kernel are you using?

you're getting confused between decimal and hex.  82551 is rev 16 (0x10)

the only relevant way to tell e100 parts apart is the revision id
