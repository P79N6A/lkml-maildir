No, I've finally isolated the problem.  My SYSRQ key generates
the make and break codes one after the other without waiting for
the release.  In other words, when I press SYSRQ, it sends:
0x54 0xd4
It does NOT wait for me to release the key, therefore there is no
way I can press another key in the middle.  The kernel sees a
press of SYSRQ as a press and release, even if it is held down,
therefore SYSRQ is not possible.

Yes, I am going to have to modify the code which activates SYSRQ.
It cannot just be a simple key replacement however because SYSRQ
key is the only key with a unique code when ALT is held down...
So, I need some obscure impossible to do accidentally combo like
you described above.  I just need to determine how to do it in
the kernel source without screwing my kernel up.  ;o)
Thanks for your help!
