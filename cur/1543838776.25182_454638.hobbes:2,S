That's not quite true, if you set nr_requests to 128 that's 128 for
reads and 128 for writes. With the batching you will actually typically
see 128 * 3 / 2 == 192 requests allocated. Which translates to about
96MiB of dirty data on the queue, if everything works smoothly. The 3/2
limit is quite new, before I introduced that, if you had a lot of writes
each of them would be allowed 16 requests over the limit. So you would
sometimes see huge queues, as with just eg 16 writes, you could have 128
+ 16*16 requests allocated.
I've always been of the opinion that the vm should handle all of this,
and things should not change or break if I set 10000 as the request
limit. A rate-of-dirtying throttling per process sounds like a really
good idea, we badly need to prevent the occasional write (like a process
doing sync reads, and getting stuck in slooow reclaim) from being
throttled in the presence of a heavy dirtier.
