The change looks rather suspicious to me.
Bank 0 is the data cache unit (DC)
Do you have an errata that says that the DC bank is bad on all Athlons?
Normally BIOS or microcode are supposed to turn off bad MCEs by 
masking them in another register. Maybe the person's CPU has a 
real problem that is just masked now, e.g. it could be overclocked
and stress the cache too much.
The original MCE was:
Status: (4) Machine Check in progress.
