Yes, normally it is.

Yes.  sync_blocks will be 1024 (a nice big number) and the loop will
exit quite quickly having done nothing (which is what it needs to do
in that case).
Ofcourse, if someone submits a bio for multiple thousands of sectors
it will loop needlessly a few times, but do we ever generate bios that
are even close to a megabyte?
If so, that 1024 can be safely increased to 1<<20, and possibly higher
but I would need to check.
Thanks for asking
