the tainted flags have a flag for "there was a previous oops", and if that's set,
the kerneloops.org website ignores the report. Simple as that.

again as of 2.6.24-rc4 or so, this is just no longer the case. The problem is with
older kernels which had a WARN_ON() that didn't print ANY information other than
a plain backtrace.
