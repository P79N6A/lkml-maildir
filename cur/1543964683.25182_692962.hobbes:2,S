That's a part of the 'simple' client protocol already, there are
transactions, which are only committed completed, when server replies
that they are, there is also failover reconnection and timeout detection
features as long as switching to different servers in case of failure.
Yes, it is a bit more than 'simple' protocol, but I think that's what it
has to have, and hopefuly not more :)

Yeah, it is far from 'small' problem :)
Really simple protocol was in the first version, and it was also fast,
but yes, it was rather miserable from failure point of view.
