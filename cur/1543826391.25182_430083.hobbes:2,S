ok - that's what the two changes i did do.

could you send a patch for that? When there is single-depth nesting of 
two atom-locks then the annotation is easy, instead of:
	spin_lock(&atom->alock);
you should do:
	spin_lock_nested(&atom->alock, SINGLE_DEPTH_NESTING)
for the unordered unlocks, just change the one that is non-nested to 
spin_unlock_non_nested(). (the second lock can stay spin_unlock() - that 
will be in order again)
