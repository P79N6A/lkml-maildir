Actually there's physical DRAM offset: PHY_OFFSET, defined on ARM only. 
max_low_pfn happens to be the same as `num_lowpages'.
These assignments seems illogical in naming. But just happen to let this 
patch work.  Other platforms may still break.
[coywolf@everest ~/linux-2.6.7/arch]$ grep max_low_pfn arm* -rn
arm/mm/init.c:235:      max_low_pfn = memend_pfn - O_PFN_DOWN(PHYS_OFFSET);
arm26/mm/init.c:187:    max_low_pfn = memend_pfn - PFN_DOWN(PHYS_OFFSET);
arm26/mm/mm-memc.c:157: page_nr = max_low_pfn;
