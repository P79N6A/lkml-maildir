Yes, all resources must be freed or the device will not work if it is
attached to the driver a second time.  This is becuase the driver will
think the device is busy when actually the resources were just never
freed from the previous session.  Also the resources must be freed to
safetly disable the device.

This is determined by both the pnp layer and the driver model.  Becuase a
card is a group of devices the individual devices must also not be matched
to more than one driver.  PnP Card Services have a few bugs in this area,
all of which have been resolved in the patch I released last week.  Greg,
could you please forward that to Linus.

Currently the pnp layer does not support legacy non PnP devices.  I plan
to add support for them soon.  This support should achieve two objectives.
1.) Reserve resources used by the legacy devices
	a.) if the resources match an existing pnp devices, bind to that
	    device
	b.) if they conflict but do not match exactly return an error
	c.) otherwise reserve the resources and prevent pnp devices from
	    using them.
2.) Represent these legacy devices in sysfs.  Maybe the current legacy dir
    could be used or I may have to create "pnp_legacy".  Needs more research.
Regards,
Adam
