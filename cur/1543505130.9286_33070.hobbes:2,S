The kernel doesn't know how to parallelize one program.  The program
has to do that for itself.

When the scheduler decides where to run a task, it prefers the CPU it
previously ran on.  However, if there is another task already scheduled
on that CPU and another is idle, it will be run there.
I assume you are testing under X and some stat display program.  Then
you have 3 programs running: your program, X and the stat program. 
Because X has to update the screen after the stat program updates its
display, all three may be running at the same time causing your program
to bounce around.
