Lots of people work on the kernel. If you wish to keep reiser4
maintenance to yourself, you probably need to keep it as a separate
patch. Please consider submitting the non-controversial bits for
merging first and then continue with the rest. It does not make a lot
of sense reviewing the current patchkit as many parts of it won't be
merged as is (e.g. the plugin stuff).
