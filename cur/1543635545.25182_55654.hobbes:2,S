Ehmm. We have had "old IDE support" in the kernel for "ages".  We have
two aic7xxx driver, two rtl8139 drivers, two, or more ncr53c8xx drivers. 
So why in the case of IDE has the "new IDE" driver not been forked and
implemented under a new "name" such that those working on other stuff
can chose to use the "old reliable" driver while others daring to test
the new advanced rewrite can do so?
