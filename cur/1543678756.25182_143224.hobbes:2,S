I can't seem to reproduce this with any sort of regularity.  The only
data points I have are
- It doesn't occur when the adjtimex reversion is backed out
- It seems to occur shortly after the machine is rebooted with the clock
set to the future.
- it reproduces much more readily if ntpd is running
I've stuck some debugging code in there and find that the ->base for the
timer is NULL and the timer function is igmp_ifc_timer_expire.
I'll continue looking at this.
