Well, a little bit more information about what he is doing would be 
helpful.  I'd
like to better understand the environment and what the traffic from the 
client
looks like.
Write gathering is not a panacea for all of the ills caused by the NFSv2 
WRITE
stable storage requirements.  In fact, if done wrong, it can cause 
performance
regressions, such as those being noticed by Steve.

I implemented the write gathering used in Solaris and experimented with
several (many?) different approachs.  Adding a delay in order to allow
subsequent WRITE requests to arrive seems like a good thing, but can
end up just adding latency to the entire process if not done right.
A suggestion might be to use the delay caused by the nfsd_sync() call
and synchronize other WRITE requests around that.  The delay caused by
doing real i/o to the storage subsystem should allow write gathering to
take place, assuming that the client is generating concurrent WRITE
requests.
