I havent been able to find a way of installing
Linux slackware or red hat with out using 90 or more
floppies, and i have no cd rom on my 386. Is there
a way to install Linux over a network on such an old machine.
It currently has windows 3.1 and DOS running. And 
has one 60 mb hard drive and one 120 mb hard drive.
I have found a small easy to install minix 386 that goes over
DOS so I may just use that to start off, in order to install
a very old linux kernel .01 or .02
