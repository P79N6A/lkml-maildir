I've lost some of mails about siimage on LKML, but Im' getting more and more 
confused about 'hangs' probably caused by siimage driver. I was using 15 
rqsize, now 128 - doesn't matter. It happens in random moments - sometimes at 
boot time when drive is fscked, sometimes when I'm trying to copy large 
amount of data and sometimes without any particular reason after several 
hours. I've updated MB (a7n8x deluxe rev 2.0) BIOS but controller (which is 
on-board) bios seems to be untouched (4.1.25 or so ). Is there any controller 
BIOS update which I could miss? what can be other reason?
