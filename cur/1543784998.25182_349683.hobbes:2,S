IIRC, someone was working on a VGA arbiter and some PCI-access kernel  
code
upon which X.org could be rebuilt.  Then all the messy /dev/mem issues
relating to PCI bus smashing go away (including the need for iopl, root
privts, etc), and a properly configured system could run X.org as a  
normal
user on any attached devices that user has permission to, including  
video
cards, displays, keyboards, mice, graphics tablets, joysticks, etc.
Unfortunately the project is not exactly small, so it wasn't moving very
quickly last I remember...
Cheers,
