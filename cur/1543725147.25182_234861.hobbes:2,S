Ask Vojtech Pavlik.

One already exists.  The short answer is that when .config doesn't
exist, we look at /boot/config-`uname -r` and then
arch/$(ARCH)/defconfig.  I believe the that 'make help' mentions the
next neat trick.  If you do 'make pmac_defconfig' for example,
arch/ppc/configs/pmac_defconfig is used as the base of a new .config
file, with all options not documented in that file being set to 'n'.
You can then either build the kernel, or further tweak via
menuconfig/etc.
