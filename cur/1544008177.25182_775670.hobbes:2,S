Hrmm, yeah, perhaps the use of scsi_req_map_sg() (which obviously still
has struct bio behind it) is causing the breakage..  I will wait for
Tomo, Boaz and co to have a look at the original patch to
lio-core-2.6.git/drivers/lio-core/target_core_pscsi.c and see if I am
missing something obvious.
Also, with the previous patch to drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c(), I am able to
move a few GB of bulk I/O and not hit the BUG_ON in
blk/blk-timeout.c:177 in blk_add_timeout() mentioned above when feeding
struct request into struct scsi_device->request_queue with
blk_execute_rq_nowait() with use_sg > 0 CDBs.  However, I am still
running into another reproducable BUG_ON in
block/cfq-iosched.c:cfq_find_next_rq() after extended bulk I/O tests.
Many thanks for your comments,
