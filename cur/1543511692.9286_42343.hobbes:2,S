I find it odd to hear this strangely anglo-centric view from someone for whom
(I presume) English is not their mother language. 20% of the world's
population can read English. This may exceed the figure for any other
language (about the same number can speak English and Mandarin, but less
Mandarin speakers can read), but still much of the human race would like to
manage low end products in a language other than English.
Promote multi-lingual everyone!
