Subject: [PATCH] sys_semop() EIDRM BUG fix

sys_semop() is wrong to insist that queue.status be -EIDRM when
sem_lock() fails on awakening.  It is quite normal for update_queue()
to have set status 0, removed process from queue and woken it; but
IPC_RMID come in before that process gets to run (or to lock) -
since process already off queue, its status is not set to -EIDRM.
If we want a safety check here, check removed from queue instead.
Return original status or -EIDRM? Checked other OSes, use -EIDRM.
