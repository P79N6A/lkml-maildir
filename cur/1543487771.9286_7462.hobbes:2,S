Just for the record. Jerry Epplin provided a fine semaphore package that has
shipped with RTLinux for over a year.

Me too.

The technical problem here is that the thread may want to use libc functions
that are incompatible with the RT side. For example, I can't see any way
for a RT thread to  safely "malloc". What I think would be good would be
a "run_as_rt_thread( f,period)" call that would send a piece of code into
the RT world with some safeguards at link time to make sure "f" was ok.

Richard. Can you try the following test:
Run 1 program that does setcheduler and does this loop
        do 1 million times
               rdtsc
               usleep(50000);
               rtdsc and compute difference
               compute average and worst case
       done
       print result
Then run program 2 while 1 is running
         while(1) write(1,buffer,10000000);
Start netscape, run a tar cvf /dev/null /home or something

What does the sched patch do?

I think that this is both possible and useful. I'd like to move RT out
of Linux proper where possible.
