   It is slow. But when someone compile something on our Linux cross 
compilation server - everyone else is out - "jerky" is not suffieciently 
hard word to describe how it works under load. (I hope 2.6 fixes this.)
   Sun Ultra 10 (Solaris 8) is magnitude slower, but when someone 
compiles something big - people still _*can*_ work on it. "find | xargs 
grep" is still ok. I notice usually background compilations by fact that 
:w takes visibly longer. But I can work.
   That's what matters. Try to work in vim if it is permanently get 
swaped out. _*Very*_ _*very*_ not nice.
   And there is no memory pressure - kernel just decided to enlarge I/O 
cache... 100% stupid.
   I personally prefer to have statical I/O cache - never saw it working 
reliably with dynamic allocation.
