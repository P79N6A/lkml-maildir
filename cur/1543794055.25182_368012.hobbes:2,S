It fails correctly when MSI quirk is enabled. I had the same problems
on AMD 8131 based machine with 2.6.11 kernel. E1000 was enabling MSI and
not getting any interrupts. Later (.13 I think) MSI quirk was introduced for
8131 chipset and everything started working (without having to hack E1000
that is).
May be you should just add your platform to the PCI quirks list ?
