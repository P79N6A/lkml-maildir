Unfortunately, we showed him he was wrong and the deadlock
could still happen with normal timeslicing processes and
RT tasks...
SCHED_IDLE adds nothing new and has just as little chance
of hanging the computer as normal system things. Because of
this, my patch adds a sysctl variable that the sysadmin has
to switch before normal users are allowed the use of SCHED_IDLE.
This allows the more careful sysadmins to use SCHED_IDLE for,
for instance, rc5des while not impacting normal system behaviour
or stability.
