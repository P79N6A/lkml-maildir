Here we go, a TBird 1.1G with KT133 (non-A), normally working with value
89 in reg 55, not exhibiting the bug under any setting.
with 89 (working, default):

So there is no noticeable difference. The values for 'even_faster' vary
between 10000 and 13000 between different runs with either setting of
register 55.
