Ever since I upgraded to phoenix bios ver. 14 and downgraded back to 7
yesterday, my modem began emitting this horrible noise, much like radio 
static, from the moment I log-in to the time I disconnect. The modem behaves 
normally under windows98 and nt. Ideas, anyone? I'm running kernel 
2.2.5-ac3. The problem also exhibits itself
under 2.2.12.
