Silly question: why do you :
printf("PMQ:-4: %p\n", *(pMsgBuf-4));
instead of:
                !!!
printf("PMQ:-4: %d\n", *(pMsgBuf-4));, or whatever applies...(typeof pMsgBuf?)
If you use %p, printf expects a pointer in stack, and depending on type of
pMsgBuf (is a char * ?), *pMsgBuf can be passed as a char (I don't think so,
C passes chars as ints, and I dont remenber any kind of option to modify this)
or a short or an int...
So, perhaps you dont put enough data on stack for a pointer and printf gets
incorrect data (the zero in pMsgBuf plus the return value that stored in rc...).
