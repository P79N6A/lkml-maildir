Go for it.  If you build it, they will come...
I'll reserve judgement until it is up and running, not just code available.
There has been lots of talk about patchbots, but I haven't seen anyone
crowing about their general-use patchbot on lkml.
I seriously doubt your system will work with GNU patches, though, as
they still go privately to Linus.  A big advantage of this patchbot
would be to expose GNU-style patches that would otherwise be "hidden" in
various BK repostories until Linus does a pull and a pre-patch.
(encouraging people to CC all patches to the patchbot would be a good
step, though, IMO)
