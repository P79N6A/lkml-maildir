I agree that this is a bug, but the fix is in the wrong spot.  The
dev_watchdog function already runs in softirq context so it doesn't
need to disable BH.
You can almost be guaranteed that if netpoll is involved in a bug
then it should be fixed :)
In this case, it's taking the tx lock in process context which is
not allowed.  So it should disable BH before taking the tx lock.
Thanks,
