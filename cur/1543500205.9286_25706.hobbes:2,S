Each testing branch dies with each beta release, each beta branch dies with
each stable release. As such the 3rd (alpha) is kinda shortlived. It's only
alive for however long it takes to release a beta and then a new branch is
started.
If the last pre release of a beta continued directly to the first pre
release of the next beta this wouldn't be so but AFAIK it makes a hop
directly to beta and then back to alpha again, thereby killing and
restarting the branch.
Oh. And that's 3 branches and not half a dozen. ;)
Hope that made sense. :)
