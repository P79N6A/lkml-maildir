It can happen if you sleep with a lock held.
It can not happen at random points in the code.
Thus there is a relation to preemption in kernel mode.
To cure that problem tasks holding a lock would have to be given
the highest priority of all tasks blocking on that lock. The semaphore
code would get much more complex, even in the succesful code path,
which would hurt a lot.
If on the other hand sleeping in kernel mode is explicit, you can simply
give any task being woken up a timeslice and the scheduling requirements
are met. If that should be a problem.
