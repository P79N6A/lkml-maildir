	Yes ,  After formatting it on an RLL based controller .
	Also 'some' of the RLL controllers would recognise a st506
	mfm formatted drive & use it .
	To the best of my knowledge there never was an Segate labeled
	st-506 that was RLL encoded .

	Yeah I can understand that one .  Did you use the rll controller
	to transfer the data ? or ?

	YES !!! ,  Of course I was quite happily suprised at the speed
	differance found going from DEC RL02's to those st506's ;-) .
