So basically you are just traversing your data depedency graph
wrongly. Do a level order traversion if it is a dependency forest
or an breadth first traversion if not.
If this node require IO -> schedule the IO and return back to the upper
level noticing it, that you like to be woken, if the IO is
finished.
If this node require Computation -> do it, if this CPU is the one with
lowest load, else schedule it for the CPU with lowest load.
Continue with next node.
(load is meant "number of compuations with same metric scheduled
on this thread")
Use only one thread per CPU. Try to make the IO-Waiting as unique
as possible (poll would be perfect).
So this is all doable, once you analyze your data dependency
graph properly and make the simulation data driven (which it
usally is).
