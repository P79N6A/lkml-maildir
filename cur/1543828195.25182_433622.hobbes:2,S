I think a proportional-share scheduler (which is what a CPU controller
may provide) has non-container uses also. Do you think nice (or sched policy) 
is enough to, say, provide guaranteed CPU usage for applications or limit 
their CPU usage? Moreover it is more flexible if guarantee/limit can be 
specified for a group of tasks, rather than individual tasks even in
non-container scenarios (like limiting CPU usage of all web-server 
tasks togther or for limiting CPU usage of make -j command).
