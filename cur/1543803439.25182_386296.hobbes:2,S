Hi Olaf,

[PATCH]
accessfs_readdir_aux() in fs/accessfs/inode.c 
should set DT_REG, since accessfs supports just directories
and regular files. The directory is already handled before
in the sole caller of accessfs_readdir_aux().
This saves the superflous stat(2) call after readdir(2).
All in all I like the concept! It makes the life of admins
much easier.
