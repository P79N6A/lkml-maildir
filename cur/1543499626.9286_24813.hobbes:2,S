   On the other hand, we will still need to solve locking of various device
lists (e.g., PCI device list) during driver initialization/cleanup. Some
"big lock" is IMHO an appropriate solution since access to these data
structures is not time critical at all, so we should choose the simplest
solution available.
   I'm not advocating for using the global kernel lock for this, but
a global configuration access lock should exist.
				Have a nice fortnight
