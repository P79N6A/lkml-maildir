Do you mean you'd maintain a low-level block-level null f/s?
I'll be more than happy to maintain the stackable one + docs myself
indefinitely.  But, I already have one, and I maintain it... :-) In fact,
Ion and I are maintaining it, so there's two people.  So the more people
there are maintaining it, the better.  We have to keep the templates current
b/c we have about a dozen active developers using wrapfs for their own stuff
(some even commercial products).
As for docs, it should be a joint effort.  The vfs.txt file is a good start,
but it quickly gets out of sync w/ vfs changes.  My wrapfs templates aren't
long, but they are complex: they behave like both VFS and a lower-level file
system.  They have to, in order to achieve transparency in stacking and
multi-level stacking.  Ion and I have pushed the limits of the VFS quite a
bit and managed to get stacking done w/ very little VFS changes (most of
which have long been incorporated).
In particular, the whole issue of when/how objects are created/destroyed
based on their refcount is messy.  What we really need to clean our code up
is a file system method that is called each time the refcnt of a
file/inode/dentry/whatever is incremented or decremented.
And let's not even talk about fan-out file systems and what demands they put
on the VFS.  But, I digress.  It'll be great to have one or more people
formally maintaining such code.
