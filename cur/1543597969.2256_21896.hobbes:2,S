i'm new to in developing kernel software under linux and what to 
know if i'm write when i create kernel_threads like this:
variant I
---------
1) call kernel_thread 
2) in the thread function 
    a) get the big kernel lock
    b) call daemonize
    c) release big kernel lock
variant II
----------
schedule the call to kernel_thread using tq_schedule
- is there no need to call daemonize in the second variant - if yes why?
- can i do both variants during interupt time (when there is no valid 
current)?
