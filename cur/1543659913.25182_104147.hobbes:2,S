Could you elaborate on the purpose of this a bit?  for_each_cpu() is only used 
by the voyager subarch on x86 to traverse sparse CPU bitmaps efficiently in 
critical path code.  It has no other use in x86 SMP because all other 
subarch's tend to compact the CPU bitmap much more.
If there are other uses for the construct, it should probably be put in bitops 
and become for_each_bit(i, mask)
