Oh, you're brain-dead shut the hell up...
Macintosh resource forks are somethat you you either "get" or don't "get".
Coming from a Macintosh background and working with Macintosh OS internals,
I can't imagine that OSes live without and additional stream per file.
The BeOS does some pretty outstanding stuff with file attributes and
like. OpenStep hack this stuff in using directories, but it still was
pretty effective since I was designed correctly.

Half brain-dead Macintosh folks have been dealing with this crap without
problems since 1984.
Are you telling me that you, being a Unix/Linux, person can't handle
FTPing a multistream file with all those user-unfriendly tar options ?
That's complete bullshit and being a down right technical pussy..

That's probably because you don't do any serious GUI programming
and find crap like Xt and Xlib acceptable. Gnome is good though, same for Qt.

Watch how "find" chokes on Linux/Unix/Win32 systems and then do the
same search on crappy MacOS machine that's got a 32 bit DOS extender for
a VM subsystem and blow the all the Linux/Unix/Win32 away from having all
those dorky "dot" ("." <---) pathetically slow down the search.
You can just search the data fork for content.

Well, I guess you like double clicking on a MP3 file with a ".au" suffix
and watch the spawned program choke on a bunch of discrete cosine data,
right ?
File suffix MIME determination is just about the most brain-dead/annoying
thing. Replace them with per file attributes for MIME determination, etc...

I take it you never made the transition away from the DOS prompt over to
a Macintosh, right ?

This is freaking irritating post.
