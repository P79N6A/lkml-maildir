Minimum for an x86 kernel is about 2Mb and 386 CPU. The 8086 subset
kernel isn't really "Linux", its more an escaped insanity. For non x86
you need a bottom end mmuless 32bit processor and a couple of Mb.
There are folks driving the size down (the -tiny patches) because
2Mb for the entire system is still too large for some users.
