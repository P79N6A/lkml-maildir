Here's another round of patches for the HP cciss driver in the attached tarball. These patches are intended for inclusion in the 2.4.22 kernel. This tarball contains 3 patches that should be applied in this order:
	1. cciss_2447_author_change.patch
	2. cciss_2447_shirq_fix2.patch
	3. cciss_2447_lock_fix.patch
The first patch is a requirement from our legal types & management, the other 2 are bug fixes.
Full comments & desciptions are in the patch files.
There will be more patches in the next few days. They will include:
	1. Failover support for multipath environments.
	2. devfs support.
	3. Support for more than 8 controllers.
Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
mikem
