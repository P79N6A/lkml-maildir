You won't notice on ext34, but xfs, btrfs and probably jfs should go
slower with this.  The throttle should wait for one of the entries on
the queue to finish, and then put this inode on the  queue in order.
Doing the current one synchronously will generate random IO.
On XFS, create 256,000 4k files, drop caches and then time find . |

This could be good and bad.
