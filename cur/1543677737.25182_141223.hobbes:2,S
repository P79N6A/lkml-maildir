Question related to this item specifically :)
Do you want to individually send 4000 - 16000 (or more) TX stop / start 
events per second to userspace?  :)  At some point Heisenburg defeats 
low latency :)
If not (and I hope not), perhaps also look into the net stack statistics 
already kept (or add more sampling stats if necessary), and instead 
trigger events based on sampling those statistics.
