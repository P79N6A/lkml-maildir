Yes, with address translation hardware such as IOMMU, the zone is
meaningless. The IOMMU drivers ignore the zone flag
(e.g. intel_alloc_coherent).
But the GFP_DMA in IA64's platform_dma_alloc_coherent() is still
necessary for swiotlb with devices that don't have DMA_64BIT_MASK
coherent_dma_mask. They need a < 4G address.
This is exactly what x86 and x86_64 do, dma_alloc_coherent in
arch/x86/include/asm/dma-mapping.h. It sets GFP_DMA and GFP_DMA32 for
swiotlb and pci-nommu.c when necessary.
