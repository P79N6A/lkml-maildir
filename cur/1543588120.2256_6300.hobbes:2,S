Ehh... Non-lazy variant is just read() and write() as down_failed() and
up_wakeup() Lazy... How about
	if (Lock <= 1)
		goto must_open;
opened:
	/* as in non-lazy case */
must_open:
	pipe(fd);
	lock decl Lock
	jg lost_it	/* Already seriously positive - clean up and go */
	jl spin_and_lose
	/* Lock went from 1 to 0 - go ahead */
	reader = fd[0];
	writer = fd[1];
	Lock = MAX_INT;
	goto opened;
spin_and_lose:
	/* Won't take long - another guy got to do 3 memory writes */
	while (Lock <= 0)
		;
lost_it:
	lock incl Lock
	close(fd[0]);
	close(fd[1]);
	goto opened;
