Peter,
This indicates that the method being used by the 
new aic7xxx driver for initialization is broken 
with respect to other scsi adapters.
The intent is that all built in HBA drivers are
initialized _before_ the built in upper level 
drivers (e.g. sd). To get the effect you describe
the driver init order seems to have been:
  register ncr53c8xxx
  register sd
  register aic7xxx      # too late ...
