While exploiting a stacks buffer overflow you can do at least two things:
* Changing the execution flow by overwriting return address or saved EBP.
* Injecting new executable code in the stack.
"Standard" stack smashing is doing both. The purpose of stack 
randomization is to make it harder to jump to code injected into the 
stack. If enough bits are randomized it's unlikely that an exploit will 
find the correct address at the first try. Now all you need is to make 
sure the vulnerable program won't be relaunched after a given number of 
crashes (or the chances that the exploit find the correct address will 
raise).
Of course you could inject code in other places or use existing code in 
address space (libc or running program) but this is at least a first 
layer of protection and adding layers is exactly what security is about.
