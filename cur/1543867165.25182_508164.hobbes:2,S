Numfiles is not the most interesting place in beancounters.
Kmemsize accounting is much more important actually.

I have already pointed out the fact that this place
will hurt performance too much. If we have some context
on task this context must
  1. be get-ed without any locking
  2. be settable to some temporary one without
     locking as well
Unfortunately current containers implementation doesn't
allow all of the above which blocks the rest implementation
of beancounters over them.
