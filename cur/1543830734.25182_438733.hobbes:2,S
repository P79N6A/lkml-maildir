The destructor is such a callback.

We will always reclaim a few object from each page. See the patch.
Single refcount=2 objects could also be detected and we could try to free 
them.

Since we free some dentries in each block they will be effectively be 
moved because they get reallocated in a current slab block.

The callback can make that determination and could trigger these events.
The callback notifies the higher layers that it would be advantageous to 
free this element. The higher layers can then analyze the situation and 
either free or give up.
