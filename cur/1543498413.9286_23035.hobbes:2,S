It is. ANSI X3.159-1989 defines this in 4.12.1 (page 171, line 15), and  
ISO C in whatever the renumbered sections turned out as.

K&R is right, but it's not the standard.

There's no such thing as a "conforming compiler". The whole standard  
doesn't talk about a compiler even once (at least in the normative parts).
There's just a "conforming implementation". Two kinds, in fact:  
"freestanding" or "hosted".
The library and include files are part of the implementation, just as the  
compiler is.
The above scenario *might* be a conformant freestanding implementation -  
that is, one with minimal library support (float.h, limits.h, stdarg.h,  
and stddef.h, only). It *cannot* be a conformant hosted implementation,  
because it doesn't conform to 4.12.1.
And of course, the standard doesn't ever talk about when a conforming  
implementation should complain about not being conformant. That would be  
nonsensical.
