I think IDE driver will never ask for DMA on PIO only drive
Bartlomiej, do you have comments on my patch? So far, I myself spotted
some minor problems:
I forgot to remove now-extraneous if() from ide.c:
static int set_xfer_rate (ide_drive_t *drive, int arg)
{
        int err = ide_wait_cmd(drive,
                        WIN_SETFEATURES, (u8) arg,
                        SETFEATURES_XFER, 0, NULL);
        if (!err && arg) {
                ide_set_xfer_rate(drive, (u8) arg);
                ide_driveid_update(drive);
        }
        return err;
}
And second, in ide_do_drive_cmd(), mdelay(2000)
after WIN_SETFEATURES is a bit rude.
