I installed net-tools-1.52.  All problems went away, except for the
error message
  SIOCADDRT
during boot.
(It's right after the place where I previously got th e net-pf-19
 messages, and right before some kind of time and date information.
 Sorry for not being able to be more specific---this error message
 doesn't seem to stick in any of the system log files.)
I guess I could just ignore it, but it's kind of worrying...
