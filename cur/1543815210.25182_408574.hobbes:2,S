This also implies that dirty bits of the pte for mlocked pages are never 
checked. 
Currently light swapping (which is very common) will scan over all pages 
and move the dirty bits from the pte into struct page. This may take 
awhile but at least at some point we will write out dirtied pages.
The result of not scanning mlocked pages will be that mmapped files will 
not be updated unless either the process terminates or msync() is called.
