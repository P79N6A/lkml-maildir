I found this in the FAQs (on Debian):
Q) I'm using RedHat and modules don't autoload any more.
A) RedHat turns module autoloading off if /proc/ksyms isn't found.
    Change line 337 of /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit from:
   if ! grep -iq nomodules /proc/cmdline 2>/dev/null && [ -f /proc/ksyms ]; then
    to
   if ! grep -iq nomodules /proc/cmdline 2>/dev/null && [ -f /proc/modules ]; then
Hope this helps.

Harri
