Subject: [2.2.1 bug?]  Lots of unkillable zombies stuck in 'exit' with 0 VM size

I have some unkillable runq zombies on my system, which some cron job is
running.  They are all instances of 'runq', which was run by cron, and
they all block in do_exit, and they have 0 virtual memory.

Is this a kernel bug?  I have a UP PPro running Debian 2.1 (glibc
"2.0.7.19981211-2").
