Sure. Before I go over them though, could you perhaps confirm that just 
doing a manual alloc/add _is_ this proper API? Ie, something like:
     device = platform_device_alloc(NAME, i);
     if (!device)
             return -ENOMEM;
     error = platform_device_add(device);
     if (error) {
             platform_device_put(device);
             return error;
     }
(there by the way are still a few users left outside ALSA as well)
Rene.
