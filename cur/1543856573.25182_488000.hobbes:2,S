Since you mention md, dm comes to mind. I have seen a couple of drives that
were previously attached to fake raid controllers becoming unavailable when
moved to a normal controller. I haven't found the one size workaround for
the problem yet. Can you check
/sys/block/sda/holders ?
Also /sys/bus/ide/whoevertheholderis/[bind|unbind] are 'curious' but I'm not
sure how one is supposed to use them.
