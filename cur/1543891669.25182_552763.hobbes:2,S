Yeah, I remember all that but I don't think it provides a suitable
description of what all this code is there for - what problem it is
solving and how it solves it.
If we just want some pseudo-private fd space for glibc to use then I'd have
thought that the existing code could be tweaked to do that: top-down
allocation, start at some high offset, etc.  But apparently there's more
to it than this.
