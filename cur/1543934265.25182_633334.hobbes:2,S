Right. And I was referring to the is above (I forgot it's a CRC32 and
not a SHA1). But my point is why not codify some "policy" here with
respect to module versioning, rather than have the latter exist to
workaround the case that module versions aren't bumped manually.
(I'm not arguing to remove srcversion, just asking whether that might be
a better approach in general - perhaps allow a module to print this
version string at init time also, rather than just be in modinfo?)
Jon.
