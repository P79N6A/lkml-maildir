Hello,
i have a strange problem with two of my machines:
They are identical P4 systems with Intel Chipset with two epro100 adapters
onboard and a d-link dfe-580TX quad ethernet card.
I am using Kernel 2.4.18 and sundance.o v1.07a 7/9/2002.
The problem is, that i only can use the two first ports of the d-link card.
I can set up all four with no problems according to mii-diag and alta-diag.
Each port recognises link up/down and negotiates to the right speed and
flowcontrol.
But when i send traffic over the ports 4&5, at first nothing happens and of
course i can't see any interrupts in /proc/interrupts eth4 eth5 and after a
while i get
the console message:
eth4: Transmit timed out, status c0, resetting...
Having a look at alta-diag i noticed, that the column
" Interrupt status is..." differs between Index#1 / #2 and Index#3 / #4
Index#1 and #2 tells: Interrupt status is 0000: No interrupts pending.
Index#3 and #4 tells: Interrupt status is 0101: Interrupt summary Link status
changed
and after genrating some traffic that line changes at Index#3 & #4 to:
Interrupt status is 0301: Interrupt summary Link status changed Tx DMA done.
The beehavier is identical on both machines.
For better analysing i can send a file including cat /proc/pic, pci-config,
alta-diag -e and alta-diag -m bevor and after sending some pings.
This file is a some more pages long so i don't know if it is ok to send it to
the mailing list.
with regards
Holger
