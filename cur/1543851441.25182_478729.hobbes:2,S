Sure, since for example I'm not subscribed (fortunately) to lkml, and I
think you want me to answer the question too...

epoll can not be improved, since the whole polling is designed to have
several layers of dereferencing, kevent simplifies that chain noticebly.

kevent exists for about 10 month. We have plenty of time :)

pipes will work with kevent's poll mechanisms only, so there will not be
any performance gain at all since it is essentially the same as epoll
design with waiting and rescheduling (all my measurements with 
epoll vs. kevent_poll always showed the same rates), pipes require the same
notifications as sockets for maximum perfomance.
I've put it into todo list.

If there would exist sockets support, then I could patch it to work with
kevents.
