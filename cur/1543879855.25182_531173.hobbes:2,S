Hundret years ago some people told "people can fly depends on broken 
idea".
LVM was never defined strictly and no one says current LVM 
"definition/abstracion" is finished and complet .. try to think about this 
and never use phrases like "broken idea" when you have real proof for 
"people can fly" because you can simple look on sky or "embedding the 
equivalent of LVM into a filesystem _feels_ quite wrong" when you can
use real and working ZFS on some OSes .. specialy when this new 
"definition" of LVM provides better functionalities than current FS 
way of thinking about some OS aspects.
