I thought I saw a big difference in 2.4, but my latest runs could not 
reproduce this.  I also tested Andrea's version 
http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.19rc3aa1/30_irq-balance-12
which addresses some of the problems:

Before I tried hyperthreading, no balance was always best performance, but 
"unfair".  However, with hyperthreading, (Andrea's) IRQbalance can be the 
best, probably because an interrupt rate of that level just can't be 
processed by "1/2" of a CPU and would benefit from a distrubution.  I did 
make a run on 2.5.25 a few weeks ago.  With IRQbalance turned off, I was 10% 
better.  I have not had a chance to try Andrea's in 2.5 but I suspect it 
would be best overall, since he compensates for HZ:
#define IRQ_BALANCE_INTERVAL (HZ/50) 
and does not seem to reprogram the IO-APIC as often.  IMO, I think Andrea's 
version is a little less aggressive and has less overhead, something I'd 
prefer in 2.5.
