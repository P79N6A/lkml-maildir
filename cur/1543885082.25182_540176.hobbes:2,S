Hi Con, 
I have 2.6.21-ck1 running happily on a variety of machines. Everything seems 
fine on both uniprocessor and SMP machines. 
I've been running SD for a couple of weeks now, including alternating between 
a SD patched kernel and an "old" staircase based kernel for a week of that. 
SD seems perfectly smooth. In fact on going back to the old kernel for a day 
I'm sure it felt more "choppy". I don't really do benchmarks, "feel" is more 
relevant to me. Right now I'd say my R4 "feels" better with SD than it has 
for a long time. Nice Job. Thanks for persisiting.
As an aside I realized whilst trying non ck kernels the last few weeks just 
how much of a difference swap prefetch actually makes on a lowish memory 
machine such as this.
