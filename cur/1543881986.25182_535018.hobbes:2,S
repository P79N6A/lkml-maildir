Ok, I guess I'll have nightmares of DMA controllers doing DMAs from
chips that are no longer there tonight.

Only the fact that we are currently using same device call during
snapshot() and during restore(). We obviously could do _5_ device
calls
(suspend/resume/freeze/quiesce_disable_dma/thaw)
...but that looks like too many calls to me.

I'm not comfortable with memory I'm copying changing under my hands
because of some DMA. It just looks like asking for trouble. I _think_
we can get away with DMA running during snapshot, because driver may
not assume anything about the DMA result before it got completion
interrupt, but...
