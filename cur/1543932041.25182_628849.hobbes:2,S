Subject: kconfig: Obey KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG choices with randconfig.

Currently when using KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG with randconfig the choice options
are clobbered. As recommended by Roman, this adds an is_new test to see
whether to select a new option or obey the existing one.
This is a resend of the earlier patch a couple of weeks ago, since there
was no reply. Original thread is at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/28/94
It would be nice to have this for 2.6.24.
