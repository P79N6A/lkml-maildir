Plus it is pretty simple if you compile for a single architecture to
kill the function pointers.  That is how the alpha is currently structured.
So for the people who don't want it switchable the code can just compile
out.
Getting this infrastructure now before i386 becomes primarily and embedded
architecture will be nice.
