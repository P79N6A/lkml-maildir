This problem appeared in early 2.3.x kernels.  I believe I first saw it
in 2.3.11.
Scenerio: Let your disk fill very close to full.  Erase a few hundred
megabytes of data so you can work on other things.  Disk stays "full." 
Your apps give you many many errors of such.
in 2.3.x<26 (26 may have been included in this), it never recovers.  It
takes a reboot to get your disk space back.
In 2.3.x>28 (may include 26, I cant remember), two or three fails and
then bam, you have your space back.
Sync doesn't fix this.  It seems to take failed writes.
I am not sure how to get more detailed than this or how to create a test
for you all save the conditions I observed.  I am using an up to date (I
believe) RedHat 6.1 base.
