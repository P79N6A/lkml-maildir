Sounds like you didn't make or install modules. Most kernels these days
are best built using modules for device drivers and such that are loaded
on-demand during runtime, instead of being part of a big 'monolithic'
kernel. This saves space in memory and has some other benefits (although
this is open to debate).
`make bzImage` makes just the 'monolithic' part of the kernel, while `make
modules` and `make modules_install` handle building and installing modules,
and should create the proper directories and put in the appropriate files.
If you did execute the modules commands (as root, of course), the problem
might be in your module loader program suite (insmod, lsmod, etc.). Old
versions of the program don't work with newer kernels. I'm not a RedHat user
so I wouldn't know about that, but you could check their site and download
the latest RPM if that seems to be the problem.
