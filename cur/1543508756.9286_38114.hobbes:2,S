Well, I would like to say that RAID is not yet *non-experimental* yet.  I
can see not requiring tool upgrades for things that are stable (like
binutils, or lilo, or something like that).  But RAID isn't yet 1.0.
It is mood though. Mingo has spoken, RAID is not going in 2.2.  I can agree
with his descision, it makes sense.
KNFSD is another story, but even that is looking like it will be taken
care of.  So all is becoming well.  I am happy.
Ciao!
