You should check out the tests we just released.  They are
"quickhitters" which are very simple tests that exercise system calls.
You can run quichitters with a "-c n" option which creates n copies of
the test and runs them simultaneously.  
Unfortunately some of the tests were written without this in mind and
tend to step on their own toes.  This is definately something that needs
to be fixed.  The simple fix is to move the tst_tmpdir() call after the
TEST_PAUSE.  A real fix requires more changes.  If anyone would like a
full explaination, I would happy to supply them with one.
