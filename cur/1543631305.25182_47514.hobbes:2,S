  I agree that the proc code isn't good (maybe you missed the mail from
Christoph Hellwing and my answer to it...) and should be replaced.

  The hope isn't futile I think. At least quota tools (which are
IMHO the most interesting) are checking the version and warning user
about too new kernel.

  The version isn't there only for format of that quota file in proc.
It's *mainly* used for detection of kernel interface to use. Previously
tools had to try a few quotactl()s and from their results they had to
guess the quota format etc. With version somewhere it's a bit easier...
  Looking forward to next flame from you ;)
