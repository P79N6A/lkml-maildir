I need some kernel event that has both DEVICE and MODALIAS set. 
up to including kernel 2.6.21 this seems to come from 
drivers/usb/core/driver.c if I read the code correctly, and then
it was removed.
udevmonitor --kernel --environment shows one event with both on 2.6.21 plain, 
but not on 2.6.22 plain.
