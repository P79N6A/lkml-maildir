I completely agree with you on reclaim consuming time.
Churning the LRU can be avoided by the means I mentioned before
1. Add a container pointer (per page struct), it is also
    useful for the page cache controller
2. Check if the page belongs to a particular container before
    the list_del(&page->lru), so that those pages can be skipped.
3. Use a double LRU list by overloading the lru list_head of
    struct page.
