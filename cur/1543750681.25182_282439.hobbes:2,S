I'm as newbie as they get but the above command just made my system 
freeze hard and I could do nothing but reboot (use the power switch). I 
had nothing mounted there but have a directory
under /mnt where I occasionaly mount my samba share. (which was not 
mounted when I tried this) . So much for user friendlyness ... oh well ...
