Subject: PATCH: 2.4.0-test12-pre3: fix ntfs BUG() call
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/11/30/160

Attached patch fixes the BUG() people are seeing when using the ntfs
driver with 2.4.0-test* kernels. Patch is tested and everything seems to
be working fine with it. 
Description:
The BUG() call was due to a not implemented ntfs_get_block().
The fix is to comment out all [bm]map associated code since if any of it
is used it results in the BUG().
I haven't removed the code altogether, since, once ntfs_get_block is
implemented, the rest of the code can just be uncommented and it should
all work.
This patch has been submitted to Linus for inclusion in the next
2.4.0.test* kernel.
Regards,
	Anton
