This doesn't explain the problem entirely, I considered a negative 
xtime_nsec before, but xtime_nsec+offset should still be positive and 
produce the correct result, at least I can't find anything in 
getnstimeofday(). It should also be a very rare event, so it's really 
puzzling that it's so easy to reproduce.
So there must be more to it than just a negative xtime_nsec, it triggers 
the problem, but it's not the actual problem. One possible explanation is 
this line:
	clock->xtime_nsec -= (s64)xtime.tv_nsec << clock->shift;
The rounding further increases the problem as the error is adjusted into 
the wrong direction and under the right conditions it seems to be possible 
to go out of sync as the error increasingly gets worse. I'd like to see 
some numbers to confirm this theory, in any case above line is incorrect 
for negative numbers.

I don't mind this solution, but to be precise it avoids the problem.
My favourite solution would involve improving the xtime handling, as it's 
not really necessary to copy the nsec value back and forth between xtime 
and xtime_nsec, but it requires going through all xtime users, especially 
all settimeofday implementations, which also have to set xtime_nsec so 
update_wall_time() doesn't has to read it in. Then it's possible to make 
xtime_nsec signed and allow it to be negative.
So avoiding the negative nsec value is the better shorttime solution, but 
I'd prefer you'd drop the second paragraph, instead of suggesting a broken 
solution I'd rather see a bit info about how to fix this properly, i.e. 
fixing the xtime handling, so it's safe to allow negative values.
