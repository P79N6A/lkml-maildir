I don't know who specifically I should cc this to, so bare with me on that.
I attempted to compile 2.3.43-8 on my laptop with a few pcmcia nics and one
cardbus nic.  Well, nothing will compile.
I get errors about structure has no member named.  Those members are:
tbusy
interrupt
start
also NET_BH is undeclared.
I just looked, this changed in -7
