Hello All,
af_unix.c is currenty built with KBUILD_MODNAME=unix. This seems to
work rather well today, but if someone actually tries to use
KBUILD_MODNAME then they will end up with a preprocessor surprise:
KBUILD_MODNAME -> unix -> 1, because "unix" is defined to 1.
With other words, if someone adds module_param(foo,...) code to
af_unix.c and compiles the code as built in then they will have to use
"1.foo" to set the variable instead of "unix.foo" as expected.
Solution? #undef unix?
I came across this when trying to autogenerate parameter documentation...
