Hrm... This is with 2.2.18:
[18:17:15] hogarth@theirongiant:/data>> dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=1024 count=4000000
dd: testfile: File too large
2097152+0 records in
2097151+0 records out
[18:21:07] hogarth@theirongiant:/data>> rm testfile
[18:24:16] hogarth@theirongiant:/data>> 
So it worked for me... Regardless though have you tried
>testfile
rm testfile
?
