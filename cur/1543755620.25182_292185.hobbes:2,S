Currently it's nightly.  Larry has offered to run it more often if
someone can provide a dedicated fast machine to run it on.  (Larry: is
it a matter of memory or of CPU or both?  If nothing else we should
have the old kernel.org server, dual P3/1133 with 6 GB RAM, coming
free soon.)
Please let me know if there is something that should be put on
kernel.org; we can host repositories there of course.
