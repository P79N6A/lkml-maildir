Your design is nice and simple to take the priority based scheduling
to the next level.
Whereas what CKRM provides is resource management and monitoring, which
is more than prioritizing group of users for scheduling.
It allows one to manage/monitor different groups of applications(that
are related or non-related).
With CKRM, you can provide resource control support for features
like UML and virtual servers to make them more controllable 
domains(term domain used loosely) in terms of resource management.

One clarification: CKRM is the infrastruture, What you are referring 
is the CPU controller(whish is a module to mange the resource CPU), which
can be replaced by a simplistic one(like the one you propose) or turned
off if needed.
That is one of the advantage the architecture provides, it removed resource
specific details from the core functionality CKRM provided, so that it
remains flexible(in choosing the resources you want to control) and
expandable easily(to support additional resources).
