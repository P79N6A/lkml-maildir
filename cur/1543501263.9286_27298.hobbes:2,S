Subject: Forced unmounts possible?

Here is a  scenario that I have run into a couple of times.  I have an
nfs filesystem mounted.  The machine on which the filesystem physically
resides gets taken off the network and loaned out to a client for an
extended period of time.  Subsequent df's, etc. just hang.  umount
machine:/dir hangs.  umount -f machine:/mount reports that forced
unmounts are not yet supported.  The kernel on this particular machine
is 2.0.34 I think.  I hate taking a machine down over something like
this, but my real question here is whether it is possible to do this
under 2.2/2.3.  Any suggestions on the current problem with the 2.0.34
machine are also welcome, though. ;-)
