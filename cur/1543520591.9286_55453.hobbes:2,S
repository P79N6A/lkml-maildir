 "trampoline" code?  what is this?  Do you mean a 'thunk' (this term has
been around a very long time, please dont invent new ones), which is
code constructed in data space, and then executed ?  
 Many computer languages depend on this capability, via the stack and/or
heap.  While we are at it, would we also have to prevent runtime
constructed code from executing within heapspace (allowed on some
systems) ???  I see little distinction here...
