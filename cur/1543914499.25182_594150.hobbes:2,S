"current" has solid *historical* reasons for being that way.
Namely: it actually *was* a variable. That worked fine for UP. It got 
changed much much later.
Also, even in modern times, "current" is optimized to hell and back, and 
is often as cheap (or cheaper than) a global variable, so there is also no 
subtle performance question.
So using "current" as an excuse is not really valid. AT ALL.
