Oops! I forgot about that. With my custom kernels I had to change this
to use the generic find_first_bit routine. It's been a while since I
made these changes.  So when we really need to have custom settings, we
would have to change this.  I should have remembered this, since it did
cause me couple of days of debugging.  Anyway, I never did the
measurements, but does anyone know what the performance difference is
between find_first_bit and sched_find_first_bit? I guess I'll do it and
report back later.  This should also be in a comment around changing
these settings.
Thanks,
