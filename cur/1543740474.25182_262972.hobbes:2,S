VM_DIRTY flag would be problematic, since you need mmap_sem exclusively
to modify vm_flags, whereas faulting holds mmap_sem non-exclusively.
But if I understand you aright, testing vma->anon_vma should do it.

VM_SHM is a relic, there might be a driver or two still setting it,
but we should have deleted it long ago: you mean VM_RESERVED, I think.

Conceptually the right thing to do?  I think it's best left out until
that future internal use makes sense of it.  As it stands, I can't work
out what it's up to; and VM_MAYWRITE doesn't say if the backing store
was opened for writing, but whether the memory may be mprotected writable.
