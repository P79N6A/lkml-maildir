Honestly, this isn't at all what I understood you to be talking about. 
In your very first post you described ramback as "a new virtual device
with the ability to back a ramdisk by a real disk."  I assumed "ramdisk"
to mean the Linux psuedo-device.  I never understood that you meant an
external device, in fact I thought ramback was *instead of* a Violin. 
Since you're talking about external ram, it survives operating system
crashes and of course that is not such a big deal as I was thinking.
