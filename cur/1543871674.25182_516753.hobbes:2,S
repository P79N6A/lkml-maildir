Damn.  I missed that.

I should have, yes.

I'd rather not do that as the inline assembly variants then have to special
case ilog2(0) rather than just having an undefined result.

Unfortunately, I can't disagree.

It was tested...  I've just re-examined my test program and I've realised I've
only tested power-of-2 parameters.  Sigh.

Well, that should be CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_ILOG2_U?? macros, and powerpc defines
those too.

True, for N being a non-power-of-two, unfortunately; and also where evaluating
N has side-effects.

Not true, just that my userspace test program isn't sufficiently exhaustive.

Unfortunately so.

Not true.
Various archs (including i386, x86_64, powerpc and frv) have instructions that
can be used to calculate integer log2(N).  The fallback position is to use a
loop:
	size = (size - 1) >> (PAGE_SHIFT - 1);
	order = -1;
	do {
		size >>= 1;
		order++;
	} while (size);

Probably a good idea.  I'll work on it some more and improve my test program
(which is actually quite simple to do).
