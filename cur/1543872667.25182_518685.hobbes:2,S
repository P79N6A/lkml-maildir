You are. Each page has only one page_container associated
with it despite the number of containers it is shared
between.

As I've already answered in my previous letter simple
limiting w/o per-container reclamation and per-container
oom killer isn't a good memory management. It doesn't allow
to handle resource shortage gracefully.
This patchset provides more grace way to handle this, but
full memory management includes accounting of VMA-length
as well (returning ENOMEM from system call) but we've decided
to start with RSS.
