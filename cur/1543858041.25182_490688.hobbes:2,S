That's for the 80319 ... Riku said he was using 80219, that
could imply some differences.  And I distinctly recall Intel's
XScale docs having a few problems whereby "live" silicon bugs
didn't always stay in the "spec update" documents, so it's
possible that older docs would be needed.
At this point all we really _know_ is that requests made
through 80219's i2c controller don't give the correct result
(at least on Riku's 80219 board) and moreover seem to have a
consistent failure mode ... whereas ones made with OMAP's
controller (and presumably that of the original driver author,
for a Synology DS-101 presumably with IXP420) do act ok.
