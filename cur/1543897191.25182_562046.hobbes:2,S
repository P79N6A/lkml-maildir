How do you know 165MB/s is correct?
As for 10k rpm being faster, well remember rotation speed _and_ areal
density is what gives transfer rate.  a 750GB 7200rpm is likely able to
have a higher throughput than a 73GB 10k rpm drive since more bits pass
by the head in any given unit of time on the larger drive.  The 7200 rpm
has a slower average access time though.
