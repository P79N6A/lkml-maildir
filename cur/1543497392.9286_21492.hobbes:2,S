What happens if one would want to run PPP over IrDA (or comparable links)
which requires some formatting before the PPP serial data goes out the
serial port.
Since PPP hooks into the tty as a line discipline, it would be necessary
to make a dummy tty-like device, to which PPP would hook in and which
would then process/format the data. The other end of the dummy-tty would
connect as a line discipline on the actual physical tty ? That sounds a
bit complicated, any other ideas on how to do it ?
