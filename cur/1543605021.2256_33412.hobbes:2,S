See how fragile it is?  
It only really works if the underlying devices are real drives with
major number less than 16, and that are among the first 16 real
devices with that major number (not counting different partitions on
the device).

With striped mirrors there are more combinations of two drives that
can fail without data loss, and less data needs to be copied during a
resync.  Also, hotadd is easier  - you don't have to build a raid0 and
then hot-add that, you just hot-add a drive.
It is odd that you still aren't getting good rebuild speed.  What
drives to you have and how are they connected to what controllers?
