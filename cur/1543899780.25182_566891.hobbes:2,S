n things -- n number of things (n calls to kmem_cache_alloc()).
Just a fancy way of saying roughly that memory waste will increase as
the size of the system increases. But that aspect of it I think is
not really a problem for non-tiny systems anyway because the waste
tends not to be too bad (and possibly the number of active allocations
does not increase O(n) with the size of RAM either).
