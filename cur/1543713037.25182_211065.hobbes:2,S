Oracle needs this sysctl, I designed it and Ken Chen implemented it. I
guess google also won't dislike it.
This is a lot simpler than the mlock rlimit and this is people really
need (not the rlimit). The rlimit thing can still be applied on top of
this. This should be more efficient too (besides its simplicity).
can you apply to mainline?
