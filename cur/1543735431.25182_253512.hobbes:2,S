I'm getting lots of rejects from these.  At the fifth patch I gave up.  The
rejects appear to be against stock 2.6.9-rc2.
Please regenerate these patches and double-check that they apply to latest
-linus tree.  Or against next -mm if they are dependent upon Gerd's
patches:
v4l-msp3400-cleanup.patch
v4l-tuner-update.patch
v4l-bttv-update.patch
v4l-dvb-cx88-driver-update.patch
