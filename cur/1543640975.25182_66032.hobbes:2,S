Subject: ad1848 causes infinite loop in 2.4.19

I have an opl3sa4 sound card which requires the opl2sa2 and
ad1848 modules.
When I try to lood this module it fails to auto-configure the sound card 
(which is a known problem and for which I have submitted patches). But 
then it runs trough the init setup in an infinite loop blocking the 
kernel. In particular it prints
ad1848: OPL3-SA2 WSS mode ad1848 config failed (out of resources?)[-2]
over and over on the console. This did not happen with 2.4.18.

PS: My fix for the isapnp activation of the opl3sa4 card did not
show up in the 2.4.19 kernel (with my patch the above problem
will not occure). How do I find out the current status of my
patches. Should I resubmit them?
