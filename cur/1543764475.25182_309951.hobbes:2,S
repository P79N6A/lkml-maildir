Subject: [PATCH 2.6.12-rc2 1/2] ppc32: fix for misreported SDRAM size on Radstone PPC7D platform
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This patch fixes the SDRAM output from /proc/cpuinfo.
The previous code assumed that there was only one bank
of SDRAM, and that the size in the memory configuration
register was the total size.
