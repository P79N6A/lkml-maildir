I guess my position is that storing the capabilities of a file should be
done with inode attributes. Such support should ultimately reside within
the filesystem and be regulated by the kernel.
Y2K's patch as I understand it, is a filter that one can use to mask the
capabilities that a file would otherwise inadvertently inherit. In the
absence of filesystem support, and without access to the source code for
the program, I can see this as a useful feature, but no more so than the
execcap and sucap wrappers distributed with libcap (*). [I should
confess that Pavel's patch is not something I've examined closely.]
There already exists a patch to add VFS layer support to Linux 2.2 (*),
and I'll make sure it compiles with 2.3 . This patch provides some
module hooks (and I've made such a module available) to add effective
capability support for files under any filesystem. That said, this is
not something I want to see in 2.3 "just yet", as it has a few rough
edges and is missing mount/umount support.
I guess that's my comment.
Cheers
Andrew

Code I'm intending to submit for inclusion with 2.3 (but at this stage
is relative to 2.2)
and includes updated libraries and kernel patches for VFS support:
