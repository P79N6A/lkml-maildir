No, most of these are one time init calls.  The problem before was the 
default subarch couldn't define weak symbols, since setup.c was in the 
subarch itself and not in arch/i386/kernel.  Do weak symbols work with 
all tool chains?

No - if you rename machine_halt to subarch_machine_halt, you again can't 
add a new subarch interface without changing all subarchitectures.  If I 
add voyager_smp_bless_voyage(), I now need to add #define 
visws_smp_bless_voyage default_smp_bless_voyage, ... or did you mean 
subarch_machine_halt literally?

I think weak symbols are the best approach, if they indeed work with all 
tool chains.
