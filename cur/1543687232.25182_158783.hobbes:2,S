Please set the preferred source for eth1 to $(IP_OF_ETH1)
and the preferred source for eth3 to $(IP_OF_ETH3) then
do this:
bash# echo "1" >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth1/arp_filter
bash# echo "1" >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth3/arp_filter
This also will make applications connecting using unspecified
source addresses behave more sanely as well.
The thing you claim is the right thing to do is the wrong thing
to do in environments other than your own.
