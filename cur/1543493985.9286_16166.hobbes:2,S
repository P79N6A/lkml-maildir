I havenae seen any comments re this being definately fixed, and
haven't had reason to change HZ on my systems, so I will plead
ignorance of the current status.
As you appear to be better informed than me, can you answer a few
questions on this subject please?
 1. There is presumably a maximum rate to which HZ can be set that
    is dictated by the hardware. What is it?
 2. There is presumably also a separate maximum rate to which HZ
    can be set before the timer interrupt routine starts taking
    too large a proportion of the inter-timer-interrupt intervals.
    This will of course be dependant on the processor and its
    speed, but is there any sort of formula to determine what this
    will be for any given processor?
 3. Am I right in thinking that the jiffies counter is a 32-bit
    counter? If so, would I be right in thinking that the maximum
    interval that can be measured is (2^32-1.0)/HZ seconds ?
If I'm right, then the above between them will set the maximum rate to
which HZ can be set on any given machine.
Comments?
Best wishes from Riley.
