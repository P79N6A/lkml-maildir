Hi folks,
Last night, probably an hour after I should have gone to bed, my system
started acting up. When I tried to print something, it asked if lpd was
running. I checked with ps and indeed it was not,so I tried to restart
it. No luck. Finally I rebooted to see what would happen. My dialer
refused to connect and told me to check my logs, which told me that pppd
died because it could not get an address. I booted old kernels,
recompiled new ones. Nothing worked. Then I did df and saw that my /
partition was full. Doh. None of the error messages I got suggested
such. Maybe update or the like could to do a simple check and warn of
such when vital resources get dangerously low.
