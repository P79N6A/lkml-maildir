seconded! I have tried the patchset and it works great for me. This 
limitation of Linux has bothered me almost since i started using Linux 
more than a decade ago (i remember having run into it when running a 
script on an overly large directory), and it's perhaps the oldest still 
existing userspace-visible limitations of Linux. It was also a really 
hard nut to crack. Kudos Peter! I really cant wait to see this in 2.6.23
:-)
