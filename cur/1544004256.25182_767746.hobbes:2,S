KSM needs to convert anonymous pages to PageKSM, which means a page
owned by ksm.c and only known by ksm.c. The Linux VM will free this
page in munmap but that's about it, all we do is to match the number
of anon-ptes pointing to the page with the page_count. So besides
freeing the page when the last user exit()s or cows it, the VM will do
nothing about it. Initially. Later it can swap it in a nonlinear way.
