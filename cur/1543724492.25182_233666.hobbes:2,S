I'll second this.  I moved to 2.6 because I needed a slew of drivers 
that were difficult to patch into 2.4 or out of date or etc.  
However, I haven't had a working 2.6 swsusp for probably 4 months or 
so (since I stopped using the 2.6.3 version after it ate my ext3 
journal on my root partition).
I suppose I could look at going back to 2.4....
