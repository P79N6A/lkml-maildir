Maybe that is the answer here..
What if the kernel build would write a file called
'/boot/enviornment-2.2.14' when you installed it. This file would be a
make/shell compatible file that simply consisted of parameters. An
example,
BUILDROOT=/usr/local/src/linux-2.2/14/
INCLUDEROOT=/usr/local/src/linux-2.2/14/include/
KERNELCONFIG=/boot/config-2.2.14
CPPFLAGS=-D_SMP_
KERNELVERSION=2.2.14
[..]
The contents would be generated as part of the kernel build process.
Then if the end user wanted to compile a module it is as simple as the
vendor doing a make statement like
ENV=/build/environment-$(shell uname -r)
include $(ENV)
This way the problem of a standard path for the kernel source goes away, I
can unpack it where ever I like, so long as it doesn't move around all the
3rd party modules can find it without any trouble. It also nicely solves
the problems with getting the right compile options and probably other
things too.
Pre-build kernel images that Distributors produce could include a file
like the above that points to the path in the matching -headers package.
I've authored a few modules, and I do agree with the sentiment that this
should be made more standard - I really don't want to write all the hacks
that the ALSA people use :|
