Actually, the OOPS has nothing to with my code.  Try loading any module
that uses a slab cache (nfs is a good example).  Unload the module and
cat /proc/slabinfo - OOPS.  Soon your machine will hang (I think it happens
when another slab is added to the cache).  It is sometimes not possible to
reload the module.  The reason for the hang is that the "name" field is
in the memory space of the module, and it isn't there when the module is
unloaded, hence "cat /proc/slabinfo" gets an OOPS when sprintf'ing the name.
This is one problem which I already have a patch for (limit 20 character
names, which is long enough for all of the caches in the current kernel
code - and there is now a length check).

When can you use multiple caches of the same name?  Either it is a name
conflict, which is one issue that can be solved, or you are repeatedly
allocating the same cache.  Try
modprobe nfs; rmmod nfs; insmod nfs; cat /proc/slabinfo
Now you have two sets of all the nfs slab caches, the old one never being
used.  How bad will it get if you have auto-load and -unload of a module
which is using a cache?  In my patch, you will get the same cache back if
all of your allocate parameters are the same (name, size, offset, flags,
ctor, and dtor).  However, even though I verified the cache pointer was
returned the same, the first slab allocation failed in my test.  It may be
that there is still a bug in my patch, which I haven't tested thoroughly
yet (this part is not included here).

Actually, I tried both shrink and destroy without success.  If destroy does
work, then this may be a solution.  However, I have a hard time finding any
usage of kmem_cache_destroy()...  USB driver uhci gets around the "name
pointing to unloaded memory" by kmallocing 16 bytes for the name, but it still
is using shrink instead of destroy, so someone with USB could probably test
and see if it creates a new slab cache each time it is loaded and unloaded.
Cheers, Andreas
