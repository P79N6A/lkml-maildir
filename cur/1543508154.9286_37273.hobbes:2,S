Actually, the PCI interrupt mapping tables are often available without
using any BIOS calls.  You can just scan 0xf0000-0xfffff for a special
signature ('$PIR') and read the table directly: this is one of the
defined ways of retrieving this information.  I do this in the current
PCMCIA code to get the interrupt assignments for CardBus bridges.
