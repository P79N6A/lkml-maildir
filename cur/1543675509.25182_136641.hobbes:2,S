Of course. Your example would probably be too low-level for
most such checkers, and might better be handled by run-time
checks (e.g. through something like valgrind).
Also, a template check wouldn't have to cover all equivalent
coding variants. E.g. if the template just allows one kind
of loop, it's probably always acceptable to change code that
uses an equivalent alternative.
Furthermore, if someone figures out a way for doing things
more efficiently, it should be easier to update drivers that
conform to a well-known status quo ante.

Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
