I was thinking of a similar one by Mike Waychison.  It had the problem
of requiring a spinlock for mntget/mntput.  It was also different in
that it did not gradually dissolve detached trees, but kept them as
whole blobs until the last ref went away.

How will this work with copy_tree() and namespace duplication, which
currently walk the tree with only namespace_sem held?

OK, I'll digest this info.
