No, the plug is great. It's doing exactly what needs to be done, and it's
really simple.
The problem is that the limited requeuing thing we have now is not really
fully aware of it. I definitely want plugging to stay, it allows us to
essentially do a simple kind of "anti-nagle" on disk requests from a
higher level without having to worry about all the nasty implications.
