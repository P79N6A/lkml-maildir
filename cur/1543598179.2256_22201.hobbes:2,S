Yes, it is in my machine 400Mhz Celeron Medocino 128Mb
RAM and only 72Mb swap.
Lastime I try running several big apps 
- compiling Mozilla 
- Star Office with several swd document opened
- Netscape comunicator 477
- 3 rxvt and mc running ; several windows of xpdf to
view some document
-after finisshing compling mozilla, start it 
use mozilla to browse
No slow down at all
swap usages: around 56Mb
And it does free swap properly
Good job
Cheers,
