You're right, it's $79.95 for the whole laptop at the buy-it-now price
on Ebay, go get it.

Indeed.  So how about you go make a test tree with BK and the same test
tree with CVS, do a set of operations like checkout, update, etc., with
both and report back on the bandwidth stats?  What you'll find is that
they are about the same for the initial checkout, BK will be a bit more
actually because it copies the revision files not the checked out files,
and then for ever subsequent operation, BK is less.
Suppose you have the linux-2.5 tree and you want to get the USB tree,
you can _locally_ clone the 2.5 tree to usb and then pull from the USB
tree.  Thereby saving lotso bandwidth.  One of our developers is behind
a modem and he does this sort of thing all the time.
