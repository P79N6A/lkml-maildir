Acknowledge corrections 1 and  3 readily.  Treated vma_merge
as block box that can handle all cases.  Motivation for pointless
case 3 is to skip holes and did not notice that has been covered.  Thanks for
corrections.

Correction 2 is tricky.  Sometimes it merges similar to case 3,
misses a needed split,  where after the fix  we can get case 4
merge. If that is what you are saying, we are in agreement.  Otherwise,
can you explain the real problem?
Thanks,
Prasanna.
