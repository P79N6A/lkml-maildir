I see.  So you need some way of identifying the block size and
whether sparse superblocks are enabled to find the real superblock.
I don't suppose using a "magic number" head and tail on the superblock
is a viable option here? Say 4 bytes at the head and tail of the
superblock that would allow for a search for a valid superblock. 
It would require significant changes, but should be robust enough
for about any service.  Especially since the odds of random data
reproducing a valid signature at a valid potential location are
minimal. Of course the search only gets invoked if the specified
superblock is not present/valid and after checking with the user.
