Not currently.

Although these are available to user space, they're not easily controlled
from anything outside the serial driver at the moment.  I'm aware of this
limitation, and it needs to be fixed; there are keyboards (eg) for the iPAQ
that need to bitbang these signals.
Unfortunately that doesn't help you.
