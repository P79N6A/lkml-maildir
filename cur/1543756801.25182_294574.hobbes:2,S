Works for me (Vaio PCG-GR214EP). Tested with 2.6.11-rc3-bk8.
I then enabled the debug mode. I couldn't find anything relevant WRT
what each additional file is supposed to do, but I still have noticed a
number of things you might be interested in.
ctr doesn't seem to affect the contrast for me. I also noticed that the
value seems to be stored on 8 bits. Higher bits are ignored (e.g. write
300, read 44). Default value is 64.
cmi behaves strangely. Its default value is 0. Whatever I write to it
(including 0), next read returns 131.
pbr seems to be stored on 4 bits. Higher bits are ignored (e.g. write
20, read 4). Default value is 0.
csxb is the dangerous one. Default 0. Writing 41 to it deadlocked my
system. Writing 42 changed pbr from 0 to 8 as a side effect. Each write
generates an error in the logs:
  sony_acpi: acpi_evaluate_object failed
cmi and csxb are reset to 0 on sony_acpi module cycling. brightness, ctr
and pbr are preserved.
Hope that helps. Let me know if you want me to test specific things.
