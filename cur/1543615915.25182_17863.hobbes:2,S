Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a really nice place to put
generic SMP startup code. Each arch defines it's own per-cpu startup
code. As Matt asked in a private email, it would require hacks to each
arch to support this (Matt: this is my reply:-). While it would be
fairly simple to add a call to a devfs_cpu_register() function to each
arch, this does seem a bit hackish.
So I'd like to propose a new file (say kernel/smp.c) which has generic
startup code for each CPU. To start with, it can have a
generic_cpu_init() function, which is called by each arch. Note that
this function would be called for the boot CPU too.
Comments?
