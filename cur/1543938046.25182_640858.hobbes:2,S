The access denied message in the dmesg log reveals no more information
than strace on stat of a local file does (which also returns access
denied and displays access denied), but I agree that logging on
-EACCESS on lookup does clutter the log.
I think it is ok to log a message on unexpected errors (for
QueryPathInfo those would include anything other than ENOENT and
EACCESS - Simo, can you think of others?)  I don't mind ratelimiting
logging on this clause (for errors other than ENOENT and EACCESS) but
it would complicate the code for a case I have not seen in the wild.
I prefer the following to remove the log cluttering on this case:
