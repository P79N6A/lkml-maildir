Subject: [PATCH 2.6.14-rc1 1/1] IPW2100/2200: Question on menuconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch makes the IPW2100 and IPW2200 options available in
the configuration menu even if IEEE80211 has not been selected before.
This behaviour is more intuitive for people which are not familiar with
the driver internals.
The suggestion for this change was made by Alejandro Bonilla Beeche.
