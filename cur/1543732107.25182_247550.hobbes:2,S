the Intel docs suggest a cache-flush when changing MTRR's, so i guess
we've got to live with this. _Perhaps_ we could move the cache-disabling
and the wbinvd() out of the spinlocked section, but this would make it
preemptable, possibly causing other tasks to run with the CPU cache
disabled! I'd say that is worse than a single 0.5 msec latency during
MTRR setting.
