Use the source, Keith :-)
You need to pass the kernel apm=smp-power-off at boot time.  I did it this
way so that it is hard to do by default, as it is not strictly safe - it
just seems to work for lots of folks.  I figured if I made it so
hard to do by accident, the Linus would actually add it to the
standard kernel :-)
