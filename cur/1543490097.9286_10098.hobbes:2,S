   The trivial fix isn't always the correct one. The value of OFFSET_MAX
   may depend on the filesystem used. In particular for NFSv2, the offset
   remains a 32-bit quantity whatever your architecture, and so
   OFFSET_MAX wants to be 32-bit as well...
umm, i don't believe that's a concern here. for things that have
pre-determined offset sizes like nfs, they should just prevent you
from explicitly creating a lock that's greater than 2^31. the native
os, however, may be perfectly happy dealing with such quantities
despite the fact that you can't access them through some particular
means. with an off_t that can take values up to 2^63, not re-setting
the OFFSET_MAX on 64-bit linux machines opens them up to potential
problems.
