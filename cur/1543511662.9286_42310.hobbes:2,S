I should add that there is a certain other browser that, at last check,
doesn't send a "\r\n" at the end of the posted data, which, according to
the latest HTTP spec is actually correct.  However, since netscape does
send these bytes, it is best to have a stack that can either handle
closing a socket with data outstanding in a clean manner, or else where
you can check for the availabililty of data.  A web server should
probably read Content-Length bytes from the client after the headers,
then query the socket to see if there is more data outstanding.  If so,
read it.  With the advent of real HTTP/1.1 compliance in netscape (if it
ever happens), they will be forced to remove the extra two bytes from
the posted data, since that would interfere with pipelining requests. 
As it is, it makes persistent connections difficult.  End of rant.
