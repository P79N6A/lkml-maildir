When I did that, fumes of an in-kernel implementation invaded my head for 
a little while. Then you start thinking that you have to teach apps of new 
open(2) semantics, you have to bloat kernel code a little bit and you have 
to deal with a new set of errors cases that open(2) is not expected to 
deal with. A fully userspace implementation did fit my needs at that time, 
even if the LD_PRELOAD trick might break if weak aliases setup for open 
functions change inside glibc.
