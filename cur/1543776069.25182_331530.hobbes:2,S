Hi, all
I have a bash script that calls a small application several times 
(around 50 calls) that just send and receives data through an already 
open tcp socket to a local server through the loopback device. It also 
launches another small app several times that just reads a small file 
from disk and does some processing on it in memory.
We noticed a severe performance regression on this application under 
kernel 2.6.12.2 that we tracked down to the address space randomization 
patches:
# echo 0 > randomize_va_space
# time ./script
real    0m0.671s
user    0m0.293s
sys     0m0.325s
# echo 1 > randomize_va_space
# time ./script
real    0m3.310s
user    0m2.712s
sys     0m0.401s
Notice that the real time is 5x slower with "randomize_va_space" turned 
on. This is on a Transmeta Crusoe TM5600 at 533MHz.
What is weird is that most of the extra time is being accounted as 
user-space time, but the user-space application is exactly the same in 
both runs, only the "randomize_va_space" parameter changed.
I browsed the randomization patch code and I don't think the random 
calculations themselves could account for all that time.
Does anybody have a clue as to why this is happening or what I should do 
to debug this further?
