ACK.  However, I'm still not seeing *ANYTHING* that would look like a workable
scheme in presense of hardlinks.  Show me how to make that deadlock- and
race-free and we might very well do it in VFS.
_That_ is what's missing and it's needed no matter where it's implemented.
You want hybrid objects - you want to solve that one.  So far I've seen
nothing workable.
