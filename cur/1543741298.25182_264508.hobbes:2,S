I really didn't want to pursue this further, but...

You can always boot with a rescue CD or something, assuming that you 
don't have a stupid file system (I think there is none in Linux) that 
mounts even with the wrong magic number and trashes the block device 
contents.
(why would you need confidential information to boot in the first place?)

No it is not. You would just type in again *if* the contents of nvram 
got lost which shouldn't happen in the first place (or at least happen 
rarely).
This is a "just in case" scenario, not a everytime scenario liake the 
passphrase approach.
As I said before, I have no strong feelings about this patch, I just 
don't like to see things defeated over false arguments...
