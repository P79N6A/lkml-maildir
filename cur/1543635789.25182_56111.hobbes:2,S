Hi.
A couple of days ago I posted a script that converts structure
initializers from the form ...
struct foo = {
	field:	val
}
to 
struct foo = {
	.field = val
}
The latest version of the script is attached. This version
changes more structures, as well as adds a few missed fields
to the conversion. I'm running a kernel based on the code
that the script converted, so the output works here.
I've heard from Rusty Russell regarding the earlier version
of the script, and will possibly be sending him patches based
on the output. The script changes 679 files in my kernel, so
that is a lot of potential patches.
As for the script itself, I confess it's gotten a bit uglier
as I added more things that it knows to convert.
My thanks to everyone working on the kernel.
Art Haas
