Yep, as Mike mentioned, renicing X causes it to get bigger
timeslices with the stock scheduler. If you had 2 nice -20 processes,
they would each get a timeslice of 200ms, so you're harming their
latency.

Well it would be nice if someone could find out how to do it, but I
think that if we want X to be able to get 80% CPU when 2 other CPU hogs
are running, you have to renice it.
