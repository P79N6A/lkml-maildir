I've been writing one to provide all the Windows kernel objects in Linux
kernel space (the speed up appears as though it should be impressive). It is,
however, not entirely complete yet. You can grab a copy by CVS from the wine
repository:
	export CVSROOT=:pserver:cvs@cvs.winehq.com:/home/wine
	cvs login
	  (the password is cvs)
	cvs -z3 checkout kernel-win32
Or you can browse it:
	
http://cvs.winehq.com/cvsweb/kernel-win32/
The numbers are looking good: the system call latency appears to be about half
that of Win2000 on the same box! (however, use this number with caution).
