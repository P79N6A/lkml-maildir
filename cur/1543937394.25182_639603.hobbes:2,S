I'm so incredibly sick of this fucking thread. We've had enough legacy farts 
coming out of the woodwork advertising their own massive experience and 
cluelessness by now. Both hpa and alan are in this thread and everyone else 
can be ignored on the issue.
Over the course of a 100 messages or so in this thread it's been determined 
that the best course of action is to keep the out for ISA and replace it 
with udelay() for chipset logic. Now go away.
Rene.
