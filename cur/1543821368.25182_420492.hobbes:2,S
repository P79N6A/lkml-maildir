Subject: [PATCH] Fix compile error "undefined reference" for sparc64.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi. Andrew-san.
This is to fix compile error against "undefined reference to 
`arch_add_memory'". This error occurred on sparc64.
This means that memory hotplug can be enable even if 
architecture doesn't have memory hotplug feature.
Sparsemem is useful even if it doesn't have memory hotplug.
So, this patch allows hotplug for only the architecture which have
memory hotplug feature (ia64, x86-32/64, ppc64 now).
Sparc64 can use sparsemem option by it.
This patch is for 2.6.17-rc3-mm1.
Please apply.
