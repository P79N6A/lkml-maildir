None, but Xen is using CS values that are very different from Linux:
xen/include/public/arch-x86_64.h:
#define FLAT_RING3_CS32 0xe023  /* GDT index 260 */
#define FLAT_RING3_CS64 0xe033  /* GDT index 261 */
#define FLAT_RING3_DS32 0xe02b  /* GDT index 262 */
#define FLAT_RING3_DS64 0x0000  /* NULL selector */
#define FLAT_RING3_SS32 0xe02b  /* GDT index 262 */
#define FLAT_RING3_SS64 0xe02b  /* GDT index 262 */
The main problem is that startup_64 depends on that CS is set to
__KERNEL_CS when it shouldn't. On top of that the purgatory code in
kexec-tools doesn't setup CS when using a 64-bit entry point. The
following (mangled) patch solves that for me:

That I don't understand, care to explain more?
