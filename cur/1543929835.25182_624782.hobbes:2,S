Subject: [patch 0/6] Linux Kernel Markers - Use Immediate Values Optimization
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
The Markers are meant to have a _very_ low impact on performance (even on
d-cache hits) when disabled. This is provided by the Immediate Values.
However, to be able to instrument code called from traps (NMI, MCE handler, all
code called by there functions and all traps that can be triggered by these),
the rock-solid implementation of the immediate values seems required. It,
however, comes at the cost of some added complexity.
This patch applies on 2.6.24-rc4-git3, after the 
Text Edit Lock
Immediate Values (redux)
Profiling Use Immediate Values
patchsets.
It could be interesting to queue this for 2.6.25 so we can also add basic kernel
instrumentation (patches follow).
Mathieu
