Well, I'm by no means a VM expert (not even a regular kernel hacker), 
but it seems to me that the sum of LowTotal and VmallocTotal is rather 
constant for the different settings. Alas, I cannot offer an 
explanation why this should be, so hopefully a knowledgeable person 
will shed some light on this issue.

When I am working on a problem I never think about beauty.  I think
only how to solve the problem.  But when I have finished, if the
solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.
