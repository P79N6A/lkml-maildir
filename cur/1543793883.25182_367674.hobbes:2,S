On IA64 we have one PTE for a huge page in a different region, so we 
cannot unmap a page sized section. Other architectures may have PTEs for 
each page sized section of a huge page. For those it may make sense 
(but then the management of the page is done via the first page_struct, 
which likely results in some challenging VM issues).
