Andi, sorry I misrepresented your statement.
I misread your original as saying that the risks due to SMP nanosecond
scale synchronisation problems can be ignored.  Implied from that, that
the small risk of one SMP process modifying a file while another checks
the timestamp can be ignored.  I misread this way because others have
suggested higher resolution solves the problem, and I believe it does not.
As you say above, multiple modifications within a single tick are not a
problem, do not have to be tracked, and therefore do not require SMP
sychronisation.
The SMP risk of missing a change after checking the timestamp is among
the risks I consider critical for an application which must not miss the
fact that a file has changed.  I do not want us to repeat the mistake of
1 second at a smaller timescale.
cheers,
