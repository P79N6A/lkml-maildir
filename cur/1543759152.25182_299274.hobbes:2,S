Or even "cpu idle".  Entering power saving modes shouldn't be such
a Big Deal.  Some of the variable scheduling timeout work has been
done specifically with the goal of letting the system use those low
power modes more generally, without needing user(space) input to
suggest that now would be a good time to conserve more milliWatts.
Of course, on systems that don't swap (or swsusp) there may be
dozens of different low-power "standby" states.  I'm not sure it
helps to try labeling them all through /sys/power/files.
