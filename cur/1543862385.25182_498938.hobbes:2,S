After writing that, I actually went back and *checked* the fine print.
It turns out that unless you have installed a not-yet-escaped release of
gcc, -mtune=core2 doesn't work, so it punts to -mtune=generic.  Wandering
over to 
http://gcc.gnu.org
 and searching the mailing lists, it seems that
on most of the benchmarks, -mtune=core2 was only a 0.5% or so win on most
stuff in its current form.
