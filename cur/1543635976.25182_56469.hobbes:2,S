Ehh?  It's been 100 on the majority of ARM.  If it's different in libproc,
the libproc is broken.  One (broken) machine type decided it would be a
good idea to change it to 1000.  Since no one has paid any attention
to this machine for some time, it's support code will get dropped if
they don't fix it before 2.6.
