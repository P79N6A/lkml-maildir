No. I am assuming you are installing the kernel on the machine you do
"make modules_install" on. Obviously it is possible to install a different
kernel image of the same version without updating the modules - but if you
do so, expect nasty things to happen anyway if you're using modules!

In more complex cases, find a more complex solution - this is a nice
simple solution which works for the typical case of building and
installing a kernel!
If you are DIY upgrading a box's kernel, this solution works fine. If
you're maintaining a distribution, you should be able to use this solution
without much extra effort. If you are building kernels to DIY upgrade
other machines, and don't bother copying /lib/modules/`uname -r` then you
need to find another solution. I doubt this scenario is common enough to
justify denying the vast majority of Linux users this facility!
