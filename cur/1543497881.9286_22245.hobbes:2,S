Unless I'm terrible off, this is the correct behavior for TCP/IP.
With TCP/IP connections start slow and speed up as they see bandwidth.
If you've already got congestion then the second connection will take
longer to get out of slow start.
Anyone know if there is currently a way with the current TC framework to
identify flows which are 'new' or still in slow-start? If there was you
could bump them to the front of the queue.
