Indeed; the bug in the uuid_strategy which you pointed out in the
random driver wasn't caused by the fact that we were using a
user-specified length (since the length was being capped to a maximum
value of 16).  The security bug was that the test was done on a signed
value, and copy_to_user() takes an unsigned value.
So your checker found a real bug, but it wasn't the one that the
checker thought it was.  :-)
Alan, I assume you've fixed this already, but here's a patch in case
you haven't.  Note this also fixes the problem the problem pointed out
by Florian Weimer about copy_to_user being passed a null pointer in
the RANDOM_UUID case.
