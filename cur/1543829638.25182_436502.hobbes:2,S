Is that a good idea?
I was under the impression that on large machines, the shear size of
the dentry_unused list makes scanning all of it under the dcache_lock
an unpleasant thing to do.
Do you not have easy access to the roots of all trees in your
super-block-sharing situation so that shrink_dcache_parent can be
called on them all?
I would have thought that we want to get rid of shrink_dcache_sb rather
than create more users of it ??

I think this is true, prune_dcache is serving two masters and is
overly complex as a result.
