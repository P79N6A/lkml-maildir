Hi Sean,
I'm glad things are a little further on for you!
Looking at your dmesg the asus bios is still buggy (but i'm not sure 
it's specifically affecting what you're seeing).

this isn't a big deal, but linux expects an apperture of >= 64MB, you 
may want to change this setting in your bios.

I seem to remember that this may be related to the bios doing the wrong 
workaround for the timer. on the nvidia chipsets this shouldn't be required.

you might want to try enabling ACPI 2.0 or something similar in your 
bios and use the HPET timer instead.

there are problems with the ACPI tables supplied by the bios. Linux is 
expecting to find these items and does not.

same as above, the acpi tables are missing information.

this may be nothing, but it does look a little disturbing (especially 
since it's the USB controller).

this is also disconcerting...
i'm not sure that i've provided a lot of enlightenment...
