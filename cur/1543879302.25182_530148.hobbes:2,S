I see. Okay, I'll try to cook something regarding capacity units.

Yes, sure. Feel free to add these attributes to the "standard" ones,
along with your drivers. See (1).

Yup.

(1) You're free to add your attribute to "standard" ones in
include/linux/battery.h if it's proven to widely used. Batteries which
do not have such attribute will not even notice that addition, so you
will not have to grep and modify other drivers.
So, that is plain matter of code duplication. If two or more battery
drivers have same attributes, then we can put it in battery.h.
If only one driver using it, then code duplication impossible, and
driver should keep this attribute private.
In handhelds.org tree we have two battery drivers with attributes you
see currently. Second driver is not ready for mainline inclusion yet
(it depends on ADC framework, which we'll present soon), thus I've not
posted it.
Also, APM emulation driver should learn how to use one attribute, or
another depending on which available/better. But this is only technical
question, like
if (battery have attribute1)
	do precise maths of something, because we have mWh;
else
	do approx maths of something, because we have only mAh.
else
	n/a.
