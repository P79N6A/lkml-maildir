     I've found out that it's impossible to compile kernel without
   networking support (problem appeared in 2.4.15). Patch which
   fixes problem (just remove some includes which aren't really
   needed) is attached.
A fix for this is pending in my queue to Marcelo.
Please be patient, 2.4.17 will surely have this fixed :)
