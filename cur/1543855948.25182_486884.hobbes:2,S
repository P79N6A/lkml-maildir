Ummm...  I wonder if we should instead change the behaviour of
atomic_add_unless() to include an explicit smp_rmb() between the read and the
conditional jump on all archs where this isn't already implied.  Otherwise,
what governs when the initial test going to be done by the CPU?
Note that not all archs do cmpxchg() here, though I don't think that affects
your argument.
