Without a further explanation of this craziness, it's a little hard to 
discuss...

The main reason is this part in ntpd/ntp_loopfilter.c of the ntp package:
        if (pll_nano) {
                ntv.offset = (int32)(clock_offset *
                    1e9 + dtemp);
                ntv.constant = sys_poll;
        } else {
                ntv.offset = (int32)(clock_offset *
                    1e6 + dtemp);
                ntv.constant = sys_poll - 4;
        }
It uses the pll_nano switch to distinguish between the old and new ntp 
model. The kernel now implements the new ntp model, but the actual 
userspace interface hasn't changed yet, so the kernel undoes the 
compensation.
Here is bit more information about where this adjustments comes from:
