For some time now we have been writing user applications that send ATAPI
commands to the IDE bus to initialize and configure our hardware RAID 1
controllers. This has been working well, thanks to Andre's patch that gave
us taskfile access through the ioctl API. We were counting on it to be a
permanent part of the 2.5/2.6 kernel, since there is a lot of hardware in
the field using these apps.
Imagine our surprise when we discovered that taskfile access was being
abandoned completely!
Although we understand that the kernel may need to filter some commands, why
can't applications access at least the Smart commands? Help!
