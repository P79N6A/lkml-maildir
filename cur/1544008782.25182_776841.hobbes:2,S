What about the last hunk from the patch at
http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=122607472721145&w=2
? Can we add this tx_free pointer? Would you like me to submit it as a 
separate patch? I'd like to be able to reuse tx-descriptors in clients, so 
I then have to explicitly release them in the dmaengine device 
(controller) driver.
Thanks
Guennadi
