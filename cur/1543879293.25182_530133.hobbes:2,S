Aarghh ... just the argument I wanted to steer clear of, isn't this?
Continuing, however, we _can_ do a lot of things in userspace, but
still might choose to do them in the kernel, for various reasons in
each case (performance, convenience, application transparency etc
etc). So many things come to mind -- filesystems, readahead, the
cryptoapi itself -- some less controversial, and some more so.
Of course, once an infrastructure is indeed merged into the kernel, it
better already have (or quickly develop) some users for itself. If it
doesn't, it does end up as rot. If it does, that pretty much solves
the maintenance problem there itself.
Getting specific to *this* particular case, I _can_ think of other
users in the kernel that could gladly use general asymmetric crypto
capabilities added to the cryptoapi -- encrypting file systems, module
signing (as of now they've just implemented DSA directly for
themselves, not through the cryptoapi) to name a few.

Well, then *all* the users of the RSA cryptoapi code would end up
duplicating the PKCS padding for themselves! (because if we don't care
about padding in a "low-maintenance-bare-RSA-implementation", then we
might as well not implement any RSA crypto at all :-) Also, padding
schemes are careful cryptographic constructions -- much like ciphers
themselves. Much thought has gone into PKCS#1 over the years (and it's
later revisions). We wouldn't want users to re-invent some kind of
insecure padding for themselves.
The way I think about this is: (1) RSA without PKCS#1 makes no sense,
and (2) PKCS#1 is *defined* only for RSA. Combine (1) and (2), and it
makes *all* sense to encapsulate the two in just one module.
Coming to padding standards, RSA has been around for ~20 years now,
and only 3 PKCS#1 padding schemes were ever defined (at least AFAICR).
That's not something that changes so frequently as to not implement it
in the core RSA code itself, especially when the penalties of not
doing so could be quite embarrassing indeed.

If RSA is slow, then optimizing it to make it fast (and thus have more
impact on relative performance) should make *more* sense, shouldn't
it? That MPI implementation is derived from GPG, which has been around
for a decade now. I'd much rather prefer well-known and
well-understood code that has been used, tested and maintained for a
decade than some recent/unused contraption, thank you.

Hmmm ... and again I'll excuse myself from the debate whether to
*actually* merge MPI and asymmetric crypto capabilities into the
mainline tree or not -- it's all about whether the potential users
named earlier really want to be able to do all that stuff in-kernel or
wouldn't mind writing userspace components for it.
