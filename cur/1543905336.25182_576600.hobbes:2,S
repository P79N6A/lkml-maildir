One possible issue is sequencing, perhaps the stack argument copy
is occuring before the new context is setup properly on sun4c.
Another issue might be the new flush_cache_page() call in this
new code in fs/exec.c, there are now cases where flush_cache_page()
will be called on kernel addresses, and sun4c's implementation might
not like that at all.
