hm, I wonder if that's related.

No longer using tsc, using hpet instead.  Slower.

I think there are acpi fixes in Len's latest tree which will fix this.

I wonder if that was supposed to happen.  It's also happening in 2.6.23-rc3
base.
I don't see anything there which would cause you to lose the clock setting,
but there are obviously a few things going wrong in the time-management
area here.  Please explicity retest this stuff as the code evolves and kepp
us informed of the problems.
Thanks.
