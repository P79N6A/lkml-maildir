Both Trusted Solaris and the SecureWare CMW (HP-UX CMW, Digital MLS+,
SCO CMW) use this type of scheme.
SecureWare names the file privilege sets granted and potential,
as opposed to forced and allowed.  But in general the concepts
are the same.
This kind of setup allows a secure programming method that is called
"privilege bracketing".  In which you drop all effective privileges at
the very beginning of a program, then raise them into the effective
set as needed.  This limits the ability of "shellcode" and sub-processes
to do nasty things with privileges.

The saved set provides privilege sanity when changing effective UID.
