Just in case you don't know it from school, equally essential is UNIX
Internals, ISBN: 0131019082.  It's OS agnostic (though the author likes
Mach a lot), and unlike the above books it covers many features Linux
does not yet have, like priority inheritance.
After all, if you only have a hammer, everything starts to look like a
nail...
