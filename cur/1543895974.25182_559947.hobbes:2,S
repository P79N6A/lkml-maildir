Yep, the device table patch doesn't change any function, so your problem
started from when 965G support patch has been in kernel. 
Carlo, pls try a kernel param of "pci=nommconf" to see if that could
fix your hang. There might be a BIOS bug, as similar issue also happen
like 
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=228683
I think for i965 we could have following patch to fix this, we may
fail if no IGD device got detected.
