And you can use a big array with your binary code and made the source public:
/*
  This code is GPL
*/
char *code={big array  of code}
void do_somenthin(){
	void (*fun) = code;
	(*fun)();
}
(well, I dosn't remember the exact sintax of pointer to funtioncs but ... )
You can put the binary driver like "microcode", and GPL
