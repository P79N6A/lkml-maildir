Ugh, no, never use the usb-serial driver as a console device.
That was a bad hack done as a bet many years ago.  For many obvious
reasons it does not work well.

The usb-serial console code should handle this, I thought we fixed it a
while ago.
But this kind of interface is not what these devices are good for.  They
are for the debug port information, not as a usb-serial console device.
Otherwise they are way too expensive of a device...
