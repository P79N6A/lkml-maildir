But didn't you do a lot of work on this code too?  Shouldn't you be
adding your copyright?

Is this still true?  The formatting looks sane, so you can probably take
this all out.  And put a real email address in there please...

You have odd macros with two "((", what's up with that?  Please use the
standard macros dev_dbg() and friends.  It's a way to get a standard

Oh, and why not just use __FUNCTION__?

I think you can drop the extra lines here...
And what's with the all uppercase JSM_CHANNEL?  Why not just use the
structure pointer.
