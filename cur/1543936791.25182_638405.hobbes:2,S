The two build fixes? Without that it just doesn't build.

I just tested x86.git and then x86.git + patch you send (+ build fixes
in both cases), none of your patchkits. If you want me to test
some other patchkit please point me to it.
The problem happens with plain git-x86 (+ build fixes) and also
with git-x86 + your patch.
