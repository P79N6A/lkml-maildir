Aeh? I can not follow. I feel completely comfortable with the names (strings)
or subdirs, you use. My problem: I have 2 ide-controllers. I would like
to get them as host0 and host1. Boths with the sub-dirs bus0 and bus1.
Reading your answer I though you mean it is fixed due to the pci-id's - but
they do not match ...
And disabling one channel in the bios shouldn't move the controller
from host0 to host1 ... - I do not see the system-behind that ...
Btw. Thanks for DevFS it really ROCKs!! (Except that USBfs exists
and I can not maintain / controll it via the devfsd :-(()
