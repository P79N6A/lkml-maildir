Once you are managing large storage arrays you need a saner naming system.
Not devfs though, although you can build it over devfs just fine - you
end up needing mount by uuid/volume name. Anything else is just plain
horrible to manage updates.
devfs is an extremely clean solution to a problem. Im just not 100% sure
its the right solution or the right problem. Its certainly in the right
ballpark
