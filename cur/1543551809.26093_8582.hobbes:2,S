We do rename structures too, and this would be similiar. I'm more
concerned about binary compability. If anyone uses BLKSSZGET (for
whatever reason) it should not suddenly change the behaviour.
Why should one need version checks? If someone really needs that ioctl, he
has to copy that define, anyway, so his copy will still have the old value
(and behaviour).

But I also want to patch 2.2.17 or earlier kernels, but I don't want a
fdisk that breaks on these kernels.

No, not yet.

No, I didn't see anything else.
