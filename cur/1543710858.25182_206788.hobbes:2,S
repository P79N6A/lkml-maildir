Nope.
I think this feature is very likely to be abused by programmers. They do 
deserve suffering if they choose to shoot at their own feet.
Kernel programmers have to be aware of implementation of this feature if they 
choose to call arbitrary functions. This includes knowing whether interrupts 
are disabled, handling of exceptions in gdb called functions, whether other 
processors run, that breakpoints are  disabled. Given that kgdb is used for 
learning the kernel, such features are best kept aside.
