	I've never heard of a case of PCI-ID collision between two
different manufacturer, so I need to update myself ;-)
	I was already burnt by this mess, as many IrDA users get
confused when ir-usb loads instead of irda-usb, so my experience so
far in handling those case has not been very positive.
	But, I trust you now have things under control ;-)
	Have fun...
	Jean
