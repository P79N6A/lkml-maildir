Hi Rusty-
I was looking into a bug in /proc/net/dev truncated output.
/proc/net/dev lists {if (!buggy)} all loaded network interfaces.
To get a large number of network interfaces, Christian (below)
told me to copy driver/net/dummy.o to several different file names
and then insmod them.  It seems to have worked for him, and it works
that way in 2.4.recent, but it's not working for me.  See error
messages below.
Which way is expected behavior?
What should be the expected behavior?
or am I just seeing bugs (failures) that noone else sees?
It seems like not supporting this is likely to cause some problems.
Thanks,
~Randy
(was: [BUG 2.5.67 (and probably earlier)] /proc/dev/net doesnt show all net devices)

Doesn't work for me.  insmod (from ver. 0.9.11a module-init-tools)
won't load multiple copies of dummy[n].o or dummy[n].ko.
(with dummy already loaded)
For the .o files, it says:
  dummy: no version magic, tainting kernel.
  Error inserting 'dummy1.o': -1 File exists
and for the .ko files, it says:
  Error inserting 'dummy1.ko': -1 File exists
