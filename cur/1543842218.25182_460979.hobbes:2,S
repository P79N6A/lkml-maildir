I figured since you were doing some house-keeping, we might as well clean
up as much as possible.  It's up to you, though.  ;)

It does look non-obvious when reading the code.  However, I'm pretty sure
it's right.  dio->block_in_file is only updated if there is no error
returned from submit_page_section.  As such, it really does reflect how
much work was done before the error, right?  It does seem odd that we do
this math in two separate places, though.
