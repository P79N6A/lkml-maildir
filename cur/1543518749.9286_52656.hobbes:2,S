Hmm .. seems that there is a SMP problem in knfsd,
I can only say that it is very unlikely that my dual pentium
hardware is faulty since this box worked very will as a NFS
server using an old slackware distro with kernel 2.0.33 + userspace NFS.
Tomorrow I will disable knfsd , let's see what happens.
any thoughts ?
Benno.
