That's what I thought I read.  But then my question is:  with on-demand  
paging, is it possible to have two processes partially paged?  Surely, it  
MUST be the case that any processes with overlapping logical address  
spaces must be paged coherently.  So, while on-demand "paging-in" allows  
for partial paging of a process, is it the case that, on a context switch,  
the user-space PTE's are completely erased (so that you get page-faults  
and can then on-demand page them in...)?
