All,
A new version of the 8.x series driver for Linux 2.5.x kernels has
been uploaded to SourceForge:
	
http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-qla2xxx/
In addition to the standard kernel-tree and external build tar-balls,
a patch file is provided to update v8.00.00b1 sources to v8.00.00b2.
Changes include:
 *	- Add support for new 'Hotplug initialization' model. 
 *	- Simplify host template by removing unused callbacks.
 *	- Use scsicam facilities to determine geometry.
 *	- Fix compilation issues for non-ISP23xx builds:
 *	  - Correct register references in qla_dbg.c.
 *	  - Correct Makefile build process.
 *	- Simplify dma_addr_t handling during command queuing given
 *	  new block-layer defined restrictions:
 *	  - Physical addresses not spanning 4GB boundaries.
 *	- Resync with 2.5.69-bk8.
Regards,
Andrew Vasquez
