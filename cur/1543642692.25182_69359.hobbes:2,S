How do you track this? Can you keep a reference count for each
PID and score 1 for each of the above usages (and one for normal
use)? Or do you think it's better to just fall back to the current
system in the non-trivial case?

OK, well whilst you're at it, do you want make the free pid list
per CPU with no locking, and make it even more efficient? ;-) 
We now have plenty of free PIDs to play with, and you could refill
the list with 100 entries or so if you had to fall back to scanning.
Actually, you could do that even if your current proposal doesn't
work out ....

Personally, I think it'd be great ... the current scanning doesn't 
seem like an efficient algorithm at all.
