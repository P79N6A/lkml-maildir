I did wonder about that whih was why I asked the question about the tcp_*mem
settings. I guess that if that is the case either you can increase the tcp_*mem
settings or make the maximum number of blocks merged into a single request
lower. Personally I'd go for the former solution, all you need to do is select
suitable numbers to set for these files (see 
linux/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt for their exact meaning). If
this does turn out to be the problem, then you'll need to make the config
changes on both server and client as they can both send maximum sized requests
(128 (MAX_SEGMENTS) sectors plus the size of the header).
To reduce the request size you can alter MAX_SEGMENTS in blkdev.h but this
isn't really a very good solution as it reduces the ability to merge I/O
for local disks.
Steve.
