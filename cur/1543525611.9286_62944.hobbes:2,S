How can you enumerate all mm_struct's with the new lazy tlb code? Both
ia64 [arch/ia64/mm/tlb.c] and  ppc [arch/ppc/mm/init.c] assume that
	for_each_task(tsk) {
		do_something(tsk->mm);
	}
will reach all mm_structs, but if a thread is running in temporary lazy
tlb mode {start,end}_lazy_tlb(), then this fails.
Is there another way to enumerate all mm_structs, or should I add a new
double linked list?
