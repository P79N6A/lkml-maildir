Hm, but the code is now bigger.

Why are you not using the current cpu struct devices in the system?
Don't roll your own logic for this with "raw" kobjects please.

Don't use request_firmware, use request_firmware_nowait() instead.  That
way you never stall.  You only want to update the firmware when
userspace tells you to, not for every boot like I think this will do.
