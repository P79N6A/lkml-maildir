This isn't just for hotplug by any means. Andy wrote it to get rid of a whole
bunch of different problems, roughly based on some previous work by Dan Phillips
and Dave McCracken (I've added a cc to the actual authors of these patches). 
This is the major part of what used to be called CONFIG_NONLINEAR, which we 
discussed at last year's kernel summit, and people were pretty enthusiastic 
about.

Not really - it cleans up the current mess where discontigmem means, and
is used for, two distinct things: 1. the memory is significantly non-contig
in the physical layout. 2. NUMA support.
It also allows us to support discontiguous memory *within* a NUMA node, which
is important for some systems - we can scrap the added complexity of ia64s
vmemmap stuff, for instance. 
Whatever your opinions are on mem hotplug, I think we want CONFIG_SPARSEMEM
to clean up the existing mess of discontig - with or without hotplug. I've 
wanted this for a very long time, and was dicussing it with Andy at OLS last 
year; he came up with a much better, cleaner way to implement it than I had.
It also makes a lot of sense as a foundation for hotplug, which multiple 
people seem to want for virtualization stuff.
Anyway, that's what I want it for ;-)

Andy, can you explain that further? Maybe also worth checking these are the
correct version of your patches.
