OK... I see what's happening.  When the VIA VT6212 sees the "inactivate"
bit set, it will START the split transaction, but it doesn't finish it.
When I set the "I" bit--even if I set it like 50 uframes before the
transaction should start--the controller will set bit 1
(splitXstate--this means it's started the transaction) and clear bit 7
(active bit) in the token, when it comes time for the transaction to be
run.
This is a violation of EHCI 1.0 spec section 4.12.2.5, second bullet:
"If the Active bit is a one and the SplitXState is DoStart (regardless
of the value of S-mask), the host
controller will simply set Active bit to a zero... the host controller
must not issue the start-split bus transaction."
With an analyzer, I've observed that the controller is indeed issuing
"start split" without issuing "complete split", and I'm losing
keystrokes if I type when this is happening, as expected.
So... I still think blacklisting the VIA controllers from this CPU
frequency stuff is the best option.  It is unlikely that any real issues
will be seen during CPU frequency transitions with these controllers
anyway, because they claim to cache 8 uframes of the periodic schedule.
