Subject: [patch] x86: Fix dev_to_node  for x86 and x86_64

Hi Andrew,
dev_to_node() does not work as expected on x86 and x86_64 as pointed out
earlier here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/7/10
Following patch fixes it, please apply.  (Note: The fix depends on support
for PCI domains for x86/x86_64)
Thanks,
Kiran
dev_to_node does not work as expected on x86_64 (and i386).  This is because
node value returned by pcibus_to_node is initialized after a struct device
is created with current x86_64 code.
We need the node value initialized before the call to pci_scan_bus_parented,
as the generic devices are allocated and initialized
off pci_scan_child_bus, which gets called from pci_scan_bus_parented
The following patch does that using "pci_sysdata" introduced by the PCI
domain patches in -mm.
