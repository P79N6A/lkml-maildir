The shiny userspace firmware loading causes problems since it exists,
every second box has problems with it, in all sorts of situations. If
people are still sold to the idea of userspace firmware loading, why
don't we keep the data in the driver, instead of immediately
discarding it after the first upload? Not to waste a few hundred
kilobytes? That doesn't sound like a convincing deal, after all the
years people try to work around the issues it causes.
