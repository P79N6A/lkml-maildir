Not entirely infrequently. Which is why it really doesn't seem like
it could be useful from a security point of view without a *huge*
amount of work and complexity... and even from a guaranteed-service
point of view, it still seems (to me) like a pretty big and complex
problem.
As a check box for marketing it sounds pretty cool though, I admit ;)
