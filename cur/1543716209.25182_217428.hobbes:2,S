No, not if you want your procps to work anyway.
If your TTY is pts/256 or above, you'll need
procps-3.2.0 or above to see it and select it.
If you think "ps s" shouldn't be missing a few
columns, procps-3.1.6 or above is needed.
If you want to view threads, procps-3.1.14 or
above is needed.
If you want to run SE Linux, procps-3.1.15 or
above is needed.
------------- partial list of improvements --------------
* ps fully supports thread display (H, -L, m, -m, and -T)
* ps can display NSA SELinux security contexts
* top can show CPU usage for IO-wait, IRQ, and softirq
* can set $PS_FORMAT to choose your own default ps format
* better width control ("ps -o pid,wchan:42,args")
* width of ps PID column adjusts to your system
* vmstat lets you choose units you like: 1000, 1024, 1000000...
* top can sort by any column (old sort keys available too)
* top can select a single user to display
* top can be put in multi-window mode and/or color mode
* vmstat has the -s option, as found on UNIX and BSD systems
* vmstat has the -f option, as found on UNIX and BSD systems
* watch doesn't eat the first blank line by mistake
* vmstat uses a fast O(1) algorithm on 2.5.xx kernels
* pmap command is SunOS-compatible
* vmstat shows IO-wait time
* pgrep and pkill can find the oldest matching process
* sysctl handles the Linux 2.5.xx VLAN interfaces
* ps has a new "-F" format (very nice, like DYNIX/ptx has)
* ps with proper BSD process selection
* better handling of very long uptimes
