You think the kernel decodes the 1bit per 16 bytes into a "dcim"
directory? (I filtered out both the lines with 16 0xff bytes as well
as those with 16 0x00 bytes. That leaves one bit per 16 bytes that I
didn't show in that Email)
Feel free to tell me what I'm doing wrong.... I'd like to know. I
could hack the kernel to hexdump the blocks it gets from the disk. I
know I can. I was hoping the linux-kernel crew would be able to tell
me something obvious I was missing or that we're on to something
odd...)
