No. The APIC retries the stuff that go wrong, so all
you get is a very slight performance degradation.
Nothing to worry about unless it happens hundreds of
times per second, or require extreme latency
on _every_ interrupt.

Almost all bp6 owner get this when they run a kernel that
report APIC trouble.  You can improve the situation by:
* not overclocking
* use a really good power supply, a bp6 draws more current
  than a single-cpu board.  One with lots of watts are
  probably good.  Or look for "athlon approved", athlons
  require good power too.
* extra cooling of the board.  Replace that little green
  heatsink with a fan, and use thermal grease.  A
  486 fan or 40mm fan is suposed to fit perfectly.  
  Make sure there is good  airflow throgh the case, and
  good circulation over the entire board.

This isn't something you need to worry about - it is
more a "I want a clean logfile" issue.
