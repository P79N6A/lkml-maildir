You cannot and should not mix XFree86 servers (except the frame buffer
console server) with the kernel frame buffer driver. Period.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes strange things occur.
It is not a supported combination. Both X and the kernel wish to be the sole
owner of the video driver unless you use the X fbcon server
