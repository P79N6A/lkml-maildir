Will it still be done, if we put it on the "export-objs" list?
Putting an explicit "EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo)" only encourages people
not to look what they can prepend with "static". Everything not
static is the C-definition of "exporting".
EXPORT_SYMBOL is nice, if you have modules consisting of multiple
objects, that need to share variables/functions but should not be
needed, if the module-author knows sth. about proper design.
