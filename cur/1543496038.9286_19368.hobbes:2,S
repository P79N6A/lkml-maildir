Well, we have (or had until recently) work being done on three different
kernel trees:
2.0.37 (Thanks, Alan !)
2.2.x (Up to 2.2.9 now ?)
and
2.3.x
All at the same time, I think.  (And this is just the 'mainline' kernel
trees.)
Now for the questions:
1.) Was a final 2.0.37 ever released (Last I checked we were up to ac-12,
    I think).
2.) For the time in the future when I want to go to the 2.2 kernel (It
    seems, from reading this list, to have yet a few bugs^H^H^H^H....errrr
    'unresolved features') is there a "victims list" of things that need
    to be replaced/removed/upgraded in order to go from 2.0.37 to the
    latest 2.2.x kernel ??
Thanks,
Gary Anderson
