I have a suggestion.  If you're compressing only for the sake of 
obfuscation, then don't really try to save any space.  Use a fast 
compression algorithm which doesn't necessarily do a great job.
When you're going to write, compress the block.  If it gets smaller, 
fine.  Store it in the same space it would have required even if it were 
uncompressed.  If the block gets bigger, then store it uncompressed. 
Whether or not the block could be compressed would be stored in metadata 
(in the inode, I guess).
