Hmm, actually, no. On UP, yes. But on SMP, you might tasklet_kill
while the tasklet is running, but before it has had a chance to
tasklet_schedule itself. tasklet_schedule will have no effect in
this case.
Alexey, if my observation is correct, the property

does not hold if using tasklet_kill on SMP.
