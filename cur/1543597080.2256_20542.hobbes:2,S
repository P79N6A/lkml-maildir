This topic comes up once a twice a year.
Usually this topic comes to a grinding halt when someone points out
that drivers can be created modular. They can be loaded and unloaded
without rebooting Linux. One project used that technique to
load/unload different schedulers. While this satisfies only part of
the need, it is usually enough to satisfy the tinker-er.
A more recent development is UML - User Mode Linux - where you can run
a nearly complete Linux image in user mode. That way you can fiddle
with file systems to your hearts content without rebooting the main
system. I suspect that will satisfy others.
