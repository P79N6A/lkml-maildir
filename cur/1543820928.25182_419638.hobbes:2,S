yes. I heard an admin has to re-run kexec_load.

It reads physical memory list from /proc/iomem now.
The physical memory list is read and saved at kdump kernel loading time
instead of crashing time.

A user program has to make memory section online from sysfs , anyway.
The hotplug script for memory hotplug will run at memory hotplug event 
from ACPI. If a user uses /probe interface (powerpc, x86_64),
he knows what he does. 
hot-add -> online memory -> kexec_load() is a scenario I think of.
