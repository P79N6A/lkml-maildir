The new udev is nice, and it 'works', but Im still having two problems:
    (1) Although the messages file shows that it is reading my 
        /etc/udev/namedev.config file, the entries are being ignored.
        Ive tried both:
	    LABEL, BUS="usb", serial="0B0201420527B284", NAME="usb_disk"
        and
            LABEL, BUS="usb", vendor="DMI", NAME="usb_disk"
        and all I get are /udev/ sda, sdb, sdc, sdd, ... as I plug and unplug.
    (2) This worked in -0.2, but not -0.3:  When a device is created in
        /udev, I now get just /udev/sda .  Previously (0.2) I got both
        sda and sda1 .  Needless to say, a mount attempt on /udev/sda1
        now fails.  [[ and if I tell it NAME="usb_disk" what should I
        expect for the name of the first partition???
Am I missing something???
