Subject: pivot_root doesn't work for me in 2.6.14-rc3

I've found a problem with pivot_root that worked fine in 2.6.13.3, but
fails for me, starting in 2.6.14-rc3  (haven't tried rc1 or rc2).
This is for LTSP.org (Linux Terminal Server Project) thin clients.
In our initramfs, we have a '/init' script that creates a mountpoint for
a 2nd ramfs, and i'm trying to pivot_root to that mount point.
I'm getting:
   pivot_root: Invalid Argument
This worked perfectly in 2.6.13.3, so I looked at the 2.6.14-rc3 patch,
and I found the code in fs/namespace.c that is causing it to fail for
me:

        if (new_nd.mnt->mnt_root != new_nd.dentry)
                goto out2; /* not a mountpoint */

+               goto out2; /* not attached */
        tmp = old_nd.mnt; /* make sure we can reach put_old from
new_root */
        spin_lock(&vfsmount_lock);
        if (tmp != new_nd.mnt) {
The first of the 2 new tests are causing the pivot_root to fail for me.
If I comment out those lines, it works again.
I'm thinking that somebody put those lines there for a reason, so
there's possibly something wrong with the way i've been doing this for a
long time, and the tightening of the code has uncovered my problem.
I'll explain how we use the initramfs/nfsroot:
  1) kernel boots, mounts initramfs
  2) /init creates and mouts a ramfs on /newroot
  3) create /newroot/nfsroot mountpoint
  4) nfsmount /opt/ltsp/i386 from the server on /newroot/nfsroot
  5) create a bunch of symlinks to things we need on the nfs filesystem
     such as bin, etc, lib, sbin, usr
  6) create a bunch of ram-based directories in /newroot, such as
     tmp, dev, oldroot, proc and sys
  7) cd /newroot; pivot_root . oldroot
  8) mount /sys and /proc, start udev
  9) exec /sbin/init
We don't do the pivot_root directly to the nfs-mounted filesystem,
because then EVERY file access we do causes NFS traffic.

Somebody recently told me that pivot_root has been put in the 'evil way
to do things' category, and that there was a new way, but he couldn't
remember what that was.
So, if anybody knows the new way, i'd appreciate hearing about it.
Thanks,
Jim McQuillan
