Even with 50% of memory in pagetables, I wouldn't be happy.
If I fork out the money for a machine with 16 GB of RAM, I'd
expect the thing to be able to at least cache 12 GB of my
database.  Wasting all of memory in page tables just isn't
allright ;)
Gerrit told me some people within IBM are working on large
page support for shared memory segments and mmap()d areas,
I hope it'll be good enough to get accepted into 2.5 soon...

Rik
