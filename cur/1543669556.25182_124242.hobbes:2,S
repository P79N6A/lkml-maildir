I am all for more general solution (dynamic assignment), if I can get
(1) backward compatibility with device nodes
(2) device nodes get updated automagically whenever my
<major,minor> changes. (may be due to insmod/rmmod, reboot etc..)
I can't see (2) happening easily. I know that Greg KH is working on
udev (/dev/ memory filesystem). Once that happens, we have to change
drivers/subsystems (we need) to make dynamic allocation. All of this Is 
going to happen for 2.6 ?
Thats why, I am trying to come out with half-cooked workable solution for 2.6. 
Thanks,
Badari
