Yes, but ext2 has a lot of machinery associated with it to prevent this. It
is _far_ easier to delete/overwrite/mangle a file than to screw up a
filesystem.

Some way to make /dev/usb25 appear out of nothing won't give the same
newbie any clue about how to handle it either.
BTW, Linux has worked for newbies for quite some time. Sure, they might get
