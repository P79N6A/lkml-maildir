the "max delay" measurement isn't a reflection of the runtime activity
of jackd. its simply a measurement of the delay between when jackd
expected to be next woken from poll and when it actually was.
as you noted, jackd generally goes back to sleep in poll typically a
long time before the next interrupt is expected. hence any delay in
the wakeup is between the interrupt handler and the scheduler getting
jackd's main thread back on the processor. i think.
