I'll make patches for 2.5 to bring the low-level driver cleanups back.
Not just piix.c - also aec62xx.c and amd74xx.c - the last one was in 2.5
for a LONG time already and I'm not particularly happy it got lost.
If desirable (What's your opinion, Alan?) I can make equivalent patches
for 2.4 as well.
