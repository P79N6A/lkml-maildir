Yes, it works with sky2. Yes, the USB device that is reported to fail
by PM_TRACE shares the interrupt with eth0, which is sk98lin (see my
original posting in this thread).

I don't know, all I have is the PM_TRACE output.
Meanwhile, tried to remove uhci_hcd before suspend, and wakeup works
then. However, my DVB-T box is dead after resume (reloading the driver
doesn't work, only unplug/replug the device helps). It works with
suspend to disk, though.
