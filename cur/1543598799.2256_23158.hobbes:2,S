I'm currently writing a stack profiler as my diploma thesis. It should give
a statistic how long a packet takes from one part of the network stack to
the other. So I have to watch the sk_buffs travelling through the kernel
and I need badly to know when they are allocated :) And, on top, the
deadline is in one week, and there are really strange things going on ;)

I have done some bit more testing yesterday, and the problem occurs in
either sending and receiving way, on two different ethernet drivers
