Hardly.  What it does, apparently, is extra page_cache_release().

Analysis above is BS.
	a) page with non-NULL ->mapping == page in cache.  Code that adds
page to page cache grabs a reference before putting it on the lists.
	b) code that evicts page from cache drops a reference after getting
the sucker off lists.
	c) final page_cache_release() while page is still in cache is,
indeed, a bug.  Of memory-corrupting variety.
	d) ->readpage() has no fscking business playing with any of the above.
	e) while we are at it, -EFAULT is a hell of a strange error for
->readpage(), but that's a separate story.
Check for unbalanced page_cache_release() in their code.

See above.  Anything beyond that requires
	1) access to their code
	2) good supply of industrial-strength barf-bags to deal with
inevitable consequences of (1).
