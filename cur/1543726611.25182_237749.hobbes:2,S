Indeed, I remember having read parts of it several times because it was
very clean. I agree that the first half of the function does the same
thing as the initialization code. What is more of a problem is the second
half which resets the card, because inserting resets in the tulip driver
is not trivial (at least to me). But perhaps it would be acceptable to
only implement the dev->mtu change when the device is not up.

It's for the tulip driver. Now, you're right, it doesn't use dev->mtu at
all (just noticed now) ! So this is fairly simpler, since I then assume
that the driver will work up to PKT_BUF_SZ - 14 or 18.
Ok, I have the hardware, you've convinced me. I'll try it.
Cheers,
Willy
