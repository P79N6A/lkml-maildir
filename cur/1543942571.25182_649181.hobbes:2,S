In theory, yes, and should be true in practice before it hits swap.
But I think you'll find our swap handling is too primitive for tmpfs
to perform well once we hit swap.  Most filesystems pay considerable
attention to good performance within their constraints of correctness.
Whereas with tmpfs we've just never worried about the performance once
swapping.  It's used so you don't lose your data, but if you're really
expecting to be going to disk very much, better start with a filesystem
really designed for that.
