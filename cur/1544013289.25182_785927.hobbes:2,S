It may well be true that most embedded people cross-build kernels and
use native perl on a fat build box, but there are plenty of situations
where being able to build kernels without perl is useful. Given the
simplicitly of these patches I can't see any reason not to put them
in, and appreciate Rob's work on this.
And if cross-building perl is really easy, as some in this thread
claim, can someone fix the Debian packages to do it, because that
would be really useful (it appears to be of similar complexity to
cross-building gcc, requiring a 2-stage self-referential build).
