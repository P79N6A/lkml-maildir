The problem here is that we've explicitly forced the
PAGE_foo type to unsigned long.
If we instead take the "UL" out of PAGE_SIZE altogether,
the compiler can then promote the type of PAGE_SIZE and PAGE_MASK
to the widest type being used in the expression (ie: long long)
and everything should work.
Which seems to be a much cleaner solution, if it works.
Will it work?
