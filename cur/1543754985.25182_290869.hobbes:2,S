it can be bad for the idle task to hold the BKL and to have preemption
enabled - in such a situation the scheduler will get confused if an
interrupt triggers a forced preemption in that small window. But it's
not necessary to keep IRQs disabled after the BKL has been dropped. In
fact i think IRQ-disabling doesnt have to be done at all, the patch
below ought to solve this scenario equally well, and should solve the
PPC side-effects too.
Tested ontop of 2.6.11-rc2 on x86 PREEMPT+SMP and PREEMPT+!SMP (which
IIRC were the config variants that triggered the original problem), on
an SMP and on a UP system.
