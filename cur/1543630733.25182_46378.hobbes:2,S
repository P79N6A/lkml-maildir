That's because without root, the application cannot raise its
scheuling priority and it cannot change to realtime policy.
So the problem would appear to be that your networking *requires*
ksoftirqd services to function.  Either:
1) The driver is bust - its hard_start_xmit() function is failing
   frequently, and relying on ksoftirqd to get things done (I think;
   it's been a while).  Or
2) Something is wrong with the ksoftirqd design.  Or
3) Red Hat fiddled with ksoftirqd and broke it.
I'd be inclined to suspect 1).

That's a shame.
