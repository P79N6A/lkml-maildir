Perhaps for the same reason that these other in-tree filesystems are
sensitive to the character encoding:
   Joliet (ISO-9660 extension), FAT/VFAT, NTFS, BeFS, SMBFS, CIFS.
Those filesystems will also fail, or give unexpected behaviour (such
as bytes being changed to '?'), if you pass them names which are not
in the appropriate encoding.
