If Cisco can't do a balanced hash, that doesn't mean the idea is bad,
it just means they implemented it poorly.  I would think that
something as simple as: src_ip_port % num_devices would give a
fairly even spread.  I'm sure you could get fancier and take other
fields (dst_ip_port) into account in your hash.
