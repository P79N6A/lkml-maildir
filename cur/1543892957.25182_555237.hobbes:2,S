Subject: [GIT PATCH] Driver core fixes for 2.6.22-rc4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/8/476

Here are some driver core fixes for 2.6.22-rc4
They contain:
	- documentation update
	- email fixes for a deceased maintainer
	- fixes for PHYSDEV for older class_devices that broke some
	  userspace tools unnecessarily
	- printk levels for kobjects.
	- fix compiler warning that like 10 people have emailed me
	  patches for.
All of these have been in the -mm tree for a number of weeks.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
