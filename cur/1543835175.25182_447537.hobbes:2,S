Hello,
in general the policy for Linux is that if adding support for a new
device is only minor changes to an existing driver, it is better to
update this existing driver with those changes. The reason for that is
that this makes it possible to share bugfixes and testing between both
devices. Now there is a point where it no longer makes sense to share,
for example when the devices are really very, very different.
