Mr. Miller,
	Ack. When Linus returns, I'm sure he'll give us all very good reasons 
why he thought it needed to be changed.
	BTW, what is your opinion on the various ways I suggested to satisfy 
people over the min()/max() issue? Mr. LaHaise nearly threw up when I suggested 
using #ifdef, so we can safely scratch that one ;-). What do you think, sir?
Brad
