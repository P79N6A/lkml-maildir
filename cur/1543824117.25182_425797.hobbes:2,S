Interesting info. I agree that LZMA is not a replacement for gzip/zlib, 
because gzip is extremely size/time efficient.
However, as noted in another thread, it is almost certainly a viable 
replacement for bzip2, since people that use bzip2 are generally interested 
in a size optimisation, not a compression speed one, and even if compression 
speed is relevant, LZMA's options scale to be approximately as good (or as 
bad??) as bzip2.
This is all fairly academic. I think the issue still boils down to widespread 
adoption; bzip2 took a while to get off the ground, people don't like messing 
with new formats, and distributors have to pick up the tools.
I think kernel.org switching formats would be one of the last things that 
could, or indeed should, happen.
