Define current?
All you guys are just going on and on about multiple heads, but I have a
question too:
It's possible to not only have more than 1 monitor, but also more than one
keyboard (PS/2 and USB for example). Suppose you have 2 keyboards and two
monitors. Now how do you define current?
Or am I just completely missing the point here?
