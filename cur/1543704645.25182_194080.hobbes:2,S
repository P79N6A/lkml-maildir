Actually, io-wait is an indication that the CPU is idle with io
outstanding, and doesn't eat the machine any more than idle time. It is
an indication that the io is not keeping up, of course.
The fact that sending /dev/zero is fast sort of eliminates the reported
problems with NFS and setting the read/write size to 8k on the client.
Just for grins, hopefully you have followed the "NFS is slow" thread,
but I saw people having the issue with 2.6.0, so that's not likely to be
be involved.
I have some preliminary numbers which indicate 2.6.2-rc2 is faster at
some disk operations than 2.6.1, but since that's one benchmark on one
machine all I can say is that if you want to move forward, that kernel
is working well for me. Of course if there's nothing in 2.6.1 you
really want or need, falling back is a sure cure.
