It sounds rather strange that this particular patch should introduce
an EIO, but here it is (fresh from BitKeeper)

# [PATCH] Workaround NFS hangs introduced in 2.4.20-pre
# 
# Alan,
# 
# Does the following patch make any difference to the hangs?
# 
# It reverts one effect of my changes, and ensures that requests get resent
# immediately after the timeout, even if doing so would violate the current
# congestion window size.
# Doing this ensures that we keep probing the `connection' to the server
# rather than just waiting for the entire window to time out. The latter
# can be very expensive due to the exponential backoff rule...
# 
# Cheers,
#   Trond
