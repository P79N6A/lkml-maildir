Andi,
Sorry to have taken so long to take another step with this problem.   
Once my customers had a work-around, other priorities crowded out  
this project.  Today Chuck and I did a little more work.  We'd heard  
that a more recent kernel alleged to fix this stuff.  Doing some  
digging, we came across this:

commit 49d26b6eaa8e970c8cf6e299e6ccba2474191bf5
Author: Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jeremy@goop.org>

     [PATCH] i386: Update sys_vm86 to cope with changed pt_regs and % 
gs usage
     sys_vm86 uses a struct kernel_vm86_regs, which is identical to  
pt_regs, but
     adds an extra space for all the segment registers.	Previously  
this structure
     was completely independent, so changes in pt_regs had to be  
reflected in
     kernel_vm86_regs.  This changes just embeds pt_regs in  
kernel_vm86_regs, and
     makes the appropriate changes to vm86.c to deal with the new  
naming.
     Also, since %gs is dealt with differently in the kernel, this  
change adjusts
     vm86.c to reflect this.
     While making these changes, I also cleaned up some frankly  
bizarre code which
     was added when auditing was added to sys_vm86.

Chuck and I took a stab at extracting what we thought was the  
relevant change to the audit_syscall_exit code, but we must have  
gotten it wrong.  The EDID transfer always comes up zeros with our  
extract of  Fitzhardinge's patch.

At this point Chuck and I are trying to decide what will get us the  
best testing with the least effort.  (We keep planning to test with a  
stock kernel, but last time that was on our TODO list, the project  
languished for a month.)
Do you have a specific stock kernel revision to recommend we try on  
our test system currently running Red Hat's 2.6.18?  Are we right to  
presume it would be 2.6.18-0 to demonstrate failure and 2.6.20.0 to  
attempt to demonstrate success?
Are you the Andi Kleen who signed off on Fitzhardinge's patch, and if  
so do you have some insight for Chuck and I about what pieces are  
required to test and see if the bug really got fixed with his cleanup?
I'd feel a lot more confident we were on the right track if I could  
just correctly patch Fitzhardinge's cleanup into the test setup I  
have now.
