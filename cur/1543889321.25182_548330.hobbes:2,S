Is this addition to the master Makefile really necessary? We're just
setting up a source file link here ... is this something temporary that
you're proposing that'll last only till this gets tested or do you want
this kind of special-casing for lzo1x here permanently?

Just defining and exporting LZO1X_WORKMEM_SIZE may not be enough
to guarantee that users _will_ pass in workmem of size exactly that much.
If this workmem is really merely a temp buffer required by lzo1x_compress(),
I'd suggest you rename lzo1x_compress() in lzo1x_compress.c to
__lzo1x_compress(), and implement a lzo1x_compress() wrapper for the
user that handles the allocation (and subsequent free'ing) of this temp
buffer itself.
[ I vaguely remember discussing something of this sort with Richard
when he had submitted his patchset too, perhaps you can look into
his implementation to see how he's managing this ... ]

Whoa! "your application" here is _kernel code_ and not a userspace
program ... "crashing" it is something we could do without :-)

I just read the follow-ups to this, so perhaps we /can/ use the unsafe
versions in certain situations. But I agree with Michael's suggestion
to rename _safe to decompress and decompress to _unsafe ...

... ah, so that's why the master Makefile changes.
Hmmm, perhaps you could extract the common stuff between the
_safe and _unsafe versions out into a separate function and then
reuse it from _safe and _unsafe wrappers? In any case, this kind
of Makefile jugglery (even in the master Makefile) just to avoid the
above doesn't seem quite right ...

Ok, so this is all there is between _safe and _unsafe, it seems ...

... ugh. Yes, extracting the common stuff between the _safe and _unsafe
variants in a common low-level __lzo1x_decompress kind of function
definitely looks doable. The low-level function could simply take an extra
argument (say, set by the _safe and _unsafe wrappers) that tells it
whether it is being called as safe or unsafe ... helps us get rid of the
disruptions to all the Makefiles above and these #ifdef's ugliness ...
BTW, it'd be really cool if Richard and yourself could get together and
pool your energies / efforts to develop a common / same patchset for this.
(I wonder how different your implementations are, actually, and if there
are any significant performance disparities, especially.) I really like your
work, as it clears up the major gripe I had with Richard's patchset -- the
ugliness (and monstrosity) of it. But he's also worked up the glue code for
cryptoapi / jffs2 etc for this, so no point duplicating his efforts.
