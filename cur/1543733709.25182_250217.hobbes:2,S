Sure, but that's not the level we're talking about.  The function we talk
about compare to the vfs_* routines (when looking at the arches with
i386-style generic irq code)(

I never wanted to exclude individual functions.  But when you look at
arch/*/kernel/irq.c I don't see a reason for doing it at all.  It makes
