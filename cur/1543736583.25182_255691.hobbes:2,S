Tiny in that at most you can only pull out 256bits of entropy from one pool,
you are correct.  SHA-256 buffers 64 bytes at time.  The transform requires
512 bytes for its mixing.  The mixing of the 512 byte W[] array is done
serially.
random_state->pool is POOLBYTES in size.  Which is poolwords*4, which is
DEFAULT'd to 512 bytes.  The "5 tap" LFSR reaches all over that 512byte
memory for its mixing.
If page sizes get big enough and we page-align the pool[] member, the
standard RNG will get faster.
