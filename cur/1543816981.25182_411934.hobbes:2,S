I reverted this fix in GNU make 3.81rc2 (available for a bit over a week
now).  3.81 final will ship with the old, buggy behavior instead of the
fixed behavior.
Immediately post-3.81 I'll re-introduce the GNU make fix.
Note that this only impacts people who build the kernel multiple times
without cleaning the tree.  While this is very common with newer
versions of the kernel (for developers) it's probably less common with
older versions, and many of those (distro-based) can apply this kbuild
patch with the rest of their distro-specific patches.
On the gripping hand, it's quite possible to provide a significantly
smaller, targeted patch that fixes just the most egregious problem with
only two lines changed, if the -stable team was interested in that
instead.
