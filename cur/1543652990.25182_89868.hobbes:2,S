I never had good luck, especially under heavy load, until I took out my IBM
drives.  I haven't had any problems with Redhat kernels (and before that
stock 2.4.17) with my Western Digital.

Hello,
> I am using an IBM-DTLA-307030 with HPT366
I am also using an IBM disk (can't rember the model number of hand but
it's a 45GB) with an Abit BP6.

It seemed to work for a while but then things went screwy and I kept
getting I/O errors all the time which needed a hard reset - could't even
shut down.
I also noticed things like this in the log:
Nov 14 23:26:40 buzz kernel: hda: status error:
status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
Nov 14 23:26:40 buzz kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Nov 14 23:28:47 buzz kernel: hda: status error:
status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
Nov 14 23:28:47 buzz kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Nov 14 23:29:00 buzz kernel: APIC error on CPU0: 02(02)
Is this anything like you got?
I'll try to drop it in the bios tonight (it is my boot drive). Are you
using hdparm commands at all or just setting the bios to udma3?

I am not sure I did this but I'll check. Maybe it's just working as a
normal ide interface or something?
Thanks!
Bye for Now,
Ian
