i've done this yesterday and there were a couple of errors (i rebuilt the
tree and tried to rebuild the sb). Due to an error at rebuilding the super
block, I reinstalled my linux system ( i'm not sure if this is related to my
actual kernel, btw. there were some null - files on the fs )
I havn't experienced any errors since then ...
thx,
-Andreas
