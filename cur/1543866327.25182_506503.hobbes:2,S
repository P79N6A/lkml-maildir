true, and i wont argue that point too much other than to say it's nice that 
the kernel provides it so as to reduce code duplication in the world
in more realistic terms, not exporting the ufs_fs.h header prevents any sort 
of raw filesystem checkers which would be running in userspace, but then 
again i cant quote any such packages that actually exist ;)
in the end, it doesnt really matter to me right now one way or the other as 
the silo guys do include some ufs code to handle the case where it is being 
built by a non-linux toolchain
