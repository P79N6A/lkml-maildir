Merging into the upstream kernel is not necessary for exposure.
Historically, saying "no" to a single vendor pushing really hard -- as 
you are doing -- has resulted in a superior solution.

So far, this is an Adaptec-only solution.
It does an end run around 90% of the SCSI core.  You might as well make 
it a block driver, if you're going to do that.
