The network driver should provide the capability to add new devices.
Most drivers currently have the capability to do N devices, where N is
some constant set at compile time.  Typically you use ifconfig, a
special-purpose userland program, or sometimes even sysctls to configure
additional net devices.
It's certainly possible to modify the driver to create additional
network interfaces on the fly, but a lot of drivers are not coded to do
that at present.
