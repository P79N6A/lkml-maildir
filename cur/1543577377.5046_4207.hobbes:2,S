Yes, you have to make sure that you never call a sleeping lock
while holding a spinlock.  And you can't call a sleeping lock from
interrupt handlers in the current model.  But this is easy to avoid.

Experience has shown that adaptive spinlocks are not worth the extra
overhead (if you mean the type that spin for a short time
and then decide to sleep).  It is better to use spin_lock_irqsave()
(which, by definition, disables kernel preemption without the need
to set a no-preempt flag) to protect regions where the lock is held
for a maximum of around 100us, and to use a sleeping mutex lock for
longer regions.  This is what I'm working towards.
