No, it's right just the way it is.  The internal Adaptec aic7xxx part name
does not always correspond directly to the announced/released product name.

Yes, that one's a typo.

I'm not very concerned with these items.  Most of the info in that file is for
my use (the transinfo is not intended to be normal person interpretable at
all, so I couldn't care less about it and readability, I'm concerned about
getting the info I need about SEEPROM configs out of it).  Some of the
rewordings could be applied, and maybe I will put them in my next release, but
it certainly isn't a high priority for me.
