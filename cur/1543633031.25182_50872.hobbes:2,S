It specified that there would be no valid assumptions on the
order of devices woken up. Thus the devices that would be paged
to may still be sleaping. Indeed this situation will always arise
if you have more than one device that may be swapped to
or by (storage, network, bluetooth, ...)
So only GFP_NOIO until every every is awake.
