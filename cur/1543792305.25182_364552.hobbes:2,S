Hi all
It looks like there's no possibility atm to inject block requests from 
user space directly into device's queues? There's an cdrom ioctl, maybe 
scsi, but nothing generic for arbitrary request queue. Or have I missed 
something?
If such a possibility would be considered meaningful, given a general 
dislike to ioctl's, would it be a right idea to implement it as a 
filesystem with an inode for each disk / cdrom / loop / tape / ...?
Thanks
Guennadi
