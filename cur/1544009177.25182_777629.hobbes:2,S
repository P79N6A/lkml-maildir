Its a real pain in the ass with dynamic buffer objects, we don't want userspace
to care where they are located, the kernel migrates them in/out of
video memory, GART, local RAM etc.
However I suspect I just need on these platforms to ban any CPU
accesses to pixmaps in VRAM. However
sw fallbacks to the front buffer will always need these accesses.
Its going to be a real pain getting any traction this stuff upstream
(X.org/Mesa) where the world is x86 and maybe the odd powerpc, having
to do special accessors for shithouse hw is never going to be fun.
Maybe I should start libshithouse to encapsulate the problem, I'll
think about it some more.
