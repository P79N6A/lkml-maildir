Please don't break existing implementations. Some old hardware used in
the amateur radio world doesn't even accept an mtu longer than 256(*),
and the resulting packets will be silently chopped at the end. 
If you want to drop mtu lower than 512, please at least add a
CONFIG_I_NEED_A_GODDAMN_SMALL_MTU as an option.

(*) Kantronics TNCs are an example.
