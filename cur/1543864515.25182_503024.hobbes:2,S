Actually, perhaps we should track these more closely.  At the moment we
have mini summits in
Networking
Wireless
Filesystems
Storage
Power Management
And probably several others I can't remember.  Right at the moment, the
organisation and funding for all of these is completely ad-hoc, so if
mini summits are the way to go, it would certainly be better to move
them on to a more templated basis (so anyone wishing to organise one
would know whom to go to for these things).
