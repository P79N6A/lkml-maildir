In fact, it is a new motherboard we're testing, and with the oldest version of
the kernel I have, 2.4.18, I have also the problem.

With SMP disabled, I have no problem with any kernel. So it must be in the APIC
init, I think.
I don't know how the patch works around this problem, but it's a workaround. I
can test other kernels to find a "better" patch to find and fix this problem,
and have a stable 2.4.24 that works with this hardware.
If you can suggest other things to test or to identify the problem, I can do it.
Thanks
Miro
