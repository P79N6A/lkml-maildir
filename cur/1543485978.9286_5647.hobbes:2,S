	Yes, Gigabyte provides an utility to set-up the part in the hard
disk, but this is not the point, since the problem is _halting_ the
system, not _suspending_ it. The question is that Windoze APM driver can
cope with this BIOS and power-off the computer, but Linux fails to do it.
I guess that the BIOS sets the things up a bit 'out of standard'.
	Thanks
Any ideas?
