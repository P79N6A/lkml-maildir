NCQ support is under development. Search the archives for Jens Axboe's recent 
patches to support this. I don't know about TCQ.

Your patch will not apply because it is linewrapped. You also need to submit 
it in a mail of its own to the relevent lists and maintainer, with your 
sign-off  (see Documentation/SubmittingPatches)

It won't compile like this because board_40518 is not a valid identifier. I 
also think it doesn't really matter as it looks like these identifier codes 
have lost their numerical meanings, and now just signify:
board_2037x - 2 port SATA, maybe with an extra PATA port
board_20319 - 4 port SATA
board_20619 - 4 port PATA
