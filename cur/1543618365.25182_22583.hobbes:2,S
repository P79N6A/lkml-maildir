kill(pid, SIGKILL) != ptrace(PTRACE_KILL, pid, NULL, NULL).
Whether the same effect as kill() is required for PTRACE_KILL is the
problem which is unrelated to this problem. If so, please argue on
another thread.
And If PTRACE_SYSCALL, PTRACE_CONT, and PTRACE_SINGLESTEP can send the
signal, PTRACE_KILL also work.
BTW, did you read my first email? What do you think of my suggestion?
In an example,
ptrace_attach(),
	if (task->p_pptr != current) {
		REMOVE_LINKS(task);
		task->p_pptr = current;
		SET_LINKS(task);
	}
	write_unlock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
	stopped = (task->state == TASK_STOPPED);
	send_sig(SIGSTOP, task, 1);
	if (stopped)
		wake_up_process(task);
	return 0;
Note, this code isn't investigating at all.
