Ok.
Athlon likely reports its cacheline size too in 8000_0005 / ECX (I think,
not checked), but it doesn't have the CLFLUSH bit, you're right.

Hmm, yes it's broken. 19 is CFLUSH in the 8000_0001 extended CPUID word,
but not in index 0000_0001. Copied wrong from cpufeature.h.
Probably it should reinitialize x86_capability[0] from 80000001 when
available, but need to double check the list.
Broken in i386 too.
