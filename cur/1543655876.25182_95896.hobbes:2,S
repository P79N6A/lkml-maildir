   Never say never ;-) 
   I need to change it now as a temporary workaround for a problem in
   the UMTS core network of my company. But I think there could be
   thousands of situations where a fine tuning of this TCP parameter
   could be useful.
You still aren't giving specific examples and details of
the problem you are seeing.
