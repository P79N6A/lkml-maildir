Yeah, that is tricky ... see below.

That's easy. I actually already hand filter the bugs, and forward to
linux-kernel those that seem to have enough information in to be useful
to people, and aren't already fixed.
There's also a mailing list for seeing every new bug that people can 
sign up for if they want (send me private email).

That is possible to do - there's patches to Bugzilla that implement an
email interface, but it has some problems like the one you pointed out
above. One possiblility is to make people manually do something to the
email for each reply, but that's rather ugly. 
Hopefully we can discuss this more at OLS this year, and get a plan 
going forward that people are happy with. I'm well aware that Bugzilla
is not the perefect tool, but I think it's better than what we had 
before (yeah, I know some of us disagree), and is easy to change.
I'd rather start with something simple, and evolve it to the needs of
the community than try dumping something complex onto people up front.

Yup, that's easy to set up if you like. Or we can do it as a new list
if you prefer.

There's a QA field we can hack into doing that easily, but I want to
ensure people are happy auto-cc'ing lists before I do it. Or I can
forward the relevant ones by hand if you prefer. If it's going to piss 
people off more than it makes them happy, it's not worth it though.
Moreover, the bugme default owner doesn't have to be the code maintainer,
so if Dave wants someone else to do the "bug shuffling" stuff, that's
another way to go.
