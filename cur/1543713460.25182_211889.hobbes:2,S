Unfortunately, this doesn't solve the problem. Seems that the panic it's 
triggered a little later (1-2 minutes instead of a few seconds), but 
anyway I have a kernel panic every time, also with this patch.
The oops tracing looks very similar to the one I've posted on the 
linux-kernel list.
Thank you Andrew, bye!
