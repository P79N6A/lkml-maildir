Personally, I have LONG wished all /proc/* entries were shell parsable values, eg:
	cpu_family=5
	model=9
	model_name='AMD-K6(tm) 3D+ Processor'
etc. The amound of userland parsing code this would obviate must be quite
large, and it certainly would make simple scripts to do things with the
values much easier.
instead, there are all these "pretty" files, with formatting code that
properly belongs in userland tools residing in the kernel (yes, mostly
just printf but still).
Flame on dudes,
