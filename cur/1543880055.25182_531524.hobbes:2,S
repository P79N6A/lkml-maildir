It's totally to do with the dual arrays.  The only real purpose of the 
time slice in O(1) (regardless of what its perceived purpose was) was to 
control the switching between the arrays.

This is an artefact of trying to control nice using time slices while 
using them for controlling array switching and whatever else they were 
being used for.  Priority (static and dynamic) is the the best way to 
implement nice.

No.  It would be nice if the basic ideas that each scheduler tries to 
implement could be extracted and explained though.  This could lead to a 
melding of ideas that leads to something quite good.

In that case I'd go O(1) provided that the k factor for the O(1) wasn't 
greater than O(logN)'s k factor multiplied by logMaxN.
