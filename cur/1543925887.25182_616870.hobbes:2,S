I was following the coding style used for rest of the APIs
like ext4_set_bit.

arm and below list of arch doesn't include the asm-generic/bitops/ext2-non-atomic.h 
I did a grep and that list the below architectures as also affected.
arm, m68k, m68knommu, s390

That should be a separate patch altogether. I wanted to do the cleanup
along with the usages such as but never got time to do the same.
#define ocfs2_set_bit ext2_set_bit
#define udf_set_bit(nr,addr) ext2_set_bit(nr,addr)
direct usage in mb
md/bitmap.c +799
md/dm-log.c +177
I will send a patch tomorrow that fix  arm and other architectures. I guess the cleanup
can be a separate patch ?
