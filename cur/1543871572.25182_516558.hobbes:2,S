Sorry for the slow delay.  I was out of town for my brothers wedding the last few
days.
I wasn't exactly expecting the WARN_ON to trigger.  What I fixed was
an inconsistency in handling our state bits.  Fixing that
inconsistency appears to have fixed the e1000 usage scenario mostly by
accident.
The basic issue is that pci_save_state saves the current msi state
along with other registers, and then the e1000 driver goes and
disables the msi irq after we have saved the irq state as on.
My code notices that the msi irq was disabled before restore time, so
it skips the restore.  However we now have a leak of the msi saved cap
because we are not freeing it. 
This leaves with some basic questions.
- Does it make sense for suspend/resume methods to request/free irqs?
- Does it make sense for suspend/resume methods to allocate/free msi irqs?
- Do we want pci_save/restore_cap to save/restore msi state?
The path of least resistance is to just free the extra state and we
are good.  I'm just not quite certain that is sane and it has been a
long day.
