There have been quite a few posts to linux-kernel about IDE diagnostic
messages that people are interpreting as fatal errors when they
aren't, and I've noticed that Documentation/ide.txt hasn't been
updated much for a long time - maybe it would be worth bringing it up
to date?
Is the current maintainer Mark Lord or Marcin Dalecki?  In the 2.5.x
tree, it's had obsolete info removed, but it hasn't been brought up to
date.
John.
