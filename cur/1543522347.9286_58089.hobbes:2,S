Are you seed that message there is LINK, not just plain text ? And if you'll
press it you'll see that there are more detailed explanation of blacklisted
netblocks. 216.200.201.193 is NOT in ORBS's blacklist, it's in ORBS's whitelist:
-- cut --
[khim@dell khim]$ host 193.201.200.216.relays.orbs.org.
Host not found.
[khim@dell khim]$ host -t TXT 193.201.200.216.ok.orbs.org.
193.201.200.216.ok.orbs.org is a nickname for 2.0.127.127.ok.orbs.org
2.0.127.127.ok.orbs.org descriptive text "This server has been tested by ORBS and appears to be secure against relaying"
