Sigh - I use Pine, follow Documents/email-clients.txt for the
recommended settings and obviously the pathces are not generated with
whitespace damage at my end as I test those before sending out.
So although I hate to see this happen there is nothing at this moment
that I can do - except for attaching the patch instead of inlining it.
Since they have already been reviewed inline, please see if the
attached patches work for you.
