Hi,
I have a quick question (just from curiosity):
If we have a hipotetical machine with two harddrives,
and on both we make a swap partitions, will Linux
try to swap on not-actually-used disk ?
I mean something like: we have some disk activity
on hda1 and Linux has to swap something in,
will it swap to swap partition on hda or hdb ?
I'm sorry if it's not a good place to ask such
a question, and if so - please guide me in the
good direction.
Thanks in advance,
-- laslo
