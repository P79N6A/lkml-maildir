You seem to make the usual mistakes when people start to think about
this problem.  But I could misinterpret you, so let me paraphrase your
mail in questions and answer what I believe you said.
Q: Are journaling filesystems identical to log-structured filesystems?
Not quite.  Journaling filesystems usually have a very small journal (or
log, same thing) and only store the information necessary for atomic
transactions in the journal.  Not sure what a "journal FS" is, but the
name seems closer to a journaling filesystem.
Q: DualFS seperates Data and Metadata.  Does that make a difference?
Not really.  What I called "data" in my previous mail is a
log-structured filesystems view of data.  DualFS stored file content
seperately, so from an lfs view, that doesn't even exist.  But directory
content exists and behaves just like file content wrt. the deadlock
problem.  Any data or metadata that cannot be GC'd by simply copying but
requires writing further information like indirect blocks, B-Tree nodes,
etc. will cause the problem.
Q: If the user simply reserves some extra space, does the problem go
away?
Definitely not.  It will be harder to hit, but a rare deadlock is still
a deadlock.  Again, this is only concerned with the log-structured part
of DualFS, so we can ignore the Data volume.
When data is spread perfectly across all segments, the best segment one
can pick for GC is just as bad as the worst.  So let us take some
examples.  If 50% of the lfs is free, you can pick a 50% segment for GC.
Writing every single block in it may require writing one additional
indirect block, so GC is required to write out a 100% segment.  It
doesn't make any progress at 50% (in a worst case scenario) and could
deadlock if less than 50% were free.
If, however, GC has to write out a singly and a doubly indirect block,
67% of the lfs need to be free.  In general, if the maximum height of
your tree is N, you need (N-1)/N * 100% free space.  Most people refer
to that as "too much".
If you have less free space, the filesystem will work just fine "most of
the time".  That is nice and cool, but it won't help your rare user that
happens to hit the rare deadlock.  Any lfs needs a strategy to prevent
this deadlock for good, not just make it mildly unlikely.
