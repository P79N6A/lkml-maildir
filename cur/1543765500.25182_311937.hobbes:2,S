howdy,
yesterday i hit an Oops when i tried to play an mp3 with xmms. nothing
unusual. the thing is - i've not changed the kernel (2.6.11-gentoo-r5) for
a while, but changed some (multimedia related) libs on my system. xmms
just segfaults and it all seems to be a proper userspace bug (even xmms
told me so). i really suspect xmms or the changed libs.
but i still believe in the old proverb my grandma used to say: "no
userspace app should make the kernel oops." but yesterday it did:
http://nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.11-gentoo-r5/
this is 100% reproducable whenever i use the ALSA sounddriver in xmms.
when i use "mpg321 -o alsa ..." everything is ok.
maybe some guru can shed some light on what's going on in xmms-oops.txt
and tell me who's to bug here :->
thank you,
Christian.
