Fix checks that failed to realize that values are 4-kB-unit-sized
(note the format strings in this same diff context which *do* realize the
unit size, via appended "000"!).
Also fix an incorrect below-1MB area check (as gathered from Jan Beulich's
unapplied patch at
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0411.1/1378.html
 )
Update mtrr_add_page() docu to make 4-kB-sized calculation more obvious.
Given several further items mentioned in Jan's patch mail, all in all
MTRR code seems surprisingly buggy, for a surprisingly long period of time
(many years). Further work/investigation would be useful.
Note that my patch is pretty much UNTESTED, since I can only verify that
it successfully boots my machine, but I cannot test against actual buggy
hardware which would require these (formerly broken) checks.
Long -mm simmering would make sense, especially since these now-working
checks might turn out to have adverse effects on unaffected hardware.
