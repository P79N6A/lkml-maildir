Hi,
Due to the fact that I was bitten by this bug (I thought it is a feature), and a bit of lack
of understanding of NFS4 I want to ask few questions about NFS:
1) I want to export whole file-system  with submounts to a range of clients.
As 'exports' manual says I can't do so, is that true?
Can you tell me how properly to use crossmnt and nohide?
Where should I put those options in root file-system export or in submount export?
2) NFS4 - I can't get it working:
*I have a LFS system, and this is what I did (NFS3 works fine, but crossmnt, and nohide seems not to work, probably due to above bug)
	I also have seen errors about stale handles 
*Kernel - 2.6.24-rc3 with NFS3/4 client/server enabled on both host and guest. (both client and server running this kernel)
*rpc.idmapd running on both client and server + all standard NFS3 tools
*NFS tools 1.1.1 with nfs4 support compiled + without GSS (on server)
* /etc/exports with fsid=0: (on server)
	/tmp *(fsid=0,insecure,rw,async,anonuid=100,anongid=1000)
* mounting with -tnfs4 server:/ /mnt/tmp
Still doesn't work, using wireshark shows that
	NFSV4 COMPOUND call with
		Opcode: PUTROOTFH (24)
		Opcode: GETFH (10)
		Opcode: GETATTR (9)
Fails with 
	Reject State: AUTH_ERROR (1)
	Auth State: bad credential (seal broken) (1)
Any ideas?
(I decided to switch to NFS4 only due to the lack of ability to see underlying mounts)
The system I am connecting to is a very old P1 system I use as a terminal
(X and ssh)
When I need to install something there I mount whole / of in on my main Core2 system
chroot there, and compile/install.
Best regrads,
