I guess I still prefer the GFP_KERNEL fallback because it avoids to
waste/reserve lots of ram, but I only care about correctness, the
current code isn't correct, doing max_cpus * max tree depth would
satisfy me completely too (saving ram is a lower prio), so it's up to
you as far as it cannot fail unless it's truly oom (i.e. you need a
GFP_KERNEL in your way).

You will have """only""" 18 layers, but scanning through 2**(6*18)
entries will take too long time even if only entry takes 1 nanosecond to
scan. Of course that's the extreme case, but still it should be too much
in practice. I doubt you can avoid at least an additional infrastructure
that tells you if any of the underlying ratnodes has any dirty page,
which will probably save ram at least because it can be coded as a
bitflag in each node, but that will force you an up-walk of the tree
every time you mark a page dirty (but of course also a second tree would
force you to do some tree every time you mark a page dirty/clean). The
second tree probably allows you not to go into the radix-tree
implementation details to provide the "underlying node dirty page" info,
and it would be faster if for example only the start of the inode has
dirty pages, that would allow the dirty page flushing to walk only a few
levels instead of potential 18 of them even to reach the first  few
pages. But I don't think it's a common case, so probably the best
(but not simpler) approch is to mark each ratnode with a dirty
cumulative information.
