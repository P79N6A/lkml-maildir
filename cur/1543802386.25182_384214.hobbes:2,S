2G/2G is not the only viable alternative. On my 1GB x86 box I'm
using "lowmem1g" patches for both 2.4 and 2.6, which results in
2.75G for user-space. I'm sure others have other preferences.
Any standard option for this should either have several hard-coded
alternatives, or should support arbitrary values (within reason).
