You can use the userspace utility called 'setpci' which, if run as root,
allows you to tweak such things.  For insance, say you wanted to set byte
register 0x55 to value 0x1c on a pci device who's vendor/device id combo
is 1106:3099, you would do:
setpci -d 1106:3099 55.B=1c
To query this register without setting anything, do:
setpci -d 1106:3099 55.B
And, of course, man setpci will sell you more.. :)
