The test program contains several errors. Here is a 'fixed' version.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
static void empty(int sig)
{
	printf ("hello\n");
	return;
}
void main()
{
        int fd, a;
        struct sigaction sa;
        char buf[512];
	if (fd = open("/dev/zero", O_RDONLY) < 0)
	{
		perror ("open");
		exit(1);
	}
        sigaction(SIGALRM, NULL, &sa);
        sa.sa_handler = empty;
        sa.sa_flags   = SA_INTERRUPT;
        sigaction(SIGALRM, &sa, NULL);
	alarm (1);
        while ((a = read(fd, buf, 511)) > 0)
            ;
	if (a == -1)
	{
		perror ("read");
		exit(1);
	}
	else printf ("EOF\n");
        exit(0);
}
First, you need to read something that can be interrupted. A 511 byte
read from a small file will probably never be interrupted. The code
can be spending much more time in the 'while (funny stuff)' loop than
it takes to read that file.
I chose to read from an infinite-size 'file'.
Second, your 'C' runtime library probably defaults to non-BSD signals.
That is to say, the "SA_RESTART" bit is probably set in the flags.
To get the system call interrupted, you need to have that bit clear.
The way to do it is with sigaction(); signal() is just not capable
of doing what you want, now that 'C' runtime libraries default to
POSIX-signal behavior rather than BSD-signals.
FYI, main() can never be void. It must return an 'int'.
  while (a && a != -1) a = read(fd, buf, 511);
doesn't make much sense. (a && a) is either TRUE or FALSE. It
will, therefore NEVER be -1. Maybe you meant (a & a)? If so,
why not just (a != -1) or (a > 0) ?
