Al,
AFAICS the problem is the following:
  - NFS sillyrenames dentry 1
  - Upon return from nfs_unlink(), VFS unhashes dentry 1
  - Upon next lookup, VFS+NFS conspire to create aliased dentry 2 to
    sillyrenamed file
  - Upon last close of files associated with dentry 1, NFS completes
    sillyrename. File is unlinked on server.
  - Aliased dentry 2 is still around, but it is now pointing to stale
    fh.
IOW we just want to prevent VFS from unhashing the dentry in the first
place: dentry aliasing cannot work together with sillyrename.
Cheers,
  Trond
