Below is a patch against 2.2.5 that implements this.
Features:
- On Pentium and pre-Pentium systems, it works just as before. Their
chipsets should disable caching outside of main memory using the KEN#
pin, but changing the behaviour isn't worth the risk.
- The PPro and successors have no cache enable/disable pins -- the
MTRRs are supposed to be used instead. So the right thing to do is to
normally leave PCD and PWT unset on pages, so the MTRRs can work
properly.
- O_SYNC disables caching by setting both the PCD and PWT bits. The
extra PWT has no effect on Pentium and pre-Pentium systems. On the
PPro and successors, both bits need to be set to disable caching
whatever the MTRR type may be.
- I renamed _PAGE_WT to _PAGE_PWT, because that's what the Intel docs
actually call it.
So with this patch, O_SYNC can be used to map /dev/mem as uncached,
without interactions with the MTRRs.
It won't make any difference for non-Intel x86 processors (though it
won't fix any similar problems they might have; I'd be grateful if
anyone familiar with the memory type facilities on AMD and Cyrix
processors could check this out).
(drivers/video/fbmem.c and drivers/video/sgivwfb.c use _PAGE_PCD and
so probably need tweaking. But pgprot_noncached and noncached_address
should be moved into arch-specific headers first.)
