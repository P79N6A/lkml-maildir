Hi,
We have a SH7729 based system(SH 7729 based hardware of V610/V612
Intelligent terminal).I want to know whether the basic CPU porting for the
SH7729 processor for Linux has been done.If so can you mention the details
of the web site where the patch for this processor is present
Thanks and Regards
