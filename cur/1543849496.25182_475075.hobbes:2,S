Of course.

You don't need to do that. Nothing will use the new mm.
You might also want a flush before the flush_tlb_mm.
Actually, we should turn this into a single call, so architectures
can optimise it however they like.

That does close the race. We just need to ensure that all architectures
can handle this case.
And we need to figure out whether any of the other code that follows the
same flush_cache_* .. flush_tlb_* is buggy in the presence of other
threads writing into the cache in between.
I suspect they may well be, and you probably only noticed the issue in
fork, because the window is so large.
Places where we want to remove the mapping completely are going to be
more tricky to fix. Either we need to transition to readonly, then flush,
then transition to invalid, or arch code needs to be reworked
(the single operation caches and tlb flush will do the trick, but that
might to do an IPI, which is bad).

OK, I'm not arguing against any other changes. Hmm... I don't see how you
can kmap_coherent the "from" page when it can be mapped into more than one
virtual address? Does the MIPS port restrict remapping to the same colour?
