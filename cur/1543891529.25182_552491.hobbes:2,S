really nice stuff! :-)

i'm wondering, why not use (1 << 30) both as the base and as the flag? 
That would make integration of the new fd space 'seemless' in terms of 
dup2() use.

yeah, please do that now - lets not leave any incomplete areas. We've 
too often made the mistake of not pushing through new APIs consistently 
enough.
I'd also suggest a new sys_socket2() call that takes a 'flags' parameter 
as well - because one primary user of this facility will be networking 
servers. (O_UNSEQFD would make sense for it and O_NDELAY - currently 
network apps that want to set O_NDELAY need to do it with an extra 
fcntl() - while they could already indicate this in the sys_socket() 
call, if it were closer to sys_open() semantics)
in any case, your patch is looking really good and already deserves an 
ack!
