Subject: "Fix" in 2.3.13-7 for ne2k-pci.c causes OOPS on boot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

	I've got a RealTek 8029 card, in my UP PPro (actually the card is not
currently used.) However, the one-line fix to ne2k-pci.c apparently
isn't enough:
-               pci_ioaddr = pdev->base_address[0] &
PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_IO_MASK;
+               pci_ioaddr = pdev->resource[0].start;
It seems like that should work... but apparently it doesn't.  Maybe it
only worked before because I didn't actually USE the card.
The oops happened before anything got printed out, but removing the ne2k
from the config fixed it.  Here is the oops (by hand):
         ?       pci_probes   ne2k_pci_probe   ioport_resource
Stack: c0003b20   c01c8c10    c01c72c2        c01aaf6b0
EIP:  c0117cbb (release_resource)
               init    kernel_thread
call trace:  c0106097 c0107978
Wierdly enough, pci_probes is an array, not a function, and
ioport_resource is a structure.
