After reading about SA_RESTART, ok.  However, couldn't those
applications that require it enable this behaviour explicitly?
The problem I'm having right now is with pthread_create() failing
because deep somewhere in either the kernel or glibc, nanosleep()
returns EINTR during said pthread_create() and pthread_create() fails.
I've got a multithreaded program written using gcc (2.95.2) and glibc
(2.1.3), and it's talking to a natively threaded Java program (tried
both Sun & Blackdown ports, both 1.2.2 and 1.3) on a 2.2.17 kernel.  The
C program is listening for incoming socket connections, and the Java
program is hammering on it with many parallel connect() calls.  After a
short, a bit random interval, pthread_create() will fail in either my
program, or deep in the Java VM.  I assume that the Java VM is using
pthread_create().
I don't mean to sound like a psycho on this, but I can't see why
SA_RESTART isn't the default behavior.  Maybe I'm missing something
somewhere.
