       Sorry for taking so long to report back,but I've been busy.
       Results: Adding the above macro entry to line 82 of unusual_devs.h
(2.4.19) resulted in the flash reader being detected by usb_storage. When
the sd_mod module was loaded, /dev/discs/disc1 snapped into being. I
accessed the CompactFlash drive as part1 with an 8MB VFAT-formatted unit and
was able to perform any filesystem operation needed.
       This should be pushed into a USB BK/CVS tree or even forwarded to
Marcelo. BTW, is there a way to keep sd_mod from failing to read the empty
drives?
Thanks,
Brad Chapman
