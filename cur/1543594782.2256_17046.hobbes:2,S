Yep, so if you are running on a Yopy, try not to sync after each byte.

It doesn't work that way, it tacks the flush onto the trailing edge of a 
burst of disk activity, or it flushes out an isolated update, say an edit 
save, which would have required the same amount of disk activity, just a few 
seconds off in the future.  Sometimes it does write a few extra sectors when 
disk activity is sporadic, but the impact on total throughput is small enough 
to be hard to measure reliably.  Even so, there is some optimizing that could 
be done - the update could be interleaved a little better with the falling 
edge of a heavy traffic episode.  This would require that the io rate be 
monitored instead of just the queue backlog.  I'mi nterested in tackling that 
eventually - it has applications in other areas than just the early update.
