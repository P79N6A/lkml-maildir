Hi Mike, 
What chipset was that?  
This board has an nVidia nForce 3 chipset on it.  This brings about
another question. What is the consensus on using the amd74xx.c patch for
the nForce 3/4 chipset that nVidia has on their website?  It's supposed
to improve HD performance. Any comments on including that patch in the
existing kernel?  How about the pros and or cons of adding that patch
and rebuilding a system specific kernel?
Stan
