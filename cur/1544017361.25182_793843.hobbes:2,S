Could you try one more experiment?  With your working system, please cherry
pick these commits and try it again?
68564a4... work_on_cpu: don't try to get_online_cpus() in work_on_cpu.
e1d9ec6... work_on_cpu: Use our own workqueue.
6eb714c... cpufreq: use work_on_cpu in acpi-cpufreq.c for drv_read and drv_write
From git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/travis/linux-2.6-cpus4096-for-ingo.git
If that works, then try and un-revert e39ad415ac and see if it's fixed as well?
(The underlying work_on_cpu() function was causing these problems, but the 1st two
of the above should fix it.)
Thanks!
Mike
