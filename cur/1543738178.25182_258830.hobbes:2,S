Yes, and sometimes you specifically want to make sure you pick up the
right official binary, and not some other one that happens to be in $PATH.
If somebody manages to get automount launched with an insecure $PATH, you
could end up invoking a trojaned mount command (remember why "." in $PATH
is a security issue....)
