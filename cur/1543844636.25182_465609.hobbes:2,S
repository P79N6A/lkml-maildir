Given that the definition of ZONE_DMA is, I think we agree, nonsensical
in generic code anyway, whatever we do is going to be a pain.
I disagree that what you're doing is consistent with established
usage, see PPC64 for example, which I assumed you'd changed to be
consistent with what you're doing ... but it seems you haven't.
Your definition is one way of interpreting the current setup. It even
makes some sort of sense, I'll admit. However, there are other
definitions that make perfect sense too, which just goes to show that
the concept of ZONE_DMA is just a frigging inconsistent mess to start
with.

That is one possible way of defining it, but seeing as there is no
agreed to, documented definition, it's hard to tell whether this trumps
such other defined constants such as "GFP_DMA means gives me memory from
ZONE_DMA", which you're now violating.

It seems odd that PPC64 has worked fine this way for a long time then?

The last sentence in this is your opinion, not an agreed-to definition.
Look, whatever we do is not going to be wholly clean, as the definitons
and requirements we start from are loose, inconsistent and somewhat
contradictary on occasion. So what we are left with is picking something
that is:
1. As consistent as possible across architectures.
2. As simple as possible.
If you can agree with the other arch maintainers (eg PPC64) that
stuffing it all in ZONE_NORMAL is somehow better than ZONE_DMA, then
maybe we can meet (1).
However, whatever you do, meeting (2) is rather hard - it's a damned
sight simpler to stuff it all in ZONE_DMA because that's the end of
the fallback list.
