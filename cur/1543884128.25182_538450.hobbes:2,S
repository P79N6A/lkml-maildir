Given the current state and the current rate of development I'd expect slub
to have reached the level of completion which you're describing around -rc2
or -rc3.  I think we'd be pretty safe making that assumption.
This is a bit unusual but there is of course some self-interest here: the
patch dependencies are getting awful and having this hanging around
out-of-tree will make 2.6.23 development harder for everyone.
So on balance, given that we _do_ expect slub to have a future, I'm
inclined to crash ahead with it.  The worst that can happen will be a later
rm mm/slub.c which would be pretty simple to do.
otoh I could do some frantic patch mangling and make it easier to carry
slub out-of-tree, but do we gain much from that?
