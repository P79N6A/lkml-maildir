The maximum frequency for the SPI bus is 26 MHz, WLAN driver is to work 
at true 10 Mbit/sec.

P. S. I'm speaking not about this particular case during most part of 
this conversation. Sound cards behind the SPI bus will suffer a lot more 
since it's their path to use wXrY functions (lotsa small transfers) 
rather than WLAN's.
