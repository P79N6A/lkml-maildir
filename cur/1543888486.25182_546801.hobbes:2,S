OK people, this is what I did just to resolve the issue for now:
1. copied loop.c from 2.6.21 into the 2.6.22-rc2 tree
2. changed exactly two entries from "invalidate_bdev(bdev, 0)"
to "invalidate_bdev(bdev)"
Output is:
a. a compilable kernel
b. all four iso images are mounted as expected
Andrey's path however (i. e. copying his attached version of loop.c into the 
2.6.22-rc2 kernel tree) led to:
a. an incompilable kernel
b. endless messages trying to compile loop.c going like this (just a part of 
them - not complete anyway!):
