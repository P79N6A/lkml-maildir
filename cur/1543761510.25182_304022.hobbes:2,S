I have a patch around somewhere that provides a way to do this from
userspace and sysfs, but it's racy and not really acceptable in it's
current form.  Search the lkml archives for details and the patch if you
are interested.
But that would require you to rebuild your kernel :)
And yes, we are working on adding this support for mainline, still
working on it...
