Subject: TCP TIME-WAIT bug in Linux 2.2.5 (still there I think)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linux 2.2.5 (and I think later versions as well - I can't find a fix in
the patch sets for 2.2 or 2.3) does not ACK a FIN received when in
TIME-WAIT. This leads to connections on the remote host taking longer to
die than they should, and connections on the Linux host remaining in
TIME-WAIT longer than they should. 
Scenario:
Host1 (Linux)                           Host 2 (anything, including Linux)
-------------                           ----------------------------------
Send FIN, enter FIN-WAIT1
                                        Send ACK of FIN, enter CLOSE-WAIT
Receive ACK of FIN, enter FIN-WAIT2
                                        Send FIN, enter LAST-ACK
Send ACK of FIN, enter TIME-WAIT
                                        (ACK is lost)
                                        Retransmit FIN, stay in LAST_ACK
Receive retransmitted FIN and drop
it (this is in tcp_timewait_process)
and reset 2MSL timer
                                        Retransmit FIN again
.....
and so on, until Host 2 decides to finally give up. The Linux behavior is
in violation of
RFC 793, page 73:
TIME-WAIT STATE
The only thing that can arrive in this state is a retransmission of the
remote FIN. Acknowledge it, and restart the 2 MSL timeout.
A similar thing was fixed in 2.2.7 I think (quick look at patch) but it
does not seem to fix the problem for connections in TIME-WAIT, it is in
tcp_rcv_state_process I think (modifies sequence number check to deal with
retransmitted FIN - I'm not aware what that problem was, I'm just reading
the comment). 
I'm a bit rushed the next few days, so sorry I don't have a patch. It is
more than a quick patch because at this place we don't have a socket so we
can't just call tcp_send_ack or something... I can't think of a way out
except to painfully build a complete ACK packet, and that would be ugly. I
hope others have better ideas.
