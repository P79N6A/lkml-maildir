Ok and how do you propose to implement
	int gee_whiz_this_configuration_works(void)
Remembering that there are several devices/setups that _only_ work in 2.4 
because we set things up ourselves. Stuff that isnt hot plug. Little things
like the sound on the vaio. In fact if the BIOS is in PnP OS mode (which on
some newer bioses is the only option) we _have_ to set stuff up.
Now how about checking the BIOS tables and seeing if they are wrong. If so then
someone can do something about it. Right now this is speculation and needs
verifying.
