Subject: Modem in polled mode

> Hello,

> I am using an ISA modem on a linux m/c. I have opened a

> However because of some limitation, I want to operate the

>
> 1) Can I disable the interrupts on the modem (UART - IER

> anything like this)
> 2) If the interrupts are disabled, how do I read the data in
> the UART FIFO.
