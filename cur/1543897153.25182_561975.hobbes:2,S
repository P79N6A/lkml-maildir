Definitely.

If we keep the page mapping information with the page all the time (ie
writepage doesn't have to call get_block ever), it may be possible to
avoid sending down a locked page.  But, I don't know the delayed
allocation internals well enough to say for sure if that is true.
Either way, writepage is the easiest of the bunch because it can be
deferred.
