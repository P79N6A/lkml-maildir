We need page->mapping and page->index set for pages used for pte and
pmd pages, so that we can get from a pte_t * back to the mm_struct *
and the address within that mm.  It's just a matter of setting
page->mapping and page->index in the pte_alloc and pmd_alloc
functions.
I just looked at Hugh's anobjrmap 6/6 patch and it looks to me that it
does that correctly.
Regards,
Paul.
