Hmmm... Some more comments

Right but that situation is rare and the performance is certainly
better if the unpinned processes are not all running on the same 
processor.

That wont work since the notion of "pinned" is relative to a cpu.
A process may be pinned to a group of processors. It will only appear to 
be pinned for cpus outside that set of processors!
What good does storing a processor number do if the processes can change 
dynamically and so may the pinning of processors. We are dealing with
a set of processes. Each of those may be pinned to a set of processors.

I think we should fix the problem ASAP. Lets do this fix and then we can 
think about other solutions. You already had lots of time to think about
the rotor.
This looks to me as a design flaw that would require either a major rework 
of the scheduler or (my favorite) a delegation of difficult (and 
computational complex and expensive) scheduler decisions to user space.
