"Whatever" indeed:
There's an ASL Match() for a "PMPT" (Primary Master PorT) PCI register,
and the possible register values are:
                    Package (0x04)
                    {
                        0x20,
                        0x31,
                        0x65,
                        0xA8
                    },
and from
                OperationRegion (CFG2, PCI_Config, 0x40, 0x20)
                Field (CFG2, DWordAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
                {
                            Offset (0x08),·
                    SSPT,   8,·
                    SMPT,   8,·
                    PSPT,   8,·
                    PMPT,   8,·
                            Offset (0x10),·
...
we can infer that at PCI_Config offset 0x48 those values should be located.
However after bootup or resume there are:
# lspci -s 00:11.1 -xxx

As one can see, the relevant values for SSPT, SMPT, PSPT and PMPT are
99 99 20 20, which are not quite entirely valid judging from the array above,
and this is because the secondary port is unused, as can also be seen
from my bootup log:
scsi0 : pata_via
scsi1 : pata_via
ata1: PATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x1f0 ctl 0x3f6 bmdma 0xe400 irq 14
ata2: PATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x170 ctl 0x376 bmdma 0xe408 irq 15

Manually tweaking the values to 20 20 20 20 truly does skip the _GTM failure message on suspend -
only to reappear right on resume due to 99 99 20 20 combo happening again.
If I don't tweak, I get _GTM failure at both suspend and resume.
As such one can conclude that this BIOS is rather very confused when being called for _GTM on an entirely
unused controller port. And this is either because the BIOS is dumb or because ACPI doesn't really
expect anyone to call _GTM on an unused physical port. I'd bet on the latter...
(however I haven't found ACPI 3.0b explicitly mentioning this somewhere yet)
