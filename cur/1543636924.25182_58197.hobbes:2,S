Should we rename __set_current_state to set_current_state, and put the
mb() inside add_wait_queue(), add_wait_queue_exclusive() and maybe
add_wait_queue_cond()?
People are getting confused by set_current_state() vs
__set_current_state(), esp. since it's only meaningful for
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE/UNINTERRUPTIBLE.
Thoughts?
Rusty.
