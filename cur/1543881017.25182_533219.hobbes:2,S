Subject: [PATCH] Remove "obsolete" label from ISDN4Linux (v3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/21/89

From: Tilman Schmidt <tilman@imap.cc>
The "obsolete" label on the ISDN_I4L Kconfig option is not, and
has never been, accurate. It has already prompted repeated attempts
to remove actively used functionality from the kernel without a
working replacement. This patch removes the incorrect label and
corrects the accompanying help text.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice.
In practice, there is.
