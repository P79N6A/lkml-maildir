It's attempting to properly automatically enable a reiserfs feature
supporting attributes (via chattr/lsattr interface).  When mounting
(w/out attrs mount option) a reiserfs that should support attrs, the
above patch fixes the value OR'd with s_mount_opt (which was incorrectly
the shift value rather than the shifted value).  This has been backed
out in current -stable queue, and was fixed in Linus' tree as well.
