Yup, off-by-block in fs/fat/cache.c. Please, try the following:

                        return 0;
                return sector+sb->dir_start;
        }
-       if (sector >= MSDOS_I(inode)->mmu_private>>9)
+       if (sector >= (MSDOS_I(inode)->mmu_private+511)>>9)
                return 0;
        cluster = sector/sb->cluster_size;
        offset = sector % sb->cluster_size;
- it should solve the problem. Sorry about that.
