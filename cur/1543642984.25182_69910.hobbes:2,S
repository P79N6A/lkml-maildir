I agree. There has been a lot of talk on this topic, but I don't think 
much has gotten down on paper, though there might be some in the 
archives...
The main ideal that we're shooting for is to have one ASCII value per
file. The ASCII part is mandatory, but there will definitely be exceptions
where we will have an array of or multiple values per file. We want to
minimize those instances, though. Both for the sake of easy parsing, but
also for easy formatting within the drivers.

Yes. One of the pipe dreams I have, which will hopefully become a reality 
in the future is to document the attributes when they're defined with a 
docbook-like comment. These can then be extracted and inserted into a 
database. 
We're working on a utility that abstracts the layout of driverfs from the
user. This will allow you do things like list all the devices and drivers
of a particular bus or class type, as well as display their attributes. 
With a database of attribute descriptions, you can provide desciptive 
context along with the value of the attribute.

The flags bit is a good point, and should probably be removed. 
Taking a step back, I would like to note that it would be nice to do 
something at a higher level with the resource structures; i.e. put them in 
struct device and deal with them in the driver model core. This is ways 
out, though if it happens, it will likely have repercussions in their 
driverfs representation..

'name' is better referred to as 'description'. It's a bus-specified string  
that describes the device. The bus is allowed to do as it pleases with it.
