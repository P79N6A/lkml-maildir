That bug was probably fixed May 21 2003 according to cvs history.
"Patch updated: window scaling bug fixed, improved, etc. (JK)."
It updates the version to 1.9
As reference, I'm using v2.2 with -bk from 040626 which does use
wscale=7 and I don't see any problems connecting to/from machines with
lower or equal wscale. I drop and log all packets tcp-window-tracking
classifies as INVALID.
