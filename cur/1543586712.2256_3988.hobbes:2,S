I recommend using usleep(0) instead of sched_yield(). Last time I
checked, sched_yield() seemed to spin and eat CPU cycles, usleep(0)
always gives up the CPU.
Try:
	for(;;) usleep();
and 
	for(;;) sched_yield();
.. you'll see a quiet behavior under `top` for usleep(0), and over 80%
with sched_yield().
