hello.
I did a bonnie++ tests with 2.4.13-pre3(+aa vm)
 and 2.4.12-ac3(+Rick patch).
And i found that ac kernel have a big problems here.
With linux kernel i got 22 Mb/c for read 19 for write and
with ac  12 for read and 11 for write (both with ext2)
If i used ext3 with ac kernel results little bit better.
What is the reason for such regression in ac kernel ?
And yes of course i had udma for both test.
Andrei.
