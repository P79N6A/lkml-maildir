I've been half-way through reading this thread after returning, and I must
say I'm rather annoyed that 80% of it is just Roman vs Ingo and Karim vs
Jes dogfights that run in circles.  Let's try to find some majority optinion
and plans to move forward:
  *) so far everyone but Roman seems to agree we want to support dynamic
     tracing as an integral part of the tracing framework
  *) most people seem to agree that we want some form of in-source annotation
     instead of just external probes
so let's build on this rough consensus and decide on the next steps before
fighting the hard battels.  I think those important steps are:
  1) review and improve the lttng core tracing engine (without static traces
     so far) and get it into mergeable shape.  Make sure it works nicely
     from *probe dynamic tracing handlers.
  2) find a nice syntax for in-source tracing annotations, and implement a
     backend for it using lttng and *probes.
We can fight the hard fight whether we want real static tracing and how
many annotations of what form were after we have those important building
blocks.
