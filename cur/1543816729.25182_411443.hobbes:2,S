Subject: Fix unlock_buffer() to work the same way as bit_unlock()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Currently unlock_buffer() contains a smb_mb__after_clear_bit() which is 
weird because bit_spin_unlock() uses smb_mb__before_clear_bit():
From include/linux/bit_spinlock.h:
static inline void bit_spin_unlock(int bitnum, unsigned long *addr)
{
        smp_mb__before_clear_bit();
        clear_bit(bitnum, addr);
        preempt_enable();
        __release(bitlock);
}
For most architectures there is no difference because both
smp_mb__after_clear_bit() and smp_mb__before_clear_bit() are both
memory barriers and clear_buffer_locked() is an atomic operation.
However, they differ under IA64.
Note that this potential race has never been seen under IA64. It was 
discovered by inspection by Zoltan Menyhart <Zoltan.Menyhart@free.fr>. 
Regardless if this is a true race or not, I think the unlock sequence 
needs to be the same for bit locks and unlock_buffer(). Maybe 
unlock_buffer and lock_buffer better use bit spinlock operations?
Change unlock_buffer() to work the same way as bit_spin_unlock.
