I was able to duplicate the crash Benno reported.  My previous tests
apparently did not stress the system in the same manner.  I used Benno's
rtc_latency test since I dont have a sound card in my test system.
The kernel Oops happens during the disk I/O tests, although I wasnt
lucky enough to get a log of the info.
I also tried this on 2.2.13 and was able to run rtc_latency successfully
one time.  The next run had similar Oops.
I have not yet tried lowlatency-2.2.13-A1 with Benno's tests, this
could help point to the problem.
