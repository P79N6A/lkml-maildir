I seem to be on a roll today. :)
Whenever I play an mp3 from HD I get sound cutouts. I can't really say
when exactly is happening but putting the mpg into ram by running
dd if=mp3 of=/dev/null 
until no disc activity occurs seems to solve the issues. The laptop is a
p3-700, 128meg free ram, 44 bytes of swap usage and the following is
reported by hdparm:
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 256 (on)
 geometry     = 2584/240/63, sectors = 39070080, start = 0
 busstate     =  1 (on)
/dev/hda:

This does not happen with the CD-ROM drive and it's not happening now
with another mp3 (sigh...) but I have had this happen quite a few times
now.
As usual, if you want any more info, please holler.
