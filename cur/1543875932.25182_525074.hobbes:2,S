I understand. Would someone know how to disable SMM in the VIA Pro133T 
chipset (VT82C596B south bridge). What I/O ports do I need to write to, 
and what values should I write to these ports?

I have disabled everything I could find in the BIOS. Serial and parallel 
ports, USB, integrated sound, APM, ACPI, booting from exotic hardware or 
from the network. To no avail :-(

I see that they have a Linux kernel module to disable SMM in Intel 
chipsets. But I didn't see the equivalent for VIA chipsets.

Indeed...
I wonder if VIA thinks their old chipsets were industrial-grade.
