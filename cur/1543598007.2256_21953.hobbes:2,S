   I would hope that it would warn: what if a is the maximum size that an
   array can be and b is a value passed in from userland?  Most definately
   not an expected result.
My example was poor, consider if 'b' was something like '100'
or for some other reason you already know perfectly well
the legal range of 'b' or 'a'.
