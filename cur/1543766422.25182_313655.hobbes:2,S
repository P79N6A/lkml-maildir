Actually, can you make the signature be detached and a seperate 
object? Ie, add a signature object in its own right, distinct from 
tag. They could then:
- be used to sign any kind of object
- allow objects to be signed by multiple people
Ideally, there'd be an index of signature objects by the SHA-1 sum of 
the object they sign, as the signed object should not refer to the 
signature (or the second of the above is not possible).
The latter of the two points would, in combination with the former, 
allow for cryptographic 'signed-off-by' chains. If a 'commit' is 
signed by $RANDOM_CONTRIBUTOR and $SUBSYSTEM_MAINTAINER and $ANDREW, 
you know its time to pull it. Would also work for things like "fixes 
only" trees, where (say) a change must be approved by X/2+1 of a 
group of X hacker providing oversight -> looking up the commit 
object's signatures would tell you whether it was approved.
No idea whether this is possible or practical. :) But it would be 
good for future flexibility to avoid including the signature in the 
object being signed.
