On a second note:  Could someone please provide an explanation of why
the raid10 driver exists?  People have created RAID-10 sets for years
using the RAID-0 driver on top of several RAID-1 arrays - this works
beautifully, it's simple, and it's easy to explain to people.
Why oh why, do we need raid10 ?
(I don't mean to bitch and moan over it - I just assume that there is a
good reason for it which was somehow never conveyed, or that I
overlooked in my search for this explanation)
And; if raid10 does not provide new functionality that was not possible
with raid1 + raid0, why oh why does this get accepted in a stable kernel
series?   (ok, 2.6 is not stable, but I assume the intention is to make
it stable eventually, and accepting new functionality does not help this
process - all in all I do not understand the raid10 submission at all,
but I hope to be enlightened by someone (Neil?))
Also, I'd love to add a mention of raid10 in the HOWTO, but I need to
know why raid10 even exists before I can reasonably do that.
