Ok, for the hcd you are right. And yes, I'd prefer to see the hcd's use 
count getting increased with any interface claimed by an usb client 
driver...
With lsmod reporting use count ==0 people might assume the module is 
unused and thus rmmod - not much fun if this is beneath a mounted fs.

PS: I've just tried this - it's even worse: not only would I expect fs 
damage, the box is OOPSing and BUGging like hell :-(
I'll take this to linux-usb-devel.
