I am trying to set up a Linux box as a bridge that will limit
throughput (and maybe even introduce delays in forwarding). I
am running 2.2.16-22 (RedHat 7.0). I have bridging working
between two lan cards.
I thought maybe I could limit transmit speed on one lan card
with shaper0 and limit the transmit speed of the other lan
card as shaper1.
When I try to configure shaper1 I get a "no such device"
message. The shaper.c source code shows shaper0-3. Should
there be a shaper1?
Can I shape two cards on the same machine? If so how?
If not, should I configure two machines as bridges and shape
one card in each machine?
Should the shaper code work with the bridging code?
Should I not use shaper at all? Maybe I should use CBQ?
Thanks in advance.
