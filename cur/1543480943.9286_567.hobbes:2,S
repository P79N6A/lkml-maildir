As another data point... I have found that turning off auto-load-images 
(under Edit|Preferences|Advanced) causes Netscape 4.5 to hang reliably.  
(I'm curious if it has this effect in 4.51.)  For a reliable failure, 
turn off autoload-images, purge caches, shut down and restart, and then 
load

 .
When Netscape hangs, I SIGSEGV it so that Netscape will get the 
Full Circle reports.  Who knows, maybe they pay some attention.
I've had reports that this failure happens with libc5 and libc6,
kernels 2.0.x and 2.1.x, and Netscape 4.0.x and 4.5.  Some people
report they can load the file above OK on their systems.
Apologies for the off-topic post.
