Nanosecond latencies and disturbingly high throughput are already 
possibly today :)  Consider the battery-backed RAM gadgets that present 
themselves as ATA devices, or nbd over 10gige network.
In fact I'm about to strip down drivers/scsi/sata_promise.c to a driver 
that just talks to the DIMM, and another else:  drivers/block/pdc_mem.c. 
  At that point you're really just looking at the PCI bus and RAM limits...
