Subject: default minimum MTU 552?

Hello,
I was looking for some more information about the minimum MTU setting of
552 for path MTU discovery, but couldn't find anything why it is exactly
552, and not, like one would expect, 576, aside of the fact that the ppp
example configs mysteriously suggest also an MTU of 552...
So, why 552? And is there a standard?
Regards,
Uwe
