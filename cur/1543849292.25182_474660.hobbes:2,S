Well, logically for any given .config a set of all kernel header files
define a set of typedefs, structs, functions and so on.
If only we can read and parse them just once, and then reuse
already parsed information when we compile each .c file -
that will give you the biggest time savings.
gcc has some facility for that ("precompiled headers")
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Precompiled-Headers.html
I don't know how hard it will be to adapt build system to using that
and there is a danger that using this thing will increase
recompile times when you change just a few CONFIG_XXXs.
