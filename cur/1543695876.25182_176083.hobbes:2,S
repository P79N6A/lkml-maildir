Hi Ville,
do you have the ability to reboot this beast on a DOS floppy equiped with a
disk editor or even debug ? It would tell you wether it's the IDE
initialization or shutdown which harms the disks. BTW, it may even be your
bios which believes for an unknown reason that it has to write to the
partition table which is not one.
just my 2 cents,
Willy
