i dont think maintainers are bad at doing this - the problem and overhead 
is on the submission side: the logistics of spreading dozens of very small 
commits out to dozens of maintainers - each of who prefers a different 
submission channel.
We have no automation for that (to make sure there's guaranteed progress 
and to make sure there's no lost patch) and hence it's simply neither 
efficient nor reliable to do it.
These particular commits seem rather uncontroversial - and they are not 
part of some bigger facility so they are individually revertable as well. 
Worst-case they break the build somewhere or cause a raised maintainer 
eyebrow - we'll try to make sure that no such thing happens on a larger 
scale.
