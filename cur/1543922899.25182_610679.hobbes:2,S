That's all true but irrelevant.  That error return isn't propagated
back to userspace when it runs modprobe (and in fact it *can't* be
sanely returned to userspace -- what do you do if the probe function
succeeds for two devices and fails for a third?).  So there's not
really any way for userspace to loop through a list of modules until
one succeeds.
