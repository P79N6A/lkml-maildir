Linus' suggested... improvement should either be done in all 3 places or none ;)
Since you're the maintainer... what's your suggestion?

boot UUID is nice in that it's different each boot, so that an oops that happens twice will have a
different UUID even if it's the same machine, while repeat-reports of the same oops will have
the same UUID. So I very much like to use some form of UUID; since the boot UUID has the
same properties I was happy to share this; if it gets too ugly or evil code wise I can always
pick something else ;-)
