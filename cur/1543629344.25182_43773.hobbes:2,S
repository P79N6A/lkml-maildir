I don't know if this is the right place for my question. In advance, i'm
sorry to bother if this is don't covered for this list. If was a better
place for this question, please show me. I can't find this topic in the
mailing list archives. Thanks.
How is the maximum memory address space, per process or for all process,
using High Memory Suport to 64Gb? Is possible to alocate more than 3GB
for one process? Is much diference between kernel 2.4.x and 2.5.x in the
high memory support?
Thanks in advance for any help.
