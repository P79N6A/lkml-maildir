Hi,
	Can any one tell me why the red, green, blue
entires in color map ( fb_cmap ) is 16 bit??
	Generally the size of hardware registers are 8 bit.
	Can there be different color maps for different
consoles??
	If i am using DIRECT_COLOR , what should be my color
map. 
	Is there any way, we can say not to use color map and
use directly the values sent to frame buffer. 
	Please reply for all these questions.
Thanks In advance,
