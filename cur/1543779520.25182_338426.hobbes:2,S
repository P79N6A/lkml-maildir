Hi Marcelo, 
Another fix from 2.6.12.3 that seems approprite for 2.4.
Should apply cleanly to your tree.

  [PATCH] v4l cx88 hue offset fix
  
  Changed hue offset to 128 to correct behavior in cx88 cards.  Previously,
  setting 0% or 100% hue was required to avoid blue/green people on screen.
  Now, 50% Hue means no offset, just like bt878 stuff.
