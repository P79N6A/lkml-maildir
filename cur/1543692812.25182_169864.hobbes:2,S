Sorry, I don't mean to imply core vserver is all new, just reacting to
one of the justifciations being "people are planning future
functionality."

Glad to hear it.  I haven't looked closely at vserver since about 2.4.14,
but I had hoped to find ways to minimize the vserver patch by reusing
some of the LSM infrastructure.  The biggest issue was the ability to
virtualize the results of something like the hostname to be ctx
specific, which was deemed too much to do for the LSM interfaces.

I _think_ this can be done with /proc/[pid]/attr/.  This allows you to
set the security attributes of a process.  IIRC, the sys_s_new_context
was something helpers would run before execve'ing a process into the new
context (sorry if my details are off).  Same can be acheived with
/proc/[pid]/attr/exec, but writing the new context to that file, then
execve'ing.  Here's a link with more details on the API:
