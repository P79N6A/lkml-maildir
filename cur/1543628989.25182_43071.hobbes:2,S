I think you should post a more specific "this vs. that" comparison.
Guessing...
If you refer to:
- No hypethreading, box sees 2 processors, performance is 100%
- Hyperthreading active, box sees 4 processors, perf is _only_ 130%,
  instead of 200%.
that is perfectly true. Each hyperthreaded pair of processors does
not perform like 2 independent ones, the share cache and other internal
things. So the usual performance improvement on a FOster Xeon is not
200%, but in the order of that 130% you get. Hyperthreading is like
'poor man' SMP.
But perhaps you alredy know all this and your question was following
other paths...
I will put my hands on a dual Xeon SuperMicro system, and will make
more tests, in a week or so...
Hope this helps.
