Hi,
I've been playing with user-mode linux (2.4.0-pre9).  It works well on
one machine, but on my laptop I'm consistently getting stack overflows
just as init is started.
The backtrace (from a breakpoint at panic()):
(gdb) bt

This is a pretty deep stack, but there's nothing unexpected there.
I would guess that some kind of very fast disk drive would also cause
this kind of deep stack on real hardware, if it can complete the
I/O and interrupt before the reschedule.
I tried adding some inlines to make the stack use a little shallower, but
it didn't help.
Any suggestions on how to get this working? 
Thanks,
