right now, EFI page size is 4096:
  include/linux/efi.h:#define EFI_PAGE_SHIFT          12
i doubt we'll ever change PAGE_SIZE on x86 - ia64's variable lowlevel 
pagesizes are not particularly useful IMO. I think we'll at most have 
some generic kernel feature that allows a larger PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT - but 
on the lowlevel MMU level we'll always stay at 4K.
and i doubt EFI_PAGE_SHIFT would want to (ever) go away from 12 either. 
So perhaps, at least as far as arch/x86/kernel/efi*.c files go, it would 
be cleaner to just replace EFI_PAGE_SHIFT with PAGE_SHIFT and 
EFI_PAGE_SIZE with PAGE_SIZE?
