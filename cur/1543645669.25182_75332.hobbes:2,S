Any reason why page table swapping wouldn't deliver just as much bang
for the buck?  Same argument re VM changes.
Anyway, I don't necessarily buy the VM change argument.  I've already
established that turning sharing off either at compile time or run
time is trivial, so there is no element of risk.  I'd suggest: take
a deep breath, relax, go slow and get it right.
What we should be coding right now is the patch Linus already asked
for, to recover page table pages as soon as possible instead of in
clear_page_tables.  With that in place the locking for shared page
tables gets a lot nicer, as Linus showed.
