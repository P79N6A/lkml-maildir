You mean "submit a urb and be notified when it was completed?"  I
thought libusb supported that with signals.

What other way can a userspace library do this?  It doesn't take very
long at all, what is the problem with this?

Remember that sysfs is "1 value per file".  If that works for your
device, then I suggest you look at the usbled driver, as that is a tiny
usb driver that only uses sysfs.  Nothing like a 4kb kernel driver :)
