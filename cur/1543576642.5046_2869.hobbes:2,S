I wouldn't (not going to here;) spend a lot of time on it.  The compiler
has problems.  It won't build glibc-2.2, and chokes horribly on ipchains.
int ipt_register_table(struct ipt_table *table)
{
	int ret;
	struct ipt_table_info *newinfo;
	static struct ipt_table_info bootstrap
		= { 0, 0, { 0 }, { 0 }, { } };
                               ^
