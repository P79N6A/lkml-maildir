For what it is worth, you are welcome.  I find it strange that
the patch (assuming you applied ...new... and then recompiled
your kernel with 'use tsc' off) made it worse.  At that point,
the kernel should not be using the TSC at all.
I wonder if using the TSC partially corrects some other
underlying flaw.
<shrug>  I think I'm out of my league here but if there's
anything I can do to help, let me know.
