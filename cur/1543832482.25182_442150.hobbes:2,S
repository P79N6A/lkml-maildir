In this case (and not only this). Of course. But not always.

For spinlocks, yes.
For other things... Sometimes you need a barrier for the compiler
only. Sometimes you don't need any general barrier, you only need
to make sure a single variable isn't being cached (by the compiler).
That's what volatile is for.
Saying that volatile is always wrong looks to me like saying that goto
is always wrong :-) And yes, there are people who say that every single
goto in the universe is wrong.
