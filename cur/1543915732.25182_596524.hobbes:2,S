I find it a bit disconcerting that blackfin already depends on this
in-tree without there being any earlier discussion on making these
changes.

I don't much care for this API. It's shuffling around a temporary
variable for the architecture code that's set for certain relocations
that are otherwise unhandled.
Since all the architecture is interested in is the relval that has
associated "persistent" data encoded in it, why don't we just have a stub
to give the architecture a chance to validate the relval before the
flat_get_relocate_addr() and move this stuff there instead? ie, blackfin
takes this out-of-line and manages its persistent value there.

There's no reason for this to be a pointer. The current in-tree blackfin
code doesn't change this value, and if you have patches that are doing
that, this is even more reason to bury this kind of silliness in your
architecture code.
load_flat_file() is ugly enough without dumping more architecture
callback abuses in it.
