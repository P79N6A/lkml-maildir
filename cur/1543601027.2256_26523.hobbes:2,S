I believe I may be onto something, but I need some test
data from people who both are seeing crashes when the
athlon memcopy is used, and without.
Boot with a kernel that doesn't cause crashes
(Ie, no athlon optimisations)
The info I need can be displayed using my x86info
tool, available from  ..
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/davej/x86info/x86info-1.5.tgz
x86info -m is the important info here. You'll need the
cpuid/msr drivers installed, /dev/cpu nodes set up, and
you'll need to run it as root.
Mail the reports directly to me, rather than flooding
the mailing list with these reports.
x86info -m | mail davej@suse.de -s "Athlon bugdata"
would be just fine.
Any findings will be summarised and reported back
to the list.
regards,
Dave.
