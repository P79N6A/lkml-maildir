No, I am saying with luck it will be in the next RH release.

Good :)

It is racey to do this, so its something that should remain a hack and
not part of taskset, I think.
If you do it in rc.d, you don't need to set all the parents. rc.d is the
first thing run, so if you do it at the top of the script, nothing else
is running. Just put:
	taskset <mask> 1
	taskset <mask> $$
at the top of rc.d.
Another consideration is modifying init (and hopefully having said
changes merged back). Init could call sched_setaffinity() when it is
first created, based on a setting in /etc/inittab or a command line
parameter passed during boot.
My reservation is against doing it in the kernel. I do not particularly
care _how_ its done in user-space.
