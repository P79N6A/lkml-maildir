You can use procmail to filter your mail VERY easily.  Penalizing
an entire list of 7000 people or more just because 3 people can't
use a sane modern mail reader is just senseless.
This filters linux-kernel into the folder LINUX-KERNEL
cat >> ~/.procmailrc <<EOF
:0:
* ^X-Mailing-List:.*linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
* ^Sender:.*linux-kernel-owner@vger
LINUX-KERNEL
EOF
That said, and while we're on the topic.. Does anyone have a
*PERFECT* recipe for procmail to REMOVE the stupid [Dummy] things
most GNU mailman lists and others prepend to the subject?
xpert@xfree86.org is one such list and I have given up on
complaining to list maintainers of other lists to change this,
and would rather fix it on my end once than complain to others.
I asked on procmail-list and got some feedback but it didn't give
me a useable filter..
Any help appreciated..
