Hello, all
I look through code of exist CANbus drivers, and have, may be strange, 
next question:
Anyone could told me, why everyone, who wrote CANbus driver (peak, 
kvaser etc) always use char dev, but not netdev for it? May be exist 
some global pitfall, which I couldn't see, which prevent to use netdev?
