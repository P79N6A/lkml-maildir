I highly suggest using ketchup for your kernel patching needs:
http://www.selenic.com/ketchup/
Here, I have a plain 2.6.11 kernel that I upgrade to 2.6.11.4.  I then
want it to go right to 2.6.11.6.  
dave@kernel:~/temp/linux-2.6.11$ ketchup 2.6.11.4
2.6.11 -> 2.6.11.4
Applying patch-2.6.11.4.bz2
dave@kernel:~/temp/linux-2.6.11$ ketchup 2.6.11.6
2.6.11.4 -> 2.6.11.6
Applying patch-2.6.11.4.bz2 -R
Applying patch-2.6.11.6.bz2
dave@kernel:~/temp/linux-2.6.11$
BTW, it also keeps a cache of local patches, and downloads if needed.
So, you'll see the downloads the first time that you use it for any
given patch.
Does that help?
