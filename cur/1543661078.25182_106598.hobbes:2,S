Sorry, this then adds to the ac97 codec list the fm801, which has a ac97 
codec on it, and takes it from being "unknown" to "known".
The forte driver uses the ac97codec code; with this, ac97_probe_codec 
registers it correctly as Forte Media, and not unknown.
No, it doesn't change the codec_ops - it just gets codec->name correct. 
  Yea, it is comestic, but some mixers didn't like it having a name of 
"Unknown".
Better?
