Good day!
Today I've learnt a nice lesson that thou shalt not use Linux to record
sound on. (Just a phrase to get you more interested... Here's the story)
My friend and I was to record some old LP records and burn the wave file
onto cd-r discs...
This machine is running 2.2.1 with a 3 years old SB AWE 32 value. 64MB ram
and one k6-166 cpu.
We started by trying to record with xwave2, but the darn thing
kept seg faulting when using 44.1KHz 16 bits stereo (the other
configurations worked mostly OK, but since we need this configuration...).
We tried yarec too, the result was the same...
I thought there was some problem with the memory, perhaps the disc wasn't
fast enough to sync with the filecache or even worse that the filecache
wasn't able to cope with the stream from the soundboard... But xosview
prooved us wrong (we think). 
A few hours later I came up with the idea that perhaps the sound drivers
were somewhat corrupt, I've never found the sound drivers 100% stable. So
we upgraded the kernel to 2.2.1-ac7, which led to same results. So we
downgraded to 2.0.36. Basically it worked now, xwave2 didn't seg fault
after 15 seconds. Yarec worked too, but there was some nasty holes in the
music. 
But after recording, (there's some heavy disc IO), we could barely play
and we'd see messages like "Couldn't allocate DMA buffer", "Unable to
open /dev/dsp" and sometimes "Sound: Recording overrun". Which also led to
that xwave2 was instable, it basically crashed when we sometimes wanted to
play the wave file. If we waited for a while it'd allow us to play. 
All these strange stuff plus the lack of energy and oxygene made the
process of recording 4 LP records and burning them onto 2 cds (the burning
part was smooth) 7-8 hours... 
This is probably a pretty lame bug report but I can't do any better.
My problems are probably due to a somewhat torn soundboard plus somewhat
corrupt device drivers, it worked somewhat in 2.0.x. Any other ideas
and/or experiences? 
The keyword is "somewhat". 
And if you answer, please send the answer to me (kalle@sslug.dk).
Thanks! (although I must say i'm not really in that kind of mood, it's
about 5.30 am now...)
