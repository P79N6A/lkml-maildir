This is one of the most annoying 'features' of netscape. I could be looking
through my mail folders then suddenly netscape freezes up and the modem dials
out. Just because someone mailed me a URL. The computer should never, ever dial
out to get an attachment unless I tell it to. Of course this is just one rubbish
Netscape feature among many. It's got to the point where I have frequent lurid
fantasies about the Netscape development team suffering eternally in hell.
