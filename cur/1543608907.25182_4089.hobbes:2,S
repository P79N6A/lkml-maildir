I can see that you are unfamiliar with the /proc filesystem.
You can change kernels because app developers work hard to
be tolerant of stupid /proc changes. Some of the crap that
I've stumbled across, mostly while doing procps work:
/proc/*/stat signal info was changed from decimal to hex for
a while. I changed it back, but too late: the evil hex had
already leaked out into the world, and I had to modify libproc.
Quick, is 16785472 in decimal or hex? So use the "friendly" new
/proc/*/status file instead, but...
The "SigCgt" in /proc/*/status wasn't always spelled that way.
It wasn't always in the same location either, so what to do?
That calls for another hack: assume signal values follow each other.
Kernel threads don't have memory info. Somebody added "kB" on the
end of most lines in /proc/meminfo. /proc/stat has changed in ways
that I'm glad to have forgotten. /proc/interrupts has been through
a flood of horrid changes: the PIC type going from "" to "XT PIC"
to "XT-PIC", the last column getting spaces (consider "XT PIC"!),
a new header (just waiting for extra info) and a variable number
of per-CPU columns in the middle to replace what was once a total.
Maybe /proc/cpuinfo is the worst... I hear SPARC is pretty smelly,
but hey, every arch screws app developers in some unique way.
