Hi, here I am.  I hadn't resubscribed to the list after it switched from
rutgers.  Sheesh, I leave you guys alone for five minutes and you go off 
and rewrite BitKeeper.  I should give you all jobs :-)

I'm going to have to respectfully disagree.  First of all, having a flag 
day where everyone switches to BK just isn't a realistic expectation, 
even if the license wasn't an issue.  Things just don't work that way and
you are saying, I think, that BK is only useful if everyone switches.  I
don't think that people who are using BK would agree with that statement.
You can use BK to track what Linus releases easily and nicely.  In fact,
the trees at BitMover, made by the FSMlab crew (Cort and PPC friends), 
are just that.  Cort worked up some scripts to deal with the fact that
pre-patches are different from release patches, but other than that, 
tracking the Linus releases has been trivial.
Putting stuff back from BK into Linus' tree is another matter.  It would
be a lot easier if Linus maintained a BK tree and generated the traditional
patches and/or release tarballs from that tree.  There are some issues 
with file creates that BK doesn't handle well which would go away if there
was a definitive BK tree that Linus used.  We hope that that will happen,
but even if it does, you don't have to use BK if you don't like it, or 
the license, or you just think I'm a big boogerhead.  If Linus had a
BK tree, he can just export the patches from it, each changeset is in
essence a patch.
