This would be a useful extension for other architectures also, if/when
they convert to doing likewise.
I actually favored making C language spin_lock() (i.e. the goddamn
thing is declared as a C function void spin_lock(spinlock_t *) and is
called like a normal C function -- no inline asm or inline C functions
at all) entrypoints beyond merely conslidating contention loops, but I
feared that would be too extreme of a reversal of the status quo to
ever get traction to post it. It did, however, shrink the kernel text
the most of any of the out-of-line spinlock patches by a large margin,
something completely absurd-sounding, like 220KB vs. 20KB-60KB. =)
