Well, I followed some of the instructions to mirror the kernel tree on
svn.clkao.org/linux/cvs, and although it took around 12 hours to import
28232 versions, I seem to have a mirror of it on my own subversion
server now. I think the svn.clkao.org mirror was taken from bkcvs... the
last log message I see is "Rev 28232 - torvalds - 2005-04-04 09:08:33"
I have no idea what's missing. What is everyone's favorite web frontend
to subversion? I've got websvn (debian package) on there now, and it's a
bit sluggish, but it seems to work.
I hope to have time this week or next to actually make this machine
publicly accessible.
