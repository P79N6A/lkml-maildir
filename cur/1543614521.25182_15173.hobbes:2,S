Hmm.. That might work, but at the same time I suspect that the most
fanatic embedded users are actually the ones that may benefit most from
ramfs in the first place. That was certainly why it came to be..
We'll see. We'll end up using ramfs for the initial init bootup (ie the
"tar.gz->ramfs" stage of bootup), so making it __init may not be practical
for other reasons. We'd have to unload it not after the __init stage, but
after the first root filesystem is unused (which may be later, depending
on what people put in the filesystem).
