Where can I find this FCC law that seems to be crippling open source 
wlan development?
I am not from the USA, so I don't have to comply with the FCC. Could we 
make a non-crippled totally open source driver for use by people outside 
the USA?
For example, here in the UK one can own radios that can transmit on any 
frequency one likes, but if you actually press the TX button without a 
the appropriate License, you break the law.
