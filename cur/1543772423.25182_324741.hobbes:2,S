Well, which sound level shall be set instead? 100%? Maybe too loud for
my 500 watt loudpeakers, eh? 50%? Still too many. 5%? Nah.
My machine at work has a headphone which is anything but loud.
5% is nearly silence for it.
See? It's not a kernel matter at which volume sound must be set.
It is impossible to decide on the 'right' default.

Or laptop oriented distro can have a script for you,
just like they already do have for DHCPizing all ifaces.
Not kernel business.

Users which can not figure it by themself have not much power in dictating
how kernel drivers are written. Sure we listen to users, but we won't
blidly follow any and all suggestions.
If users want it different nodoby prohibits them from writing their own
drivers, right? Or patching existing ones, for that matter. Send patches to lkml
for discussion.
