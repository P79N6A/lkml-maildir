BTW, I just noticed that _PAGE_PWT has been folded into _PAGE_PCD.  This 
seems like a really bad idea to me, since it breaks the rule that 
_PAGE_X == 1 << _PAGE_BIT_X.  I can't think of a specific place where 
this would cause problems, but this kind of non-uniformity always ends 
up biting someone in the arse.
I think having a specific _PAGE_NOCACHE which combines these bits is a 
better approach.
