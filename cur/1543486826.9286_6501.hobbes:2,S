I have a Huston Jumperless PCI motherboard on a non-laptop (it's a
70-pound tower case, about as far from a laptop you can get and still
have the machine fit under a desk ;-) with a SoundBlaster 16 (OEM) card.
Kernel 2.2.0-pre6 (but this has happened on all of the 2.1.x series since
112 or so), Red Hat 5.2 for everything else.  I get the IRQ/DRQ config
error when recording audio (this machine almost never plays audio,
it is an FM radio to ethernet converter 24 hours a day).  
Usually there are 3 error messages at a time when the problem occurs.
The errors occurred in 164 of the last 720 hours (I'd have to go home and
muck around with CD-R's to get data from before then).  They usually occur
at specific times past the start of the hour, which suggests that there
is some kind of interaction with something else running on the machine.
However, the relative offset into each hour when the error occurs is
drifting by 10 seconds per day or so.
As far as I know another Soundblaster16 is working just fine with the same
kernel revisions, and this SB16 also worked before the motherboard was
installed.  I've never tested the soundcard/motherboard combination with
2.0.36, but I know the soundcard worked in another motherboard with 2.0.xx
for years.
I currently work around this by hacking up 'srec' to close and re-open the
device if it gets a sound I/O error.
/etc/conf.modules contains:
	alias sound-slot-0 sb
	options sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1
rpm -q glibc gcc binutils says:
	glibc-2.0.7-29
	gcc-2.7.2.3-14
	binutils-2.9.1.0.15-1

My working theory is that the motherboard is simply broken.  The realtime
clock on this motherboard has drifted out of sync with realtime by
4 hours 30 minutes since the machine was last rebooted 20 days ago,
and I've had enough problems with sound cards and motherboards under
several I386 operating systems to believe that the first thing to go on a
marginal motherboard is the sound card.  I bought the thing as temporary
replacement for a good motherboard that emitted smoke, and when the
permanent replacement for the good motherboard showed up a few days later
I put the problem board into this machine where it has been ever since.
