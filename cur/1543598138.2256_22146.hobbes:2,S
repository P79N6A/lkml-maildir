Hi,
I've just bought a ECS K7S5A motherboard with this chipset on, and it seems 
to work pretty well so far.  The sound doesn't seem to be supported at 
the moment, but the IDE, USB, and Ethernet(*) seem to be.  I've had a few
'status=0x58' errors when doing some heavy disk activity, but apparently
this can be solved by a kernel option ('use multimode by default') which
I'm about to try (note: these errors only occur when using UDMA as far as I
can tell).  If that doesn't fix it I'll put a question to this list...
The AGP can also be made to work by using 'agp_try_unsupported=1' as a
module/kernel argument.  I'm currently updated the PCI.IDS file and the known
AGP chipset list to include the 735, but I'm checking that the AGP works
fully first.
Cheers,
Adrian.
(*) I can't test the Ethernet properly, but doing 'insmod sis900' works ok,
and the status info it comes back with as it initialises looks reasonable.
Any more than that, I can't verify.
