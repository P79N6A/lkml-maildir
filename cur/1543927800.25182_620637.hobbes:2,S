Ingo,
Just applied this patch to 2.6.22.13 and 2.6.22.14. Compiles and runs fine but
on my laptop, it prevents suspending and hibernating with "one tasks refuses to
freeze" load_balance_mo.
Reverting back to sched-cfs-2.6.22.9-v22 solves this problem. If you need more
details, CC me with a reply as I lurk on the mailing list every 2 days or so.

Durand
