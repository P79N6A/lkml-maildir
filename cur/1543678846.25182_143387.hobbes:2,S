registers simply buffer the address and control signals going to and from
a module. On server boards the issue has more to do with trace length and
electrical loading than anything else... One of the issues you encounter
on server boards more than elsewere is larger more complicated memory
modules things like 36 chip double stack ecc 1 and 2gb dimms, or a large 
number of dimm modules overall (like 4-8 slots rather than 1-4).

  In Dr. Johnson's famous dictionary patriotism is defined as the last
  resort of the scoundrel.  With all due respect to an enlightened but
  inferior lexicographer I beg to submit that it is the first.
