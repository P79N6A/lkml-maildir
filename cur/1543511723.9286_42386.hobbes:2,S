I have developed a module allowing mapping in user space memory allocated in
the kernel with vmalloc. This may be used for example for communication with 
real time kernel tasks. 
The module is available on
http://crds.chemie.unibas.ch/PCI-MIO-E/mbuff-0.6pre7.tar.gz
I would like to request a minor number for this device.
Major 10 (misc)
\minor{to be assigned}{/dev/mbuff}{Allocate and mmap vmalloc'ed memory}
This is a character device driver, implementing mmap and 3 ioctl for
allocation, query, and deallocation of memory blocks identified with names
(max 32 bytes).
