Yep, I have seen this too. Sync took *way* too long and I believe I
lost some data because of this problem.

I guess you should not try to wake up process while it is frozen. Such
wakeups are likely to get lost. Should we add some BUG_ON() somewhere?
...we have to eat some wakeups, because we fake some.
Or perhaps we should do WARN_ON(frozen(current)) just after schedule()
below?

Refrigerator looks like this:
/* Refrigerator is place where frozen processes are stored :-). */
void refrigerator(void)
{
        /* Hmm, should we be allowed to suspend when there are
realtime
           processes around? */
        long save;
        save = current->state;
        pr_debug("%s entered refrigerator\n", current->comm);
        printk("=");
        frozen_process(current);
        spin_lock_irq(&current->sighand->siglock);
        recalc_sigpending(); /* We sent fake signal, clean it up */
        spin_unlock_irq(&current->sighand->siglock);
        while (frozen(current)) {
                current->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
                schedule();
        }
        pr_debug("%s left refrigerator\n", current->comm);
        current->state = save;
}
