It changes at least tso_segs, since if you decrease of increase the
size of the payload the number of real TCP/IP packets the TSO engine
will end up spitting out could be different.
The one netfilter module I'm most concerned about is the one that
handles non-passive FTP, I remember that one did strange things with
the data stream, removed TCP options, and stuff like that.

As mentioned above, I thought the netfilter module handling non-passive
FTP stripped TCP options.

This may be what I was thinking about.

Currently all the TSO supporting drivers set the ip and tcp header
checksum values themselves as appropriate, so there are no worries in
this area.
