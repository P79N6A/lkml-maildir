Question is: should we fix it?  I'm not aware of any bug reports against
this behaviour, and there is the possibility that changing it now will
break some applications.
Yes, those applications are presumably broken on other OS's but that's
different.
Given that this has been a longstanding misbehaviour in Linux (yes?) maybe
the most prudent path is to remain bug-compatible?
I'll add the patch to -mm so we can pick up any obvious userspace breakage,
but it is likely that such problems will take a long time to emerge.

So are you saying that in this case access() is, in effect, returning
	access(file, MAY_READ) || access(file, MAY_EXEC)
whereas it should be returning
	access(file, MAY_READ) && access(file, MAY_EXEC)
?
