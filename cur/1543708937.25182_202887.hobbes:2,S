| What is this driver for?  Where can I find it?
The nokia c110 is a prism2-based wireless lan card that does not
work with the normal prism driver because it has a different controller
and a big pile of extra unneeded and unsupported stuff like a smartcard
reader...
Available here:

Thanks...I'll try that...however I just realized I don't even have a
linux driver for the pci to pcmcia cradle that it's supposed to work
with (i82365-compatible PCI card support was dropped from the kernel
driver and pcmcia-cs driver won't build if there is pcmcia support in
the kernel and the whole package won't compile without pcmcia support in
the kernel...)
Therefore, I won't be able to test this until I get a laptop in use in
two weeks time...
