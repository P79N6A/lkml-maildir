I wasn't quite sure why this would be so hard, so I took a look.  Here's
how it works:
In fs/ext2/super.c, we do:
        if (test_opt(sb, ERRORS_RO)) {
                printk("Remounting filesystem read-only\n");
                sb->s_flags |= MS_RDONLY;
        }
From here on, the VFS handles returning -EROFS (except for a couple
of ioctls and an xattr call).  So it's not under the control of the
individual filesystem.  One way of handling this would be to introduce a
new MS_ERRORS flag that allows the VFS to return -EIO instead of -EROFS
for a filesystem that contains errors.
