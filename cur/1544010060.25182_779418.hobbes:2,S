How does the struct's size impact their cache utilisation then?

Sorry, actually, it's not VIDIOC_DQBUF where we have to free buffer(s), 
it's VIDIOC_STREAMOFF. And in a normal case there are no more completion 
interrupts, no allocation requests, and noone is interested in 
is_tx_complete. Normally you would just get a dma_release_channel after 
that. Or, of course, the application may decide to restart capture, then 
we get requests, completions, etc. again. So, yes, I could do this, it 
just seems a bit unnatural to me.

Sure it can... Ok, so, the decision is - a garbage-collection tasklet? Ok, 
will do this.
