    hi guys, the mentioned patch idea is a great one,
  i think, in the light of the situation with only
  512 Mb RAM cached with P2 (as mentioned above)...
  at least detection of uncached RAM is a must.
  should anybody port the patch to 2.4?
(there is still alot of people which use PI`s...),
and using uncached RAM as swap actually will increase
spped, rather than decrease it...
though, there is an other solution: 
allocate the tail as zones marked slow.
comments people?

cheers,
