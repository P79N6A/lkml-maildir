Perhaps it's worth noting that of those 2.2 GB in use, 1.5 GB are used 
as cache; seems to me there's no leak, your system is just caching as 
much data as it can in memory. The actual memory in use (check with 
'free') is total-(buffers+cache)= 2.2-(0.37+1.51)GB=about 320 MB, which 
seems reasonable enough
