All you need to do is to make the CPU capable of running the kernel
(well, some of it), but it doesn't have to be particularly good at
running anything but the TCP/IP code. And you can still benefit
from most of the features of NPUs, such as a specialized memory
architecture, parallel data paths, accelerated operations, etc.
