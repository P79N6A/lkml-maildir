if you want reliable delivery, then you cant just depend on async events
from the kernel -> user - which i am assuming is the way stats get
delivered as processes exit? Sorry, i dont remember the details. You
need some synchronous scheme to ask the kernel to do a "get" or "dump".
Lets be clear about one thing:
The problem really has nothing to do with gen/netlink or any other
scheme you use;->
It has everything to do with reliability implications and the fact
that you need to assume memory is a finite resource - at one point
or another you will run out of memory ;-> And of course then messages
will be lost.  So for gen/netlink, just make sure you have large socket
buffer and you would most likely be fine. 
I havent seen how the numbers were reached: But if you say you receive
14K exits/sec each of which is a 50B message, I would think a 1M socket
buffer would be plenty.
You can find out about lack of memory in netlink when you get a ENOBUFS.
As an example, you should then do a kernel query. Clearly if you do a
query of that sort, you may not want to find obsolete info. Therefore,
as a suggestion, you may want to keep sequence numbers of sorts as
markers. Perhaps keep a 32-bit field which monotically increases per
process exit or use the pid as the sequence number etc..
As for throttling - Shailabh, I think we talked about this:
- You could maintain info using some thresholds and timer. Then
when a timer expires or threshold is exceeded send to user space.
BTW, where is the doc fixes ? ;->
cheers,
