> e1000 has a VLAN filter type on-chip, which complicates things a tiny bit.
The filtering is separate from the tagging.  Filtering lets the hardware
ignore tagged packets for VLANs that it's not a member of.  The vlan_group
structure isn't well laid out for this, but it would be possible to search
for non-NULL values in the vlan_devices array to get the VLAN IDs for
filtering.  The driver would need to know when new VLAN IDs were added to
the group.
