Hi Matt, Alan, 
  Could you please tell me (link would do) why it makes default
delay_use=5 
really necessary (from the patch below)?

It makes USB boot really painfull and slow :(
  I understand there should be a good reason for it. I've tried to find
an answer in 
archives, without much success though.
Thanks,
Aleks.
