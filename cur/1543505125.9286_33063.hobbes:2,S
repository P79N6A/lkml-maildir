It is not my suggestion. It is evident that ip_build_xmit is useless
for IPsec. Just look at it, factor out fragmentation code and you will see,
that it reduces to several lines of the dumbest code.

Exactly. If you use virtual devices, you will have whole
bucket of silly problems. Certainly, the way to workaround all them exists,
look at another virtual devices (teql, shaper). If you will be enough
accurate you will stop to see all those miracles, which you said above 8)
But it is way to nowhere. Do not try to invent the wheel, just follow
specs. All the construction is described in details in IPsec docs, actually
we have nothing to add to them without reducing functionality.
Well, take as example any other IPsec implementation.
