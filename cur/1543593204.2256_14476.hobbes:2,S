Fine. Can you think of a default value for expiring cache ?

Is not better. Well, when somebody is playing against you, you're in
trouble either way:
- rate limit: - blocking - as above
              - non-blocking - notify the user that you can't get the info
                and probably stop or aquire elevated priviledges and try
                to restart the network
- cache: get outdated info
But when a HA application runs, it's usually preferable to stop (and you
notice it) than to continue with wrong data. Especially if you set the
cache expiry to something like 30 seconds; think in terms of how many
transactions/second today's hardware allows...

I don't argue over this point, already several people mentioned it. But I
explained the present situation in a previous message: the MII info is
normally read at a low rate and some applications need it more often. It
doesn't matter that it's delivered through ioctl, netlink or any other
way, you have to read it from the hardware and deliver to user-space at
user request. So the "doing the MII monitoring" is the tough part.
