  Ha. Too hard to do :-)
  The TOEs and L7 content switches that I know of are supported...
      UNDER LINUX ONLY 
  The one that I'm most familliar with (Seaway's SW5000/NCA2000)
provides a new socket family to the host, which corresponds to streams
that terminate on the NCA2000.  The host can request things like having
two TCP streams be cross-connected, even adding/subtracting SSL along
the way.
  This code does not interact with the Linux IP stack at all --- so it
isn't exactly a TOE. You have to, at a minimum recompile applications.
