Utility is very good for traffic generation, however, you may wish to 
consider adding a parameter
to increase tx_queue_len for the device underneath if you choose to 
inject traffic from multiple
sources into the device for testing.    With the tx_queue_len set to 
defaults, I see a lot of traffic
from above getting dropped when tests are running.   I have had to 
increase this number to
60000 to get around certain test scenarios.
Just a suggestion.
Jeff
