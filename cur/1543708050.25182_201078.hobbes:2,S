Yes, they are.

Thanks.

I don't have the ability to look at that manual right now.
Your patch uses two instructions to flush the queue (push+ret) instead
of one (jmp or ljmp).  Is that documented as reliable?  I can easily
imagine an implementation which decodes one instruction after a mode
change predictably, but not two.
I doubt that it makes a difference - we're setting PG, not changing
the instruction format - but I'd like us to be sure it cannot fail on
things like 386s and 486s, and similar non-Intel chips.
