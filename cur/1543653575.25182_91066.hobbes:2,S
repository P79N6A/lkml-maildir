As long as the kernel doesn't freeze up or leak memory, I believe it is
the responsibility of the application code to ensure that the correct
file descriptors are registered (and deregistered). If the application
code does screwy things, it should expect a little bit of undefined
behaviour.

Whether the 'fd' field is in kernel space or user space or both does
not really affect the ability of the application code to be able to
perform dup() operations without needing to change references to the
'fd'. For the people that do not wish to use the 'obj' field, the 'fd'
field will be more natural. (Anybody who dups a file descriptor, and
then tells the event loop to watch both file descriptors, is asking for
trouble under any scheme...)
