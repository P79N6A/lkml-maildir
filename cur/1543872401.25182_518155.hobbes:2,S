  Yes, the device does not share interrupt.

     I agree.but as I said our hardware will repeatedly raising
interrupts until it's serviced, the missing wakeup call would be
repeated also, so this should still wake up the sleep_on call. But we
would change it definitely.

     As pointed out by Robert, I added the checking
                   if(signal_pending(current))
                       return -ERESTARTSYS;
right after the line interruptible_sleep_on , but I don't see any
difference yet.

  Thanks for catching it

     Thanks again. But may I ask if it is prohibited, how come it has
been running without any error?

    changed.
Thank you for your input.
