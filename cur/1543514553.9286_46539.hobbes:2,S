I like this, but there's a bug.  If I do these commands, I don't
have a modules/ directory:
    make oldconfig
    make dep
    make clean
    make bzImage
    make modules
End quote.

I thought this went in ages ago. Can someone explain to me why the make
clean is done after make dep instead of before make oldconfig? I often
do a make clean after make modules_install.
