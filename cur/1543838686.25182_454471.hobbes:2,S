Subject: [PATCH 3/3] PM: Remove PM_TRACE from Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/16/302

Remove the CONFIG_PM_TRACE option, which is dangerous and should only be used
by people who know exactly what they are doing, from kernel/power/Kconfig .
