Good Day
Say i want to implement extended set of ATA commands available to
userspace for building diagnostic tools.
I need 0x40 -- read verify and 0x32 -- write long with error handling,
for example. I was trying ide driver through ioctl's, but seems it
lack of functionality and full of gotchas. Furthermore it oopses
sometimes.
Is it possible to use libata for such purpose or i need to write
separate IDE driver ?
By the way, i'm sure it should be done in kernel space since i'm going
to deal with some hdd manufacturer commands.
P.S. I was looking through libata and ide sources and documentation
but still dont have broad picture.
Thanks
