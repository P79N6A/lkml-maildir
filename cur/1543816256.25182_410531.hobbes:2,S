Subject: [PATCH 2.6.15] Adding kernel-level identd dispatcher
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/24/192

This patch adds ident daemon to net/gnuidentd/
directory.
Apply to: 2.6.15.1.
Patch is here:
http://unwd.sourceforge.net/gnuidentd-2.6.15.patch
I used two threads: one for connections handling and
another for tracking /etc/passwd changes through
inotify.
Additionally, root can set users hiding rules using
file in /proc. 
I'm awaiting your notes/tips.
