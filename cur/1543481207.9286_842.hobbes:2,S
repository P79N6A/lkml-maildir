Not true. All things that are not running with interrupts disabled can be
preempted.

Pfft. This is absurd. Every process that is blocked on I/O is _in kernel
context_. This is the way UNIX works.

And this is even more absurd. SMP is _symmetric_. Kernel runs on all
processors _by definition_. There may be some confusion here with respect
to lock granularity though. The very first SMP kernels had a single lock
that protected most data structures, which drastically limited kernel
concurrency.  Current kernels have more fine-grained locking that allow
much better concurrency and therefore better scaling.
