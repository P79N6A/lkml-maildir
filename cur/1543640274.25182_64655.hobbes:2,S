Hey no, it's cpu_gdt_table that must be aligned. That one does not matter, 
it's only used once for the lgdt instruction...
Ingo, for the layout of the gdt also, the location of the TSS descriptor
is irrelevant AFAICT. It's only used when doing the initial LTR, after 
that it's never referenced by the CPU.
