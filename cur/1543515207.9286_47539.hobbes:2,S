Sorry about a bad link.  Last night I posted well after midnight and didn't
check a link before refering to it.
   The link I posted was www.geneticprogramming.com
   THIS IS WRONG.
   It should be www.genetic-programming.com
   One of the interesting links on that site is:
   
http://www.genetic-programming.com/humancompetitive.html
Sorry.
