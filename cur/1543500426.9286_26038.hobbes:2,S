It is amazing how the sub-file issues resemble sub-process issues.
Threads could be more easily implemented as part of libc, but
performance and correctness would suffer.

I think you are proposing "solutions" to brush away the problem.

(and it must, since the system won't work otherwise)

There goes the correctness.
