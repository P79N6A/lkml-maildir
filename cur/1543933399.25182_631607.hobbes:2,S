The phrase "all or none" specifically describes the current practice in 
arch/x86/pci/mmconfig_{32,64}.c whereby a PCI bus always has one, and 
only one, access method.
So the problems you describe are unrelated to "all or none" as I was 
describing it.

False.  If you have overlapping areas, then clearly it is 
board-dependent (undefined) what happens -- you might trigger an 
mmconfig access by writel() to your PCI device's MMIO BAR space.
Consider, too, what the current code in arch/x86/pci/mmconfig_{32,64}.c 
does:  it uses the range BIOS told to use for mmconfig, no more no less.
Clearly many early mmconfig BIOSes have buggy resource allocation... 
Thus if mmconfig is not known working on a system, turn it off 100% for 
all buses.  End of story.

The existing code in arch/x86/pci/mmconfig_{32,64}.c today handles 
mixing of PCI-E and PCI-X just fine.  As noted above, its done on a 
per-bus and per-segment basis today.

The proposed API adds code, so I don't see how it simplifies things.
The current approach is quite clean anyway:
1) "raw_pci_ops" points to a single set of PCI config accessors.
2) For mmconfig, if the BIOS did not tell us to use mmconfig with a 
given PCI bus, fall back to type1 accesses.

I agree with the function as noted in response to Linus's "Sound ok with 
this plan?" email.  But note -- users and developers also need to access 
extended config space, even if driver did not request it.  Even if there 
is no driver at all.
Otherwise the value of "lspci -vvvxxx" debugging reports from users is 
diminished.
