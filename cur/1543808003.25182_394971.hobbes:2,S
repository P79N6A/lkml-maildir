Alan,
I just gave 2.6.16-rc1-mm5 a shot on my old VIA-based Duron machine,  
and everything seems to work fine. I notice PATA CD-ROMs still aren't  
being recognised (with libata.atapi_enabled=1) which is a bit of a  
shame, but fortunately I won't be needing to use the CD-ROM on this  
machine at all. In fact this machine has so little use that I'm quite  
happy to surrender it to testing.
HTH,
Chris
