Well I don't want to inhibit your hackerly fervor, but C2 and C3 handling
are already supported by the ACPI driver, in a vendor-neutral manner.
If you take a look at the code, you will notice a few things. First, it only
transitions to a deeper sleep state after doing some number of lighter
sleeps. This is to minimize the performance hit caused by C2/C3 entry and
exit latencies. Second, it only uses a given processor power state if the
system's ACPI tables indicates they can be used. If you are attempting to
use C2 even if your system explicitly does not support it, you are asking
for trouble, just like AMD's errata says.
Besides I'd think any cooling issues would occur when the CPU was 100%
utilized, yes? Why are you trying to optimize the idle loop for power when
it's not the problem? You can throttle the processor or turn a fan on to
handle a too-hot cpu, but all C2/C3 gets you is reduced power when idle.
This results in better battery life on a laptop but that is irrelevant on a
desktop system.
