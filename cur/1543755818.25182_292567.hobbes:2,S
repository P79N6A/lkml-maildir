The reason I was asking and assuming you had a 32bit kernel is that
you were quoting pieces of arch/i386/kernel/crash.c instead of
arch/x86_64/kernel/crash.c
While the functionality can easily be transfered I didn't think
any one had done that yet.

All that has to happen is to drop the x86-crash_shutdown-apic-shutdown.patch
from Andrews tree.  That patch just added the handful of lines that
disabled the apics.   Once I get a test case that someone can boot a
kernel without disabling apics I will ask Andrew to drop the above
mentioned patch.

Ok. Thanks.  This is a legitimate bug.  And it is probably the reason
I even care about the non-SMP interrupt case some days.  The problem
is that the kernel just assumes interrupts are setup in non-APIC mode
when it starts booting, and quite possibly only the bootstrap cpu can
see those interrupts. 
So I believe the fix needs to be to enable apics before we calibrate
the delay timer.  I'm not certain off the top of my head what that
patch will look like but it should not be fundamentally hard.  
With that code in place we also don't need to do any APIC shutdown
as the kernel knows enough to completely setup the apics.
