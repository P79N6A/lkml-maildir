I tested 2.4.3-pre7 and it still fails without my patch.  With my patch I
get the above message about 'Redundant entry in serial pci_table' but it
still manages to setup my serial device as /dev/ttyS4 (the same patch
applied to 2.4.2-ac21 sets the device to /dev/ttyS1).  However it only works
if I load serial.c as a module AFTER the card is inserted, if serial.c is
already loaded it doesn't register correctly with a messages similar to
above.  Perhaps I need to check my hotplug setup.
Could your try serial.c as a module and see if it works for you like that?
That way I'd know I'm on the right track and haven't just found some strange
way to make it work on my system alone.
Later,
Tom
