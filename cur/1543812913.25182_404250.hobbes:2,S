Why do you want that?
If prefetch is doing its job then it will save the machine from a pile of
major faults in the near future.  The fact that the machine happens to be
running a number of busy tasks doesn't alter that.  It's _worth_ stealing a
few cycles from those tasks now to avoid lengthy D-state sleeps in the near
future?
