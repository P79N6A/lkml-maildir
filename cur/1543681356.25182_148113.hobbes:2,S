Ouch.. But how many of these /proc tweaks need to stay there once
debugging is done? I do not like any configuration options for
swsusp... It should just work. [Okay, we probably need to have resume=
parameter.]
For 2.4.X I don't care. For official tree, it has to "just work" with
as little configuration as possible. [Besides enable_escape, what else
might user want to tweak?]
