I think the misconception that $(( ... )) is a bashism is caused by
the wrong highlighting defaults chosen by vim. To fix this add this to ~/.vimrc
let g:is_posix = 1
That will also allow you to use the $(command) POSIX construct.
BTW, the vim syntax maintainers don't agree with changing this default:
