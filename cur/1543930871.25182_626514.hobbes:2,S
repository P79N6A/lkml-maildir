Here, commented out [include/asm-x86/tsc.h]:
/* Like get_cycles, but make sure the CPU is synchronized. */
static __always_inline cycles_t get_cycles_sync(void)
{
    unsigned long long ret;
    unsigned eax, edx;
    /*
       * Use RDTSCP if possible; it is guaranteed to be synchronous
      * and doesn't cause a VMEXIT on Hypervisors
     */
    alternative_io(ASM_NOP3, ".byte 0x0f,0x01,0xf9", X86_FEATURE_RDTSCP,
               ASM_OUTPUT2("=a" (eax), "=d" (edx)),
               "a" (0U), "d" (0U) : "ecx", "memory");
    ret = (((unsigned long long)edx) << 32) | ((unsigned long long)eax);
    if (ret)
        return ret;
    /*
     * Don't do an additional sync on CPUs where we know
     * RDTSC is already synchronous:
     */
//    alternative_io("cpuid", ASM_NOP2, X86_FEATURE_SYNC_RDTSC,
//              "=a" (eax), "0" (1) : "ebx","ecx","edx","memory");
    rdtscll(ret);
    return ret;
