This looks suspicious.  8250 should need serial_core, but there's no
way in hell serial_core should require 8250. 
Seems to be caused by the kgdb patches, which add the following to
serial_core:
+#ifdef CONFIG_KGDB
+       {
+               extern int kgdb_irq;
+
+               if (port->irq == kgdb_irq)
+                       return;
+       }
+#endif
+
and kgdb_irq comes from the 8250 module.
Tom, can this dependency be solved before kgdb goes near mainline
please?
