If I understand your intentions(to capture information on function call/entry and corresponding function exit) cleary, I have few concerns on this.
1) How do you map the entry_handler(which gets executed when a process enters the function) with each instance of return probe handler.
I accept that entry_handler() will execute each time process enters the function, but to  calculate time, one needs to know corresponding instance of return probe handler(there should be a map for each return handler). 
  Let me explain briefly.
Suppose in a SMP system, 4 processes  enter the same function at almost sametime(by executing entry_hanlder()) and returns from 4 different locations by executing the return handler.  Now how do I match entry_handler() with corresponding instance of return handler for calculating time.
Sometime back, Even I was interested in calculating the  function execution time, but I used approach a) .
Now What I think is, there could be 2 solutions to these problem.
a) Collect the entry time and exit time and put it in that kretprobe_instance structure and fetch it before freeing that instance.
b) Or pass ri(kretprobe_instance address to entry_handler) and match it with return probe handler.
