I tried that. 
Known gotchas.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Certain known bugs are being reported over and over. Here are the
workarounds.
- Blank screen after decompressing kernel?
  Make sure your .config has
   CONFIG_INPUT=y
   CONFIG_VT=y
   CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
   CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
  A lot of people have discovered that taking their .config from 2.4 and
  running make oldconfig to pick up new options leads to problems, notably
  with CONFIG_VT not being set.
ok, so I grep'ed the .config
[root@eglifamily kernel]# grep -wi config_input .config
CONFIG_INPUT=y
[root@eglifamily kernel]# grep -wi config_vt .config
CONFIG_VT=y
[root@eglifamily kernel]# grep -wi config_vga_console .config
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
[root@eglifamily kernel]# grep -wi config_vt_console .config
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
[root@eglifamily kernel]#
you can see that in the .config I attched:
