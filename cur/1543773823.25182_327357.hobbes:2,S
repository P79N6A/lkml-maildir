I think you may have misread that... the latest patch at least has:

If you see anywhere our supported feature set is actually misstated, please

Generally we want to be as useful as possible, so we've got a long list of
planned features. I'd need to look more closely at the issues involved with
supporting these in a clustered environment before giving you any more

OCFS2 supports subsecond timestamps via a u32 nsec fields on dinode, so I
think at least that should work for you.
