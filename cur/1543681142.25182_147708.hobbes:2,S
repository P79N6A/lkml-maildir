There will be a more meaningful message in your system log.

This (remount,quota) is not implemented by the XFS kernel code,
and hasn't ever been, although there was a time when it wouldn't
have reported an error when attempting this.  Currently, quota
can only be enabled during the initial mount.  For your root fs
this means using "rootflags=quota" during startup.
