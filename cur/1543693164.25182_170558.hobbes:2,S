What if that signal was necessary for the operation of the thread, and
dropping it would cause a problem?
Since you're effectively using signal handling to cause a false pending
signal indication, surely the correct cleanup is to re-calculate the
pending signal indication.  That way, we won't be throwing away signals.
I'm also wondering if there could be a problem with (ab)using TASK_STOPPED
here - could a stopped task be woken prematurely and thereby sent spinning
in refrigerator() by a non-stopped process sending a SIGCONT at just the
right time?
Maybe we want a TASK_FROZEN state to describe the "frozen, may not be woken
by anything except thawing" state?
