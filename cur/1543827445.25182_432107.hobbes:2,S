Of course you do have other options.
One is to take responsibility of the mail that you forward.  I don't
necessarily mean SRS - anything that makes the mail come from a domain
which claims your server as a valid sender will do.
Another option would be to arrange with the site that you are
forwarding mail to to trust you.
Exactly what option is best for you would depend a lot on the details
of your current setup - and Zwane's.
And certainly not forwarding mail for Zwane is an option.
But there *are* multiple options.
