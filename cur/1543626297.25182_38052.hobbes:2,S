Ah, Dan - you've hit the nail on the head.  I, too, am awed by Rick's 
forward thinking.  My only hesitation is that his thinking is so far 
above and beyond the norm that I find I am unable to respond to his 
postings at the level of intelligence required to communicate with him. 
  Given the normal lack of responses to his postings, I assume that 
others must feel the same.
Perhaps his vision and leadership would spur us all on to higher order 
thinking, but I can only wonder how many of us would be able to make the 
leap.  I can only say that I would be willing to try, and hope that he 
would be as gentle towards the ignorant as Linus has been.
Besides, I've always thought FORTH was the wave of the future.
regards,
	David
