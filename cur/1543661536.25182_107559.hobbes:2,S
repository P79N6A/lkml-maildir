I suggest you read clause 3b again:
   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object
   code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do
   one of the following:
     * b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third
       party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution,
       a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed
       under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
       interchange; or,
If you don't distribute a binary to someone, then you are under no
obligation to distribute source to them.  The GPL's always worked that
way.  One can't restrict what one's customers do with the source, but
that doesn't oblige one to give it away.

I'm told that the preview kits do include kernel source, although I
haven't checked for myself in a couple of months.
