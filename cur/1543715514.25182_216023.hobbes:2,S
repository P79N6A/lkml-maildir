Dmitry,
I'd like to add some arguments for includind a compatibility /dev/psaux
driver into production 2.6.x series.
- you argue that the driver is not ready for kernel because it doesn't
support all hardware. But it is typical - every driver may work only for
some defined subset of hardware availiable. There are many drivers in
linux kernel now, which are specific for some notebooks and/or controllers.
IBM ThinkPad is rather wide-spead notebooks, and IMHO only this reason is
sufficient argument not to reject suggested compatibility driver.
- it will be very inconvenient for _many_ users to modify this patch for
every new release of 2.6.x kernels. I'm not going into several discussions
concerning new input level approach. It is a good thing, and the development
of new approach will be continued, but why we have to reject optional
compatibility solution?
- if this driver will be included in mainstream, it will be additional
challenge for many people to extend its hardware compatibility.
Best wishes,
E.R.
