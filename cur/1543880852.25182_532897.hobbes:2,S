Hmm..., I'm thinking some codes in memory reclaim depend on
NR_FILE_MMAPED like follows
----snip----
if (zone_page_state(zone, NR_FILE_PAGES) -
                        zone_page_state(zone, NR_FILE_MAPPED) >
                        zone->min_unmapped_pages)
----snip----
Since we are enabling packet mmap feature, we should take its mapped
pages into count of NR_FILE_MAPPED.
