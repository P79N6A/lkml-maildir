Thanks.
AFAIK, there are essentially three "Centrino" chipsets
       Intel 855GM [1]
       Intel 855PM [2]
       Intel 855GME [3].
So 855PM based laptops seem to work, whereas 855GM based laptops
apparently don't. So it would be logical to assume it is the
difference between these two that causes the problems.
Unfortunately I'm not sure whether that brings us any further as it
seems that it is the integrated graphics stuff that makes the
difference -- or is there more?
Regards,
Georg
