When Ingo wrote something that went head-on with what Con wrote, it was his 
prerogative to do so.  There's no speaking here of rights to do or not to 
do since as matter of evidence, in the open source world, that which is 
superior (i.e. code, function, not person) has the right to exist and the 
inferior to die away.  Did Ingo have the obligation to improve Con's work? 
  Definitely not.  Did Con have a right to get Ingo's improvements or 
suggestions? Definitely not.  There are no such rights in this open source 
development framework (TM).
What Ingo did, I think, was what he wanted and he has the right to do that. 
       I believe that Ingo does not have an obligation to be responsible 
for what Con felt.  You feel what you feel because you choose to feel that 
way. Let us remember that "Happiness is a choice, not a state."
And let's just look at the attitudes on how both Ingo and Con reacted to 
the issues regarding their respective schedulers.  I won't list them here 
now since they're all there in the archives.
Since attitude also plays a big part in getting your code in mainline, I 
think we would know the reason why one got chosen for the other.
Thank you very much.
Best Regards,
Carlo
