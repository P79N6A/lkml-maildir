Greetings,
Is it possible to call kernel_thread at interrupt time?  I have a small
module that sets a kernel timer, and when the timer expires, the function
calls kernel_thread( threadfunc ).  threadfunc then does some
process-context things, like schedule().  The module compiles but I haven't
loaded it yet because I'm not physically on site to reboot it should there
be a problem... ;-)
The real piece I'm trying to solve is how to start a kernel thread and
change the name of it as shown in "ps".  The previous version of the module
just called kernel_thread from within init_module, but that produced a
thread named "insmod thread-module.o". ;)  I wrote over current->comm, and
/proc/pid/status shows the new name, but ps doesn't.  I looked through the
code for starting kpiod but I don't see what I'm missing.
thanks,
-bp
