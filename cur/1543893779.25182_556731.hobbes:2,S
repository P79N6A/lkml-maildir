Can we please stop this non-sense thread? Anyone designing the speaker 
circuit would certainly place a small capacitor in series with the 
speaker to kill the DC component of the signal.
Since the speaker itself wouldn't be able to play very low frequencies 
anyway, the capacitor wouldn't have to be that big.
So I'm pretty sure that on any half-way decent piece of hardware, you 
won't be able to kill the speaker with software...
