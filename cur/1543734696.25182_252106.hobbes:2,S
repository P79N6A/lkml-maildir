Insert card
	pc layer calls hotplug
	hotplug loads vga driver
	pci layer calls vga driver
	vga driver generates hotplug event
	hotplug loads stuff (user policy)
	vga driver calls hotplugged drivers

Thats what it does. The vga_device_register functions take a vga_driver
object which is a PCI driver lookalike with an extra field of "type" so
you can load DRM's, FB's etc

Possibly, thats for hotplug user space policy.
