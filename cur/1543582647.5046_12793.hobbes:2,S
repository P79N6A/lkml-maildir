I mentioned this earlier but it's worth repeating: the desire to use a
small block size is purely an artifact of the fact that ext2 has no
handling for tail block fragmentation.  That's a temporary situation -
once we've dealt with it your 2,000,000 file directory will be happier
with 4K filesystem blocks.  There will be a lot fewer metadata index
blocks in your directory file, for one thing.  Another practical matter
is that 4K filesystem blocks map directly to 4K PAGE_SIZE and are as a
result friendlier to the page cache and memory manager.
