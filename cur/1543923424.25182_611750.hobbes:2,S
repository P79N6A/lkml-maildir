Subject: [PATCH] raise tsc clocksource rating
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/29/429

From: Glauber de Oliveira Costa <glauber@t60.localdomain>
tsc is very good time source (when it does not have drifts, does not
change it's frequency, i.e. when it works), so it should have its rating
raised to a value greater than, or equal 400.
Since it's being a tendency among paravirt clocksources to use values
around 400, we should declare tsc as even better: So we use 500.
This patch also touches the comments on clocksource.h, which suggests
that 499 would be a limit on the rating values.
