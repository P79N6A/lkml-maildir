Ugh let's stop this thread now.  Two points:
	(a) imo, the kernel should support out-of-the-box the maximum
	    number of CPUs it can handle.  Be lucky we now have a
	    configure option to change that.  But that does not matter..
	(b) Right now it is 32.  Now you can change it... if you want
	    to change the current behavior by _default_ why don't we
	    suggest that _after_ this is accepted into 2.5?  I.e., one
	    battle at a time.
Thanks,
