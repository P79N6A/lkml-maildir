Hm, seems we missed another of those device attributes exhibiting
suicidal tendencies...
Tejun has a patchset allowing device attributes to commit suicide (see
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119027371416452&w=2
), although I'm
not sure what its current status is. Until then, you would need to use
device_schedule_callback() to commit suicide.
This all of course only applies if killing the segment is better than
leaving it in its current state, but others can make a better judgement
on that :)
