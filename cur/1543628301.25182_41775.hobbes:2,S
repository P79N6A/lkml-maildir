In fact, the basic premise is that people mail to the patchbot, not the
maintainer.  The patchbot knows who the maintainer is and forwards the patch
to the maintainer, using the maintainer's format of choice, or as now
proposed, just drops it into the BK repository and forwards a notification,
both to the maintainer and the linux-patches list.
