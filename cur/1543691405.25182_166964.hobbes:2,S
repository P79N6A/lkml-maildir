Define "correctly". Hint: it's user-dependent.

Not a bug.

Still not a bug. oldconfig stopped and asked you what to do,
you checked the help text and chose Y.
Option authors tend to want people to enable them (enable this
cool feature!) but in real life, most are Ok to disable.
If oldconfig were to choose Y for new options, then _that_
would be a bug.
