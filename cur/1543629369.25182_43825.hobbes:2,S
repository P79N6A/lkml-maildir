I have a Linux-based router and it can handle about as much as a cisco
7206vxr with GE interfaces. I think both of them reaches the bandwidth
limit of the PCI bus. The PC can be much better with 64bit/66MHz PCI
buses or you can even buy motherboards with 100 or 133MHz PCI-X slots. I
guess those can drive 3 or 4 GE interfaces at gigabit speed.
You need a cisco when you care about interface density, you have
interfaces you can't buy for a PC or you need to route protocols other
than IP or proprietary to cisco.
