Great! I'm glad to hear that it works also elsewhere that on my test
computers.

Probably yes.

It doesn't override it, that'd require patching the generic code so that
it doesn't return '33' in the default case.

It doesn't propagate, it's local to the via driver. Anyway, I've checked
the sources and the only driver that actually checks the system bus
speed other than my VIA and AMD drivers is the QD6580 VL-BUS IDE driver ...
All others assume 33 MHz PCI. Which in my opinion is a bug. Andre thinks
it's correct.

Unfortunately the PCI speed measuring code needs help from the chipset
itself, so it isn't possible to implement in generic code. Maybe a
callback could be added to the chipset-specific drivers, though ...
I do have some plans with ide-pci.c, so ...
