If reliability is your goal, testing at plug time is necessary but not 
sufficient. It avoids kernel failures caused by trying to use devices 
which are disfunctional (the kernel is far better at non-functional than 
broken). And some of the better drivers are far more robust at init time 
than in normal operation, not a bad thing at all. The init code can 
function as POST if it's written to do so.
Testing is a part of the reliability chain, as you note it isn't a 
substitute for all the other parts.
