Hi all,
My linux kernel did'nt detect my L2 cache on any of my two cpu ( this is an smp box ) here is the /proc/cpuinfo:
Therse processor are perfect Steping match SL3FJ( therse old katmai processor have 512k l2 cache ).
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 6
model           : 7
model name      : Pentium III (Katmai)
stepping        : 3
cpu MHz         : 549.070
cache size      : 32 KB
[...]
processor       : 1
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 6
model           : 7
model name      : Pentium III (Katmai)
stepping        : 3
cpu MHz         : 549.070
cache size      : 32 KB
And I get nothing in my dmesg about l2 cache ( 'dmesg | grep L2' give nothing )
I'm on an plain vanilla kernel ( 2.4.18 taken at kernel.org ) with xfs-1.1 patch.
At boot my bios say that my L2 of my two cpu are ok.
my dmesg will be online at 
http://paxl.no-ip.org/~paxl/dmesg.txt
 if somone mind.
Another fuzzy thing .. compiling my kernel normaly ( -j 1 ) take 30min and when I make it with -j 2/8/16 it take 25min, I think this is due to my L2 cache problem but that not normal, if somone have an idea.. I should be realy interested.
Another little detail that could help you, my mother board is an AMI MegaRUM II(that a dual p2/p3 mobo).
I hope somone will have an solution.
Thank you for your time
Xavier LaRue
