For what the code is trying to accomplish, the code is correct.
I agree the above change is also correct... probably the author wanted
to reduce the size of the -huge- data table where PCI_ALI15X3 symbol is
used.

When we have "modprobe piix4_ide" loading the IDE subsystem, you are
correct.
IDE is currently driven by an inward->outward setup of module
initialization, which is fundamentally the opposite of what we want,
which is chipset_drvr -> core initialization.
