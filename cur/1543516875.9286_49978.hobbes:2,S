 : I'm looking for a way to "shadow" an existing filesystem. Basically, so
 : that any request to /newfs/<dirs>/<file> would be redirected to
 : /var/newfs/<dirs>/<file>. This would be handled completely in the
 : kernel. I figure that I can use the same inode numbers in the shadow
 : filesystem as in the actual FS, and just redirect reads and
 : writes. However, lookup is giving me problems (since it just says "find
 : directory n in inode i"). Is there an easy way to lookup a prefixed path
 : in another filesystem?
looks like medusa (
http://medusa.fornax.sk
) could do it... 
though probably this different from what you wanted
