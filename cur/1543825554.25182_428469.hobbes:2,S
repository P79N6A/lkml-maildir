Hi,
I am looking at NFS implementation included in kernel 2.6.16. In
nfs/inode.c, function nfs_delete_inode() called nfs_wb_all() after
truncate_inode_pages(). However, truncate_inode_pages is supposed to
flush out pages, why do we still need nfs_wb_all()? Moreover, after
this nfs_wb_all,  function nfs_delete_inode() immediately calls
clear_inode(), which will call nfs_wb_all() again.
This looks redundant to me. Any explaination on this?
Thanks,
Xin
