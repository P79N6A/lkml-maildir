As just pointed out to me the minute I did a substitution I went wrong:
A branch factor of 128 leads to 
1 + (7 + 7 + 6)*128 words = 2561 words per file, which is somewhat
more severe. =(
More corrections are welcome.

This doesn't quite hold up after the the correction above. 4K open
files ends up having 10.5K words or 40MB of overhead.
