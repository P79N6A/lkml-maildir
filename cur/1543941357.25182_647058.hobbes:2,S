Hi!
I'm trying to get the 2.6.24 Linux kernel booting on my AmigaOne machine
(it's a desktop PowerPC G4 machine with 1.5GB RAM). I have written the
device tree and platform setup files for arch/powerpc, which seem to be
working so far.
Kernel version 2.6.24-rc2 was booting fine with my patches until the
kernel executes the INIT command. But kernel release v2.6.24 dies early
during the boot process (even before the radeonfb driver initializes and
outputs kernel messages). Bisecting revealed that this commit causes my
machine to fail booting:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=44048d700bcbfaf4bcca6e2e0a73d89d01ec0878
(Revert "Bias the placement of kernel pages at lower PFNs")
The machine boots fine, if I revert the patch. But I wonder what side
effects this patch may have? Can somebody shed some light on this?
Thanks!
regards,
Gerhard
