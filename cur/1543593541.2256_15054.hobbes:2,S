One question here which has been bugging me all through this thread, is
there any hardware that actually measures to that precision and accuracy ??
certanally 0.1K intervals, but 0.01 ?, and at 0.001K intervals ? is this
going ott ? and what use would people have with measureing system temp to
0.01K precision ? --i would assume that the accuracy of the temp sensors is
less than that...
well, there are my two cents ...

Farenhait is irritating, yes, and the brits that suggested it are becoming a
dying bread, although still large in number, things more so use Celsius
nowerdays.
btw, the kelvin scale is a centigrade scale, like wise, so is the celsius
scale ...
Thanks,,
