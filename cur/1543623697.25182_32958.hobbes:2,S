Hmmm, you have better man pages than me.  I don't have an madvise man page
on either of my boxes (RH 6.2 and 7.2 :-)
From that description, you're right.  The code is very clear on what happens,
as is the comment above sys_madvise:
 *  MADV_DONTNEED - the application is finished with the given range,
 *		so the kernel can free resources associated with it.

Yeah, that's a decent idea.  If you were going to make it fancier, you could
cover the case that the UML's clean pages are all busy but it has lots of
old dirty pages lying around.  But then you'd need some way for the host to
tell the UML that I/O would be a really bad idea and it should just dump
clean pages.
