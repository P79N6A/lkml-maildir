Well, as a license is in escence a promise not to sue you for using my
property as long as you comply with certain conditions, it will then be up
to the licensors. If Linus is OK with distributing just tar.bz2's, its OK
for the kernel. Also, RMS specifically said using bk doesn't make the
repository source in the GPL sense (this is presumably the intention the
FSF will put forward, and which most other GPL-licensing parties will
agree).
IANAL (and happy for it ;-)
