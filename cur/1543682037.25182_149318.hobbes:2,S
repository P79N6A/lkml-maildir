Actually, the macro to do this is already there.  Is there a real 
reason not to use it.  The using code sure looks cleaner with it.

I would love to get to the instruction via normal C.

The mpy_l_X_l_ll() is there because it is so easy to get it wrong.  It 
is standard C (well gcc) but if you don't get the casting just right 
it will throw away the high bits.

Is there any need to change any thing at all?  Or maybe a comment 
somewhere on what direction we would like things to go.
When I look at the div code on the risc machines I begin to really 
understand why gcc avoids the div instruction so actively.  (It 
optimizes away almost all divides by constants.)
