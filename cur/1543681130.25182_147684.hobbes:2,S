Hi,
for your own safety writing is disabled in the OLD ntfs driver.  I
guarantee you that if you bypass this and enable write support, your
entire partition will be destroyed or damaged.  I strongly suggest you do
NOT enable write support!
If you don't care and just want to try anyway you need to mount readonly
 AND then you need to remount rw again.  This will enable writing:
mount -o ro ...
mount -o remount,rw ...
But really do NOT do this!  It WILL eat your data, especially if you
change the directory structure as you seem to want to do.
If you want to modify existing files without changes in file size then
download the new ntfs driver (2.1.4a) patch from
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/downloads.html
 and use this.  It ONLY allows
modifying of existing files without changes in file size but at least it
allows it SAFELY.
Best regards,
	Anton
