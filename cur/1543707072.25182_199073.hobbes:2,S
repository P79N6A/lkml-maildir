The way to handle that is to aim to never _ever_ decode utf-8 unless you 
really have to. Always leave the string in utf-8 "raw bytestring" mode as 
long as possible, and convert to charater sets only when actually 
printing.
If you do that, then at worst you'll show the user a strange name (extra
points for marking it as being errenous), but everything still works. You
can still lookup/delete/whatever the file (internally the program still
works on the raw byte sequence and isn't confused). Basically accept the
fact that UTF-8 strings can contain "garbage", and don't try to fix it up.
And no, I'm not claiming that it's wonderfully clean and that we should
all love it. But it's _practical_, and the ugliness is certainly a lot
less than in the alternatives.
And it largely works today.
