Meelis,
Solving the first problem will probably take time, as we'll need
to dive into the error recovery paths of ide-scsi and the SCSI
subsystem.
Regarding the second problem, please test the attached patch. ide-scsi
maintains two "SCSI-6" to "SCSI-10" on/off command translation states:
1.	Translation for access through /dev/sg -- off by default.
2.	Translation for the high level SCSI code -- on by default.
ide-scsi is using:
	if (MAJOR(cmd->request.rq_dev) == SCSI_GENERIC_MAJOR)   
		return test_bit(IDESCSI_SG_TRANSFORM, &scsi->transform);
to test if a SCSI command originated in /dev/sg. sg.c is setting
	SCpnt->request.rq_dev = devt = inode->i_rdev;
after calling scsi_allocate_device() (so that we'll identify such
a command as originating from the sg driver). What I suspect is
happening, though, is that after you use cdrecord, the same SCSI
command structures are being recycled for use by the SCSI cdrom
driver, and that when the MODE_SENSE_6 command is issued, the rq_dev
field will still contain the rq_dev from the old structure, and
ide-scsi will therefore not enable the command translation to
MODE_SENSE_10. Ejecting the cdrom might work around the problem,
as it might result in another command structure allocated for the
MODE_SENSE command, which doesn't contain the sg signature in rq_dev.
The following patch will default rq_dev to 0 when allocating a
new command structure. This can potentially create a side effect,
though, and we'll perhaps have to run on all the places which
allocate a command structure with a NULL parameter to reqp, and
update the rq_dev field to reflect the driver in which the request
originated.
Even if the patch won't work, try to change should_transform()
in drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c to unconditionally return 1 on your
system, so that we'll at least establish that a missing command
translation is really the cause of the second problem.
