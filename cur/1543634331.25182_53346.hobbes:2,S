Lots of bits got thrown out this time, as Christoph Hellwig went through
the patch and picked up on quite a few obviously wrong bits. In addition,
this patch introduces the mad axemen, who come to carve up all that is
monolithic. Patrick's MTRR split-up has been around for a while, and could
use a bit more testing before it goes to Linus. The AGPGART changes I did
this afternoon, and haven't seen much testing at all yet.
Finally, another round of compile fixes and the likes from Linux Kernel.
As usual,..
Patch against 2.5.23 vanilla is available from:
