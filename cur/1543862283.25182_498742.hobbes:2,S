One thing that I've been using, and seems to work well, is a customized
version of the readahead program several distros use during boot up.
Mine starts off doing:
mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE);
...yadda, yadda...
and for each file listed:
...open, stat stuff...
       if( NULL == mmap(
                NULL, stat_buf.st_size, 
                PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED|MAP_LOCKED|MAP_POPULATE,
                fd, 0)
        ) {
                fprintf(stderr, "'%s' ", file);
                perror("mmap");
        }
...more stuff...
and then ends with:
pause();
and it sits there forever.
As far as I can tell, this makes the program and library code stay in
RAM.  At least, after a drop_caches nautilus doesn't load 12 MB off
disk, it just starts.  It has to be reloaded after software updates and
after prelinking.  I find the 250 MB used to be worthwhile, even if its
kinda Windowsey.
Something like that could keep your system responsive no matter what the
disk cache is doing otherwise.
