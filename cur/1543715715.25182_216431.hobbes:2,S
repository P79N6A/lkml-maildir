That seems an odd error code to change it to, since its not
related to the device running out of free space right?  Maybe
use -E2BIG instead?
XFS has a similar check (different limit as you know), so is
also affected by this; could you update XFS at the same time
with whatever value gets chosen, if its not EINVAL?  Or just
let me know what gets chosen & I'll fix it up later.
thanks.
