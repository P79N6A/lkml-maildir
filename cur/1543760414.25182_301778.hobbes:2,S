I've got another one of these cards and it does not display these
issues. That box is running 2.6.9-ac10 whilst mine is running 2.6.11-ac2
though and the HD is a western digital whilst my HDs are a Seagate and an
IBM. I can't really test on that box (but I can give out any 'doesn't
require me to poke it hard' info) as it's in production but my g/w is
fine for testing stuff.
Should I be worried about the BUG bit on the hda and hdc lines as above?

Cool. BTW I set multisec manually and flipped unmaskirq on and did a
copy of 37GB of data from hdc to hda. The promise card used to fail
abysmally at this task (either with both drives on the one card or (and
this was worse) one drive per card). This fills me with more joy then I
can say. I've been wanting to make this box my mail server for yonks and
now it looks like I'll be able to. Thanks! :)
