I think we would be wise to use something other than loops_per_jiffy.
Depending upon the loop calibration method used by a particular
architecture it can me one of many different things.
Some platforms don't even make use of it and thus leave it at it's
default value of "1<<12", so using it as a heuristic here is arbitrary
at best.
