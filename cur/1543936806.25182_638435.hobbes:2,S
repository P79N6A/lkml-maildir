I'm ok w/taking the arch/powerpc bits, but I"m a bit concerned about  
the driver itself.  I'm wondering if we need a TDM framework in the  
kernel.
I guess if Poonam could possibly describe how this driver is actually  
used that would be helpful.  I see we have 8315 with a discrete TDM  
block and I'm guessing 82xx/85xx based CPM parts of some form of TDM  
as well.
