I think a better solution to this case would be to ensure the
readahead window is always min(size of read, some large number);
The size of the read is basically a free and accurate "hint" to
the minimum size of the required readahead.
Either that or do a simple "preread" while you're still in the
read request window, and run readahead when that completes.
