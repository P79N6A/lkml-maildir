Hi,
Can we also please reconcile the CRASH_DUMP Kconfig help text?
I.e., it says
  The crash dump kernel must be compiled
  to a memory address not used by the main kernel or BIOS using
  PHYSICAL_START.
but this ignores the use of RELOCATABLE, right?

Update help text for CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP.
Fix typos in CONFIG_RELOCATABLE.
Use tab + 2 spaces for indentation on all lines.
