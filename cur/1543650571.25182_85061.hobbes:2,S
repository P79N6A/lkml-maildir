   Yes, but I think
     - integrate our code to your tree
   then
     - reimplement (re-design)
   is better way to go forward.
   
Absolutely not, we do not put improperly architected code into the
tree first then clean it up later.
Especially because this source address selection code interferes with
many IPSEC issues.  Source address selection belongs at routing
tables, and there is no arguing about this.  If you put it somewhere
else it gets in the way and causes many problems.
Please implement source address selection properly, then resubmit.
Thank you.
   
   I need to check the result of current code and 
   to look at diff by byte-to-byte before preparing
   patches for current tree.
   
Ok.
