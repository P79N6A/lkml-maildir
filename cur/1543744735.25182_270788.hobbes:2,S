Hmm. Apparently drivers/ide/ppc/pmac.c wasn't among those fixed up:
	drivers/ide/ppc/pmac.c: In function `pmac_ide_macio_suspend':
	drivers/ide/ppc/pmac.c:1363: error: structure has no member named `power_state'
	drivers/ide/ppc/pmac.c:1366: error: structure has no member named `power_state'
	...
Is it always valid to just replace
	dev->dev.power_state
with
	dev->dev.power.power_state
or is there anything subtler going on?
