Hello,
I had downloaded the tar.gz of glibc;
I
I am interested in the learning the network layer and
implementation of  the socket API in glibc
(calls like socket,bind,gethostbyname,etc.).
I saw in the inet subdirectory on glibc that it seems that  these calls
are eventually result in calls to methods in nss subdirectory.
But I am not sure.
Am I right in my assumption?
or where I can find the implementation of methods like bind(), connect(), 
socket(), etc.
regards
sting
