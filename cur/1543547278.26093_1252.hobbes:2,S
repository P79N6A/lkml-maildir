Good that _somebody_ actually looked at the code. I'll make some more
modifications to handle blocked signals correctly (ie handling the case
where the signal is blocked in all threads and then unblocked in one of
them _after_ it was delivered), but I've been disappointed by how much hot
air there's been on the list, and how little comments on how the actual
code works.
Thanks, Uli/.

We already do this. This is exactly what CLONE_SIGHAND does.
Having looked at the problem some more, it appears to never really make
sense to have CLONE_THREAD and CLONE_SIGHAND be separate. Basically,
either you share signals or you don't. Pthreads shares them. I'll make it
a single flag, and we'll have CLONE_SIGNAL (same as old CLONE_SIGHAND),
and that will be a "signal group" aka "thread group".

Fair enough.

No, it would be another "clone" option. 
But I don't think this is performance-critical, and I don't think it is
something people really care about. So I'd be unlikely to handle this for
2.4.x.

This is why you should have the "n+1" approach. The "+1" thing is the one
that sees the "n" threads die. The parent of the threaded process is the
one that sees the "+1" die.

Yes, as far as I can tell. I still don't think you should do it directly
like this.

You can actually do this with CLONE_PTRACE right now.
