Hi,
Claas asked for the NX flag for the Via C3 (?) processors
in another thread.
I do not know another synonym for this?

The via C3 documentation is at:
http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/processors/c3/
I have seen in c3_ebga.zip that the processor might support
3DNow. But you have to check the registers about this.
Inside linux-2.6.22-rc1/arch/i386/kernel/cpu/centaur.c I just
see a "fixed type" detection.
Does anybody have more information on this ?
Otherwise I would play around a little with my C3 Nehemiah
and try to change the detection according the Via documentation.
Best regards,
Christian
