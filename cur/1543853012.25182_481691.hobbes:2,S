lets try my patch in -mm for a while.
Had i ever noticed this hack in the first place i would have NAK-ed it. 
There is a fundamental design friction of a high-level feature like 
HOTPLUG_CPU /requiring/ a fundamental change to the lowlevel IRQ 
delivery mode! Such a requirement is broken and just serves to hide a 
flaw in the hotplug design - which flaw would trigger on i386 /anyway/, 
because i386 still uses logical delivery mode for APIC IPIs. Also, i'd 
like to have a description of how to reproduce those CPU hotplug 
problems, so that i can try to fix it.
