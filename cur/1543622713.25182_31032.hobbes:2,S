Do you want a dump of the vpd_data it receives?  Here's the dmesg line after
the driver is loaded:
tg3.c:v0.90 (Feb 25, 2002)
eth1: Tigon3 [partno() rev 7102 PHY(5401)] (PCI:66MHz:64-bit) 10/100/1000BaseT Ethernet 00:06:5b:05:f9:8e
The machine is a Dell PowerEdge 2550 machine, running RedHat Linux 7.2 (with
2.4.18 kernel).  Let me know if you want me to run any specific tests, it's
connected to a Cisco switch with gigabit-ports (so I can actually test
things like jumboframes if needed).
