I just noticed that my multiple probes support patch, that just got into
mainline, does not include the fixes I did you asked for (which includes
protecting with rcu_read_lock). I guess Andrew did not notice the patch.
Therefore, I think we'll need to address this pretty soon to make the
markers play nicely with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU.
