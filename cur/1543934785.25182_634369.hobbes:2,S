Unfortunately there are certainly some that don't make many options
for configuration and also use a vast amount; my Toshiba A100-306
uses an entire 1GB for the PCI space and has very little in the
way of configuration.

Note that some system and memory vendors have incorrect statements
stating that the 3.xGB limit is a 32bit OS issue on these machines
and it'll all just work fine on 64bit OSs.
