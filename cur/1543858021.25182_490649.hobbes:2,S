I think one possible target would be struct timer, at least
in theory.
There is also a line of reasoning that says that on 64-bit
platforms we have some flexibility to set HZ very large, if
we wanted to at some point, and going to 32-bit jiffies
storage for some things may eliminate that kind of flexibility.
Just some food for thought...
