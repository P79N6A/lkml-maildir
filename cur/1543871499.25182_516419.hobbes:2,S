ACPI AML is turing-complete -- that means it is as powerful any
programming language. It can do arbitrary computation. That means it
is theoretically impossible to analyze its accesses using any program.
Now... may be possible to introduce _some_ ACPI BIOSes, but doing it
would certainly be very complex -- we are talking "put gcc into
kernel" here.
So no, it is not possible to preallocate the ranges.
