It is a special case because we typically use other time sources. The 
limitations of cycle counters in SMP environments are well known and most 
hardware manufacturers have dealt with this issue by using another clock 
source.

If it is really synchronized then you can run with "nojitter" without any 
issue. Then you wont have to deal with the cmpxchg and everything is fine. 
But I suspect that the ITC are NOT truly synchronized (it has an 
"offset" that may be nonzero right?) otherwise you would have used nojitter.

Extra timer hardware is necessary to fix the ITC deficiency. You are at 
the source of the problem. Fix the damn hardware to provide a standardized 
synchronized clock or provide a truly synchronized ITC.
