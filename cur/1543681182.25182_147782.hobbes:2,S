atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0xb8, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.
atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0x9d, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.
When I press certain key combinations I get this logged.
Also if I hold down a key sometimes it gets 'stuck' and repeats forever
until I break the repeat.
Why is this happening in 2.5?
Is it due to my KVM or something else?
Thanks,
Shawn S.
