Okay. Sounds good. The last time I had '/' full, I really cleaned it.
I wondered why it had filled up. I checked /var/log /var/adm, etc.
I couldn't find what had filled it up. Then I thought that one of
my backups may have put a 'tar' file in /dev because of some mispelled
device-name. There I found '/dev/root'. After recursively deleting
this I had lots of space, ...err, buf `df` didn't work anymore ;^)
I never did find out what had filled it up but it sure was empty after
that....
Cheers,
