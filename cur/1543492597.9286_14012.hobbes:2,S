   A friend told me "window scaling" would help a lot, but as far as
   I can see, it is already turned on,
It is ok by default, but the default send/recv buffer max/default
settings prevent it from being utilized since the limits are within
what non-window scaling allows.
   A possible cause is that the network DOES deliver lots of packets
   out-of-order, but in reality no packets are really lost.
Try turning off TCP timestamps, see if that helps.
