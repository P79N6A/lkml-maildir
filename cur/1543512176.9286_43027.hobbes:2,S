I've noticed some posts in the last few days that relate to the the disk
subsystem trying to access blocks beyond the limits of the device.
I've seen the same problem on one of the machines I administrate.  In my
situation, syslogd logged the messages until the machine ground to a halt.
The machine would respond to console changes but when a login was attempted,
login name name and password could be entered but an endless hang followed
due to load/inactivity of disk subsystem?  So, the kernel didn't panic;
processes were still running.  The machine has a DPT SmartRAID V adapter
in it; it had no audible alarm which leads me to believe there was no
hardware problem with the disk array.  The machine was than chunked.
Unfortunately the person that chunked the  machine didn't know 'magic sysrq
keys' was built in.  So no sync/mount-ro was attempted before the reboot.
When the machine booted, the kernel panicked because of massive filesystem
corruption on the root partition.  When the fs was finally fixed via
e2fsck, the lost+found dir had numerous unreferenced inode entries.
That didn't concern me too much until I examined them; all of which
are special char/block files that can't be unlinked!? 'unlink: Operation
not permitted'  My question is whether this is a 2.2.12 or driver issue
that causes the 'attempt to access beyond end of device' kernel messages?
The machine has the following hardware:
Intel SC450NX MP server/mainboard
4 Intel 500MHz/512KB PIII Xeon CPUs
1GB memory
1 SmartRAID V PM3754U2 with 3 channels and 128MB ecc memory
RAID-5 array composed from 6 IBM DNES-309170 9GB/10K disks aprox: 43GB
array is split into 4 partitions (from fdisk):
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/sda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 5575 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes

   /dev/sda1   *         1         2     16033+  83  Linux
   /dev/sda2             3        19    136552+  82  Linux swap
   /dev/sda3            20       150   1052257+  83  Linux
   /dev/sda4           151      5575  43576312+  83  Linux
The kernel is the stock 2.2.12 kernel tree with driver patch from DPT.
The kernel was built with RedHat 6.0 gcc:
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
Driver info:
#cat /proc/scsi/dpt/3 
Vendor: DPT Model: PM3754U2         Rev: 204C, scsi 3:
DPT I2O Driver Version: 1.05/1.1:
        cmd_per_lun = 210, max_id = 15, max_lun = 7, max_channel = 2
        sg_tablesize = 39, irq = 19, OutstandingMsgs = 1
        maxfromiopmsgs = 16, maxtoiopmsgs = 210
    Devices:
        Channel = 0, Target = 0, Lun = 0
        Channel = 0, Target = 6, Lun = 0
It comes to my attention that this driver is a revision behind from a prior
post.  However, the newer driver possibly still has problems according to
another post?
I've contacted DPT and inquired if they had heard any problems with their
kernel patch with the stock 2.2.12 kernel.  No was the answer I got.
If this is not a 2.2.12 issue, then is there anyone else out there that
has had similar problems with their DPT SRV RAID arrays?
