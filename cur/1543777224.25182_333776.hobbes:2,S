There's a lot of code like this in there .. I've seen some that down()
in process contex, and up() in interrupt contex which is weird .. But
those aren't major features, just little drivers. XFS is pretty major
feature.
Nathan, does XFS need this property or could we convert it to
synchronize the locking (with ease?)?
