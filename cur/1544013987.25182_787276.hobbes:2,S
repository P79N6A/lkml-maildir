Just for the record:  my feeling is that since no such
drivers currently use the regulator framework, it's wrong
to design-in breakage to support them.
When someone writes a cpufreq driver that uses the
regulator framework, they can arrange to provide the
relevant "struct device *" to make that work neatly.
Meanwhile, I still think the regulator framework should
be using driver model messages.  Since the only reason
not to use them is to support those non-existent drivers.

p.s. Glad to see at least part of this patch get merged,
   even if related diagnostics are lacking.
