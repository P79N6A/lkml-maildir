Although you can argue that anyone coding here should be a guru, in 
practice things this subtle really would be helped by a comment in the 
initial code. I don't agree that "if it was hard to write it should be 
hard to understand." Clearly several competent people missed this 
dependency, or the patch would not have gone in.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
