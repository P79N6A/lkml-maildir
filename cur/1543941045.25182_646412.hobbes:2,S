In ext2 (and most other block filesystems) all files are sparse files. 
If you write to an address in the file for which no block is allocated, 
the filesystem allocates a block and writes the contents to disk, 
regardless of whether that block is at the end of the file (the usual 
case of lengthening a non-sparse file), in the middle of the file 
(filling in holes in a sparse file), or past the the end of the file 
(making a file sparse).
