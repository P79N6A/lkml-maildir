My netdevice probes for it's interrups on its own and does so
successfully.
When I have not loaded modules for the ide-devices (int 14 only since I
use only ide0) my netdevice finds int 15 free and configures itself
accordingly.
But when I bring up my card with 
ifconfig eth1 up
and I activated debugging, my debug outputs to syslogd report, that the
device statistics are fetched quite often, about 600 times a second.
This does not happen when I load my ide-modules and my card finds some
other interrupt. 
Now I guess that the network stack must decide that it needs the
device-statistics on a very regular bases :-)
My device does not get any interrupts, though. in /proc/interrupts
only 1 irq is reported (the one from the irq-probing).
What happens here? 
kernel 2.2.13, debian potato
