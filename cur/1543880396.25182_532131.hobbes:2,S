"Fairness between users" was implemented long time ago by rik van riel
(
http://surriel.com/patches/2.4/2.4.19-fairsched
). Some people has been
asking for a functionality like that for a long time, ie: universities that want
to avoid gcc processes from one student that is trying to learn how fork()
works from starving the processes of rest of the students.
But not only they want "fairness between users", they also want "priorities
between users and/or groups of users", ie: "the 'students' group shouldn't
starve the 'admins' group".
