No, it hasn't --- at least not unless there has been a seekdir in
between.  If the client has already been told that we're at EOF, then
it's wrong to go back to the server again for more data. 
Having said that, the server is clearly in error in sending a
duplicate cookie in the first place, and if it did so we'd never get
into such a state.

Well, glibc will *always* issue another readdir, because the only way
we can ever tell glibc that we're at EOF on the directory is when we
eventually return 0 from getdents.  The question about client
behaviour is, if we've already been told that the stream is at EOF,
should the client simply discard that info and keep reading
regardless, or should it cache the EOF status?

Agreed.
