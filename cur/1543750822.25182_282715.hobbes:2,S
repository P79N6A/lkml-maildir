Please don't do it like this - you made the patch now depend on the 
ugliest code in the universe, namely that horribly crappy kgdb-ga sh*t 
("Don't hold back, Linus, tell us how you really feel").
The 16-bit stack code may not be the prettiest either, but it doesn't hold 
a candle to the asm-crap that is entry.S after kgdb-ga.
"resume_kernelX"? What crud.
