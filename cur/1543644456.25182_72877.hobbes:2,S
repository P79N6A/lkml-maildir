Ahh, I never thought of using the program name for a directory.  That
would be nice as only those programs you pre-made a directory for would
dump (as the code does not create directories).  Using the UID for a
directory name works out to separate the dumps of different users.
(And works really well too - albeit on a non-Linux platform that happens
to have a simular feature.)

I would be willing to do the work to make it configurable but when I
look at the size of the code, it really is not that large.  I tried
to keep it simple (KISS is always good).  I still need to write up the
documentation side of this into the patch too.  (I keep forgetting
to do that :-()
