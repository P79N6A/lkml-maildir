Similar weirdness here on rc6-mm2 and rc6-rt*:
resume from disk waits unduly long.
I played with bios clock setting after I wondered why susp/res
 wouldn't work overnight:
the longer the (faked/real) suspend to disk time,
the longer the (not seen on 2.6.18-rt) waiting past the incrementing
% display, before things are running again.
After turning time backwards in bios, console mouse handler gpm experiences
"interrupted system call". 
Some waiting times from rc6-rt6 from memory:
Config			| HZ			| NO_HZ + HRESTIMERS
cmos clock unchanged	| 2s			| 6s
cmos clock += 10min	| 			| 2 minutes
cmos clock += 2 month	| 20s			| > 4minutes, test interrupted
