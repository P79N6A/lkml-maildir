Yes, you're right. I didn't read the original statement very closely.
Processes that are running in the kernel only give up to other threads by
having 'if(need_reschedule) schedule()' or other similar coroutine calls. 
The statement seems to imply that this is a problem. It's not.  Interrupts
and bottom halves can preempt, which is what's important for tasks where
you care about such things, namely real-time.  Many of the people who care
about real-time will tell you that trying to muck with the kernel to do
things differently is not really a win. So no, it's not "beyond the
argument", as the implied "Linux is missing an important feature" of the
original statement is wrong.

Excuse me? When a process calls a system call, the process is running _in
the kernel_ (see below). Multiple processes can call the same system
calls. If the machine is SMP, two processes can call the same system call
simultaneously. What, pray tell, is your definition of reentrant?

The kernel is more like a library than a process. Calling the kernel is
not a task switch - it's just a fancy function call (a software interrupt
that does a ring 0 transition). Task switches happen when schedule() 
decides to call switchto(). When a process makes a system call, the system
call is still in the process context, so it makes sense to say 'a process
is in the kernel'. And this isn't just semantics - the stack the kernel
uses is allocated per-process so the kernel's execution state is tied to
the process.
In the same way that multiple processes can call the same function in the
C library simultaneously, multiple processes can call the same syscalls.
By having the kernel use stacks attached to the process, the simpler parts
of reentrancy are not a problem, in the same way the shared image of libc
doesn't have a problem with multiple processes executing its code. When
running on SMP, the exact same holds true, except now code execution is
truly concurrent. So the kernel runs on all processors. Various spinlocks
provide resource protection and mutual exclusion where needed, which means
sometimes one processor will have to spin its wheels waiting to access
something, but this is no different from NT. 
But don't take my word for it, look at the source.
