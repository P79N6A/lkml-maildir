Yes. We originally had an implementation that would use the existing
per-zone LRU, but the reclamation path was O(n), where n is the number
of classes. So, we moved towards a O(1) algorithm.

Understood, will work and come up with an acceptable memory controller.

Yes, indeed :). As I told earlier this patch is not ready for lkml or -
mm yet.

Yes, it is effective, and the reclamation is O(1) too. It has couple of
problems by design, (1) doesn't handle shared pages and (2) doesn't
provide support for both min_shares and max_shares.

Yes, that is the core object of ckrm, associate resources to a group of
tasks.

Yes, it would get more aggressively reclaimed. But, if you have the I/O
controller also configured appropriately only class A will be affected.

We could go with "Resource Group" as Matt suggested.
