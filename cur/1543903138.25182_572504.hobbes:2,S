Subject: [PATCH] Fix Lindent to not indent preprocessor comments so far
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/20/270

I recently ran Lindent over the AdvanSys driver and it moved the
comments on #else and #endif lines way over to the right:
#else                          /* ADVANSYS_DEBUG */
This doesn't match what I expect from kernel style, but it is
documented.  We just need another flag to indent to make this look like:
#else /* ADVANSYS_DEBUG */

a retrograde step."
