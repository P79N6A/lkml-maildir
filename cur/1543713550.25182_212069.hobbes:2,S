hello,
I have written several times to kraxel at bytesex dot com but I got no 
reply.
I have data for a new bttv 878 based card that I think must be 
introduced in the cards database info in order to make it work.
Who is the maintainer of that driver right now?
Thanks a lot!
P.S.: CC me if you can... I'm not subscribed.
