Well, this is completely questionable. Even if SKAS3 will never be merged in 
mainline on the host side, the SKAS3 support in UML has already been merged. 
And I think SYSEMU will be much more welcome than those patches (in fact, 
it's completely independent from the SKAS patch).
For an earlier discussion, see:
http://www.kerneltraffic.org/kernel-traffic/kt20030106_199.html#4
And even if SKAS3 will not be merged, SKAS4 will, and the current UML SKAS 
code should need just a very few changes. While having the code in mainline 
is important to get it fixed with API changes.

This would be generally right, but for now, please hold on until next -rc.
Sorry for the problem and thanks for the help!
