Currently this is not enough information to have a clue as to what
is going wrong.  
Does reboot=hard (on the kernel command line) change the behaviour?
Does magic sysrq work after the system hangs?
Can you narrow it down to a -git snapshot where reboot breaks for
you?
The reboot path has been made much more consistent since 2.6.12 and
most of the bugs removed.  But it would not surprise me if some lurking bugs are now
triggering.
