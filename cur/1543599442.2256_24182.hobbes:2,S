Updated patches are at:
http://tech9.net/rml/linux/patch-rml-2.4.9-ac3-preempt-kernel-1
and,
http://tech9.net/rml/linux/patch-rml-2.4.10-pre2-preempt-kernel-1
for kernels 2.4.9-ac3 and 2.4.10-pre2.
These are updates of Nigel Gamble's kernel preemption patches for recent
kernels.  See 
http://kpreempt.sourceforge.net/.
  These patches create a
configure option to enable a preemptible kernel using SMP lock points.
A preemptible kernel will yield control of execution to higher priority
processes as needed.  Ie, the process timeslice now applies to kernel
space.
Changes since my previous patch:
* update for 2.4.9-ac3 and 2.4.10-pre2
* fix the compile bug (yay!) -- the linking dependency of dec_and_lock
requires CONFIG_HAVE_DEC_LOCK which SMP sets in recent kernels.  now
CONFIG_PREEMPT sets, too
So, yes, this should fix the kernel compile buggy.  At least it did for
me, after I was finally able to reproduce the problem.
Enjoy and please comment, test, and benchmark.
