One non-arch difference between rc3 and bk4 seems to involve IDE DMA.
When I ran briefly ran bk4 I got a few IDE DMA errors (ThinkPad A30,
TOSHIBA MK8025GAS).  Makes one wonder.  Thus:
Is the IDE patch in bk4 (that's missing from rc3) going to be in
2.6.3?  Does it only come into play with SCSI, as it seems to, or
does it affect a non-SCSI setup?
Here's the diff between bk4 and rc3:
