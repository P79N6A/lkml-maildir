No - don't have to.  Not if I don't mind giving fools that embed
newlines in paths second class service.
In my case, if I create a file named "foo\nbar", then backup and restore
it, I end up with a restored file named "foo%0Abar".  If I had backed up
another file named "foo%0Abar", and now restore it, it collides, and
last one to be restored wins.  If I really need the "foo\nbar" file back
as originally named, I will have to dig it out by hand.
I dare say that Linux kernel source does not require first class support
for newlines embedded in pathnames.

No - but it's damn convenient.  Alot of tools work on line-oriented
ASCII that don't work elsewhere.
I guess Perl-hackers won't care much, but those working with either
classic shell script tools or Python will find line formatted ASCII more
convenient.
