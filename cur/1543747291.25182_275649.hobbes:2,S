Looks that way ;-)

Right.

I can do it... each chapter is a separate file ;-)

Exactly what I'd do.

I happen to agree.

Right. And network connections, and pipes (connecting programs) are files
too.

You are right.
The next question is "Is the fragmentation required?", and then "How would
an OS without this fragmentation work?". Anwer to the first question is
"Not really, but...", answer to the second one is "It has been tried, got
nowhere" (The various IBM minicomputer OSes had no filesystem, just a
(relational) database for everything; didn't catch on. Multiple people have
worked on "persistent programming" (data floats around, programs munge it
and then go away), even APL and similar languages worked on that principle;
none did never get anywhere near "popular". There must be other examples
around).  You can't just go around pretending an element in an array is the
same as a device or a full database, recursively.  That way lies madness,
recursion _has_ to stop somewhere.

But the result _can't_ live inside the Unix worldview, it is quite at odds
with it on a fundamental level. I.e., build an environment that works that
way, don't go around trying to pretend things are what they aren't.
