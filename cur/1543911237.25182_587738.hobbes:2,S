Don't we need to synchronize the manipulation of the hotplugged CPU's
contribution and the manipulation of cpu_online_map?  Otherwise, if
stats are called for just before (or just after, depending on the
ordering of hotplug operations) the invocation will get the wrong
statistics.

There are some ways to decrease its utilization if it should become
a problem in any case.
