sorry I'm not a framebuffer expert, but it remains to be seens if the BIOS really
locks the IRQs that long, or the framebuffer code spends too much time in the
update routines without checking need_resched.
the easiest way is to use my latencytest on a kernel with the low-latency patch
applied.

 )
( test with an UP kernel, because SMP is not handled well on this kernel).
then run a test session while your box is in idle mode,
and later during heavy framebuffer updates.
If the latencies are high in the 2nd case, there is a problem in the frame buffer
code,
and/or BIOS routines.
Benno.
