I think this will already work as-is. All you should need to do is
register the multicast address in the DNS server.
Have you tried it? Some well-known multicast addresses (like NTP's) are
commonly registered with root servers already.
I haven't tried using "gethostbyame()" on a multicast address that is
registered, but I'm not aware of any checks on the class of the address
in any of the code.
