Daniel, if device process bio by itself, it has a limit and thus it will
wait in generic_make_request(), if it queues it to different device,
then the same logic applies there. If virutal device does not process
bio, its limit will always be recharged to underlying devices, and
overall limit is equal to number of physical device (or devices which do
process bio) multiplied by theirs limits. This does _work_ and I showed
example how limits are processed and who and where will sleep. This
solution is not narrow fix, please check my examples I showed before.
