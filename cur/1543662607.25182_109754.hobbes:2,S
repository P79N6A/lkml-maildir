I'm thinking of building a machine based around Sun's Netra AX-1105
motherboard, which I thought had a supported IDE controller built in,
but I could be wrong.

Oh, I'm just testing my newly compiled Sparc cross compiler :-), I
will be compiling for sparc64 eventually.  I've decided not to use any
Linux distribution on the new box, and instead just to build it up
from scratch, but at the moment, I'm still trying to build a native
Sparc GCC on an X86 box, (as opposed to a cross-compiler).
