Right thats why there is need for higher order allocs because that
increases the "queue" sizes. If the pages are larger then also the partial
lists will cover more ground. Much of the tuning in SLUB is the page size
setting (remember you can set the order for each slab in slub!). In
SLAB/SLQB the corresponding tuning is through the queue sizes.
