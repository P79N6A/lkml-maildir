Not necessarily (Yet, it doesn't. It's just a plug of what was _indeed_ 
corrected directly the like in kbuild-2.5.) But yet I'm confident we'll 
get that done, but we all (even Kai) will have to change our attitudes. 
However, I don't have prejudices for Kai, and I will try my best to get my 
work done.

If it goes on the like it did for now, you'd better wait for linux-2.8. I 
don't think it will get in like this.

The moment we merge Makefile-2.5 and Makefile, discarding compatibility 
targets.
However, try my linux-2.5.20-ct1, scheduled for somewhen until Wednesday. 
You can get a clear insight on some things such as kbuild-2.5 then.
