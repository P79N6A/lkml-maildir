I don't see any better explanation right now, so I guess we just revert 
that thing.
The only other notion I might come up with is stack corruption, ie the
code in pci_read_bases() might corrupt the return stack subtly (it does
add another local variable whose address is taken), causing a jump to a
random address on return. Compiler bug?
