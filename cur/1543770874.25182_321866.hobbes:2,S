As always, if the adapter is supported in the kernel, just select the 
menuconfig support and compile the source. If it's not in the kernel, 
then google and you might find a driver for it.
Simply google for "BGW200 Linux" or if you have a distro do like "BGW200 
debian"
PS: I don't think this is the place to talk about this.
I hope that helps.
