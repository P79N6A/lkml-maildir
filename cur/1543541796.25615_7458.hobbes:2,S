What is the minimal interface we can build into the kernel that will
allow people to experiment with all the ways they would like to do it,
so that we can harvest the resulting knowledge and build a sane/robust
system to carry into the future with us?
We have" the EA crowd with the data attached to the inode with size
	 limits (This seems to include acls) and if you think about it
	 we have a whole set of attributes we carry around in the
	inode now (all the stat stuff etc)
We have the arbitrary streams crowd.
We have hybrids who want some parts of both.
There are people arguing about
namespace
portability across nfs
implementations on different underlying file systems
Implementations in the vfs layer
Implementations in userspace only
Some hybrids again.
existing tool issues
security
stability
data preservation
Can we come up with something that will let us play with all of the
above to see what actually works well
