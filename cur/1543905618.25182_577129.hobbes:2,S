I'm trying to implement pwait.  It blocks until a specified PID exits,
  and then it exits.
You can use it to do other stuff after a program finishes.
While we're on the subject, is there some way to receive notification
  that some aspect of a process changes (in this case, stopping using
  CPU, but not exiting).
Thanks for the time to help me figure this out.
