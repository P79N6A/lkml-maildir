Yeah, we would end up eating about 12.5% more cachelines for contiguous
runs of pages... but that only kicks in after we've touched 8 of them I
think, and by that point the accesses should be very prefetchable.
I think the average of 75% more cachelines touched for random accesses
is going to outweigh the contiguous batch savings, but that's just a
guess at this point.
