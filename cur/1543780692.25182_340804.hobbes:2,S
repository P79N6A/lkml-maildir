That doesn't make much sense.  The slot number should at least be unique
to the chassis, if not to the whole machine.  HP's large machines with
multiple cabinets encode the cabinet number in the return from _SUN.
It ends up as something like 80103 for a large machine while still being
merely slot 3 for the smaller machines.
IOW, I think this is a firmware bug which needs to be fixed there.
