Another disadvantage is that ->readpage() can only do read-ahead within
single file, which is not helpful for the case of reading a lot of small
files (and this is what happens during startup).
And to implement reasonable multi-file read-ahead at the file system
layer one needs asynchronous inode loading interface implemented for
every file system.
