Hi
SuSe 10.0 (Kernel 2.6.13) crashes when booting my system with
 a Shuttle AN50R main board (AMD 64 processor). I am using 
standard runlevel 3 to avoid problems from the graphical system.
With the standard grub paramaters, the systems seems to boot 
fine and a login prompt appears. However, at this point the
system does not reply to actions form the keyboard and it 
does not reply to ping from the local net.
I have tried acpi=oldboot (no difference) and acpi=off 
(hangs at initialization of pci bus) on the command line.
Finally, I set all actions, that where not on 'ignore', 
to 'notify' in /etc/sysconfig/powersave/events; further, 
I increased the debug level to 31.
The only suspicious line in /var/log/boot.mst ist last one:
<notice>killproc: kill(25405,3)
/var/log/messages does not contain entries that look suspicios 
to me.
The rescue system works fine (includeing power down).
There are 2 SATA disks in the system. /dev/sda1 is for swap, 
/dev/sda2 for root; the remaining partitions are not mounted 
at the present stage.
Has anyone experience with this phenomenon or even a remedy for it?
