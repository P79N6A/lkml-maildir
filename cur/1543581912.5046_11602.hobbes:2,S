First of all, I'm object to calling OS/2 a "crummy system".  There are still
some things that OS/2 can do better than Linux.  But I don't want to get into a
flame war.  
More importantly, just because the drivers move into the kernel doesn't mean
that other OS's can't be supported.  A video driver could be compiled for the
kernel on Linux, but be compiled as something else for other OS's.  In fact, on
OS/2, a special driver is provided with XFree86 that effectively allows the X
Server to run with the same capabilities as an OS/2 device driver.  In fact, by
strict standards, it's a security and reliability loophole, but it still works
pretty well.
So I wouldn't worry about OS/2.  If we can port your audio drivers, we can port
anything.
xBSD, on the other hand, ....
