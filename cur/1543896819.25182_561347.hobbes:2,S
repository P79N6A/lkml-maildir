We intercept the sighand going out of business, and we do not access it 
anymore after that (by the mean of signalfd_lock() returning zero).
I'd be OK with Oleg patch, although I really prefer signalfd being more 
flexible (that is, with sync signals disabled in signalfd, and with Ben's 
patch reverted). Unless clear point of breakage are shown with such 
approach.
