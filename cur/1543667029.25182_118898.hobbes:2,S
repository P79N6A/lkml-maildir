Let's look at ext2:
	if (S_ISCHR(inode->i_mode) || S_ISBLK(inode->i_mode))
		raw_inode->i_block[0] = cpu_to_le32(kdev_t_to_nr(inode->i_rdev));
Should the saved device number be a 16bit or a 32bit device number? Has 
the user any control over it?

I mean via mknod, e.g. if the user has a major/minor number, how should it 
be converted to a dev_t number?
