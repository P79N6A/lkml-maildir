But what about USB or FireWire devices ? In theory, I'd like to see
the driver for those not have to bother about beeing hosted by a PCI
device or whatever else (there are typically non-PCI OHCI USBs on
embedded platform, faking a pci_dev is becoming painful).
So it would actually make sense to be able to pass whatever struct
device we are on, and have a real inheritance of the DMA functions
going down the bus, don't you think ?

And ? Where is the problem ? By default, you inherit from the parent
and that's just fine. The platform sets the ops for the root PCIs and
everybody below that inherit from them, same goes for VIO. If at one
level in the hierarchy, there is a "brake" (a bridge to a different
kind of bus that has additional restrictions), then the above routine
can "know" this via the new_dev bus type and setup appropriate mapping
functions.

Hrm... and we keep it empty for USB, FireWire, etc... or we add
platform_usb_xxxx, platform_ieee1394_* etc... for all those cases ?
