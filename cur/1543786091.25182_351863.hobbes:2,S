Hi!
I have a Supermicro dual Xeon board and boot from Hitachi SATA drive
connected to an Intel (?) onboard controller.
Using 2.6.12.5 the SATA drive was recognized correctly as sda via ata_piix.
Now I tried 2.6.13.2 and it's recognized as hdc and works very slow.
It's really disappointing to see SATA drive as hdc in a new kernel.
Actually, I think the bug existed earlier and an another bug made it
non-exposed until now. I mean that skipping probe at 2.6.12.5 output.
By the way, hdx naming had some advantages as you're not limited to 16
partitions like in sdx (it's important if you have solaris slices
recognized by Linux and have 20 partitions).
Thanks,
Maxim.
