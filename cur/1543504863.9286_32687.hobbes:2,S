I had a few questions regarding the aic7xxx driver.  I am working
with a specialized hardware that is running a custom OS.  We
will be using an Adaptec SCSI Host adapter and need to write
a driver, much like the one in Linux.  Our OS is very UNIX/LINUX like.
My questions are:
1. Will it be easy to port the linux aic7xxx driver (I know this depends
on the OS, but assuming that our OS has most Linux features
like delay, timing etc)?
2. What files will I need (Ex aic7xxx.c, aic7xxx_reg.h,
aic7xxx_seq.h etc)?
3. What of these files will require porting?
4. Any advise on the best way to do this?
Any advise is greatly appreciated.
Thank You!
Russ
