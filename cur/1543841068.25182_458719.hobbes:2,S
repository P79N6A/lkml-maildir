Subject: [PATCH 18/19] BLOCK: Make USB storage depend on SCSI rather than selecting it [try #5]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/29/221

From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
This makes CONFIG_USB_STORAGE depend on CONFIG_SCSI rather than selecting it,
as selecting it makes CONFIG_USB_STORAGE override the dependencies of SCSI,
causing it to turn on even if they aren't all met.
