Ah, that would be why, it's not one of the original nForce4 
(CK804/MCP04) chipsets, it's the newer nForce 430 (MCP51) chipset which 
doesn't support ADMA. NVidia said they'd be sending some patches to 
allow NCQ support on MCP51 and MCP61 chipsets back in October, but I 
haven't seen any, or information required to implement same..
