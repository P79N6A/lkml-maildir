Utrace doesn't provide any kind of watchpoint infrastructure now, and
utrace will take a lot of time to get ready for inclusion, mostly because
it really needs asll the arch maintainers to help out (and various not
so easy core fixes aswell).
I'm all for merging utrace, and I wish we'd be much further into the
merging process already, but blocking mostly unrelated functionality for
it is more than dumb.

This header is absolutely intentation as far too many folks seem to randomly
drop to or cc lines on mailing lists.  and of course it's alsmost esential
on lists with braindead reply to list policies (e.g. Debian)
