heh. As I mentioned in my other response, we're doing TCP/IP load
balance testing--so we need one linux system to act as many hosts. The
only solution, short of using bind/connect/accept/etc with non-local
IPs, is to use raw sockets (libpcap+libnet) and handle all of the TCP
protocol layer in userland. For speed reasons, that's clearly not
desireable, so I am seeking a kernel solution for acting as many hosts
(10,000+) without having to bring up network interfaces for each one....
Kind of sick, isn't it? :) In any case we will definitely be pushing the
2.4 network code to the extreme.
Regards,
Bryan
