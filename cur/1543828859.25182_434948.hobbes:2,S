Ok, I pulled, and pushed out, but this tree is really problematic: the 
authorship info has been dropped entirely, it looks.
Git tries to make it very easy to attribute patches properly (with command 
line switches to do it manually, but also with automated tools like git-am 
etc to do it automatically from emails), and has separate "committer" and 
"author" fields, exactly so that you can see both who did the actual 
patch, and who actually merged it.
The ieee1394 tree doesn't actually do that. Ben Collins shows up as the 
author for all of it.
Yes, the sign-offs look fine, but still, attribution and credit is 
_important_.
So for next time, please spend the effort to get attribution right, ok?
