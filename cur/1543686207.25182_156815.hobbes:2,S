Subject: patch: Parallel Port IDE Driver, kernel: 2.6.0-test3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Parallel Port IDE driver compilation error - driver/block/paride/pd.c
	In 2.4 the function blk_init_queue() in drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c, received the request_queue_t and the 
request_fn_proc pointers and returned nothing (void). The 2.6 kernel updated this function so it can receive the 
request_fn_proc and spinlock_t, returning the request_queue_t pointer.
	The driver hasn't implemented the new function yet, that's what the patch does.

- driver/block/paride/pd.c: fixed blk_init_queue() call and the pd_queue variable
