I'll make no pretence of reviewing any of this, but this has
indeed got mem= back working for me on a 2.6.28-rc9-mm1 - thanks!
I have to wonder if all this comes too late in the cycle for 2.6.29:
changing the early param handling of all the arches is difficult,
and apparently hasn't been much tested in the short time that it's
been out there in linux-next.  But of course, not for me to decide.
