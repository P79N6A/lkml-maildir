Excellent. OOM here I come.

Yep, pursuing this as well, also looking to add more RAM to the machine. At this stage
I was just trying to understand the numbers that I was seeing, so I could work out the
best way to proceed.
I'm using ext2 at the moment, on the assumption that the journal would cost 
me a bit of performance so I left it out :-)
I'll certainly try the other filesystems as you suggest.
Thanks again, Anthony
