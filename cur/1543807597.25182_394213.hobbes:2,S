Does normal mkdir() work?  If yes, it a problem in the way you wire the
syscalls up.  sys_mkdir is just calling sys_mkdirat.
Anyway, hold off on submitting code for the *at syscalls for a bit
longer.  I just found another problem.  Not a bug, but we must expose
the stat64 data instead of stat on 32bit platforms.  I completely missed
this in my patch.  The kernel's stat-related code is in almost a bad of
a shape as glibc's.
