No overclocking done, no overheating happening. All RAM memory checks
turn out just fine, with and without HT.

Well, the script itself was not how we noticied the problem. It was
created to see if the problem was reproducable. It was, during mentioned
conditions.
Regarding a possible race condition, the log file (md5log.*.lis) is left
for manual inspection if needed.
Following line will fix this (possible) event:
  AMNT=`awk 'length($1)==32 && $1!="91b82dcc83230890dbcdfc6b80571ddd"' \
    md5log.$PID.lis | wc -l`
