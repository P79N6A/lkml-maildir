Please fix your patch format per 
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html
Notably:
- Using "[PATCH] " not "PATCH: " in subject line.
- Don't repeat "[PATCH]" in text body, this must be manually edited out.
- This is English, not dashish.  Remove the dashes from the
  one-line description found in the subject line.  These must be
  hand-edited out, too.
