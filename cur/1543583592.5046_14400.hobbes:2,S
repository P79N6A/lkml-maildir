Hello, 
I'm using a Lifebook C 6185 with kernel 2.4.1 (unpatched).
Power Management is working fine in this version, but in all other versions
from 2.4.1-ac1 till 2.4.2-ac8 the systems hangs if it goes to suspend mode.
Is this a known issue? 
If not, I am a kernel hacking virgin, but if anyone could give me a hint, I
would try to fix this behavior.
Thanks in advance.
Daniel
