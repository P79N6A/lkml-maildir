Hi,
What is the meaning of Flags 0 in the /proc/net/rt_cache file appearing
after doing a ping on a local destination using interface eth0? How is
it possible to make the different tests allowing to know that the
destination is a host or a gateway with a 0 value :-( ?
Whereas for destination address using interface l0, non values appear ?
I am using the net-tools-1.50 package for a 2.2.3 kernel version.
Thanks for any help!
Simon.
