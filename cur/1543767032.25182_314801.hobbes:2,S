 Are you sure it's correct? I can't even mount with those options:
#v+
# mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/other -t vfat -o user,exec,noauto,utf8,noatime,sync,managed 
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1
       missing codepage or other error
       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail  or so
# dmesg | tail -2 
usb-storage: device scan complete
FAT: Unrecognized mount option "managed" or missing value
#v-
 Omitting "managed" seems to work. But it's slooow:
# dd if=/dev/zero  bs=1M count=100 | pv > /mnt/other/100MB
1,17MB 0:00:28 [41,7kB/s] [      <=>                ]
It stays at about 40 kB/s during all transfer. 
Reading is as fast as it should be = about 18 MB/s (after umount, mount
again, to clear cache). 
 My device is Kingston USB memory stick with USB 2.0, connected to USB
2.0 controller of nForce2 motherboard.
 Here's dmesg after plugin:
