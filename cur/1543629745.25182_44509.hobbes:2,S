NO.
This is one backwards compatibility thing that I'm _not_ removing.
We have tons of existign /dev trees, and I'm not making them into
symlinks.
Also, you obviously haven't thought it through AT ALL. Hint: partitions.
If you have /dev/hda1, that _cannot_ be a symlink to the physical tree,
because on a physical level that partition DOES NOT EXIST. It's purely a
virtual mapping.
Yet clearly there _is_ a mapping from /dev/hda1 onto the physical device
in question, and clearly it _is_ a meaninful operation to operate on the
physical device underlying /dev/hda1.
So if you want to have a sane interface, you need to have a way to look up
the physical device that underlies /dev/hda1.
Yet it clearly cannot be a symlink.
QED.
So stop mixing up physical devices and /dev. They should NOT be handled by
the same mechanism.
