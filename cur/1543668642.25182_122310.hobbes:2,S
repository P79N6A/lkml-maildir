With both patches, the kernel panics at boot time. With only my patch,
the framebuffer is initialised at 640x480. Console switching and X
work perfectly.
But if I try to change the video mode with fbset 2.1, the screen wents
blank after a console switch. I found no way to change resolution at
boot time ("video=radeon:1024x768-32@85" for example did not work).
