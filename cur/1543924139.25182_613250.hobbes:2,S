Unless the device also supports NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_FILTER, it has no idea
which vlans the kernel cares about, it's up to __vlan_hwaccel_rx().

yep.  bad csum on tx packets as reported by tcpdump is also an issue.

Yes, but it's more than just a packet socket issue.
A quick look through the hwaccel capable drivers (in 2.6.23) and most
are doing something like:
if (foo->vlgrp && packet_is_tagged)
  vlan_hwaccel_receive_skb(skb, foo->vlgrp, vlan_tag);
else
  netif_receive_skb(skb);
The important thing here is if the vlan group is NULL, the MAC must
be configured to NOT strip the tag.

*1:  Driver configures the MAC to strip TAGs even if vlan group is
     NULL. MAC strips the tag, but driver calls netif_rx() or
     netif_receive_skb() with the packet as untagged.  Kernel
     processes tagged packet as if it was received untagged.  Possible
     security issue.
*2:  If chip supports 'ASF', tag is always stripped (see *1 above).
     Looks ok if ASF is not supported.

Most likely, __vlan_hwaccel_rx() gets the whole 16bit tag and sets
skb->priority from on it.
Besides the accidental removal with the drivers listed above when
there is no vlan group registerd, we're still back to the original
issue.
Having __vlan_hwaccel_rx() send to the base device would likely
require a copy of the skb (at least the head). That completely defeats
the point of hwaccel.
At a minimum, __vlan_hwaccel_rx() should probably add the vlan header
back on if doesn't find a vlan device.  This way no copy is needed,
just shove the header back on (we already have the full 16bits).  Once
re-added, send to the base device instead of dropping.
That would fix the unknown vlan issue, but known vlans would only go
to the vlan device not the base device.  Not sure of an easy fix for
this as af_packet can specifically bind to a specified base device.  I
don't this this would be much of an issue and probably doesn't need
fixing.
