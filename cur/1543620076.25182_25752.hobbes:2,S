You fail to understand that the BUG triggering indicates that their is a
BUG _somewhere_ -- the triggered BUG is not the bug itself, of course,
that would be stupid :-)

The BUG is dangerous, because it means mapping DMA to a 0 address (plus
offset). Naturally there is no way in hell your "fix" will be applied,
since it a pretty bad bandaid.
A safer solution for you right now would be to just terminate the
mapping when you encounter this. So something ala
	if (!sg[i].page && !sg[i].address)
		return i;
That's not a bug fix either, but at least it's safer than your version.
Stock kernel won't be patched until the real problem is found, though.
