jeff, i am using a separate ipw2200 1.0.4 module with the proper hotplug firmware.
after i read this message i wanted to try your patch but during the
build i realized that you may have merged a different version (indeed
it looks like 1.0.0).
i don't really know what would be happened after reboot, using driver
1.0.0 and firmware for 1.0.4. i'd put a big notice in the help of ipw2*
modules about matching driver and firmware versions. mixing them is
probably a bad gift to your hardware.
yes, people should read those readmes.
cheers
domenico
