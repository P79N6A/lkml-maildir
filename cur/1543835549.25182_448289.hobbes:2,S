As far as I can see, acpi_cpufreq does not pass on any errors it sees during
init:
static int __init acpi_cpufreq_init (void)
{
        int                     result = 0;
        dprintk("acpi_cpufreq_init\n");
        result = acpi_cpufreq_early_init_acpi();
...
And from acpi_cpufreq_early_init_acpi():
static int acpi_cpufreq_early_init_acpi(void)
{
        struct acpi_processor_performance       *data;
        unsigned int                            i, j;
        dprintk("acpi_cpufreq_early_init\n");
	( some memory allocations, does not look at acpi or bios )
	
        /* Do initialization in ACPI core */
        acpi_processor_preregister_performance(acpi_perf_data);
        return 0;
}
Note how any error from acpi_processor_preregister_performance is ignored.
Ghetto patch which "fixes" the problem for me:

-       return 0;
+       return acpi_processor_preregister_performance(acpi_perf_data);
 }
But tonight I have no speedstep laptop available to check if this does not
kill acpi_cpufreq when it can work.
Thanks for the hint, dave!
