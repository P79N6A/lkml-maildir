yeah, this is OK. 20 is used for the watchdog thread, right? (so it has
minimal latency impact). What's the difference between prio 9 and 10
threads? You might want to map prio 9 ones to nice--15 and prio 10 ones
to nice--20, if there's a real difference between them. But for the
first test i'd suggest to use nice--20 for both. (to make sure
SCHED_OTHER tasks interfere as rarely as possible.)

'prio' cannot get negative here, so the first test is just as fine.
