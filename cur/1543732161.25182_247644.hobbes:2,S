It can't find anything outside a symbol in System.map, as it's
iterating over symbols in System.map. Special treatment for the final
profile buffer position is likely in order.

So the last read is always short, which is irritating; but bufcnt needs
to be ssize_t or the nonnegativity condition can never fail. Otherwise
it will report bogus results or terminate in a disorderly fashion if
the read() fails outright, e.g. running out of memory or interruption
by signals. So I propose the following alternative patch.
