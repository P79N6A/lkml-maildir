Okay, with -rc6 + genirq + the following patch, it appears to work
provided you don't stress it.  As soon as I load the system up with
CF activity, a full-sized flood ping and hit "enter" a few times on
the console, it locks up solid - no oops, no nothing, the machine
just completely freezes.
This does not happen with the existing ARM IRQ code.
I'll try to debug this odd behaviour later today, but first I need to
resurect my NMI oopser code for this platform.
