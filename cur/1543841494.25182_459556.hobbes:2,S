The vast majority of konfig user who might have a master in computer 
science (like our Aunt Tillie has) but aren't kernel hackers have 
different needs from kernel hackers.
I know how hard it is to e.g. find a maximum .config with FW_LOADER=n.
Normal kconfig users and kernel hackers have different needs, and the 
real solution fitting the needs of both groups would in this case be
a patch to kconfig that allows a kernel hacker to specify which option 
to deselect and does the rest automatically.
