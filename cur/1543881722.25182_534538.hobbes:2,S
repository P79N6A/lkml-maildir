The nice thing is if this was solved in the IOMMU code then we could drop
(or not initialize) GFP_DMA on systems with that hardware. I guess GFP_DMA32 
would still need to stay for the graphics devices though.
Not sure how much difference it would make though, but at least Christoph Lameter
seems to think it would.
