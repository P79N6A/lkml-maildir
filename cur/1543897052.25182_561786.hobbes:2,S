it's a tradeoff.
for cores/threads that share cache, there's no point to run a daemon 
all the time, they share so many resources that things don't really 
matter.....
irqbalance will, as a result, set up a one time static mapping and 
then exit on such systems; this will give a "reasonable" spread of 
interrupts, but won't cost you any cpu after that.
On "real" smp systems, the performance and power tradeoffs are 
different and there irqbalance will keep an eye on things over time...
