Subject: PCMCIA: Statically linked CF card driver?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/23/79

Environment:
* Embedded system, ARM platform, sa1100 processor
* Current Linux standard (or RT) kernel (2.6.12-something)
* Statically linked kernel, no module infrastructure and no initrd at
all
* Static /dev, no udev or devfs
* "hotplug" or card services not wanted
* sa1100 PCMCIA interface, PC Card / CF adapter
  (e.g. Kingston Model No. CF/ADP)
  (possibly other PC cards like WLAN, too,
  but a CF adapter is the only PC card 
  we really should officially support)
Question:
* Any chance to get the CF card working in that environment?
* Any chance to boot from it?
Wishes and non-wishes:
* It would be nice to be able to replace the CF 
  without rebooting.
* It can be assumed that the PC card CF adapter 
  is present during boot.
* There is no need to support hotplugging of the PC card CF adapter.
  (i.e. the PC card CF adapter could be treated as a static,
  builtin device, with its driver linked into the kernel).
Many thanks in advance for any help!
