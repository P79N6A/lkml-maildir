I should have mentioned that if you want to try my new PPP driver
(with the new pppd), you will need to do
mknod /dev/ppp c 108 0
If you use module autoloading and have PPP as a module, you will need
to add the following to /etc/conf.modules:
alias tty-ldisc-3	ppp_async
alias char-major-108	ppp_generic
