Subject: [RFC][PATCH -mm 0/3] Separate freezer flags

Hi,
The following three patches are related to the separation of the freezer flags
from process/threadinfo flags.
The first patch separates the freezer from the PM code, because it's no longer
a PM-specific piece of code.  This also makes the second patch look better.
The second patch introduces the freezer_flags field of task_struct, present
only if the freezer is compiled in.  All of the freezer-related flags per-task
flags are moved to this field and auxiliary functions for operating them are
defined in freezer.h .  This overlaps with the Gautham's work to some extent,
but I think it's better to introduce these changes independently of the CPU
hotplug code.
The third patch is a bonus. ;-)
Greetings,
Rafael
