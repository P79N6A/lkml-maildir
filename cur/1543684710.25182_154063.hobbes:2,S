akpm's kernel trees have the ide-dma patch that enables dma in raw mode. 
  Works quite nicely but i'd only use it on really prestine cds. DMA by 
it's nature doesn't give the best error reporting when dealing with raw 
data cds like audio cds. I've never had a problem with it though, even 
on cds with scratches.
