Get a better editor?
While I think 80 columns is a worthwhile goal, I don't see a good reason 
to wrap a random line only because it exceeds the limit by a few 
characters. What is especially annoying are patches with a one line fix
hidden within 10 other formatting changes (I've seen this already from 
you). Please respect others people code and try to avoid randoming 
formatting changes or at least keep them separate.
bye, Roman
