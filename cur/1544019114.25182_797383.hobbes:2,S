The biggest issue I have with this is that the whole "get_task_comm()" 
interface is not very good for random users - it inherently depends on the 
result buffer being at least sizeof(tsk->comm).
If we export it to random routines, I get the feeling that we should pass 
in the size of the result buffer, so that they don't have to know about 
this requirement.
