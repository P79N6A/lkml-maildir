I'm sorry, I don't exactly know what you want me to do... I'm not involved in
the linux net code and I did not even try to understand it yet...
I just have a small environment with a FreeBSD 4.6 box using my Linux box as a
NFS file server. This worked fine with my 2.4 kernel but with the 2.5.x test
kernels I've got the problem the FreeBSD box says 'NFS server not responding'
until I do simple pings (ICMP echo request, ICMP echo respond) to the linux box
(the NFS server)...
Letting the ping run all the time NFS works so stable I even can do lots of
compilations over it without any problems.
So I don't have any answer WHY this helps, but it does... Perhaps it really is
just a timing issue, I just don't know... If you can tell me what to measure and
which values would be interesting I'll do these tests and send you the
results...
