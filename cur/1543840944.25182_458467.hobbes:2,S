Yes, it should be.

I think non-srcu rcutorture patches can be merged in 2.6.19. srcu
is a tossup. Perhaps srcu and this patchset may be merge candidates
for 2.6.20 should things go well in review and testing. Should I re-submit
against 2.6.18-mm1 or so (after your patchset reduces in size) ?
What is a convenient time ?

GAh! cpufreq. Already I am having to look at all of cpufreq and the
cpufreq drivers, change notifiers for the whole locking model for
the other (hotplug) cleanup. I will keep this in mind.
