The reason why I posted is exactly so other ppl can look at it and find 
possible flaws in the way pages and retired. If an effective UID was able 
to see (or it generated) the data on that page, it should be able to get 
that page back uncleared (when VM_NOZERO is set).
From a performance POV, a 2-3% boost on a non-micro-bench test like a 
kernel build is not exaclty peanuts. And for more heavy malloc/anon-mmap 
appliations, the boost goes up to 10-15%. That is not exactly what I 
call "little time" ;)
