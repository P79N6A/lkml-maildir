Hello,
How are bug patches worked into the current stable release? For example,
the ext3 file corruption bug in 2.4.20, was that patch worked into the
kernel or will it be included in 2.4.21? I'm confused about the exact
details of this type of thing. If the patch was worked in to 2.4.20, how
can one tell as the release number doesn't/hasn't changed?
Please cc me on replies.
Thank you,
Brad
