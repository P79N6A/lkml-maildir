As i know, the (v)fat is organize in clusters. This clusters can be identified
by numbers. It's just an idea, but i think it's possible to 'map' this number
to inode number, because, they are 16/32bit long. At this way there is no
problem with changing inode number between reboots. 
Is it a bad idea ?
