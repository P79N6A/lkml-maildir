On ARMv6 (which can be SMP) the atomic swap instruction is much more 
costly than on former ARM versions.  It however has ll/sc instructions 
which allows it to implement a true atomic decrement, and the lock fast 
path would look like:
__mutex_lock:
1:	ldrex	r1, [r0]
	sub	r1, r1, #1
	strex	r2, r1, [r0]
	cmp	r2, #0
	bne	1b
	cmp	r1, #0
	moveq	pc, lr
	b	__mutex_lock_failed
With my ARMv6 implementation of arch_mutex_fast_lock() then it would 
become:
__mutex_lock:
	ldrex	r1, [r0]
	sub	r1, r1, #1
	strex	r2, r1, [r0]
	orrs	r0, r2, r1
	moveq	pc, lr
	b	__mutex_lock_failed
This code sequence is not possible with any of the standard atomic 
primitives. And the above would work even for the 
arch_mutex_fast_lock_retval() used for mutex_lock_interruptible.
Giving complete freedom to the architecture in implementing those could 
benefit architectures where disabling preemption while performing the 
lock instead of attempting any true atomic operation would be cheaper 
(Linus argued about that previously).  And if we are UP with preemption 
disabled then the lock could possibly be simplified even further if 
someone dare to.
But those implementation issues don't belong in the common core code at 
all IMHO.
