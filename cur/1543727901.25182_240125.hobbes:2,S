Interesting. How do you use those to grant someone access to a
particular CD writer device behind /dev/cam _without_ at the same time
granting them access to other SCSI devices too? I know that it's
possible with a trusted binary (like cdrecord) that's setuid root, or
that gets some priviledges some other way, but if that is the _only_
way, then that's a flaw in the CAM interface.
On Linux you can simply change permissions on the CD writer's device
node to allow non-root users to burn CDs.
