It _is_ bogus.

No idea, but that code is wrong.  Take a look at the original code
which patch 3692/1 removed.  You'll notice that it never touches
the mask/unmask handlers.

Shrug.  I'm explaining how _I_ designed it, and the purpose of it being
there.
If people insist on adding the mask/unmask crap to it, the function
might as well be deleted and be an alias for handle_level_IRQ.  Because
that's _precisely_ what you lot are turning it into.
Ah, and looking at the changes to the file, the addition of the mask
and unmask was done by someone who didn't understand what this was
trying to do.  So that change should be backed out.
