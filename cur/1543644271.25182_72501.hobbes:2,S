Thanks for pointing this out, I missed it.
Hm, if this is the code that the CG group is proposing for reliable
drivers, we are all in trouble.  See:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/
*checkout*/hardeneddrivers/sample_driver/src/sampledriver.h?rev=1.1.1.1
as a very small example of what not to do :)
I'd be glad to provide concrete criticism of the other files in this
directory, if I thought people would actually change their programming
style to follow what their own spec says to do...
{sigh}
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/
*checkout*/hardeneddrivers/sample_driver/src/sampledriver_init.c?rev=1.1.1.1
contains so many examples of bad style, and real bugs...
