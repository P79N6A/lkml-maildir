BTW, probably I miss something, but I wonder, how this RCU is working
here. E.g. in msg.c do_msgsnd() there is:
msq = msg_lock_check(ns, msqid);
...
msg_unlock(msq);
schedule();
ipc_lock_by_ptr(&msq->q_perm);
Since msq_lock_check() gets msq with ipc_lock_check() under
rcu_read_lock(), and then goes msg_unlock(msq) (i.e. ipc_unlock())
with rcu_read_unlock(), is it valid to use this with
ipc_lock_by_ptr() yet?
