Probably something a lot more complicated... if you can say there
is a "right way".

But the patch doesn't do that, as I explained.

Oh, maybe you misunderstand the reserve pools idea: that is an entirely
kernel based solution where you can preallocate a large, contiguous
pool of memory at boot time which you can use to satisfy your nommu
higher order anonymous memory allocations.
This is something that will not get fragmented by pagecache, nor will
it get fragmented by any other page allocation, slab allocation. Tt is
a pretty good solution provided that you size the pool correctly for
your application's needs.
