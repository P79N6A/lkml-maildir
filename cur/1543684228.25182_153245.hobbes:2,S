Thanks for including these patches. Here is one more that is needed to
make some old synaptics touchpads work.
When setting the mode byte, don't set bits that the touchpad doesn't
understand. Those bits are reserved and setting them can lead to
weird problems, like the left button not working, as reported by Miles
Lane.
