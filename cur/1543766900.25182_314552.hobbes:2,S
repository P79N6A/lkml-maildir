I said much the same in another post, but noatime is not always what I 
really want. How about a "nojournalatime" option, so the atime would be 
updated at open and close, but not journaled at any other time. This 
would reduce journal traffic but still allow an admin to tell if anyone 
ever uses a file. The info would be lost in a crash, but otherwise 
preserved just as it is for ext2. Might even be useful for ext2, not to 
write the atime, just track it in core.
