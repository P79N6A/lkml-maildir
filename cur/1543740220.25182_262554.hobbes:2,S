I agree with David here. It's also easy for arch/platform maintainers to
"miss" a new syscall too ... for various reasons, we can't all read
_everything_ that gets posted to lkml and we all do occasionally miss
some csets going upstream, which means we can very well totally "forget"
about addint the new syscall to the arch ... until somebody complains,
which can be 1 or 2 releases later !

Right.

Agreed,
