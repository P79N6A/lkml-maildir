see the buffer_busy macro defined later in fs/buffer.c for use by
try_to_free_buffers().  this will prevent protected ramdisk buffers from
being reclaimed, although they can still appear on the free list if
someone decides to add bforget() calls to the ramdisk logic...  presumably
if ramdisk decides to bforget a buffer, it doesn't care about it's
contents.
now, if you add this to bforget():
	buf->b_state = 0;
that defeats the buffer_busy check in try_to_free_buffers(), so maybe the
check should be made explicitly in bforget() if you add this line.
