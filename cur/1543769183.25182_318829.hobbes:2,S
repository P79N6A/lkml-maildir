My impression is that it is unlikely everybody will agree on a single
cluster setup anyways, so it might be best to use a similar strategy
as with file systems ("multiple implementations - standard API to the
outside world")
This would mean the DLM could be merged if the other cluster people
agree that the interface it presents to the outside world is good
for them too. Is it? Perhaps these interfaces should be discussed
first.
