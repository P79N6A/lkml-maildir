Dear Sir,
            	Investment Assistance
 I humbly approach you with a view that we may be able to enter into a mutual business transaction that could be of immense benefit to both parties. Foremost, I should begin by introducing myself.
 I am   Mr. Azziz   Bashir the son of late Mr.  Gaetiano Bashir, a precious stone merchant in Sierra Leone, who died in the year 6th of May 2001
After the death of my father, the Government of Sierra Leone arrested my mum and my kid brother on the allegation that my father was a front man to the late dictators of Sierra Leone. All my father assets were confiscated, by the present government and during this injustice; my brother and my mum were maltreated and tortured. From this trauma, my mum fell sick and died. After the whole incident, I went through my fathers document and I found out that he lodged $12 000,000.00 (twelve million dollars) with a security vault before he died, out side my country and he intended investing it before his untimely death.
 Sir, my intention now is to invest in your country, in any profitable business you deem fit.
 I will be grateful if we come into joint business partnership. Because of my family background I shy away publicity. Precisely, I prefer staying away from well know public figures in any country. Hence I won't want my name mentioned to any one, as I still want to stay away from the scrutiny of my country government. Mentioning this mail to anyone may put me in a big mess and cause me to lose the money. As soon as I receive you consent I will immediately forward the contact and all other information of where and how to collect this money
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Thanks
Mr. Azziz Bashir
