Subject: [patch 00/32] xen: Xen implementation for paravirt_ops

Hi Andi,
This series of patches implements the Xen paravirt-ops interface.
It applies to 2.6.21 + 2.6.21-070428-1 + the patches I've posted over
the last couple of days.
Changes since the last posting:
 - update per review comments
   - comment each file
   - comment barrier use
   - use common cpu sibling setup
 - fixed a few minor bugs, specifically a traceirq mismatch warning
 - some xenbus cleanups as a result of my review; more coming
 - split xen-core into more pieces
These patches are now moderately well tested, with several successful
runs through XenSource's regression test suite, and some amount of
non-me testing.  While I wouldn't go into production with a
xen/paravirt_ops kernel right now, it does seem pretty functional.
This series generally restricts itself to Xen-specific parts of the
tree, though it does make a few small changes elsewhere.
It includes:
 - some helper routines for allocating address space and walking pagetables
 - Xen interface header files
 - Core Xen implementation
 - Efficient late-pinning/early-unpinning pagetable handling
 - Virtualized time, including stolen time
 - SMP support
 - Preemption support
 - Batched pagetable updates
 - Xen console, based on hvc console
 - Xenbus
 - Netfront, the paravirtualized network device
 - Blockfront, the paravirtualized block device
Thanks,
	J
