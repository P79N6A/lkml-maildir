No, I mean: *really* doesn't have a problem. If Andrew says ext2 doesn't
need i_mutex in reclaim, then I tend to believe him.

I guess the memory deadlock issue is probably mostly theoretical, although
it is still nice to get them fixed. I'd imagine a deadlock condition -- if
one really exists -- could be hit without much problem though. Page reclaim
will readily get kicked from the write(2) path, and will potentially free
*lots* of stuff from there.
If it isn't a problem for you, I'd suspect it might be due to some other
conditions which happen to mean it is avoided. For example, the inode who's
i_mutex you are holding will have a raised refcount AFAIK, so it will not
get reclaimed and so may get around your problem.
This would be a valid solution IMO. It probably could do with documentation
to outline the issues, though.
