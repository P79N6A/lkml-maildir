I've seen similar triggers on sparc64 from a reporter, but
it was NFSD and slab poisioning in the backtrace in that case.
I think the common denominator is the presence of very busy kernel
daemons unable to schedule out to let other tasks (and in particular
the per-cpu softlockup daemon) onto the cpu.
Looking at KNFSD specifically, I don't see anywhere that it tries to
yield the cpu if it's been working for too long.
I guess that's exactly what the softlockup thing was meant to catch
:-)
