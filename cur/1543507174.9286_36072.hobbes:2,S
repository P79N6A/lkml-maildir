vmalloc implementation is a lot simpler, I just did it based on Russel's
patches, and it's plenty enough for what we need (I don't think a driver
will ever need more than one page uncached anyway). I added a definition
for PAGE_UNCACHED. I currently use a #ifdef PAGE_UNCACHED to export or
not vmalloc_uncached from vmalloc.c, but this is a temporary solution so
I can make sure my eth. driver works.
