ACK, but that's designed to work against a DoS, not against cluttering the 
log. The messages I want to suppress are low-frequent.
I now realize that some of these warnings may be triggered by userspace, 
and since userspace-triggered warnings are a possible DoS, these parts of 
code should be rate-limited, too. I think it's best to include a 
rate-limit check in my printk_nospam to make it work against slow log 
spamming _and_ DoS.
