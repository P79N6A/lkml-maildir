I like the idea of a filesystem.  In particular, if you exposed the CPU 
state as a mmap()'able file, you could read/write from userspace without 
any syscall overhead.
There are some clever ways that you could get around need that many 
syscalls.  For instance, you could have a "paused" file that you could 
write a "1" into in order to run the guest (assuming that the memory/CPU 
state is setup properly).
You could then have an "event" file that you could select() for read 
on.  When "event" became readable, you could read the exit reason, do 
whatever is needed, and then write a "1" into "paused" again.
Perhaps an ioctl is better for pausing/unpausing but I do think it's 
necessary to select() on something to wait for the next exit reason to 
occur.
