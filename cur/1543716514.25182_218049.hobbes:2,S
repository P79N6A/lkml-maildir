OK, make that a per-node level, a per-8-nodes level, and a global
level.  ;-)  The per-node level might or might not be helpful,
depending on your memory latencies.

The potential problem with less-frequent processing of callbacks is
that it would result in larger "bursts" of callbacks to be processed,
degrading realtime scheduling latency.  There are some patches that
help avoid this problem, but they probably need more testing and
tuning.

My thought was that each CPU was already reading jiffies several times
each tick anyway, so that it would already be cached when RCU wanted
to look at it.  But I must defer to your experience with this particular
machine.
