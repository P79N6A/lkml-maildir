If merge took trees instead of single files, and had some way of detecting
renames (or it got additional information about the differences between
files), would that give BK-quality performance? Or does BK also support
cases like:
orig ---> first ---> first-merge -
 |                /               \
 |------> second -                 -> final
 |                \               /
 |------> third ---> third-merge -
where the final merge requires, for complete cleanliness, a comparison of
more than 3 states (since some changes will have orig as the common
ancestor and some will have second).
Does this happen in real life? It seems like sane development processes
wouldn't have multiple mainline-candidate patch sets including the same
patches, if for no other reason than that, should the merge fail, nobody
with any clue about the original patches would be anywhere nearby. It
seems better to throw something back to someone to rebase their diffs.
Otherwise, the problem seems to boil down to finding the common ancestor
well, getting trees instead of files to merge, and improving merge until
it handles all of the tractible cases.
