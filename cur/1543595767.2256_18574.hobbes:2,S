For device drivers it tends to be very useful because people often mix and 
match a base kernel and older/newer drivers. But it can certainly be
KERN_VERSION which is KERN_DEBUG type level

Actually that one matters. Its important to tell people they have broken
quota code and should do something about it ;)

Q: Would it be worth making the module author/version strings survive in
a non modular build but stuffed into their own section so you can pull them
out with some magic that we'd include in 'REPORTING-BUGS'

For the networking credit for the university - nope. Its hard to quantify what
it gained the university but it isnt something to throw away lightly. Its
as real in its nonfinancial way as reiserfs is important financially to 
Hans and that he is known to be its author.
I've no idea what the position on vendor copyright printk messgaes is, 
certainly if they are copyright strings and count as such I think you need
to discuss the matter with the boards of the companies concerned.
