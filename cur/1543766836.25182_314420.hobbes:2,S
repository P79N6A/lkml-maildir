So in effect, the delivery of the suspend/membership distribution/resume
events are three cluster-wide barriers?
I can see how that simplifies the recovery algorithm.
And, I assume that the delivery of a "node down" membership event
implies that said node also has been fenced.
So we can't deliver it raw membership events. Noted.

Agreed. This is something I noticed when I looked at how the DLM fits
into the global cluster resource management architecture, too.
For example, if you talk to Stephen ;), you'll be told that every
cluster resource is essentially a lock. But, our resources have complex
dependencies, start/stop ordering etc; a DLM which tried to map these
would blow up completely.
So, we have the "top-level" "lock manager", our CRM, which manages these
complex "locks". However, it's also worth noting that there's rather few
of them to manage, and they don't change very often.
Now, the DLM has simpler locking semantics, but it manages magnitudes
more of them, and faster so.
If you want to think about this in terms of locking hierarchy, it's the
high-level feature rich sophisticated aka bloated lock manager which
controls the "lower level" faster and more scalable "sublockspace" and
coordinates it in terms of the other complex objects (like fencing,
applications, filesystems etc).
Just some food for thought how this all fits together rather neatly.
