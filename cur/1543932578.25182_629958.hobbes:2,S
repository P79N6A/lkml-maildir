preempt-rt can disable interrupts for 300 us?
If so, then I guess there's really no way to avoid a few overruns.

If you do, you just need to switch to one of the USARTs instead of the
DBGU so that you can use DMA :-)
We need to fix the break- and error handling though. But my vacation
starts tomorrow, so I probably won't be able to fix it until next year.
