Subject: Re: [patch 2.6.16-mm2 3/9] sched throttle tree extract - remove IO priority barrier

This patch removes the barrier preventing IO bound tasks from competing
against highly interactive tasks for cpu time.  This barrier has been
demonstrated to cause starvation of IO bound tasks, and in testing, I've
found it to now be unnecessary in any case.
