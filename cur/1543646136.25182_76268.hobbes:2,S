That was 2.5.39 + bk from just before .40 hit the streets.
I'll pull something current in a tick, and give that a shot.

theres usually not too much going on on the laptop.
It runs enlightenment + gnome 1.4. A few gnome-terminals,
and thats about it. After bitkeeper had sucked down a few
changesets and started its "lets grind the disk for a while"
consistency thing, interactive feel is approaching nil.
Trying to focus a different window takes about 5 seconds minimum.
Switching desktops takes 30 seconds minimum.
My completely unscientific guess here is that bitkeeper is
whoring all the I/O bandwidth, and we're trying to swap at
the same time, which is getting starved.
I'll try and reproduce after some sleep with vmstat running
if this will be of use.

Ouch.

Depends on what tests are I suppose. "springier" doesn't
really say too much. We do minimise memory usage in a few
places if mem<16M though iirc which could be helping this case.

Hmm, my case seems to be everything you say should not be happening
any more. Sorry 8-)
I *can't* be the only one seeing this though.
The laptop disk is no speed demon, but its quite nippy at ~12MB/s
For obvious reasons, having swap and / on the same disk is making
a considerable impact here.
