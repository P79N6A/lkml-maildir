Taken from "lspci -vvv".
The computer is an HP Pavilion ze4145 notebook. Most of the devices do not
have corresponding PCI ID's in the kernel, but I am only worried about the
NIC right now.
00:12.0 Ethernet controller: National Semiconductor Corporation DP83815
(MacPhyter) Ethernet Controller
             Subsystem: Unknown device 3c08:2400

             Status: Cap+ 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I've had this notebook for 6 months
and cannot use the network card under Linux. I tested it with Windows and
OpenBSD and the network card works fine under both.
