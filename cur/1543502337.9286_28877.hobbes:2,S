What? They need an RT kernel, not a timesharing one.

Sure.

Which doesn't mix well with timesharing.

Lots of overhead for no good reason. If you need a RT - take a RT kernel
and don't mess with TS ones.

It's not a bug, it's a feature. "Optimize" will mean "screw normal usage".
Optimizing for RT != optimizing for TS. Ditto the other way round. They
should take RT-Linux or QNX, if they want RT. <looking at their page>
Oh, dear... Looks like marketdroids decided that popularity of Linux means
that they should use it and to hell with technical arguments. And managed
to convince PHBs. Paint me cynical, but... Methink they are in for a big
screwup.
