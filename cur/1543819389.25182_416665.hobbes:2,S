Agreed, with the caveat that mediating all those things comes with
expense, and AppArmor doesn't mediate them by design, because our goal
is to keep the host from being compromised by a hacked application, not
to control all information flow. Different goals produce different designs.

Also agreed, and also caveated that the general purpose system emulating
the simple system is much more complex than the simple system itself,
and simplicity is a critical part of secure design. In this case, the
most expensive impact on simplicity is the complexity of the policy that
users have to manage.

Mediating by file names rather than inodes is the fundamental place
where we disagree. I am delighted with LSM, because it allows us to
disagree without having to fight about it.
