yep, Brian is right. I've uploaded -D2:
        
http://redhat.com/~mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-O1-2.5.2-D2.patch
other changes:
 - make rt_priority 99 map to p->prio 0, rt_priority 0 map to p->prio 99.
 - display 'top' priorities correctly, 0-39 for normal processes, negative
   values for RT tasks. (it works just fine it appears.) We did not use to
   display the real priority of RT tasks, but now it's natural.

(doh, done too, fix is in -D2.)

nothing serious, my main problem with it is that it's often too long for
my 80 chars wide consoles, and it's also too long to type and i use it
quite often in SMP code.
IIRC we had a 'hard_smp_processor_id()' initially, partly to make it
harder to use it. (it was very slow because it did an APIC read). But
these days smp_processor_id() is just as fast (or even faster) as
'current'. So i wanted to use cpu() in new code to make it easier to read
and to make it more compact. But if this is a problem i can remove it.
I've verified that there is no obvious namespace collisions.
(i've done a quick UP sanity compile + boot of 2.5.2-pre9 + D2, it all
works as expected.)
