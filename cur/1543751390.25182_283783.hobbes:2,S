Don't think it got discussed on l/k. Dunno if its in the 2.6.10bk code
yet either
        rq->errors = 0;
        if (!rq->bio)
                goto out;
                                                                                
        rq->sector = rq->bio->bi_sector;
        rq->current_nr_sectors = bio_iovec(rq->bio)->bv_len >> 9;
        rq->hard_cur_sectors = rq->current_nr_sectors;
        rq->buffer = bio_data(rq->bio);
out:
        return ret;
Is how the code should look at the end of ide_dma_timeout_retry (plus
your rq == NULL check I imagine)
