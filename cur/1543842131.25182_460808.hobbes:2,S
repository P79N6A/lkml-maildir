I presume you're talking about the sizes of the types.  Inside the Linux
kernel:
	sizeof(void *) == sizeof(unsigned long)
must always hold true.  There are too many things that depend on it to do
otherwise.

Pointers are just numbers that are used in a particular way.  Go and look in
linux/err.h:-)

At the moment, maybe, but they could always change it.  And what about Reiser4?

Is this part of the condition actually necessary?  Can you not guarantee that
this will always be true?

igrab() might fail.  I would recommend doing it before calling iget5_unlocked()
and drop the extraneous reference to lower_inode afterwards if the eCryptFS
inode returned is already set up.
You're also casting lower_inode twice.  Whilst there's nothing actually wrong
with that, it might look better if you assigned it to its own variable at the
top of the function and only do the cast once.

You shouldn't need that any more.  Just leave the read_inode op pointer unset.
The NULL pointer exception handler will let you know if anyone tries to access
it (which they shouldn't - only *you* should call iget*() on your own inodes).
Looks good otherwise.  Just the igrab() thing is a real problem.
