I can confirm this.  I have a machine that has been hiccuping with the out
of memory (for inetd) for several versions now.  Absolutely nothing in
the logs to explain it.  A crontabbed 'free' shows the machine *always* has
free memory available.
Note, In my case it complains about swap pages.  Swap is never used on this
machine.
dmesg:
----
swap_duplicate: entry 0a6a0806, nonexistent swap file
swap_duplicate: entry 0a6a0806, nonexistent swap file
swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
Out of memory for inetd.

On this machine, it normally happens once within a day or two of bootup.  I
haven't seen it happen anytime other than that.
