hi,
we have a system with 4G, however, only approx 1G will be used.
dmesg issues the hint "use a PAE enabled kernel". silly question,
but how do I PAE enable a kernel? I have found a lot of messages
about PAE enabled kernels on the net, but not *how* to enable this
feature.
any hints please?
thanks in advance,
herbert
