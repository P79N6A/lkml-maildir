Of course you can. You'll need "just" DEEP rework of VFS as was discussed in
depth here. And still it's not a panacea: if you'll pull floppy EXACTLY when
write/read process going you can just mechanically break floppy drive (just
like plugging/unplugging SCSI or IDE device: probability is of the same order).

I repeat as well: It should be done right or not at all.

Why I need dialog ? In case of linux pressing of eject button can iniciate
umount process and then eject. If umount failed I'll not get my zip drive
and will find and kill offending process.

And you answer is bad. Here owner of /dev/fd0 is always "root,floppy".
Root is VERY rarely loggin in. All trusted users are in "floppy" group.
Now: who should get message about wrongly removed floppy ?
P.S. Do not answer: I know that right way is to say daemon somehow that
"messages about /dev/ide/host0/bus1/target1/lun0/* should go to /dev/console
while messages about /dev/scsi/host0/bus1/target7/lun0/* should go to
blah.blah.blah:0.0" or something. That is: you need LOTS of changes in
kernel AND you need ifrastructure in user-space. Is it reallyworth it ?
God knows. So far I'm see hackish solutions which will punish user when
user doing mistakes. Not a way to go IMNSHO. If someone REALLY want this
behaviour he should sit and code prototype of all infrastructure. Complete
with changes in kernel, daemon is userspace and so on.
