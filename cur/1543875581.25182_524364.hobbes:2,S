Checking the benchmarks on various hardware websites, anandtech, 
hothardware and others, they generally all come to the same conclusion if 
there is only 1 thread using I/O (single user system) then NCQ off is the 
best.  I see 30-50MB/s faster speeds with NCQ turned off on two different 
SW RAID5s.
