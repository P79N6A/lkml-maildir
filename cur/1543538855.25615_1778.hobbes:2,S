The new VM subsystem will be available as a series of
"new VM sneak preview" patches. I'll make sure to give
you one which is stable and works well enough that we
can integrate it into 2.4 later on (eg at 2.4.10).
Since VM is basically a performance issue, I don't think
we should let it hold up 2.4 release. Sure there are some
minor stability issues in extreme cases, but no more than
with 2.2 VM.
regards,
Rik
