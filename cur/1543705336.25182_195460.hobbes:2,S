Another thing I just saw - you've got quite a lot of memory in
buffers which might be something going wrong.
When the build finishes and there is no other activity, can you
try applying anonymous memory pressure until it starts swapping
to see if everything gets reclaimed properly?
Was each kernel freshly booted and without background activity
before each compile?
Thanks
