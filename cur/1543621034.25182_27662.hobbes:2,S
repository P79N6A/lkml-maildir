I think that the suggestion from Jeff Garzik, that there is currently 
just too much of code
duplication for quite common cases in drivers is the right way to go. 
Most of the
stuff doing the virt_to_phys is doing quite common things from a broader 
point of view.
Well even worser, there is quite a lot of code replication there as well 
...  see for example the
ide and scsi midlayers ;-). The whole hostadapter/iobus/device stuff 
handling could be made common
at least. There is no real need for different driver handler lookup 
mechanisms between them.
HWIF(device)-> and Scsi_Host_Templ come into mind...
