Do you mean paging in general or thrashing?
I always thought: paging good, thrashing bad.
A good effecient paging system, always moving data between memory and disk,
is great.  It's when you have the greater than physical memory working set
that things go to hell in a hand basket.
Did Linux ever do the old trick of "We've too much going on!  You!
(randomly points to a process) take a seat!  You're not running for a
while!" and the process gets totatlly swapped out for a "while," not even
scheduled?
