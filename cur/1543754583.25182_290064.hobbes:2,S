Sorry about that. I suppose it's just used a lot as a shorthand for 'unsigned
int', which is used a lot more in the kernel (the above command finds 22656
occurrences). On a sidenote, however, wouldn't it be nice for things like this
to be consistent throughout the kernel? Don't think I have an opinion on this,
because I don't, but I'd like to see those of the ones who do.
