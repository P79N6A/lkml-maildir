Hello,
Is there some howto information available about using PCI riser cards
(with multiple PCI slots) under Linux?
Several incarnations exist of PCI riser cards with two PCI slots where
the Device Number of one slot can be changed.
How, based on what information, does Linux assign an IRQ to each card,
plugged into the riser?
How can one tweak/influence the irq routing?
How can I make a dual riser card work so that both cards have a working
interrupt?
Or if stuff should work all by itself, what could be wrong?
Kind regards,
Udo
