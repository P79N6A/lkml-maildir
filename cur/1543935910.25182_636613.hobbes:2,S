So I looked at the code - it seems you build a full extent of the blocks
in the file, filling holes as you go along. I initally did that as well,
but that is to slow to be usable in real life.
You also don't support sparse files, falling back to normal fs
read/write paths. Supporting sparse files properly is a must, people
generally don't want to prealloc a huge disk backing.
