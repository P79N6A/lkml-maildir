2.<even>.x are "stablizing" kernels, where (theoretically) only bug
fixes are accepted. But the code hasn't been through any QA cycle at
the moment of release. It is still a developer release in any
traditional software development definition.
I am quite impressed that Linus hangs on to the initial x.<even>
series until it becomes close to production quality. Notice that an
important user (google) came up with a severe error very late in the
day and Linus held things up for a few weeks until that was cleared.
Notice the months long struggle to decide on a VM solution. In this
cycle, it took maybe ten months to shepard 2.4.0 into something of
excellent potential that is a real step forward from the 2.2 series.
 Everyone who participated can be proud.
