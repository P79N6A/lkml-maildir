No. Have you verified this? If you 'dd' your swap partition from /dev/zero
on IDE, you'll see write performance closely matches read performance, for
drives old and new.
In the case of small transfers, the drive can hand them off to the on-drive
write cache (2/8MB usually). The only case where IDE disks will be 'slow' for
write performance is where you have no disk I/O scheduling and lots of small
reads/writes - this case wins on SCSI, but many modern IDE disks and
controllers also have tagged command queuing, so it is even more of a corner case.
