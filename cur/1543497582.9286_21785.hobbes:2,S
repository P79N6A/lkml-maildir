I agree that #2 and #3 is needed, although I disagree about it being a
major pain. It's just that nobody ever wrote anything I found acceptable
(all the patches I ever saw thought they should re-create the broken MS
documentation about PnP).
#1 should be a non-issue these days, and in fact works already (and ISA
stuff should just use exclusive irq's, and then request_irq() will give
you the information - and if you are sane and don't need exclusive
interrupts the whole issue is moot anyway).
