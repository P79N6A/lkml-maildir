If that's a fundemental rule then we need to expand our horizons to
something a little more flexible .. I understand what your saying, I do,
but it doesn't apply to this change or clocksources . The reason I think
that is because the potential is ~100 drivers or less, once you reach a
critical mass of drivers there's few if any to be added .. So from my
perspective there no reason to overly simplify the structure..
