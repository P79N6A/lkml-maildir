Hm, a bit.  First, have you looked at what sysfs provides?  Here's one
of my machines and tell me if it has all the info you are looking for:
$ tree /sys/bus/scsi/
/sys/bus/scsi/
|-- devices
|   `-- 0:0:0:0 -> ../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:05.0/host0/0:0:0:0
`-- drivers
    `-- sd
        `-- 0:0:0:0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:05.0/host0/0:0:0:0
$ tree /sys/block/sda/
/sys/block/sda/
|-- dev
|-- device -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:05.0/host0/0:0:0:0
|-- queue
|   |-- iosched
|   |   |-- antic_expire
|   |   |-- read_batch_expire
|   |   |-- read_expire
|   |   |-- write_batch_expire
|   |   `-- write_expire
|   `-- nr_requests
|-- range
|-- sda1
|   |-- dev
|   |-- size
|   |-- start
|   `-- stat
|-- sda2
|   |-- dev
|   |-- size
|   |-- start
|   `-- stat
|-- sda3
|   |-- dev
|   |-- size
|   |-- start
|   `-- stat
|-- sda4
|   |-- dev
|   |-- size
|   |-- start
|   `-- stat
|-- size
`-- stat
Now, from that you can see exactly where my scsi device is in the pci
tree, and you can see in the block directory, what block device is
assigned to what physical device in the device tree.  Then there are 4
partitions on this disk, all what those specific paramaters.
So, when sda shows up, udev can determine that it lives on a specific
scsi device, located in a specific place in the pci space, and that it
has some number of partitions, all of specific sizes, wich specific
major/minor numbers.  It can then create all of the /dev links based on
this.
Please, take a few minutes looking at the existing sysfs tree on Linux.
If you then have any specific questions, I would be glad to answer
them.
Hope this helps,
