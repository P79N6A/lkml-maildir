Subject: [PATCH] voyager: fix bogus conversion to per_cpu for boot_cpu_info
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/26/326

There were two problems.  Firstly, someone forgot the struct keyword in
front of cpuinfo_x86, so I take it this wasn't even compile checked.
Secondly, the actual definition has this as a SHARED_ALIGNED, so the
definitions mismatch.
