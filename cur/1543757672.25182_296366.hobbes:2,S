 which include up to 2.6.10 level.

I use 2.6.11-rc1-mm1. I'll check out the /proc/fs/cifs/ stuff next
time i get a problem. It isn't so much reconnection issues, it's if
the connection is completely lost for whatever reason it tends to put
the processes to uninterruptible sleep. It's as though it doesn't
actually return an error, but instead waits until it can access the
file again, even when the filesystem is umounted.
