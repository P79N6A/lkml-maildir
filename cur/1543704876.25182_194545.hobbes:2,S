Well, read() is a bad example for that -- errors are always going
to come back straight away for a read.  write() is a better example.
I'd really like to hear from someone who's done this kind of thing before.
Are there any actions worth taking when an error occurs *other* than
taking the card offline and notifying the user?
If there are, Linus' interface is probably the best one.  If not, we could
simply have readX_check() / writeX_check() call dev->driver->unregister()
if they notice an error has occurred and then the driver doesn't even
need to call read_pcix_errors().

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
