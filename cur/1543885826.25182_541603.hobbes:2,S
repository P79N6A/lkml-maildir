Is there any reason why a driver shouldn't be able to handle probing
several devices at once? What if two devices become hotplugged at the
same time? Does this imply that the bus _always_ needs to do some
serializing there?

Yeah, I saw this back then. But this is much too inflexible. How do you
determine the settings? On a large system, you could throttle too much,
obliterating most of the benefits of the parallel approach; on a small
system, you could overwhelm the system.

Hm, I think "asynchronous" is the key word here, not "multithreaded".
Thinking some more of it, we really want to do the following:
- look at the device:
  - do the fast stuff
  - kick off the slow stuff
- look at the next device
  - ...
- wait until all devices said they are finished
- each device needs to signal completion when the slow stuff has been
done (or hit a timeout)
(By some curious accident, that is what s390 cio does :))
This way, we are much more flexible than with the execute_in_parallel()
approach. This async approach especially looks suited to stuff where
some kind of operation is submitted to the hardware and we need to wait
for an interrupt/completion. And for that kind of operations, it scales
equally well on small or big machines.

Maybe the criterion should be more "a resonably unified set of
devices". s390 channel attached devices are really all the same (at a
certain not driver-specific level), and the same may be true for
something like scsi. pci may be just too diverse with too many
dissimilar drivers.
