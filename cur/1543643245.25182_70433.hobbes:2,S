I was afraid of that :P I see it with 2.4.20-pre{5,6}, 2.4.19 (I think),
and 2.5.32. It's a Toshiba Portege 2000, and I guess that means that
something excitingly wacky is happening with the interrupt hardware.
linux-kernel cc'd in case anyone there has ideas.
I did do some instrumenting inside the bluez code, and it appears to
lose the plot within the serial code somewhere - but not necessarily on
any given call into there. The behaviour is quite odd - for example,
starting an l2ping will immediately lock out the keyboard and mouse, and
the first ping response will show an RTT of ~5500 ms, following which
the remainder will come back within ~45ms. If I leave l2ping running
while restoring the keyboard and mouse by switching in and out of X,
they'll almost immediately freeze up again and there'll be another ~5500
ms burp in the l2ping replies.
