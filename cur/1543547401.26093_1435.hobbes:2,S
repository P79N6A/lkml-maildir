MTBF is something that's only of value when identical things are compared,
1000 of those things are tested, and some statisticall data is calculated.
With PC, the're just to many factors that play a role.
I think it's safe to assume that with proper management downtime is less
than an hour on a yearly base. Downtime is mostly cause by upgrades, both
hardware and software. These are values I actually present to customers.
