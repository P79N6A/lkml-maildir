hi,
okay. i've had no experience in debugging kernel errors so i
apologise in advance for all the information i've failed to report.
i'm running linux-2.2.0 with no extra patches on a redhat-5.2 system.
the cpu is a pentium-II 266.
this error has happened 3 times since i've been using this kernel (i
forget when it was released - nearly a month?)
from /var/log/messages:
Feb 10 06:30:00 appc-keith kernel: Kernel panic: VFS: argc is wrong
there are no other error messages in the file.
the only cron job i have set up for this time is cdplay.
this morning there was no cd in the cd player. not a good enough
reason to crash out the whole system, id've thought.
the kernel was compiled using pgcc if thats any help.
thanks.
keith.
