Subject: How to use SCSI tape during Rescue boot

Environment:  Linux 2.0.36   RedHat 5.2
When configuring a new system under previous RedHat
releases, I used to create a complete backup of the
file systems (/, /usr, /tmp, and so on) on a
SCSI HP 9GB Tape. Fine.
In case of system crash, I had the possibility to boot
using the boot and root floppies, mounting the file
systems under /mnt, /mnt/tmp, /mnt/usr and the
copying back the backup tape. By the end, a simple lilo
installed the boot configuration on the new target disk.
With RH5.2 this is no longer possible. I created a boot
floppy using mkbootdisk. Then, using this floppy, I
answered during lilo prompt recovery. Fine. At mount
root filesystem I inserted the rescue floppy obtained
from CD-ROM. 
This environment recognize all the hardware components
but the /dev/st0 is missing from /proc/devices
So I am not able to reload the backup. I can turn around
this problem mounting a disk a creating a mirror copy
just in case. But the tape solution is better and cheaper.

Thanks
