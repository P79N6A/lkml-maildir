Hi list,
I have some trouble getting my network card to run.
when I run dmesg I can clearly see it being detected
eth0: VIA Rhine II at 0xee006000, 00:e0:c5:54:88:a8, IRQ 11.
eth0: MII PHY found at address 1, status 0x786d advertising 05e1 Link 45e1.
but when I try ifconfig eth0 up it fails with a no device error.
SIOCSIFADDR: No such device eth0:
ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device
I tried adding pci=routeirq too, but that didn't work either.
I know there is nothing wrong with the card itself because it works on
the linux distro that came with it.
does anyone have any hints as to what might get it up and running?
Thanks!
Mark
I attached a complete dmesg output just in case..
