I'm just trying to keep locking expectations in the previous, similar
path, in block/ioctl.c, blkdev_ioctl, where we setup q->blk_trace:
        case BLKTRACESTART:
        case BLKTRACESTOP:
        case BLKTRACESETUP:
        case BLKTRACETEARDOWN:
                lock_kernel();
                ret = blk_trace_ioctl(bdev, cmd, (char __user *) arg);
                unlock_kernel();
                break;
So I took the safest path and grabbed the big K lock.

Looking forward to that. And will get it split into multiple patches,
hopefully by monday.
