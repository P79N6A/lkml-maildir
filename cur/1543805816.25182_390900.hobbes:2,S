I agree that Eric's approach likely improves performance on large systems
due to decreased cache thrashing.  However, the real problem is getting
both good throughput and good latency in RCU callback processing, given
Lee Revell's latency testing results.  Once we get that in hand, then
we should consider Eric's approach.
It might be that Lee needs to use -rt CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT to get
the latencies he needs, but given that he is seeing several milliseconds
of delay, I hope we can do better.  ;-)
						Thanx, Paul
