I don't think this function should be here. This indicates that
lots of writeout is happening due to pages falling off the end
of the LRU.
There was a bug recently causing memory estimates to be wrong
on Opterons that could cause this I think.
Can you send in 2 dumps of /proc/vmstat taken 10 seconds apart
while you're writing at full speed (with 2.6.13 or the latest
-git tree).
A dump of /proc/zoneinfo and /proc/meminfo while the write is
going on would be helpful too.
Thanks,
Nick
