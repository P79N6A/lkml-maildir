Alternatively, you might try a system where each "hard-device-wait"
gets a specific interactivity rating, the default would be 1.0, but one
could specify that /dev/input/mice gets a rating of 10.0.  Then when
handling inter-process communication, a wait on IPC connected to
some local program would cause a change in interactivity rating
based on the current interactivity of the other process. EX:
gpm waits on /dev/input/mice, gets a high interactivity rating.
X waits on /dev/gpmdata, gets a lesser but still significant rating.
This clearly has some flaws, but it may be useful in some scenarios.
