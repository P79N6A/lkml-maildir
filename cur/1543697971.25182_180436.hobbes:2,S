One more observation:
This time i wrote two shell functions, one for the user and another for 
root. I placed them in the .bash_profile
for root
z()
{
    touch /tmp/createdbyroot
}
for user
z()
{
    touch /tmp/createdbyuser
}
I then reproduced the problem, and during the alternation of the 
prompts, when i was on the user prompt, i ran 'whoami' and it showed me 
as a normal user. Then i ran 'z'. I expected the filename in /tmp to be 
'createdbyuser' but it is actually 'createdbyroot' !!!
