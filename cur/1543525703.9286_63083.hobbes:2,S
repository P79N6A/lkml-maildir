Hi,
in 2.3.44, struct net_device (include/linux/netdevice.h) was changed
(specifically, the members 'start' and 'tbusy' were deleted), but quite
a number of network drivers have not been updated accordingly yet.
As an example, the DEC Tulip driver in the 'normal' tree
(drivers/net/tulip.c) has been updated, but its PCMCIA counterpart
(drivers/net/pcmcia/tulip_cb.c) has not.
