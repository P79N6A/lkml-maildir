I find it very odd indeed with IBM's big voice of open source
praise, yada yada, and what Lou has said in the past, that there
would be any question at all of wether it would be open source or
not.  Isn't big blue behind open source?  Or is it just for
publicity?  Makes me wonder now...
Must be some real good rocket science in that interface that
theres no way on earth someone else could come up with it for it
to be important IP to protect.  Makes me wonder what's hiding
behind it...
