Don't get me started. It was a stupid decision, and it just never got
fixed because it was never painful enough to warrant fixing.
I might accept a patch that just moves the pipe struct to outside the
union, but for 2.2.x there is no point in trying to clean it up to be
dynamic like somebody did - that should have been done back in the
development series rather than now. 
Even just moving the pipe structure sounds like something for 2.3,
actually. As it is, it's just pretty ugly, not actually buggy.
