unreasonable test, especially on a machine with 1gb ram/swap.  For reference,

I guess this testcase is somewhat driving in the direction of Martins test with
some setis running, meaning it has a lot of standard processes that need files

-j story and give us a result? I attached it for an easy go :-)
