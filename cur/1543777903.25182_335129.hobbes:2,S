This looks like some sed command went wrong. And I missed that you were 
starting a comment here.

Yes, that was the problem. I would prefer if you could just remove the code 
instead of commenting it out. This would have made this clearer.
If my editor doesn't fool me you are using spaces for indentation of the 
while. There has to be a tab.
Question to the sparc folks: is it really needed to preserve the order of the 
ebusses? Or would it be possible to do
pdev = pci_find_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_SUN, PCI_DEVICE_ID_SUN_EBUS)
first and if this returns NULL start again with 
pdev = pci_find_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_SUN, PCI_DEVICE_ID_SUN_RIO_EBUS)
?
