As mentioned before, since people had been wanting another old release,
we (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.13.5 kernel.
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.13.4 and 2.6.13.5, as it is small enough to do so.
The updated 2.6.13.y git tree can be found at:
 	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/linux-2.6.13.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
	www.kernel.org/git/
thanks,
greg k-h
