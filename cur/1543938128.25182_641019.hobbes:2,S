You are right.. it should be that overall energy usage is higher with 
clock throttling.

It reduces the rate of power usage (watts), however it will likely not 
decreate or even increase the energy usage (i.e. watt-hours) of any 
given computational task.

Clock throttling is not likely to save your battery, unless you have 
tasks that are running at 100% CPU for an unlimited time or something, 
and you force your CPU to throttle. Normally most people have tasks that 
run and then the CPU idles - loading an email, displaying a web page, 
etc. Clock throttling will just make these tasks utilize the CPU for a 
longer time proportional to the amount clock throttling and therefore 
negate any gains in battery usage.
