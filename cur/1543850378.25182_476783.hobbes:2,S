This is read by the cachefilesd daemon and fed to the module prior to the
start of the caching.

Okay.

Yes.

The module lets the VFS DAC and MAC stuff check that root has writable access
to the cache dir and will also do checks of the xattr if it's there already.

Okay.

That sounds reasonable.  There has to be some way to revert it, though.

That makes it sound like fscreate is a per-process attribute, not a per-thread
attribute.  The former would definitely be a problem.

Sounds feasible, I think; but I still need to revert the change I imposed.

I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Can you give a pseudo-code example?

You make it sound so simple:-)
