It is a well known problem to me, the 601 CPU doesn't like the 'mftb' call in
arch/ppc/kernel/time.c. Attached a patch which made my 7200 boot again. It is
from Takashi Oe. Don't know if it will go into the main tree. I already asked
Paul M.
But in the meantime you can play again with your 7200.
Good luck
