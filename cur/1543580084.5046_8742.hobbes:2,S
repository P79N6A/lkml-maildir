I am trying to add some drivers to kernel 2.2.16
and I think I have everything done right except
that when it tries to compile the driver I get an
error message saying that EXPORT_SYMTAB is not
defined.  How do I fix this?  I have added a target
to the Config.in and I have added what I think to
be appropriate lines to the Makefile (to check
the config vars defined in Config.in) but I still
get the error.  Any help is greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Mike
