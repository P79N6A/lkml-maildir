There used to be a Dumb Algorithm(tm) in there - basically, gcc went through
all decompositions of constant it was multiplying at and it did it in the
dumbest way possible (== without keeping track of the things like "oh, we'd
already looked at the best way to multiply by 69, no need to redo that
again and again)").  _That_ is what blew the build time to hell for a while.
And yes, that particular idiocy got fixed (they added a moderately-sized
LRU of triplets <constant, price, best way to multiply on it>, which killed
recalculation from scratch for each pointer subtraction and got complexity
of dealing with individual subtraction into tolerable range).
That's separate from runtime issues, of course.
