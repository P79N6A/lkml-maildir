Not from me. I use "git diff" just to check that the tree is empty, and 
the fact that it now throws me into an empty pager is irritating.
That said, "LESS=FRS" doesn't really help that much. It still clears the 
screen. Using "LESS=FRSX" fixes that, but the alternate display sequence 
is actually nice _if_ the pager is used.
Still, I think I'd prefer FRSX as the default.
