Subject: Setting the source MAC address in sent packets

The AF_PACKET interface allows you to set the destination 
MAC address directly when you send it, but as far as I can
tell, the source MAC address is fixed to the interface.
How can I set this (I want bridge IPX packets between
two networks *without* changing any of the headers at
all) from a userspace program?
