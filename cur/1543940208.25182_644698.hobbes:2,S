It looks like firewire is doing the right thing, unregistering the fw* device, 
and the SCSI layer is subsequently removing the appropriate /dev/sd* nodes, 
but for whatever reason, md hasn't a clue this has happened. I can reproduce 
this particular part of the problem by bringing the array up, and then simply 
pulling the firewire cable on one of the drives in the array...

That does appear to be the case. If I reconnect the drive I disconnected, 
which was originally /dev/sdb, it comes back up as /dev/sdd now. So 
apparently, the scsi layer is at least bright enough to see that someone (md) 
is still trying to use /dev/sdb, but I'm clueless as to why md doesn't have 
any idea that /dev/sdb actually went away. :\

Certainly sounds like a feature we'd benefit from having in this particular 
case...

Very true... Perhaps I'll just file this one away a bit down the TODO list for 
now... ;)
