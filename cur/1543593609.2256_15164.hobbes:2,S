*sigh*
Not to prolong an already pointless thread, but that really was the
intent of my original message.  I had figured out a specific way, with
easy-to-follow steps, to make the VM misbehave under very certain
conditions.  I even offered to help figure out a solution in any way I
could, considering I'm not familiar with kernel code.
However, I guess this whole "too much swap" issue has a lot of people on
edge and immediately assumed I was talking about this subject, without
actually reading my original message.
