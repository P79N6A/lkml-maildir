These are not really "attributes" so much as they are "metadata", for
example, a "contents" subdirectory, if one existed, would be based on
the original file, and therefore non-unique, but would be looked up
based on information about the original file.

Agreed.  I discuss this more below

Absolutely.  On the other hand, that's not to say it can't be improved.

Also, unlike a symlink, if the path doesn't change and the file does, it
will break, also, if the file is removed and another created  
elsewhere, it
will be redirected improperly.  Perhaps a new symlink syntax is  
needed to
allow attribute specification (Ick, more changes :-\).

"meta" seems the more descriptive name.  There should also probably be a
somewhat standardized location for this, such that programs can  
locate it
without much trouble.  This mechanism would be usable from all FSs, and
could be built into the VFS.  Also, it would allow one to access the  
meta
data of meta data (if supported by the filesystem, and possibly only
through the file descriptor lookup, due to numbering limitations.)

other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.
