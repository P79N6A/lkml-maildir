Well, you're developing / maintaining this right now, so it's your
call. Though I bet most people would find keeping that list_add_tail
local to scan.c more tasteful.

I wish you'd commented it better than "This function returns zero in
case of success and a negative error code in case of failure." in that
case :-)

Again, you're developing and maintaining this right now, so it's your
call. Though it would be easier on you if you remove these exceptions
that could be quite easily removed, actually.
