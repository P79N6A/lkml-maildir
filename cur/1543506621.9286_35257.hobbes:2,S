From a brief look at the last version of the international patch I've got,
I'd expect that if you don't have module support, (menu|x)?config will let
you say y, but nothing will be compiled:
+ifeq ($(CONFIG_CIPE),y)
+MOD_SUB_DIRS += cipe
I'm using cipe 1.3.0 now, which, AFAIK, isn't in the international patch
yet.
