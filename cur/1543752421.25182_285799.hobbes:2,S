Thanks a lot for keeping us informed.
Too bad you did not tell us you had the possibility to use the ISA
access in the first place. It is well known that ISA access is more
reliable than SMBus or I2C.
It also might explain why MBM was working without a problem. I suppose
it was also using the ISA interface, same as you do now.
