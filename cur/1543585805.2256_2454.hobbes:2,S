Hi!
I've been trying to get Wake on LAN working under kernel 2.4.2 with a 3COM
3c905C-TX card, standard 2.4.2 drivers, I have manage to get it working, but
only if I don't compile ACPI and I don't load the network card driver, as
any of this things make the Wake on LAN not work. APM and other features
don't seem to affect the card waking, but this two really break it.
Is there any plan on solving any of this for the future?
Is there anything I can do to help get this working?
PS: cc me as I'm not on the list.
Regards..
