Not really. Steps 2 and 3 can be done by simply calling pci_dma_sync_single()
with the appropriate direction flag.  I don't understand why a 
pci_dma_sync_single() is needed after the device does a DMA from the 
buffer and before the CPU writes a command.  After the CPU writes data to the
buffer, it can do a pci_dma_sync_single(..., DMA_TO_DEVICE), which causes
a cache flush. Isn't this what we're already doing today?  Why do we need 
to do a cache flush before the CPU writes data into the buffer which is
then immediatelly going to be flushed?
