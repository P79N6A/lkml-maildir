The default is to do a hard-mount of NFS shares.  Hardmounts hang when the
server disappears.  This is... Generally what you will want.  adding the
intr option should allow the processes to be killed (but I have not tried
this)

Count yourself lucky.  I was foolishly serving webpages from an NFS
mount.  Fortunately apache has limits.  Seeing a loadavg in the the hundreds
is... disturbing.
The loadavg does this because processes in the D state get counted wether
they are doing anything or not.  I don't know if this is correct or not, but
most unicies seem to do this.

Not incorrect, but you might experiment with soft mounts, which will rapidly
timeout and die with io-errors rather than hanging.
