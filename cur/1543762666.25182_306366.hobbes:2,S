Dunno.  Haven't gotten around to sorting that out yet, and I don't
particularly fancy trying to fight any corners over it.
I think, a while back, it was thought to be better to keep ARM separate
to keep the conditionals out of drivers/Kconfig.
If the general concensus has changed, I might eventually sort it out if
it causes enough trouble, or people think there's sufficient value to it.
