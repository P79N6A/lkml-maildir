Hmm.. I wonder if the thing should disable the queue (plug it) and release 
the lock before calling reset. I assume we don't want any new requests at 
this point anyway, and having the low-level drivers know about stopping 
the queue etc sounds like a bad idea..
Of course, I suspect that it is potentially a bad idea to have the reset
functionality at the SCSI level _at_all_. As usual, the higher layers
don't really know what is going on, and the lower levels on smarter cards
are likely to be doing the right thing on their own, no?
(Yes, we should improve the infrastructure for having per-command timeouts 
etc, but the reset/abort callbacks have always been strange)
