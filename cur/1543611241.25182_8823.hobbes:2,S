ok, I doubled checked things. It seems mounting an ext3 filesystem as
ext2 is somewhat a myth. If the kernel supports ext3 it still mounts it
as ext3 even if /etc/fstab says ext2. When I tried 2.4.16 with ext3
support, but with the journal exactly removed to make it a ext2
filesystem the --rebuild worked just like it does in 2.4.9-13. So it
does seem to be a problem with just ext3, and I guess they changed the
journaling of atimes between the version in 2.4.9-13 and 2.4.16. It all
now makes sense. Thank you for your help.
As for my comment before and Rik's VM vs AA's VM on cache agressiveness,
it looks like I was off. It just seems to vary on some dynamic. I
thought I checked them at the same points after boot, but between
different boots seemed to get different results, who knows.
