Hi Timo,
Thanks for your report!

2.6.20 works, 2.6.21 doesn't, right? You could try git-bisect on Linus'
tree (if you can use git) to find the offending commit that broke it:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html
and
http://www.reactivated.net/weblog/archives/2006/01/

(long URL broken in 2 lines)
You don't need to "make clean" between git-bisect builds, but be
prepared to lose a couple of hours on this still :-)

Others have reported problems booting with gcc-4.2-compiled
kernels too. Could you try building with 4.1?

You're saying there are no modules, then how come those three
are loaded? Also try reproducing the problem without proprietary
(nvidia) drivers, please.

As mentioned earlier, git-bisect could help us narrow this down.
It's not a silver bullet, but often useful.
[ BTW, just-after a new kernel release is often an unlucky period to
report bugs, it appears ... everybody gets busy with not missing the
merge window to push in their shiny new stuff :-) ]
Thanks,
