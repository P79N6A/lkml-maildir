Oh, that's not the problem, I use the debian's kernel-package
build-system
. The problem is that the affected box is about the only box
where I really don't like downtime because it handles my
internet connection, email and telephony.
Besides from that I am currently trying to find the last working
kernel-version, since 2.6.24.6 shows the same problem.
I am currently running 2.6.24.5 again. Let's see if that runs stable.
When I have found a stable kernel I think I will bisect it, but I am
quite busy currently so it could take a while. Who knows, maybe it's
not the kernel's fault at all but some strange kind of hardware failure.
