If you're a nongamer, almost anything will work. Intel's integrated
graphics is pretty well supported even with 3D (and better than most in
2D), and Intel documents their hardware. It helps if you have one of the
newer dual-DDR-400 setups, since the Intel stuff is UMA and will eat
main-memory bandwidth.
The ATI R200-based cards tend to work well with DRI too, and are typically
higher performance than the integrated chipsets (ie you can actually play
most games comfortably).
