To be clearer. And you are wrong: you can write other modules which
want to know what the LCD is showing, or use it; without worrying
about framebuffer things. They can read / write "cfag12864b_buffer" as
well as cfag12864bfb do. Why not?
The cfag12864b module is the real driver, which uses ks0108 module.
The cfag12864bfb is just the framebuffer device.

Right, I saw that in the meantime I was adding the mmap feature. Thanks.
