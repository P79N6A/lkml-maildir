	You can't do that. The restriction is not imposed by the law, it's imposed
by the the copyright owner the instant he added an effective technological
measure to protect copyright to the GPL'd code.
	GPLv2 code *cannot* contain any license or copyright enforcement
mechanisms. It can contain code that appears to be such a thing only
provided that the legal position is not that it's such a thing.
	For example, you can make a kernel that will refuse to load kernel modules
that aren't licensed under the GPL. But you cannot prevent anyone from
removing that logic if they want to.
	*If* you add a license enforcement mechanism to some code or *you* declare
that existing code is such a mechanism, then *you* are imposing the
additional restrictions.
	The idea of it being imposed "directly by the copyright owner" is just
something you made up. The GPL does not distinguish between direct and
indirect impositions. In fact, it goes out of its way to make it impossible
to indirectly impose additional conditions. See, for example, section 7.

	Again, see section 6. If you cannot allow unrestricted modification, then
you cannot comply with the GPL. If you cannot comply with the GPL, then you
do not get the rights the GPL might give you. If you need the GPL to give
you the right to distribute, and you cannot comply with the GPL (even though
it's through no fault of your own), then you cannot distribute.
