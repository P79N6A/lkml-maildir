I cannot back this statement. Though my machine has 1 GB RAM I did the
make in a situation where countless processes were running amongst    
them mail-client, Mozilla with several windows, seti, numerous xterms,
all in all 16 desktops full with this and that. I'd say it was a bit  
more than 600 MB free (meaning cached of course). But I have only     
256MB of swap. During the make a damn lot of paging was going on and  
swap went from 70 MB up to about 210 MB, but that was it. Load was    
around 154 at top. As the thing was over all came back to normal and  
bzImage was working.                                                  
I did not see any problem.                                            
I will drive mem down to around 400 MB tomorrow for another test.
