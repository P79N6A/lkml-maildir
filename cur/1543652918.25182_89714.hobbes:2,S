Whats the status of the CMD680 driver in the 2.4 and 2.5
kernels?
Seems like it is in the later 2.4, but removed from the -ac
line, and missing from the 2.5 tree.
I'm not iterested in the raid function, just would like to
use it as a pure raw ide controller.
Y, cheap and crap hw, but currently there is no way to buy
other than that in .hu
