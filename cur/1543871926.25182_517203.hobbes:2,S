I know, I am sorry. We could use family as in:
rinfo->is_mobility && rinfo->family != CHIP_FAMILY_RS480
Another solution is to add "default_dynclk" to radeonfb_setup
so that everybody with a rs480 can disable it.
I don't have the register specification for the 200m (RS480) so I don't
know why enabling "dynamic clock pm" doesn't work.
