Further nvnet musings (cc:ing Jeff as net driver maintainer and 
knowledgeable person).
As I reported here a few days earlier, I tried using the AMD8111 driver 
with my NForce2 ethernet a few days ago, with the result that no MAC 
address was being assigned to the card. I suspect that the MAC address 
is being assigned by the Nvidia driver. Does that make sense?
If so, then using the option in the BIOS to manually set the MAC address 
might make the AMD driver work. Unfortunately, I have no idea what I 
should set it to without stomping on the MAC address for other devices.
Any ideas? I hate to rely on a binary only module for something as 
"simple" as a 10/100 ethernet card.
Thanks,
Rahul
