Hi ! 
In the last days I  found a "funny" message block in /var/log/messages : 
Feb 16 00:15:24 DeepThought kernel: Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown
reason 3c.
Feb 16 00:15:24 DeepThought kernel: Dazed and confused, but trying to
continue
Feb 16 00:15:24 DeepThought kernel: Do you have a strange power saving
mode enabled?
What does this exactly mean ??
And I have some other problems , again . 
For the ~ last three weeks  had no! system crashes ( Thats enourmous for
my system ) .
But now there are again strange problems : 
I´m scrolling a file in kedit( from kde) and the system freezes .
No reaction from keyboard , mouse or anything else , no entry in any log
file . 
The system simply freezes .
Why !? 
And my third problem is an entry in /var/log/messages : 
Mar  2 14:06:22 DeepThought kernel: bmap 80
Mar  2 14:06:22 DeepThought kernel: result 1331c0
Mar  2 14:06:22 DeepThought kernel: bmap of 2eaa,block 80 is 1331c0

.... to be continued for several pages ...
Whats this ? 
Okay , I think that are enough questions for one mail !
Thank you for your help !
