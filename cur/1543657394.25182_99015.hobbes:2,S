Hi Margit,
you should enable preemptive kernel logging only if you selected preemptive 
kernel.
In the case of preempt logging turned off, the show_preempt_log() function 
should evaluate to an empty function
#define show_preempt_log()	do { } while(0)
as defined in <linux/sched.h>
Best regards,
Jörg
