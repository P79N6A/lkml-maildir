That is indeed a very good question.
If you use node interleaving you end up with memory accesses to be
distributed matching the amount of memory installed on each node.
Assuming that processes prefer the first node you get better performance
with load < 1 and memory usage < $first_node_memory.
If you use a NUMA configuration you should get better performance from
almost equally distributed memory. Especially when the load goes up.

PS: I choosed NUMA with equally distributed memory.
