Easily?  As in write my own system call wrappers?  And how is UML intimate
with the system calls, anyway?  It is no more intimate with the host's
system calls than any other app.
It also uses some smaller higher-level pieces of libc (printf early in boot,
readdir et al in hostfs, etc).

Maybe, I'm not expert enough with the linker to do that.

My current thinking is that I will bundle all the userspace code into a
single object which then gets linked (-r IIRC) against libc.  That should
resolve all libc references, at which point I can link it into the kernel,
and I think there won't be any conflicts.
