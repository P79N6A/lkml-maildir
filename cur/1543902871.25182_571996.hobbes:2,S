Jesper, Thank you very much for your comment.
I applied the comment and added a few translated part changed
for 2.6.22. (ie. Git URLs for each subsystems)
I made an updated patch against Greg's one as same as Munehiro.
Due to my email software issue handing UTF-8, I'd attach it. sorry.
For your convenience, Here is top part of the patch.
