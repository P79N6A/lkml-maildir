Whenever it stops working I follow this sequence, which you can match
to the logs.
1) Exit cu by ~.
   - if this does not work
       try \r~.
       - if this does not work
          Send SIGHUP, (which so far always worked)
2) Start cu again
   - if it prints leftover characters
     exit cu again by ~. and continue from step 2)
3) If it still not works and hangs again
   - for a few tries  
     unplug PL2303, wait a second replug and goto step 2)
4) If it still does not work
   - Remove PL2303, unload and reload usb (all) and
     plug PL2303 again
   - If module unloading fails, or interrupts died 
       (no response to plugging) > reboot
