For now it does ignore them. But that's something to work on
for later versions of lguest64.  I want lguest out in the public and
working for the general case. I don't plan on ignoring the paranoid

want the debug stuff working. But I also need to walk before I can run ;-)

Ah, OK, I assumed you were talking about just the previous code. But
rereading your post, I see it was more general.  Sorry, for the
miscommunication.
