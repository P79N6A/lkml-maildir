You can download the broken-out version of the -mm and use quilt.
Quick start:
- unpack the tarball in a directory containing vanilla 2.6.18-rc4 sources,
- rename 'broken-out' to 'patches'
- use 'quilt push n' to apply the next n patches,
- use 'quilt pop n' to revert the last n patches applied,
- 'quilt applied | wc' gives you the number of patches currently applied,
- 'quilt top' returns the name of the last patch applied.
Greetings,
Rafael
