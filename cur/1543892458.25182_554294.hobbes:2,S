If your linker is doing its job then you won't be able to link them
together because they have incompatible assumptions. Not exactly rocket
science even if it is done a little differently to the usual symbol
compatibility tests.

And the stuff you are trying to put into the kernel is better ? No, its a
bunch of ugly hacks caused by trying to solve the problem in the wrong
way and in the wrong place.
