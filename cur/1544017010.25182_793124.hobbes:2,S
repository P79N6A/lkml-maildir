This adds, what?  40 or 64 bytes to the task_struct?  Consuming more memory
and worsening the kernel's cache hit rate.
It would be nice if the changelog were to contain comforting words
which allow us to believe that this is all worthwhile.
Perhaps it is time to allocate all this accounting stuff separately
from the task_struct?
Can ixrss ... cisrss be placed inside #ifdef CONFIG_TASK_XACCT?

erk.  Please implement all these in C.  It's nicer to read, doesn't
evaluate the same expression multiple times and provides compile-time
typechecking.
Only implement in macros those things which *must* be implemented in
macros.

Yes, K() is a bit silly.
Perhaps this is a sufficiently common operation to justify implementing
it in printk() itself.
	printk("%pK", &r->ru_ixrss))
(I think).
This would require that the passed-in number be consistently either
32-bit or 64-bit, and we'd have no compile-time checking for this, so
maybe not do this.
