I think either keeping it separate, using your own structure, or
properly splitting out the  counter / time-clock interface would be the
way to go.

Just so I understand, do you mean clocksource_read_ns() returns the
number of nanoseconds since the last call to clocksource_read_ns() ?
That seems like an odd interface to define, since effectively you're
storing state inside the interface. 
Why exactly is this useful, as opposed to creating a monotonically
increasing function which can be sampled and the state is managed by the
users of the interface?

So a monotonic 64bit wide counter. Close to what I described above. Is
there actually a  need for it to reset ever?

Yea. It seems like an odd interface, as the internal state seems to
limit its use.

Right, but if its a monotonically increasing 64bit counter, rollover
isn't likely an issue. I think we're basically communicating the same
idea here, just the question is do you want to make the interface
provide nanoseconds or cycles.

Hmm. I'd still prefer those values to be stored elsewhere. As you add
state to the structure, that limits how the structure can be used. For
instance, if cycles_last and xtime_nsec are in the counter structure,
then that means one counter could not be used for both timekeeping and
the hardware time-stamping you're doing.
Instead that state should be stored in the timekeeping and timestamping
structures respectively.

Right, however my point quoted below was that this will likely break in
the -rt kernel, since those users may be deferred for a undefined amount
of time. So we'll need to do something here.

Well, I think it would be good to create a infrastructure that will work
on most hardware. 
And I think it can work, but in order to make it work cleanly, we'll
have to have some form of accumulation infrastructure, which will not be
able to be deferred.
However, some careful thought will be needed here, so that we don't
create latencies by wasting time sampling unused hardware counters in
the hardirq context.

Ok. I'll have to spend some more time on that patch, but it sounds like
you're handling the issue.

Err, you might be misunderstanding their current meaning. However, its
not your fault, as the naming is not as clear as I like.  For instance,
xtime_nsec stores the sub-nanoseconds (shifted up by clocksource->shift)
not represented in the xtime value.
So yes, while you likely want to keep similar state as the timekeeping
core does, I really think splitting it out fully is going to be the way
to go.
Thanks for the consideration of my comments! I look forward to your
future patches!
