I think he is concerned about the _official_ 2.4.15 and the _official_ 2.5.0,
because, subsequent patches for 2.5.0 will not _cleanly_ apply on 2.4.15 tree
(although fixing them should be extremely trivial).
Can somebody confirm that the difference is only the version numbers in the
Makefile, and no other changes in Documentation/ etc?
Cheers,
Anuradha
