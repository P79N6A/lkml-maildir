I reported SBP-2 problems with 2.6.0-test11 (somewhere around 28
November). With 2.6.0 the problem still persists. I just tried it again
with the latest IEEE1394 drivers (r1088 / SBP2 r1085) but I still get
logging time out errors on my CD-RW drive.
With 2.4 it just works as it should and I get both my CD-RW drive and my
MO drive.
Under 2.6 SBP2 just somehow does not want to play ball with my CD-RW
drive.
