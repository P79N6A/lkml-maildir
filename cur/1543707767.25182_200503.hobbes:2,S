So? The above has absolutely nothing to do with "dma_alloc_coherent()". 
Also, it is wrong. It is not necessarily guaranteed that the device that 
is the host controller ha sanythign to do with the "bus->dma_supported" 
thing.
The point is, that DMA is always _always_ done on the host controller. 
Trying to make things look any different is silly and wrong.
THE ABOVE CODE IS CRAP!
The correct thing to do is
	int usb_dma_supported(struct usb_dev *dev, u64 mask)
	{
		struct device *host = dev->root_hub->controller;
		return dma_supported(host);
	}
and anything else is FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG!
Imagine, for example, that the bus is a PCI bus, but the USB host 
controller has a bug in that it only supports 24-bit DMA. Asking for what 
the bus of the host controller supports is non-sensical, and has 
absolutely zero to do with that the actual host device supports.
See?
(That actual bug is totally irrelevant, though. The _fundamnetal_ bug is
in your way of thinking. For one thing, if you have a function called
"usb_dma_xxx()", then it takes a _USB_ device, not a generic device.  
Because the function clearly doesn't even WORK with a generic device, it
only works with a "struct usb_dev". So don't "lie" about things like that
in your interfaces and confuse the issue).
