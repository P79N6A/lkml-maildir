No, there is something very wrong in md/bitmap.c's handling of writing
to a file.  It was developed for, and tested on, ext3 and doesn't seem
to work anywhere else.... and I don't understand enough to fix it.
Help ???
What md/bitmap wants to do is effectively memory map the file, make
updates to pages occasionally, flush those pages out to storage, and
wait for the flush to complete.  It doesn't exactly memory map.  It
just reads all the pages and keeps them in an array (holding a
reference to each).
To write the pages out it effectively does ->prepare_write,
->commit_write, and then ->writepage.
I'm not sure that prepare/commit is needed, but they don't seem to be
the problem.  writepage is.
For tmpfs at least, writepage disconnects the page from the pagecache
(via move_to_swap_cache), so the page that we are holding is no longer
part of the file and, significantly, page->mapping become NULL.
This suggests that the ->writepage usage is broken.
However I tried to see what 'msync' does for real memory mapped files,
and it eventually calls ->writepage too.  So how does that work??
Any advice would be most welcome!
Thanks,
NeilBrown
