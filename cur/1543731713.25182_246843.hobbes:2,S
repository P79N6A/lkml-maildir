All reiser4 inodes have i_ops->lookup != NULL, so open(..., O_DIRECTORY) would
succeed on them (thanks Nikita for reminding me that).
It may be better to pass the control of that to ->i_op->permission() through 
explicit MAY_LOOKUP flag.  It can be possible to eliminate the race by some
more complex logic (strict ownership check, for example) in ->permission().
