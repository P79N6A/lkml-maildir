Hi,
my recent IBM SCSI drive (18GB IC35L018UWD210-0) connected
to an old Adaptec AHA-2940 UW adapter make as very 
irritating high pitched noise (as if it were parking/unparking
his heads?) periodically with the following intervals:
1min35
2min12
5min03
2min14
1min02
4min09
4min14
3min18
1min06
1min04
It runs in ext3, journalling has commit interval set to 5sec.
Does something happen in the kernel with a about 1min05 interval?
Is there some way to keep it busy?
My kernel is 2.4.7-10
Thanks for any reply to this strange request ;-)
