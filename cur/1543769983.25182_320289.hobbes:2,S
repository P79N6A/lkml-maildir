In some cases, gcc decides that a given division is too complicated to
do it in one assembler instruction. That's especially true for things
that newer CPUs support but older lack.  In these cases, gcc emits a
function call instead of the actual division and normally, libgcc would
provide these functions.
However, it's each architecture's decision to link-in libgcc or not,
because it can open another can of worms. Alternatively, you can
implement these little functions on your own and put them somewhere in
some library file.
