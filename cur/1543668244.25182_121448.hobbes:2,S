Did you compile USB HID input drivers as modules? IIRC, the keybdev
module is not named that way anymore in 2.5 kernels, so the "keybdev not
found" error is normal.
I was getting those errors on 2.5, and they were normal for me as I did
compile all the USB support built-in into the kernel, so there were no
USB modules to load. I had to edit /etc/rc.sysinit and remove a bunch of
stuff to get them away.
