And how do you figure out the date?  ;)

Not sure what drop-behind is.  Sounds interesting.
Anyway, what updatedb, userspace defragmenters etc. need is a
notification, what has changed.  Without this notification, they have
to look at everything and figure it out themselves.  Ask the network
people why select doesn't scale too well - updatedb is even worse
because it doesn't even notice that *anything* has changed, much less
what change happened.
O_DIRECT, O_STREAMING or O_WHATEVER is also a different beast.  With
streaming media, there is no way to avoid touching the data in the
first place.  If there was, we could do even better, but there isn't.
For updatedb there is.

The 90% solution is a good thing.
