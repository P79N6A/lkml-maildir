With the BUG_ON() use in linux/list.h I get this:
  CC      init/initramfs.o
In file included from include/linux/wait.h:23,
                 from include/linux/fs.h:205,
                 from init/initramfs.c:2:

                 from init/initramfs.c:2:
include/linux/kernel.h: At top level:

include/linux/list.h:164: error: previous implicit declaration of 'printk' was here
make[1]: *** [init/initramfs.o] Error 1
make: *** [init] Error 2
It looks like this is a result of having asm/bug.h included and not
having linux/kernel.h included before it, as adding that makes this go
away. This seems like it will be a problem for platforms that use
printk() in their BUG() definitions (in the HAVE_ARCH_BUG case) without
dragging in this header from somewhere else.
With this I can build on sh again. The other solution is to add the
include to asm/bug.h directly, but it would be nice to avoid linux/
includes from asm/ context in general..
Thoughts? Or ideas for a more appropriate fix?
