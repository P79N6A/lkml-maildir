atomic_t is the wrong thing as it's basically an int, not an unsigned long.
atomic64_t/atomic_long_t is also probably the wrong thing to use as it's a
signed long (and the long is also volatile on some platforms - x86_64 for
example).  Bitops operate on unsigned long.
But the most important point is that assign_bits() has to take the same pointer
type as test_bit(), set_bit(), test_and_set_bit(), etc., and none of those
operate on an atomic*_t.
We could change that, of course, but I don't fancy tackling the task just at
the moment.  It oughtn't to be a difficult change, but there are a lot of flags
words in the kernel.
