The other thing to add here is that if you're outside of the kernel,
you *don't* want to be implementing your own spinlock if for no other
reason than it's a performance disaster.  The scheduler doesn't know
that you are spinning waiting for a lock, so you will be scheduled and
burning cpu time (and energy, and heat budget) while waiting for the
the lock.  I once spent over a week on-site at a customer complaining
about Linux performance problems, and it turned out the reason why was
because they thought they were being "smart" by implementing their own
spinlock in userspace.  Bad bad bad.
So if a userspace progam ever uses volatile, it's almost certainly a
bug, one way or another.
