Hello all,
a fax-machine with cyclades-8-card (isa) 256MB, 1GB ext2, 1GB swap, 40GB
reiserfs hangs after a period of time (8-48h) with an oops.
It seems to hang on a "sync" but the messages are not the same every time.
(there was a dead "sync" process in "ps x")
the same behaviour occurs in 2.4.5 and 2.4.6.
I've tried to reproduce the crash by pushing the load up to >100 - but
nothing happens. But within 48h the machine hung again.
Do you have any hints or ideas what to do now ?
best regards
wicki
