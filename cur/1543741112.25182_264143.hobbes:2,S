I totally agree on the "beauty of Linux development" part of your statement,
I don't 100% agree on your definition of maintainer.
There a few well defined maintainer in the community and those names
are defined and written in the kernel documentation.
So, I think that is moving target but we have a few stable and well
know references.

Good point, 
even though I'm almost sure that both Linus and Andrew prefer getting
patches after they are reviewed by those "maintainers".
Anyway, 
I'm not a kernel hacker at all so my comments will sound just silly to
a lot of people involved in the development but as a user I'm
sometimes "alarmed" by the lack of formality in the development
process (see the naming wars),
Maybe we cannot avoid it, maybe that's the reason because linux is
"the best free OS" but maybe we can add a few more rules/indications
to the process.
Larry,
thank you for your answer, I always appreciate having such a kind of
open discussions with people that are really involved in the
development.
Ciao,
