	Hello,
	I've sent some mail recently to Richard Gooch about his devfs
patch, but I got no answer; the last version is from the last year, but
it was usual to have a new version at least as frequently as kernels. 
	Anybody has any news? maybe he has taken some holydays, anyway
the changes in the PCI and block device code of the post 2.3.37 kernels has
broken completely the last version (devfs-v152).
