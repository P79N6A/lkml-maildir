I think we are in agreement. To avoid confusion, I think we should be more 
precise on what fairness means. Lag (i.e., ideal fair time - actual 
service time) is the commonly used metric for fairness. The definition is 
that a scheduler is proportionally fair if for any task in any time 
interval, the task's lag is bounded by a constant (note it's in terms of 
absolute time). The knob here is this constant and can help trade off 
performance and fairness. The reason for a constant bound is that we want 
consistent fairness properties regardless of the number of tasks. For 
example, we don't want the system to be much less fair as the number of 
tasks increases. With DWRR, the lag bound is the max weight of currently 
running tasks, multiplied by sysctl_base_round_slice. So if all tasks are 
of nice 0, i.e., weight 1, and sysctl_base_round_slice equals 30 ms, then 
we are guaranteed each task is at most 30ms off of the ideal case. This is 
a useful property. Just like what you mentioned about the migration cost, 
this property allows the scheduler or user to accurately reason about the 
tradeoffs. If we want to trade fairness for performance, we can increase 
sysctl_base_round_slice to, say, 100ms; doing so we also know accurately 
the worst impact it has on fairness.

Agreed. I've seen papers on scheduler economy but not familiar enough to 
comment on it.

I simply removed the locking and changed a little bit in idle_balance(). 
The lock was trying to avoid a thread from reading or writing the global 
highest round value while another thread is writing to it. For writes, 
it's simple to ensure without locking only one write takes effect when 
multiple writes are concurrent. For the case that there's one write going 
on and multiple threads read, without locking, the only problem is that a 
reader may read a stale value and thus thinks the current highest round is 
X while it's actually X + 1. The end effect is that a thread can be at 
most two rounds behind the highest round. This changes DWRR's lag bound to 
2 * (max weight of current tasks) * sysctl_base_round_slice, which is 
still constant.

Yes, the description was based on O(1) and the intent was exactly not to 
be much a departure from its design. I totally agree the same philosophy 
should apply to an implementation based on CFS.

Without the global locking, the global synchronization here is simply 
ping-ponging a cache line once of while. This doesn't look expensive to 
me, but if it does after benchmarking, adjusting sysctl_base_round_slice 
can reduce the ping-pong frequency. There might also be a smart 
implementation that can alleviate this problem.
I don't understand why quantizing CPU time is a bad thing. Could you 
educate me on this?
I guess it's worth mentioning that although we now have nanosecond-level 
accounting, scheduling in the common case still occurs at timer tick 
granularity.
