This one is designed to test a few things rather than move the world on
a great bound. If you just need the 3c509 fix its in the patch at the
bottom of this to save you the hassle of getting ac5 ;)

If you have a problem in 2.2.2ac5 verify you can duplicate it with 2.2.2
before posting general bug reports if possible. Make sure it is obvious
if a bug report is about -ac5 to avoid any confusion.
Definitely let me know if you have any ac5 specific problems. Don't bother
Linus unless 2.2.2 unpatched also breaks.
