Subject: [PATCH] Add ability to unoptimize module compiles and dwarf2 asm
This patch adds in the ability to unoptimize a single kernel module to
make source stepping more linear and not optimize out variables that
the developer might like to inspect.  It used with adding
COPTIMIZE=-O0 to the build line.
Also when creating a debug kernel add in dwarf2 sections for the
assembled code.  This makes source stepping the assembly files
possible as well as having references into the .S files in the back
trace information.  The -gdwarf2 was chosen to work around any
problems with the stabs assembly sections.
