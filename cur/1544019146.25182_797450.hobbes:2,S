Hm, OK.  What's the reason we need to move cpu 0's percpu area?  Its 
always seemed a bit awkward.
Once it has been moved, how can I find the address of a variable in the 
original boot-time cpu 0 percpu area?  There's a couple of pages which 
Xen will have marked RO which need to be made RW if they're being freed 
back into the kernel pool.  Currently I use per_cpu_var(gdt_page), but 
guess that's a small offset rather than a directly usable address.
Thanks,
