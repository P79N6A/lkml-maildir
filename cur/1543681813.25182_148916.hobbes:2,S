GNU parted has had the GPT code for a couple years now, and
CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION has been in both 2.4.x and 2.5.x trees for over a
year.  To the best of my knowledge and experience, it works equally well
on x86 as on IA-64, modulo booting with traditional BIOSs of course.
# parted /dev/sdb print
# parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt
# parted /dev/sdb mkpartfs p ext2 0.017 some-really-big-number
partx in util-linux can even tell the kernel about it without requiring
a reboot.
I'd definitely be interested to know of cases where it doesn't work, so
I can get them addressed.
Thanks,
Matt
