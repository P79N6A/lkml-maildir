autoconfig() is _not_ called from serial8250_isa_init_ports().
The problem is that the console write method may be called prior to
autoconfig() being run for the port in question, so tx_loadsz may be
uninitialised.

Only if you ignore the fact that tx_loadsz may not be initialised.
The only things which the console code can rely on being initialised
is the port address description (iobase / membase / iotype / regshift),
the flow control (UPF_CONS_FLOW) in flags, and in the case of Xscale
systems, the capabilities.  Everything else will be in an indeterminent
state as far as the serial console code is concerned, and therefore can
not be relied upon.
