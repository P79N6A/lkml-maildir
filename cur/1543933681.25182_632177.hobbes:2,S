.. but that's perfectly fine. A PCI-E bridge will certainly retry it in 
hardware (or it isn't a PCI-E bridge!).
The CRS bit in question is purely the *software*visible* bit - ie whether 
the OS gets told about the delay or not. As long as the OS then just 
retries the same device, enabling CRS SV is pointless.
So I'm going to disable that thing. If there is some _other_ PCI-E bridge 
that is simply buggy, and cannot handle the hw retry itself or is just 
otherwise dodgy, we can have a white-list for cases where it really needs 
to be done, but the current code is just bogus.
