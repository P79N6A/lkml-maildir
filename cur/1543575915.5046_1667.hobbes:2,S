Somewhat.  I guess there are at least two ways to do it.  First flush the
buffers where ordering matters (log blocks), then send the others onto the
dirty list (general metadata).  You might have your own end_io for those, and
sync_buffers would lose it.
Second way (reiserfs recently changed to this method) is to do all the
flushing yourself, and remove the need for an end_io call back.

Yes, this is exactly what we've discussed.
