I've just packaged up the latest hotplug scripts into a release, and
they can be found at:
	
http://download.sourceforge.net/linux-hotplug/hotplug-2001_02_28.tar.gz
	
http://download.sourceforge.net/linux-hotplug/hotplug-2001_02_28-1.noarch.rpm
	
http://download.sourceforge.net/linux-hotplug/hotplug-2001_02_28-1.src.rpm
depending on which format you prefer.
The package fixes some problems that kept the last release from working
properly on RedHat 6.x based machines.  There is also a bit of RedHat
init script assumptions in the package, due to the support of patches
from RedHat engineers :)
If people have problems with other distro bases, please let us know on
the linux-hotplug-devel mailing list.
Changes in this version from the last release are:
        - added keyspan to the list of modules to be unloaded
        - more network interface special cases: lo, plip
        - cleanup, enable '#' comment lines (Gioele Barabuci)
        - add 'usbcore' and comments to usb.handmap for hub device class
        - cope with bash1 vs bash2 issue ("unset IFS")
        - add /etc/hotplug/blacklist
        - update README
	- added patch from Trond Glomsrød to make the scripts able to
	  handle i18n properly.  Might not work so well on older
	  initscript packages, especially non-redhat based systems.
	  Tweaked the patch to handle different locations of the
	  'functions' script.
	- added patch from Trond Glomsrød to keep the ppp, ippp, and
	  isdn network interfaces from being called in the network
	  script.
	- added patch from Adam Richter that removes dependency on /tmp
	  being writable.
