Hi,
I noted that even try_to_free_buffers locks lru_list_lock.
Then it tries to lock some others - maybe one of the other treads
got one of those (hash_table_lock, free_list[index].lock)
It fits with that proc 4 it executes in the beginning of
try_to_free_buffers, does it move?
Or is it stuck at a spin lock there - which one? disassembly of
try_to_free_buffers?
