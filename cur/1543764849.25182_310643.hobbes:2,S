No, have a look at the macros:
#define NLMSG_LENGTH(len) ((len)+NLMSG_ALIGN(sizeof(struct nlmsghdr)))
#define NLMSG_SPACE(len) NLMSG_ALIGN(NLMSG_LENGTH(len))
NLMSG_LENGTH points to the end of the payload in the message, NLMSG_SPACE
represents the total size aligned properly for a possible next multipart
message.
It is unlikely that nlmsghdr will ever be unaligned but there can be no
reason to introduce code that can break with perfectly legal changes just
because of that.
