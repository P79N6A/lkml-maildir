If you took a look at that floppy writer patch, it was _very_
clever. It basically took machine down to real mode and then done I/O
using bios. I think that floppy-oopser patch is safe (as long as ROM
is ROM :-).
Anything what stores block numbers relies on our i/o drivers to
work. Going through bios looks much more reliable.
