Greetings,
(CC: requested as I am not on lk at home, just work)
In brief:
Running 2.2.1[46], I am unable to mount a vfat partition.  The partition is
3.5GB, and starts 8GB into the disk.  Win9[58] recognize it, and I used
each to format it.  Linux however, does not appear to recognize it as a
valid filesystem.  The values it is reading from the superblock look like
garbage.  I used cfdisk under Linux to do the partitioning.
Before I dive into the fs code, does this problem sound familar to anyone? 
Also, any pointers as to where best to begin would be appreciated.  
TIA,
Eli
