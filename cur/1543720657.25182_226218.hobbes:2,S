Tar uses inode numbers to determine which files are hardlinked. So if you
tar up a tree containing 0-byte files, then untar it somewhere, all 0-byte
files will end up being hardlinked to each other. The same happens when you
use cp -a.

Or take a hybrid approach: use your scheme for directories and my scheme for
files; use bit 0 or bit 31 to indicate what scheme is used. Then directories
have unique inode numbers, and files too as long as their directory records
are in the first 64Gb of the disc.
