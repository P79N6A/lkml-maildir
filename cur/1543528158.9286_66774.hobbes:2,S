What you have sent is what I used as a first draft for the implementation.
The good part of it is that it reduces code duplication. The _really_ bad
part is that it penalizes users in terms of numbers of shared memory 
segments, max size of /dev/zero mappings, and limitations imposed by
shm_ctlmax/shm_ctlall/shm_ctlmni etc. I do not think taking up a 
shmid for each /dev/zero mapping is a good idea ...
Furthermore, I did not want to change behavior of information returned
by ipc* and various procfs commands, as well as swapout behavior, thus
the creation of the zmap_list. I decided a few lines of special case
checking in a handful of places was a much better option.
If the current /dev/zero stuff hampers any plans you have with shm code 
(eg page cachification), I would be willing to talk about it ...
