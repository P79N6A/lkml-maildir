Problem is that jschmoe can take a hex editor to any file she wants, and
make it "ALL CAPS" and then SUID it, or just wait for somebody capable to
run it. Even if she hasn't got the "set capability" cap. That's why
capabilities can not reside in the executable file itself. But if they are
in the filesystem, you need specialized tools that can recover/set them.
F.ex. tar(1), so you can create backups that preserve them, etc. Or you
forget about the dearly beloved Unix way of doing things, and get a
different set of tools...
Also note that the capability to write to raw disk is in essence equivalent
to the current root power in both schemes.
