Great, will you have patches for the existing e1000 drivers soon to use
it?  Or will they be a while before they can be available?
As it is, the one posted user of this api is for a driver that has been
rejected, so as there are no users of the api, I feel it should be
deferrred until there is a user to make sure it all works and feels
proper.
thanks,
