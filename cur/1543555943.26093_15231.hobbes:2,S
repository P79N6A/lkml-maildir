I just login and then try to play mp3 file from the mounted NTFS partition
using mpg123 program. I'm calling it directly from bash. It immediately
reports the bug and it's 100% reproducible. I understand that this is due to
unimplemented part of the driver. Will it be implemented someday? Because
I don't use the NTFS partition too often it isn't of too much importance to
me but it would be nice to be able to read it (if I don't convert it to
ext2fs sooner ;-)).
