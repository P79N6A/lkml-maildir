Jeff et al who might prefer a kernel debugger,
One should note that when a person or critter is backed into a corner
and pressured hard enough that he makes an "over my dead body"
level statement more pressure is likely to solidify the position rather
than change it. In the case of a critter it is tied up with survival. With a
person it is often tied up with "face". At this point Linus has been led
to making a very strong negative comment about kernel debuggers.
He is pretty much in a position now that "demands" he not change that
opinion lest he appear to be a weak leader. We were all foolish to
back him into a corner.
I see an image of a penguin. He is wearing a bandana around his
forehead and cammie's for clothes. He is armed with an impressive
array of things which carve and cut and things which go bang and
boom and make holes in other things. He is glariing over the top of
a foxhole filled with even more such tools screaming, "You'll have that
kernel debugger in my main Linux build over my cold dead body!"
Now, who makes the cartoon for that one? (And if the penguin had
a superficial resemblance to Linus it'd be DELIGHTFUL!)
