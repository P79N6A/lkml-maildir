Of course not. The requirement is at the software interface level, not the
silicon on the card level.
So you can do several things. Eg you can use the mmu to block access
by another context pending I/O completion.

Ok then the matrox is a case where it can't do direct 2D render. It needs
helper code in the Xserver. It isnt the only one - try writing random bit
patterns to a Voodoo card (this btw is why the glide device driver isnt
worth a lot..)
