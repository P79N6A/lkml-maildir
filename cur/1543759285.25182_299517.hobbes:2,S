Ok, but this morning I noticed another potential problem, one that 
I've pinged Jack K., (the author of the pcHDTV-1.6 driver kit, some 
of whose modules overwrite kernel modules by the same names,) about 
just a few minutes ago.
I'm getting the usual nvidia generated 'tainted kernel' messages in my 
log when the modules are loaded:
Mar  4 04:17:46 coyote kernel: bttv: no version for "struct_module" 
found: kernel tainted.
Mar  4 04:17:46 coyote kernel: bttv: No versions for exported symbols. 
Tainting kernel.
Mar  4 04:17:46 coyote kernel: bttv: driver version 0.9.15 loaded
Mar  4 04:17:46 coyote kernel: bttv: using 8 buffers with 2080k (520 
pages) each for capture
Since we do have the srcs for this one, how can a relative dummy like 
me fix this?  Or should I wait for Jack K.'s answer...  Grepping 
kernel srcs for a 'struct_module' seems to come up empty for 2.6.11.
