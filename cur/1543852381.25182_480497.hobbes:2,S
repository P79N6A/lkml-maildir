It appears in both i386 and x86-64 that the check is only on the first MCFG
entry and it only checks a hard-coded value of 16 buses.  This check is only
done if pci access type == 1.  The patches I posted yesterday have a few more
checks and warnings concerning the MCFG region, but these checks are only for
the resource allocation.  They do not concern actual config access. With those
patches applied we should be at least able to track more buggy BIOS's provided
that people notice messages in their dmesg.
