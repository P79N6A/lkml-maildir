No you cannot call it until all data has been copied. 
copy_{to,from}_user fails when a fault happens during the copy process. 
So you simply cannot try again... It will fault again.
Well, not 100% true. An other running thread (same mm with the process 
which copies data) can "fix" the faulty adress space. Bad thread....
