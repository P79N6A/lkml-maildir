If Linux is to fulfil its potential and become the OS of choice for 
home, office and server applications, we need to conduct ourselves in a 
gown up manner and be, well, nice.
If I have an idea, but put it forward in the wrong forum, I would expect 
to be politely redirected. "What the f**k has this to do with the 
kernel? Go away" is not nice and will see the unlucky recipient 
scuttling back to Windows.
If I present my work for peer review, I would invite and respect any 
politely given criticism or advice. "What is this strange *crap*? This 
will only get into the kernel over my dead body" is not the way to 
secure ongoing efforts and enthusiasm.
And remember that people posting here for maybe the first time are not 
aware of what has gone before, the unspoken rules and conventions.
And now I am guilty of being arrogant, and off topic.
