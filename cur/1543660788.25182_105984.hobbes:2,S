Quite independent of this discussion, my boss came across this today
while looking at some strace output:
   gettimeofday({1043689947, 402580}, NULL) = 0
   select(4, [0], [], [], {1, 999658})     = 0 (Timeout)
   gettimeofday({1043689949, 401857}, NULL) = 0
   gettimeofday({1043689949, 401939}, NULL) = 0
   select(4, [0], [], [], {0, 299})        = 0 (Timeout)
   gettimeofday({1043689949, 403577}, NULL) = 0
Note that 1043689949.401857 - 1043689947.402580 = 1.999277.
The Single Unix Specification (v2 and v3), says of select():
   Implementations may also place limitations on the granularity of
   timeout intervals. If the requested timeout interval requires a finer
   granularity than the implementation supports, the actual timeout
   interval shall be rounded up to the next supported value.
That seems to indicate that a fix is required.
