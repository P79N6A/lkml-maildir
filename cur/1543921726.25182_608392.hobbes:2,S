usb_hcd_flush_endpoint() has a retry loop that starts with a spin_lock_irq(),
but only gives up the spinlock, not the irq_disable before jumping to the
rescan label.
Split the spin_lock_irq into the retryable part and the local_irq_disable()
that is only done once as a micro-optimization and slight cleanup.

One more such example that was not found by lockdep. I guess this counts
as a false positive, as it is clearly harmless, but working around
it is a small optimization for the case where local_irq_disable()
is a hypervisor call.
Should we try to fix this class of (non-)problem in other places?
Will this patch cause a different warning with lockdep since now we
are pairing spin_lock() with spin_unlock_irq()?
