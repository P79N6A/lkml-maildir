thanks!

ok, indeed testing of that is in order now.
I'll check what the worst-case runtime stack footprint is for an 
allyesconfig 64-bit bootup - that should be the worst-case scenario on 
x86. We have a low number of leftover places, but the serious ones like 
the IPI paths, which triggered stack overflows in the past, got all fixed.
The test is underway with:
 CONFIG_64BIT=y
 CONFIG_NR_CPUS=4096
 CONFIG_MAXSMP=y
