okay, but this would mean that the nmi_watchdog is
enabled if I do not specify nmi_watchdog at the kernel
boot/command line ... or how should I interpret the
steadily increasing NMI counts in this case?
don't get me wrong, I'm happy if nmi_watchdog is
enabled by default, but I would like to know/verify
that ...

no nmi_watchdog and nmi_watchdog=2, both result in
increasing NMI counts, nmi_watchdog=1, only in LOC
counts ...
# cat /proc/interrupts 
           CPU0       CPU1       
NMI:      75378      74923 
LOC:     159900     159896 
ERR:          0
