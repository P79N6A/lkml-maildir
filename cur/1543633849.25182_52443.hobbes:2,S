That might be the right solution - leave "pci_enable_dev()" as-is, and
just consider that the legacy way of "enable stuff that got allocated
automatically".
And make new drivers start using "pci_request_irq()" and friends.
(The current "pci_enable_dev()" is broken in many respects: sometimes you
do NOT want to enable the IRQ until you have set up the device, but in
order to set up the device you may need to know _which_ irq it will have,
and you need to enable access to memory and IO regions and map the
device).
