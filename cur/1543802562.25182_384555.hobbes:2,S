I can't follow the logic here and I certainly don't see much difference 
in practice.

Yes, that's true.  I must admit that I wouldn't have expected the 
increased overhead to be very big.  In general, the "system" CPU time in 
a kernbench is only about 1% of the total CPU time and the extra 
overhead should be just a fraction of that.
It's possible that better distribution of niceness across CPU leads to 
more preemption within a run queue (i.e. if there all the same priority 
they won't preempt each other much) leading to more context switches. 
But you wouldn't expect that to show up in kernbench as the tasks are 
all the same niceness and usually end up with the same dynamic priority.
