Hello.
I posted a message to netdev@vger.kernel.org,
linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org and netfilter-devel@vger.kernel.org
11 hours ago, but it seems to me my message has not delivered yet.
Usually it won't take 10 minutes to be delivered.
So, I'm thinking my messages was dropped.
Does vger.kernel.org have spam filter and automatically drop spams?
Regards.
