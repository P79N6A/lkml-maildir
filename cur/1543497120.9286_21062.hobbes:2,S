I am having unfortunate experiences with Linux.
It seems that Netscape can cause it to lock up so tightly that I need to
hit the power switch to get it back.  This is NOT good.
It seems that the OS should be able to detect a rogue application
and take some corrective action -- just letting me log in on a different
terminal to kill the offending process would be sufficient.
Of course, there is the possibility that my configuration is incorrect...
Can someone help out?
Ted
