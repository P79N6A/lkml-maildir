Actually, even RHL 8.0 and Mdk 9.0 binutils are too old, there
were important TLS bugfixes since then.
So either you need latest H.J. Lu's test release:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/binutils/test/binutils-2.13.90.0.6.tar.bz2
or my binutils rpms which have these patches backported:
ftp://people.redhat.com/jakub/binutils/2.13.90.0.4-1/
