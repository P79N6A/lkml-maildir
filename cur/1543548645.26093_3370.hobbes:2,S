Sigh... You know, some stuff is security-sensitive. Dunno about other
folks, but in such situations I prefer to send the patches OOB to
relevant maintainers. And they often go through several rewrites before
they go into the tree. Having descriptions of _all_ pending patches in
publicly accessible place may become an interesting problem.
