Interesting. I didn't notice this search dialog before because its menu item 
was placed in the "File" menu, which is the wrong place for a find command 
(Which should be in an "Edit" or "Search" menu). I believe others have missed 
it as well. Also, it is possible it wasn't available when I wrote the 
preliminary version of the patch back in March.
Aside from that my search dialog has some advantages:
1. Full text search - if you search for "available" in File->Search you won't 
find anything. Searching for it in Edit->Find will find many things. I think 
File->Search only searches using the identifiers or at most also the title.
2. Regular expression search.
3. Displaying the results in a tree, with their context.
All that said, I don't mind merging my modifications into the existing code, 
or replacing it entirely.
