Hi,
Please tell me how to install a patch on linux kernel. I have downloaded a
patch "kernel-patch-2_2_13-kdb_0_6-2.deb". How to install this patch? I am
using a 2.2.14-12 kernel. Can I install the above patch. 
The main idea of mine is to install kdb to debug the kernel. Please help
me out with this.
Thanks in advance,
sathish.j
