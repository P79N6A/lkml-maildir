It doesn't necessarily have to be a flag on a driver, just an example.
I was more interested in a transitional interface to wean current
modules/code off of any BKL expectations during an ioctl.
Why should the kernel take out the BKL for the module during an ioctl?  Does
the kernel know how long this request might take?

No.  Flags on drivers are never a good idea.  What's more, if somebody
wants that shit parallelized they can always drop BKL upon entry and
reacquire on exit from their ->ioctl().
