So you've somehow managed to trick most kernel developers into
granting you power over not only the BK history, in such a way that
anyone willing to extract all the information available from the BK
repository and share it with others is forbidden from doing so by the
license?

I'd much rather you didn't ``give´´ it at all, then people wouldn't be
locked into it, and the community might have come up with something as
efficient earlier with the extra push.  Now we're faced with choices
such as keeping on with a presumably technically-good but non-Free
software, or switching to a Free and hopefully as-good software and
losing history.  Clever trick, indeed!

Is it even legal to attempt to stop someone from sharing information
that is not owned by you?  Or did you get to own all of the metadata
in the repository?

I don't think so.  What he's doing is more along the lines of `hey,
this allegedly-GPLed driver contains a piece of binary firmware whose
source code is not there, could we either replace it with actual GPLed
code or remove the driver?
