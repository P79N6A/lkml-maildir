I have a device (the device in question is the infamous cuecat) which
connects between the computer and a PS/2 device, and I'm trying to
figure out a good way to chain serio devices, such as:
	atkbd <-> cuecat <-> lowlevel driver
The serio driver, however, is very clearly not designed for such
chaining.  So, the question is:
What do you folks think the best method for chaining the
serio drivers is?
