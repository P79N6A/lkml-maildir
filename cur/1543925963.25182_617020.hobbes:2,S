From: Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jeremy@goop.org>
patch ace2e92e193126711cb3a83a3752b2c5b8396950 in mainline.
XFS leaves stray mappings around when it vmaps memory to make it
virtually contigious.  This upsets Xen if one of those pages is being
recycled into a pagetable, since it finds an extra writable mapping of
the page.
This patch solves the problem in a brute force way, by making XFS
always eagerly unmap its mappings.
[ Stable: This works around a bug in 2.6.23.  We may come up with a
better solution for mainline, but this seems like a low-impact fix for
the stable kernel. ]
