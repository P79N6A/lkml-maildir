It runs in a loop here, just like the $subject says, and bko#12153 says.

Sure, I can try to find out why the limiter does does not work here.

No, my proposal would prevent the kernel to call any modprobe for the
special built-in device 5:1, it shortens the recursion to zero, which
sounds like the right fix. It's really weird to fix the symptoms,
instead of the real problem.
The kernel forks a binary with a broken environment. Even the
in-kernel-tree cpio generator creates /dev/console, and accessing it
from a kernel forked binary makes it crash. The kernel must provide a
sane environment for stuff that it calls, I think, that is pretty
obvious.
Device 5:1 is a core device, which never makes sense to call modprobe
for it. No other later driver will ever register that dev_t, so we
should do it before calling out to other random userspace stuff which
triggers the kernel to go crazy with its own devices.
My proposal was to connect 5:1 to the kobject map at the same time as
we register the whole tty class. We allocate the class, create sysfs
entries, run /sbin/modprobe at that time, why shouldn't we just
register the dev_t that time too?
It properly prevents the needless userspace "driver searching" for a
well known, already created, but not properly registered core device.
It makes the process environment sane, and prevents the root cause of
the bug, and does not just limit the damage.
Thanks,
Kay
