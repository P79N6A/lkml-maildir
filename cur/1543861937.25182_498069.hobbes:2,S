If the rate doesn't slow (if only artificially), people are discouraged 
from reviewing, because it becomes a moving target.

Request an account on 
http://www.foo-projects.org/
 which supports git. 
The Intel guys use it to send me e1000/ixgb changes, for example.

The only thing exported to -mm is the code changes, as a patch.  git 
merely automates the process, so that Andrew doesn't have to spend time 
[that he doesn't have] tracking a project with a high rate of change.

Probably because it was a moving target with a high rate of change, 
requiring time that Andrew did not have just to keep in sync and fix 
build conflicts with other -mm patches.
