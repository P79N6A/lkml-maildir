Agreed.

Ok.  So somehow we have done the insane thing of putting .bss in the middle of
the executable.  It might even be sane if it is just the .init sections we put
after it, but no we are putting .data after the .bss.
Well that easily explains why we had a problem.
Getting the proper accounting in for handling this case is probably reasonable.
It probably also makes sense for someone to take a good hard look at the crazy
ordering of sections on x86_64.
