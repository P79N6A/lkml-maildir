   I'll be trying in a few hours.
Meanwhile for people wanting the crashes to be fixed, please
apply this patch.
This was _always_ broken, and really what netfilter is doing
should have never worked.  The only theory I have right now
is that people using netfilter never had IP fragments timeout.
:-)
So the patch below restores previous behavior exactly.
Ie. netfilter sources fragments cannot send ICMP errors
on frag queue timeout :-)
(The line numbers may be off a bit, but "patch" should still
 eat it).
