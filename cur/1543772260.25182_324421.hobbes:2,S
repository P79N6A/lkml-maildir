Only reason I can see for hpet_tick to be zero is when there was some error 
in hpet_init(), and we start using PIT. But, later we try to fallback to an 
uninitilized HPET. 
Can you look at your dmesg before the hang and check what timer is getting used?
The dmesg line will look something like this...
time.c: Using ______ MHz ___ timer.
