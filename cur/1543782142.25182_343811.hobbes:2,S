FWIW, all filesystems using the generic page cache routines are able
to return this - see mm/filemap.c -> generic_file_buffered_write...
	page = __grab_cache_page(mapping,index,&cached_page,&lru_pvec);
	if (!page) {
		status = -ENOMEM;
		break;
	}
which is a similar condition to the one under which the XFS code is
returning this error.  Let me know what the verdict is and I'll get
the XFS side of this merged if its really necessary.
cheers.
