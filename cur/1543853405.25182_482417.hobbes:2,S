Hmm. Maybe. I'd be happier with a global "we can do MSI" flag, and making 
it easier for people to enable it (rather than do this one driver at a 
time). And yes, _if_ it's true that MSI works on all Intel SB/NB 
combinations, then maybe we could enable it for those systems.
In the meantime, I'm really tired of continually hearing about MSI 
problems, when there really aren't that many advantages.

I don't think "nice" is enough of an advantage to overcome "doesn't work 
on God knows how many systems".
