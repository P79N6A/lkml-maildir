   I will try to get sysctls to turn off delayed ack and a reasonable
   way to increase initial cwnd into 2.2/2.3 (reasonable for cwnd
   should at least include a recompile, because otherwise it is too
   easy for users to cause too much harm)
If you wish to make initial cwnd a sysctl or similar (and this might
be perfectly fine), please do two things before sending me a patch:
1) Make sure the RFCs do not explicitly forbid such a tunable.
2) If the RFCs specify lower and upper "acceptable" bounds, make
   sure the sysctl hook enforces this.
Later,
