I haven't looked at this particular slow-work implementation.  Do you
refer to some internal refcounting or to some refcounting as a service
for the API user?
IME, scheduling work and executing work is often accompanied by
reference counting of this sort:
static int schedule_delayed_work_wrapper(struct foo *container,
					 unsigned long delay)
{
	int scheduled;
	foo_get(container);
	scheduled = schedule_delayed_work(&container->work, delay);
	if (!scheduled)
		foo_put(container);
	return scheduled;
}
static void foo_work(struct work_struct *work)
{
	struct foo *container =
			container_of(work, struct foo, work.work);
	do_the_work;
	foo_put(container);
}
But I think that whenever there are additional call sites of
foo_put(container), this refcounting of container_of(work, ...) cannot
be easily generalized.
