Floppy is compiled as a module.
The system is a dual p5 233mmx 128mb ram (4x 16mb 4x32 EDO and 2x 32mb 8x32
EDO, 8 simm slots total).  MOBO is a tyan s1564d tomcat iv.  Expansion cards
are: Matrox Millennium PCI, 4mb /w 4mb upgrade.  3com 3c905b.  3com 3c509. 
No other cards installed.
This machine locks up if I'm in X and try to access the floppy.  The light
comes on, and the machine freezes at that point.  SYSRQ doesn't work.  It
will ONLY lockup if in X (graphics mode causing it?)  Matrox chip is mga
2064w if that makes a difference.  I compiled 2.2.13pre15 for this machine. 
Same problem.
I'm not sure what the floppy drive is.  I have another machine in the same
room with the same expansion cards, but has more cards installed.  Both
machines use 2.2.10.  The other machine has 8x 32mb 8x32 simms installed
(256mb), no ide hard drives.  Has 2 adaptec aha2940U cards, 8 scsi hard
drives, 2 teac cdroms, a yamaha 4x6x cdrecorder and a tape drive.  This
machine does not lockup.  Basically the machine that locks up is a stripped
down version of the one that doesn't.
This week (on the machine that doesn't lockup with the floppy) I formatted
~120 floppies (don't even ask!) while using X w/o problems.
Does anyone have any ideas on this?
I'll give complete hardware configs and kernel configs if you need them.
