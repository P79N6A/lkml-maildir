I don't understand what you mean. Even if a device is suspended, be it
automatically after some amount of inactivity or as directed explicitly by
a user, we want to be able to open the device and have it work.
Conversely, we only want to automatically suspend the device, or allow the
device to be explicitly put to sleep, if the device is not being used.
For the majority of devices, that seems like a basic, simple, intuitive
rule. I'm sure there will be exceptions (there always are), but I expect
those to be rare and subsystem (if not platform) specific.

I agree.
