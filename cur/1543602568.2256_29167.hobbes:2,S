The Linux Test Project ltp-20010925 was released today. You can download
the
Linux Test Project on SourceForge at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ltp.
* Over 400+ tests have been added that extend the kernel system call
  coverage of the LTP.
* Each added test is enhanced with options such as looping, functional
  coverage, and error tracking for testing reliability and robustness.
* Test case structure has been reorganized based on testing area,
  i.e. system calls, network, io,   etc.
* Descriptions of EVERY test are now located under /doc, as well as
  under each test category subdirectory.
* Updated INSTALL and README documentation to reflect new
  LTP structure.
Test results on the 2.4.9 kernel have also been posted.
