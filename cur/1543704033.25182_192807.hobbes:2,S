A couple of comments:
* You might want to take a look at Hugang's patch to support laptop mode 
on reiserfs in 2.6. This patch was posted somewhere last month. It adds 
a "commit=" option to reiserfs, so that you can change this externally 
by remounting. I think this solution is a lot cleaner than to have 
reiserfs code directly depend on laptop mode.
* If you decide to port that patch, you might want to look at the 
documentation for laptop mode in 2.6. The control script that's in there 
works for both 2.4 and 2.6, and it automatically remounts your ext3 and 
reiserfs filesystems with the appropriate commit options (and remounts 
them without the commit options when laptop mode is stopped). (There is 
also some ACPI event binding code in the documentation, which 
automatically enables laptop_mode when using battery power and disables 
it when your laptop is plugged in. I don't know if that works with 2.4 
though.)
