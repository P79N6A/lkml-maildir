Lookin gat the code, your _new_ code just throws samples away _entirely_ 
just because some random event hasn't happened (the first thing I noticed 
was the context switch testing, there may be others there that I just 
didn't react to).
In short, you seem to cut those random events to _zero_. And this happens 
under what seems to be perfectly realistic loads. That's not trying to fix 
things, that's just breaking them.

No, it appears to be a nuisanse even for people who have real issues, ie 
just generating _occasional_ numbers on machines that just don't happen to 
run much user space programs.
