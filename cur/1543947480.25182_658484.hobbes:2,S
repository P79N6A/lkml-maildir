This patchset is another sequel to my patchset to fix iommu segment
boundary problems, IOMMUs allocate memory areas without considering a
low level driver's segment boundary limits:

This patchset fixes the Alpha IOMMU code.
There are four patches in this patchset. The first two patches are
preparation for the third patch, which fixes the IOMMU segment
boundary problem. The fourth patch just a cleanup, which removes an
unused code.
This is against 2.6.25-rc2-mm1.
