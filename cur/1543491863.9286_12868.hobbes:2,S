I tried 4.51 on 2.2.5-ac[12] and kept getting bus errors when clicking
on some articles on slashdot and linuxtoday. I'm on Xfree86-3.3.3.1,
lesstif-0.88.0 and jdk_1.1.7-v1a, now I'm back on 4.08 without problems.
One thing I'd forgotten to do was an strace.
	I can't say I liked the jumbled up news and mail either.
