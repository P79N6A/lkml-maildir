Maybe the tuner works, but the msp3400 module (which does the sound)
does'nt?

Loading the msp3400 module before bttv does'nt work with the new
bttv.  That's a initialization order problem, don't know yet how
to fix it.  Just load bttv without loading the msp3400 module first
should work (bttv autoloads msp3400 then).  rmmod and reinsert bttv
should fix it too.
