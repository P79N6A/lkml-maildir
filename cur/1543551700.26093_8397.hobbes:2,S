Hi all, 
after walking through some of NIC drivers and trying to remove check_region() 
calls, i have two small questions: 
1) many NIC drivers contain (in XXX_probe1 functions) check like this:
	if (dev == NULL) {
    		dev = init_etherdev();
	}
but many drivers don't check (dev == NULL) at all. So first question: is this check
and init_etherdev() call really required or this is old crap waiting for removal ?
2) if init_etherdev() is required, than call to unregister_netdevice() is
required too (in case of probe failure), isn't it ?
Best regards,
	    Andrey
	    
P.S. IMHO my English is especially bad today, so I'm sorry :)
