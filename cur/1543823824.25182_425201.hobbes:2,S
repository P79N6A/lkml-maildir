Ok so far, looks fine.
But what the heck is this:

I don't understand the #ifdef at all.
Why isn't that just a 
	if (unlikely(sector != (sector_t)sector))
and that's it? What does this have to do with CONFIG_LBD or BITS_PER_LONG, 
or anything at all?
If the sector number fits in a sector_t, we're all good.
