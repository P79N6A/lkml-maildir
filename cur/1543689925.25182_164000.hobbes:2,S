   It will depend on arch CPU only in case if you have unlimited i$ size.
   Servers with 8MB of cache - yes it is faster.
   Celeron with 128k of cache - +4bytes == higher probability of i$ miss 
== lower performance.

   e.g. C-- project: something like C, where you can operate with 
registers just like another variables. Under DOS was producing .com 
files witout any overhead: program with only 'int main() { return 0; }' 
was optimized to one byte 'ret' ;-) But sure it was not complete C 
implementation.
   Sure I would prefere to have nasm used for kernel asm parts - but 
obviously gas already became standard.
P.S. Add having good macroprocessor for assembler is a must: CPP is 
terribly stupid by design. I beleive gas has no preprocessor comparable 
to masm's one? I bet they are using C's cpp. This is degradation: macros 
is the major feature of any translator I was working with. They can save 
you a lot of time and make code much more cleaner/readable/mantainable. 
CPP is just too dumb for asm...
Good old times, when people were responsible to _every_ byte of their 
programmes... Yeh... Memory/programmers are cheap nowadays...
