i believe we should 'ignore' SMP spinlock starvation for now: it will be
fixed in a natural way with the most-spinlocks-are-mutexes solution,
with that approach all preemption wishes of other CPUs are properly
expressed in terms of need_resched().
alternatively the 'release the lock every 128 iterations and do a
cpu_relax()' hack could be used - but i think that doesnt solve the SMP
issues in a sufficiant way.
