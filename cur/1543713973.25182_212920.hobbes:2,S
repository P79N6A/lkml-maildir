hi, i have taken the scheduler patches (sched-*) that was included in
2.6.5-mm1 and applied to 2.6.5 vanilla, and then i applied v30b, and
fixed the problems.
so this is a patch adding v30b scheduling policies for vanilla 2.6.5
kernel. in case anyone wants it. i plan to update this patch every time
a new vanilla kernel appears.
