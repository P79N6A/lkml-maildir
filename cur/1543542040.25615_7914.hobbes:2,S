I agree with you that we should not try to share code at any price.
However, we have seen many many times that someone copies a driver,
changes a couple of lines of code such as the device detection code
and possibly the register access macros and adds him/her-self as the
author and voila we have a `new' driver.
This type of programming is bad since bug fixes to the original driver
rarely propagate to the new one. A bit of extra work to generalize the
register access macros often pays off very well in the long run.
