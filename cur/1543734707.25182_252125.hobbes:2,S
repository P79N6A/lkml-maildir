Handy tool, thanks.

Running 2.6.9-rc1-mm5 ATM.
This code returns, hdd is a new 200GB WD:
[root@coyote src]# ./cache-flush-test /dev/hdd
issuing FLUSH_CACHE: worked
issuing FLUSH_CACHE_EXT: worked
And hda is an older 120GB Maxtor
[root@coyote src]# ./cache-flush-test /dev/hda
issuing FLUSH_CACHE: worked
issuing FLUSH_CACHE_EXT: failed 0x51/0x4!
Is this the real cause of my aborted journal on / 3 or 4 days ago?  I 
was running -rc1-mm2 at the time.
