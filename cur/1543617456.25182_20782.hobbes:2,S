Hi folks!!
    On to the massive fbdev cleanup. The second patch requires the first
patch. The first patch is the currcon one that I posted earlier. Every
driver makes use of the currcon field in struct fb_info.  The second patch
makes every driver start to use fbgen. The first function that is mass
reproduced in every driver do_install_cmap is removed to one spot. I like
people to test this before it is sent off to Dave Jones. The patches are
big so here is the link to them:

Have fun. I have tested on my local machine. Works like a charm.
