Hi Andrea,
In my opinion, 2 agents that write to the same location (current_state)
without any synchronisation can only mess up any kind of ordering that
applies to the view of all agents observing a single agent. 
Btw, the lock after the double write from thread 2:
		"movl $0,%0\n\t"
		"movl $0,%1\n\t"
-->		"lock; addl $0,(%%esp)\n\t" /* flush our write buffers*/
does not fix at all the disordering problem, IMO.
In my opinion, the only situation that could make sense is to lock for
the both writes to 'current_state'. 
By the way, I never liked the sequence that consists in changing the 
current->state and relying on some barrier to avoid race.
In my opinion, the only way to be obviously correct is to have the
whole sequence that tests the condition and that move the task to its wait
state actually protected.
Something that the following make sense to me:
  LOCK(some_lock)
  if (CONDITION is FALSE) then SLEEP(some_event, &some_lock)
And have SLEEP that first puts the TASK into some sleeping state on 
'some_event' and _then_ unlock 'some_lock'.
(Some other well known constructs that use 'assert_wait' and friends also 
make sense to me).
Sorry if I missed something, but the issue is perhaps so complex that my 
brain also races. :-)
Gérard.
