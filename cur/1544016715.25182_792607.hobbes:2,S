Sure - it would be commonly used as well. Perhaps we dont need 
percpu_xor() at all? (or and and ops already give a complete algebra)

hm, that removes much of its appeal - a preempt off+on sequence is quite 
bloaty. Most percpu usage sites are already within critical sections.
I think they are more analogous to per_cpu(var, cpu), which does not 
disable preemption either. There's no 'get/put' in them, which signals 
that they dont auto-disable preemption.
