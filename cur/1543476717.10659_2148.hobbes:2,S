Arcavm15 looks very good.  pre5 and arcavm13 look a bit better but of the
kernels with the anti-deadlock code it looks the best so far. ( I assume that
being based upon pre6 it's safe.)
The battery in my palmtop died so I don't have the page fault and swaps results
available for arcavm15.  I'll grab the pre-7.gz patch and see how it does.
