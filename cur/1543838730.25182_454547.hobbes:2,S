Play successful on skyrocketing stoock markets
Fellow Invvestor, big news are hitting on thursday for AG AO!!!
Somebody knows something...place AGA O on the radar!!!
Get ready for a volatile 2nd half of 2006 - one where the Bulls and 
Bears will BOTH be proved wrong. But odds are, we'll see another 
year where the mraket indexes bounce around a lot without really going anywhere. And we'll also see certain sectors - favored at this point in the economic cycle - SOAR... 
Own the right stockss, in the right space, and you could reap a 
handful of money-doublers. But if you own the wrong investment, you could easly lose 25%-35% or more! 
Here is my Favorite Pick for the second half of 2006: AGA O!!!

Laughter is the closest distance between two people A crowd is not company. . Keep your friends close but your enemies closer Vice nah hurt but conscience ah hurt yuh. There is always some madness in love But there is also always some reason in madness .
Quality is an excuse for lack of quantity .
