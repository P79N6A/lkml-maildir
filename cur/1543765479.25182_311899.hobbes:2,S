The VIA IRQ fixup in 2.6.11 is broken.  It works for some, but
not all boxes with VIA hardware.
There's a fix in 2.6.12-rc2-mm3.  Actually, I doubt that it will
help you, though -- the 2.6.11 breakage is such that some machines
that need the fixup don't get it (and don't print the "VIA IRQ
fixup message").
