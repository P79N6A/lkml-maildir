  No, but not every user "can write an application" either, or even
  have the skills to apply patches. What I was talking about wasn't
  just tar, which itself isn't the best example anyway, but the idea
  that users can load plugins that will extend the functionality of
  their filesystems. That idea seem to be to be _much_ better than
  trying to teach every user how to write applications or patch
  existing ones.

  No, but if I wanted to have an encryption plugin active for some of
  my files or directories then why should I not be able to? I still
  want to edit, view and save my encrypted files.
  Again, this was just an example of what could be done with plugins.
  It is not said that every conceivable plugin will be written, nor
  loaded per default. Even though plugins cannot today be dynamically
  used, they will be eventually. Reiser4 is still very young.
  Please separate your thoughts for specific plugins from those of the
  idea to have plugins at all.
