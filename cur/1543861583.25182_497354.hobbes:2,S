The whole discussion started out from the premise, that some
filesystems can't support stable unique inode numbers, i.e. they don't
conform to POSIX.
Filesystems which do conform to POSIX have _no need_ for samefile().
Ones that don't conform, can chose a scheme that is best suited to
applications need, balancing uniqueness and stability in various ways.

And with 64bit st_ino, they'll have to live with the limitation of not
more than 2^64 files.  Tough luck ;)
