Ok, I suspect the phasing out of check_region(...) is responsible
here.  In test10 and older, check_region() wasn't done if an explicit
i/o address was supplied - this was to accomodate the now rarely used
reserve= bootprompt which dates back to before modules existed.
Since ne.c doesn't allow modular autoprobing, there was always an i/o
address present, and hence you could still load the module even if
there was a potential i/o space conflict.
In test11 and newer, check_region() is gone and an unconditional
request_region() takes place, which will not allow any i/o space
conflict.  In your case, 0x360 is suspect since a ne2000 is 0x20
wide in i/o space and you are probably bumping into either:
0376-0376 : ide1
0378-037a : parport0
Check your /proc/ioports, and relocate your ne card as appropriate.
Paul.
