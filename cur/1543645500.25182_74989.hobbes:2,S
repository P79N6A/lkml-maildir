Thanks for the test. NUMA is on my TODO list, after figuring out 
where/how to drain cpu caches and the free list.
I've found one stupid bug with debugging enabled: the new debug code 
tries to poison NULL pointers, with limited success :-(
And one limitation might be important for arch specific code: 
kmem_cache_create() during mem_init() is not possible anymore.
