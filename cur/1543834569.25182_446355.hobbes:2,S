We have a solution, subject to some bit rot I'm sure.
The cookie/cursor hack should have been rejected.
I'm still wondering why that ever got accepted.
Hugh had a patch set containing a tree-based replacement
for the PID handling. It worked perfectly, letting /proc
look up the lowest-not-under PID for any given PID.
(can anybody find the patch set?)
BTW, here's a WONTFIX resolved bug that places the date
for the patch set as being prior to 2005-05-21.

In state X perhaps?

Well, we have to pin something if we don't use a tree.
If I remember right the cookie/cursor thing was mostly intended
to solve real-time problems. Obviously it fails at this too.
(not that attackable hashes are acceptable for real-time!)

With the right kind of tree, you just look up by PID and get
back the nearest result which is not less than the desired one.
This is what the older patch set did.
I like trees. They have nice cache properties. Decent trees are
immune to being turned into linked lists via hash function attacks.
The non-crypto hashes in the kernel ought to worry people.
