We have such a need -- we just always paper over it with 
spin_lock_irqsave() or local_irq_save() because those are "the rules." 
grep around :)
See ata_pio_sector() in libata-core.c, where we do:

This is a core non-DMA data transfer routine.  Given the high cost of 
disabling interrupts during the relatively-slow PIO data transfer, we 
added extra logic to only disable interrupts for the highmem case.
The code in libata-scsi generally only deals with a single buffer, on 
average less than 128 bytes in length.  So the memcpy() isn't really 
that expensive in the case being discussed -- unlike the 
ata_pio_sector() case, where the cost is very, very high.
Aside: The "FIXME: use bounce buffer" comment above indicates the more 
optimal PIO data xfer approach of
	local_irq_save()
	kmap_atomic()
	memcpy into bounce buffer
	kunmap_atomic()
	local_irq_restore()
	/* do slow PIO bitbanging data transfer */
	ap->ops->data_xfer(...)
