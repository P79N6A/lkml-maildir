'lspci' claims that this is:
"07.0  Acer Laboratories Inc. [ALi] M1533 PCI to ISA Bridge [Aladdin IV]"

Probably.

No, no technicolor or other sounds effects.  The whole thing just
locks up with a power switch as the only option.

My box is much healtier than that.  Regardless if I booted into a file
system on a SCSI drive or on an IDE drive (I happen to have those
options although I prefer IDE - I have there something which I can loose
without any real pain :-) I can still fsck drives healthy after the
crash but I did NOT risk fsck under 2.4.1.  Things looks way too screwy
for this.

Possibly, but I crashed the whole thing without mounting anything from
IDE drives at all.  There are still there but unused.  I simply managed
to get something in logs for the case described.  Note that errors
I quoted are from a device 08:05, i.e. SCSI driver (/dev/sda5 to be
more precise).  When my compiler went bonkers and started to read
clearly some random stuff instead of sources then the whole action was
happening on a SCSI drive.
