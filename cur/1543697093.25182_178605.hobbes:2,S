another couple of data points:
i've pulled changesets 1.1148.17.2, 1.1120.11.16, 1.1120.11.15, and
1.1063.2.72 off of 2.4.23-pre9, and i am no longer able to reproduce the
crashes on one of my SysKonnect-attached systems (haven't tried the other
one yet).
this system is running fedora core 1.  the 2.4.22-blah kernel that
comes with fedora is using v6.15 of the sk98lin driver without
difficulties, btw.
