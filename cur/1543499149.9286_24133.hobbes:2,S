Most of the other Unices implement the getcontext(2) and setcontext(2)
functions, as a portable (!!) means of performing a context switch from
a userland app (such as a green threads package).  Solaris, Tru64
(Digital) Unix, DG/UX, Irix, and HP/UX all support these two functions.
How difficult would it be to implement these under Linux?
Yes, I realize inline asm is faster, but much less portable.
Thanks,
	Jeff
