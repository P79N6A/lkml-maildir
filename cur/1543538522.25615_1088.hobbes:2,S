Depends on the type of bug and how easy it is to backport.
If it's a "data can be corrupted" bug, then it would be nice to backport, if
feasible.
If it's a "temporary slow down" bug, or "unecessary work" (eg unnecessary
bus reset that doesn't otherwise damage the system) then it's not necessary
to backport.
Work on the stable kernels _should_ be extremely limited.  Only critical
bug fixes should be applied.
