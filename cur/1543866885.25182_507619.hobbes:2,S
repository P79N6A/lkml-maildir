Well, it couldn't actually be an empty routine (at least not for a PCI 
device), since the generic PCI suspend/resume handling doesn't get 
called if you have suspend/resume functions defined, so you'd have to do 
the pci_save_state, pci_disable_device, pci_set_power_state, etc. in 
there at least. Using empty functions would prevent those from being 
called and result in your PCI config space contain crap after resuming, 
which can break the whole system.
That's a bit messy, actually.. I know we can't just do that stuff 
unconditionally in the PCI layer since some devices blow up if you 
disable them, which we normally do, etc. We should just have some 
generic function you can stick in the .suspend slot that just says "I 
know how to suspend, but don't need anything more than the generic 
handling". And if you do need more than that (which is almost always the 
case), you can just call that from your own function and then add what 
you need, instead of duplicating the code a million times (sometimes in 
an incomplete/incorrect fashion) like we do now.

That is one good excuse for not implementing it - the driver is part of 
a framework which does not handle suspend/resume itself. (The current 
FireWire stack is another case like this.) This is the kind of situation 
where I would say the driver should just define a suspend function that 
returns -ENOSYS and then the user would know they have to remove that 
module, etc. before suspending (there is at least some distro script 
support for doing that automatically based on a config file), since it 
hasn't a hope of working after resume until the framework is updated to 
support suspending.
