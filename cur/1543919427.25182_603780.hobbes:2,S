I agree I am lucky, but the fact is that the in-kernel driver supports
*some* devices, and *works* correctly for them. On the other side, your
driver supports more devices, but it is and *out-of-tree* driver.
Please either work to get your change merged, or stop complaining about
changes done to the in-kernel driver.
Moreover if you get a closer look at v4l-dvb git, you will see that the
changes proposed by Mauro are not em28xx specific, and is actually the
same change done on a lot of of v4l/dvb drivers.
