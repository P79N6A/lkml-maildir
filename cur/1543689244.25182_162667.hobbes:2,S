Hi  there..
I want to change UDP communication to unix-like..
that is linux send UDP packet as 4, 3, 2, 1 but i want to send it as 1 2 3 4
the attached file is icmp.c, ip_output.c and upd.c having GENIE_IP_PATCH
but if i apply this patched then it occures BAD CHECKSUM..but the sending sequence is sent which i want to.
I don't know why BAD CHECKSUM is occurred.
anyone give me some advice?? 
Thanks...[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
