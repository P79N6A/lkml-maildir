Does this mean cpu-am33v3, cpu-am33v4, etc. will be created
when a new core comes up?
Isn't it possible to split codes by features, instead of target cores?
If the AM33v2 is the base architecture and a new core feature comes up
on AM33v3,
that core feature should be enabled by a new CONFIG_* or a dynamic switch.
Generally, drastic changes won't come up
as long as the new CPU core is on the same architecture.
Whole directory separation would be inappropriate for the CPU cores on
the same arch.
If similar codes were in multiple files and directories, it would be
hard to maintain them.

Ditto. Splitting by features would be better.

This should be conditioned by a feature.
Isn't it a feature or a limitation that several non-FPU instructions are
necessary just after the EPSW_FE is set?

Are these specific to MN103E010, or applicable to some other LSIs?
If they are not specific to MN103E010, the file names aren't good.

Stranger names here.
