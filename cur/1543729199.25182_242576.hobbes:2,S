Subject: [PATCH] change scsi_ioctl to allow cd-recording 2.6.8.1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
this is my first Email to the kernel-mailing list. I hope i have understand 
the howto-post-a-patch the right way. 
As burning cd's as user is not possible with 2.6.8.1 without setting cdrecord 
setuid root and burning with k3b wont work at all, i decided to change 
driver/block/scsi_ioctl.c to allow it again. I allowed the commands listended 
in MMC-2 paper. Burning cds with k3b works now fine again, burning dvds 
should also work again. 
regards
Andreas
