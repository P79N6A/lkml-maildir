Actually, I expect it's in scsi_sleep(), in scsi_error.c.
I get c0199e95. and according to /proc/ksyms: c0199e24 scsi_sleep_R35962bf8
(close enough). scsi_sleep() calls "add_timer(&timer)".
I can reproduce this by inserting a cdrom, and issuing a mount command
before the drive is ready. Plain 2.2.1 does NOT have this problem;
there, the attempt is retried after a couple of seconds, and then
succeeds. On 2.2.1-ac6, the mount process hangs in state 'D', and can
only be fixed by rebooting.
FYI: Buslogic 958 with Plextor PX-12CS on Tyan Titan III with Winchip 240
(CentaurHauls C6-2 according to /proc/cpuinfo).
