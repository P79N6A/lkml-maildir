Sorry, I should have been more precise.  I was thinking of Ext2 and I
was refering to this field:
	struct ext2_inode {
		...
		__u32	i_blocks;	/* Blocks count */
		....
	};
Curiously, this field is measured in 512 byte units, giving a 2TB Ext2
filesize limit.  That's starting to look uncomfortably small - I can
easily imagine a single database file wanting to be bigger than that. 
One way to fix this would be to add a superblock flag indicating that
this field is to be interpreted in units of filesystem blocks.
