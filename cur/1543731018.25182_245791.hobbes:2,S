Hmmm, I just straced  "cp /bin/bash /tmp".
One line stood out as a potential problem:
open("/tmp/bash", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_LARGEFILE, 0100755) = 4
What do we do with O_CREAT ?
Do we always allow both a directory and a file to be created with
the same name ?
Does this create a new class of "symlink attack" style security
holes ?
