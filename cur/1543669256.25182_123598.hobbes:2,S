All,
I'm trying to get pcnet32 working on a board.  The driver appears to 
work without problems on x86, but on my noncoherent board, I have a 
number of issues.  I still need to narrow them down a bit, but I was 
wondering if anyone here had tried to use this driver on a noncoherent arch?
TIA,
Eli
