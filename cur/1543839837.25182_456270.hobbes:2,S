We link against the commoncap facility introduced by Bert Hubert, to
provide 'standard' capabilities support; we simply add another check at
capable() time to _also_ check the capability against the list allowed
in the current profile.

Seems like a great idea for e.g. binding to low ports, chroot, and
changing users for e.g. password changing. The other 24-26 capabilities
may be less useful. :) Still, I agree, complementary, and hopefully a
mechanism such as this proposed mechanism would help drag capabilities
out of the dark ages.
Thanks Serge
