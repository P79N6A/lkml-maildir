I don't see a problem.  A HCD device such as a keyboard is always
"active" because it must always be listening for keys as long as the
keyboard is plugged in.  You can explicitly "soft unplug" by unloading
the module; the proposal doesn't change that.  (Although it would be a
nice interface to copy the PCMCIA method, where you tell the USB
subsystem to disconnect a device instead of having to know which
module(s) to unload).
I agree that in that case, the device is active regardless of its
module reference count.  They aren't the same thing.
(Taking it further, USB keyboard is an example of a driver that could
be made permanently demand-pageable as all of the code _could_ be
executed in a process context, if USB's callbacks were made to work
that way, but that road is potentially quite a complicated and error
prone one).
A network device is similar as long as its interface is up (if it's a
device).  A protocol module is active as long as it has any active
users, for which various definitions are possible.
Protocol (+ mid-layer, helper modules etc.) show that ideally the
"active" property of a module includes any references to it by other
active modules, which can be interpreted in a simple or a complicated
way, depending on how thoroughly you want modules to be paged out
while still presenting their interfaces in /sys, /dev, /proc,
ifconfig, iptables etc.
