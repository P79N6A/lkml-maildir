Subject: [PATCH-2.4] raid5 oopses on 2nd failed device

hi!
it looks like raid5 is buggy. as 2nd device is failed, I got oops.
it's BUG at raid5.c:212. this is because sh->written[N] isn't NULL.
raid5d thread try to handle this stripe, but following condition
skip handling:
        /* might be able to return some write requests if the parity block
         * is safe, or on a failed drive
         */
        bh = sh->bh_cache[sh->pd_idx];
        if ( written &&
             ( (conf->disks[sh->pd_idx].operational && !buffer_locked(bh) && buffer_uptodate(bh))
               || (failed == 1 && failed_num == sh->pd_idx))
            ) {
I suggest to fail requests which can't be returned as successful.
with best regards
