Err, no. Please read what was written.
"With multiple disks on a chain, you can see transients that
lock up the CPU in IRQ mode for human-perceptible time,
especially on slower CPUs... "
I was pointing out that this will be a throughput rather than
latency issue. Unless you're saying that an interrupt handler
will run for 30ms or more?

That has nothing to do with what I said. I said ksoftirq doesn't
alleviate latencies.

It is relevant because code complexity is relevant. Have you
been reading what has been said? Don't take my word for it, read
what Andrew is saying.

I haven't looked at *any* part of *any* patch, nor commented on
any patch. I described the type of discussion and acceptance
that needs to happen before a large patch (like this) gets merged.
I also backed up Andrew's assertion that better interrupt latencies
wouldn't really help interactivity (the scheduler is a *far* bigger
factor here)

I don't know what you're talking about, sorry.
Why are people so touchy about this subject? I didn't even anywhere
criticize anyone's patches or any approach or idea!! :\
The best way to get anything to happen is to get a common
understanding going through constructive discussion. Please stick to
that. Thanks.
