I'd be interested to know what the C standard says about whether the
compiler can reorder writes that may be visible to a signal handler.
An interrupt handler in the kernel is logically equivalent to a signal
handler in normal C code.
Surely there are some C language lawyers on one of the lists that this
thread is going to?
