I am to understand, from a reply from Herbert Xu, that this issue has
existed a long time, definitely since before 2.6.22, therefore it
doesn't belong on the regression list.
The bug reporter says something that drives me a little batty, which
is probably what got this onto the regression list.  He says "2.6.22
(not sure)" as the most recent kernel where the problem didn't occur.
People should list no version at all if they don't know, otherwise
we'll just get more bogons on the regression list.
