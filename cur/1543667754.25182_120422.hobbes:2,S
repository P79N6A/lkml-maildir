Well, then it's not my bug then. Go to the drivers/video/console/fbcon.c,
and do (pseudopatch):
+ memset(data, 0xff, size);
  if (cursor->set & FB_CUR_SETSIZE) {
-    memset(data, 0xff, size);
     cursor->set |= FB_CUR_SETSHAPE;
  }
 
Correct cursor should appear after that. It is questionable whether this
layer should do this SETSIZE -> SETSHAPE propagation, as soft_cursor()
does same. I recommend leaving this here, and removing it from
soft_cursor() code.
