Two identical kernel configs, one with one without CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3334684  152208  138624 3625516  37522c vmlinux
3340352  152464  138752 3631568  3769d0 vmlinux
So that's 5668, 256 bytes data and 128 bytes of bss for a total of 6052
bytes.  Not a whole lot but I still fear some users on the most
claustrophobic systems will mind.
