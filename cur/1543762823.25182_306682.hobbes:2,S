Subject: [PATCH 0/9] isofs: unobfuscate rock.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch removes macro obfuscation from fs/isofs/rock.c and cleans it up
a bit to make it more readable and maintainable. There are no functional
changes, only cleanups. I have only tested this lightly but it passes
mount and read on small Rock Ridge enabled ISO image.
