Hmm, that means I will have to keep the short names, since I can't very
much have two different ABIs across several kernel versions... or I will
have to backport whatever is needed to expand this name size restriction
(and who knows if that's doable... I better start digging).
This won't be easy on my side :(
Well, might as well claim tpacpi as a thinkpad-acpi short handle and use it
on workqueue and kthread naming (and document it) as well as the led class.
Yuck.

I screwed up the prefix on the first one (used LED instead of leds). The
patches are the same.  I wrote the reason for the resend after the first
"---" separator.
Anyway, thanks for the fast reply.
