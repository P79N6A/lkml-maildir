That's not right: If you look closely, you will see that the ISDN code from
the CVS  archive (or the  snapshots at ftp.suse.com) simply  overwrites the
kernel code. So you  will loose all the work that has been  done to get the
ISDN stuff running  on non-Intel platforms, especially the  onboard ISDN of
certain SparcStations.
I have pointed that out weeks ago on de.alt.comm.isdn4linux, which is gated
to the ISDN4Linux mailing list with absolutely no reaction at all.
It seems to me  that ISDN4Linux and the Kernel have  drifted apart and will
stay so.  I am not sure what to do about this.  My guess is that somebody
in close contact both with the ISDN developers and Linus needs to take
a week off and get the act together.
While we  are at it: Anybody  working on adding RFC1570  callback to Linux?
Right now  we can  do "Q.something" callback  (by D-channel  signaling) and
CBCP. But  many companies  run CISCO's for  their secure  communication (as
mine does) and they won't work  with this. I browsed the ISDN4Linux archive
and all i found was "Nobody needs this anyway" which is not true.
I would take  a shot at it, but  my understanding of the ISDN  code is very
limited and i would hate to duplicate somebodies work already in progress.
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
