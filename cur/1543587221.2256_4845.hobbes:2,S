So supposing 1/2 us per update
	lock process list
		for every process update pgd
	unlock process list
is ok if #processes <  200, but can cause some unspecified system failure
due to a dependency on the 100us limit otherwise?
And on a slower machine or with some heavy I/O possibilities ....
We have a tiny little kernel to worry about inRTLinux and it's quite 
hard for us to keep track of all possible delays in such cases. How's this
going to work for Linux?
