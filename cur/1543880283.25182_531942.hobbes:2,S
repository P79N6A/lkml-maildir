I thought that with releasing a socket, which will have a callback
attached only results in a leak of the callback? In that case we can
just free it in dump() just like it is done in no-error path already.
Or do I miss something additional?

Doesn't it called from ->sk_data_ready() which is synchronous with
respect to sendmsg, not sure about conntrack though, but it looks so?
