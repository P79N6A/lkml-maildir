My opinion on this matter differ, I want to:
* finish rewriting IDE code
* deprecate crap
* (later) drop crap and merge rest with libata
I will write precised TODO (w/ status) soon.
IMO this is much better solution as:
* you go from working code into small steps (evolution)
* you don't have to maintain both libata and IDE driver
   for X years (deleting drivers/ide anytime soon is a pipedream)
* as IDE becomes less popular testing gets harder
  (especially when developing new code - you don't
   have previous state)
* it shouldn't be that hard - I have many parts of the stuff
  done (they need some polishing)
Bjorn, thanks for working on this, IDE_ARCH_OBSOLETE_INIT
( -> ide_init_hwif_ports() ) needs to be fixed in order to make REAL
improvements.
