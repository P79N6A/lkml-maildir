Let me get it straight - you had just merged an alpha-quality code into
the tree.  It has a chance to get debugged, but right now we have a _big_
change turning a lot of allocations into dynamic, yodda, yodda.  And it's
one big step - not split into gradual massage of code.  And you expect
that there will be no leaks/dangling pointers aside of that one?
