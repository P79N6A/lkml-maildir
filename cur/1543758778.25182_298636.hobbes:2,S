Yup. As I wrote already. We need a new callback in pci_driver, that's
the cleanest way. It would take an "event" argument plus some still to
be defined flags to inform the driver about platform capabilities.
The driver based on the result code can then request a slot reset  if
the platform supports it, or just try to recover, or just giveup.
Another callback would come once the slot has been reset & reconfigure,
etc...
I'm going to write something down real soon now (after I had breakfast
hopefully :)
Ben.
