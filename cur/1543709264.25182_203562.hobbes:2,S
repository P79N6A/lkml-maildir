I think your ext3 numbers are off, most likely you didn't include JBD.

A lot of this is actually optional features the other FS don't have,
like support for separate realtime volumes and compat code for old 
revisions, journaled quotas etc. I think you could
relatively easily do a "mini xfs" that would be a lot smaller. 
But on today's machines it's not really an issue anymore.
