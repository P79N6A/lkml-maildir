The code currently checks if the underlying media is write-protected.
If it is, it fails the mount; if not, it does the replay (so that
mounting a root fs readonly works correctly).
I will be adding support for virtual replay for root filesystems to
act as a last-chance way of recovering if you really cannot write to
the root, but journaling filesystems really do expect to be able to
write to the media so I am not sure whether it makes sense to support
this on non-root filesystems too.

Correct.

In what way?  A root fs readonly mount is usually designed to prevent
the filesystem from being stomped on during the initial boot so that
fsck can run without the filesystem being volatile.  That's the only
reason for the readonly mount: to allow recovery before we enable
writes.  With ext3, that recovery is done in the kernel, so doing that
recovery during mount makes perfect sense even if the user is mounting
root readonly.
Cheers,
 Stephen
