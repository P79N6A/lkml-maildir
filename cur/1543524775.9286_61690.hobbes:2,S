Subject: EXT2-fs corrupt after vanilla install

Hello,
Seeking help on reproducible root file system corruption on a
vanilla Slackware 2.2.13 with PIII/500, 512MB, 37GB IDE UDMA IBM
on a Supermicro P6SBA motherboard. Atapi CD-ROM and hard disk 
are on the same controller. 
After many reinstalls and tests I come think that the file system 
is already broken  before actual use - just no idea what I did wrong.
The system passes Doug Ledfords "badblocks" stress tests ok and
runs fine for a month including kernel compiles and other sanity
checks - until the first reboot with fsck.
Will appreciate any hint on what to do.
Oskar
