501(c)3 is still pending, unfortunately.
We actually get a lot of offer for volunteers, but we can't use them
because we lack the kind of management structure needed to run them.  As
a result, we can only take on people willing to spend a sizable chunk of
time doing kernel.org stuff, *and* are already known by the rest of the
admin team to be self-starters.
However, even that is really difficult enough.  kernel.org definitely
takes a lot more of my time than I would like.
