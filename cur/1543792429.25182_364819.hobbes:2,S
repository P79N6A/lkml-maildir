Nope, it looks like there's some sort of layering/nesting going on:
% cat /sys/class/input/event1/device/description
i8042 Kbd Port
% cat /sys/class/input/event2/device/description
i8042 Aux Port
% cat /sys/class/input/event3/device/description
Synaptics pass-through
.. and the Synaptics driver wants to talk to /dev/input/event2, and
_not_ /dev/input/event3.  But the Debian scripts seem to think that
the only thing of value to expose is the /dev/input/event3, the very
top of the stack.  /dev/input/event1, and /dev/input/event2 are both
not showing up on my system once a I boot a post-2.6.14 kernel.

Great....  I'll file a bug report to Debian, and hopefully they can
get this mess straightened out before 2.6.15 (and hopefully before
2.6.14-rc1) ships.
