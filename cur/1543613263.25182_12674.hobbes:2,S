On the other hand, the 2.4 and 2.5 Configure.help files have not forked yet,
and the overhead of fixing this problem is low.
Here's what I've done.  First, I have applied your patch.  Next, I added
the following line near the bottom of Configure.help.
# compile-command: "egrep -n '^  .{71,}[^ ]+' Configure.help /dev/null"
Now I can do compile-command in my Emacs and step through the wide entries,
correcting them where possible.  Sometimes it's not; there are some *long* URLs 
in the file.  
I'll clean this up before each Configure.help release.
We're now down to 29 missing entries, by the way; I got three almost immediately
on posting the request, and congratualations to the IA64 port group who are now
completely clean.  Here is the revised list:
