Linux had patches many years ago (in 2.3.x), but it was never merged
because it is inherently unscalable on MP. Classical BSD sockets really 
don't work well for zero copy - you need a new interface (like POSIX aio) 
that allows the kernel/user to tell each other when use of data is
finished and buffers can be reused.
