Because I do not like modules [when kernel changes more often then its
version changes, it is hard to keep right versions of modules with
right versions of kernel -- /var/lib/modules/_version_ is now not
enough. And when I hack my kernel, I do not increase version
counts. That's why I do not trust modules.]
Because I want to be able to nfsroot= with pcmcia ne2k.
