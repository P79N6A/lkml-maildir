what performance issues does this raise in the cast of a directory
with _many_ files in it -- when we are renaming often involving that
directory?
I ask this because certain MTAs do just that; and when you have
10,000 to 100,000 messages queued I immagine you might spend much of
your time waiting for ->i_sem locks?
    Truncating is a piece of cake. Repacking is not a good idea,
    though, since you are risking massive corruption in case of dirty
    shutdown in the wrong moment.
ext2 directories seem somewhat susepctable to corruption on badly
timed shutdowns anyhow; and I don't think there is any way to do
atomic writes to them with most disk hardware is there?
