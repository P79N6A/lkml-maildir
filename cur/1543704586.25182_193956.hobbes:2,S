It seems a little bit different from my situation: 2.6.2-rcX (basically non 
-mm versions) boots and works just fine (besides some oopses on shutdown, but 
this is another story, I'll investigate further on this).
-mm series, both 2.6.2-rcX-mmY and 2.6.1-mmZ with Z > 3 hangs after 
decompressing image, if I leave -funit-at-time in Makefile. I can  redo any 
of these tests, I can also use a serial interface to capture any "hidden" 
oops, if someone sends me any needed patch to show some data (i.e. early 
printk) and the desired tests.

The same holds for me :)
