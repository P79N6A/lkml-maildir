Also depends on GENERIC_HARDIRQS, right?  (You should let
the Kconfig UI handle indentation, too...)
Seems like doing this for an I2C chip ought to shake loose
some interesting review comments.  :)

This somewhat resembles the pcf857x chips in that it only support
pin-changed IRQs (IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH) in hardware.  Some other I/O
expanders are a bit more flexible.
