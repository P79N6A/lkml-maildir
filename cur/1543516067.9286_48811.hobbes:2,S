Subject: Building on 2.3[.28] not maxing out CPU utilization

Kernel builds used to max out at 97-98% CPU utilization on 2.2.
Sometime during 2.3, it dropped down to 88-91%.
It now takes about 7% longer to build the same source
on 2.3[.28] than it does on 2.2[.12].
My UP system has 64 MB so it doesn't swap on kernel builds.
Just in case... I'm using scsi driver AIC7XXX.
To reproduce, try the following:
        make clean
        sync
        time make bzImage
