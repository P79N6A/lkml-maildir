Hi,
I put a simple construct in kernel/sched.c like this:
struct runq_log_s {
        char comm[16];
        int  pid;
} runq_log[1024*1024];
and the kernel didn't boot. Yes, I understand it is 20M of bss - so what?
I will try with a smaller value and see what is the limit but am curious
as to the reason. The last thing I see is Uncompressing linux... Maybe the
code in arch/i386/kernel/head.S which clears BSS is broken at "large
values"?
Regards,
Tigran
