Not every mouse controller lets this sequence thru ?
(e.g. laptops with simultaneous stick +ps2 mouse)
A mouse not emitting this sequence would be broken.
However you could easily recover by polling the mouse
status every second. A newly-plugged mouse will have
characteristic bit pattern.

See above for a perfect solution.

See 
http://home.t-online.de/home/gunther.mayer/gm_psauxprint-0.01.c
for a _dirty_ hack collecting info from various sources. This is the first
linux tool to implement the PS2-PNP protocol (for identifying MS mice).
