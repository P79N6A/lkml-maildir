The problem is not that it wouldn't work.
The question is whether users compiling their kernel should know 
anything about USB_LIBUSUAL.
IMHO, USB_LIBUSUAL is an internal implementation detail and there's no 
reason why a user should ever see this option.
This is what my patch does.
The next question (not attacked by my patch) is whether we really want 
two code paths in the two USB storage drivers, or whether they should 
simply always use libusual.

The only compile errors I know about are
  USB=y, USB_STORAGE=m, USB_LIBUSUAL=y
  BLK_DEV_UB=y/m, USB=y/m, USB_STORAGE=n, USB_LIBUSUAL=y
but this issue is easily solvable (it's the drivers/usb/Makefile part 
of my patch).
