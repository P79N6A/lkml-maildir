Well, it'll allocate memory from the node containing the CPU that the process 
is running on, so if you've pinned your process (e.g. with schedutils) you'll 
be ok unless you're short on memory.  If it's not pinned, you'll run the risk 
of having your process refer to memory on a remote node.  Depending on what 
type of system you're running on, this could be a very small performance 
issue or a large one.

The kernel, by default, will allocate memory on the node where the process is 
running, and fall back to other nodes based on distance.  That said, it's not 
a bad idea to pin your process to a CPU and use libnuma to explicitly set 
it's memory affinity.
