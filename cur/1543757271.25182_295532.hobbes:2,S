To be very clear.  I do not believe is necessary for x86.  The
is already sufficient information elsewhere to handle this.

To be clear there are two pieces of information that are needed.
1) The list of physical memory areas and what they are.
   /proc/iomem does a good job of this.
2) The list of which memory areas the kernel is using.
   It is the pgdat_t and related structures that define this.
   For the purposes of a core dump we want to capture this
   information before the kernel crashes and use it afterward.

My role in this is that of maintainer and architect.  On a practical
level I gain nothing from a working crash-dump/kexec-on-panic
implementation except it stops being a gating factor for the rest
of the kexec code.  So while many times I can see what needs to be
done it is hard for me to justify doing it.  So a lot of times
where I will weigh in with code is when I see a particular blind spot
on the part of the implementors.
The parties I see actively working on the crash dump implementation
are currently a group from IBM and you guys from valinux.co.jp.
One of the primaries at IBM has been on vacation which is likely
why we have not seen anything out of them for the last couple of
weeks.
But also this is open source software it will be done when it
is done.
