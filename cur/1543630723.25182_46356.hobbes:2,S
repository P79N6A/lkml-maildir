Helpful but insufficient. What is to stop getting into a situation where
_all_ memory that is pageable is only pageable via network? Even if you
have a big box, if you do large streaming writes to about 20 NBD devices,
you'll discover that each device queue can hold many megabytes of dirty
data.. Try pulling out your ethernet cable for a moment and watch the
thing strangle itself.
Harder to get into this situation with NFS, but still doable.
