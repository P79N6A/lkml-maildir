What I'd like to see - in whatever exact form - is the IDE equivalent to  
/proc/scsi/scsi. (And in fact, the SCSI version could use addition of at  
least the disk size and the sdX mapping.)
It's rather useful for getting a quick overview of what's on a system, and  
where.
Incidentally, is there a compelling reason why block device boot messages  
are all different?

/proc/bus/ide or something like that? Sure, why not? Exact place is pretty  
much irrelevant except to legacy code.
