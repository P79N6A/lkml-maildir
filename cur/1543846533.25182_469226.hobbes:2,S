Thanks Keith for the response.
My explanation earlier is not clear. The "automount" process dying with
restrictive overcommit settings is not because of the OOM kill. It looks
like some bug with "automount" binary itself causing it to exit when it
could not service a new request.
"cd /remote/something" when the system is out of (allocate'able) memory
causes the below events (obtained from /var/log/messages)
Oct  3 13:35:32 gentoo036 automount[2060]: handle_packet_missing: fork:
Cannot allocate memory
Oct  3 13:35:34 gentoo036 automount[2060]: can't unmount /remote
And then the automount process for /remote mount disappears, which
should not happen.
Thanks anyways, I'll try to take it up with RedHat again...
