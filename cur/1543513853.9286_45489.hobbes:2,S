The test first finds the maximum size buffer supported by
the SCSI READ BUFFER command and then times a 200 MB
transfer based on that buffer size. Yes, it is contrived.
It is not trying to measure total data throughput from
the magnetic media to the user space. It is trying to
time the SCSI bus transfer speed and adapter DMA speed
in a Linux environment. It was done to shed some light
on whether direct IO (i.e. DMAing directly into the 
user space) was worth the effort.
Back to my orginal point. The measurement demonstrated
that the SCSI bus throughput was greater than what the
Advansys driver was reporting while still being
consistent with the hardware being used.
