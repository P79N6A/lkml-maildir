I've got one of these things, model 6645, around the office and I was wondering
if anyone has any ideas how to get it loaded.  I tried booting off my RedHat
6.2 cdrom but it hangs right when it's attempting to load and execute the 
kernel.  The machine is strange in that it doesn't have a normal PS/2 or AT
keyboard connector but instead relies on a USB keyboard.  The keyboard works 
fine at the lilo prompt so I was wondering if the hanging might be caused by
the Linux keyboard driver searching for a keyboard?  Any ideas?
