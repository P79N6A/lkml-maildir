	Huh ? (checking things at vger) ... outch, a routing
	database entry error diverted all  .net  to a faulty
	address since 29th of January.  Now fixed.
	Not all (any?) of lists at vger have removed subscribers
	due to this type of bounces, but the emails thru lists
	to these recipients have been lost.
	... now who had those brown paper bags ?  :-(
