Agreed.
However, the success of it depends what he's debugging.  If its a module
which runs solely with the current processes context, then yes, it'd work.
Anything more complex, and it won't.
Since he said he's debugging a driver, its reasonable to assume that some
of it doesn't run in the current processes context, and therefore
using this method to display debug messages is likely to be fragile.
