the only argument I see is "we had overflows in 2.4 with 8k". In fact
that is part of why 4K stacks was done! With 4k/4k stacks there is MORE
stack space than in 2.4. Most of the overflows I've seen in 2.4 were
nested interrupts with complex softirqs; with the 4k/4k stack approach
interrupts have MORE stack space available than in 2.4, making overflows
less likely. In addition the 2.6 kernel has undergone a "stack diet",
the final piece of which is the IO submission change that is now in -mm.
