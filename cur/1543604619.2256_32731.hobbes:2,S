Hey everyone,
  I'm interested in trying to help with the linux
kernel development.  As a starting point, I was
thinking of trying to fix a some what annoying feature
with the make xconfig.
  It seems that if you disable support for a major
catagory (i.e. scsi, sound, etc) and you click next,
it should go to the next major catagory.  However,
xconfig currently takes you to the next sub-menu, not
to the next major menu.
  Are there any compelling reasons why xconfig should
not function this way?  If not, then I will try to
code this new logic up.
Thanks for any input,
Chris
