But userspace _can_ know the idle statistics for each CPU.  It's easily read
from /proc/stat.

Well, my "cpuspeed" daemon has been doing exactly this without problems for
the better part of a year on many laptops tested by me and others.  Polling
the CPU temperature every second or two seems quite sufficient to head off
any heat related problems (including on problematic systems like the Sony
Vaio FXA series).  It doesn't appear to necessary to poll faster on current
hardware even with severe load spikes.  (Obviously, hardware failures in
the cooling system are another matter but the CPUs internal protection
should handle that.)
My cpuspeed daemon uses a negligable amount of CPU so it doesn't seem like a
terrible solution...
(As mentioned previously, CPUs that change their own speed are a separate
issue.)
