Why does creating and then terminating a process in GNU/Linux take about 6.3
ms on a Prestonia-2.2?  I observe basically the same thing on a PIII-600.
I'm pretty sure both systems run 2.4.x kernels.  Does this suck less under
2.6.x?  Not sucking at all would mean about 100 microseconds to me.  I don't
understand why it doesn't scale with processor speed.  Does this interact
with the length of a timeslice?
It matters to me because the Common Gateway Interface spawns and destroys a
process to handle each request, and I wish it were just fast, rather than
having to use FastCGI.
A fair amount of Googling and RTFFAQ didn't answer this.
