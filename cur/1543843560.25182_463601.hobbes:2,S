They're not *entirely* subjective, though I agree some are. I find the
fact that Andrew Morton, myself, and apparently several other people 
have all instrumented the memory reclaim code to tell you *why* it's
failing to reclaim pages at various points in time slightly amusing,
but also rather depressing. It's all rather a waste of effort.
Moreover, subsystem experts know what needs to be traced in order to
give useful information, and the users may not. It's a damned sight
easier for them to say "oh, please turn on tracing for VM events
and send me the output" than custom-construct a set of probes for
that user, and send them off. There's a barrier to entry that just
won't happen there.
Hell, look at all the debug printks in the kernel for example, and
the various small add-hoc tracing facilities. If all we do is unite
those, it'll still be a step forwards.

Dynamic probes do NOT reduce maintenance, they increase it. They just
push it into somebody else's lap, where it's done more inefficiently.
That's not a solution. The question is what's add-hoc debug for a
particular problem vs. what's generically useful. I refuse to believe
that the subsystem maintainers are too stupid to be able to make that
judgement call.
