gcc 4.0 gives the following warning:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      fs/reiser4/plugin/cryptcompress.o
fs/reiser4/plugin/cryptcompress.c: In function 'grab_cluster_pages':
fs/reiser4/plugin/cryptcompress.c:1415: warning: comparisons like X<=Y<=Z do  have their mathematical meaning
...
<--  snip  -->
After a quick look, it seems gcc is correct and this assertion needs a
correction.
