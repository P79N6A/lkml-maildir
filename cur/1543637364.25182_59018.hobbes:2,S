You need to look at the full changelog to see the full entry: see, for

	[PATCH] IDE-101
	Here is a quick fix.  I would like to synchronize with the irq handler
	changes as well.  Becouse right now I know that preemption is killing
	the disk subsystem when moving data between disks using different
	request queues...  In esp.  It get's me in to do_request() with a queue
	in unplugged state.  (Not everything is my fault, after all :-).
This does still leave open the question of why these patches no longer go
to linux-kernel, though...
