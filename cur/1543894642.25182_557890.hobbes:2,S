These are not changes to the license text. These are just clarifications 
to help people understand the license. They don't change what the 
license already said.

The section 9 is meant to explain how you select one version of the 
license in a program without having to copy the entire license text to 
it, i.e., in simple programs you can just put the small text, suggested 
by FSF at the bottom of the gpl, and have the version number there, and 
that should be enough to reference the entire text.
But COPYING *is* the entire text and starts with: "
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991"
so there is no confusion about the version.

Why do you say "Wrong"? Have you contributed some code to the kernel 
thinking that the kernel was "v2 or later", only to find out later that 
it wasn't?
In case you haven't followed previous discussions, here's a pointer:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/22/176
The major kernel developers (and probably most of the total number of 
developers) are perfectly aware of the kernel license and chose GPL v2.
I'm getting pretty tired of listening to people that just _know_ what I 
should do with _my_ code. And people who treat kernel developers as 
morons who can't read a license.
We definitely need more Al Viro style comments on this thread ;)
