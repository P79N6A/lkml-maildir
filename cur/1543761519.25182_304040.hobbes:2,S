All drivers also need to cleanup driver state if they can't
simply recover (and restart pending IOs). ie they need to release
DMA resources and return suitable errors for pending requests.

To the driver writer, it's all "platform" code.
Folks who maintain PCI (and other) services differentiate between
"generic" and "arch/platform" specific. Think first like a driver
writer and then worry about if/how that can be divided between platform
generic and platform/arch specific code.
Even PCI-Express has *some* arch specific component. At a minimum each
architecture has it's own chipset and firmware to deal with
for PCI Express bus discovery and initialization. But driver writers
don't have to worry about that and they shouldn't for error
recovery either.

A port bus driver does NOT sound like a normal device driver.
If PCI Express defines a standard register set for a bridge
device (like PCI COnfig space for PCI-PCI Bridges), then I
don't see a problem with PCI-Express error handling code mucking
with those registers. Look at how PCI-PCI bridges are supported
today and which bits of code poke registers on PCI-PCI Bridges.
