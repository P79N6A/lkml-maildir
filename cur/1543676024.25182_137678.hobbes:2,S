Have you tried to build with gcc-3.3 ? I applied it on top of 2.4.x-aa,
and I just get an ICE:
End of search list.
sched.c: In function `do_schedule':
sched.c:1003: internal compiler error: in merge_assigned_reloads, at reload1.c:6134
Please submit a full bug report,
with preprocessed source if appropriate.
See <URL:
https://qa.mandrakesoft.com/>
 for instructions.
sched.c::1003 is the closing brace for do_schedule().
Any idea ?
