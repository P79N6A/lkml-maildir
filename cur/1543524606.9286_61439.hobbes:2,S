Hello
Sorry for the delay in proceeding the discussion. I am back since 3
weeks, but I did not have the time to resume this evaluation.
I mentioned that my system administrator asserted, that ping uses TCP.
But that was not true. I misunderstood him. Additionally I said, that my
ping returns only "MyLaptop is alive". That was the case, because I
translated only those ping arguments to the Solaris version, which were
used in the command line sent by Neil Brown. Thus I had tried only the
command "ping MyLaptop 8192 10". But now I can give you the correct
output (with the "-s"):
Christoph: ping -s MyLaptop 8192 10
PING MyLaptop: 8192 data bytes
8200 bytes from MyLaptop (192.168.0.1): icmp_seq=0. time=22. ms
8200 bytes from MyLaptop (192.168.0.1): icmp_seq=1. time=22. ms
8200 bytes from MyLaptop (192.168.0.1): icmp_seq=7. time=24. ms
8200 bytes from MyLaptop (192.168.0.1): icmp_seq=8. time=77. ms
----MyLaptop PING Statistics----
10 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 60% packet loss
round-trip (ms)  min/avg/max = 22/36/77
Christoph: ping -s MyLaptop 8192 10

8200 bytes from MyLaptop (192.168.0.1): icmp_seq=0. time=29. ms

8200 bytes from MyLaptop (192.168.0.1): icmp_seq=8. time=60. ms
----MyLaptop PING Statistics----

round-trip (ms)  min/avg/max = 23/54/123
Christoph:
So, there seems to be a network problem (50-60% loss).
Currently I do not have root access to the Solaris machine, thus I
cannot play around with the mount options. But I requested a temporary
root access, and I think I will get it in the next weeks. Then I will
report again.
