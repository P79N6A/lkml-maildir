Wait, we have not had a /dev/scanner since the 2.4 days.  For all of the
2.6 releases, usb scanners are controlled from userspace by xscane, not
the kernel.

Do you have CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED enabled?  If not, please read the
help entry for it and enable it.  Please let me know if this solves your

Also, what distro release are you using?
