What about this:
"If the device requires that, implement .suspend and .resume or at least
define .suspend that will always return -ENOSYS (then people will know they
have to unload the driver before the suspend).  Similarly, if you aren't sure
whether or not the device requires .suspend and .resume, define .suspend that
will always return -ENOSYS."
Greetings,
