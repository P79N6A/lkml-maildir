Subject: bitmap loading related reiserfs changes in 2.6.17-mm1 are broken
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

subj.
I've got a lot of BUG's during the boot and eventually box locked up.
SYS-RQ worked. Unfortunately none of these errors did make it to log files,
so I cannot provide the backtraces.
But reverting last 4 patches of reiserfs-changes series, namely
reiserfs-reorganize-bitmap-loading-functions.patch
reiserfs-on-demand-bitmap-loading.patch
reiserfs-on-demand-bitmap-loading-fix.patch
reiserfs-use-generic_file_open-for-open-checks.patch
fixed the problem for me.
I'm running 32 bit kernel on AMD64x2 w/ HIGHMEM,SMP,PREEMPT enabled
Hope you will find this report useful (sorry for the absence of the
backtrace though)
Please let me know if you want me to try some patches.
Thank you,
	Nick Orlov.
P.S. I'm on somewhat tough schedule during weekdays and I wont be able
to try the patches till tomorrow (Jun 24th) night.
