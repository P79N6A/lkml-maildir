Hello,
first of all, sorry for the long headline.
second:
Every time, i try to do the following:
cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature
the whole system looks up for a short period of time (something about
0.5s). realy everything, video and audio encoding, mouse and keyboard
input, firefox playing a flash animation, ...
I am also getting the following:
Losing some ticks... checking if CPU frequency changed.
maybe these two things are belonging to each other.
I am using a 2.6.12-rc3-mm1 kernel on a amd64 with a nvidia nforce4
mainboard.
kind regards
flo
