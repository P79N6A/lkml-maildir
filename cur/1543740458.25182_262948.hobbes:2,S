I reviewed, patched, and tested ppp_async.c to
implement ldisc->hangup(). This correctly terminates
the PPP connection on hangup.
Paul Mackerras already did an excellent job of
ensuring safe shutdown and I/O completion
in ldisc->close so the change is trivial:
just add the ldisc->hangup and call the
existing close routine.
One question to Alan: what is the return code
in ldisc->hangup for? The docs don't say.
