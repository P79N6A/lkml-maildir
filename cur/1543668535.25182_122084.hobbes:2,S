Yes, but the patch gives me a compile error with 2.6.67 and
I did not get any reply yet asking Adam Belay directly. My
compile error with the latest patch (I hope it is) is this:
-->
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=sound/isa/opti9xx
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=sound/isa/sb
  gcc -Wp,-MD,sound/isa/sb/.sb16.o.d -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude
-Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2
-fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=pentium3
-Iinclude/asm-i386/mach-default -fomit-frame-pointer
-nostdinc -iwithprefix include -DMODULE
-DKBUILD_BASENAME=sb16 -DKBUILD_MODNAME=snd_sb16
-c -o sound/isa/sb/sb16.o sound/isa/sb/sb16.c
sound/isa/sb/sb16.c:251: storage size of
`__mod_pnp_card_device_table' isn't known
make[3]: *** [sound/isa/sb/sb16.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [sound/isa/sb] Error 2
make[1]: *** [sound/isa] Error 2
make: *** [sound] Error 2
<--
And it was not a bazillion patches, but some of them, yes.
Any takers?
Thanks,
Alexander
