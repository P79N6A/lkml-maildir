Right.  For me:
- 2.6.9-rc3 (installed 8th Oct) died with dst cache overflow on 29th November
- 2.6.10-rc2 (booted 29th Nov) died with the same on 19th January
- 2.6.11-rc1 (booted 19th Jan) appears to have the same problem, but
  it hasn't died yet.

Running zebra (for ipv6 route advertisment on the local network only.)
Network traffic-wise, 2.6.11-rc1 has this on its public facing
interface(s) in 8.5 days.
