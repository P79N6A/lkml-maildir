	Yes.  Clean solutions which do not affect performance and *add* 
functionality should always be chosen.  KGI is such a solution.

	Anyone who wants to run more than one acceleration-using program

	X is not part of the kernel.  It should not be handling VT
switches, which it must do in order to manage the hardware like you are
proposing.  Plus this ties everyone to X.  I am still at a loss as to why
people who are normally advocates of choice in the OSS world suddenly turn
extremely conservative when the subject is accelerated graphics or X. 
People claim that KGI is forcing people to do everything "our way", but in
reality all it does it *manage* the graphics hardware, like ALSA does. 
Plug 'n play and all that.  KGI is to fbdev as ALSA is to OSS - more or
less the same thing, but one is much more intelligent than the other.  And
that intelligence is *needed* and does NOT cause bloat.

	A direct rendering layer is a good idea, but it must be an option. 
As others have pointed out, unless you have SGI-style 'smart' hardware,
the software locking/validation that will be required for direct rendering
will destroy performance.  In that situation, direct rendering is FAR
worse than having nothing at all.  KGI can easily allow for direct
rendering when the hardware supports it - mmap() the registers and get out
of the way, basically.  Zero overhead.  But KGI also supports older
hardware which must have its accelerations wrapped in ioctls or another 
form of abstraction in order to ensure stability.

	Sure, and the new which is under development KGI fully supports
XAA and friends.  We aren't stupid, of course X must be supported fully!
But there is absolutely no reason at all why X must be the *only* thing
supported.  The X people have no justification for demanding that everyone
must do things their way and only their way, when their way can be fully
supported while simultaneously allowing non-X solutions to be able to take
full andvantage of hardware acceleration.

	That is *exactly* what KGI is designed to do!!!  The number of
people on this group who are bashing KGI and quite obviously don't know
even the basics of how it is designed and how it works is very disturbing
to me.  I'm not specifically referring to you, but I have seen some real
howlers in this thread over the last couple of days.

	You say this, but you do NOT say *why* concurrency and arbitration
in the kernel is bad.  No do you state which types of concurrency and
arbitration you are referring to.  KGI goes to great lengths to provide
userspace with the mimimum set of capabilities it needs to handle these
issues in e.g. LibGGI (which is a good chunk of what LibGGI does, in
fact), and the stuff that remains in the kernel is quite minimal and does 
not impact performance unless you are using an old, braindead card in 
which case you shouldn't be expecting good performance anyway.

	That's the cheap way out.  It works, but in a very restricted 
hardware and software environment.  As you mentioned above, Linux has to 
run in a huge number of very different environments.

	Because there's no reason to!  Even if you do direct rendering, 
why does the arbitrator have to be tied to X?  The answer is that there 
is absolutely no reason, other than that some people seem to have this 
wierd, quasi-religious attachment to X in Unix environments.

	Sure, and the arbitrator doesn't have to be X either.

	Some points:
* The 'clutter' is quite minimal.
* The 'clutter' does not exist unless you use an old card.
* The 'clutter' is as fast or faster than the current system
* The 'clutter' is absolutely 100% required in order to give Linux the 
ability to multihead cleanly.
* The 'clutter' will allow everyone who wants to do accelerated graphics
on Linux to do so, with or without direct rendering or X.

	Put that functionality in a module, so that the people who want 
this functionality can have it and everyone else doesn't have to use it?  
And maybe put a couple lines of code in ALSA which would allow it to use 
the in-kernel mixer or a userspace mixer as needed?

	Why?  Doesn't this issue directly impact the kernel?
