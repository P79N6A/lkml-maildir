Subject: [PATCH] shpchp: Use dword accessors for PCI_ROM_ADDRESS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

PCI_ROM_ADDRESS is a 32 bit register and as such should be accessed
using pci_bus_{read,write}_config_dword(). A recent audit of drivers/
turned up several cases of byte- and word-sized accesses. The harmful
ones were fixed by Linus directly. This patches up one of the remaining
harmless-but-still-wrong cases caught in the dragnet.
