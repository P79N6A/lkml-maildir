When I rebooted the test box to run 2.5.42-bk2, I said Y to running
fsck, and when fsck.jfs was run on that jfs partition, I saw one message
which indicated that a problem had been found.  The message scrolled
away before I could save it.  I immediately ran dbench with 64 clients
and then dbench with 80 clients on the jfs partition, this time
successfully.  I'm now repeating the full ramp up dbench run, up to 128
clients. If nothing breaks, I'll shake it a little harder (like doing
several kernel compiles while dbench is trying to run).
Thanks,
Steven
