 Hello Linux ppl,
 In the readprofile man page load=(# of clk ticks) / (length of the procedure)
 What does "length of procedure" means. Does that mean the # of ASM lines of
 the procedure code? What is the units of the load. It cannot be %. because 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 152495 default_idle                             3176.9792 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 the above line indicate tha more than 100% of times CPU is idle. This cannot
happen.
