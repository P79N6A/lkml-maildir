I basically agree, but then when you go for a full graph everything
becomes very complex. It's not clear if that much detail is useful 
for the application.

Hmm - that could be a problem for applications that care less about
latency, but more about equal use of bandwidth (see below).
They just want their datastructures to be spread out evenly over
all the available memory controllers. I don't see how that could be
done with a single latency value; you really need some more complete
idea about the topology.
At least on Hammer the latency difference is small enough that 
caring about the overall bandwidth makes more sense.

That's the basic idea sure for normal allocations from applications
that do not care much about NUMA.
But "numa aware" applications want to do other things like: 
- put some memory area into every node (e.g. for the numa equivalent of
per CPU data in the kernel)
- "stripe" a shared memory segment over all available memory subsystems
(e.g. to use memory bandwidth fully if you know your interconnect can
take it; that's e.g. the case on the Hammer)
As I understood it this API is supposed to be the base of such an 
NUMA API for applications (just offer the information, but no way
to use it usefully yet)
More comments from the NUMA gurus please.
