Yes.  That would be a far harder problem to solve - the problem is just that 
the stdio implementation in glibc is based on GNU libio, which is pretty 
large.  For space-critical applications you might want to build a library 
containing an alternative stdio (maybe the one from newlib) and link with 
that.
