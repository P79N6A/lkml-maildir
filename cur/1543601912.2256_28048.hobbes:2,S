Well there is not an order of magnitude in it, and it then leaves SGI
in the situation of having two even more divergent versions of XFS
than we have now. I do realise there are two conflicting goals in all of
this.

Well, not everything, but the vast majority of the xfs code has not
had to change at all, we have a different buffer cache interface,
and the read/write path is different, and the inode creation/teardown
interface needed surgery to work with linux inodes, oh and endian
conversion. But apart from that ......

Working on the locking first, the tricky part is how locks interact with
the transaction mechanism.
