It's recognised in existing kernels as a RealTek 8029. Which effectively
it is.  The people at DLink wouldn't tell me any technical information.
Their downloadable pdf's are little more than product placement.
I asked if it was the same as a RealTek 8029, which got a "No".
When I asked what was different they didn't answer.
My code just reads the subsystem vendor to determine between a
genuine RTL8029 and a clone (such as the CT528).

d.
