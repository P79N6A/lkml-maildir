That particular call came from the RTC interface exposed by EFI,
which is pretty clear on things.  The only notable glitch in
translating it to Linux is that Linux splits "alarm" and "wakeup"
capabilities ... but then, EFI lets you poll that RTC and gives
effectively that same consequence:  alarm not coupled to wakeup,
at least if the system isn't asleep.

Look again, but at 2.6.21-rc2 instead ... ISTR that fix went into RC1,
but that one's been fixed in various trees (like handhelds.org) for
some time.

Look again at current kernel sources ... bugfixes have been merged
since the codebase you seem to have used as a reference.  I did an
audit of driver handling of those flags; most drivers are now fixed.

Yes, Blackfin has an unusually funky representation, but that
doesn't mean you can't do the conversion when the alarm time
comes into the driver.  It's not like the alarm is based on
offset-from-current-time, so that it'd need to be adjusted when
the current time gets updated (like some RTCs)... it's just a
strange way to encode an absolute time.

Thing is, "man 4 rtc" reports those fields as unused, which means
they can come from userspace with arbitrary values.  You should
stick to testing tm_mday, which *is* used.

You have a point there.  Someone (other than me) should come
up with a patch to handle that.
