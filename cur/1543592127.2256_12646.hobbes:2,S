SuS also states
  If a write() requests that more bytes be written than there is room
  for (for example, the ulimit or the physical end of a medium), only as
  many bytes as there is room for will be written. For example, suppose
  there is space for 20 bytes more in a file before reaching a limit. A
  write of 512 bytes will return 20. The next write of a non-zero number
  of bytes will give a failure return (except as noted below)  and the
  implementation will generate a SIGXFSZ signal for the thread.
so SIGXFSZ plus -EFBIG returned would appear to be the correct
behaviour.  That's certainly what 2.2 used to when it encountered such
limits.
Cheers,
 Stephen
