I have a question.  I've never had a riva or any other pci/agp cards except
S3 and Matrox.  If you disable setting an irq in the pci bios, would this
not fix the problem?  If the card is a AGP, I noticed that some bios's (all?
not sure, mine is set to disable vga irq) and there is a pci card
immediately below it, then it may have the same IRQ.  I worked on a 95
machine with a wide adaptec scsi.  the scsi and the video card shared the
same irq and it made 95 crawl worse than it does.  Disabling irq made the
video not work on 95.  Moving the scsi card down 1 slot fixed all the
problems.
I'd love to hear input.  I work with winblows at work and might be useful
