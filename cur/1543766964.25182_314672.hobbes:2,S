Yes, it is not needed but harmless. I did it only because i_hash &
i_sb_list insertions/deletions always come in couple. So I decided move
them both, to be more consistent, to make code less complicated.
If you regard this hazardous I might split these removals. But IMHO, my
variant is a bit more pleasant.

Thanks.
I assume I don't need to notify Andrew about the inconsistency in the
old patch, or should I?
