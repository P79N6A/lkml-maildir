I truly appreciate that. However...

I agree but I see the big delay of running the RT task to be a symptom
that the current non RT scheduler is somehow broken. I've reported the
non RT starvation condition several times. Yes, the second CPU is busy,
but I really do want to bump cpu_burn (which is non RT & nice) to run my
(non RT and not nice) stress script / commands instead.
