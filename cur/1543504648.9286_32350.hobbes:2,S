Subject: fsck and 2.3.12 oddity

There's something *very* odd going on with 2.3.12 and fsck here.
Everything works fine unless /dev/sda6 wasn't cleanly unmounted, when fsck
hangs.  It has to be sda6 - all other filesystems (ide and scsi) fsck
works fine.  The same happens in 2.3.10, but 2.3.5 is fine.
I'm stumped as to how to go about finding what could be causing the
problem, let alone fixing it...
