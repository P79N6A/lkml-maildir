Maybe I'm missing something, but the rodata section should always stay
r/o, only text needs locking/unlocking, no?
Given that all code in this patch only operates on .text this seems fine,
but the variables/config options are grossly misnamed then.  And actually
making rodata r/o doesn't seem like a pure debugging thing to me either.
