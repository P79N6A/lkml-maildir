fasttrak is nothing more than an ultra version with an special bios
if you don't use this raid bios, there is no difference (for linux)

sure this helps, but he is not even getting near the pci bus
limitations...

my old dual p2-500 had didn't have this problem

eh, disks are not really his problem
(he is getting 30mb/sec with hdparm for each disk, but getting same result
for his /dev/md0)

he didn't test any network performance yet, this is just plain disk
benchmarking...

there is absolutly no performance difference between an fasttrak-100 and
an ultra-100
here benchmark from my system with an fasttrak-tx4 (same card jonathan
has) with WD1800BB :
/dev/hde:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.28 seconds =457.14 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.37 seconds = 46.72 MB/sec
WD1800BB on onboard ultra100 controller :
/dev/hdo:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.28 seconds =457.14 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.58 seconds = 40.51 MB/sec
WD1800BB on onboard ultra33 controller :
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.28 seconds =457.14 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.55 seconds = 25.10 MB/sec

correct, 3 pci busses
but my old system was only 1 pci bus (same mainbord Jonathan is using)
but was getting way higher performance (his raid is getting lower
performance than an single disk)
with only 150mhz more per cpu
