Well, sideways ofcourse! :-)
here's a cat /proc/interrupts from the (BP6) box:
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:     104936     105433    IO-APIC-edge  timer

  3:         79         59    IO-APIC-edge  serial

The interrupt which caused problems was 19 (with both network cards and USB on
it). It shows a high number of interrupts because I've been load-testing the
network. The mere fact that it shows this hig number of interrupts shows the
fix works...
As this is a BP6, I'm now supposed to go on about the dead chickens, dedicated
air conditioners, nuclear powersupplies and other magic you're supposed to buy
to get these boards running. Well, nothing of that sort, it is running on a
simple (but high quality) 235W PSU with heatgreased coolers on the CPUs and the
BX xhipset. Nothing is overclocked. CPU and chipset tmeperatures are 24.C and
32.C, respectively.
In short, nothing remarkable. All PCI slots are used, as you can see from my
first posting in this thread (which contains more info on the hardware).
