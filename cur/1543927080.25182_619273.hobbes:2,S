No the merge window for 2.6.24 closed a few weeks ago. TTM wasn't in -mm 
for the 2.6.23 cycle as we hadn't finished the API stabilisation work in 
time. So I don't expect we'll see it before 2.6.25.
I also have a few AGP changes I need to line up to support the chipset 
flushing work I've done to support TTM properly..
