My previous attempt was just commenting out parts of your patch.  But
maybe it's more logical to move the barrier to immediately after the
unlock.
With this patch I can't reproduce the problem, which may not mean very
much, since it was rather a "fragile" bug anyway.  But at least the
fix looks pretty harmless.
Thanks,
Miklos
