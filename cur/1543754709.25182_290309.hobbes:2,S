Shouldn't there be some kind of locking for this? It's random,
but still random corruption sounds a bit too random.
Also you probably have a very hot cache line here, which
may hurt on the bigger machines.
I think it would be better to just get a global random number
for each mm as it is created and then run a fast PRNG with that
state. Maybe even make it per task to improve performance on
multithreaded programs. Or alternatively per cpu state with
different starting points.
