Hi Daniel, since you ask for thoughts :)
yap, is the obvious conclusion, but no, my bet is one problem with USB
and USB guys could put the USB things working. 
I just had remember, my Asrock with VIA8237 and VIA SATA (where I am
write now) is working without quirks and USB guys made a patch, by
coincidence. Since then have been working great.

About Linus patch I have to correct me about what I had write,
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/27/113
«(it used to say "if we have an IO-APIC, don't do this" (my patch), now
it says "if this irq is bound to an IO-APIC, don't do this")»
Or my patch or the Linus patch, not both.

like this:

or simply :

	new_irq = dev->irq & 0xf;
About Stian computer, looking for /proc/interrupts 
11:      30696      27559   IO-APIC-level  uhci_hcd:usb1, uhci_hcd:usb2, uhci_hcd:usb3
have USB on irq 11, with IO-APIC-level, which less acpi is not normal on
low numbers ( <=15  )  be IO-APIC-level,  normally is IO-APIC-edge. 
Could be a ACPI problem .
