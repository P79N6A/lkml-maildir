I've got a new PC system to which I added a RTL-8029 PCI network card. The
card is recognised fine by lspci, but when loading the ne2k-pci module,
this error is given in dmesg:
ne2k-pci 0000:05:00.0: no I/O resource at PCI BAR #0
This happens with both 2.6.22.9 as with 2.6.23.1.

Is this a hardware problem, or is something going wrong in the kernel?
The BIOS is the latest version available for the Asus P5K-SE
motherboard.
