That would make sense. However...
idr_layer_cache is only used for allocations from idr_pre_get().
idr_pre_get() is only called from ida_pre_get().
If this analysis is correct, can this mean that the user has failed to
call ida_pre_get() before idr_get_new() was called?
Though in this case, idr_pre_get() actually *is* called first. Hmm...
I think there's a pretty big chance that kmemcheck is at fault :-(
