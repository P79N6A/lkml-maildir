Go ahead and Lindent mtrr.c, it hasn't been touched by rgooch in a
while...

I would argue both ;-)  He is a Usenet denizen after all.
(takes one to know one... I'm one as well :))
He and davej still have a point.  Your code formatting is non-standard,
and is difficult to read.  A document exists CodingStyle which explains
a good style, and further -why- it is a good style.
Among other reasons, because of long term maintenance.
How do you expect others in the Linux kernel community to review your
code, if it is widely considered difficult to read?  How do you expect
people to maintain your code when are no longer around?  The Linux
kernel will be around long after you and I and others leave kernel
development.  Others need to read and maintain this code.
