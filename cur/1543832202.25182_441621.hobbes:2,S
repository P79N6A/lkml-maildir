Incorrect; what you describe is the core assumption underlying the 
"ata_", "pata_", and "sata_" prefixes.
If the user can attached PATA and SATA devices to a controller, its 
prefix is ata_
If the user can only attach PATA devices, its prefix is pata_
If the user can only attach SATA devices, its prefix is sata_
For the purposes of this convention, user-attached bridges such as 
PATA<->SATA bridges, are ignored.
Most older controllers always fall into pata_, most newer into sata_, 
and an odd few ata_
Its a bug if you don't help maintain these assumptions :)
