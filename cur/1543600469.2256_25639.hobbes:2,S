It's not possible in the general case; e.g. it has to ignore NAT rules
and some of the more advanced features of policy routing
The API is rtnetlink. You can send a RTM_GETROUTE message and the kernel
will send you the routing entry for it; which has the RTN_LOCAL type for
local addresses.

You could resolve the backwards address using rtnetlink again and check
the resulting route for LINK scope.  Again it is only an approximation
and will break in some/many cases.
