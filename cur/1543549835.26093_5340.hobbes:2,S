 Hi,
First of all, i am new to kernel, so please correct me if i am wrong or
explain if i don't get something.
	Why does free_dma get declared with different return types in dma.c ?
from kernel/dma.c (kernel test9-pre6)
#ifdef MAX_DMA_CHANNELS
...
void free_dma(unsigned int dmanr)
...
#else
...
int free_dma(unsigned int dmanr)
...
#endif
from include/asm-i386/dma.h
...
#define MAX_DMA_CHANNELS 8
...
extern void free_dma(unsigned int dmanr)
...
Why does get_dma_list blindly write to a buffer (kernel/dma.c line 73) ?
Is there some way to protect oneself from buffer overflows in kernel
(some memory checking function) ?
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
		Boria
