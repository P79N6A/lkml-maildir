Interesting parallel...
In the last few years there have been multiple cases where people reported
benchmarks where a dual processir gave less thruput then a single
processor. In most cases, the single processor benchmark had saturated the
memory bandwidth and a second processor didn't make much difference.
This was on "cheap" multi-processors.
