I'm seeing this on a handfull of HP DL360G3's, all using the
cciss-driver for RAID; running 2.6.3-mm2 (with Andrews sync-fix
patch). Currently installed with gentoo "testing" (~x86 keyword), and
they will hang on occation when running mke2fs, and about half the
time when executing something like this:
umount /some/dir && mke2fs -j -L /some/dir /dev/cciss/c0d0p5 && mount /some/dir
All filesystems (12 of them) are formatted as ext3, I'm using udev,
not devfs FWIW. Let me know if I can be of more help.
The machines will be fully respons network-wise, it only seems that
disk I/O hangs at that point; it wont perform a new login or an
already open prompt won't do anything but hang at that point.
mvh,
A
