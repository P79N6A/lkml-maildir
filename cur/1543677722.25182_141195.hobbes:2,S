Overview:
K42 is a operating-system research project (available under LGPL) 
focused in large part on scalability in the implementation of core 
OS services.  We will give a brief overview of the project, discuss 
some of the recent performance results running 64-bit PPC Linux binaries 
and discuss the major ways that our implementation of Linux services 
depart from the norm (hopefully making sure to bring up all the truly 
offensive and contentious ways).  We will leave most of the time for
questions and discussion.
