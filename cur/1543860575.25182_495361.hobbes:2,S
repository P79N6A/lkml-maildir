typedef int gpio_t would hurt, and would serve as a useful
documentation hint. Furthermore, you could switch it to enum on
platform where it makes sense.

Saying it is an error would be okay by me. (Or "Behaviour of these calls for
GPIOs that can't be safely accessed without sleeping is undefined.").

Sorry.

Ok, I mis-read your specs as trying to push warnings into the scope.

Ok, "debug behaviour is out of scope, again".
What about "Behavour of reading a GPIO that hasn't been marked as an
input using gpio_set_direction() is implementation-defined"?
