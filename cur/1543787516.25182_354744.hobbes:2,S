My old 500MHz P3 can xor at 1GB/sec.  I don't think the RAID5 logic is the
issue!  Also, I have not seen hardware that fast!  Or even half as fast.
But I must admit, I have not seen a hardware RAID5 in a few years.  :(
   8regs     :   918.000 MB/sec
   32regs    :   469.600 MB/sec
   pIII_sse  :   994.800 MB/sec
   pII_mmx   :  1102.400 MB/sec
   p5_mmx    :  1152.800 MB/sec
raid5: using function: pIII_sse (994.800 MB/sec)
Humm..  It did not select the fastest?
