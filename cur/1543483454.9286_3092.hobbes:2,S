Presumably all you need to provide are skeleton kernels with root partition
support (normally ide+ext2, but I guess there are other combinations, esp.
for different architectures), and then everything else as modules. But then,
this is what RedHat, Slackware, ... do anyway, otherwise you'd never be
able to install them. So what's the problem?
Sure, you can't build a wonderfully optimized kernel using megagcc 6.5.27,
but you have to draw the line somewhere. If you want to do this, you might
have to scrounge another disk. Certainly over here, disk space is less than
EUR 0.04/Mb... 
Failing all else, 2.0 is perfectly stable anyway, and I imagine Alan and
folks will periodically back-port serious bug fixes for quite a while,
anyway.
Remember, with commercial operating systems, you don't even get the chance
to recompile the kernel (sure, on SCO you can relink it..) - so don't knock
that which you get for free, unless you're prepared to help fix it.
"I can't compile the kernel on my single floppy Amiga, why is the kernel
