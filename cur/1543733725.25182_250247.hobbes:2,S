If I have a framebuffer driver loaded for my video card in bitmap mode
all is well. If I unload it you then disable the video hardware even
though it would still be otherwise usable in text mode.
The same occurs when one PCI device has multiple functions (not PCI
functions but linux drivers using it). There are some examples of this
such as the CS5520 where one BAR is the IDE controller.
