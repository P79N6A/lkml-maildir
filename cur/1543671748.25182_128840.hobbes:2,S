	Actually, it should probably be encapsualted in
TOSHIBA_OLD. But unfortunately, there is more than that, trust me.

	First, please verify if you have the same problem when the
full IrDA stack and drivers are modular.
	I would expect the same behaviour in 2.5.X and 2.4.X, because
it's the same driver. I personally don't have this hardware, so can't
do much, and the maintainer are unresponsive. It supposed to work
better if you pass the flag to bypass the self test.
	Also, most modern Toshiba laptops seems to have SMC instead of
toshoboe hardware.
