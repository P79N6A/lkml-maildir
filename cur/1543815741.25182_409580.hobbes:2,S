It sure sounds like it to me.

I'll have to first make sure I can reproduce the problem on SLES10 beta
(since I'm not the one who saw it), then go off and take a look at the
SLES10 beta kernel source and patches to see what's going on.
The SLES10 beta kernels have been following 2.6.16 very closely (each
one has been either based on a git snapshot or a release candidate), but
there's a biggish quilt patch stack on top.  *If* there's a bug at all,
I wouldn't be surprised if it's somewhere in that pile of patches.
