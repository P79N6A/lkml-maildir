I'm sure lib/ will be appropriate place. and something like
"DON'T TRY REINVENT WHEEL, TRY FIX EXISTS" in documentation/ :).
Now couple word about rheap: I understand why you are use static
alignment in allocator, but its very specialized for CPM. IMO, align
must be a param of xx_alloc. For ex: device may demand alignment by
8 bytes, which ok until... you are try map this memory to the user
space (don't shoot at me, remember about framebuffer & co).
