Subject: [PATCH] ide: Workaround PM problem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The logic in ide_do_request() doesn't guarantee that both drives will be
serviced after a call. It may "forget" to service one in some circumstances,
including when one of the drive is suspended (it will eventually fail to
service the slave when the master is suspended for example). This prevents
the wakeup requests that gets queued on wakeup from sleep from beeing serviced
in some cases when 2 drives are sharing an IDE bus.
The problem is deep enough in the way this code works (and there are probably
a few other problematic but rare corner cases) and fixing it would require
some major rethinking of the way IDE decides which channel to service. This
is not 2.6.14 material. However, in the meantime, Bart has accepted this simple
workaround that will fix the crash on wakeup from sleep since this specific
corner case is actually hitting users to get into 2.6.14.
