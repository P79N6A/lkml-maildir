First of all i used :
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root       695871 Oct 18 04:07
isdn-9910180206.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root      5101687 Oct 23 13:00
isdn4k-utils-9910231100.tar.gz
on both 2.2.12 and 2.2.13 kernels.
I noticed ipppd on 2.2.13 was failing at this step :
(line 640 of sys-linux.c on ipppd source )
                if (ioctl(sockfd, SIOCADDRT, &rt) < 0) {
                        int severity;
                        /*
                         * It's not fatal IMHO if the route already
exists!
                         * Give a notice, though...
                         */
in the log the following was printed :
Oct 25 22:54:17 localhost ipppd[363]: ioctl(SIOCADDRT) device route
(ippp0/151.99.104.0/ffffff00): Network is down
i forced the severity at LOG_NOTICE by putting an 
     severity = LOG_NOTICE;
just after the errno test and i was able to connect.
Now , why does it happen on 2.2.13 and not on 2.2.13, with the same
configuration ?
