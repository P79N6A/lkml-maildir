I checked my configuration,
Scsi is auto termicateing
and all scsi controller is ID 7
The computer have been pre-installed WIN NT properly.
I think when "boot" dsiplayed, it should type some option
Please help me.
thanks very much

I think you have a hardware problem...
	1) Is your SCSI autoterminating?
	2) If not, do you have it terminated correctly?
	3) Do you have your SCSI IDs set correctly, assuming ID7 for the
host?
	4) Does any other OS successfully install on your messed up system?
	5) Did you exhaust all other local resources before bothering high
level kernel gurus?
