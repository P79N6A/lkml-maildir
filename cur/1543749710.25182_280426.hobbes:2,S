    I want to intercept system calls that are provided
for IPC in Linux. I have to determine whether a
process blocks while executing a system call and I
must save the arguments passed to that system call.
    Can I modify the system call source code directly
for this? or if I want the system calls to refer my
module, how should I do that? can anyone explain for
this, if possible with some code?..
Thanks,
selva
