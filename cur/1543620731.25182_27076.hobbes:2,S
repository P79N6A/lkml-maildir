There are at least 2 reasons that I can see why Linus probably won't
accept your patch:
	1. It is not an inline text attachment (it is a URL).
	2. It is 79,000 lines long
If you could send the patch in smaller chunks over time, or ask one of
Linus' closer (read Highly Trusted) patch maintainers to apply it to
his/her tree first and get some testing, he might be more inclined to
accept it.
