Actually all the VCD stuff is a mix of the Chinese government and
Philips. The specs are available although pricy.
The kernel provides the infrastructure for arbitary CD handling, but
provides only the file system support in kernel. It can't (and doesn't
appear to need to) handle VCD in kernel it provides the tools to Xine
and friends instead.
