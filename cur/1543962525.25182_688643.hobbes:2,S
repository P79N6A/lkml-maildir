Shouldn't we fix the perl-script to mark the constants appropriately 
typed? Ie add the proper "ul" or "ull" endings there as necessary?
For example, I see
	#define MSEC_TO_HZ_ADJ64        0x18000000000000000
in the auto-generated timeconst.h file, and the fact is, that's a really 
really ugly constant. It simply doesn't even fit in a u64. Why do these 
kinds of pointless and useless #define even get generated, when using them 
would inevitably be a bug anyway?
As to the ones that *do* fit in 64 bits, they should still haev the 
correct "ul" and "ull" endings on 64- and 32-bit architectures 
respectively. Yeah, hex constants are always unsigned and the compiler 
will expand them to the right size, but the compiler is also rigth to warn 
about it (and casting them shouldn't even change that fact, even if it 
happens to do so with gcc).
