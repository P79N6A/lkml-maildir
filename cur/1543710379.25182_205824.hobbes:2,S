I was WONDERING why certain things would get corrupted on the screen when
using the radeon framebuffer driver.  I've been seeing a number of
off-by-one errors.
First of all, the kernel source I'm looking at is 2.4.22-gentoo-r7.
Anyhow, here's the deal.  Look at the function 'fbcon_radeon_bmove'.  I'm
having to type this in by hand due to circumstances, so, here's something
that looks vaguely like a patch but which will require people to actually
look at (I've never submitted a patch before, so let's just discuss it
first):
line 4399:
    if (srcy < dsty) {
-        srcy += height;
-        dsty += height;
+        srcy += height-1;
+        dsty += height-1;
    } else
line 4404:
    if (srcx < dstx) {
-        srcx += width;
-        dstx += width;
+        srcx += width-1;
+        dstx += width-1;
    }
