Subject: another must-fix: major PS/2 mouse problem

Lots of people (check Google) get this message
from the kernel:
psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
(the number of bytes will be 1, 2, or 3)
At work, I get it when there is heavy NFS traffic.
The mouse goes crazy, jumping around and doing
random cut-and-paste all over everything. This is
with a decently fast and modern PC.
I'll guess that NFS and the mouse both have worker
threads fighting for CPU time, and neither is RT.
