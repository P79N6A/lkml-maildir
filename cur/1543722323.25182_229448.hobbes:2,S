Can you check out in more details the OS X driver ? I think there
need to be some i2s tweaking when changing the format and/or the
frequency. Doing that right would allow to support 8 & 16 bits
properly at least. 
Also, don't leave the commented out line, especially with  the c++
style comments. If the chip can byteswap, make sure you have proper
code to do this, if not, leave can_byteswap to 0, or people will
experience all sorts of funny troubles ;)
Ben.
