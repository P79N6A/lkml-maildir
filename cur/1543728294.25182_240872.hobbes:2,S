to make sure this is a real latency and not some rdtsc weirdness, could
you try the latest version of preempt-timing:
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/preempt-timing-on-2.6.8-rc3-O5-A2
this adds jiffies-based latency values to the printout, e.g.:
  (ksoftirqd/0/2): 3860us [3 jiffy] non-preemptible critical section
  violated 100 us preempt threshold starting at ___do_softirq+0x1b/0x90
  and ending at cond_resched_softirq+0x57/0x70
shows that a 10 jiffy (10 msec) latency happened - which matches the
rdtsc-based 3860 usecs value.
