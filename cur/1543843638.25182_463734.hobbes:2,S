Oh well. I'm working on unpopular and intrusive stuff as long as you do.
Just our ways to work and communicate differ slightly.

Ouch. Can you please tell me what's the technical merit of this
paragraph:
"                               ... The only reasons
there are separate project teams is because managers in key
positions made the decision that they'd rather break from existing
projects which had had little success mainlining and instead use
their corporate bodyweight to pressure/seduce kernel developers
working for them into pushing their new great which-aboslutely-
has-nothing-to-do-with-this-ltt-crap-(no,no, we actually agree
with you kernel developers that this is crap, this is why we're
developing this new amazing thing). That's the truth plain and
simple."
