Hello all,
  While 'make bzImage', I received the following error
presto.c: In function `presto_get_permit':
presto.c:625: structure has no member named `p_pptr'
presto.c: In function `presto_put_permit':
presto.c:682: structure has no member named `p_pptr'
presto.c: In function `presto_is_read_only':
presto.c:1136: structure has no member named `p_pptr'
presto.c:1139: structure has no member named `p_pptr'
presto.c:1132: warning: `mask' might be used uninitialized in this function
make[2]: *** [presto.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/fs/intermezzo'
make[1]: *** [intermezzo] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/fs'
make: *** [fs] Error 2
I think that presto_c2m(presto_cache *cache) (looked at dir.c) needs to be 
used, but I attempted that, and it didn't seem to work.
Regards,
Frank
