What about a different way of circumventing the GPL only symbols?
What prevents the author of a non-GPL module who needs access to a
GPL-only symbol from writing a small GPLed module which imports the 
GPL-only symbol (this is allowed, because the small module is GPL), 
and exports a basically identical symbol without the GPL-only
restriction?
Then he could use this new symbol from his non-GPL module.
