Ok, great. None of those quirks are very interesting per se (they're all 
in the old legacy region), but that 0xf9-0xfc one is interesting if only 
because it points out that I should be more careful about the mask/base 
logic.
That quirk is actually set up in a very special way, where it ignores 
address line #1, and devres J actually covers two PIO ports: 0xf9 and 0xfb 
(but not the one between). Odd, but it's documented hardware behaviour.
So the 0xf9-0xfc thing is strictly not right, and I'll modify my code a 
bit (probably to mark 0xf8-0xfb instead, which will be what we'd want to 
do for anything in the non-legacy region).

Thanks, that lspci output was what I needed to verify the mask details.
The printouts look good. I wish somebody had a PIIX with a MMIO quirk just 
to verify that I got that case right too, but it's pretty unlikely that is 
ever used in practice.
