That is basically Lustre.  One filesystem (the metadata filesystem, MDS)
holds just the pathnames and some EA data that points to other files
(these are essentially "file continuation inodes").  The data filesystems
(object storage filesystems, OST) have the file data RAID0 striped over
multipe OST "objects".  The objects are just regular files stored in
ext3 filesystems.
In clustered metadata Lustre (CMD) there are also continuation inodes for
files in a single directory, but currently a 2TB MDS filesystem is plenty
big for holding just filenames and inodes.
The same problems exist with Lustre that you have to face with the
continuation inode scheme - files that grow too large for a single
chunk, cross-chunk namespace links, etc.
Of course we'd be thrilled if there was a desire to implement Lustre
at a completely local-filesystem level (removing a lot of the networking
and required recovery mechanism), though it would also be desirable to
have the ability to move a filesystem from a local box to a distributed
filesystem (ala X11) without any changes.

Interesting, I'll have to take a look.

It continually amazes me that XFS even made it into the kernel as it
currently stands, because of the normally vehement objections to any
kind of abstraction of code.
