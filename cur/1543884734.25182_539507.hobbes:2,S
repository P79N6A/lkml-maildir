xfs problem was real. And I do not see that many problems caused by
freezing kernel threads:  at least you get deadlocks, not silent fs
corruption.

Yep, so we have md doing io while we are doing atomic copy. That
probably means it will continue when atomic copy is done... getting
image out of sync with disk.
(Plus we used to have bdflush, doing periodic writes to disk).

Well, if freezing the disk was available, I'd gladly do it. Is there
easy way to implement that?
