Or in other words:
  - When a new scope is opened, increase indentations by 8 characters.
    Use a tab for that.
  - When wrapping within an expression, start the new line at the same
    column at which the (sub-)expression started.
  - Deviations from the latter rule allowed if it increases readability.

What I said at the top of this posting has not been newly grown recently
but has been common practice for many years.  It's not my personal style.
(Note, I'm not saying one style is better than the other, nor am I
saying that only one style can be allowed, nor am I saying that it's
fine to have several different styles.)
