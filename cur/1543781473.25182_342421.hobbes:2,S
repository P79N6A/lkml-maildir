Ok, it does sound like your X server is doing something nasty on the PCI 
bus.

It would be even more interesting if you have a serial console, but if
this is the X server stomping on the PCI bus, you might just have a total
lockup - no oops, no nothing.
One thing that might be interesting is to see if the old working kernel
has a different IO-map than the broken ones. A simple
	cat /proc/ioports /proc/iomem > iomaps.kernel-version
and diffing the two might be an interesting thing to try. X has been known
to sometimes just try to re-configure things on its own without telling
(or asking) the kernel.
