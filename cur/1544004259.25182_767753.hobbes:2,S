But it will fail in a totally silent and mysterious way.  Doesn't it
seem better to verify the values when you can return a meaningful error
code to the caller?
The other ioctl() calls have the same issue; you can start the thread
with nonsensical values for the number of pages to scan and the sleep
time.

What about things like cache effects from scanning all those pages?  My
guess is that, if you're trying to run dozens of Windows guests, cache
usage is not at the top of your list of concerns, but I could be
wrong.  Usually am...
