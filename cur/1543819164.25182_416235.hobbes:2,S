Ideally, what I'd like to do on powerpc is to dedicate one register to
storing a per-cpu base address or offset, and be able to resolve the
offset at link time, so that per-cpu variable accesses just become a
register + offset memory access.  (For modules, "link time" would be
module load time.)
We *might* be able to use some of the infrastructure that was put into
gcc and binutils to support TLS (thread local storage) to achieve
this.  (See 
http://people.redhat.com/drepper/tls.pdf
 for some of the
details of that.)
Also, I've added Rusty Russell to the cc list, since he designed the
per-cpu variable stuff in the first place, and would be able to
explain the trade-offs that led to the PERCPU_ENOUGH_ROOM thing.  (I
think you're discovering them as you go, though. :)
Paul.
