Not sure this is a good idea.  Usually you want a lock protect slightly
more than just list operations, e.g. refcounting of objects in list,
some short-term manipulations, etc.

Yikes.  It's really not that hard to get traversal of a refcounted list
right, and you're adding lots of obsfucation over that rather easy thing.
The driver model and kfoo stuff already got us lots of layer of obsfucation,
but we should really stop at some point where it makes the underlying
operations much more complicated.

This sounds rather odd, and doesn't make much sense to me.  In all cases
I've seen you want to disallow lookup imediately (list_del), which is
completly separate from object lifetime rules.
