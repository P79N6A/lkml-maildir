I recently indulged in a marathon compile-a-thon (glibc 2.2.3, X 4.1.0 and
all the things they are dependent on) and at the end of this I found that
ppp was no longer dialling on demand correctly.  What appears to be
happening is that ip_dynaddr isn't working properly.  The first connection
(the one which initiated the dial) fails.
Prior to noticing the problem with ppp I also upgraded to 2.4.9 of the
kernel.  So my question is this, is there a known problem with ip_dynaddr
or is it more likely to be a problem with the default configuration of DNS
lookups in glibc as I have seen suggested elsewhere?
