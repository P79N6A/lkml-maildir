Obviously if you try using EH it will always crash hard. That
would be really stupid.

Er, C++ does not imply `gigantic stack usage'.
However, C++ *will* be discomfited by `struct class', and unless you
want to rule out use of sysfs you're going to have to use it at some
point. And *that* is a bit of a killer unless you want to write half
your app in C and half in C++, which is getting a bit silly.

It's a quite different language which happens to share a lot of ancestry
with C, and which happens to make link-time compatibility with C fairly
easy. Therefore it looks fairly similar; but it is *not* that similar,
not any more. Good C code and good C++ code look utterly different,
and good C++ code probably has no place in the kernel (making, as it
does, heavy use of the templated standard C++ library).
But, no, it doesn't belong in the kernel. (If you're writing a
filesystem, though, filesystem drivers in C++ --- or, for that matter,
Perl, Java or Haskell --- are quite practicable, thanks to the merging
of FUSE.)
