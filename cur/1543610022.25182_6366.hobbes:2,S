Whats probably closer to the truth is..
  make cpu

  smp tests run ok ? ------> No, sell as XP
     |
  yes, sell as MP
The same as tests are done to test if they can run at 2GHz. If any
test fails, its tried as at 1.9Ghz, and 1.8Ghz until the tests pass.
One chip yield may run at certain speeds fine, whilst others don't.
How is this relevant ?
Well, overclockers found that the sample of a yield wasn't true of
all cpu silicon from that yield, and that some 1800's run at 1900 with no
problem.  Just as SOME XP users are reporting problems in SMP whilst
some are not.
Burning out a fuse to make the switch from MP->XP may affect more
than just the cpuid capabilities. The fact is _we don't know_

I've yet to see a socket 370 dual processormotherboard that
I'd put faith in for a mission critical environment.
"I had no problems" means _nothing_ when theres as few as 1 other
user reporting SMP related problems with the same setup.

Three models. There are considerably more out there.
Note, that model 6 isn't really 'old', a thunderbird for eg is
model 4. "old" was used relatively in my original mail.
