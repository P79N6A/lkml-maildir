Not quite, because a single 32MB write might take what? 500ms to
complete... and the IO scheduler wants to stop writes after 60ms
if there are waiting reads.
And writes will be more likely to be submitted as large requests.
I think Jeff is right that in theory though, the drivers should
just export their capabilities, and the block layer or IO scheduler
should decide on the maximum size to actually use.
