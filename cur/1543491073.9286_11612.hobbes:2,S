	Uh-Oh, so everybody on this list decided to get his initials, a number, a few patches and appended them
to the current linux kernel.
	The only unified and valuable patches I've seen so far were the ac series, so, next time, have mercy
with us, "the Patchers", and please send'em to Alan, I don't want to apply 3 or 4 patches just to have
a some kinda working kernel :-(
