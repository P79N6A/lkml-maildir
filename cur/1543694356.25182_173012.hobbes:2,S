An highmem user can make use of lowmem too. Think a 1G box, it looks
wrong to disallow highmem to shrink the 800M of dcache in the normal/dma
zones.
I wonder if what he's suffering from is a reduced normal zone due the
mem_map_t being larger. The reduced normal zone will trigger the dcache
shrinking more frequently. But he may want to try again with 2.4.23pre7
with a classzone aware refill_inactive that will ensure the inactive
list has enough lowmem pages before shrink_caches claims failure.
