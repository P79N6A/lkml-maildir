I'm seeing 500 zombied instances of khelper (from udev startup).  It only
happens when the utrace patches are applied.  Presumably an interaction
between utrace and one of these kthread changes.
I'll drop utrace for now.  I don't think it's getting much help from being
in -mm at present and it's getting increasingly painful to keep it merged
against all the other stuff which is happening.
Roland, I'll squirt all the extra utrace patches which I have in your direction.
Please merge them or hang on to them for later on.
