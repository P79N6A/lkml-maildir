Ok this helped keep the cmdline around but the early_param is still
busted with 2.6.18-rc3-mm2 (I don't have cmdline problem with non -mm
2.6.18-rc3).
I am booting with numa=hotadd=100 on x86_64.  The parameter
hotadd_percent is not getting setup right. Printk tells me that
numa_setup is not called during boot.
if I change
early_param("numa=", numa_setup);
to
early_param("numa", numa_setup);
The parameter hotadd_percent is setup right but there is a
"Malformed early option 'numa'" message.
Is there some other patch that I missed to fix this?
Also it seems like the earlyconsole isn't getting setup right.... It
seems to take forever to start (say about 20-30 seconds) This pause in
the boot is caused by the reserve hot-add patch but early console
should start before the pause.
command line is root=/dev/sda3
ip=9.47.66.153:9.47.66.169:9.47.66.1:255.255.255.0 resume=/dev/sda2
showopts earlyprintk=ttyS0,115200 console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty0
debug numa=hotadd=100
Again thing work as expected with 2.6.18-rc3.
Thanks,
  Keith
