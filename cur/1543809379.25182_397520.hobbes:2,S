Exactly.  2.6.16-rc2-mm1 without my patch has a delay of .15 to .50s.
2.6.16-rc1 with my patch had a reported delay of from .19 to .45s.
That's identical in my book.  My patch to rc1 also contained Con's
changes that are in mm, that's constant.  Subtracting the variable, my
patch, made no difference.  Con's changes may be responsible for the
behavior change, but mine are certainly not.
