Can you also add a comment which points at the Intel documentation?
http://download.intel.com/design/chipsets/datashts/30300702.pdf
Page 34 documents 0xf4 register.
And I just doubled checked that the 0xf4 register value is restored later
in the quirk (obvious when you look at the code but not from the patch).

Yeah, this should work even though we don't have a dev for it.
