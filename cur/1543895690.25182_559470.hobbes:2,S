It couldn't possibly be.  The whole point of upgrading the GPL is such
that it complies better with its spirit of defending the freedoms, so
as to keep free software free.  This can only be accomplished with
additional restrictions that stop practices that deny users'
freedoms.
Relaxing the provisions, a necessary condition for compatibility,
wouldn't make for better defenses.

I'm not sure what you mean by "rights" in the two sentences above.
You know you can grant additional permissions, so I assume that's not
what you mean, even more so because you *can* indeed take them out.
Is it "conditions", "restrictions" or some such, that in turn
translate into freedoms for downstream users, or is it about the
granted rights per se?

Impossible is a bit too strong.  I understand it would take a huge
amount of work though, so I sympathize with "it wouldn't be worth it",
even if, in my scale of moral values, I'd disagree.
