The "derivative work" distinction in law, which can be quite complex
because it involves issues like intent. Other than the intentional clear
statement that the syscall interface is considered a barrier by the
authors there is no other statement.
The GPL grants of patents are having a similar effect too, you'll need a
patent license from IBM to write RCU using code for example unless its
free software.
You also appear to misunderstand dual licensing. If you have a GPL/BSD
dual licensed module then when its using GPL'd code it ends up a
combined GPL work you can't add binary blocks too (except as per being
"not a derivative work")
