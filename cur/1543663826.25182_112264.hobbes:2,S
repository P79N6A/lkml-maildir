FYI Frank, three things.  First of all, I really don't like the
interface of adding a second address to ptrace; I believe it interferes
with PIC on x86, since IIRC the extra argument would go in %ebx.  The
BSDs have a nice interface involving passing a request structure. 
Secondly, the implementation should be in kernel/ptrace.c not under
i386, we're trying to stop doing that.
Thirdly, I was going to do this, but I ended up making GDB use pread64
on /dev/mem instead.  It works with no kernel modifications, and is
just as fast.
