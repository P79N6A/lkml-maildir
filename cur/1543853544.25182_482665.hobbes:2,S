You also need an ADSL library. That info is available, but it takes a *lot* of
hard work to implement. On the other hand, all future adsl drivers can use
the library. Dsl drivers are closed source because of this library. If such
library existed, there would be no reason for manufacturers to do closed
source Linux drivers.

I have 3 cards working now. Alcatel also sold it, as 'Speedtouch PC'. So it
must be more than 45 ;-)
