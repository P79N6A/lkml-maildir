OK. I look through Jonathan's patch[1], but didn't find a proper tag
as you suggested. I think the "Reported-by:" tag may be appropriate,
as the above.
So, we need a "Reported-by:" tag, Jonathan. Could you please consider
to add it into your patch? I didn't see it in -mm1 tree or I can give
you a patch.
