I don't think that belongs in Linux/Documentation since it's
specific to RedHat.  Apart from the "which UHCI" confusion,
you could use the /etc/rc.d/init.d/hotplug script to start
up USB. (That's not part of RedHat though; they use kudzu to
promote what seems like more of a static config model.)
I have an RH 7.3 system that has this ... though I had to
tweak it by hand since their setup stored multiple entries
for some drivers, and didn't put EHCI first (so devices on
USB 2.0 adapters would start out with one driver, disconnect,
then reconnect using the "right" host controller):
	alias usb-controller  ehci-hcd
	alias usb-controller1 ohci-hcd
	alias usb-controller2 uhci-hcd
	alias usb-controller3 usb-ohci
	alias usb-controller4 usb-uhci
Note that the "uhci-hcd" would be "usb-uhci-hcd" if you're trying
to experiment with that version on the 2.5 kernel, if you're not
doing manual rmmod/modprobe (which I usually end up doing).
That causes silly boot messages for the hardware or drivers you
may not have, but works reliably/correctly for all current kernels.
