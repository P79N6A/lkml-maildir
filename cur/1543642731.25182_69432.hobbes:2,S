Eh?  In this case, Al Viro's scheme is really simple and works: the
kern_mount keeps the module use-count non-zero so long as any file
descriptors are using the module's filesystem.  fput() decrements the
use-count at a safe time -- no race conditions.
The expected behaviour is as it has always been: rmmod fails if anyone
is using the module, and succeeds if nobody is using the module.  The
garbage collection of modules is done using "rmmod -a" periodically, as
it always has been.
