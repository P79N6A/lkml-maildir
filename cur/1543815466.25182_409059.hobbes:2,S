Subject: Question: where should the SCSI driver place MODE_SENSE data ?

In the 2.6 (2.6.9 and scsi-misc in git) kernel, MODE_SENSE SCSI command
packet (scsi_cmnd) carries following entries with unexpectedly small in
size.
- request_bufflen
- bufflen
Especially for MODE SENSE with page code 8 (caching page), driver has
minumum 12 Bytes MODE_SENSE data to deliver besides 'mode parameter
header' and 'block descriptors'.
When I dump those entries, they both are 4 Bytes in size.
To me, it seems like that SCSI mid layer allocated 512 Bytes for
MODE_SENSE data buffer, but the buffer length passed down to LLD
incorrectly.
Please guide me if there is anything missing.
Thank you,
Seokmann
