Ok, thanks for the hint.
Currently one can do 'ifconfig ethX up', check the link status, then try
to DHCP or whatever. Apparently a few drivers do not support tne detection
of link as presented above. So is it anything like a vendor requirement/a
standard (or should it be the new right way (TM)) or does the userspace
needs fixing wrt its expectation ?
The lack of irq means that netif_carrier_on/off can not be reliable until
the device is up. It is a bit worrying.
