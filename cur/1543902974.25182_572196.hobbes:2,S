I a absolutely agree. My first impulse was to get rid of all the cpp
kludge including the Kconfig setting CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ, since, as you
pointed out, request_irq() is not really performance critical.
Unfortunately for the RFC I decided to be conservative and ended up with
an "ifdef maze". Thank you for the heads-up.

Yup.

I am afraid that in some occasions the kernel may panic inside the
interrupt handler, but I agree that we need to print a meaningful
message for the general case (i.e. something goes wrong but we can
recover). I will do that.

In the new version of the patch I will remove both
CONFIG_DEBUG_PENDING_IRQ and CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ. request_irq() and
setup_irq() are not fast paths and free_irq() much less so.

I guess the Kconfig setting is not needed. In fact, by enabling this
feature unconditionally we would have _everyone_ (unknowing) testing an
area which is a major pain point for kdump. I am not sure this is an
acceptable default for all systems though. Opinions welcome.

I will do that and submit updated patches.
Thank you for your feedback, Andrew!
