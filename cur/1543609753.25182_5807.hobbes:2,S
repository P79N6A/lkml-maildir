Zip is best defined by it's total lack of quality, I can't keep those
around for long before they either break or become unsupported when they
release a larger drive and as much as I wish LS-120 was a standard
feature.. it's not.
I can't use CDs because I often need something custom.  Just try booting a  
Dell PowerEdge using the standard Debian install CD, it won't work (needs
custom patched kernel).  Removing floppy support would be a shafting of
monumental proportions.
As much as I hate floppies, I'm stuck with em.  I doubt I'm the only one
either.
