Hi,
I have a little trouble writing a module under 2.2.x... The relevant
parts is, that it should send a packet (which is created from scratch).
Just send a packet. Well, I've tried around many days, read really many
sources and when I thought, I've found the right way, it ended up in an
oops or the function couldn't be used in a module because it wasn't
exported (It's important that this does not to change anything at the
kernel-source itself).
My main problem is that I don't know how to add the linklevel-headers
hardware-independently...
But lets say I've managed to add the ll-headers...
Then, I put the packet into an skb.
then I calculate the routes with ip_route_output.
then I submit the packet with dev_queue_xmit and do a ip_rt_put.
Do I make a mistake here?
I would be happy if someone could point me to a module which does sth
like this, I haven't found anything yet... I'd _really_ like to see the
source of a module which does sth. similar.
