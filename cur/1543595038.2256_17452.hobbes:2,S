Hi,
I'm maintaining a device driver that has recently had the ability to
control multiple units added to it.  At present, applications can get info
on the driver's and hardware's status through a file in /proc/driver.  
What I would like to know is what the prefered way to handle multiple
devices is:  multiple files in /proc/driver or one file with multiple
sections in it?
As the developer of the driver's associated user space utilities I think
my preference is for multiple files because that keeps those apps as
simple as possible.  As the developer of the driver, however, having a
single /proc file and a loop is the simplest solution.  So is there an
(un)official position on this sort of thing or should I flip a coin?
