	DOS was a example, and personally I'd prefer to not have the vendors 
having the hack the linux kernel in order to be able to provide an ability 
to upgrade the firmware.  As it is now there is a nice simple interface they
may be able to use.
	You only have to reset the device you flash.  Sometimes you
don't *have* to do that.  With SCSI a system can be configured such that
you could do the upgrade w/ the machine running and then just reset the
device.  Similar can be done with IDE, though I've only done it on IDE
CDROM drives and not yet with a HD.  I do suspect it would work though.
