Are there plans in the near future to support proper LWP's in the Linux
kernel ?  By this I mean multiple threads of execution within the same
process id, not multiple processes sharing the same VM, etc.  Can I
encourage whoever is considering doing this that it would be a very
good thing to do ? :)
Cheers,
Darren
