Something is definitely needed.  Currently on a 4-way SMP machine,
nfsd might only use 1 CPU (depends a bit on irq routing I think).
If that patch is too big, maybe this one?

--------------------------------
Avoid using nfsd process pools on SMP machines.
From: Neil Brown <neilb@suse.de>
process-pools have real benefits for NUMA, but on SMP
machines they only work if network interface interrupts
go to all CPUs (via round-robin or multiple nics).  This is
not always the case, so disable the pools in this case until
a better solution is developped.
