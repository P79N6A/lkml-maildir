There is no way it will compile with a modern GCC, you need to use a compiler that was around at the time, (I have no idea what that would be!).
The reason is that both the kernel and GCC have bugs in them, and the kernel is generally coded to work around bugs in the current versions of GCC - so you can't use any compiler to compile any kernel.
