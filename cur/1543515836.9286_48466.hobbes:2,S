Hi Linus,
  someone played with MM again. Probably he noticed
that two weeks ago I added call to __get_pages() into
ncpfs mmap code and took it as good reason for removing
this function from kernel public interface :-(
  This patch switches my code back to __get_free_page().
Diff was generated on the top of 2.3.27-pre6.
  Thanks for applying this. I hope that MM code stabilizes
soon.
