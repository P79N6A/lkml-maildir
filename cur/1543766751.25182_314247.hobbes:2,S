Concider netlink_broadcast - it delivers skb to the kernel 
listener directly to the input callback - no queueing actually,
the same is for netlink_unicast - so in-kernel users are always 
called synchronously.
send() [sys_send()] system call(which btw as syscall does schedule too) 
ends up in netlink_sendmsg and thus either netlink_broadcast and 
netlink_unicast, which is called directly as we have seen.
