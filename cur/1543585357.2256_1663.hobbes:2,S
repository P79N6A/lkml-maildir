...and then we can let the disc go nuts seeking to actually commit all
these new blocks.  I suspect that this change would only be a win for
memory-based discs where seek time is zero.
I think that before anyone starts modifying the kernel for this they
should benchmark how often the free block checker blocks on lock
contention _AND_ how often the thread its contending with is looking
for a free block in a _different_ allocation group.  I bet it's not
often at all.

That sounds more promising.

If we're going to assume that e2fsck will correct the numbers anyway then
there's really no reason to update them any time except when marking
the filesystem clean (umount, remount-ro)  As a bonus, we have to update
the superblock then anyway.
