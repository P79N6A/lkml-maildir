I think I could sched some light on this option. 
It was needed when I was implementing SMB-to-FS connector (basically mapping 
msnet into filesystem hierarchy), using smbmount to actually mount shares 
over fuse-supported directory tree. smbmount (and sbmnt, in turn) needs to be 
able to access mountpoint, and, unfortunately, this access is done under 
setuid(0). allow_other can't be used in many cases, f.e. when user mounts 
MSNet tree over /mnt  (and can't protect /mnt with standard and proper 
attributes ).
