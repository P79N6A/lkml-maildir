Btw, on another note: to avoid the appearance of recursion, I'd prefer a
	p = leader;
	goto top;
instead of a "release_task(leader);".
I realize that the recursion should be just one deep (the leader of the
leader is itself, and that will stop the thing from going further), but it
looks trivial to avoid it, and any automated source checking tool would be
confused by the apparent recursion.
