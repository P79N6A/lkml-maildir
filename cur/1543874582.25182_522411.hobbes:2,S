There was a recent regression report on ahci + HTS541010G9SA00 from
Mathieu Berard (cc'd).  NCQ + device initiated link power saving (which,
BTW, got activated by executing _GTF.  surprise!) combination seems
broken.  I know that ahci controllers (at least ich6m, ich7 and ich8)
work with device initiated PS, so it's most likely the disk that's
malfunctioning.
This and the fact sata_sil24 windows driver blacklists them make me
think those HTS5410s should be added to our blacklist too.  What do you
think?
Mathieu, just to be sure, can you post the result of 'hdparm -I
/dev/sdX' and 'lspci -nn'?
Thanks.
