Many userspace applications are not prepared for suspension, like
Evolution. When suspending the machine for a long time, all IMAP
sessions are broken as their counterpart TCP sockets timeout. While
resuming, Evolution is unable to handle this condition and simply
informs the network connection has been dropped.
What about sending the SIGPWR signal to all userspace processes before
suspending so applications like Evolution can be improved to handle this
signal, drop their IMAP connections and then, when resuming, reestablish
them?
