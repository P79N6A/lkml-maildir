it was there to avoid the following situation:
on disk it's still in seconds
kernel has the inode in memory, with a recently updated times
user asks for it, gets nanoseconds data
kernel evicts inode to disk
user asks again,
kernel reads from disk (in whole seconds only on disk)
kernel reports a DIFFERENT time than it did before
user program gets confused
this actually happens, make is one of those cases that get confused for
example..
