Subject: Swsusp weirdness with ACPI

A few things to say about swsusp in 2.6.0-test5-mm1 on my Dell Smartstep
laptop.
Here is my /proc/acpi/sleep:
S0 S3 S4 S4bios S5
- 0 doesn't seem to do anything.
- 3 will ONLY 'suspend' my laptop if all my USB devices are disconnected
  and I have removed my PCMCIA cards.
  Furthermore, it won't resume. The fan will spin up, etc., but the LCD
  will not turn on.
- 4 nearly works. When it's suspending there will be an oops that flies
  by too quickly to read. It will turn off though, but when I reboot it,
  my swap partition will have been hosed:
  "Unable to find swap-space signature" when trying to swapon
  "PM: Reading swsusp image.
  swsusp: Resume From partition: hda7, Device: unknown-block(0,0)
  Resume Machine: Error -6 resuming
  PM: Resume from disk failed." when I try to resume.
  I have to mkswap it again for stuff to work.
- 4bios behaves the same way as 4.
- 5 doesn't do anything.
So overall swsusp on my laptop is fairly broken. Has anyone gotten it to
work on a similar laptop? Any possible fixes?
