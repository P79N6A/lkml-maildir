Subject: [RFC][PATCH 1/3] Create arch_gettimeoffset infrastructure for use in the generic timekeeping core.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Some arches don't supply their own clocksource. This is mainly the case
in architectures that get their inter-tick times by reading the counter
on their interval timer. Since these timers wrap every tick, they're not
really useful as clocksources. Wrapping them to act like one is possible
but not very efficient. So we provide a callout these arches  can
implement for use with the jiffies clocksource to provide finer then
tick granular time.
