ERm ... it wasn't on the systems I looked at.  CONFIG_PCI_NAMES has
clearly been set, but the names were the user-unfriendly style.  And
yet I know the kernel has them accessible, since they're presented
by the USB layer and by /proc/pci.  But not in driverfs.
I now see some code (presumably yours) to set those two fields
to be identical, in pci_scan_device(), but the useful description
is instead set in pci_scan_slot().  Presumably this is a case of
various init paths in PCI not wholly agreeing with each other;
maybe pci_name_device() should set both name/description fields
instead of only the one.  (Though ... why have two copies? :)

Good, I was just sanity checking ... since the PCI names really
haven't worked to provide user-friendly names, and I couldn't tell
if that was intentional.  I can provide a patch for USB easily.
You didn't respond to the question about changing the identifier
from "name" to be the more appropriate "description" ... is that
because you're still thinking (it'd cost to change) or because
you like using the (IMO ambiguous) identifier "name" there?
