Hmm, I'm a bit apprehensive about this approach. We are adding a lot of 
options that I'm not sure will be used. Is this needed because you added a 
ftrace printk that you want to not have the header, or because there are 
ftrace printks that exist that you want to turn on and off. Or perhaps, 
you want to see the header sometimes and sometimes you do not?
If it is the later two, then sure we could have this option. But if it is 
the former, then we probably should have another type of ftrace_printk 
that takes an option to make another event type to tell the output not to 
print?
Oh well, I have patches in mind to clean up the output code anyway.
