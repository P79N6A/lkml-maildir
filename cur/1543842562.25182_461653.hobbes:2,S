I would say (1) with slight modification
   "container will be able to touch _at least_ that number of pages"
Note that it is not only in the context of memory alone, it is generic
across resources.
For CPU it will be, "container will get _at least_ X ticks in Y seconds"
For number of tasks it will be, "container will get _at least_ X active
tasks at any point of time" and so on.
And as Dave pointed, sum of guarantees of all containers _can not_
exceed the total amount of that resource available at the system level.
