I built a new kernel today 2.6.23.1, and looked very closely at kernel 
options.
Setting:
CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB
did the trick!
hdd: TSSTcorp CDDVDW SH-S202J, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdd: selected mode 0x44
hdd: ATAPI 48X DVD-ROM DVD-R-RAM CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache, UDMA(66)
Thank you all for looking at this non-issue.  Sorry for the noise!!!
