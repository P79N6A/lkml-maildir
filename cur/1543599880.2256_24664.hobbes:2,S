SVC isn't the "Stanford Checker" that has been resulting in kernel
patches.  The name "Stanford Checker" was invented by people on LKML; the
real name of the project is Meta-level compilation, and its URL is:
http://hands.stanford.edu
SVC isn't a model checker either.  It's an implementation of cooperating
decision procedures.
