Clearly you haven't looked closely at 2.3 CD-ROM yet :)
The problem with the above patch is that it is ide-cd
specific. The code in 2.3 is heavily based on Andrew's
patch, but is not SCSI/ATAPI specific and thus work
on both equally well.
I do provide patches for 2.2 on my page, but I haven't
updated the 2.2 one in a while (i.e. it goes cleanly
on top of 2.2.12, but not 2.2.13 right now).
If there is sufficient interest I can generate a clean
patch for 2.2.13.
