Would you like it if you were that user and the kernel decided to kill
some of your processes ? I'm sure I wouldn't :)
Also, I thought the process that requests the over-the-limit memory isn't
'killed'. Surely the memory allocation routine fails. Making the user
program take action.
Then again, I'm not awake yet..
