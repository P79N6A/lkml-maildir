Way too many false positives for real usefullness. A long time ago, when
the kernel sources were much smaller, somebody ran lclint on them and got
something like 500Kb of output (I seem to remember after compression). For
code that might at that point have had a dozen or so programming errors it
would catch, not exactly cost-effective.

Yes. Now: How do you explain this "Has to happen" to the programmer and the
program in terms they both understand? If Linus says "This function must
not be called in interrupt context", or "Make sure there is no race when
updating the foo list", I'd understand; the program won't. To describe that
in some precise language might be much longer than the code so annotated.
Who then says there are no more bugs in the annotation than in the original
code?  What if I go in and change the code, but don't update the
description (because I don't understand it, or out of plain lazyness)?

Because ANSI C + gcc -Wall do most of the job anyway.
