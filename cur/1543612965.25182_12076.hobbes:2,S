Just a suggestion, if you are moving a bunch of files around, you might
e-mail Linus a small script he can cut-n-paste to move the files, and
then provide a patch for the stuff that is actually changed...  I don't
want to speak for Linus but at least for the rest of LKML it would make
the patches smaller and easier to read.  This was a pretty large patch
to the CC to lkml...
Even if the files are renamed then changed, IMHO a better submission
will include 
	mv dir1/foo.c dir2/foo.c
	mv dir1/bar.c dir2/bar.c
and then patch dir2/{foo,bar}.c....
