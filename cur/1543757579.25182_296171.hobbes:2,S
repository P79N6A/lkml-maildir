Well, I'm getting similar stack traces with my system and those are sure
scary, but it seems that my e-mails to the list are simply ignored,
unfortunately.
I am willing to test any patch and configuration (let's call me a "guinea
pig"), but I don't know what I should do. I have, OTOH, reported my problem
many times in the past few days. :-(
I will retry sending my message to the list once again, with the details
(in my case, the message I get is "irq 10: nobody cared!" and it is
regarding my primary HD on my secondary Promise PDC20265 controller).
Thanks for any help, Rogério.
P.S.: I have already bought an 80-pin cable just for this drive in the hope
that the message would go away, but it didn't.
