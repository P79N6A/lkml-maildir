The numa output uses only one loop and so I think we could do the same 
here. Its good to have the global number first that way existing tools can 
simply read a number and get what they intuitively expect.

Yes we must do so because support for 4k processors etc is on the horizon.

Hmmm.. We are thinking about freeing percpu areas when a cpu goes offline. 
So we would need to fold statistics into another cpu if this is a cocnern.
