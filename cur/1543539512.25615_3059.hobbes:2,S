If you only update from the current task then you only have one writer
(like most of the fields in struct task) so you do not need a lock.  If
you update from other tasks then you need a lock to prevent concurrent
updates.  SIGSTOP only prevents the current task from reading the mask
while it is being updatad, it does not prevent concurrent updates.
I think Linda needs to define exactly the read and write constraints on
this field, how many writers, how many readers, size of field, if multi
word can some words be updated without others etc.  This question is
getting too many "if this then that" responses.
