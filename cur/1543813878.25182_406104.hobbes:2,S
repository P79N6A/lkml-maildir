Yes, I have a similar patch for i386 in the kernel. I don't yet have 
modifications for opcontrol or ophelp.
One question would be identifying the processor when using the perfmon2 
support for i386/* processors? There is prior support in the oprofile 
driver for i386 processors. Identify the processor differently depending 
on whether perfmon2 is being used to distinguish between the different 
interfaces? The way that OProfile has the events each name processor 
requires a different directory in /usr/share/oprofile. Would prefer to 
keep down the proliferation of new directories.
