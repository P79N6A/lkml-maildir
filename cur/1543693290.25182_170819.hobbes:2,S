My guess is that those 24 dentries are just noise. What we should
do is verify with a large number of devices if the numbers are all
that different after a walk of the sysfs tree.

Assuming that unused files/dirs are aged out of dentry and inode cache,
it should benefit. The numbers you should look at are -
--------------------------------------------------------
After mounting sysfs
-------------------
dentry_cache (active)           2350                    1321
inode_cache (active)            1058                    31
LowFree                         875096 KB               875836 KB
--------------------------------------------------------
That saves ~800KB. If you just mount sysfs and use a few files, you
aren't eating up dentries and inodes for every file in sysfs. How often 
do you expect hotplug events to happen in a system ? Some time after a 
hotplug event, dentries/inodes will get aged out and then you should see 
savings. It should greatly benefit in a normal system.
Now if the additional kobjects cause problems with userland hotplug, then 
that needs to be resolved. However that seems to be a different problem 
altogether. Could you please elaborate on that ?
Thanks
