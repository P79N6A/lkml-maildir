   Sometimes I get ping times of up to 20 seconds(!) while normaly
   ping times are ~0.3ms.  If this happens I have to reboot either my
   server or my client.
   What can I do to debug this if it happens again?
Let me guess, you see this behavior on systems where DHCP is running
in some way?  And it happens about when a client rebinds, and the
machine in question is going ARP crazy if you watch it on the network
with tcpdump?
Did I guess right?
