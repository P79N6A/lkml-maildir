I have the same problem.  However the lockup most often occurs after
switching with Ctrl+Alt+Fx from plain text console to X.  PS/2 mouse +
keyboard, gpm running.

I had this problem for quite some time with 2.2.x and 2.4.x kernels,
XFree86 3.3.x -- 4.1.0 and S3 Trio3D / NVidia TNT2 M64 / NVidia
GeForce2.  Lockups with S3 convice me that NVidia module is probably
irrelevant here.

I've found out that ssh'ing to the host and running chvt 1 (as root)
helps.  Switching back to X usually works fine.
I haven't tried monitoring /proc/interrupts, but even the magic SysRq
doesn't work during the lock-up.
P.S. I'm not subscribed to linux-kernel.
