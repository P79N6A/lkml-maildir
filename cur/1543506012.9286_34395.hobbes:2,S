I just installed linux kernel 2.2.11 under redhat v6.0.  When I got it 
installed, and rebooted, I could not start nfs, specifically rpc.nfsd.  
It gives me the following mesage:
 nrssvc: function not implemented
I did not get this message under the 2.2.5-15 kernel.  Any help 
would be greatly appreciated.
