Which of those options apply to the SC1200 version of the geode and does
it use the same ide controller driver as the cs55x0 you had in your
previous patch?
There are starting to be too many geode's.  It's almost as confusing as
keeping track of Pentium models.
I currently build a 486 kernel for use on the sc1200 and it seems to run
pretty good that way.
