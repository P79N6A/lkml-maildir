The problem with cpufreq was that it used lock_cpu_hotplug() 
in some common routines because it
was needed in some paths and then also called the same routines
from the CPU hotplug callback path. That is easily fixable and
Gautham's patch 1/4 does exactly that.
One thing I have privately suggested to Gautham is to do an audit
of bad lock_cpu_hotplug() uses.
Now coming to the read-side of lock_cpu_hotplug() - cpu hotplug
is a very special asynchronous event. You cannot protect against
it using your own subsystem lock because you don't control
access to cpu_online_map. With multiple low-level subsystems
needing it, it also becomes difficult to work out the lock
hierarchies. The right way to do this is what Gautham and Ingo
are discussing - a scalable rw semaphore type lock that allows
recursive readers.

I don't think that is a good idea. The right thing to do would be to
do an audit and clean up the bad lock_cpu_hotplug() calls. People
seem to have just got lazy with lock_cpu_hotplug().
