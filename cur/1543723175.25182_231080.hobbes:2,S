Dave enabled the receive buffer auto-tuning which uses TCP window
scaling.  It looks like all these sites are running FreeBSD, perhaps
there is a bug in FreeBSD?
As suggested earlier please get a TCP dump of a failed connection.
To turn of receive buffer auto-tuning:
	sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_moderate_rcvbuf=0
	sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_default_win_scale=0
Thanks.
