One box, tux06, has the latest Dell BIOS, A05. I don't know how to 
determine if it has the latest microcode updates. Where can one get the 
current microcode updates, and how do I install it?

According to cat /proc/cpuinfo, two boxes tux06 & tux34 have stepping 
10, and tux47 has stepping 2. I have seen the unexplained "Illegal 
instruction" messages on tux34 and tux47, but I haven't run the modified 
kernel on them. root access is restricted here.
