I'm attempting to add ps-like code to an application, and am running into
a problem calculating the memory usage of multithreaded processes.  The
memory usage numbers in /proc/PID/statm don't give any indication as to
whether or not the process shares its VM with another, thus a
multithreaded application appears to be using (actual usage * number of
threads).
It looks like this could be easilly solved by looking at Tgid in
/proc/PID/status and calculating memory usage per-thread-group instead of
per-process.  The problem, however, is that glibc 2.2.5 does not set
CLONE_THREAD and so Tgid == Pid in every case.
Would it break anything if I patch my glibc to set this flag?  Is
task_struct->tgid just informational in 2.4, or does it modify the
behavior of the task somehow?
Or, is there perhaps another way to see if CLONE_VM was set when the
process was cloned?  (Thus avoiding the need to change anything in glibc.)
Upgrading to 2.5 and using NGPT is not an option at this point.
Other suggestions?
