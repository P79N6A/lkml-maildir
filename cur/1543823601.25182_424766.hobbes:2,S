Hi,
A colleague at work pointed me to a 10 year old paper OSDI paper called Lazy
Receiver Processing (See 
http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/Systems/LRP/
). The work
appears similar to what Van Jacobson is proposing in his paper. The
emphasis is more on fair resource allocation but the core ideas seems
similar. The implementation is not on Linux (it's on 4.4 BSD) but the paper
is worth checking out.
