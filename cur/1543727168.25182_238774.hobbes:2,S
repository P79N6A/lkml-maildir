I have a series of 3 patches in my stack that applies on existing
3 RCU patches in -mm2 -
rcu-code-cleanup : Major cleanup removing per_cpu() calculations and use				pointers to RCU global and per-cpu data.
call-rcu-bh : Introduce call_rcu_bh() for faster grace periods with
		softirq-only code.
use-call-rcu-bh : use call_rcu_bh in ipv4 route cache. This helps avoid
  			dst cache overflows during DoS testing [as
			explained in my OLS presentation ]
It will be easier to stick the two patches from Paul on top of these,
so I will merge these with my patchset and send the entire set
of 5 patches for -mm testing.
Thanks
Dipankar
