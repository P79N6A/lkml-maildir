There are patches floating around for a UML frame buffer device.
Gerd Kraxel^H^H^H^H^H^HHoffmann did one using plain X11, which worked
great when I gave it a try.
A few years ago I tried doing one myself using gdk/gtk, but it didn't
work reliably on all systems. My main motivation was doing development for
different frame buffer memory organizations (think Amiga and Atari bitplanes)
on UML.
I suggest taking a look at Gerd's patches. IIRC, he posted them to lkml
last year.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
