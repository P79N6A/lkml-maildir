I'm trying to get involved in kernel development, starting with 2.6 
modules.  i found some great stuff for 2.4, which had 'hello world' 
modules, but they're not compiling in 2.6
could anyone point me in the right direction for some online beginner's 
docs for 2.6 kernel & module programming?  I've ordered the book 
previously mentioned here, but am eager to get started.
thanks in advance,
- Blake
