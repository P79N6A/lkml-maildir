	Actually, the customer really only cares about payload. And if the overhead 
is a constant ratio to the data, just adjust the rate and it all comes out in 
the wash. The only reason to care is if you want to play games, such as 
saying you charge the same rate 'per byte' as another provider when you 
really don't.

	No is there any need to. Do you really need to differentially account for 
customers who have more 'overhead bytes per data byte' than others? Or can 
you just say it's 12% and raise/lower your rates 12%

	But accounting for the retransmissions won't help you, because you can't 
tell retransmissions that the customer should rightly pay for versus 
retransmissions that he shouldn't. So again, you can't do any better than to 
just work it into the base price.

	I realize that, but I don't see what good it is. So yes, it's something 
that's currently hard to do, but if there's no legitimate need, then it 
doesn't matter whether it's hard or not. You pose problems and you pose a 
solution, but unless you can show that the solution actually solves the 
problem, the solution is of no value.

	Well, show them a real-world problem that it solves. Show a case where you 
can't bill fairly without it and you can bill fairly with it. ... If you can.
