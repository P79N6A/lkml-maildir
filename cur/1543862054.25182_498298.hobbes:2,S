Subject: [PATCH 2/5] KVM: Fix race between mmio reads and injected interrupts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/11/53

The kvm mmio read path looks like:
 1. guest read faults
 2. kvm emulates read, calls emulator_read_emulated()
 3. fails as a read requires userspace help
 4. exit to userspace
 5. userspace emulates read, kvm sets vcpu->mmio_read_completed
 6. re-enter guest, fault again
 7. kvm emulates read, calls emulator_read_emulated()
 8. succeeds as vcpu->mmio_read_emulated is set
 9. instruction completes and guest is resumed
A problem surfaces if the userspace exit (step 5) also requests an interrupt
injection.  In that case, the guest does not re-execute the original
instruction, but the interrupt handler.  The next time an mmio read is
exectued (likely for a different address), step 3 will find
vcpu->mmio_read_completed set and return the value read for the original
instruction.
The problem manifested itself in a few annoying ways:
- little squares appear randomly on console when switching virtual terminals
- ne2000 fails under nfs read load
- rtl8139 complains about "pci errors" even though the device model is
  incapable of issuing them.
Fix by skipping interrupt injection if an mmio read is pending.
A better fix is to avoid re-entry into the guest, and re-emulating immediately
instead.  However that's a bit more complex.
