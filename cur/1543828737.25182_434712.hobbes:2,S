Not if it's an ISA card.  You need to loop over all interrupt source
devices until you're certain that they have released the interrupt
line before returning, otherwise you will end up with the IRQ line
stuck in a state where it can't cause any further interrupts.
The kernel has no such infrastructure, except within the serial driver
to allow multiple serial ports to share a common interrupt.
