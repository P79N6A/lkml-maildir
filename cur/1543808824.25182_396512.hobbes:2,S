Not that it explains your problem in permissive mode, but note that
reiserfs and selinux aren't going to work together very well in
enforcing mode due to the atomic inode security labeling patches that
went into 2.6.14.  ext2, ext3, tmpfs, jfs, and (recently) xfs have been
converted to call the security_inode_init_security hook and set security
attributes for new inodes.
