Thanks for cc'ing me (I'm still on holiday and not following the
mailing list). The problem is the __builtin_constant_p gcc function
which doesn't work properly with 4.x versions. It was fixed in latest
gcc versions though. Kmemleak relies on __builtin_constant_p to
determine the pointer aliases and without it you would get plenty of
false positives.
