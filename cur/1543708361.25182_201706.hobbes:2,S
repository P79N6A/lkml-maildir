Hi,
I reported the same problem some time ago. Could you type
grep cpu /proc/stat; cat /proc/uptime
for example, I get
cpu  140708 1489 43735 21209021 292168 4879 4192
cpu0 140708 1489 43735 21209021 292168 4879 4192
216925.15 215037.34
Then add jiffies and divide by uptime:
(140708+1489+43735+21209021+292168+4879+4192)/216925.15 = 100.01695
which is not 100 here as it should be. (On kernel 2.2.* I have it exactly
100). ps uses Hertz=100 but it should be 170 ppm larger which makes an error
of about 15 seconds a day. (Running without ntpd doesn't fix it.)
