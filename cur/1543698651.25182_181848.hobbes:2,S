But it does - you have to include the Linux header files in order to be
able to make any nontrivial module.
I'm not claiming that "thinking about Linux makes you tainted". It's not
about inspiration. But it's a bit like getting somebody pregnant: you have
to do a lot more than just think about it to actually make it happen, or
every high school in the world would be crawling with babies.
In other words: feel free to be inspired by Linux all you want. But if you
release a binary module that loads and works, you've been doing more than
just feeling inspired. And then you need to be _careful_.
