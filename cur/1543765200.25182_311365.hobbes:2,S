Please don't send libata stuff directly to Linus.
Even a patch that appears as simple as this has complications:
The Intel ICH7 combined mode still needs sorting out; combined mode and
another BIOS option (IDE/AHCI) can change the PCI IDs that the
southbridge exports.
I don't want to commit support for -half- the configurations, which
oh-by-the-way will fail if even those users tweak the BIOS options.
