I could imagine something like this.
There are some special folders or files or whatever under every file
where some userspace can put some metadata. A keyword perhaps.
echo linux > file.bla/keywords/topic
The filesystem might then automatically put these keywords into an index
and then provide a search mechanism elsewhere where it could ask "find
me all dentries with the keyword 'linux'." and it would return a list
like locate does. Only that it's in realtime and also works when moving
the file around (but not when copying with an unaware program for
obvious reasons).
