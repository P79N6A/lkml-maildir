Subject: [PATCH] DVB: Clarify description text for dvb-bt8xx in Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/17/157

Sorry for sending this twice... The first time I cc'd the wrong email 
address for LKML...
Patrick Keene wrote to the linux-dvb list, asking where in menuconfig he 
can enable dvb-bt8xx for his AVerMedia DVB card.  I pointed the 
following out to him:
config DVB_BT8XX
       tristate "Nebula/Pinnacle PCTV/Twinhan PCI cards"
It has been agreed upon that this description is extremely misleading.
This patch changes the one-liner description text of dvb-bt8xx to 
something more meaningful, and adds AVerMedia to the detailed description.
