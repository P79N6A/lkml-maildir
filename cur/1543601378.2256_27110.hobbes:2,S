Sorry I thought you had been staring at the problem long enough to
see.  In any case the problem with the current code is that you can't
put all pages in the swap cache immediately because you don't want to
allocate the swap space just yet.  And without being in the swap cache
aging isn't especially effective.
By using something like a shared memory segment behind every anonymous
page, you can put the page in the swap cache before you allocate swap
for it (because it has a persistent identity).   Further since you no
longer need counts for every swap page.  You can deallocate swap space
from pages simply by walking through the ``indirect pages'' and
removing the reference to swap space.

I think I can I haven't had time to implement it.  Given the way Alan
and some of the others were talking I though my idea has long ago been
thought of and put on the plate for 2.5.  If it really is a new idea
under the sun I'll look at implementing it as soon as I have a hole
in my schedule.
