realistically NPTL on 2.4 is a real big pain in the <>. So I would
suggest to either use a distribution kernel with NPTL patched in, or use
a 2.6 kernel. Making your own NPTL patch for 2.4.. lets say it would
take a really really experienced kernel hacker at least 3 weeks... and
stability would be.. brittle. Just don't go there ;(
