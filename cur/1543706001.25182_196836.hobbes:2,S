Hi all,
 Where i was using the 2.4.x kernel my multimedia keyboard was sending the
 special keys to usermode apps, allowing to control them and assign some
 functions.
 Now i'm on 2.6.2 and some of these keys are not working... no scancode,
 nothing, either looking with dmesg or xev.
 It's like the kernel is "filtering" the unknown scancodes and delete them.
 Ideas?
 Thanks anyway.
 p.s.: the 2.4 kernel i was using was a standard bareacpi.i from SlackWare
 9.1, while the config for 2.6 was strongly edited. However i didn't see any
 option for keyboards, so i don't think it's a config fault.
 p.p.s.: sorry for bad english :P
