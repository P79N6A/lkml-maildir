I'm not skilled enough to write even simple C or PERL programs, but maybe
I could try improving linux kernel documentation. Not sure about the
procedure to take nor the available time I'll have. But I'm willing to
help where I can.
Would be nice to know whether there is some sense in documenting the whole
/proc, just the part of ot that will stay in 2.5.x or continue with what
we have rught now.
I'll check the mentioned program to see if there is the information I
need. Stay tuned :)
Regards.
