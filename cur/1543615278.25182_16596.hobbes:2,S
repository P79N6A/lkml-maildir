	That's why you should never, ever do anything that stupid. What should the 
kernel do? When it sees the first write, it has no idea there's going to be a 
second write, so it sends a packet. It gives you the benefit of the doubt and 
assumes that you know how to use TCP. When it sees the second write 
immediately thereafter and they're both small, it no longer trusts you and it 
has no idea there isn't going to be a third write a microsecond later, so it 
doesn't send a packet.

	If you can design an algorithm that makes that only two times slower, then 
the world will be excited and interested and perhaps that algorithm will 
replace TCP. But until that time, we're stuck with what we have.

	THAT IS THE POINT. The problem wasn't in the kernel, it was in the program, 
and you fixed it. If you do smart buffering, TCP can behave efficiently. If 
you don't, it has to guess when to send packets, and it can't possibly 
predict the future and behave in the way you think is optimum.
	How does it know you care about latency rather than throughput? And what 
should it do if it sees a steady stream of one byte writes, one every tenth 
of a second?
