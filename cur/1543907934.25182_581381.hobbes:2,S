No. As update_curr_rt() suggests it's only about collecting runtime
statistics, namely
(a) the longest interval of time a given task was consuming a CPU
(i.e. == 'current') and
(b) the total amount of time it was running.
To this goal, it would be enough to call it only in
put_prev_task_rt().. I recall, we do it in dequeue_task_rt() to catch
a case of SCHED_RR/FIFO --> SCHED_NORMAL transition (e.g. in
sched_setscheduler()).. so that may make accounting a bit less precise
for (a).
