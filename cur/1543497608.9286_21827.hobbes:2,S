LAN CRC's aren't sufficient. They protect card->card not host->host. And
the world _does_ see host->host errors. Also IP checksums are cheap, even
in silicon

It would make no difference. The cost nowdays is the cost per packet big time.
Going to bigger packets is a huge win. The checksum helps but not that much.
There are also people researching using FPGA's to do hardware assisted 
IP handling (eg hardware TCP demux)
