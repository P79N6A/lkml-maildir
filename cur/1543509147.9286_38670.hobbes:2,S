     I asked the other day about rpc.rstatd for 2.2.x as 3.03 no longer worked
right with the changes made to /proc layout (additional fields, per CPU info on
SMP systems, etc). 
     I was unable to find a newer version on the net, so I hacked up 3.03 and
called it 3.03b.  It now works on 2.2.x, SMP and UP systems, but is not
backward compatible to 2.0.x. 
     It is available on 
ftp://ftp.eskimo.com/pub/linux
 for anybody else who
might be in the same boat.
