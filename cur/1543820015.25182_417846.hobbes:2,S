Andrew Morton just submitted a patch to -mm that fixes the two problem
places that called kfree(NULL) more than it calls kfree(non-NULL).
Besides the places that are now fixed, the inline doesn't save much.
Since most cases kfree(non-NULL) is called, so the NULL is really an
unlikely case.  Thus you just increased the size of the kernel, for
virtually no speed savings.
