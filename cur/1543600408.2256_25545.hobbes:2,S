If it's looped, i.e. the remote end is plugged in my own port, its address is
local, isn't it?
In any case, such a serial line, or an Ethernet cable

It's not a peculiarity, it's a regular case.
127.0.0.0/8 is a local network.
If the other entry in the local routing table says `192.168.1.217/32',
it just happens to be /32, not any other prefix length.
And what should I patch?  Postfix?

[snip]
If the application doesn't know which address to bind to, or it doesn't
matter, it uses INADDR_ANY.
If it matters, user specifies one.
Application may also use the same address as the address of incoming TCP
connection.  That's fine.
For really odd cases, like with routing daemons, application has knowledge
about the routing or may bind to interface (not address), but it's not for
regular use.
