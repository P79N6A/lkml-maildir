Interesting point. I sure agree it's saner to have the flush_tlb in
between ptep_get_and_clear and set_pte, I said the other version just
because I'm thinking hardware TLB and it shouldn't make any difference
on hardware TLB anyways, does it?

I'm not very fond on software TLBs and their internal locking, but
exactly because of what you said ("they grab the page_table_lock."), how
can the software TLB ever care about the flush_tlb in between
ptep_get_and_clear and set_pte?
ptep_establish is obviously always called with the page_table_lock hold.
Nobody is allowed to call ptep_establish without it. So a larger code
sequence of my version expands to:
	spin_lock(&page_table_lock)
	ptep_establish() {
		ptep_get_and_clear
		set_pte
		flush_tlb
	}
	spin_unlock(&page_table_lock)
How can a software TLB care about a tlb flush in between two pieces of
code that are anyways under the page_table_lock?
