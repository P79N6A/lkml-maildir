Well, the _common_ case at least for the loader is that the "top of the 
hole" is actually the stack. So the above would _really_ suck, and crash 
pretty much immediately ;)
It would also cause the strange behaviour that we'd start allocating the 
virtual memory areas in "reverse order", ie we'd start at the top and grow 
down.
So I don't think that's a very good approach.
This is why special cases get complex: they end up feeding yet more 
special cases.
