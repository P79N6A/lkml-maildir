Yes, I think so.

The whole purpose of the hrwng subsystem is to give userspace
an interface to the RNG device. Not more and not less.
So, if you have a special hwrng on your embedded board and you
have some special driver in that board, why not interface
directly from the driver to the hwrng-driver?
This is all pretty special case.
In the hwrng-driver you could still additionally do a
hrwng_register() to export the functionality to
userspace, though.
I am not a friend of a direct in-kernel hwrng access interface,
because it may return crap data by definition. Many (all current)
RNG devices may fail and return non-random data. If that's happily
used by some in-kernel user by the interface, we are screwed.
Why can't you build your random-data consumer as module and load
it later, when random data is available (and was carefully checked
by various tests in rngd)?
