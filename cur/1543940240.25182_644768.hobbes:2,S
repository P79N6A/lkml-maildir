what's your point ?  LTP scripts are POSIX compliant with a little extra that 
so far has worked fine for everyone actually running LTP.  as soon as the 
little extra realistically becomes a problem, i'll rework things.  you havent 
shown a realistic system.  i'm willing to tweak things for real LTP users, 
not people being tools.

no.  people run LTP on embedded systems w/out bash.
