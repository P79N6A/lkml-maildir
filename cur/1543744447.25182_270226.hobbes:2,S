we had most of this in the tracer already, just obscured a bit.
In the current tree i've separated all the functionality into the
following flags: trace_enabled, trace_user_triggered, trace_freerunning.
When user_triggered is enabled all the other timing related tracing
activities stops (wakeup & critical/irq timing), and userspace is the
master of when tracing starts and stops. The way to turn the tracer
on/off is still the gettimeofday API hack:
	gettimeofday(0,1);
	gettimeofday(0,0);
i enhanced this user-defined tracing with a timing mechanism: the kernel
measures the latency between on and off and does the usual max-latency
or threshold tracking and saves the latency trace into
/proc/latency_trace only if the latency condition triggers. So userspace 
only has to add the start/stop hooks and the kernel will deal with the 
rest.
the freerunning flag can be used to generate traces where there's no
natural 'start' event, only some well-defined "we have a latency
problem" point. The application can start tracing at startup (or you can
start it via a different app), and it's enough to stop tracing when
there's a problem - the last ~4000 trace entries will be copied into
/proc/latency_trace. (the timing mechanism is still present in this mode
as well.)
(Freerunning mode can also be used if for some reason the delays are too
long to be fully traced and if the 'interesting' stuff is at the end of
the delay.)
This stuff will show up in the next release, later today. It should
cover the needs that your tests have at the moment, correct?
