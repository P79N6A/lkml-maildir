First, how does this work in-kernel? Does it set a flag in the thread
struct that magically gets used in the actual syscall? Or do we pass
flags down to the sys_foo() function in some manner?
If the former, there is potential for interaction with asynchronous
code running on behalf of the thread, no? Especially if we ever adopt
one of the syslet schemes.
Second, I think we're likely to run out of flag bits really quickly as
this is a good dumping spot for patching up our many slightly
brain-damaged APIs (be they POSIX or Linux-specific).
Third, can I do sys_indirect(sys_indirect(foo, args), flags1),
flags2)?
Fourth, can we do sys_indirect(foo, args, flags | ASYNC) and get most
of the way to merging this with the syslet proposal?
