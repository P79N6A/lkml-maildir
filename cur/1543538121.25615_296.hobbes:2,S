neither of these numbers are germane. the problem is not how rapidly
an interrupt handler runs (though this is important). what matters in
this context is how fast a thread thats been marked runnable (and whose
scheduling class and priority require that it be given the processor
ASAP) has to wait after the end of the interrupt before it is running
again.

I don't know whether they have gotten worse or better. It wouldn't
suprise me if they've never been that good. Linus says that latency
has always been a concern of his, and its possible that for the main
kernel code, this is reflected, but that various device drivers and
changes to them over time don't show the same care. Its also possible
(i might even guess likely) that most kernel developers rarely if ever
run applications that require this kind of behaviour, and so the
kernel has possibly never had much better performance than it does
now.
Benno has done measurements on the 2.2->2.4 transition, but as he has
commented, the situation with the VM system makes it unwise to read
too much into the numbers at this time.
The "factors" mentioned above are based on the results of people on
non-Linux audio mailing lists who work like mad to get the best
results from Windows and MacOS, as well as other sources for other
OS's. Solaris is the only one I am not really sure about relative to
Linux, but some people have told me that its much better.
