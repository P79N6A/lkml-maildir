Hullo...
This is my first post in the Big Playground, so be gentle with me =) I'm 
following up from the thread earlier this month ( 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0404.0/0927.html
 ) to basically  
say "me too".
I'm using Debian's 2.6.5 kernel-source and I have a 3c905C thusly:

This is a recent Gigabyte-brand P3 motherboard using the APIC, and IRQ11 is 
being shared between the 3Com and the onboard Realtek 8139.
(I/O APIC #2 Version 17 at 0xFEC00000.
Enabling APIC mode:  Flat.  Using 1 I/O APICs)
Everything ran at full speed on my previous 2.4.23 (this is my first adventure 
into 2.6), but TX out of the 3Com is running at a maximum of 200kbit/sec... I 
never guessed my WAN connection would ever be faster than my LAN one!
Interestingly, RX on the 3Com is seemingly unaffected - I got 10Mbit on an FTP 
test (I'm guessing the slower-than-usual response is due to the low TX speed 
causing latency on the ACKs)
The other thing I've noticed is the card does not now respond to probing with 
'mii-tool' which it always did previously, so I have no way to get / set the 
half/full duplex settings.
eddie:~# mii-tool  eth0
SIOCGMIIPHY on 'eth0' failed: Operation not supported
Any advice / suggestions warmly welcomed :)
Cheers,
Gavin.
