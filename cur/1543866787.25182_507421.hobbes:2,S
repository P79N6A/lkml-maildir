Hi,
Something unrelated to the tests I am doing.
I found out that the libsata driver doesn't really cope or likes the
idea that you might have a controller without a master drive
configured.
In this case on ATA2 I have a CDROM drive, connected as slave.
ATA: abnormal status 0x7F on port 0x177
ATA: abnormal status 0x7F on port 0x177
ata2.01: ATAPI, max UDMA/66
ata2.01: configured for UDMA/66
And in another case, I have ATA5 with no drives connected at all:
pata_pdc2027x 0000:00:0f.0: PLL input clock 33508 kHz
ata5: PATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xF88597C0 ctl 0xF8859FDA bmdma 0xF8859000 irq 19
ata6: PATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xF88595C0 ctl 0xF8859DDA bmdma 0xF8859008 irq 19
scsi4 : pata_pdc2027x
ATA: abnormal status 0x8 on port 0xF88597DF
Maybe this is purely a cosmetic error where the error code can be
translated to something like "no drive attached" or maybe the drivers
assume you always configure a master drive on a controller, which
doesnt always have to be the case, especialy not with motherboards
these days where you get 2 ATA ports + 2 exta raid channels.
