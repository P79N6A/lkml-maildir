The problem is still there in 2.4.13-ac5 and 2.4.13-ac7, with the same
symptom:
Nov  3 15:46:27 bertha 3dmd: ioctl(4) failed: No such device or address
Nov  3 15:46:27 bertha 3dm: 3dmd startup succeeded 
Although the web interface to 3dmd doesn't appear to find the controller,
everything else appears to work just fine.
Plain 2.4.13 (and earlier, at least 2.4.10 and 2.4.12) appear to be OK.
I'm running the 7.3.2 release of the firmware (7.3.2 FE7X 1.03.09.027) and
3dmd (1.10.00.020), and using the driver included with the kernel
releases. Interesting features: Escalade 7810 with 8 drives, dual processor
Athlon MP on a Tyan Tiger mb, Netgear GA620.
