I've worked with several different varieties of Winmodem, and of all of them,
the Motorola SM56 seems to suck most (or, at least it's driver does).  Do
anything that will be tying the machine up for a little while - compiling,
rendering a large page in Netscape, etc., and presto, a line drop.
On an unrelated note, and further off-topic - does anyone know of a modem that
will *currently* work with Linux, and which returns 'RING' or 'RINGING' when
the other end is ringing (and ATX4 or similar is selected)?  It's a bit of an
unusual requirement, I realise, and seems to be something modem manufacturers
have silently stopped doing.  I'm on the list, but I think replies would be
better directed straight to me.
