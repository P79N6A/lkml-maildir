Also being investigated. Actually, I prefer the idea of switching our fieldbus
to ARCnet - which can handle IP traffic as well as the low-level stuff. You can
get a chip with an 8051 core and an ARCnet core next to each other, which is
quite nice.

I fully intend to support 'decent' fast serial ports, running RS485 up to 
1.5Mbaud, but I may have to build such boards myself - and if I want 
widespread testing of my Profibus code, there's no substitute for commodity 
hardware.

It's not that it's not reliable in software - it's just that we might not be 
able to pass the certification in software - that's a different thing.
With a little care (and hdparm -u) we can get it to be _reliable_ without too
much trouble - this is Linux, after all.
