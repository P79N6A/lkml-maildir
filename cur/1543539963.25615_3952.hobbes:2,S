Some guys a work want to use a 900 Mhz Athlon with 1.5 gig of ram for
some chip design tools.  We're running redhat 6.2 (2.2pl15).
I never paid much attention to talk about such a powerful systems since
I never used one until now ;-)
When it had 3 256mbyte modules, I ran lmbench, and it paniced the
machine (3 times running).
We replaced the 256 mbyte ram with 512 mbyte modules (so the machine
had 1.5 mbyte -- we had to trade with someone else).
The bios seems to have a bug...it can't detect 512m modules (so it
sees "768M".)
I did a boot with
	mem=1200m
to see what would happen...the kernel paniced.
I did a boot with
       mem=200m
and ran lmbench successfully...
Was there anything moving from 2.2pl15 to 2.4 which would effect how this works?
Its "new hardware" (which AMD loaned us).  Would it be useful to run a
quick&dirty ram tester on there?
I'm not convinced the hardware is necessarily good (we're giving it a workout
with NT to see what happens).
Any comments/suggestions?  I'm  thinking of building 2.4-test4 and see 
where it gets us.
