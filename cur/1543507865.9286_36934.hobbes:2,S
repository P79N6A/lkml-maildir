Hello guys,
I am using mount(2) system call to mount MO drives. Depending on previous
situation,
/var/log/messages is reporting that the media being mounted was not unmounted
properly or requires a e2fsck as exceeding # of mounts.
Question: How can I get such status after mount(2) is completed ? In that case I
will umount(2) the media, initiates a system(2) with e2fsck and mounting again.

I am looking for a documentation describing /etc/conf.modules and mkinitrd.
For example, I want to have a module loaded during boottime but without the
autoclean flag. Currently I use insmod command in the /etc/rc.d/rc.local but
I am quite sure there is a more professional way.
------
Thanks is advance
