Subject: [PATCH] Fix binfmt_elf.c bug on ppc64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi!
Any prelinked shared library is impossible to run on ppc64 without this
patch, as they immediately segfault. Say:
/bin/echo
works even if /lib64/ld64.so.1 is prelinked while
/lib64/ld64.so.1 /bin/echo
segfaults.
The problem is that ELF_PLAT_INIT is passed the virtual address of the
shared library, not the difference between the virtual address of the shared
library and p_vaddr of the first PT_LOAD segment in that library
(while for the interpreter interp_load_address is the bias).
ELF_PLAT_INIT sets gpr[2] to this absolute address, but
arch/ppc64/kernel/process.c (start_thread) assumes it is a bias and adds it
to entry and toc values loaded from the entry point descriptor.
For non-prelinked shared libraries, first PT_LOAD segment's p_vaddr is
typically 0 and thus load_addr == load_bias (which is why this bug has not
been discovered that long).
