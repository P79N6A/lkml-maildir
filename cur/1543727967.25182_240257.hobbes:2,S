SHA is not going to be faster than the cut-down MD4 --- and you can't
use a pure random sequence number for the initial TCP sequence number,
lest a packet from a previous TCP connection get mistaken as belong to
the newly created TCP stream.  See Bellovin's recommendations for
secure TCP sequnce number genreation for a discussion of the
constraints.

The Yarrow-type PRNG suffers from the problem that the entropy pool is
pathetically small.  It fundamentally assumes that the crypto checksum
is secure, and it is really much more of a *P*RNG than anything else.
The scheme used in the current /dev/random design is much closer to
that used by GPG, and relies on a large pool so that we can collect as
much entropy as possible from the hardware sources available to the
kernel.  I'm not familiar with the Fortuna PRNG that you're going to
propose, but my guess is that it will have a similar, much heavier
dependence on the crypto algorithms in terms of its assumptions.
