Caused by Alan's "PM: make wakeup flags available whenever CONFIG_PM is
set" which I assume Len merged.
Sorry, but that code should be dragged out and shot.  Doing this:
> 	device_can_wakeup(tty_dev) = 1;
is just gross and stupid.  It looks daft, it isn't C and it *requires* that
device_can_wakeup() be implemented as a macro, which totally busts any
concept of abstraction.
The code previously had quite reasonable accessors:
 #define device_set_wakeup_enable(dev,val) \
        ((dev)->power.should_wakeup = !!(val))
 #define device_may_wakeup(dev) \
        (device_can_wakeup(dev) && (dev)->power.should_wakeup)
can we please go back to that scheme?  Please also convert all these
magical macros into inlined C functions.  One reason is that this:
+#define device_init_wakeup(dev,val) \
+       do { \
+               device_can_wakeup(dev) = !!(val); \
+               device_set_wakeup_enable(dev,val); \
+       } while(0)
is buggy.  It evaluates its arguments multiple times and will cause
failures when passed expressions which have side-effects.
Alan, please also pass all future patches through checkpatch - there is no
need to be adding trivial coding-style errors in this day and age.
Thanks.
