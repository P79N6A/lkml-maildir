Roland Dreier got this right.  The purpose of the mmiowb is
to ensure that writes to I/O devices while holding a spinlock
are ordered with respect to writes issued after the original
processor releases and a second processor acquires said
spinlock.
A MMIO read would be sufficient, but is much heavier weight.
On the SGI MIPS-based systems, the "sync" instruction was used.
On the Altix systems, a register on the hub chip is read.
From comments by jejb, we're looking at modifying the mmiowb
API by adding an argument which would be a register to read
from if the architecture in question needs ordering in this
way but does not have a lighter weight mechanism like the Altix
mmiowb.  Since there will now need to be a width indication,
mmiowb will be replaced with mmiowb[bwlq].
