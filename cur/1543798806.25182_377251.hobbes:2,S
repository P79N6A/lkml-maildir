My patch reduces it from roughly 6kB to 4kB.
I'm with you that we need a safety net, but I don't see a problem with 
this being between 3kB and 4kB. The goal should be to _never_ use more 
than 3kB stack having a 1kB safety net.
And in my experience, many stack problems don't come from code getting 
more complex but from people allocating 1kB structs or arrays of
> 2k chars on the stack. In these cases, the code has to be fixed and 
"make checkstack" makes it easy to find such cases.
And as a data point, my count of bug reports for problems with in-kernel 
code with 4k stacks after Neil's patch went into -mm is still at 0.

Unfortunately, "is not really something to encourage" doesn'a make 
"happens in real-life applications" impossible...
Reducing the stack by one third brings a factor two reduction in the 
memory usage of threads - I wouldn't say this sounds too bad.
