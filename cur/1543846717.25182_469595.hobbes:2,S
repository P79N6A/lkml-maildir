You can _add_ to the userspace API, because that obviously does not 
break old programs.
You just should not introduce changes which break old programs.
Binaries built in the 1990's still work under Linux, you know...
API changes require new ioctl/sub-ioctl numbers, so that new programs 
can take advantage of new capabilities while old programs continue to work.
