Their changes are tiny, and sensible.  See

But I'd like to ask about the status of reiser3 support.
Chris had patches *ages* ago to convert it to use direct-to-BIO for
reads, and writes should be done as well.  reiserfs3 is still using
buffer-head-based IO for bulk reads and writes.  That's a 25-30% hit
in CPU cost, and all the old ZONE_NORMAL-full-of-buffer_heads
problems.
Any plans to get that work finished off?
