Stop pointing to archives.
If you cannot give a http pointer to a specific thread, don't bother with 
the "please real the list" thing AT ALL.
And I'm sorry, "we decided this on linux-mm" doesn't cut it as an 
explanation _or_ as a "it's already been decided". Many relevant people 
simply aren't on that mailing list.
