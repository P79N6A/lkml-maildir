Hi,
While trying to get my Hauppauge's remote control working, I noticed that my
PC speaker is getting recognized as an input device. This seems very weird
to me, is there some logic behind this?
 takis@aether:~$ cat /proc/bus/input/devices
I: Bus=0010 Vendor=001f Product=0001 Version=0100
N: Name="PC Speaker"
P: Phys=isa0061/input0
S: Sysfs=/class/input/input0
H: Handlers=kbd event0
B: EV=40001
B: SND=6
...
I'm using the 2.6.17 kernel (it is an Ubuntu kernel though).
With friendly regards,
Takis
