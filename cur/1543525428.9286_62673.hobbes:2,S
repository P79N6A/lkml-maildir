Not worried about that - I'd consider that a worst-case scenario, and it's not like
I haven't blown up a filesystem before.  Besides - it's just a test system, so all
I'd have to do is re-install.  I have two new issues:
1) Has anyone tried compiling 2.3.43 for an SMP alpha box?  I get an error at final
link that there are undefined references to 'flush_tlb_pgtables' in mm/mmap.c.  I
tried the simple thing of making it an empty function for both UP and SMP, but that
just oopsed recursively after configuring the console.
2) Dave (or anyone for that matter) - is the qlogicisp driver in the 2.3.43 tree
supposed to work correctly?  Or am I supposed to grab the one from the vger CVS
tree?
Thanks!
