From 
http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/kernel-janitors/2004-January/000346.html
:
"The reason that check_region() is deprecated is that it is racy.
It could report that a region is available and then another driver
could immediately reserve that region, since check_region() doesn't
have any reservation capability."
/me wonders why check_region has not been killed, it has been
deprecated for years; killing it would force developers to fix it
and would help to identify unmaintained drivers...
