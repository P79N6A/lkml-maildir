At the moment, yes.

I agree. I'd much rather see us suspending devices whenever possible - 
it's just that I have concerns over the scalability of the blacklist, 
given the number of devices that seem to have issues.

Several printers seem to have the issue as well, and the blacklist seems 
to contain some odd miscellaneous devices like the Blackberry. The main 
concern I have is that kernel developers just don't tend to be the sort 
of people that use webcams, printers or scanners, so we're relying on 
normal users to go to the effort of reporting that their device has 
stopped working.

It's definitely a brute force approach, but it's one that means that we 
get the low hanging fruit (ie, pretty much anything that's likely to be 
plugged into a laptop) while massively reducing the probability of 
breaking anyone's system. Saving some power is a nice win, but breaking 
someone's printer is a pretty big loss.
