I have a brand-spanken-new laptop (less than a month old), and all my
hardware works great.  In fact, ATI drivers (only in pre-release X) only
work on 2.6, and ACPI never worked on 2.4.  So, it works better for me
than on 2.4.  Please be careful when saying that 2.4 is better than 2.6,
it's only that way for a narrow set of hardware.
