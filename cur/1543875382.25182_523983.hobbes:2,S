Subject: [PATCH 2.6.21-rc5] [I2O] block IO errors on i2o disk

I2O subsystem has been broken in mainstream several months ago (after 2.6.18).
The following patch from Jens Axboe splits struct request ->flags into two
parts: cmd_type and cmd_flags
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=4aff5e2333c9a1609662f2091f55c3f6fffdad36
In i2o layer this patch has replaced flag REQ_SPECIAL by the according cmd_type.
However i2o has used REQ_SPECIAL not as command type but as driver-specific flag
for the debug purposes. As result all i2o requests have type "special" now, are
not processed to the hardware and fail with I/O error:
 i2o/hda:<3>Buffer I/O error on device i2o/hda, logical block 0
Buffer I/O error on device i2o/hda, logical block 0
Buffer I/O error on device i2o/hda, logical block 0
 unable to read partition table
block-osm: device added (TID: 207): i2o/hda
The following patch removes the extra debug checks without any drawbacks and
restores the normal driver's work.
