I'd guess a hardware NFS accelerator would be the best solution, since
NFS waits for the actual blocks being written to disk physically and
does the ACK then. RAID5 would require matching block sizes, too.
There have been PrestoServe solutions some years ago. I'm still using 
one in an old SS10 machine, works great. Improves data integrity, too
(stores meta data and saves them after a crash or power outage)
Ask SunOnline whether they still exist.
