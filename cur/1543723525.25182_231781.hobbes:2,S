Hello,
I need some assistance with the kernel build system. It looks like this 
topic is not covered anywhere, at least I didn't find anything.
I have two modules, A and B, where B is dependant from A, i.e. uses some 
exported from it symbols. Both modules are built outside of the kernel 
tree.
With A everything is fine, it's compiled and installed with other kernel 
modules in /lib/modules/2.6.7/extra.
Then module B is built. Here I have a problem. Module A is not listed as 
the module from which B depends in .mod.c file, therefore there are 
"Undefined symbols" warnings and it is impossible to load B, even though 
A is loaded.
So, the question is: what should I do to make A be seen as exporting 
some symbols by the kernel and its build system?
The kernel is 2.4.7, EXPORT_SYMBOL() used in A as required.
Thanks,
Vlad
