Presumably you mean a 32-byte window?

As per my last message, it's NOT the printer that it's conflicting
with, but ide1 which for some reason is using 0x376 as one of its
ports.
Since both eth0 and ide1 work fine, I have to assume that my ne2k
clone isn't using 0x376 as one of its port addresses...
That leads to a repeat of the above question: Exactly what port
addresses does it use?
I will emphasise that I am NOT able to change the io address of either
the ne2k card or of ide1 so suggestions of doing that will be ignored.
Best wishes from Riley.
