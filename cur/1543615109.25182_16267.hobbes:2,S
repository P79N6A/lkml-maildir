X11 isn't always an improvement.  I've got an X hang on my laptop (about once 
a week) that freezes the keyboard and ignores mouse clicks.  Numlock doesn't 
change the keyboard LEDs, CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE won't do a thing, and although I 
can ssh in and run top (and see the CPU-eating loop), kill won't take X down 
and kill-9 leaves the video display up so the console that thinks it's in 
text mode, but isn't, is still useless.  (And that's assuming I'm plugged 
into the network and have another box around to ssh in from...)
Compiling a debug version of X to run under gdb via ssh is on my to-do list...
A userspace program that takes over your main I/O devices modally and keeps 
them if it hangs isn't THAT much better than having the kernel ignore you 
directly...
