Right .. and this is the scenario.  There are two cases where devices
kmap a user page into kernel space and then proceed to read from or
write to it (flush_dcache_page() is specifically for the latter because
the user won't see the data the kernel just wrote unless this happens
because kernel and user addresses aren't congruent on parisc).
The first case is manufactured data (such as command emulation) and the
second is pio data rather than DMA (such as command re-completion or
IDE).

For this particular scenario, the page is almost always mapped initially
in user space because the user is requesting the I/O to a given
userspace address ... get_user_pages() ensures that it is allocated and
flushed before being passed to IDE or SCSI.
The problem on parisc, however, is not that userspace doesn't see the
page as dirty, it's that we've dirtied the page through the kernel
mappings, so userspace itself cannot possibly see the change until the
cache over the kernel address is flushed (the userspace and kernel space
addresses are not congruent in our cache scheme, so get separate cache
lines).
