So the idea of tainting is to _prevent_ any binary code being loaded into
kernel, even if kernel is marked as having binary code loaded, which I
thought was the purpose of tainting (so that people not interested in dealing
with binary code know they don't have/want to)? If that is the goal, how do
you know this scheme of adding names to module loader in kernel guarantees
that (now or in future)? 
Thanks,
