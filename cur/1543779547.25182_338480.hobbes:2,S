I kept pulling modules and eventually got to 27Hz so something was definitely 
happening.
I need to ask you why you think limiting the maximum Hz is a bad idea? On a 
laptop, say we have set the powersave governor, we have already told the 
kernel we are interested in maximising power saving at the expense of 
performance. Would it not be appropriate for this to be linked in a way that 
sets maximum Hz to some value that maximises power save (whatever that value 
is) at that time?
Cheers,
Con
