Subject: [PATCH] 1/2 Make insert_resource work for alder IOAPIC resources
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is a necessary precursor patch for getting the Intel Alder
motherboard working (it has a PCI device corresponding to the IO-APIC
which has to be forcibly inserted into the machine's reserved memory
region).
Eric Biederman was going to come up with a more comprehensive fix, but
in the meantime, this is the minimum necessary to get insert_resource to
work when the covering region is larger than the resource being
inserted.
