Hi,
I have the problem that my new P4 (1.6 GHz Northwood) box with i845E
chipset doesn't boot with the 2.4.19(-pre2) kernel nor with the 2.5.31
kernel (I also tested RedHat and Suse kernels without success). But it
does boot with the late 2.2 series kernels (I tested 2.2.19 and 2.2.21).
After displaying the message "umcompressing linux ... ok. Bootig the
kernel" nothing else happens.
Can anybody please give me a hint how I can look for further debug
information ?
Best regards
