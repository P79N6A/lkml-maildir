 In the Debian package, on my Woody system, open is a symlink to openvt.
I've got console-tools 0.2.3.  The source uses access here:
  /* Maybe we are suid root, and the -c option was given.
     Check that the real user can access this VT.
     We assume getty has made any in use VT non accessable */
  if (access(vtname, R_OK | W_OK) < 0)
  {
     fprintf(stderr, _("Cannot open %s read/write (%s)\n"), vtname,
             strerror(errno));
     return (5);
  }
  That code could be "fixed" to work with the current kernel behaviour by
checking that errno != EROFS.  I thought access was supposed to tell you
whether open will work, except for directories, where you do different
things to write to them.  (I've seen your messages up to Tue, 28 Nov 2000

your arguments for me :)

 In the case of a directory, "writing" to it is creating or deleting files
in it: the list of filename:inode changes.  If the dir is on a read-only FS,
you can't write, so access() should fail.  Writing to a device file doesn't
change anything stored with the file, so it works even if the file is on a
read-only FS.

 What do you think access is for then?  Is it defined by the standard in
such a way that it isn't useful for anything?
 I'm of the opinion that Linux should work in the way that is most useful,
as long as that doesn't stop us from running stuff written for other unices.
Unix is mostly good, but parts of it suck.  There's no reason to keep the
parts that suck, except when needed for compatibility.  Changing the
behaviour of access here would not introduce security holes in anything, so
I think it should be changed to the more sensible way.
(That last paragraph is purely my opinion.  I'm pretty sure not everyone
shares it!)
