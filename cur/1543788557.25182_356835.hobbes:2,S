Ick, don't do that.

When you save the pointer off, you need to increment the count.

It doesn't matter.  Use udev to handle your device naming for you, it
can associate any type of name with any type of device you have, and you
can do it by topology, location, serial number, or the phase of the
moon.

Yes, on hotplug pci systems.  You can fake this out by testing with the
fakephp driver if you don't have this kind of hardware.

Again, use udev, that's what it is there for.
Hope this helps,
