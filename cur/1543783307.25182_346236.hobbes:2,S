I would definitely use this if available.
That said, I have often thought it might be good to have something like
pre-writing swap, ie reverse what your patch does.
In other words it'd keep as much of swappable data on disk as possible,
but without removing it from memory. So when it comes time to free up
some memory, the data is already on disk so no performance penalty from
writing it out.
Hopefully something worth thinking about.
