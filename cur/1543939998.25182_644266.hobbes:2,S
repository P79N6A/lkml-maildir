The code was only meant to be a base for discussions. It surely needs 
work. Our idea for the final version was to be able to read a thread's 
rusage from another thread strictly within the same process. The idea 
came from applications that need a cost enforcement mechanism. Having a 
mechanism for a thread to read it's own usage is essential. If there is 
a way to read other threads' rusage, it is even better.
Does Roland's patch (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/18/589
) look good to go 
in, provided Ulrich's comment (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/19/15
) is 
addressed?
Thanks,
Sripathi.
