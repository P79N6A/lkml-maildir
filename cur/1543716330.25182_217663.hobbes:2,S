hmm, just wanted to mention that linux-vserver has
around 0% overhead and often allows to improve 
performance due to resource sharing ... 
basically it's a soft partitioning concept based on 
'Security Contexts' which allow to create many 
independant Virtual Private Servers (VPS), which
act simultaneously on one box at full speed, sharing
the available hardware resources.
see 
http://linux-vserver.org
 for details ...
best,
Herbert
PS: UML and Linux-VServer play together nicely ...
