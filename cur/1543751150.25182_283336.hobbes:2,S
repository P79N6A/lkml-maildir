I have a problem with net-devices, ne2000 in particular, in 2.6.9 and 
2.6.10, too. After a resume the ne2000-device doesn't work anymore. I 
have to restart it using the initscripts.
How do I add suspend/resume support (to ISA devices, like my ne2000)?
Can you point me to some information/tutorial?
