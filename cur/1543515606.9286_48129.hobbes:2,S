Unfortunately it's not that simple, for some simple timer based data
collection RTLinux is a nice solution, but as soon as you want something
more advanced, e.g. realtime audio editing, you have problems, as this
usually requires a good IO system. Also if you want to go the desktop with
linux, there is still some work to do in the so called 'multimedia' area.
You can of course always upgrade your computer to improve such things, but
then you can also install this other 'os'.
bye, Roman
