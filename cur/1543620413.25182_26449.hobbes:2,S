as said in the previous email that becomes a buffercache mapped in
userspace, with refcount > 1 (unfreeable from the vm side), so the
__free_page from irq will do nothing (it will only decrease the refcount
of 1 unit, and then the page will be released by the vm). If the
refcount was 1 instead, then it means the page wasn't in the lru in the
first place and so the check won't trigger either.
Only truly anonymous pages (not ex pagecache, later become buffercache)
can trigger such PageLRU check in __free_pages_ok.  Infact if it wasn't
the case all the kernels before 2.4.1x would been broken.
