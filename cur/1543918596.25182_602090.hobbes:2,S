512 is for the default 4k cpu configuration that should be enough for most 
purposes. The hardware maximum is 16k and we need at least a kernel config 
option that covers the potential stack size issues.

These machines have very large amounts of memory (up to the maximum 
addressable memory of an x86_64 cpu). The fallback is as good as 
impossible. If you get into fallback then we are likely already swapping 
and doing other bad placement things. We typically tune the loads to avoid 
this.
