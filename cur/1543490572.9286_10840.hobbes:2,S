I can't see it being a kernel problem.  Here and a remote site both use ppp
2.3.5 as distributed with RH 5.2 and kernel 2.2.3.
Perhaps it's modem settings?  I've seen USR 33.6 and V.90 modems bomb when
connecting because of using ATZ, had to use AT&F1 to initialize the modem
instead to turn on HWFC (the remote site I spoke of uses a USR V.90 modem).
