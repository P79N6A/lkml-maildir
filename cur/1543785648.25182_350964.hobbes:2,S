doesn't "make allmodconfig" work for you?  That should generate a  
config with everything possible included as modules, and then you can  
compile that to generate .cmd files.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.  The first method is far more difficult.
