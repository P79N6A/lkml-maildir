That's bad.

Well, various approaches are possible.
First, you can build as many drivers as possible as modules and boot with
init=/bin/bash .  Then, try to suspend and resume and if that fails, the
problem is somewhere deeper.  If that goes well, one of the drivers is failing
and you'll need to find it (eg. by bisection).
Second, on x86 we have PM_TRACE which uses the RTC to store some debugging
information that can be used later to identify the point of failure.  This
might be portable to your platforms.
Next, you can use my recent patches (available at
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/hibernation_and_suspend/2.6.24-rc2/patches/
) to
check how deep the problem is located.
Greetings,
Rafael
