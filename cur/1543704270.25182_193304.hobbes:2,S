Ok.  After talking with George off-list, I think most of ppc_kgdb_init
can go.  The only remaining part is the serial plugin, which could be
done ala the kgdb_8250 driver.  But I've got a different idea:

 drivers/serial/kgdb_8250.c |    4 +---

This does mean that we can only have one serial driver per kernel, but I
don't see this as a problem.  This also means that i386 would need
something like PPC's CONFIG_KGDB_TTYSx to pick something other than
ttyS0/115200 to use kgdb on, this early.  But, IMHO, that's a small
price to pay.
