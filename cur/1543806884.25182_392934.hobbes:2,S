I'm talking about patches for problems that keep you from even testing
-mm, or that fix really annoying things you hit while testing.
E.g. in 2.6.16-rc1-mm4 we have:
        - SMP alternatives removes the lock prefix from instructions
          in every loaded module because it wrongly believes you are
          running an SMP kernel on UP.
        - Device-mapper mirroring is using the wrong endianness and will
          try to recover non-existent regions on the device.
        - Compiler spews hundreds of warning messages during build.
        - VGA console scrollback is totally broken because it prints
          a message on every scroll operation.
Patches for all of the above and more have been posted to the list and
I have applied them.  All I want is a place to collect them so they can
be more easily found.
