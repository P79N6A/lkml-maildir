Misapprehension of VM_DONTCOPY addressed in another reply.

It does seem to have four users intree now, so I hope it works.
It was a byproduct of when Linus thought he could get away with
limiting remap_pfn_range, in ways that later proved unsustainable.
It's a bit surplus to requirements now, but does have those users.
I'm not keen on it, because I think most drivers actually
want something slightly different (a remap_vmalloc_pages or a
remap_highorder_page).  But that will emerge later on, in that
fabled time when I go remove the SetPageReserveds from drivers.
Yes, there are some out-of-date comments thereabouts: I did correct
them once, but in one of those patches that Linus rejected.
insert_page does a page_add_file_rmap to bump the mapcount, yes;
but whether we ever "reverse map" from page to pte depends on other
things (page->mapping and prio_tree) certainly not set here, and
probably not (indeed, hopefully not!) done by any vm_insert_page
caller.  That criticism applies to all the page_add_rmaps and
page_remove_rmaps: we carried over the name from pte_chain days,
but the only thing that gets added or removed there now is "1".
