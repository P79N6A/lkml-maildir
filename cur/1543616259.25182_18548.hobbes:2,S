Why should it be included in the kernel image?  That's not the current
plan, as far as I know.  It should be a separate file or set of files
loaded by the bootloader (using an enhanced initrd protocol backward
compatible with old bootloaders.)  Of course, it might be convenient
to have them come out of the same source distribution, but that's
really an unrelated issue.
