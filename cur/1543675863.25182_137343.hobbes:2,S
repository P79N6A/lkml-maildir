But it does. Type /^foo <enter> and you're at the function definition. At
least when using vi, which is the editor everybody's using, right? ;-)
Also, when in working in a (too) long function body, type ?^{ and you're
at the start of the function body.

Indeed, searching for ^a will fail. There's no reason whatsoever why you'd
declare your variables that way.
