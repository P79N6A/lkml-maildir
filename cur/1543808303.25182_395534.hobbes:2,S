The second should be fixed by this:

commit 34ea80ec6a02ad02e6b9c75c478c18e5880d6713 
[SCSI] fix usb storage oops
The problem is that scsi_run_queue is called from scsi_next_command()
after doing a scsi_put_command.  If the command was the only thing
holding the reference on the scsi_device then the resulting device put
will tear down the block queue.  Fix this by taking a reference to the
device and holding it around scsi_run_queue()
