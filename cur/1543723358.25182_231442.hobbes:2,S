As far as I can see, the ameslab tree has _never_ contained those
lines.  The last change to chrp_setup.c was on 1 May 2004, and neither
that version nor any of the earlier versions that I looked at have
those lines.  Are you sure you don't have that as a local change in
your copy?  Do a bk sfiles -i and a bk push -n and see if it shows up.
In any case the #ifdef is redundant, because chrp_setup.o is only
linked in if CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES is set.
As for the RTAS messages being printk'd, the only possible
justification would be if there was a userspace tool to analyse them.
I don't know if such a thing exists, and if it does, I certainly don't
have a copy.  Is anyone working on that?
Paul.
