 Actually "err" is "static const char *", except it is used twice in the 
function, so rather than cluttering the source with two identical strings 
and relying on GCC merging them I did it explicitly.

 That would be my suggestion too, if you asked me.  But as did not, I do 
not either.

 Thanks for appreciation. ;-)

 Well, this is probably superfluous -- why would anyone prefer:
	int r0;
	int r1;
	int r2;
	int r3;
	int r4;
to:
	int r0, r1, r2, r3, r4;
unconditionally?  I agree clustering variable declarations may obfuscate 
the code, but then again, a bit of common sense should be used.  It 
usually makes sense to group related variables together and declare other 
ones separately.
 And obviously if somebody writes unreadable code, then it is hard to 
change the habit with a script no matter how much you try.
