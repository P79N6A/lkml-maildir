Note that code *will* blow: in effect, when we have a*2^b as object size,
we have to choose between
	* generic division by a*2^b (dog-slow pretty much on anything)
	* multiplication by such c that a*c == 1 (mod 2^word_size-b), then
shift down by b.
	* shift down by b, then multiplication by such c that a*c == 1
(mod 2^word_size).
And c in the above won't be small or pretty, so doing multiplication as
series of additions won't be short.
FWIW, I've seen very nasty cases (in userland code) where hot path got blown
by factor of 5 or so in size due to that; basically, it started with
#define INDEX(p) ((p)-array)
and that sucker got used a lot in other macros, so it wasn't immediately
obvious what had been going on.  So yes, we do want to be able to see
such cases.
