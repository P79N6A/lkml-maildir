Yes, if you have the UHCI driver loaded first, then when EHCI is loaded,
it disconnects everything on the bus and re-enumerates it.
But EHCI is built into the kernel first, before UHCI, so unless you are
using modules, nothing should be getting disconnected at boot time.
I really doubt you are using modules, so I don't know why it would be
disconnected.  What does the kernel log show right before this happened?
Any chance to enable CONFIG_USB_DEBUG?
thanks,
