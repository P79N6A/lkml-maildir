I have a Beige G3 PowerMac upgraded with a 1GHz G4 CPU
(a 7455 on a Sonnet board) and a standard (for x86) Promise
20269 PCI controller card. The 20269+cable+disk does udma5
just fine in a PC, but throws a few BadCRCs at bootup on
the PowerMac, resets and drops to udma4, and then things work
OK for me, but I don't stress it very much (no RAID).
Since the card's bios doesn't get run at powerup, I always
suspected that the driver fails to initialize some timing thing.
Another possibility is the "data coherency" issue in some
G4 CPUs which requires mappings of memory shared with other
agents to use some additional magic in the page table.
This issue caused file system corruption when I used
my G4 + 20269 combo under load with 2.4 kernels, until
I found and backported a fix from 2.6 to 2.4.28. It's
supposed to be handled transparently by arch/{ppc,powerpc},
but it's possible the driver is mapping things incorrectly.
(This is just speculation.)
I can provide bootup logs and lspci dumps if you want.
