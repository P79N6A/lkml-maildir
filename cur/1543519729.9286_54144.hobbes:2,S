hmm - so if i do short bursted threads ( approx < 0.1 seconds each on
average i guess ) will he get scheduled across spuc or be weighted to
remain on the same cu due to MM afinity (whihc is why i'd use therads
since they will share memeory space and MM affinity heavily) - so will
hey get scheduled across cpu's - i asked san mehat about this and he
sugsted tey'd end up all being scheduled on the same cpu - giving no
speedup ?
