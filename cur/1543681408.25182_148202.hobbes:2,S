Hello,
	Is there any (un)official patch for current stable (or
development) kernel that makes loop device partitioned? I found one on
the 
ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/ig/ccd/enhanced_loopback/
 (it contains
port of Scyld's partition enhancements), but it seems still needs a fix.
In general I plan to use partitioned loop device to simulate real disks
in linux labs, possibly with a help from Stephen Tweedie's testdrive
fault simulator. I just wonder if partitionable/faultable loop device
planned in the future official kernels, or it will be better to write a
separate 'simulated disk' driver???
Thanks in advance,
Dimitry.
