#include <hallo.h>
I two Pioneer DVD U04S (SCSI) 10x DVD 40xCD. When i want to play CD-Rs
they are "loud". So i searched for a "slowdown" Programm on freshmeat and
fount "cdrom_speed.c". The problem is that the drive seems to ignore the
speed changes and spins the CDR with full speed.
Kernel is 2.2.17, HA is an adaptec 7895. (Drives are Pioneer DVD U04S)
Is there something i can do? Or do i have to change the drives with U03S
ones. (Which are nearly noiseless)
Bis denn

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as 
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
