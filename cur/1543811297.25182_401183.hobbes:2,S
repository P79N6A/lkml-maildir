No.  It's sd.c assuming that mode page header is sane, without any
checks.  And yes, it does give memory corruption if it's not.
Initio-related part is in scsi_lib.c (and in recovery part of sd.c
changes).  That one is about how we can handle gracefully a broken
device that gives no header at all.
Checks for ->block_descriptors_length are just making sure we won't try
to do any access past the end of buffer, no matter what crap we got from
device.
