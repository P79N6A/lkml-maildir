Hello all,
everyone knows that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and benchmarks.
Despite of this obvious fact, recently I've tried to compare pipe performance on
Linux and FreeBSD systems. Unfortunately, Linux results are poor - ~2x slower than
FreeBSD. The detailed description of the test case, preparation, environment and
results are located at 
http://213.148.29.37/PipeBench,
 and everyone are pleased to
look at, reproduce, criticize, etc.
Thanks,
Dmitry
