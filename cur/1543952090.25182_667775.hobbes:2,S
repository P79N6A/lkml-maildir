I must have done something wrong. I now see a switch between C6 and C3
when I play with the AC cord.
On that theme, I've tested fiddling with the real C-states. I've added
a new max_hwcstate that makes ACPI downgrade MWAIT hints. I also made
some odd discoveries:
C3: More or less completely silent (I haven't tested it in a really
quiet environment yet).
C4: Constant noise
C5: Constant noise
C6: Intermittent noise
When I say constant, I mean that the noise is not generated as a result
of switching between modes (to any extent I can see at least). The
average time spent in C3 (as reported by Powertop) is over 200 ms. So
that would give a frequency of around 5 Hz, not a consistent tone of
several kHz.
Here's said patch. Please comment as I hope this can be merged:
