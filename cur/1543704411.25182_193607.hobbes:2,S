Hi all...
I have a problem with modprobe, 2.6.2-rc1-mm2, and agpgart.
With 2.4, I had this setup to have agpgart loaded:
alias char-major-226 agpgart
With 2.6 and the same setup, that module is loaded. But as agpgart backend is
now split, I need to load also intel-agp.ko. I read manuals, and corrected my
modprobe.conf this way:
install agpgart /sbin/modprobe intel-agp; /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install agpgart;
But it goes on an infinite loop :(.
I got this working with
alias char-major-226 intel-agp
How can I get the good old 'above' with new module init tools ?
TIA
