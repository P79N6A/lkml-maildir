As I understand it:
1) Ring transitions aren't free.
2) The API between drivers and kernel is always in flux; drivers
   expect to be able to access internal kernel data structures.
   Making drivers run in ring 1 on even one of the N architectures
   would be a major refactoring and would constrain API changes.
   Freezing the internal API is something the developers don't want to
   do.
3) There are probably plenty of ways for a buggy driver to crash the
   kernel even if it's running in ring 1 (turn off interrupts and
   leave them off, etc).
So the upshot is that it's probably not worth the work and portability
hassles.
