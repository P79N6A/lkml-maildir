Wouldn't it be fairly simple for the kernel to just remember the (wall
clock) time at boot, and uptime just subtract that from the current
(wall clock) time? It would be another variable in the kernel requiring
storage but not having a whole lot of use, but what's another 8 bytes
these days? (ok, maybe it would be more critical in embedded and other
such space critical applications, but not for general desktop/server
use...)
