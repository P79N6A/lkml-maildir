So, your disk might be broken.

That's because disk I/O is blocked, the SCSI disk doesn't have access
to some sectors anymore, and the system gets into a loop retrying.

I've had this a couple of times. Usually the binaries that are needed
to boot the system are on a part of the disk that is still intact,
probably because you only _read_ from that part of the disk. As soon
as you start accessing / writing the defective parts of the disk,
the trouble starts.
Replacing the disk usually helps. Oh and make sure you have good
ventilation in the case - heated up disks usually demise prematurely.
