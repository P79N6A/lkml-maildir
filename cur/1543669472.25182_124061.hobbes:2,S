It may be worth noting that I'm not seeing any problems between an AMD XP
1800+ client running 2.5.66-mm3 and an AMD K6-2 300 server running SuSE's
2.4.18-4GB kernel. SuSE applies quite a lot of NFS-related patches to their
kernels, if I'm not mistaken.
I'm mounting /home, /var/spool/mail and /mp3 over NFS, so I think I should
have noticed problems if there were any ;-)
