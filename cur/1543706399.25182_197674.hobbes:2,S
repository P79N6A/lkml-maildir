What names would you use for your device files?  This is the key 
difference.  With udev it gets a notification that says "I have a new 
block device", it then looks it up, applies the rules, and creates a new 
entry.  The whole point is to move the naming scheme into userspace for 
easier management.
You could have the kernel export a simple devfs with a hardcoded naming 
scheme based on similar ideas as what is in sysfs (which would then make 
sysfs and the daemon optional for tiny embedded setups), but the only 
advantage over just exporting the information in sysfs is to save a few 
bytes at the cost of yet another filesystem to maintain.
