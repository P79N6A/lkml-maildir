And just to be complete, the problem with this is that it is tied to the
request queue and so you cannot just send a transport level request
unless it is tied to the device. But for the target stuff we added a
request queue to the host so we could inject requests (the idea was to
send down those magic message requests) at a higher level.  To be able
to use that for sg io though it would require some more code and magic
as you know.
