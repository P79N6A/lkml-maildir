For most of the architectures aimed at embedded systems, having an
arch/foo/defconfig makes no sense. The basic "framework" is to have
arch/foo/configs and place all of your board-specific defconfigs in there
(as boardname_defconfig -- the reason for this is that you get free make
targets of the same name which copy the defconfig over, see 'make help').
If you have a particular board that you can assume will be kept
reasonably up-to-date, you can set KBUILD_DEFCONFIG in your Makefile to
set the default config to use by name, and then you can forego having an
arch/foo/defconfig entirely (you can look at sh and some of the other
architectures to see this being done).
