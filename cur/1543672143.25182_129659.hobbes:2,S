Yes. Mkinitrd in RH8.0 does not comprehend the .ko extension for kernel
modules. Search and replace .o witk .ko in mkinitrd (4 occurrences) and you
will be OK.

Subject: Cannot install 2.5.68 on Red Hat 8
I have been trying to install 2.5.68 on an SMP box running a fairly bog 
standard Red Hat 8 distro.
The compile works, but the installation fails:
Kernel: arch/i386/boot/bzImage is ready
sh arch/i386/boot/install.sh 2.5.68 arch/i386/boot/bzImage System.map ""
No module aic7xxx found for kernel 2.5.68
make[1]: *** [install] Error 1
make: *** [install] Error 2
I understand, from googling old lkml messages, that this is likely to be due
to Red Hat's mkinitrd.
Is that correct?
Is there a fix?
Adrian
