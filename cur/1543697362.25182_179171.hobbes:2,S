Hi nick! here's some feedback.
This one day last week, I thougt I could test your scheduler patch.
I noticed something really good with it. My X had really fast startup.
everything worked really fast. Even games worked much better than any in
kernel before (I've tested all from 2.5.74).
So I hope you'll port this patch for test10> if this one wont patch
clearly.
Thanks.
