NPTL locking is implemented on top of futex(2).
futex(2) queues are ATM FIFOs, not priority based queues.
Check 
http://developer.osdl.org/dev/robustmutexes/
for some patches which introduce priority based queues for futexes (well,
AFAIK they introduce new syscalls and call the primitive fusyn instead).
