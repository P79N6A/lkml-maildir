Ah, I forgot --- Real Submitters don't compile their code before
submission.  But wait, they also don't track CodingStyle.
Seriously though:  Precise rules are a priori welcome.  But the more
rules there are, the less of them we (authors, reviewers) can memorize.
If we go for having many rules, then we need to rely more on checkpatch
and sparse.  When growing into a catch-all rule book, the utility of
CodingStyle will shift from an author's guide to a specification for
code checking tools.
