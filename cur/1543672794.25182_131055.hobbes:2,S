  Ptrace appears to be effectively broken on 2.4.21-rc -- I can't strace
child processes that fork even as root, anyway.

  I'm sorry but I've been looking at the md code for about six months
and the 'big picture' of how it's doing what it does escapes me.  The
code in md.c:lock_rdev(), for example -- looks like an incredibly deep
understanding of how all the block code works is needed to write a
driver like this.
