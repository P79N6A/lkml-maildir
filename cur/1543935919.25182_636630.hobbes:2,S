cool patch, applied!
a few suggestions:
a fundamental one: could you do a save_stack_trace() and check that both 
the process context and the irq context functions are present in that 
trace? If not then flag it as a regression and emit a real WARN_ON() 
warning.
i.e. use save_stack_trace() to do a "silent" test - instead of emitting 
backtraces during bootup. (which are marked via 'this is not a bug' but 
which are visually active nevertheless.)
the locking selftests use similar techniques to never emit real 
warnings, just a readable table of test results:
 | Locking API testsuite:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  | spin |wlock |rlock |mutex | wsem | rsem |
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      A-A deadlock:  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |
                  A-B-B-A deadlock:  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |
internally, while the test is running, lockdep is triggered for real but 
the debug output and the backtraces are supressed.
and a few small details:

the printks need a KERN_ attribute.

would be nice to have a testcase for the NMI watchdog and the softlockup 
watchdog as well: do they properly detect lockups on all CPUs?
