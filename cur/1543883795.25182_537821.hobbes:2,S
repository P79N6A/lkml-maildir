The indirection was needed to vmalloc()/vmap() the IRQ stacks. It
should probably be decided explicitly whether vmalloc() of the IRQ
stacks is considered desirable for any mainline merge of these things.
This code is by no means sacred to me, so I have no particular
preference with respect to the suggested tradeoffs or reworks. Whatever
people want out of all this for mainline (even if nothing) is fine by me.
