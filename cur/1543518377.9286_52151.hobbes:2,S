I don't see how it's much different, actually. Just as ld.so must
ignore LD_* environment variables for setuid programmes, MAP_INHERIT
can be ignored for setuid. And with MAP_INHERIT, you don't have to
worry about ld.so being replaced with something that *doesn't* ignore
LD_*.
So, sure, you have a few more calls to mmap(2) libc and syscall.so and
such. Once for each switch to a privileged state. That's a minor loss.
It's easy enough for each programme to check if there are any
inherited mappings: just use the new syscall.

Why not? If the shared areas are mapped to the same virtual address,
we can keep the same TLB entry.

I'm not suggesting that we don't have a global page. But I think that
global page should only have *data*. No code.

Sure. But you're talking about two different things. One is global
code for syscall entry points, which can be done from user-space (with
MAP_INHERIT). The other is global kernel data, which obviously is a
kernel thing.
Two different things, two simple mechanisms, rather than a single,
bigger mechanism.
