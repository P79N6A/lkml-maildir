Dear all linux kernel experts,
Do help me asap as this is an urgent case. I'd compiled 2.6.12 linux
fedora kernel and I encountered kernel panic when i boot it. My
machine is Dell Optiplex GX520. This is the error message:
  umount /sys failed : 16
  mount: error 6 mounting ext2
  mount: error 2 mounting none
  switchroot: mount failed: 22
  umount /initrd/dev failed: 2
  Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
Thank you very much for your prompt rescue!
Regards,
Lin
