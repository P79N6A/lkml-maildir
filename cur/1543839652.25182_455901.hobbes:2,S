Doing a "cat /proc/stat" also indicates that the problem is not present.
I wonder if the two xterms and/or their shells are have different nice 
values (or scheduling policies)?
Also is the presence of PREEMPT in the uname output for the 2.6.17.8 
kernel (not present in the 2.6.8.1 kernel's output) significant? 
Presuming that this signifies the CONFIG_PREEMPT option is selected it 
is worth noting that I do not have this selected in the kernel I tested.
