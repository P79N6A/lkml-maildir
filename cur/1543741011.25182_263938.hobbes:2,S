Hi list,
since 2.6.9-rc2 CDROMEJECT is no longer working when using ide-scsi.
(At least for my Sony DVD RW DW-U55A. I've tried 2.6.8.1, 2.6.9-rc[1234], 
and 2.6.9.)
strace eject /dev/scd0 reports
[...]
open("/dev/scd0", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK)  = 3
ioctl(3, CDROMEJECT, 0xbffffbd8)        = 0
close(3)                                = 0
[...]
but nothing happens.
I know that using ide-scsi is deprecated for cd burning but: is this a 
feature or a bug?
Greetings,
Denny
