	I'm the one responsible for this patch. I can't boot my powerpc7600 whithout 
it. I've been pushing this patch (on the linux-ppc list) for so long (several 
years, don't remember), that I've given up last year.
	Linuxppc people are even worse than Linus. I did not even get an answer 
about a problem with my patch or whatever. Pure 'nothing'. Not even a 'no'.
	I'm still ready to test/discuss about the pb with anybody, anyway.
	Let's get clear about what I've done : I'm using linuxppc for many years, 
and at one point, the kernel refused to boot. I've checked the difference 
between this kernel and the last one I was using, and merely changed back the 
mesh.c so that it works. As I was not following kernel dvpmt very closely by 
then, I can't tell when the change that broke things came in.
	I would be very happy to change my patch so that this change is optional.
happy new year,
Thomas
