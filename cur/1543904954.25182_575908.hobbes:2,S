If you have a "chirpy" serial controller with only a 1 byte
fifo, even a quite reasonable interrupt handler can cause
receive characters to get lost if you disable interrupts during
the entirety of it's execution.
It really is needed.
And it's just plain rude to disable interrupts when it isn't
absolutely necessary.
