Uhhh... How about using a separate slab for the DMA buffers?

SLABs mininum object size is 32 thus you had no problems. I see. SLAB 
does not guarantee 32 byte alignment. It just happened to work. If you 
switch on CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG you will likely get into trouble.
So I'd suggest to set up a special slab for your DMA buffers.
