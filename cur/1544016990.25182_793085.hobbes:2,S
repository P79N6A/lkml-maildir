Hey, nice work Dave. +3% performance from your previous patch
(31.6 MB/s). It's going fine and stable here.

If you're interested, this week-end I can do some tests on my
myri10ge NICs which support LRO. I frequently observe 23 kB
packets there, and they also support jumbo frames. Those should
cover the case above.
I'm afraid that's all for me for this evening, I have to get some
sleep before going to work. If you want to cook up more patches,
I'll be able to do a bit of testing in 5 hours now.
Cheers!
