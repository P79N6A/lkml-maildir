Well given that the two older APIs both provide this
functionality, it seems that it is desired in applications. It 
is a shame that the new API doesn't have this.  It could be 
added (I'm inclined to say, it should be): the only problem
is that the syscall is now out in the wild, so a change at
this point would not be ABI compatible.  However, it only just 
got into the wild (and hasn't made it into glibc yet), so now
would be a good time to fix it, if you are agreeable, and the
kernel gatekeepers are prepared to tolerate the ABI change.
Cheers,
Michael
