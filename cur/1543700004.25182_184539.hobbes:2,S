You should not abitrarily flush all the writes with a read
after each write. The PCI/Bus is a FIFO, stuff will get to
the hardware in the order written. If you "flush" every write,
you will seriously hurt the performance. I don't like that
MACRO/Function, whatever it is with the switch shown previously.
All that code just for a "@(*^&$(*^(" write will screw up
performance. I've looked at the result of some the the MACRO
expansions, in particular the get_user, put_user, and copy_to/from
macros where there is a switch. It is not pre-processed out.
Cheers,
