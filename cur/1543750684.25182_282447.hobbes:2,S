Using multiple calls to printk to print a single line has always been
subject to the possibility of interleaving on SMP.  We just live with
the risk.  Printing a complete line in a single call to printk is
protected by various locks.  Print a line in multiple calls is not
protected.  If it bothers you that much, build up the line in a local
buffer then call printk once.
