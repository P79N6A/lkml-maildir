I'm sorry, but what "VIA fixes" are we referring to?
My hardware:
- VIA  Apollo Pro 133A - VIA VT82C686A South, VIA VT82C693A North
The only problem I have ever had with my system had to do with the 
onboard sound (via82cxxx_audio driver specifically), and Mr. Jeff
Garzik promptly issued a patch which corrected my problem.
I'm currently running linux kernel 2.4.8 with no problems whatsoever.
