This feature was mentioned in v1.1 spec, so some distributions already
provide "experimental" versions of this feature. There are no Open
Source projects I know of, though.

Yes, we are aware of this and have accepted this limitation.

Well, in the system where the use of app-preloading is planned to done
the unit in question will most likely be diskless, i.e. have no swap.
It will load _all_ of it's applications over network (like NFS) at boot
time (we assume there is enough physical memory). 
Note that this feature requires support in glibc, and I talked with
Ullrich in January and he said he is not going to merge the patch that
was sent to him, because he considers it too off-beat. So this will
require extra work for distros.

I'll let somebody wiser than me to comment on this one, as I do not
recall the reasoning behind this feature right know ;-)

Ah, we are not aiming to get our features into a certain kernel version,
and actually we do not expect or even want (because of 2.6
stabilization) that our v2 spec kernel features get merged into 2.6 at
this point of time (some of them might, though).
For us it is enough that the distros will pick most of the features
after v2 specs get released and through that adaption some of
those features will get merged into 2.7 or whatever is coming after 2.6.
So we are not in hurry ;-)
One thing that tends to be debated quite often in CGL is that some
people think that POSIX specs are religious texts to be followed
literally, while some believe that the writers were human and so
we should evaluate carefully which POSIX features are actually used by
the industry. Oh well ...

Yes, we follow what is happening around. Really the requirement is just
to get POSIX threads, if it gets done by NPTL we are OK with that. NGPT
is mentioned because some distros currently ship with it and so from
CGL viewpoint fulfill this requirement with NGPT.

Ahem, yes, there has been some ... errr... debate about AEM on
cgl_discussion also. I will just say that asynchronous events seems
to be a required feature, how it gets implemented is different story.

Well, I'll not get into debate about code quality, but rather I'll point
out that from customers viewpoint:
  a) bad implementation is better than no implementation (well, it is
     easier to "sell" something than nothing ;-)
  b) our spec (and the whole CGL) is only doing "guidance"; what the
     individual projects, distro companies or their customers do is
     out of our hands
As noted in above snippet, we acknowledge that STREAMS (and LiS as project)
probably has no change to get merged, and because of the limited lifetime
of the feature (STREAMS really seems to be a legacy support thingy), it
makes no sense even think about merging STREAMS support to mainline. But
that is our opinion, feel free to disagree.
Thanks for your comments!
