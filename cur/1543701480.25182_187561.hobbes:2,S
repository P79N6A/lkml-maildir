Thanks for cutting down on the CCs, this is getting out of hand.

There are features available in both the ati and nvidia closed source
drivers that are not available in DRI.  If I want "full use" of my
hardware, then DRI is does not "work best" for me.
Regardless, I should not have used the word "political" in my response to
Tomas.

What would probably happen, as has happened with the aureal vortex, is
that someone would maintain the open source wrapper.  Possibly until
someone reverse engineered the driver (as happened with the aureal vortex)
- but I wouldn't hold my breath on that for something as complicated as a
graphics card.

Is nvidia aware of this issue?  If you're forced to keep that laptop, it
might be worth your time to bring it up with them.
Better would be to return the laptop and follow Joel Jaeggli's advice
from earlier in this same thread, but unfortunately that's probably not an
option.

The closed source modules "work best" for me, as some of the code I play
with uses vertex buffer objects.
I realize that tomorrow nvidia could drop linux support, next week someone
could discover that echo HI\ MOM > /dev/nvidiactl gives them a root shell.
But for my situation, these things are an acceptable trade for the added
toys.
