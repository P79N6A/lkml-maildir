Why? My consoles are *all* still 80x24 text mode. It's only if I decide to 
monkey with the settings (and why fix what isn't broken?) or when I'm in X 
that I get a bigger screen than that.
I think the general consensus on the 80 character lines isn't for the average 
home user, but for the people that have things like old Wyse terminals and 
such hooked up.
