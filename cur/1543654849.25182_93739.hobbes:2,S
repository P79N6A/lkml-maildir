With a lot more code.

the code, not so much the commandline option (that one is not used
in practice), but actually my biggest concern is that you break existing
setups, or at least change it more than needed. There is ZERO need to
remove the existing working (and lean) code, even though your code might
also be able to do the same. It means people suddenly need to change all
kinds of config options, it's different code so will work slightly
different... unifying 2.5 is nice and all but there's no need for that
here since both implementations can coexist trivially (as the United Linux
kernel shows)
