I see what you are getting at.  But notice, that every (relevant)
field of nameidata is reinitialized, except nd->flags, which is
_obviously_ not changed by either path_walk() or path_release().
So your argument doesn't hold.
You basically argue, that intent.open.file must be zeroed, because
someone might call path_release_open_intent() twice, which very
obviously does not make any sense, unless it does some magic like the
above (which it should not), in which case it might as well be aware,
that it has to save/restore the intent.open.file field as well.

Yes, that would make sense.
