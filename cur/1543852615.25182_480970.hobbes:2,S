That should mean that it is not a HW pci bus issue, though I
still have seen odd MB failures that cause corruption and don't
show anywhere (pci, ecc, mcelog), and only show up with cksums
on specific pieces of hw.
I don't have any good way of find those, we swapped one part
at a time until it went quit doing it.
