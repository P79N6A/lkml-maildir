Say a module is inserted that intercepts all socket operations and
it happened in the middle of several established connections.
Save me some time please and answer what fields in struct sock
or elsewhere can be examined to determine reliably if the current
established
connections had been accepted (i.e. accept call) or initiated (i.e.
connect)
from the local machine.
