Its jpg coming out of the camera, but I don't know to capture the raw 
stream and do the comparisons.  One would have to first subtract the 
expected peak values of the sensors noise (snow if you will), either 
by a running average obtained by frame addition on a pixel by pixel 
basis.  Somehow, that seems to imply a decoded stream.  And thats 
obviously not going to be anything but cpu intensive too.  So I'm 
less than enthusiastic that its a workable solution unless one is 
able to dedicate a machine to that job exclusively.  X10 FIR's like 
the EagleEye or HawkEye will need to be used to detect when the 
recording should be started (and stopped)
Many thanks to the responders here.
