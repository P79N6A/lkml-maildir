I am inclined to agree. But the obvious absence of knowledge about the PCI 
interrupt table or perhaps the ACPI issue is really harsh, isn't it? (IRQ 
255!!)
Above that, the commiter DID IGNORE your baselines of testing, but at the same 
time got highly profile-neurotic regarding the copyright issue of 2007, 
didn't he (Let's call this a basic instinct of our precedents: the apes: 
shouting: I, I, I, more, more, more)?

I do agree and I do confirm to that, as it makes deep sense.

You do response positive, and I thank you for that. Well done, Andrew! :)
But, apart from that, I am still hosting (or forking, if you may wish) a 
couple of patches for the v4l-dvb area that do touch about seven files, 
trying to make at least my system more effective (small is beautiful, isn't 
it?).
Now, one of them will be part of the next mm-tree, while the future of all the 
other ones is more than unclear or invisible.
And I have not been hosting those since yesterday but in fact I have been 
hosting them for weeks and for months now.
And this situation is nothing but the product of some personal issues with 
exactly FOUR (!) v4l-dvb-developers involved, who, due to their borders of 
knowledge which they cannot and will not deal with in a constructive open 
positive manner, seem to have lost every kind of touch to mother earth (I do 
avoid to use the expression "responsibility", as it has been proven to be 
senseless to tell them in the past).
In other words: The ego ellbow issues do rule and thus do block every kind of 
constructive evolution that everyone would deeply appreciate.
More clear:  You see at linuxtv.org a repository of 20 (!) developers, but 
they neither do nor intend to be a functionable team :(
And one of them tries to solve that by playing the "big boss" without having 
absolutely no idea about DVB issues at all.
PLUS: Nowhere in the worldwide linux community outside the v4l-dvb microcosmos 
the situation is such disagreeable and ellbow-ego-issued (if not to say: 
disgusting and counterproductive and simply discouraging) as at linuxtv.org!
Now, even if you offered me to post the other patches for testing reasons to 
be implied into the mm-tree I can foresee the NACK of Manu Abraham or Mauro 
Chehab, without expalining the what and why!
That does not mean that we should not try one more time to at least get them 
into the mm-tree (which I would regard as positive attempt, definitely!), but 
that only means that I am, proven by experience, more than hopeless, if not 
to say: pessimistic! :(
And that's it definitely what they seem to want:
Keep on doing their ellbow-egoistic policy, without any criticism or critical 
objections!
Andrew, would you call that situation acceptable or agreeable?
My answer you can easily guess!
I do detest people adding their copyrights into code of whatever kind, but, at 
the same time, producing absolutely nothing but broken crap!
Those people are not, and will never be, a positive impact for the whole 
worldwide linux community.
Basta!
