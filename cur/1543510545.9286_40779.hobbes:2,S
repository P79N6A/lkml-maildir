There is a small mistake in get_recursive_lock(). I have rectified it and
reposting the function. We don't need to lock     r->data_to_lock   
(r->data_to_lock = 1) inside the if(atomic ...) because it was done by the
atomic_test_and_set.
Also still there could be some race conditions because we are not locking
the structure r itself while manipulating its fields (owner_id and
lock_count) but these will be harmless. Infact we cannot lock the
structure r because then it will not be recursive because the lower level
function will block while trying to lock the structure resulting in a
deadlock.
get_recursive_lock(recursive_lock_t *r)
{
    if(atomic_test_and_set(&r->data_to_lock) == 0) {     /* if lock is free */
        /* RECTIFICATION : following line is not required */ 
        /*r->data_to_lock = 1; */           /* lock it */
        r->owner_pid = current->pid;    /* make ourself as the owner */
        r->lock_count = 1;              /* first instance of this lock */
        return;
    }        
    ...
    (rest same as before) 
}
Counting semaphores (with down(&sem) and up(&sem) primitives) cannot be
used to have recursive locks because first this is a blocking lock, and
second with sem->count the recursion will be limited.
Kindly correct me whereever i am wrong.
