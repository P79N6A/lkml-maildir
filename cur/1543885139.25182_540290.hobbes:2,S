OK, sure. I think we need more numbers though.
And even if this was a patch with _no_ possibility for regressions and it
was a completely trivial one that improves performance in some cases...
one big problem is that it uses another page flag.
I literally have about 4 or 5 new page flags I'd like to add today :) I
can't of course, because we have very few spare ones left.
 From the MySQL numbers on this system, it seems like performance is in the
noise, and MADV_DONTNEED makes the _vast_ majority of the improvement.
This is also the case with Rik's benchmarks, and while he did see some
improvement, I found the runs to be quite variable, so it would be ideal
to get a larger sample.
And the fact that the poor behaviour of the old style malloc/free went
unnoticed for so long indicates that it won't be the end of the world if
we didn't merge MADV_FREE right now.
