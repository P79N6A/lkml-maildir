What if drivers could indicate how much "jitter" (essentially, latency) 
its interrupts can tolerate?  Higher jitter would SORTOF translate into 
lower priority, although the scheduler would make sure the IRQ was 
started before its tolerance ran out (ie. the priority approaches 
infinity as its tolerance period approaches the end).  The jitter 
tolerance would be measured in microseconds, I guess.
