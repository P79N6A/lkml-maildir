Oh, you meant that allocating a huge buffer might cause problems elsewhere.
I don't think that was the cause of the entire slowdown, certainly not on
a 256MB machine with nothing else running.

What I meant was, how to make a stream socket behave like a pipe and consume
only 4k at a time.  I'll try [rw]mem_max, but when I tweaked the skb_alloc(?)
call in af_unix.o, the write() still gobbled as much as it could.
