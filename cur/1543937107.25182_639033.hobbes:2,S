Most of the kbuild bits have been pretty painless. I started out going
the SRCARCH route, but that ended up creating a lot of additional
duplication, so I opted to just roll them together and stick with abusing
KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG for restricting the options. Based on the heavy sharing
between the Kconfig options, this seemed to be the best way to go.
So, I'm reasonably content with it the way it is, but any input you have
on cleaning it up is certainly welcome at any time :-)
