Just thinking about this a bit more, this does have some practical  
value.  This would allow a process to acquire a "PID handle", such  
that it could later reliably send a signal to this process without  
worrying about any of the traditional PID reuse issues.  This would  
also solve some of the problems of the process checkpointing people.
