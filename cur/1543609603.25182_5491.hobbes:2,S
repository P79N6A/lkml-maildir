I'm hearing rumours about my University wanting to set up a cluster with AMD
Athlon XP+DDR computers, so I wonder what chipset is most stable under
Linux?
I assume it's the AMD DDR chipset, but I want to be pretty sure.
Btw, do compilators currently optimize for the third floating-point unit in
Athlon XP processors?
