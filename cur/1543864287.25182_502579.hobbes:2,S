Both kernels are self-compiled or is 2.6.19 a distribution kernel?
It could be that 2.6.20-rc6 has a bug and therefore no longer is able to 
use your controller.
It's also possible that the enumeration changed (e.g. sda is now an 
external hard disk).
During boot, there should be some messages prefixed with ata: and sda: 
describing what your kernel found and how it enumerated them.
What do they print with 2.6.20-rc6?
