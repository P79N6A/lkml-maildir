i'm not really happy about this change.
Firstly, most WARN_ON()s are /bugs/, not warnings ... If it's a real 
warning, a KERN_INFO printk should be done.
Secondly, the reason i changed it to the 'BUG: ...' format is that i 
tried to make it easier for automated tools (and for users) to figure 
out that a kernel bug happened.
