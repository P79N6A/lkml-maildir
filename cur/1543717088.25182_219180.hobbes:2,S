Hi Andrew, 
I would just like to say that I have no difficulties with intermezzo being
rm -rf'd.  There are probably only a handful of users.   
In the past 4 years nobody has supported InterMezzo sufficiently for it to
become successful. I have been fortunate to get really good support for the
Lustre project.  So I have focussed on that.  Lustre 1.X has become really
solid.
The disconnected operation, caching and mirroring functionality of
InterMezzo will become available in Lustre as a new feature in version 2.  
So I see no point in keeping InterMezzo if it is a nuisance.  
I am also entirely happy to ask my one part time InterMezzo programmer to do
a better job of repeatedly sending pathes until they are in.
Please guide me along.  Thanks!
