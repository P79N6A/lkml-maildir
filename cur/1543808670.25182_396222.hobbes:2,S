Hi folks,
When running a 2.6.16-rc2 kernel on a powerpc system (Mac Mini;
Freescale 7447A):
$ date && touch f && ls -l f && rm -f f && date
Sun Feb 12 12:20:14 GMT 2006
-rw-r--r-- 1 rleigh rleigh 0 2006-02-12 12:23
Sun Feb 12 12:20:14 GMT 2006
Notice the timestamp is 3 minutes in the future compared with the
system time.  "make" is not a very happy bunny running on this kernel
due to every touched file being 3 minutes in the future.
When the same command is run on 2.6.15.3:
$ date && touch f && ls -l f && rm -f f && date
Sun Feb 12 14:27:27 GMT 2006
-rw-r--r-- 1 rleigh rleigh 0 2006-02-12 14:27
Sun Feb 12 14:27:27 GMT 2006
In this case the times are identical, as you would expect.
In both these cases, the chrony NTP daemon is running, if that might
be a problem.
Regards,
Roger
