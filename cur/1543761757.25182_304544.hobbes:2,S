Indeed, such setup is quite typical for southbridge chips with
integrated IDE controller - they still simulate sort of ISA IRQ
routing...

Ok, but asm-generic/pci.h is not a good place for default IRQ 14/15 case -
this header cannot be included on non-x86 without additional #ifdef's.
Perhaps we can move it to linux/pci.h or linux/ata.h (as Bart noted)?
