allmost, as new names should be ethx type of names, because many tools
would break otherwise, they should be first renamed to temporary names
and then to wanted ethx names.

Maybe not kernel problem per se, but definately nic-driver
probing/identifying problem.
If we can, and in many cases must, give media, io and irq specifications,
then why not mac definition.
By giving 'options ne io=0x300,0x320' I can definately specify that card at
io 0x300 is eth0 and card at io 0x320 is eth1.
With pci-cards there is no way of having similar identification.
If for some reason I need to change the positions of pci-nics within the
box, I will allmost certainly need to fix my init-scripts.
