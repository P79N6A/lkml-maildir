It is not necessary to setup a central repository.
We need a reference archive to keep in sync with; then everybody branches
from there and syncs back and forth. The reference archive would be the
official kernel branch.
You could then have public archives to share your patchsets. And access 
other's archives who you are interested in staying in sync with.

We only need to update to the latest kernel to have the repository
updated, nothing else. You commit the patchset as "patch-2.5.6" and that's
it. Then you grep you kernel25--rik and apply the changes from the
official branch automatically, reconciling differences. Once you want to 
"export" your changes to Linus, you export it in one or more patchsets.

It seems obvious that bitkeeper is in very good shape; I'm not at all
against people using, but I'm sure that if a few people tried arch, they'd 
be gratefully surprised. Testing and improvement is needed and very 
welcome as well as kernel hackers aiming to try it.
