As a conclusion to this, I followed Jens' advice and bought a new $28 
CD-ROM drive (talk about your "no-name" drive - this thing doesn't have 
any information other than "Made in China" - it's detected as a "CD-ROM 
Drive/G6D") which works just fine and even does DMA. The Pioneer 24X is 
going in the trash.
