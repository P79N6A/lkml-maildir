Subject: [RFC] [PATCH 2.6.21.5] ppp: fix osize too small errors when decoding mppe
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/20/96

The mppe_decompress() function required a buffer that is 1 byte too small when
receiving a message of mru size. This fixes buffer allocation to prevent this
from occurring.

As Sergey Vlasov pointed out, ppp_mppe-account-for-osize-too-small-errors-in.patch
may cause buffer overflows on certain data. Here is another patch that should
eliminate the "osize too small" errors. Instead of patching mppe_decompress
itself, I have patched ppp_decompress_frame so it would allocate the required
extra byte when using mppe compression.
I didn't have a chance to check this patch carefully yet, but it seem to be
working as expected. Any comments would be greatly appreciated.
