What about adding a member to ff_effect which would be the number of the motor?
We can't change the layout of ff_effect too much though, so we have to
find unused bits and put them to work.
For instance, we could replace
__u16 type;
by
__u8 motor;
__u8 type;
since 16 bits seems way more than needed for the effect type.
Another possibility is to get rid of "trigger" and replace it by __u8
motor and some padding, since that's I-Force specific (are there other
drivers that implement that?). The goal of "trigger" is to start an
effect when a button is pressed, which can be done from userland
instead. It's not like we need micro-second latency when starting
effects.
As a reminder, here is the current definition of ff_effect:
struct ff_effect {
       __u16 type;
       __s16 id;
       __u16 direction;
       struct ff_trigger trigger;
       struct ff_replay replay;
       union {
               struct ff_constant_effect constant;
               struct ff_ramp_effect ramp;
               struct ff_periodic_effect periodic;
               struct ff_condition_effect condition[2]; /* One for each axis */
               struct ff_rumble_effect rumble;
       } u;
};
