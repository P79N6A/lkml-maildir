Yeah, years ago when I was adding devfs calls. I've tried to forget
about it since then...

I'm actually not that concerned about performance for this case,
because it's not a common operation. If we had some kind of loop
driver that supported partitioning then I'd be satisfied. In fact, I
agree that would probably be better.
What I object to is the removal of a feature that people depend on,
*without a replacement being made available prior to removal*. If you
want to remove a feature, build the replacement *first*. Don't remove
the feature and say "the rest of you can pick up the pieces".
