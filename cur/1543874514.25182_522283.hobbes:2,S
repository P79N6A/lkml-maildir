I do not see this one - but then I do not build the -mm tree.
Will chase it later if no-one beats me.

I took a look at this one.
You have SPARSEMEM enabled in your config.
And then I see that in sparse.c we call alloc_bootmem_node()
from a function I thought should be marked __devinit (it
is used by memory_hotplug.c).
But I am not familiar enough to judge if __alloc_bootmen_node
are marked correct with __init or __devinit (to say
this is used in the HOTPLUG case) is more correct.
Anyone?

Same as above....

This one I have also tried to track down. But my
slab knowledge was not enough to fix it :-(
