Subject: [PATCH] Memory leak in ipchains

Greetings.
My apologies if this has already been posted.
I've recently had a machine crash due to an appearant lack of memory. The
nature of this problem lead us to look for a memory leak in the kernel,
and we found a bug in the ipchains firewalling code. This doesn't affect
normal operation of most sites, but does cause the kernel to allocate one
100-byte buffer[1] (128-byte slab?) that is never freed again, every time
a rule is deleted using IP_FW_DELETE.
To reproduce, simply use the ipchains(8) utility to create a rule in any
firewall chain, then delete it again (by rule, not by number). Looking at
/proc/slabinfo before and after will show one additional size-128 block
being allocated every time. Repeat this 32 times, and the output of
free(1) or /proc/meminfo should also report 4k less memory free. Now
repeat at will, or until the box crashes. :)
The bug is caused by the code that handles IP_FW_DELETE requests. It
calls convert_ipfw(), which allocates and returns a new block of data,
that is used later in del_rule_from_chain() to compare and find the
matching rule. The rule itself is deleted from the chain and freed
properly, but the temporary ip_fwkern is not.
The patch is fairly simple:

+++ linux/net/ipv4/ip_fw.c	Tue May 25 19:07:05 1999
