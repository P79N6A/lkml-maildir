If you look at the archives, there have been a *lot* of people saying 
very much the same thing as you.  I suspect people are getting tired of 
giving the same responses all the time.
Here is what Linus had to say about it a while back:
    If people in the open-source SCM community wake up and notice that
    the current open-source SCM systems aren't cutting it, that's _good_.
    But it's absolutely NOT an excuse to use them today.  Sorry.  I use
    CVS at work, and I could never use it for Linux.  I took a look at
    subversion, and it doesn't even come close to what I wanted.
    And I personally refuse to use inferior tools because of ideology. In
    fact, I will go as far as saying that making excuses for bad tools
    due to ideology is _stupid_, and people who do that think with their
    gonads, not their brains.
