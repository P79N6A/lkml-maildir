Not my problem  <grin>
People shouldn't be tuning max_sectors at the source code level: that 
just embeds the policy decisions in the source code, and leads to 
constant fiddling with the driver to get things "just right". Over time, 
disks get faster and latency falls naturally.  Thus the definition of 
"just right" must be constantly tuned in the driver source code as time 
passes.
I also wouldn't want to lock out any users who wanted to use SATA at 
full speed ;-)
