By your argument the ton of warnings we emit in various situations are 
wrong too and all should be panic()s. That argument is bogus.
Not looking at the logs makes boot problem analysis harder of course. Nor 
is your argument actually true: you can use printk_delay or any other 
method. Or you can use the VGA console and use shift-pageup ...
