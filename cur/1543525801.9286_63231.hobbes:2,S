I mean the application _always_ seems to crash at the same place (if it
crashes).
Even after a reboot.
Once the application starts crashing it always crashes until I reboot.
Netscape and emacs sometimes don't crash immediately after reboot, they do
eventually
and after the first time they always crash.

Test 1:
Running four md5sum's on the same file (168 Mb) at the same time, they all give
the
same result. (same time means the time it takes to put the mouse over another
window and press enter ~< 0.5s)
Wait a couple of seconds, and rerun the four md5sum's on the same file. They all
give
the same result but it's different from the one in the first run.
Each time I do another run they all give the same result but it usually is
different
from the previous one.
Test 2:
Running one md5sum on the same file up to nine times, one after the other, I
always
got the same result.
