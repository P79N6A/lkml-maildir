yeah, very much agreed. For example the paravirtualization/accelerator 
downcalls/upcalls in KVM dont exist yet, so there's little to 
standardize. Once we see it from lhype & KVM how these things look like 
we can design a sane kernel interface around it. But i'm against the 
notion that KVM is 'just' a device. It's not, and it /will/ grow into 
something fundamental.

yeah. I'd suggest merging it as-is into v2.6.20. In a year we'll have 
some real APIs to think about.
