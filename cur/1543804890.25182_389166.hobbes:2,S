If you google "mac os x swap partition", you'll find benchmarks from
several years ago. (Although, those benchmarks are with a partition
dedicated to the dynamically created swap files. It does more or less
ensure that the files are contiguous though.) Mac OS X was *much* more
of a dog back then, in terms of performance, so I don't know how
relevant those benchmarks are nowadays, but it might be a starting
point for answering your question.
