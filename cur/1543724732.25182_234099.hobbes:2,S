Hi,

Normal use (logging in, browsing, playing video with mplayer, moving 
windows around, etc):

2ms non-preemptible critical section violated 1 ms preempt threshold 
starting at dnotify_parent+0x27/0xc0 and ending at dnotify_parent+0x85/0xc0
2ms non-preemptible critical section violated 1 ms preempt threshold 
starting at buffered_rmqueue+0xea/0x190 and ending at 
buffered_rmqueue+0x144/0x190
What I've excluded (happens all the time):
1) 2ms non-preemptible critical section violated 1 ms preempt threshold 
starting at schedule+0x36/0x480 and ending at do_IRQ+0xec/0x130
it's 2ms 98%. This really happens all the time. Bogus?
2) 49ms non-preemptible critical section violated 1 ms preempt threshold 
starting at sys_ioctl+0x42/0x270 and ending at sys_ioctl+0xbd/0x270
40-50 ms most of the time, 12 ms couple of times.
Let me now if you need those traces for some of these (I've built kernel 
with 8K stacks).
