Probing vmalloc faults is _really_ tricky : it also implies that the
handler (let's call it probe) connected to the probe point (marker or
kprobe) should _never_ cause a vmalloc page fault, it should therefore
never touch vmalloc'd memory, which is a very restrictive constraint,
especially for tracing which may need large buffers (the only sane
alternative is to allocate the buffers statically before the kernel
boots).
As for the location of the probe point, we have to determine how we want
to handle a OOPSing probe. If we put the probe point too soon in the
do_page_fault function, we will end up doing recursive page_fault rather
than a OOPS, which may make things harder to debug.
In the LTTng instrumentation, I volountarily excluded the
bad_area and bad_area_nosemaphore paths from the page fault
instrumentation for this exact reason.
Currently, I have markers around the handle_mm_fault call :
        trace_mark(kernel_arch_trap_entry, "trap_id %d ip #p%ld",
                14, instruction_pointer(regs));
        fault = handle_mm_fault(mm, vma, address, write);
        trace_mark(kernel_arch_trap_exit, MARK_NOARGS);
I also instrument handle_mm_fault, but I leave these markers in
do_page_fault to get the architecture specific trap id (the "trap_entry"
and "trap_exit" events) and the instruction pointer causing the fault.
My handle_mm_fault instrumentation :
(note that handle_mm_fault is also called by get_user_pages, not only
do_page_fault)
int handle_mm_fault(struct mm_struct *mm, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
                unsigned long address, int write_access)
{
        int res;
        pgd_t *pgd;
        pud_t *pud;
        pmd_t *pmd;
        pte_t *pte;
        trace_mark(mm_handle_fault_entry,
                "address %lu ip #p%ld write_access %d",
                address, KSTK_EIP(current), write_access);
        __set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
        count_vm_event(PGFAULT);
        if (unlikely(is_vm_hugetlb_page(vma))) {
                res = hugetlb_fault(mm, vma, address, write_access);
                goto end;
        }
        pgd = pgd_offset(mm, address);
        pud = pud_alloc(mm, pgd, address);
        if (!pud) {
                res = VM_FAULT_OOM;
                goto end;
        }
        pmd = pmd_alloc(mm, pud, address);
        if (!pmd) {
                res = VM_FAULT_OOM;
                goto end;
        }
        pte = pte_alloc_map(mm, pmd, address);
        if (!pte) {
                res = VM_FAULT_OOM;
                goto end;
        }
        res = handle_pte_fault(mm, vma, address, pte, pmd, write_access);
end:
        trace_mark(mm_handle_fault_exit, MARK_NOARGS);
        return res;
