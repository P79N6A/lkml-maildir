devfs is based on a completely bogus idea: that a device driver is a
kernel thing.  *THIS* is the supreme fallacy, and a major pitfall for
Linux today.  devfs in fact helps perpetualize this problem, in large
part by moving policy into the kernel that has no business being there. 
It's the DOS way of fixing things -- quick, dirty, and extremely
short-sighted.
