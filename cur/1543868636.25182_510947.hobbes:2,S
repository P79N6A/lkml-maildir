Yes, it definitely can be changed.

That's why my patch computes the minimum value every time the 
GET_RESERVED_SIZE ioctl runs -- in case max_sectors has changed.
If the user decides to increase max_sectors, then the reserved_size can be 
increased immediately afterward.  This shouldn't cause any problems.
I will submit a revised patch shortly, on the linux-scsi list.
