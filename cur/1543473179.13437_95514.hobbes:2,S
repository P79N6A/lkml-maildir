I'm very impressed with the latest kernels.  2.1.132, in particular,
seems much faster than anything I've played with so far.  But (you knew
there was a but, right?) I have an anomaly in the cpu detection and
identification.  My system is RedHat 5.2 with all updates, and things
are updated as documented in Changes.  My cpu is an AMD K6-2/350.
Everything seems fine except I don't get the 3dnow flag as expected in
/proc/cpuinfo.  Other than AMD not telling me the truth, is there any
reason for this?
