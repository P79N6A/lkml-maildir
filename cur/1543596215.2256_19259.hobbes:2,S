Again, I"m working on converting a module from 2.2 to being
compatible with 2.4.
In the 2.2 version it uses wait_queue structs with function
calls such as wake_up(), interruptible_sleep_on()...
In 2.4 these have changed to accept wait_queue_head_t's.
What is the correct way to convert to the new way of doing things?
And on another note, what is the best way to debug a module that
crashes in an interrupt routine? (the oops info doesn't get logged
anywhere since it crashes in the ISR).
