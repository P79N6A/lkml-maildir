Yes will do.
Also I realized that vfspnode_lock just added more complexity because
all it protected was already protected by vfsmount_lock. So I am
cleaning up that lock.

In the patch #6 MS_MOVE and pivot_root are handled.

Yes it is safe and it is not releasing the last reference to the mount.
Will put in a comment there.
It is releasing a reference to source mount of the bind operation.
static void inline clean_propagation_reference(struct vfsmount *mnt)
+{
+	struct vfsmount *p;
+	for (p = mnt; p; p = next_mnt(p, mnt))
+		if (p->mnt_master)
+			mntput(p->mnt_master);
+}

ok will add a comment. 
but propagate_abort_mount() is not holding vfsmount_lock,  
it is holding vfspnode_lock. So there should be a problem. But as
mentioned earlier, even the need for vfspnode_lock is not needed.

can be done. will do.
