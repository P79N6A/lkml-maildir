I now think the base default should be a wrapper around the counting
semaphores, because that is the easiest path (they already exist) and it's
also the fastest path on some platforms.
But I want to be able to override the implementation on such as FRV because I
can do a better mutex than a counting semaphore there as I only have SWAP
available as an atomic op.
However, I would like to make the unconditional-exchange mutex a template that
can be overridden so that other archs can use it with one Kconfig option and a
few #defines in asm/system.h.
