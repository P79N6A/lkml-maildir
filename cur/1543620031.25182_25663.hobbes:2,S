It's because either distributor's send thread isn't woken up and at
pthread_cond_broadcast() or it's not at pthread_cond_wait() because
receiving process is not receiving it's data because of CPU time starvation.
Thus receiving "CPU hog" process is losing blocks of data.
Data path basically is:
1) read() data from soundcard
2) pthread_cond_broadcast() it
3) pthread_cond_wait() returns		| there are N of these
4) write() data to tcp socket		|
5) read() data from tcp socket
6) pthread_cond_broadcast() it
7) pthread_cond_wait() returns		| there are N of these
8) write() data to unix socket		| (here the loss probably happens)
9) read() data from unix socket		| there are N of these
10) do some CPU hog stuff		| (this process doesn't get all
11) write() results to tcp socket	| of the data)
12) read() results from tcp socket			| ...and N of these
13) scale data for drawing to screen			|
14) do a bit system-cpu-time hog drawing to screen	|
