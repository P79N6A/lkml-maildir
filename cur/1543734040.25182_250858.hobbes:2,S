Thanks a lot, the patches 1-5 you've posted look good to me (aside from
some spaces instead of tab in the asm-arm 3/5), and should save me from
my silly race.
If we'd had these earlier, we could have avoiding changing page->count
and page->mapcount over to start from -1 (though I dare say they may
be slightly more efficient as they now are, than if we converted them
back).  Should save making such conversions in future, anyway.

I was wrong when I said that: asm-arm/atomic.h has recently been reworked,
but does still needs your additions: sorry for the confusion.
Thanks,
Hugh
