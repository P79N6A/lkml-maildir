Unless something has changed seriously in just a few years, the name CDFS
was always just a Microsoft synonym for the proper name iso9660. The Linux
name CDFS is the filesystem which Randy pointed you at, for mounting
multi-session CDs and accessing individual sessions as files (iso images).
So, if you have what Microsoft calls CDFS then it is simply iso9660 and if 
it doesn't mount then either your CD is damaged (and you only get a false 
"impression" of it working in Windows) or there is a bug in Linux iso9660 
implementation. What are the error messages you get when you try to mount 
it as an iso9660?
(You didn't forget to compile Joliet and RR extensions into your kernel, 
did you?)
Kind regards
