this thing has to be /fast/ in the common path. I dont really see the 
point in spreading out allocations like that for small objects. Access 
to the object has to be refcounted /anyway/ due to scanning. Just move 
that refcounting to the object freeing stage. Keep freed-but-used 
buffers in some sort of per-CPU list that the scanning code flushes 
after it's done. (Also maybe hold the cache_chain_mutex to prevent slab 
caches from being destroyed during scanning.)

i dont see the problem. By having the pointer we have access to the 
memleak descriptor too.

the pretty horrible locking dependencies in the current one are just as 
bad. (which could be softened by a simplified allocator - but that 
brings in other problems, which problems can only be solved via 
allocator complexity ...)
If 'unification' means global locking and bad overhead and leak 
descriptor maintainance complexity then yes, we very much dont want to 
treat them in a unified way. Unless there's some killer counter-argument 
against embedding the memleak descriptor in the object that we allocate 
it is pretty much a must.
btw., you made the argument before that what matters most is the SLAB 
allocator. (when i argued that we might want to extend this to other 
allocators as well) You cant have it both ways :)

by 'global hash' i mean the current code.

i think you are trying to clinge to a bad design detail. You spent time 
on it, and that time was still worthwile, believe me. I often change 
design details dozens of times before a patch hits lkml. It doesnt 
matter, really - it's the path you walk that matters. This thing /has/ 
to be fast/scalable to be used in distributions.

lets forget you ever said this, ok? ;-)
