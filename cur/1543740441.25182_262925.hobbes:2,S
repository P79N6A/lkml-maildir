Andrea and John had similar concern.

I think ifdef would start to look messy in that function.  This one
simply rechecks permissions if the policy has changed.  Look OK?
Doing access control checks with rq_lock held can cause deadlock when
audit messages are created (via printk or audit infrastructure) which
trigger a wakeup and deadlock, as noted by both SELinux and SubDomain
folks.  This patch will let the security checks happen w/out lock held,
then re-sample the p->policy in case it was raced.  Originally from
John Johansen <johansen@immunix.com>, bits redone by me.
