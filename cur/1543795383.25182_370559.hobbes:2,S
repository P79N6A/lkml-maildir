Performance perceived by cloners is helped by
    $ mkdir -p .git/pack-cache
    $ git-rev-list --objects --all | git-pack-objects .git/pack-cache/pack
on the server side.  This exact example of preparing by the
repository maintainer is optimizing for a wrong case, and I do
not think it is worth doing in practice, but this will give you
the lower bound when server side cache is implemented to do it
on demand.
