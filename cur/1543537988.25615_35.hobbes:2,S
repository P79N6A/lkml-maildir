I've tried ide hot swap on drives I don't care about with main boards I
didn't care about.  I've had very good luck with this.  I have a netboot
machine that's used for this type of thing.  Boot it up, there's no IDE
drive attached.  Attach ide drive, load ide modules, ide drive shows up.
My laptop has a hotswap bay that can hold the floppy, cdrom, hdd, battery.
(typical, right?)  It shouldn't need waking up for it, but then again, I've
never tried it since the boot drive is ide.
