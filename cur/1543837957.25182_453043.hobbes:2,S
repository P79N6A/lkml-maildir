Yep. Socket allocations end up with alloc_skb() which is essentialy the
same as what is being done for receiving path skbs.
If you really want to separate critical from non-critical sockets, it is
much better not to play with alloc_skb() but directly forbid it in
appropriate socket allocation function like sock_alloc_send_skb().
What I suggested in previous e-mail is to separate networking
allocations from other system allocations, so problem in main allocator
and it's OOM would never affect network path.
