Of course near-total annihilation of bkbits.net may not be acceptable to
the community, but still it should work as a proof of concept.
Depending on the connect/sec of the http server (not bkbits, for the
largest part of the conversation I couldn't know about the http server,
Larry only mentioned the bkbits.net clone until recently), the
"reservation" margin will have to change: the less connect/sec the
smaller margin Larry will need to reserve, the more connect/sec the
bigger marging will be necessary.
