Subject: [PATCH]change 'struct device' -> platform_data to firmware_data

Hi,
struct device->platform_data is designed for ACPI, BIOS or other
platform specific data, but some drivers misused the field which makes
adding ACPI handle in device core impossible. Greg suggested me changing
the name of the filed and so it breaks all such drivers, and then fix
them. I'll try to fix some, but it would be great if the driver authors
could do it.
Thanks,
Shaohua
