Hi,
on heavy load the via-rhine driver locks up. Even reloading the module
doesn't help, only reboot cures the problem.
I've set the debug variable in via-rhine.c to 7 and loaded the module
without options. In the kernel log I see:
via_rhine_rx() status is 00409700.
It still does interrupts and queues packets to send, but it either doesn't
send them or doesn't receive anything.
Who can help?
Thanks,
hjb
