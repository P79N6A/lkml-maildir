Seems all the good network stuff gets discussed on l-k instead ;-<

This should be resolved by a patch i am about to submit based on the OLS
talk.
netif_rx() now returns a value which tells you the congestion levels when
you give it a packet (change from void netif_rx())
--- 
/*      return values:
 *      BLG_CNG_NONE    (no congestion)           
 *      BLG_CNG_LOW     (low congestion) 
 *      BLG_CNG_MOD     (moderate congestion)
 *      BLG_CNG_HIGH    (high congestion) 
 *      BLG_CNG_DROP    (packet was dropped)
 */

This might screw things a bit. Can you defer to say first call
netif_rx() then acknowledge or is this hard-coded into the f/ware?

I think this would make it a little more complex than necessary; the queue
state might change right after you return from netif_would_drop() -- maybe
not, i am just hypothesizing. 
** You can still create the netif_would_drop() --it just sounds too
expensive to me since to be realy sure no packet of yours is dropped, you
have to make this call for every packet.
If you cant defer the acknowledgement until netif_rx() returns then what
we could do is instead: 
1) for devices that are registered with hardware flow control
==> you have to register as a CONFIG_NET_HW_FLOWCONTROL device.
a) to let them queue that last packet before they are shut-up, the
assumption is they respect the protocol and will 'back-off' after
that. 
b) return BLG_CNG_WOULD_DROP instead to the device and give it the
responsibility to free the skb or store it wherever it wants but not in
the backlog.
I personally prefer a). Reason: If we have done all the work so
far(context switch etc) and we know the device is well behaved(meaning it
is not going to send another packet without beiong told things are fine) 
then it is probably wiser to just let that packet get on the backlog
queue.
