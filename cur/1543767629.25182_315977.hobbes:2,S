Well no - it's being migrated over to use tty_sem.  We shouldn't start
heading in the reverse direction.  Plus your patch reverts part of
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/diffs/drivers/char/tty_io.c@1.156?nav=index.html
|src/|src/drivers|src/drivers/char|hist/drivers/char/tty_io.c
in ways which might be unsafe.

Sorry, but AFAICT all you have done is to advocate for the existing patch
without having attempted to fix this problem with tty_sem.  Please try to
come up with a tty_sem-based fix.
