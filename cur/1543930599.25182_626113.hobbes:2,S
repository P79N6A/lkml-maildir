In detail, as it unfolds and while testing variants of Tejun's code on
the hardware I have access to - none of which has this bug making it
rather trickier to help.

And as I keep pointing out but you keep ignoring - not doing it breaks
even more things, by a factor of quite a lot.

The code without the changes doesn't work either. So pick your toilet
paper.. by your argument both are toilet paper.

Which as the distro bug lists for ATAPI will tell you - aint good. Still
distro vendors can ship patches.

Linus, the kernel regresses all over the place every release. If it
didn't do that you'd never get any changes in. Your kernel would
fossilize like RHEL or SLES and you'd be spending weeks analysing each
changeset for possible side effects, or - as happens by neccessity -
adding code paths so a fix vital to one driver ceases to share core code
with another driver - to reduce regression risk. Been there, done that
and its not the way progress happens.

Have fun. I trust you'll be fixing the other 11 I think it was listed
regressions before 2.6.24  - or backing out every changeset that could be
responsible ?
No I thought not - because that wouldn't be sensible either.
