Some more macro tips for you:
If the macro contains multiple statements but must also return a value
to the caller (i.e. say it can appear on RHS of an assignment), use the:
#define foo ({ something; lastthing; })
kind of idiom. So the return value of the last statement ("lastthing;"
above) in there (obviously) becomes the return value of the whole
macro. So if you need to define an internal variable inside the macro,
and the return value of the macro should be that internal variable itself,
use the:
#define bar ({ int __mvar; __mvar = something; otherstuff; __mvar; })
kind of idiom.
Of course, if you really try to pull off the above stunts, we'll probably
ask you to go back and make that a proper function in the first place :-)
