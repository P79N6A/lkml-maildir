Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Patch series to add of_platform binding to xilinxfb
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

(resend due to mailer issues.  Apologies to anyone receiving this twice)
This patch series reworks the Xilinx framebuffer driver and then adds
an of_platform bus binding.  The of_platform bus binding is needed to use
the driver in arch/powerpc platforms.
Antonino,
Assuming there are no major issues, I'd like to get this patch series
queued up for inclusion in 2.6.24.
Thanks,
g.
