[PATCH] I2C: And yet another it87 patch.
Trivial, but important.
Somehow in the patching the bk tree somehow got two memset's to clear
new_client in it87_detect, normally while this would be bad, it would
not be critical.
However one of the two happens BEFORE the variable is set, and thus
things go badly.
