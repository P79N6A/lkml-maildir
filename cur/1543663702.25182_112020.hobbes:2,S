This just just for PTEs ... for which at the moment we have two choices:
1. Stick them in lowmem (fills up the global space too much).
2. Stick them in highmem - too much overhead doing k(un)map_atomic
   as measured by both myself and Andrew.
Using UKVA for PTEs seems to be a better way to implement pte-highmem to me.
If you're walking another processes' pagetables, you just kmap them as now,
but I think this will avoid most of the kmap'ing (if we have space for two
sets of pagetables so we can do a little bit of trickery at fork time).

The pagetables.

Sorry, subject was probably misleading ... I'm just talking about the
PTEs here, not sticking anything to do with rmap into UKVA. 
Partially object-based rmap is cool for other reasons, that have little to
do with this. ;-)
