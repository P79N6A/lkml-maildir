I measured after warming up for about a 100 times or so. It is
not a cold-cache case. I think we have a bigger problem in hand
here. I measured this with 2.6.13 and saw that I could do the
same in ~3 microseconds per iteration. It balloons to 12 microseconds
in 2.6.14-rc1. I am looking at this right now apart from the other
problems.

Even beyond the file counter issue, we do need to address the DoS
and the open/close slowdown issue.
