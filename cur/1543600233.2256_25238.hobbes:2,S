:) Okay, "lots" is relative.  If you only telnet in and exit right
away, you won't see it.

ncr885e, which I believe I am the de facto maintainer of... Dan Cox
wrote it while he was working for Synergy Microsystems.  When he quit,
I was hired to replace him.  Anyone else using this driver?  I have a
patch for it that fixes some other things (currently only in the
LinuxPPC tree) but not this.
Thanks for the help, I think this is my problem to fix now.
