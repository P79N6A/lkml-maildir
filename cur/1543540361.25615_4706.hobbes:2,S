Subject: drm doesn't work on 2.4.0-test5 with MODVERSIONS

(I sent this last night but my network is screwed at the moment
and I don't think it got through).
The agpsupport.c file in the new drm code tries to find out if 
agpgart is loaded by using the un-versioned names of the functions.
This fails if CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is set.
The quick fix is to #include <linux/modsetver.h> followed by
#include <linux/modules/agpgart.ver>*
The longer fix is probably to find a better way to check if 
the gart module is loaded, or simply make it dependent and let
modprobe take care of it.
