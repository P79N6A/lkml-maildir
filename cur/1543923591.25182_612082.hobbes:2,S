The only sane solution is the one that people constantly seem to ignore:
 - only use MMCONFIG if absolutely required by the access itself
In other words, make the MMCONFIG code fall back on old-style accesses for 
any register access to a word with reg+size <= 256.
At that point, almost all the issues with mmconfig just go away, BECAUSE 
NOBODY USES IT, so it doesn't matter if it's broken?
The fact is, CONF1 style accesses are just safer, and *work*. 
Can we please just do that?
