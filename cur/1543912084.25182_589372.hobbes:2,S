You mean "would be if it were implemented"?  Although consider the
equivalent forkbomb or thrashing userspace problems, where we just say
"use quotas".
Just to clarify: that is not how we work, we migrate tasks off a dying
CPU, breaking affinity and printing a warning if necessary.  
It was simple and has not proven problematic in practice.  (Userspace
cpu affinity has been a question of optimality not correctness)

Indeed, (1) is missing.  I would hesitate to introduce more
infrastructure in an under-worn and over-buggy part of the kernel
though.
