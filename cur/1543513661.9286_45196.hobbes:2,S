No one doubts your abilities, Donald. Most of us (myself included)
think you're great, and want to help.  So I agree, it's process.

Well, I said that it isn't as transparent as I would like, so I'll
respond with some specifics.
When I go to any of the kernel sites, I'm presented with a list of all
of the kernel versions, going back to the dark ages.  When I go to
other sites, I see the same. If I'm interested in some ac patch from
long ago, I can find it.  I see this as good.
I can get patch files from one version to another.
When I go to your 
ftp://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/linux/drivers,
 except
for 
ftp://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/linux/drivers/tulip-drivers/
 where
there's a transparent list of drivers from 1996 to the start of 1998 ,
I see a single versions of tulip.c:
v0.91 in linux/drivers
v0.91g in linux/drivers/test
v0.91u in linux/drivers/kern2.3
I, a user and a developer, have no visibility between 0.91, 0.91g and
0.91u other than the diffs I can do between them.  How can I or others
possibly help you? You make have a pool of people you test things
with, and they may have access to your CVS repository.
I'm on the tulip-driver list, but not the tulip-bug list, primarily
because I wasn't having problems with the driver, and I assumed that
tulip-driver (as the linux-kernel list does) would carry information
on new versions and other developments.  My mistake, sort of. Is there
are tulip-announce list I should also join?
Look, I'm a fan of yours.  My first post on this thread strongly
supported you.  I would like to help without turning into a
maintainer.  I have offered help to you directly, but I, a mere
developer, can't participate in your process as it stands right now. 
And that, I think, is the point others are making.
