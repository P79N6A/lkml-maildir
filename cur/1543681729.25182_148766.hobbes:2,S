This one looks *awesome* here - the base -mm1 version (which was -O5int if I
remember right) was still subject to very tiny stutters (sound like "clicks")
in xmms (everybody's favorite tester ;) under some conditions (changing folders
in the Exmh mail client was usually good for a click).  -O6int has stuttered
exactly once in the past hour, and that was with Exmh going, a large grep
running, a sudden influx of fetchmail/sendmail/procmail (probably 30-50 fork/
exec pairs/sec there), launching Mozilla (oink ;), and something else big all at the
same time (in other words, under as extreme load as this laptop ever sees in
actual production useage).
