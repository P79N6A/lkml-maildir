It is vmmon from my vmware-any-any-updates, not from VMware itself.  I use 
templates from C++ to compile same C code against different structures 
(different ABI), so you can use same vmmon module for all VMware's products.
Using templates instead of including same sources with random #define before 
looked fine at that time when kernel did not use these additional options and/or 
c++ did not complain about them.
Now it seems that I should return back to compiling same sources with different 
#defines as it seems impossible to get rid of these warnings without declaring 
own rules... (and with g++ 4.0 it now even emits incorrect warnings about using 
uninitialized struct members, which is another reason to get rid of c++ compiler 
for me).
So if I would be making decision now and not five years ago, I would not pick 
c++ templates to do the job.
