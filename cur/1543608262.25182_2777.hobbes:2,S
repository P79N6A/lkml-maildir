Hi Tim!
	Firstly: obviously, I think that work on /proc is a worthy and excellent
thing to be doing: everyone has been complaining about it since its introduction
(for good reason).
	I'm not sure about such explicit typing: see my patch (the existing types are
only for convenience: you can trivially supply your own).  I agree with the
"one file, one value" idea.  I also went for dynamic directories for those who
don't want to continually register/deregister.
I suggest you read my patch 8)
Rusty.
