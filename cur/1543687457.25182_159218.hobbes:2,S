Besides the fact that my IRQs have been re-arranged, there seems to be 
other issues as well.
I thought that if I didn't compile the alsa snd-sb16 driver, but still 
left isapnp enabled, it should not ever try to get IRQ 5 for ISA.  I'm 
not sure if that is the way the kernel works, but just disabling the 
gameport and snd-sb16 parts did not work.  It still hangs where it 
should be saying something about getting IRQ 12 for the mouse on 
2.6.0-test3-mm2 (though I disabled that too since I use a USB mouse, so 
it probably should be saying something about my keyboard port).  
However, I don't ever see that, now I just see "input:" and then the 
cursor stops blinking.  I originally had "mice" clicked but nothing else 
selected in the build menu, but after it locked up showing "input:" I 
thought I might as well knock that off too and see if it helped.  
Obviously not...
I'm recompiling without isapnp now so we'll see how that goes.  Looks 
like that affects everything, so it'll take a while. 
While I was fooling around trying to get the thing to book with mm3, I 
set my BIOS to auto, and that did change the way IRQ's were allocated 
with 2.6.0-test3-mm2.  I had just assumed since it allocated IRQs the 
same since 2.5.69 that things remained consistent between those 
kernels.  This litte test confirmed that.  As soon as I went to auto, it 
dumped an error when trying to setup the snd-sb16 driver on kernel 
2.6.0-test3-mm2.  So I changed it back to manually configured, which 
also includes IRQ's 3 and 4 btw as well as 5 and 7. 
Note that mm3 did not change it's allocation of IRQs when I set the BIOS 
to auto, so apparently it is now ignoring the BIOS.  That is definetly 
new with mm3.
