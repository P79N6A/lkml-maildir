Hi!
Thanks for a fresh air in this flamewar...

Can you test recent swsusp?

...well, thanks for your good work.

Well, at least Fedora and SuSE ship swsusp by default. So it is getting
huge ammount of testing, too.

swsusp is also available today, and works better than you think. It is slightly
slower, but has all the other
features you listed in 2.6.16-rc3.

It would hurt at least me, Andrew and Linus... It would make lot
of suspend2 users very happy...

It is less work to port suspend2's features into userspace than to make
suspend2 acceptable to mainline. Both will mean big changes, and may
cause some short-term problems, but it will be less pain than 
maintaining suspend2 forever. Please help with the former...
