Sorry for the very late reply.
I tested with 2.6.8.1(I think your patch it included there) with strange 
results.
*It works fine if I unload ipw2100 before suspend and load it later
*In single user mode with ipw2100 loaded while S3, IRQ 11 is disabled on 
resume, IRQ is not disabled
*When the system is fully booted up, everything seems to work fine.
I'll test a little bit more and report the results.
Cheers,
Stefan
