Why would binary drivers be any harder to debug than the existing binary 
kernel. If you want to debug something use the source code. My proposal 
doesn't remove the need for quality public source code but it does isolate 
the kernel components and allow for 'plugin' use on different kernels both 
old and new.
If a relatively small kernel component can be turned on/off and upgraded at 
will, without changing ANYTHING else, this would be a big step forward.
