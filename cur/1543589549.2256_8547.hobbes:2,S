Subject: 2.4.3-ac9/4 - NFS corruption

My NFS client runs 2.4.3-ac4 (SMP).
My NFS server uses user-land NFS and runs 2.4.3-ac9 (UP).
I've seens the following in my ~/mail/inbox, NFS mounted:
	^@^@^@^@^@^@est-admin@lists.sourceforge.net  Tue May  1 14:47:02 2001
On the server, the same line reads:
	From test-admin@lists.sourceforge.net  Tue May  1 14:47:02 2001
The above "^@" are NULL bytes, as displayed by "vi".
The data around those NULL bytes were perfect, i.e. there was text before
in the mailbox that was correct.
An "ls -l" on the file yields:
	-rw-------    1 ram      users     1642491 May  1 00:00 inbox
(on the server, and via NFS), which is *abnormal*, since it's 15:18 and
I've just updated the file.  Therfore, the timestamp is corrupted as well
in the inode.
If I create a file, via "> ~/mail/test" on NFS, it reads:
	-rw-r--r--    1 ram      users           0 May  1 15:19 test
with a proper timestamp.
The NFS access is done via a symlink to an NFS-mounted dir, i.e. ~/mail
is actually a symlink to /nfs/lyon/home/ram/mail.
Any hint as to what is happening?  Is that a known problem?
