   The discreprency is that get_fast_time() returns the current value of
   xtime, while do_gettimeofday() may actually calculate the time and
   consider both xtime and the jiffies.
Look at the x86 implementation of do_fast_time, it equals
do_gettimeofday() when TSC is present which is the only time
that do_gettimeofday is going to be more accurate than xtime.
Franks a lot,
