	I'm experiencing the same thing.  Problem is that the Oops occurs
so early (right after the initial Net IPv6 message) that the Oops will
have to be copied down by hand.  I don't have a serial console.
	Expect my data later today when I can take the time to recompile
the kernel with it hard linked in and blow up my workstation a few times.  :-)

	I didn't see this.  When I modprobe ipv6 is loads with no error.
