Nice to know that.

It would be a real pitty to see swim3 dropped from the kernel. Speaking
as a mere user here, that's one of the main ways that I get information
into and from the old PowerMac 9500 that I have here.
And, I don't know if this has been reported earlier, but using mtools
(say, mcopy and friends) makes the drive become unusable (I don't
remember the messages literally here, because I'm not at the front of
the computer, but I can serve as a guinea pig if needed---despite my
lack of free time).
Thanks, Rogério Brito.
