You are right, open_by_handle() is not a generic solution. However, in
my implementation of the function, I only support those filesystems
that only needs iget() to get an inode. This is even less generic.
The inode number and the iget() function forms a forced get_fh/open_fh
interface that is not working for all file systems. In *BSD, there is
a VFS_VGET function that gets a vnode when provided with a file
handle.
I'm going to continue my use of open_by_handle(), regardless of
whether it is supported either with a syscall or an internal vfs
interface. I just think it would be a good idea to put some support
for it into the kernel.
