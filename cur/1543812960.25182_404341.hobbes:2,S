input.c line 747+ was recently added and caused the error message:
[1]=>   envp[i++] = buffer + len;
[2]=>   len += snprintf(buffer + len, buffer_size - len, "MODALIAS=");
[2]=>   len += print_modalias(buffer + len, buffer_size - len, dev) + 1;
[1]=>   envp[i] = NULL;
        return 0;
[1] What is checking for enough space here?  This didn't overflow AFAICT
but it could.
[2] The snprintf() and print_modalias() calls don't check for errors and
thus don't return -ENOMEM when the buffer does fill up.  Shouldn't they
do that instead of returning a truncated env string?  Only the final
sanity test in snprintf() keeps them from overrunning the buffer.
(It was print_modalias_bits() that actually caused the overflow.)

Wasn't me, it was Horst Schirmeier <horst@schirmeier.com>
