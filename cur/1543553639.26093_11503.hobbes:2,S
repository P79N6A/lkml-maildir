Why? It's got to get kmalloc'd anyway, and code reuse is
_good_. Experiment with different names for inter_module_xxx until you
feel happier :)

The primary reason that I've often lamented its removal is for
auto-loaded sound drivers to store their mixer level on unload, in order
to reset to the same values upon being reloaded.

Strictly speaking, all the inter_module_xxx stuff should probably wait for
2.5.
