Not at all.

Yes.

No. Since now kmod is used for autoloading, not kerneld anyway.

You have kerneld in memory. Since there are no code in kernel to communicate
with kerneld anymore kerneld will not handle autoloading, kmod will. Kerneld
still doing autounloading but it's the same thing as `rmmod -a` in crontab
in setup without kerneld.
