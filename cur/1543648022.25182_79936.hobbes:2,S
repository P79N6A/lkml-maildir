I'm fairly well confused, as well.  I don't know if it's kernel, or
Evolution, or ORBit.  The Evolution people don't seem to care all that
much - it's broken, it's a development kernel, they'll straighten it out
later.  *shrug*  I don't see much point to getting a weekly email about
it, if no one's working on the problem?  I don't understand anywhere
near enough to look into it.
