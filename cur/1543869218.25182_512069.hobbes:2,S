I presume you're talking about a BSD-style ChangeLog.  I've always found 
those utterly useless, since they're basically the equivalent of SCM 
history but without any of the abilities to sort, filter, etc, thus 
making it utterly impossible to find anything.  They're a pain to 
maintain (they inherently *always* cause merge failures) and add very 
little.
