Hello, I got a problem: since several version of the kernel we can't
choose the io, irq, dma, etc... for the oss 100% compatible sound
blaster sound card, my sound card should be set on irq 5.  In kernel
version 2.3.42 my sound card is irq 5 and my net card is irq 10, but
when I try to build a kernel newer than 2.3.42 (I think that 2.3.42 is
the last one where we can choose the settings of the sound card) I got a
problem: the kernel put irq 5 on my network card and didn't detect my
sound blaster card (SB32).
How can I tell to the kernel (2.4.0) that my nic (AcerLAN ALN-101) is
irq 5 ?
I use the NE2000 driver for this one...
And how can I tell to the kernel to use irq 5 for my sb32 card ?
This is a snippet of "procinfo" for kernel version 2.3.42 and 2.4.0
Please help my cause I really need another kernel version that the old
2.3.42...
Note: 2.2.16 and 2.2.17 don't work too cause again we can't choose the
irq, dma, etc...
2.3.42:
irq  0:      5559 timer                 irq 10:        12 NE2000
irq  1:       152 keyboard           irq 11:        65 fdomain
irq  2:         0 cascade [4]         irq 12:         0 PS/2 Mouse
irq  5:         1 soundblaster       irq 13:         1 fpu
irq  6:         3                              irq 14:     49418 ide0
2.4.0:
irq  0:    579821 timer                 irq  6:         3
irq  1:      6043 keyboard            irq 11:        65 fdomain
irq  2:         0 cascade [4]           irq 12:      1220 PS/2 Mouse
irq  5:         0 NE2000                 irq 14:     77770 ide0
Thank you so much !!!
