Hi,
after reading about issues with the nics on kontron boards I did a
bios upgrade,
but this did not change anything.
However, yesterday the nic (onboard) I used died. No link at all,
after switching to
the next onboard  nic I got a NETDEV transmit timeout with that one on
kernel 2.6.22-r2.
It seems the whole thing is a hardware issue. I will try to figure out
with kontron.
Sorry :(
Karl
