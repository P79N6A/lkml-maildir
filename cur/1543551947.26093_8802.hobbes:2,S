Hello,
I have some trouble with an initrd configuration where it seems the 
wrong partition is mounted as root (/), even though it seems fine in 
/etc/fstab, and mount and df all display that it's fine.
I realized that the kernel messages are not as helpful as possible:
<4>VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
<4>change_root: old root has d_count=1
<5>Trying to unmount old root ... okay
<4>Freeing unused kernel memory: 68k freed
<6>Adding Swap: 132088k swap-space (priority -1)
It would be good if the devices involved were displayed, I mean _which_ 
filesystem was mounted or unmounted? The mount of the new root is not 
logged at all.
Regards,
Ulrich
