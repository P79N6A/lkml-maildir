I checked those patches you mentioned, they did bind two wakeup flag to
some extent, but they can't be exchanged to use and they are just partly
in current linus tree, two flags bind isn't in linus tree.
According to my test on the latest linus tree, wakeup flag of
acpi_device hasn't any association with device's, i don't know if they
are the same thing. if we enbale or disable it manually, what will
happen? From source code, it is just a flag, it doesn't trigger any
event or hardware operation.
