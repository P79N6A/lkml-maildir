Quite interesting that you found it. It was released yesterday, and I
wanted to write an announcement in a few days, at least at the Xenomai
lists. Anyway ...

Yes, that's a MOST driver for a OS 8604 PCI interface that I wrote as
Diploma Thesis at Siemens. It was relased as OpenSource just now.
It only supports synchronous data transfer. The Most NetServices are
in userspace. There's a OpenSource demonstration available, but no
full NetServices implementation. You can buy a license from SMC or use
the specification to re-write an OSS implementation. However, that's
all userspace, so no GPL problem here. :)
I must say that it was more a demonstration how a Linux driver could
be ported to real-time Linux extension than a real productive working
MOST driver for Linux.
Well, but of course, it works. At least it did in my environement
(i386/single-CPU).
You can find more information on the homepage ...
Regards,
Bernhard
PS: SUSE has nothing to do with that driver, I only write with my SUSE
address because I don't want to re-subscribe because of one mail.
