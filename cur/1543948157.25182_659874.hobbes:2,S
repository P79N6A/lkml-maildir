Thank you for your answer. However, I don't see how a user-mode task will help me print my log after a kernel panic, through SysRq? Please clarify.
What we want is essentially a replacement for printk(), where the messages are instead logged in a big ring buffer, and can be printed with Alt-SysRq-l when need be. And the problem is the actual printing of the buffer to the console, since printk() inserts its timestamp after every linebreak or 1023 characters, whichever comes first.
