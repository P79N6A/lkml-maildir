Ehm, this patch is so broken it's not even funny - did you even compile?
You would have noticed the warning on request_queue_t, surely. The big
problem is the last hunk here though, how would that work on stacked
devices? Clue: ->bi_bdev is not const, it can change after a call to
->make_request_fn().
