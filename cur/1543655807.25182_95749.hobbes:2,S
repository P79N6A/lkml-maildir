Subject: [PATCH] fix text console redrawing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I found out why the text console wasn't getting redrawn when switching
from X back to tty1.  It was because the vc->vc_font.width and .height
for tty1 had been reset to 0 by fbcon_set_display().  The font-setting
logic in there looks wrong to me, and this patch should fix it.
Without this patch, we find the first console on this fb which appears
to have valid font data and then copy the width and height *to* that
console rather than *from* that console.  This patch changes it to
copy from that console to the new console that we are initializing.
Paul.
