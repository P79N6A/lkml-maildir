Do you mean one load/store access to memory where the first and the last part
(e.g. first 2 and last 2 bytes for a 32-bit word) are to different memory types
(e.g. main RAM and video RAM on PCI)? If yes, where does that happen? If no,
can you please clarify?
(At first I thought you meant an instruction where the opcode crosses those
 two memory types, but we don't put code in video RAM...)
