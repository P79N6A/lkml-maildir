Yes, but its just make-work.  It has no bearing on what the clocksource
implementer needs to care about.  CLOCK_SOURCE_IS_CONTINUOUS is a
property of the clocksource they're implementing; it matters to them. 
But "list"?  It's just administration.

Great, so we end up with some random piece of clocksource internal
implementation detail cut-n-paste replicated all over the kernel.
