But how can it resume from a swap device for which it has no driver?
Even if you copied the needed module(s) onto the swap device, the kernel
needs the modules to be loaded before it can read anything.  The driver 
would be there if resuming happened after the initrd loaded it.  But
I wasn't able to make that actually work.
