Sorry, I didn't really explain what I meant very well.  I realise that
it's not just a case of getting the driver to compile on other
architectures, what I meant was that if the driver is open source then
anybody is free to work on the support for non-X86 boxes.  If it's
closed source, then only the manufacturer can work on it.

That's interesting, I didn't know that.  How complete is it?  Does it
just emulate a subset of X86 instructions that are enough for 90% of
initialisation code?
John.
