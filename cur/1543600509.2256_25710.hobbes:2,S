Solaris is, and has been since good ol' Solaris 2.0.  So's AIX and even more
obscure things like DG/UX.  I'd think all SysVR4 derivatives have to be, by
virtue of the SysV schedular (threads have priorities from 0 to 159; system
threads run from 60 to 99, so the schedular must be able to preempt system 
threads for the real-time threads from 100 to 159).
