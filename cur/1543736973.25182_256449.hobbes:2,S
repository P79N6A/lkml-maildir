A monitor on "/etc" will return "hosts" if hosts is modified.  Which I
think is OK--we don't pass the entire path, nor do we want to if we
could do it easily, for numerous reasons ..

This is one of the issues with dnotify we want to fix.  And to do
generic file notification, it is not just rescanning the directory but
caching file modify timestamps (say, keep all of the stat structures in
memory) and then re-stat'ing everything and comparing.  Ugh.

Agreed.

This is what inotify does. ;-)
Everything is relative to the object being watched.
