Hello,
We are PhD students at Stanford University working on a static analysis 
project called SATURN (
http://glide.stanford.edu/saturn
). We have 
implemented a checker that finds potential null dereference errors and 
ran our tool on the kernel version 2.6.17.1. We have identified around 
300 potential issues related to null errors, and we've included 20 
sample reports below. If you would be interested, we can post all the 
issues we found. Also, we apologize in advance if we aren't supposed to 
post these error reports here, and we are happy to submit bug reports 
elsewhere if you tell us where to post these.
Thanks,
Thomas & Isil Dillig
