Ok, I wondered what the intent really was.

Using a flag should be enough I think:
#define CRAMFS_FLAG_FSID_EDITION_IS_TIMESTAMP  0x00000004 /* edition field
used as timestamp */
And mkcramfs should perhaps have support for
-e timestamp
(the string timestamp) which would set the edition field to the timestamp
according to the files in the image and set the timestamp flag.
Perhaps another option to set the timestamp flag but use whatever number
is supplied in the -e option might be useful for some, although I personally
don't think I need it. E.g. -f FSID_EDITION_IS_TIMESTAMP
Another mkcramfs feature we have at Axis is the support for metafiles with
file info used when creating the image. That allows us to create device
nodes, change userid etc. without being root which is good when building
for embedded devices.
It was first posted in October last year but without any feedback:

What do you think about that?
