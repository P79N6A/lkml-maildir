A big no-no, IMHO. Linux is a UNIX like system. I like Linux, I like UNIX.
And I want my UNIX to ONLY do what I would like. If I say that there's
an SB Live, and compile&install ALSA/OSS/whatever for sound card, it's right.
If my OS want to do it without any request by me it's wrong! Hey this is
not a child-toy, it's Linux. IMHO.
