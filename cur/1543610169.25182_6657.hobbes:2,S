There is something to that.  I've mostly been in maintenance mode.
And tackling other things.  For what is worth I can currently
boot memtest86 and etherboot, besides the linux kernel.

Hmm.  I will have to look.  I haven't had problems with it myself.
So I don't know what to say.
I'm not quite ready to do a whole lot on the maintenance side until
I finish working through my design issues.  But as soon as that
is completed I will make certain something is going on.
You might want to link to the linuxBIOS site.  
http://www.linuxbios.org
As that is related.  But I guess not directly useful.
