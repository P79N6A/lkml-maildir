Hi.
These are patches that I've been testing.
They survived my test(rmdir aftre task move under memory pressure
and page migration) w/o big problem(except oom) for hours
in both use_hierarchy==0/1 case.
I want them go in 2.6.29.
They are based on mmotm-2009-01-05-12-50.
[1/4] fix for mem_cgroup_get_reclaim_stat_from_page
[2/4] fix error path of mem_cgroup_move_parent
[3/4] fix for mem_cgroup_hierarchical_reclaim
[4/4] make oom less frequently
I think 1 and 2 are ok.
I'll update them based on comments.
Thanks,
Daisuke Nishimura.
