A simple perl hack that takes a list of files and greps them for CONFIG_,
each found is put in a hashtable of valid defines. Then search all *.[chS]
files for CONFIG_ and if not in the hash it is printed.
Is that anything like what you had in mind?
% ./cfg-scan.pl `find /usr/src/linux/ -name '*onfig.in'` 
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/autoconf.h /usr/src/linux/.config
gives, on ac7:
/usr/src/linux/fs/locks.c: CONFIG_LOCK_MANDATORY
/usr/src/linux/fs/proc/root.c: CONFIG_SUN_OPENPROMFS_MODULE
/usr/src/linux/fs/proc/root.c: CONFIG_SUN_OPENPROMFS_MODULE
...
That will find a lot of bogus errors where people have used CONFIG_ for
their own defines, or things in comments.
And it is not a short list ... 1555
(with duplicates, and possibly incomplete "valid" list).
Btw, how do you count to 565 "legal" CONFIG_'s?
