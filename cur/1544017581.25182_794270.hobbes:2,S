Hi Nick,

I was trying to bisect a somewhat recent SLAB vs. SLUB regression in
tbench that seems to be triggered by CONFIG_SLUB as suggested by Evgeniy
Polyakov performance tests. Unfortunately I bisected it down to a bogus
commit so while I saw SLUB beating SLAB, I also saw the reverse in
nearby commits which didn't touch anything interesting. So for tbench,
SLUB _used to_ dominate SLAB on my machine but the current situation is
not as clear with all the tbench regressions in other subsystems.
SLUB has been a consistent winner for hackbench after Christoph fixed
the regression reported by Ingo Molnar two years (?) ago. I don't think
I've ran netperf, but for the fio test you mentioned, SLUB is beating
SLAB here.

2-way Core2. I posted my /proc/cpuinfo in this thread if you're
interested.

Yeah but I say that we don't know _why_ it's better. There's the
kmalloc()/kfree() CPU ping-pong hypothesis but it could also be due to
page allocator interaction or just a plain bug in SLUB. And lets not
forget bad interaction with some random subsystem (SCSI, for example).

Again, it's not that I don't take the OLTP regression seriously (I do)
but as a "part-time maintainer" I simply don't have the time and
resources to attempt to fix it without either (a) being able to
reproduce the problem or (b) have someone who can reproduce it who is
willing to do oprofile and so on.
So as much as I would have preferred that you had at least attempted to
fix SLUB, I'm more than happy that we have a very active developer
working on the problem now. I mean, I don't really care which allocator
we decide to go forward with, if all the relevant regressions are dealt
with.
All I am saying is that I don't like how we're fixing a performance bug
with a shiny new allocator without a credible explanation why the
current approach is not fixable.

So now the HPC folk will be screwed over by the OLTP folk? I guess
that's okay as the latter have been treated rather badly for the past
two years.... ;-)
