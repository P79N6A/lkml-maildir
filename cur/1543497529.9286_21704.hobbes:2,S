i just want to note that there might be a slight bias on this list
that makes it appear that this "total lockup" problem started in
2.2.9; a result of many of its readers staying on the leading edge (as
opposed to 2.3.X: the bleeding edge).
i haven't moved up from 2.2.7 yet, and i strongly suspect that the
total lockups i see at least once a day on my dual PII-450 with an
adaptec 2940 SCSI adapter (on the MB) are the same thing as Thiery and
others are reporting.
so, if you start digging, don't start with 2.2.9.
