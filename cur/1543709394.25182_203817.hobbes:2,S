you're aware of Dominik/Bruno's work on the 'acpilib'[1] stuff in this
area right ? We'll need that anyway for Powernow-k7 and maybe longhaul too
and its senseless duplicating this code.
One thing is bugging me though. Whats wrong with the ACPI P-state cpufreq
driver ? Does that not work these days ? It's been a long time since I
even looked at it.
