First off, not all tests are good tests. In particular, small timing
differences can get magnified horrendously by heading into swap.
That said, do you have the means and standard deviations of those
runs? That's a good way to tell whether the tests are converging or
not, and whether your results are telling you anything.
Also as you're on a uniprocessor system, make -j2 is probably going to
be faster than make -j3. Perhaps immaterial to whatever you're trying
to test, but there you go.
