I do not think so. This comes up from time to time, and some people have
talked about attempting a port, but no one is doing so at this point
that I have heard of. The old Powerstations like the one you mention are
all microchannel based, which is probably part of the problem. The other
part is probably lack of documentation on the rest of the hardware.
Cheers,
Chris
