what do you think about the PREEMPT_REALTIME stuff in -T4? Ideally, if
you agree with the generic approach, the next step would be to add your
priority inheritance handling code to Linux semaphores and
rw-semaphores. The sched.c bits for that looked pretty straightforward.
The list walking is a bit ugly but probably unavoidable - the only other
option would be 100 priority queues per semaphore -> yuck.
