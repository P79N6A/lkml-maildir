"PS" is 2.4.18-pre3 + sched H6 + preempt
With PS I got somewhere in between O1 and LL, which means that desktop
performance under load with "nice -n +19 make bzimage" (audiovisual
xmms plugins, tuxracer, Q3A, mozilla) were best smooth with LL, and a
little worse with PS.
With "nice -n 0 make bzimage" desktop interactivity was best with PS,
a little worse with O1 and worst with LL.
If I get enough free time, I will test O1+preempt versus O1+mini-ll.
Something tells me that best results will be with O1+LL, because in LL
versus preempt, LL wins for me (interactivity, smoothness).
