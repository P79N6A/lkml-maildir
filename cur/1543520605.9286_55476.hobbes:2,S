Or the author is smart.. which is the case. The patch changes the ring 3 
code segment descriptor to limit below the stack. Executing code on the stack
traps via a trampoline detector. It works rather nicely considering the limits
the CPU imposes.
On sane machines the kernel does not need to be involved - you can do non
executable stack simply by fixing ld.so and glibc a little on many platforms
