I wouldn't try to reroute the system calls but rather write trivial
drivers
using a file for example as the "hardware" for the root partition. This
wouldn't
be that ugly.

Yes this would need a bit of more consideration. However I'm quite sure
that
it could be done y just reserving a sufficiently bit are of shm and
doing all
them memmory management upon this should be possible, since even the 
normal kernel does provide much of this by plain software instead of
using the
proessors hardware for this....
