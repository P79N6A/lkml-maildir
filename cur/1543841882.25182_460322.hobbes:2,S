Russell might have tested it on an Integrator/AP (not sure
though). IIRC, I tested the e100.c driver on this platform with 2.6.12
and it was OK at that time (the platform is now discontinued by ARM
Ltd).

I tested the e100.c driver a few months ago on the Versatile/PB and
RealView/EB platforms with PCI backplanes attached. The driver seemed
to work well (after fixing some PCI hardware problems on our
platforms). I couldn't get the eepro100.c driver to work though, but
didn't have any reason to investigate further.
