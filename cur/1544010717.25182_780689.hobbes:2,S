From the iostat, the log file write latency is 1.62ms. DBMD has stats for log file write of 2.17ms, that is including latency of io_submit, physical i/o and io_getevents.

Since I don't have access to the source code, I cannot make the about change to the foreground or log writer.

Yes. If we only look at the timestamp in just one foreground process. The reported log latency is an average of the sum of all foreground stats. Since this average went down with the log writer set to SCHED_RR, I took that as log writer get to do its job sooner.
