I forgot it. If you just want to power-off:
- activate APM in the BIOS
- activate APM in kernel
I have an SMP box, so APM does not work fully, but just power-off works.
So if for any reason you box says is not capable of doing APM, add this
to lilo.conf:
append="apm=power-off"
so at least this will work.
