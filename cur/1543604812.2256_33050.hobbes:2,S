   I've attached a fragment of tcpdump output from the middle of steady
   state transfer. Looking at the dump, it seems that most arriving
   segments have the PSH bit set. This leads me to believe that the
   transfer is mostly application limited at the sender side.
This means the application is doing many small writes.  To be honest,
to only sure way to cure any performance problems from that is to
fix the application in question.  What is this application?
Franks a lot,
