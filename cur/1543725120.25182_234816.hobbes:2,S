It's fine with me, as long as you move it to an arch specific header at the 
same time (i.e. don't functionally change it while you move code around).

Yeah, that's what I had in mind.  I'll wait for the patch you mentioned above 
and hack on top of that...
For sn2 at least, there are quite a few ways we could dice up the topology.  
We'll have to experiment with things a bit to find some good defaults.
