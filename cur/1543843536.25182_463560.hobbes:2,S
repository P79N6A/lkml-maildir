Yes, but unfortunately marking the lock as 'can-be-taken-multiple-times' 
is weaker than using the nested locking provided by lockdep.
i.e. if you mark a lock this way, it opens door for having deadlock, which 
won't be detected by lockdep. This will happen if the code, by mistake, 
really takes the _very same_ lock twice. lockdep will not be able to 
detect this, when the lock is marked in a way you propose, but is able to 
detect this when using the nested semantics.
