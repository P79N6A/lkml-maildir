TSC timer is useless and the kernel can't seem to find the hpet, unfortunately 
nosmp doesn't even boot so that workaround is blocked too.
Trying to go through this problem some more, I would have to agree that it 
could be the sata_nv interrupts that are throwing off the time, but what I 
don't seem to understand is how the pmtimer would persist at this new 
interrupt rate of 700/s even after sata_nv interrupts drop off.
