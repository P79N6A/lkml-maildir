Vaguely.  It never hurts to repeat things ;)

yes.
filemap_nopage isn't the right place to be doing these things though.
Given that there was no page at the virtual address before filemap_nopage
was called I don't think any CPU cache writeback or invalidation need be
performed.  Perhaps a writeback or invalidate is missing somewhere in the
unmap paths, or there is a problem in arch/arm somewhere.
We have a no-op flush_icache_page() in do_no_page(), but I don't know what
that thing ever did, not what it's doing in there.  (What happens if you
replace it with a flush_cache_page(vma, address)?)
Someone who understands these things better than I is going to have to work
out where the bug really is, I'm afraid.
