Looking at the source for Linux 2.2.8 and a pre-release procps,
I don't see how this could happen. Several glibc "features" have
messed up ps in the past (like not following standards), but I
don't have the source for that.
You could try a new procps, either from Debian's unstable branch
or from 
http://www.cs.uml.edu/~acahalan/linux/procps-000221.tar.gz
if you prefer a tarball. There are minor differences. The procps
used by Red Hat and many other non-Debian systems has many bugs.
According to the source I have:
/*****************************************************************/
/* on fork(), kernel does:    p->start_time = jiffies;  */
unsigned long   seconds_since_boot = -1;
static unsigned long seconds_since_1970;
static unsigned long time_of_boot;
/* fill in pp->start_time value directly from kernel's start_time */
void foo(void){                                           
  /* ... */
  &P->start_time, &P->vsize,
  &P->rss,
  &P->rss_rlim,
  /* ... */
}
                            
void some_init_functions(void){
  seconds_since_boot    = uptime(0,0);
  seconds_since_1970 = time(NULL);
  time_of_boot = seconds_since_1970 - seconds_since_boot;
  /* ... */
}
static int pr_lstart(void){
  time_t t;
  t = (
           ((unsigned long)time_of_boot)
         + ((unsigned long)pp->start_time)
         / Hertz
  );
  return sprintf(outbuf, "%24.24s", ctime(&t));
}
