   On my machine, de4x5.c works, while tulip.c doesn't.
   Machine is a CHRP/PPC box, Ethernet is 21041 based D-Link DE-530CT.
 ...
   So at least the Ethernet HW address is in the wrong endiannes for tulip.c.
   Are there people who can use tulip.c on a big endian machine?
Nope, I gave up a long time ago using anything other than de4x5.c on
sparc machines. 
Later,
