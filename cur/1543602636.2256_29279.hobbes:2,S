Seems to me you aren't necessarily OOM, that's why the killer don't
kick in.  You simply have a working set larger than RAM, and is
trashing into a hopeless slowness.  This slowness may even postpone
further allocations so you need more time to go OOM.  
If you _want_ to get OOM killed quickly - allocate way too much memory
but keep the working set small.
