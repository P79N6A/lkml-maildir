Hi,
This is a trivial patch to save a word-length worth of space. Just
something that seemed easy to do while I was reading over the source
code.
Diffed against 2.6.9:

=================================================
After looking over the MAINTAINERS file, I have no idea who the right
point of contact / maintainer is for this code. (Or, I simply missed the
right entry while reading, which has been known to happen.) Please advise.
