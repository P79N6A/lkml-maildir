Keith,
	Copping out with "not my job" and then demanding essentially a
mathematical proof of correctness is unpersuasive, but I have no
objection to your change (some select "define_bool xxx no" lines in
a common file that every architecture reads), as long as we have
established that it seems to get along with "make xconfig" after all.
If that is the case, then I'd be just as happy that Linus apply your patch.
	So, with that lame endorsement and nobody else still objecting
to your patch (right?), how about if you submit your patch to Linus,
or is there some other way you want to proceed?
