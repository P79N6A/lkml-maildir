Actually, Ingo's rmap style sounds very similar to what I first implemented 
in one of my stabs at rmap.  It has a nasty side effect of being worst case 
for cache organisation -- the sister page tends to map to the exact same 
cache line in some processors.  Whoops.  That said, I think that the rmap 
pte-chains can really stand a bit of optimization by means of discarding a 
couple of bits, as well as merging for adjacent pages, so I don't think 
the overhead is a lost cause yet.  And nobody has written the clone() patch 
for bash yet...
