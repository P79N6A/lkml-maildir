Sorry, I missed that change. I see your point now.

Right. The question is how many clients out there do still rely on the
current behaviour?
Looking at Brent's 'NFS Illustrated', I see that he notes that for
NLM_GRANTED, the cookie is "An opaque value that is normally the same as
the client sent in the LOCK request, though the client cannot depend on
it". Which sounds like weasel words for "some clients still do depend on
it".
