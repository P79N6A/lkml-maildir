	Okay...  The locking bug with IRIX/NFS/Linux has become critical.
I don't trust my coding enough to fix the problem, and I think it would
take me a long time to fix.  
	My company has budgeted $500 to this problem.  To someone familiar
with Linux NFS locking code, this fix should take less than three hours.
I can supply access to two different IRIX machines and a number of Linux
machines for testing.  
	Any takers?  Please?  I needed this 3 months ago, but I'm about to
build a large web server pool using Linux. Irix is, unfortunately the file
server since it's the biggest piece of hardware we own.  
	Help?
