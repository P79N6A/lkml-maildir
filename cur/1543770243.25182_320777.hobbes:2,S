The problem is that for subtractive decode bridges we assume
full "transparency" and completely ignore standard p2p bridge
resources (i.e. windows) just using first 3 parent bus pointers
whatever they are.
This model does work in most cases, but there are potential problems
with peer-to-peer DMA behind such bridges, poor performance for MMIO
ranges outside bridge windows, prefetchable vs. non-prefetchable issues
and so on.
If we had 6 or more resource pointers in struct pci_bus, then the
appended patch would fix that.

Actually no. Low-level bridge drivers (p2p, cardbus or particular
host bridge) certainly know about resource layout of the respective
device. But generic resource management code doesn't make any
assumptions about that and looks only at resource types.

No trouble at all, I guess.
