[correction: meant CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD, because CONFIG_MD itself does
not generate any code]
So just because almost everyone needs CONFIG_SCSI (SATA, usb_storage,
you name it), you're going to compile that in as well? It's just
another 180 KB [BLK_DEV_MD: ~100K] so let's compile it in!
There is a reason initramfs exists, and it's not only for firmware
loading or running custom scripts.
