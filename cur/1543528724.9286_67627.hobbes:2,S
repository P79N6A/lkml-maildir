Aaargh! 
Does that mean that I can't run:
	int   *input_data;
	float *temp_data1;
	float *temp_data2;
	float *outputdata;
	main ()
	{
		input_data = malloc (HUGEVAL *sizeof (int));;
		temp_data1 = malloc (HUGEVAL *sizeof (float));;
		temp_data2 = malloc (HUGEVAL *sizeof (float));;
		outputdata = malloc (HUGEVAL *sizeof (float));;
		
		read_dataset (input_data, argv[1]);
		process_step_1 (input_data, temp_data1);
		process_step_2 (temp_data1, temp_data2);
		process_step_3 (temp_data2, outputdata);
		write_dataset (output_data, argv[2]);
	}
with say 1.5G datasets and just 4G of RAM?
4 * 1.5G is 6G, so it doesn't all fit into RAM at the same time, while
every processing step uses only 2 * 1.5G = 3G of RAM, which fits
easily.
