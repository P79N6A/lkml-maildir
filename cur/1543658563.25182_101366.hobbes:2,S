You should certainly see it in "uname -a" output, for example.

And it's less disgusting than adding a kernel hack for it?
Trust me, kernel stuff is for stuff that _cannot_ be gotten in user space, 
not for random hacks.

So? 
The same is true of kernel modules - 32-bit kernel modules do not work at 
all when the kernel is 64-bit.
Compile oprofile for the proper architecture if you do it yourself, and
complain to the vendor if the vendor is stupid enough to supply a 32-bit 
oprofile with a 64-bit kernel.
There is _no_ excuse to bloat the kernel for user mistakes.
