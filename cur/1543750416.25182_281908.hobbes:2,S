Umm, the program has nothing to do with this.  Programs themselves have 
no
access to the kernel function "capable".  Probably something in the 
kernel, perhaps
triggered by libc or maybe just suid checks, is checking for 
CAP_SYS_ADMIN. It's
harmless and irrelevant, why do you care?

Yes, whenever anything on the computer, including the kernel, checks if 
a program
has a capability bit set, it will print out whether or not it does in 
the dmesg.  Why
does that matter?

Programs aren't, the kernel is, for whatever reason.
