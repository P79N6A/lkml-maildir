yes it is. but the number of bits is not. On a 32 bit system "long long" is
64 bits. On a 64bit system it is 128. And if you need more bits that
that you are out of luck. "long long" is imprecise, I'd prefer a construct
like "int var: 64". This way I know exactly how many bits are available.
If I need 128 bits for something (or even 4096) then I can define them. Or
is there going to be a "long long long long" for 128 bits, and "long long
long long long long .... long" to reach 4096?
