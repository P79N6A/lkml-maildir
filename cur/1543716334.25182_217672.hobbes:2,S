Fixing a kthread_stop() race is a quite different thing from fixing a
create-workqueue() error-path deadlock and hence should be a separate
patch.
And the description of that separate patch should explain the race which
it is fixing!  Yes, the logic in worker_thread() is a bit dorky, but I
don't believe that there is a race in there.
I dropped that part of your patch.  Please resend, with justification, if
you disagree.
Thanks.
