It could be.  I just found a bug in the USB core for 2.6.20-rc which might 
be responsible.
On the other hand, maybe it was just some random occurrence.  Noise on the
USB data line or something like that.  Considering your record of
untroubled uptime, this seems likely.  Of course, if it keeps happening
then we should look for a systematic cause.
