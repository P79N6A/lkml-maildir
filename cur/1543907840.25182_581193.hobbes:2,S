It seems to me that this patch will reduce the frequency of irqd/softirqd 
starvation, but the core problem still exists: softirq tasks can't migrate to 
other CPUs to perform their work if a higher priority task preempts them.  
I'm wondering if we want to keep special casing things to minimize the 
problem or not - seems to me the worst case is still the same - and isn't the 
worst case the only case that matters (for -rt)?
