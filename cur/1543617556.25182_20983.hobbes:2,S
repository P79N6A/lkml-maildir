As far as I know the current hisax drivers (which are included in the kernel as well) support d-channel. But the d channel is only meant for starting a connection, not to support whole traffic. And it is rather slow. So it would make no fun compared to 64kbs
They support real traffic. The Telekom (here in Germany) used it for a
free (in addition to the normal IDSN internet access ...) "continously
connected" service. For email and chat. It was only a test and never
spread widely ...
