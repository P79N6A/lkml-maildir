Hi,
I'm trying to get S3 suspend working on a new HP Nc6400 notebook PC, and
I'm having problems getting SATA restarted on resume. 
The SATA controller is an intel ICH7/AHCI, as shown in this lspci -v:
00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation 82801GBM (ICH7-M) LPC Interface
Bridge (rev 01)

The BIOS on this notebook is pretty basic, at least as far as user
configuration options goes. I tried the ata_piix driver, but the SATA
controller wasn't detected, and there's no way to change the bios mode.
I read about -mm6 and tried to give it a go, but I get this error:
ata1.00: exception Emask 0x10 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x4050000 action 0x2 frozen
ata1.00: tag 0 cmd 0x35 Emask 0x14 stat 0x40 err 0x0 (ATA bus error)
ata1: waiting for device to spin up (8 secs)
ata1: soft resetting port
ata1: softreset failed (1st FIS failed)
ata1: softreset failed, retrying in 5 secs
ata1: hard resetting port
ata1: port is slow to respond, please be patient
ata1: port failed to respond (30 secs)
ata1: COMRESET failed (device not ready)
ata1: hardreset failed, retrying in 5 secs
ata1: hard resetting port
ata1: port is slow to respond, please be patient
ata1: port failed to respond (30 secs)
ata1: COMRESET failed (device not ready)
ata1: reset failed, giving up
After a while, there are SCSI errors reported, naturally.
And this is the error with 2.6.17.7 vanilla.
ata1: handling error/timeout
ata1: port reset. p_is 400000 is 0 pis 400000 cmd 2004 tf 80 ss 113 se 4050000
ata1: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
sda: Current: sense key: No Sense
    Additional sense: No additional sense information
Info fld=0x8b8008e
Which repeats before ext3 gives an error.
So...what can I do to help get this up and running?
