What's the difference between this definition of 'offset' and alignment?
alignment means that (addr%alignment==0)
offset means that (addr1-addr2 == n*offset)
Isn't the only difference the alignment of the first object in a slab?

Some hardware drivers use HW_CACHEALIGN and assume certain byte
alignments, and arm needs 1024 byte aligned blocks.
