	Hi folks,
	Here's the patch on pcmcia-0.3.12 I worked out to compile it with
	linux-2.2.9 with Alan Cox's patch-2.2.9-ac6. This makes the PCMCIA
	Configure script aware of the new CONFIG_1GB and CONFIG_2GB config
	variables, and that makes the code in linux/asm/page_offset.h work
	correctly.
	Without this small patch, there are a lot of undefined PAGE_OFFSET_RAW
	references when compiling the pcmcia sources.
	Enjoy!
	Hi Kayvan,
Check the NEW directory at Hyper.stanford.edu/pub/pcmcia.
the 11-Jun version works.
