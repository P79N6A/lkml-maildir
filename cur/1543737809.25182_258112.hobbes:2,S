Hello,
(Please Cc: me on reply - I am not on the list)
I decided to give the voluntary preempt patch a try, but I ran into some
problems. I share them with you, hoping to contribute in some way to the
process.
I decided to build my kernel the Debian way (make-kpkg), with the config
file from the 2.6.8 package as a starting point. In order to get it to
build, I had to disable:
CONFIG_SCSI_ADVANSYS
CONFIG_DVB_BT8XX
CONFIG_DRM_GAMMA
and set
CONFIG_4KSTACKS=y
When booting the new kernel, problems occur with the ethernet device
(e100), and, not surprisingly, networking fails. Any idea? The IRQ 177
looks rather strange to me...
