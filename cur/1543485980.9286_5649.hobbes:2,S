It looks like it is simply being too aggressive about starting the
wakeup_bdflush(1) behaviour.  This is the problem with such a patch: if
we make write buffering less aggressive then it is far too easy to lose
write throughput on larger machines.
Anyway, I have a couple of people currently testing or waiting to test
the patch below against 2.2.2-pre4.  The wakeup_bdflush(1) test is now
conditional _only_ on the number of locked buffers, independently of
the number of dirty buffers.  The more people who can try this before
2.2.2-pre4, the better.
More importantly, it adds the check in bdflush to refile locked
buffers on the clean list after IO.  Linus, you missed this bit of the
patch from 2.2.2-pre4, and it is the most important part of it:
without that, it is impossible to know how many of the BUF_LOCKED
buffers are _really_ locked, and therefore how to throttle the writes
while keeping the IO queues full.  There's no point releasing
2.2.2-pre4 without that bit of the patch: it will simply stop doing
anything useful (as Simon found) because the refile_buffer logic will
see there being far too many BUF_LOCKED buffers, even after the IO has
completed.
