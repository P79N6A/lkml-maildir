because I asked the only competent instanace around: my computer.
  : ferkel:~ # more sc.c
  : #include        <stdio.h>
  : 
  : int main() {
  : signed char ca;
  : unsigned char cb;
  : 
  : signed int ia;
  : unsigned int ib;
  : 
  :         ca=-1;
  :         cb=2;
  :         if (ca<cb) printf("ca<cb\n");
  :         else if (ca>cb) printf("ca>cb\n");
  :         else printf("ca==cb\n");
  : 
  :         ia=-1;
  :         ib=2;
  :         if (ia<ib) printf("ia<ib\n");
  :         else if (ia>ib) printf("ia>ib\n");
  :         else printf("ia==ib\n");
  : 
  : }
this will give the result:
  : ferkel:~ # ./sc
  : ca<cb
  : ia>ib
you see? 
if you _explictely_ cast the signed value to unsigned, the result will
be wrong just the same way as if you did not cast it at all. if you
cast the unsigned value to signed, you will have the same problem if
the unsigned value is >  0x7fffffff. so the new macros are absolutely
unneccessary, because they do not fix anything.

no, that was just an example. long long doesnt work either.  and the
sizeof(int) is bound to 32bit platforms. unfortunately, I dont have a
64bit CPU around. the problem seems to arise where the size of a datatype
equals or extends the size of a machineword. so, really correct would
be:
  : if sizeof(typeof(a))>=sizeof(machineword) &&
  :    sizeof(typeof(b))>=sizeof(machineword)
   
however I dont know where to get this "machineword".
