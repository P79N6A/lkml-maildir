No of course it doesn't.  First they try it.  The lucky few find it is
adequate and they are happy.  The rest find that their new $100,000
cluster really sucks with DSM and have to spend the next 6 months
recoding the application to use message passing.
They are forced to think, because they just spent $100,000 and it had
better have been worth the money :-)

You have a 10MLOC program and you don't have 6 months or the 20
talented programmers who know how to break it up into messages.  And
your mate at the institution down the road already has a 200 node
cluster which is idle on Thursday.
Choice 1: hire people (6+ months), understand and change code (6+ months)
Choice 2: turn on DSM and run it on cluster down the road (1-7 days
depend on current weekday)

Message passing is generally very fast.  Unfortunately it's not, with
current designs, autmatic.  Unless you count DSM :-)

What if even a 10ms second lock is perfectly fine?  Each computational
iteration between locks might take several seconds or minutes, depending
on your problem.
