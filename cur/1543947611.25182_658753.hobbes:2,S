I don't understand the distinction and I don't see what sysprof (as defined
by its kernel->userspace interface) can do which oprofile cannot.

all the bugs, inefficiencies and deficiencies addressed and which has a
vaguely respectable description.

afacit all of these criticisms surround oprofile's userspace tools only.
