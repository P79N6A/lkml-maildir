My machine has a single ISA card which is a SB 64 AWE GOLD. The HDDs are running of
the motherboard controller. I have two hdds on one controller, two cd-roms (1
reader, 1 rewriter) on the other. This test was performed when ripping the Britney
Spears Sometimes single to create a wav file. cdrecord produces some interuption, I
used cdparanoia becausethat seems to be much worse so that you can seethe effects.
This also occurs when I write cd-roms, but I don't want to waste a couple of cds
unless you think it's useful in which case I will.

As far as I am aware they are in Bus master mode. The machine was built by myself
and is less than 1 year old (PII 400 Mhz 128Mb RAM, 256 MbSWAP (128Mb on each of
the two hdds). I did not adjust this setting so I assume that it is using Bus
mastering mode which is normal on all modern machines.

I already had sound playing, started the command, waited 5 secs, started ripping,
continued until ripping finished, waited a couple of secs (I think 5) and then
stopped vmstat. During the ripping there was a horrible "slow motiony slow down" of
the music, like when you hold a tape and physically slow it down as it moves inside
a tape player. Also, it often "cut's out" for several seconds at a time as it did
once or twice here.

I assume you are refering to the sbs which have a hdd controller onboard? Mine are
on the motherboard separate from the sb64.
If you want any further info, just tell me what you need and you've got it
