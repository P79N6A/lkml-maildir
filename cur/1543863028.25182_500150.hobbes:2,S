Whoops, I should never have said "never".  Checking further back,
I found that in 2.4, and prior to 2.6.12, mmap_kmem was simply
#defined to mmap_mem, and so you would then have had to subtract
PAGE_OFFSET (well, on i386 at least) from the kernel virtual
address to get it to work.
Andi fixed that in 2.6.12.  I agree with his fix: the same data should
appear at the same offset whether you use mmap or read, which was not
so before his patch (nor after Franck's).  Though I do wonder whether
it was safe to change its behaviour at that stage: more evidence that
few have actually been using mmap of /dev/kmem.

That's exactly the way I've used mmap of /dev/kmem in the past myself:
yes, a convenient way to collect stats or patch flags when investigating
something on a private kernel.  There are probably more sophisticated
alternatives now (systemtap, [a-z]probes), but mmap of /dev/kmem is
pretty easy to understand, whatever its limitations.
You're right to question whether you'll be safer in the long term to
use /dev/mem instead, doing the virtual to physical conversion yourself:
I share your doubt.  On the one hand, /dev/kmem is clearly underused,
with an interface which changes without anyone noticing; and Fedora
doesn't even supply the node (they'd like to get rid of /dev/mem also,
I believe - too wide an open door into the kernel - but a few tools
still use it).  On the other hand, if for some reason we make the 
mapping between physical and kernel virtual more complicated in
future, /dev/kmem should in theory save you from having to worry
about that (though in practice none of us has ever got around to
supporting mmap of the vmalloc area through /dev/kmem yet).
I think, if this thread provokes a call to remove support for mmap
of /dev/kmem, I'd find that hard to argue against, and you'd better
switch to /dev/mem.  But personally I'd prefer it to remain.
