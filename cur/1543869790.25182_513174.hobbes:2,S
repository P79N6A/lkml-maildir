I see our main discussion trouble I think.
I never ever tried to say, that every bit in read() should be
non-blocking, it would be even more stupid than you expect it to be.
But you and Ingo do not want to see, what I'm trying to say, because it
is too cozy to read own right ideas than others.
I want to say, that read() consists of tons of events, but programmer
needs only one - data is ready in requested buffer. Programmer might
not even know what is the object behind provided file descriptor.
One only wans data in the buffer.
That is an event.
It is also possible to have other events inside complex read() machinery
- for example waiting for page obtained via ->readpages().

Thread is simple just because there is an interface.
Change interface, and no one will ever want to do it.
Provide nice aio_read() (forget about posix) and everyone will use it.
I always said that combining of such models is a must, I fully agree,
but it seems that we still do not agree where the bound should be drawn.

In threading you still need to do exactly the same, since stat() can
not be done before open(). So you will maintain some state (actually
order of things which will not be changed).
Have the same in the function.
Then start execution - it can be perfectly done using threads.
Just because it is unconvenient to program using state machines and
there is no appropriate interface.
But there are another operations.
Consider database or whatever you like, which wants to read thousands of
blocks from disk, each access potentially blocks, and blocking on the
mutex is nothing compared to blocking on waiting for storage to be ready
to provide data (network, disk, whatever). If storage is not optimized
(or small cache, or something else) we end up with blocked contexts,
which sleep - thousands of contexts.
And this number will not decrease.
So we ended with enourmous overhead just because we do not have simple
enough aio_read() and aio_wait().

You have said that finally!
"can practically speaking be implemented".
I see your and Ingo point - kevent is a 'merde' (pardon my french, but I
even somehow glad Ingo said (almost) that - I now have plenty of time for other
interesting projects), we want threads. 
Ok, you have threads, but you need to wait on (some of) them.
So you will invent the wheel again - some subsystem which will wait for
threads (likely waiting on futexes), then other events (probably).
Eventually it will be the same from different point of view :)
Anyway, I _do_ hope we understood each other that both events and
threads can co-exist, although board was not drawn.
My point is that many things can be done using event just because they
are faster and smaller - and IO (any IO without limit) is one of the
areas where it is unbeatable.
Threading in turn can be done a higher-layer abstraction model - thread
can wrap around the whole transaction with all related data flows, but
not thread per IO.
