Well certainly something appears to go wrong.  So far I have used a dvd
writer (PX708A and PX716A) on kernels up to 2.6.10 (i386) and 2.6.11
(amd64) and had no problems using ide-cd to do the burning (writing
DVDs using growisofs of course, and CDs using cdrecord).

Well it does look odd that it loads with one and not the other.  Which
kernel is this with?
Does writing CDs and DVDs actually work using ide-scsi?  Does it work
using ide-cd?
