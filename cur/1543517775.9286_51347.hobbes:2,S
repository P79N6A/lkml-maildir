Unless the sysadm has process accounting enabled he has no way to guess
who did the link and kiked me out of quota. If he has process accounting
enabled you must hope to have not run `ln` too at the directory mtime.
If instead I am out of quota because a malicious task is taking a file
opened, then the admin will find the malicious user immediatly.
Also taking opened a file can't screwup the filesystem namespace.
