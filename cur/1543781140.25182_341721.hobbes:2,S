I'm not sure if I understand the issue, but swsusp works on a different level.
It only needs to figure out which physical pages, as represented by struct page
objects, should be saved to swap before suspend.  We browse all zones (once)
and create a list of page frames that should be saved on the basis of the contents
of the struct page objects alone.  IMHO if we needed to use any additional
mechanisms here, it would be less efficient than just checking the page flags.

I should have said "not enough".  The problem is that there may be some page
frames corresponding to RAM (eg such that page_is_ram(pfn) is non-zero) which
for some reason should not be saved on given architecture and we need a
mechanism allowing us to identify them.
