I reverted Neil's avoid_lockdep_warning_in_md.patch and everything works fine.
2.6.19-rc1-mm1 + avoid_lockdep_warning_in_md.patch works well for me.
2.6.19-rc1-mm1 + convert-cpu-hotplug-notifiers-to-use-raw_notifier-instead-of-blocking_notifier.patch also works well.
2.6.19-rc1-mm1 + both patches = crashing hibernation.

Avoid lockdep warning in md.
md_open takes ->reconfig_mutex which causes lockdep to complain.
This (normally) doesn't have deadlock potential as the possible
conflict is with a reconfig_mutex in a different device.
I say "normally" because if a loop were created in the array->member
hierarchy a deadlock could happen.  However that causes bigger
problems than a deadlock and should be fixed independently.
So we flag the lock in md_open as a nested lock.  This requires
defining mutex_lock_interruptible_nested.
