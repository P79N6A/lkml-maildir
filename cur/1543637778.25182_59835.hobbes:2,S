Hello, world!\n

Exactly.  I've marked it as obsolete years ago, but when I wanted
to rip it out, Linus said he likes /proc/pci and it has to stay.
I still think that it's an extremely ugly interface, especially
because it requires the kernel to contain the list of vendor and device
names.
				Have a nice fortnight
