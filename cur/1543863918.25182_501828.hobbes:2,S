Besides the test_and_clear_bit, I think the bqt code(refer to last mail)
also needs protection, like:
	list_del_init(&rq->queuelist);
	...
	if (unlikely(bqt->tag_index[tag] == NULL))
		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: tag %d is missing\n",
		       __FUNCTION__, tag);
	bqt->tag_index[tag] = NULL;
	bqt->busy--;
and
	bqt->tag_index[tag] = rq;
	...
	list_add(&rq->queuelist, &bqt->busy_list);
	bqt->busy++;
because bqt is also globally shared within all devices in the host in
this case. (q->queue_tags was assigned as host->bqt in scsi_activate_tcq
)
With a gcc 4.1.0 compiled kernel, I did not get kernel panic, but
still got kernel errors: "tag  is missing". I guess a possible race
scenario could be:
cpu a:__test_and_clear_bit
cpu b:test_and_set_bit, allocate a tag just freed by cpu a
cpu b:bqt->tag_index[tag] = rq; 
cpu a:bqt->tag_index[tag] = NULL;
Next time, when the request returns,  
	if (unlikely(bqt->tag_index[tag] == NULL))
		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: tag %d is missing\n",
		       __FUNCTION__, tag);
prints out "tag  is missing".
There may possibly be some other errors. So we need a lock here.
I think the simple but reliable way to do it is just to replace
queue lock with a host lock. James pointed out that there may be
performance slow down when many devices are accessed at the
same time. But I think the major part is still on the hardware,
and a host lock is the price these kind of controllers must pay.
To your question:
but you could see the "attempt to clear non-busy tag" error though
Yes I did see it. And then I see the BUG() at blk_queue_start_tag()
	if (unlikely((rq->cmd_flags & REQ_QUEUED))) {
		printk(KERN_ERR 
		       "%s: request %p for device [%s] already tagged
%d",
		       __FUNCTION__, rq,
		       rq->rq_disk ? rq->rq_disk->disk_name : "?",
rq->tag);
		BUG();
	}
Because after "attempt to clear non-busy tag" error REQ_QUEUED flag
is not cleared.
