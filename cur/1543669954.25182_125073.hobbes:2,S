How do you deal with ensuring (or even trying to ensure) that the stuff *on 
disk* is sane?
If I understand correctly, msync() doesn't guarantee order of writes, so 
randomly firing off msync() calls doesn't help.
If I want to update an entry and then set a flag saying that the entry is 
correct, I need to have two msyncs, one for the entry data, and one for the 
flag.  I had hoped that I could avoid this by opening the file with O_SYNC, but 
hpa just disabused me of that notion...
Are the mmap semantics different for devices?
