The thing is that kobject_uevent calls call_usermodehelper with
wait=0. That means that it conly waits for execve("/sbin/hotplug")
call to complete, it does not wait for the entire process ti complete.
If you look at Andy's second trace you will see that we are waiting
for the disk I/O to get /sbin/hotplug from the disk. Pavel, do you
know why IO does not complete? khelper is a kernel thread so it is
marked with
PF_NOFREEZE. Could it be that we managed to freeze kblockd?
