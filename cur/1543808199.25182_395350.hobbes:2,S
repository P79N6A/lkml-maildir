Yes.  The code is now split into the part that handles the snapshot image
(in snapshot.c) and the part that writes/reads it to swap (in swap.c). [I'm
referring to recent -mm kernels.]
The access to the snapshot image is provided via the functions
snapshot_write_next() and snapshot_read_next() that are called by the
code in swap.c and may be used by the user space tools via the
interface in user.c.  In principle it ought to be possible to plug
something else instead of the code in snapshot.c without
breaking the rest.
Greetings,
Rafael
