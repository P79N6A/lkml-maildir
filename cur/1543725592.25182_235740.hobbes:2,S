4kb stacks were added after 2.6.0 and now 4KSTACKS=y results in Oops'es 
under some circumstances if using XFS.
2.6 currently still becomes stabler, but every new/changed feature bears 
the risk of breaking something.

Who will maintain the many subtrees of 2.6 this implies?
Even after 2.6.20 was already released, you might have to release a 
2.6.19.5 with a few additional security fixes since according to your 
advice users should continue to use 2.6.19 for a few weeks which 
implies that someone will have to maintain at least the 2.6.19 tree for 
at least a few weeks after the release of 2.6.20 .
