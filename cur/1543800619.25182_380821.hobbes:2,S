yeah, agreed. I did this in my tree. (the other sem2completion patches 
are not affected)

i included them because they reduce the number of semaphores that are 
used in a non-mutex fashion, and thus make the mutex conversion easier. 
I.e. i consider both the sem2mutex and the sem2completion patches as 
part of the 'convert semaphores to mutexes' effort, even though 
sem2completions are independent technically. They can be applied 
independently of the mutex subsystem itself, of course.
