Sometimes there are new devices that need device specific
handling (e.g. max number of commands, no. of SG elements, etc
are bigger or smaller) and an old driver on a new board
might do bad things.  Currently, you can run an old driver
on a new board by explictly telling it to make the attempt
via a command line option, iirc, but having it do it always 
and without user prodding it to do so is less safe.

If you are OK with the patch other than the product table, how about
if you apply the patch as-is, and I post a follow-on patch to fix the
indentation?
I'm contemplating more than just a white-space change, and it'd
probably be better to keep the "indent" patch to be white-space
changes only.
The cciss_pci_device_id[] table lists a bunch of subvendor and
subdevice IDs.  Is there any reason to check those sub-IDs
explicitly?  In other words, we currently list:
        {PCI_VENDOR_ID_COMPAQ, PCI_DEVICE_ID_COMPAQ_CISS,
         0x0E11, 0x4070, 0, 0, 0},
Could we replace that with:
        {PCI_VENDOR_ID_COMPAQ, PCI_DEVICE_ID_COMPAQ_CISS,
         PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0},
This would potentially make the driver claim additional devices.
But do COMPAQ/CISS devices with sub-IDs other than the listed ones
really exist anyway?
