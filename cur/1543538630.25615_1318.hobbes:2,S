It can't --- not directly, at least --- but the underlying
kiobuf-based IO code can improve CPU efficiency for swap IO.

Sure, but disk seeks are so much more expensive than anything else
that you really want to minimise them at all costs.  In 2.2 we added
paging clustering, which performs extra IO to minimise seeks, at the
cost of potentially evicting too many useful pages from memory to make
room for clustered incoming pages which aren't guaranteed to be used.
It made things _enormously_ faster for paging.

Ultimately we really need to be allocating pages based on VM address,
not on lru location, to get remotely good swap clustering.  The
existinng VM-based scanout achieves this cheaply as a side effect of
the scan order, but we need to realise that it isn't perfect and that
every move to a physical page-based scan algorithm will require us to
think about replacing the clustering mechanism.
Cheers,
 Stephen
