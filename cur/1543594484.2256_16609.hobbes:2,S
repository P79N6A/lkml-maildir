Well, since we are still beating this one to death, I'd written a "knew" 
macro as well, and put it aside.  It does the assignment for you too:
   #define knew(p) ((p) = (typeof(p)) kmalloc(sizeof(*(p)), GFP_KERNEL))
Example:
 	struct foo { int a; int b; };
	struct { struct foo *foo; } *foobar;
	if (knew(foobar))
		if (knew(foobar->foo))
			printk("foo: %p\n", foobar->foo);
Terse and clear at the same time, and type safe.  I still don't like it much.
