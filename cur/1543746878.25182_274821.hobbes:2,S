No we aren't.  We're just trying to make the kernel interface more
explicit.  Nothing should change as far as userspace programs are
concerned.  It might need some coordination with the various libcs.
And enough with the doom-and-gloom big-companies-are-scared approach, OK?
It's (a) untrue, (b) irrelevant, and (c) many of us work for big companies
that are doing Linux already.  We don't need to be lectured by you.
