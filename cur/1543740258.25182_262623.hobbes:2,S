Non-compete agreements are VERY tricky, and in some cases are only valid 
until/unless the information is made available to the public. Let a 
lawyer explain the details, but available to the public seems to mean 
that if A steals the info and publishes it, B is no longer bound, or 
something like that. Again, let a lawyer clarify, I know there is an 
issue but I don't claim to understand the ramifications.

Since they are SCO's claims, why should he? Or do you wish to attach his 
opinion that SCO seems confident?

You don't like what he says so you try to shut him up? That argument 
doesn't go far in court.
