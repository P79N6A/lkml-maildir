Even if we don't have the drivers yet, the sooner it's available and
in use the better, then we can always drop in hardware support later.
(Still, I'm not volunteering for either job so I won't complain, just

Owch. But I assume this didn't sneak in since the testing cryptoAPI
patches? Or have the algorithms been redone?

But why was it ever changed to on big file in the first place?
