Not if you want to get any useful work done. No Unix does this. The
situation with multiple parallel lseek/read/writes is somewhat undefined
anyway since you don't know if the seek or the write occurred first in
user space.
O_APPEND is a bit different, as are pread/pwrite but those are dealt
with using locking for files.
