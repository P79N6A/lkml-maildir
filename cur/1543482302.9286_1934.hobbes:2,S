Something like
Chop memory into 4Mb sized chunks that hold the perfectly normal and existing
pages and buddy memory allocator. Set a flag on 25-33% of them to a max of say 
10 and for <12Mb boxes simply say "tough". 
The performance impact of that on free page requests seems to be pretty minimal.
In actual fact it wil help performance in some cases since the machine can't 
easily be killed by going out of non kernel space allocations - the 25% is
also a "can do work" sanity check.
