An update.
I just had a reoccurrence of this bug, without using NFS root.  This is
under Debian's packaged 2.6.17-2, and the same issue occurred with
2.6.18-2.  Total and complete system lockup.  Serial console is fruitless.
I have been forced to downgrade to 2.6.9.  Does anyone out there, have any
ideas for debugging this complete lockup in 2.6.17/2.6.18?  It seems to be
NFS activity related, but I can not verify this at this point in time.
