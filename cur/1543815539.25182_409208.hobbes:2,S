We're usually pretty picky about adding stuff to 'struct page'.  It
_just_ fits inside a cacheline on most 32-bit architectures.  
Can this wired_count not be derived at runtime?  It seems like it would
be possible to run through all VMAs mapping the page, and determining
how many of them are VM_LOCKED.  Would that be too slow?
Also, does it matter how many times it is locked, or just that
_somebody_ has it locked?
