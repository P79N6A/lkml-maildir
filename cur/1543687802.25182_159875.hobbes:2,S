Just around nobody in the list is able to judge if _having_ a bk2cvs gateway
(software) is a commercial win for your product or not. Therefore nobody can
argue with you about the statement. This is fine for you, but bad for
listeners. Effectively they leave the place with a feeling of being only
grumblers and spongers.
And since quite a lot of people are doing positive things regarding linux that
are never ever rewarded - not even by a one-liner in some credits-file - you
have to accept that they don't want and need that feeling and therefore simply
dislike you - completely unrelated to your former, current or future _work_.
