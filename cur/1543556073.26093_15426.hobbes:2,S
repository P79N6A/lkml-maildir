There shouldn't be any problems if you have the disk and CDrw drive on
different IDE busses, though, as I do. Also, provided the CDrw drive is
releasing the bus at times (which it should, presumably, since it can't be fast
enough to max out the bus all the time), you can then burst the data in from
the HDD, even on a shared bus. Even the fastest CDrw drive shouldn't get
underruns, I think.
Having said that, I'd still want to have both drives on different busses;
ideally, a SCSI CDrw and DVD drive, and ATA/100 HDDs. Now I just need to get
the numbers right on the lottery :-)

Indeed - a lockup is never the right result!
