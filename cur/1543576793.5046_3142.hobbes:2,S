Ok, that's what I eventually figured by looking at the code as well.

Wait a minute, this is a new board. I had a suspicion, and I have a new
suspect, can we investigate this?
I have used the same kernel, with the VIA 686a patch, but left some
config options out:
# diff -U1 -Nur <(egrep -v '^(#|$)' linux-2.2.18-ma3/.config) <(egrep -v
'^(#|$)' linux-2.2.18-try/.config)

I rebooted, and since I left APM out, the system clock is alright since
63 mins. Might the APM BIOS CPU IDLE calls be related? I did *not* enable
CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS. I'll investigate this right now and report back
what I find.

Where is the source for the adjtimex /program/? SuSE don't bring
adjtimex.
