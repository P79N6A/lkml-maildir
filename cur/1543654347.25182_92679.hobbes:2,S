	I expect struct io_restrictions to be useful beyond blkdev.  I
want to evolve it for use in DMA scatterlists in general, so blkdev.h
could only be a temporary home.  If you really want and nobody else
objects, I'd be willing to create a separate .h file for struct
io_restrictions.  (I assume that what you find "improper" about
device-mapper.h is that block devices themselves do not depend
on any abstractions specific to the device mapper.)
	That would not break device-mapper, and you could take the
less disruptive approach of submitting a patch to glibc and/or
device-mapper to eliminate the user level program including kernel
headers.
