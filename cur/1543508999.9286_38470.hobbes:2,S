I maintain a non-official version of ftape-4.03-pre2 (the latest
official pre-release) updated to work with the latest 2.2.x/2.3.x
kernels. You can get it at 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/ftape/.
I don't know how well it will work with the Ditto Max, but it
does work fine with my Seagate TapeStore 3200.
