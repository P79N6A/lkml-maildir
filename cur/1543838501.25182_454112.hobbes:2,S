What architecture is this? On a 32-bit architecture with a 2MB stack 
size (which I think is the default) you couldn't possibly create more 
than 2048 threads just because of stack space requirements. Reducing the 
stack size would get you more.
I should also point out that any design that requires 40,000 threads is 
probably quite flawed unless you are running on a very large machine..
