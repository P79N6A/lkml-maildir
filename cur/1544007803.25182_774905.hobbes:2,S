Again, it's just awful to make a change which has already be tried and
rejected.  Especially as we don't really fully understand why it was
rejected (do we?).  The information we seek may well be in the mailing

Fingers crossed, it might be that the `priority < DEF_PRIORITY' here
will save our bacon from <whatever it was>.  But it sure would be good
to know.
