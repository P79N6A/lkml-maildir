Could you be a little more clear here?  If you are saying that the other
callbacks will need to do work?  I can assure you we will clean up those
pages and raise memory protections.  It will also be done in a much more
efficient fashion than the individual callouts.
If, on the other hand, you are saying we can not because of the way
we traverse the list, can we return a result indicating to the caller
we would like to be unregistered and then the mmu_notifier code do the
remove followed by a call to the release notifier?

But if the notifier is removed from the list following the invalidate_all
callout, there would be no additional callouts.
Thanks,
