I was mainly adding a field to the superblock for the sake of
reiserfs; it was the easiest way to support it's current insanity of
reporting 128megs as st_blksize, but with a mount option that affected
things on a global scale.  (Hey, at least my patch made resierfs
support the mount option as a per-superblock setting, instead of
setting a global variable that changed the behaviour for all mounts.)
I don't mind espceially removing the superblock field, but if we do, I
refuse to mess with adding a getattr special for reiserfs; someone who
wants to support its current behaviour is free to send me or LKML
patches....
