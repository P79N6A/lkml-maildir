In Fedora 7 I see this:
# cdparanoia --version
cdparanoia III release 9.8 (March 23, 2001)
(C) 2001 Monty <monty@xiph.org> and Xiphophorus
Report bugs to paranoia@xiph.org
http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/
So, given that date, lk 2.4.2 was out but it was probably
a bit early to start using the sg version 3 interface
which first appeared in lk 2.4.1 . So that "lets annoy
the user" message was added by someone who got burnt by
the old sg version 2 interface and decided people needed
to be warned. The warning comes from this code is sg.c :
        /*
         * SG_DXFER_TO_FROM_DEV is functionally equivalent to SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV,
         * but is is possible that the app intended SG_DXFER_TO_DEV, because the
re
         * is a non-zero input_size, so emit a warning.
         */
        if (hp->dxfer_direction == SG_DXFER_TO_FROM_DEV)
                if (printk_ratelimit())
                        printk(KERN_WARNING
                               "sg_write: data in/out %d/%d bytes for SCSI comma
nd 0x%x--"
                               "guessing data in;\n" KERN_WARNING "   "
                               "program %s not setting count and/or reply_len pr
operly\n",
                               old_hdr.reply_len - (int)SZ_SG_HEADER,
                               input_size, (unsigned int) cmnd[0],
                               current->comm);
That code wasn't written be me and I would gladly remove it.
For anyone who has read the sg driver documentation,
SG_DXFER_TO_FROM_DEV implies a _read_ from the device. The
reason SG_DXFER_TO_FROM_DEV exists is for backward
compatibility to the sg version 1 interface. It was a hack to
get around the fact that the SCSI subsystem didn't report short
reads (what folks should use 'resid' for) back in those days.
It is probably about time that cdparanoia was updated ...
