Ok, I didn't realize that memfs was not a ramdisk.  Aside from
that, I think my arguments about ramdisks sucking nowadays are
valid.  Nonetheless I see people in both Linux and win95 wasting
valuable memory on their systems by putting various things into
ramdisk and I get a chuckle because if all those programs really
were used that often, they would be in cache memory anyways, and
not permanently.  ;o)
Take care,
