Don't be silly.  This only affects you if you untar as a different user
than you build as.  And if you do that, you will have a read-only
source directory which you can't build in anyway.[1]
[1] Though I am currently trying to change this.  I have a relatively
    small patch that changes some Makefiles, Configure, Menuconfig, etc.
    and adds an autoconf-ish `configure' to set up VPATHs.  Shows
    promise of working on i386 soon....
