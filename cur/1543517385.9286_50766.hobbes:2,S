before claiming that this is a BIOS issue do the following:
test this on a kernel with the low-latency patch applied with tuned EIDE
disks,
AND running the mp3 player at higher priority (SCHED_FIFO recommended)
than the cat command.
Ian, I own a similar hardware ( dual Celeron with Riva TNT2) ,
let mk know how to reproduce the timeouts,
(which mp3 player are you using what sequence of commands are you
running etc.)
so I will analyze the problem.
PS: Alan , I think most mp3 players use a relatively big buffersize
(most of time the full 64k of soundcard), and I don't think that VESA
disables
the IRQs for 370ms ( the time it takes to play the 64k audio buffer)
