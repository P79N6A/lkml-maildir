A PCMCIA card has to allocate its resources from within the PCMCIA region.
So it makes tons of sense to just say so. So a PCMCIA driver would do
	request_resource(&pcmcia_io_resource, &my_io_resource);
while a "direct" PCI driver would use
	request_resource(&pci_io_resource, &my_io_resource);
and I definitely don't at all understand why you'd want to have two tables
that show the same thing..
