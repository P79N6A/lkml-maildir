I was just looking at these things I found few more such files in
/etc.  Like /etc/adjtime, /etc/mrtg/<something> and /etc/.aumixrc.
I consider all of these user-space bugs.  There are also /etc/passwd
and /etc/shadow which will be written to if you are changing
passwords while not using something like NIS.  This is, in a sense,
a harder case but one can live with that.
