Hi,
I have two questions.There are one p2p bridge and 2 card bus bridges
under the p2p bridge. Firmware assign 8 for p2p bridge's subordinate bus
number. Since the bridge has default bridge number, PCI will not assign
again. But PCI does assign bus number 3~6 and 7~10 to the cardbus
bridge. And it's oversized. I must add pci=assign-busses. I guess many
systems with cardbus bridge have the problem. My question is if
pci=assign-busses should be the default behave.
And another question. Some bridges allocate many bus numbers, but they
don't use them right
now. A case is cardbus bridge. So should pci_bus_max_busnr return max
allocated bus number?
pci_bus_max_busnr(struct pci_bus* bus)
{
	struct list_head *tmp;
	unsigned char max, n;
-	max = bus->number;
+	max = bus->subordinate;
	list_for_each(tmp, &bus->children) {
		n = pci_bus_max_busnr(pci_bus_b(tmp));
		if(n > max)
			max = n;
	}
	return max;
}
thanks,
David
