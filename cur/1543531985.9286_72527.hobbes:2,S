If you don't use the "soft" real-time process support, the latency will
vary a lot, mostly depending on your workload.  If you have a light
workload, the latency would be close to the case when you use "soft"
real-time process (on average in 40 ms range), although the worst-case
latency can still be very bad (such as in 200 ms range).
Why don't you use real-time process?
I did a test to test preemptoin latency for a real-time process.  See
the preliminary results below. On average, you should expect your
(t1-t0) smaller than those numbers since they are the worst-case
numbers.
The CPU speed probably does not have much to do with the worst-case
latency, I suspect.
