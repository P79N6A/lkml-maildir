MSI is an optional feature so things are supposed to work even without MSI - are
you getting that great a benefit from MSI?

All mellanox PCI-X devices have a bridge inside them, so ...

It fails to generate interrupts.

I think it is.

Doesn't seem to work for me:
ib_mthca: Initializing 0000:04:00.0
GSI 18 sharing vector 0xB9 and IRQ 18
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:04:00.0[A] -> GSI 29 (level, low) -> IRQ 185
ib_mthca 0000:04:00.0: NOP command failed to generate interrupt (IRQ 217),
aborting.
ib_mthca 0000:04:00.0: Try again with MSI/MSI-X disabled.
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:04:00.0 disabled
ib_mthca: probe of 0000:04:00.0 failed with error -16
