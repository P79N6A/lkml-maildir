Wrong. It takes its own TLB entry (because the module code is in
vmalloced) space, which makes the precious TLB entry unavailable for
user programs. On most architectures the kernel is in one big page,
which means that all kernel code only uses one TLB. Also modules can
be only allocated with PAGE_SIZE (4K/8K) granuality, which means that
for small code a module is silly from the efficiency standpoint
(probably not from the debugging standpoint).
