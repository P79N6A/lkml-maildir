Please read line 1148 of /usr/src/linux-`uname -r`/net/ipv4/icmp.c.
The error message is in response to a bogus frame. The NETMASK
must match at both ends (a configuration error). If the mask matches,
then you can turn off the messages with 'sysctl', i.e., ....
`echo "1" >/proc/sys/net/icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses`.
Otherwise, find the interface netmask that's broken and fix it.
Cheers,
