There is one more nasty issue to deal with. 
You only want to take into account the buffer flushtime if
"check_flushtime" parameter is passed as true to flush_dirty_buffers
(which is done by kupdate).
Thinking a bit more about the issue, I dont see any reason why we want to
write all buffers of an anonymous page at
sync_buffers/flush_dirty_buffers.
I think we could simply write the buffer with ll_rw_block() if the page
which this buffer is sitting on does not have mapping->a_ops->writepage
operation defined.
