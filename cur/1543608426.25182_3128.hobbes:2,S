Seriously? 500*8 Mbit/sec = 4 Gbit/sec
In that case you need at least 10 boxes, each with a gigabit card,
with loadbalancing through DNS. Each box will do max. 400 mbit/sec
and have 50 clients on it - standard apache will do fine, I think.
Otherwise just add a few boxes.
You will need a Juniper M20 or a Cisco 124xx series with 2xSTM16 (OC64)
or 1x10GigE upload capacity and 10xGigE slots in it. That will cost
as much 100-200 of the Linux boxes so the Linux boxes are the least
of your worries. Not to mention the cost of 4 Gbit/sec of Internet
bandwidth.
Mike.
