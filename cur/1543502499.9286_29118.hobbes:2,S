I am still having a problem with downing IP alias devices (ethX:Y), where
downing the alias (which should remove it) instead downs the whole
interface, but does not remove the created alias device. I've been
searching in net/ipv4/devinet.c, and trying some changes to see if I could
determine why it does not remove the created alias. Does anyone have any
idea why this is? According to the aliasing docs, downing an alias device
should delete just the alias device, and leave the parent device up.
Thanks for any feedback anyone can give me.
This is with kernel 2.2.10.
