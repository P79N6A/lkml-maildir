Subject: invalid character 45 in exportstr for include-config

Anyone else seeing this error message?  I figured out what it _actually_
means is that the character `-' is not permitted in the symbol being
exported.  so if we change include-config to include_config in Makefile
and scripts/Makefile.build, everything is fine.
How about the following patch?
diff -u -p -r1.1.2.6 Makefile
