Well, think about it - if there are DMA/IRQ timeouts, the hardware IS rooted.
Otherwise, why would it be timing out? I've been seeing these messages
shortly before a hardlock (except for the fact numlock still works, but
nothing else) when doing long, intensive hard drive activity. Because my
hard drives are right next to each other, overheat sometimes and shut
straight down when they do. But I'm gonna take a wild guess it's not Linux's
fault, unless they've done some whacky stuff with the elevator ;)
