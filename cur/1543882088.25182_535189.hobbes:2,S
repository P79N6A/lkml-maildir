Dears,
I am not sure if this is the right place for asking such question. If
not, please ignore and if possible, direct me to the right place.
I am trying to rebuilt my kernel patched with the iwlwifi driver. I
downloaded the mac80211 package then I typed make. I got the following
error. Can you help me in solving this error.
Note: I am a noob.
hab@laptop {~/wifi/mac80211-7.0.6}$ sudo make

Checking kernel compatibility in:
        /lib/modules/2.6.20-15-generic/source//
 * Kernel requires compatibility version:
   - Requires class_dev -> dev API compat
   - Requires to_net_dev API compat
   - Requires device_rename compat
Building compatibility version in 'compatible/' directory:
Copying compatible/ from modified/...done
 + Applying: patches/remove_debugfs.patch
        Remove DEBUGFS usage (due to class_dev breakage)
 + Applying: patches/class_dev_to_dev-wireless.patch
        Reverse class_dev to dev changes
 + Applying: patches/add_to_net_dev.patch
        Add to_net_dev back in (newer kernels have it in netdevice.h)
 + Applying: patches/fix-qos-sysfs-no-class_dev.patch

 + Applying: patches/nl80211-remove-kconfig.patch
        Remove nl80211 from being an option in Kconfig
 + Applying: patches/device_rename.patch
        The ability to rename devices requires device_rename so we can't use it.
