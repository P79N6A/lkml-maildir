So how can you do double word access when the length is not a multiple of four? 
The current x86-64 copy_from_user will use double work access even in that case,
except for the end of course.
But what you're doing is so deeply unportable it's not funny. I am not
sure such a unportable driver even belongs in the kernel.
If the code was really intended to run on user space addresses it 
was totally broken btw because it didn't handle exceptions.
