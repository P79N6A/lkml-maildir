Because it can be incredibly complicated, bloated, and difficult to coordinate 
with the corresponding user-space tools.

Enough to have had the idea shot down a year-and-a-half ago. EVMS did 
in-kernel volume discovery at one point, but the driver was enormous. Let's 
just say we finally "saw the light" and redesigned to do user-space 
discovery. Trust me, it works much better that way.

I guess I simply don't understand the desire to partition MD devices when 
putting LVM on top of MD provides *WAY* more flexibility. You can resize any 
volume in your group, as well as add new disks or raid devices in the future 
and expand existing volumes across those new devices. All of this is quite a 
pain with just partitions.
And setting up an init-ramdisk to run the tools isn't that hard. EVMS even 
provides pre-built init-ramdisks with the EVMS tools which has worked for 
virtually all of our users who want their root filesystem on an EVMS volume. 
It really is fairly simple, and I run three of my own computers this way. If 
you'd like to give it a try, I'd be more than happy to help you out.
