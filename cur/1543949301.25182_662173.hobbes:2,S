Hi there, 
I started hacked DVG-G1402S device, I find out console pinout, and datashet 
for Infineon PEB 3332. Is there anybody who would write driver for it and 
help me get linux run on this device?
My findings are at 
http://daisy.servodata.cz/~cijoml/D-link_DVG-G1402S-inside/
and I saved datasheet for infineon chipset also there:
Thanks for help!
Michal
