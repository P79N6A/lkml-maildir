if i were a big monopolistic company that has recently (openly) began 
to worry about the threat of linux taking some of my market share, i 
would create an explosive topic on the kernel mailing list and begin 
dividing up the developers using political agenda such as this. little 
by little, the cracks in the foundation would start giving way to 
larger debates. finally, simple ideology would create a divide that 
causes the developers to choose "sides" and then fragmentation would 
occur. the ultimate outcome: the unix syndrome. perhaps this is not 
such a case, but it may as well be from what i have read. sometimes 
not giving your opinion is worth more than winning a debate. think 
about it.
