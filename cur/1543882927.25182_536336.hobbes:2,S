OK, I've been sitting on this in the hope that I'll suddenly see the
light and work out what you're talking about - but apparently that's not
going to happen.  So, some questions:
   1. Does this patch change the dom0 <-> domU interface?  or does it
      fix something that's currently broken?
   2. Can just apply the netfront part to the pv_ops kernel, or does it
      require the corresponding dom0 patch to be applied as well?
Thanks,
    J
