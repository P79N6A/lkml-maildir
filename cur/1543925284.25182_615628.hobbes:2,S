Ah, but it's not just software:  when trying to find bus address
space for the BAR, we don't know if we are stomping on magic hardware
resources the BIOS has conveniently failed to tell us about.
So while in all likelihood you will have no problem finding a
suitable bus address to use, as a generalized rule it is a far more
difficult proposition.
Mind you, I would /love/ to be proven wrong here.  In additional to AHCI
BAR, modern ata_piix includes SATA PHY registers that we could make use
of, but cannot...
