Hi Remy,
This would have been better to send this as two separate
patches. They are two different issues.

This is from Gregory Haskins' patch. He forgot to compile check for

Yeah, I'll look into it since I wrote that usage ;-)
Greg,
Can you merge the first part into your patch and resend it to me.
I'll look at the second one.
Thanks,
