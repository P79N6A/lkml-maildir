I was having the same problem. The PPP link would just stall after a while
and never come back. The link was up, and tcpdump showed a lot of ACK's
going out, but nothing coming in. On a whim, I turned off DMA on my IDE
hard drive, and the stalls have not come back (yet). But, I may just be 
having a run of good luck.
