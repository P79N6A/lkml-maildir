Not to mention the "breeding" affect. A bug that many people have seen
only once, but can never pinpoint because they can't reproduce it. One
of those people reports the problem to the mailing list, and suddenly
half a dozen respond with "me too, but here's some extra info that I
saw". You can't get that with a bug database.
