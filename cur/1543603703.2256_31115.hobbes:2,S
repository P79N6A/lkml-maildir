There *is* a race on x86 - the problem is that the primary cpu can 
get to reschedule_idle before the secondarys have done init_idle.
I'm not claiming the way I fixed it is beautiful, but the race definitely
exists (I hit it) and the patch makes the problem go away. 
Sounds like rep_nop was the wrong way to spin - aplogies.
Martin.
