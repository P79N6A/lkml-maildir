Ok, but how can I specify the filename you'll give to the patch?
It would make management between my tree and yours easier for me, if possible.

If you want to add the dependency to SCSI, GENERIC_ISA_DMA and every item in 
arch/um/Kconfig_scsi by hand, you're welcome, but I guess not :-).
Otherwise, please note I bracketed everything with if BROKEN....endif. If you 
don't like the indent, that's not a problem.
