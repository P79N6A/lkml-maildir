'quilt push -a' fails with:
Applying patch synclink_gt-enable-ri-interrupt.patch
patching file drivers/char/synclink_gt.c
Hunk #1 FAILED at 1.
Hunk #2 FAILED at 89.
2 out of 7 hunks FAILED -- rejects in file drivers/char/synclink_gt.c
Patch synclink_gt-enable-ri-interrupt.patch does not apply (enforce with -f)
Handing that one line in the series file a '#' made quilt happy.
