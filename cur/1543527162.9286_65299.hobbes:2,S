Thanks a lot, this helped. The kernel now boots.
But with the standard redhat-6.1 boot scripts, the machine hangs
at "Loading sound modules", and then after a couple of seconds
it drops into the prom console, but without restoring the framebuffer,
i.e. I cannot read what I type into the console.
I've deleted the audio.o and dbri.o modules, doesn't help.
