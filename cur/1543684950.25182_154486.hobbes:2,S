There is a bug in old kmail versions wherein they do silly things if the
filesystem alleges that its optimum I/O size is much larger than 4k.
2.6's reiserfs tell applications that its optimum IO size is 128k, and the
bug bites.
Try mounting your reiserfs filesystems with the "nolargeio" option.
A `mount -o remount,nolargeio' will probably work too.
Please test that, send a report, and if it fixes it, upgrade your kmail.
Thanks.
