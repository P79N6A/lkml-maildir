I forget ;) There seemed to be rather a lot of 64-bit addition with no
obvious locking in sight, that's all.

It may have been designed for 64-bit, but was that the correct design?  The
cost on 32-bit appears to be pretty high.  Perhaps a round of uninlining
will help.

That would serve to explain the 18% growth on x86_64.  But why did i386
grow by much more: 29%?  I'd be suspecting all the new 64-bit arithmetic.
