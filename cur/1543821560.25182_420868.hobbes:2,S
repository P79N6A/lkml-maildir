Any can you add that please and check? 
Also worst case one could dump last branch pointers. AMD unfortunately only has four,
on Intel with 16 it's easier.
I can provide a patch for that if needed.

Yes it probably should check for that.

That can cause recursive exceptions. I'm a bit paranoid with that.
