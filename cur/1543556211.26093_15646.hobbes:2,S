> computer: Chipset 430FX / Triton / PIIX, disk Western Digital Caviar AC21600H Firmware code F6 (no UDMA, some WD docs show DMA mw2, some PIO4...), kernel 2.2.17 with ide patch and PIIX enabled, DMA by default, generic DMA, and couple others. Did not try 'bad DMA-firmware (EXPERIMENTAL)'. dmesg (relevant - in my view - lines):

Running a basically similar system here, DataExpert 8551, with a modified Award (was originally an ami) bios from

.
Chipset is a 430FX, Same hard drive as what you have.  Pentium 133, 48 meg ram.  Kernel 2.2.17 with raid patch, and ide patch.  Shares the ide cable with a WDC 850 meg drive as slave.

so my firmware is actually one version older than yours, and allows me to set DMA.  And has the associated speed increase/lower cpu
