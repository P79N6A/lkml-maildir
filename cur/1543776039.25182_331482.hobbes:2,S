Hi,
Today I decided to try Ingo's rt-preempt patch on 2.6.12 (V0.7.51-02). I'm 
most interested in the CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT mode, so I selected this option 
instead of the others. I enabled a couple of the debugging options, but I 
wasn't totally clear on which options are most useful, so I just enabled the 
ones that didn't have a warning about significant overhead, namely..
CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP=y
CONFIG_WAKEUP_TIMING=y
CONFIG_CRITICAL_TIMING=y
CONFIG_LATENCY_TIMING=y
Additionally (by mistake) I enabled:
CONFIG_CRITICAL_IRQSOFF_TIMING=y
Which does mention overhead.
Which debugging options are most useful for testing purposes? Is what I've 
selected enough? Also, I got a few unexpected messages in dmesg on bootup. 
Firstly;
spawn_desched_task(00000000)
desched cpu_callback 3/00000000
ksoftirqd started up.
softirq RT prio: 24.
ksoftirqd started up.
softirq RT prio: 24.
[...]
desched cpu_callback 2/00000000
desched thread 0 started up.
softlockup thread 0 started up.
Why does it print out the same ksoftirqd message six times? Is this expected 
behaviour? Next, I got a warning about CONFIG_CRITICAL_IRQSOFF_TIMING;
should this option be enabled?
Finally, I got this:
BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#0!

I think it's when my scripts try to set up the IrDA port; the script runs the 
following (I have a weird broken NC6000 IrDA port which needs messing around 
with to work)..
/usr/bin/smcinit -v -s 0x3E8 -f 0x130 -i 4 -d 3 >/dev/null
Of course, the message could've just been coincidental, as it doesn't actually 
refer to the smcs driver at all.
I set preempt_max_latency to zero, but the only messages I've got back from 
the kernel so far are:
( softirq-timer/0-3    |#0): new 3 us maximum-latency wakeup.
( softirq-timer/0-3    |#0): new 1003 us maximum-latency wakeup.
( softirq-timer/0-3    |#0): new 1001 us maximum-latency wakeup.
Which is presumably a good sign.
