Call it SMP or kernel threading, I don't really care, it's the same
thing. My point is that in the kernel you must take threading/SMP into
account when coding and yes it's not trivial to do it efficiently
(though often fairly easy to do it inefficiently) and the same applies
to userland threads. Userland threads are just not some chest of gold
that just opens up a free path to paradise as most CS teachers seems
to promote it as being.
