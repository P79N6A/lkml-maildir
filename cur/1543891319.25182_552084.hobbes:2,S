Luck, or enough other issues someone hasn't tracked their problems
down to this.  On the pure cpu hotplug path I just got a bug
report about it not working:  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/31/419
So apparently real people can hit this one.  Not just theoretical
people seen by code reviewers.
The code is broken by design and cannot be made to support existing
x86 SMP systems.  Please find a way to use something that works.
The suspend path is already talking to the drivers and can stop IRQs
at their source so it should not be a big deal.
