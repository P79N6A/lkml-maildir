Nope.  To unmap a page, full rmap has to scan 100 pte_chain slots, which is 3
cachelines worth.  objrmap has to scan 10,000 vma's, 9,900 of which do not map
that page at all.
(Actually, there's a recent optimisation in objrmap which will on average
halve these figures).

What do you mean by this?  vmtruncate continues to use the 2.4 algorithm for
that.

Andrea, I whine about rmap as much as anyone ;) I'm the guy who halved both
its speed and space overhead shortly after it was merged.
But the fact is that it is not completely useless overhead.  It provides a
very robust VM which is stable and predictable under extreme and unusual
loads.  That is valuable.
Yes, rmap adds a few% speed overhead - up to 10% for things which are
admittedly already very inefficient.
objrmap will reclaim a lot of that common-case overhead.  But the cost of
that is apparently unviability for certain workloads on certain machines. 
Once you hit 100k VMA's it's time to find a new operating system.
Maybe that is a tradeoff we want to make.  I'm adding some balance here.
The space consumption of rmap is a much more serious problem than the speed
overhead.  It makes some workloads on huge ia32 machines unviable.
Me, I have never seen any evidence that we need any of it.  I have never seen
a demonstration of the alleged failure modes of 2.4's virtual scan.  But then
I haven't tried very hard.
The extreme stability and scalability of full rmap is good.  The space
consumption on highmem is bad.  The CPU cost is much less important than
these things.
