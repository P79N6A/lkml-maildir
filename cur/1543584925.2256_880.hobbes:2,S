So it is garbage in the "i_size_high" field (=i_dir_acl) in the inode.

Luckily, after the symlink is created it ignores the size, and only uses
the i_blocks count to determine if the symlink is stored in the inode
itself or in another block (the fast symlink will be NUL terminated).
It could well have been corruption from a long time ago, and only with
2.4.x and LFS you have noticed it.
Probably e2fsck needs to be updated to check for and fix this problem -
it is impossible for a symlink to be larger than a single block, so
the i_size_high field should always be zero.
Cheers, Andreas
