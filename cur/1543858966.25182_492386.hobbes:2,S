No. This is wrong.
It's wrong exactly because it now _breaks_ the whole thing that the 2.6.19 
PG_dirty changes were all about: keeping track of dirty pages. Now you 
have a page that is dirty, but it's no longer marked PG_dirty, and thus it 
doesn't participate in the dirty accounting.

So not only are you breaking this, you also claim that it cannot happen in 
the first place. So either the patch is buggy, or it's pointless. In 
neither case does it seem to be a good idea to do.
