Yes, we are claiming fuse is very special in this regard, and perhaps
even broken.
Let's see. If I SIGSTOP the fuse server, I can get unrelated tasks
unkillable (even for SIGKILL!) forever. That's very special, and maybe
even a FUSE bug. And that is also what makes FUSE special
w.r.t. s2ram.
So no, you can't claim "FUSE is just IPC". It is very special IPC.
