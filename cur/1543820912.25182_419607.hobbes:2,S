You're not allowed to throw exceptions from inside the stack unwinding 
caused by another exception, terminate() gets called in this case. In 
most cases this isn't too hard to avoid, you just have to ensure that 
exceptions don't get thrown out of destructors. Your example isn't very 
good, why would you throw an exception in that case? The caller isn't 
going to be able to do anything useful with it since it's because of a 
coding bug, some kind of assert or BUG() would be more logical.
