We talked about that, but the thing is, if we make the functionality
conditional, nobody will ever use it :-/
So, yes, in a perfect world that would indeed make sense. However since
nobody ever uses these [fm]advise calls,..
So the big question is, does this functionally hurt any workload? If it
turns out it does (which I still doubt) then we might hide it behind
knobs, otherwise I'd like to keep it always on.
