Every task has a pid, and since interrupt code is executed by the current
task in kernel mode, interrupt code has a pid.
It's the same concept implemented in NT's CRITICAL_SECTIONs : a process can
call more times EnterCriticalSection() provided that it calls the same
number of LeaveCriticalSection().
Cheers,
