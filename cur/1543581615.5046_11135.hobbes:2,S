That will check all the packages seem sane. It won't neccessarily help 
identify the problem but can reassure you as what if anything may be corrupt.
If it shows up changes in login, netstat, su and the like then assume the worst.
If it shows permission changes on the library then you have a good idea what
may have happened.
You might also want to look at ps -aux and top data as that may give you a lot
of clues if the machine is apparently behaving but being odd
