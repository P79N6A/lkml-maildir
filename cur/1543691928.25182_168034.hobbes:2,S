What protocols are you referring to?
RFC 822, section 3.4.7, makes clear that case is _not_ significant for
these field names.  RFC 2822 doesn't change this.
Just because no commonly used E-Mail application seems to generate
uppercase field names, how do you know something like a password
auto-responder script won't?
That may not be a concern for you, but please don't spread
mis-information to others.
John.
