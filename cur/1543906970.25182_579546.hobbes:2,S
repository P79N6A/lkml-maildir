no - it was not a double patch, i made all the common variants valid 
boot options: "relatime", "relatime=0/1", "norelatime" and 
"norelatime=0/1". Anyway, this is mooth, in the latest (v2) version 
there's only a single boot parameter.

relatime is a mount option already. And distros can disable it if they 
want. (they are conscious about their kernel config selections anyway.)
