Ahhh... so there is a way to get rid of that cursed message.  I forgot to mention this in my original message, the only place that I had seen this problem is on a certain machine (Dell 2950) with a certain distribution (FC6) kernel.  I had trimmed the code down to fit in 4K stacks already quite a bit.
I believe what actually made it crash and overflow the stack (the straw that breaks the camels back, so to speak) was the intermittent triggering of the softlockup detector.  I think if I can disable that while the firmware is loading that will fix the stack overflow issues and correct my problem.
