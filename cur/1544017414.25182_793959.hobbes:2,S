The thing I don't like about the prealloc method is that it puts the
page-aligned variables at the end.  This leaves a gap which is
unavailable for dynamic allocations.  Stealing 48 bytes from the
bottom of the irqstack (which is 16k) keeps the page-aligned section
at the start.  It's really no different than how the thread_info
structure sits at the bottom of the process stack.
How about something like:
union irq_stack_union {
	char irq_stack[IRQSTACKSIZE];
	struct {
		char pad[40];
		unsigned long stack_canary;
	}
};
That documents the overlay better, and avoids having to touch the linker script.
