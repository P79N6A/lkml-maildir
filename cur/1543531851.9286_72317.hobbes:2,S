That is precisely the reason that I don't like the patch.
There are many keyboards (Microsoft Internet, Logitech Internet
etc etc) that have lots of keys, but not these three.
Since there are very few spare keycodes and several keyboards
that need up to twenty new keycodes, it is unavoidable that
there is re-use of keycodes.
Thus, if you think of some application, and part of the configuration
procedure of that application is fixing a few keycodes, that is fine.
But if you build these in into the kernel, then these are no longer
free for other uses.
And before talking about these - the three Microsoft Windows keys
are much more common, and by some coincidence I gave them a fixed
keycode long ago. Are there common generic uses? What standard
sequences would you like to assign to them, and why?
