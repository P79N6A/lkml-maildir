Unfortunately, my take on the scheme used to reserve space for CardBus
bridges was that it only works on platforms that use the setup-*.c code
to do their complete PCI subsystem initialization.  On platforms like
x86, where the BIOS configures all the devices, something like my patch
is needed to fixup things to handle the desired reservation.  I'm not
finished getting things ported to 2.5 yet, I'll post a patch ASAP once
I've got everything workin.  If you're keen on devising an alternative
method, check put my old patch against 2.4.19 at:

Cool, that definitely will make my life easier.
Thanks,
