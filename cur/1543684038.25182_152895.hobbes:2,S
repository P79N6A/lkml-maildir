I don't agree.  The stock kernel is a work in progress, and things get
broken from time to time as a normal part of development.  Experienced
users will realise that, and I wouldn't encourage inexperienced users
to compile their own kernel from the stock trees anyway, because they
could easily miss bugfixes, including data corruption and security
ones, simply because they assume that they are in the mainline
kernel.
Compiling your own kernel from the stock kernel trees is still
something that should be considered for experienced users only.
Besides, what's worse?  Possible data corruption or a bad impression?

The name BROKEN_ON_SMP implies that if you don't set it, what's left
is known to work on SMP.  In a lot of cases, it'll actually be
untested on SMP.
