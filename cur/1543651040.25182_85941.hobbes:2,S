I booted the Debian hack of 2.4.18 and got a little bit more 
informative set of debug messages:
ncr53c810-0: waiting 10 seconds for SCSI devices to settle...
freeing devtbl    [8192] @fffffc0000dee000
scsi0: ncr53c8xx-3.4.3b-20010512
ncr53c810-0-<0,0>: CMD=12 ncr53c810-0: command processing resumed
ncr53c810-0-<0,0>: CMD=12 <6>ncr53c810-0-<0,0>: ccb \
    @fffffc0000de8000 using tag 255
ncr53c810-0: queuepos=3.
scsi : aborting command due to timeout: pid 0, scsi0, channel \
    0, id 0, lun 0 Inquiry 00 00 00 ff 00
ncr53c8xx_abort: pid=0 serial_number=1 serial_number_at_timeout=1
ncr53c810-0: abort ccb=fffffc0000de8000 (cancel)
...and again, that's all she wrote.
Would anyone know where to find the actual maintainer for the 
ncr53c8xx driver?  It would appear to be Gerard Roudier, but I'd 
like to make sure before bugging him directly...
