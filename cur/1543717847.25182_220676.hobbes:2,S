Looks like we need six system calls if we're going to do it that way.
All that marshalling and unmarshalling code is a bit evil.  I wonder if
there's some way in which it can be flattened out.
One option would be to present all the info to userspace as a virtual
filesystem, although it would be a bit weird that the contents of the
"files" depends upon the process which reads them.
Maybe a mkdir() on that filesystem could create a directory which contains
files which contain the counters for the process which made the directory? 
The directory would need to be auto-rmdir'ed on process exit.  It's
basically the same semantics as /proc/pid.
But /proc/pid can be read by processes other than "pid".  Does the same
apply to the perfcntr instrumentation?  (Being able to read another
process's perfcntr info sounds useful.  Is it?)
