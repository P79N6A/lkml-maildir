I dunno how Lindows manage the release process,
but as I already wrote in a different thread, I don't unserstand why
the linux kernel release process can't be supported by a suite of test
that has to be passed before being released a new -rc or final
version.
It seems there are now the all the tools we need but we are note using
them to manage the releases.
I'm referring to LTP, compile stats and regression test from OSDL.
Ciao,
