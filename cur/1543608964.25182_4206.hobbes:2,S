ext3 will reply the root file systems journal on boot when the kernel
mounts root.  other ext3 partitions will have their journals replayed
when they are mounted.
also, btw, I use RedHat 7.2 and fsck does not run if I don't hit Y.  It
is there for pedants or seriously screwed disks -- the journal replay
should be sufficient.
