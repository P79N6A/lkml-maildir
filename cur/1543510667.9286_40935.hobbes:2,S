Books are static. The kernel is not. Given the current rate of kernel
development, books on it are outdated almost as soon as they hit the
shelves. What good is a basic introduction if it's outdated and
therefore wrong?
_Linux Device Drivers_ is a good book. I like it. Unfortunately, it
doesn't help very much with 2.2 and 2.3. It's a lot easier to keep
documentation in the kernel tree up to date than it is to keep a
physical book up to date.

Even the internals can have some stability. If I'm writing a set of
modules, which is a better way to spend my time -- chasing after
changes to the kernel interface or making my code better?

Laziness is laziness, and no system can prevent that. Currently we
have "Oh, then I'd have to change everything in the kernel that uses
<foo>". I'm not convinced that adding "and write a paragraph
explaining it" is really a killer task compared to that. Even if the
guy who made the change doesn't want to add that paragraph, someone
else can. What's important is that it exists, not who wrote it.

Why do you think I'm advocating documentation at the expense of
readable code? Argue against my position if you like, but please stop
constructing strawmen. Please show me where I or anyone else claimed
that writing documentation was more important than cleaning up code.
