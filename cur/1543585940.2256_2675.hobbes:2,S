It is, however, normal for the OOM killer to attempt to kill a process more than once - it takes a few scheduler cycles for the SIGKILL to actually reach the process and take effect.

Plase change to 100 to 500 - this would make it consistant with
the useradd command, which starts adding new users at the UID 500
