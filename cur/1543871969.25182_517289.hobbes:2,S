Big oops early in boot on x86_64 SMP, in rq_bitmap_error+0x97/0x9f.
I stubbed it out with a `return MAX_RT_PRIO;' (I think) but it then oopsed
differently.  Before netconsole had come up, no serial console, no digital
camera.
There's stuff in 
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/ck/
 - you can probably
boot that kernel on your own machine.
I need to do rc3-mm1 now.  I might find some time to poke at this
further after that, but I have to leave for a week in .jp and it'll be
squeezy, sorry.
