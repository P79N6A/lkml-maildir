I seriously can't tell if you're deliberately trying to be difficult or
not. It's a simple "replace / with ! before sending the name to procfs."
Reiserfs requests that a procfs directory called
/proc/fs/reiserfs/<blockdev> be created. Some block devices contain
slashes, so with cciss/c123 it attempts to create a directory called
/proc/fs/reiserfs/cciss/c123, but cciss/ doesn't exist, shouldn't, and
never will. In order to create a single path component, "cciss/c123"
becomes "cciss!c123." This is consistent with how sysfs does it now. For
a real example, change the "-" in device mapper block names to "/" and
see what happens.
Regardless, it's already been checked into mainline as change
6fbe82a952790c634ea6035c223a01a81377daf1.
