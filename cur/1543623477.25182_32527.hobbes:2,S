	Good catch. Changed.

	There is a difference. The reviewer of the first submission also
	missed it. path_lookup duplicates walk_init_root because mntget 
	and dget are not called when the dcache_lock is held. So it is not
	an exact copy of walk_init_root. 
	The point of this is to find all the dentries in the path being 
	walked already in the dcache (aka the easy lookups) without bumping 
	the reference counter for every single dentry. On SMP this can lead 
	to cacheline bouncing. When a dentry is not found in the cache then
	call mntget and dget followed by releasing the dcache_lock to continue.
	Al Viro came up with this idea, I have implemented it.
	The lockmeter results and patch are here:
