Yeah, I guess it doesn't make sense to do one-shot iso.

Well, kmalloc has slabs of a fixed size and will round requested amount
to the nearest value. For example on x86 sizeof(struct urb) == 84 which
will be rounded to 96 by kmalloc ie 12 bytes unused (on Sparc64 it's about 
20 bytes).
Also we could use slab constructor to pre-initialize some urb fields.
