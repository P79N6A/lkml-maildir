I just read the code, tried to understand it, translated that
understanding into English, and put that in vfs.txt.
It is very possible that what I wrote didn't match the intention of
the author, but it seemed to match the behaviour of the code.
The patch looks like it makes perfect sense to me.
Before the change, ->writepage could return AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE
without unlocking the page, and this has precisely the effect of:
   ClearPageReclaim();  (if the call path was through pageout)
   SetPageActive();  (if the call was through shrink_page_list)
   unlock_page();
With the patch, the ->writepage method does the SetPageActive and the
unlock_page, which on the whole seems cleaner.
We seem to have lost a call to ClearPageReclaim - I don't know if that
is significant.

Surely the punishment should be for writing hidden undocumented hacks
in the first place!  I vote we just make him maintainer for the whole
kernel - that will keep him so busy that he will never have a chance
to do it again :-)

It seems that the new requirement is that if the address_space
chooses not to write out the page, it should now call SetPageActive().
If that is the case, I think it should be explicit in the
documentation - please?
