Why are you running a SMP kernel on a UP machine?  One solution would be to
run the UP kernel then you won't have any spinlocks :) I don't know of any
SMP PowerStacks if there are any.
The actual cause of the bug you're seeing was p->processor being set badly
in the fork code.  It's fixed in the latest vger and Alan has a patch for
it now.
} Hi,
}   today, during compilation of ncpfs, my Motorola Powerstack box emited
} these messages (and died, of course):
} 
} _spin_lock(c0128494) NIP c0012cd8 holder: cpu0 pc c00123a0
} _spin_lock(c0128494) NIP c0012614 holder: cpu0 pc c00123a0
} _spin_lock(c0128494) NIP c0012614 holder: cpu0 pc c00123a0
} ...
} c0128494 = runqueue_lock
} c0012bfc = schedule (for first NIP)
} c00125e8 = wake_up_process (for second and subsequent NIP)
} c0012318 = reschedule_idle (for pc)
