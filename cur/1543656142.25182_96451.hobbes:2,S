Consider, you are not sure what kexec has been setup to do (maybe 
some other admin has something setup to take a crash dump etc).  You 
do not want to destroy this setup, so you do kexec -q  
Think being able to query the pending kexec is very usefull.  Also
using an rc means that scripts can use it too.
