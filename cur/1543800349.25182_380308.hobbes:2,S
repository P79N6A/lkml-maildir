it recalls me bad memories on my machine a very long time ago when the
driver was buggy :-(
It's not necessarily bad hardware. I also had trouble on one version
of the 29160 bios where it hanged during device scan if there were
too many terminations. Oh, BTW, please check that you have disabled
"automatic" termination in the BIOS. Manually set it either to ON or
OFF (low/high depending on your setup).

Not much. Perhaps at worst, a failing controller could corrupt memory
by writing garbage at wrong locations, but you would not always get
the same messages. It seems to be a different problem here. To be
honnest, it's where I think you should try the new driver.
