	/dev/random  is blocking interface that only gives as much
		     random bytes as it estimates there to be entropy.
		     Then it blocks until more entropy has been collected
		     from the system
	/dev/urandom  is non-blocking interface, which will happily
		     delpete the entropy pool to supply you random bytes.
