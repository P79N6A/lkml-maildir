The kernel source has notes on various things supported but not that I
am aware of a neat list (and in my experience people will claim bogus
ones too - eg many vendors claim to fully support RFC1122, which
requires you stack can leap tall buildings in a single bound).
For the higher level stuff like OSPF, BGP you need to look at user space
packages like quagga because they are not implemented by the kernel in
the Linux case but by user space applications.
