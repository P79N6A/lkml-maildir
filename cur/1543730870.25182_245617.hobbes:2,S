Yes, of cousre.

Yes, there's no module infrastructure there. These "plugins" need to be
linked at compile time. Some plugins need to be anyway since the the
filesystem is useless without them. Others whould be optional features.

Right. The name is probably at bit misleading. But assuming the
compression "plugin" whould be dynamically loadable at some later point
it would be a plugin then?
