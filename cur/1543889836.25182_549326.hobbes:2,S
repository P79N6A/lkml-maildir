I'd agree entirely with Dave - if you are applying a fix to something
that is currently totally broken which may make it work and which doesn't
affect any other bit of code then it goes into the stable tree.
Absolutes like "no xyz in the stable tree" don't work in the real world
with real users. Intelligence does.
