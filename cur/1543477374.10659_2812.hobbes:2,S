None of this emulation will be necessary under linux.  Because linux programs,
even games, use the device drivers exclusively.
I hope a linux driver will be written to use the chip as-is, and not
do any sort of useless emulation that only waste CPU time.
Emulation may be useful for those who run dos games with DOSEMU/WINE, but 
certainly
not for any of the many linux programs that use sound.  Such emulation
should be part of those packages, not a driver.

Another reason for not using emulation then.  Many linux machines use the VIA 
chipset.

Difficult on broken platforms like DOS, yes.  No problem on linux as there
is no such thing as "soundblaster compatibility" there.
Linux users appreciate the effort to make a good driver.  In order to achieve this
goal, be aware of some differences in the linux world:
- Hardware backwards compatibility is mostly a non-issue, 
  no programs ever depends on the hardware anyway.  This because we don't want to be 
  tied to a specific vendor. 
- A hardware vendor may succeed on merit.  Good hardware, well-working efficient
  drivers that arrives on time is the way to go.
- Open source is appreciated.   Open development is even better - you can have people
  sending in patches for bugfixes and performance enhancements.
  You can of course be the central authority on your own driver - but accepting
  improvements from outside is generally a good thing.
- Writing a driver supporting every feature takes time - this is understood.
  But there is no reason for delaying the release until that.
  I recommend going for the basic /dev/dsp (D/A A/D converters) first,
  and release a beta as soon as that works.  Then make new releases whenever
  a new feature (midi, mixer, ...) is completed.
