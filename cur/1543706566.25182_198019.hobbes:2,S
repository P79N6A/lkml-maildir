Some updates for cpqarray. It seems cpqarray in kernel 2.6.1 corresponds
to the one in 2.4.18, so here's the updates from 2.4.19 onward
Summary of updates:
- Modify contact info and version number
- Fix for segmentation fault when rmmod is called.
- New variables io_mem_addr and io_mem_length to replace ioaddr.
- Use PCI APIs (pci_register_driver, pci_unregister_driver, etc).
Support for EISA cards is also included.
- Check rc of pci_register_driver()
To do:
- import 2.4.x updates for ioctl.
Thanks
