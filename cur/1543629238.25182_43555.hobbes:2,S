Well actually the logical place to do it is in modutils. Which is where
we do it right now. We even precompute dependancies with depmod much like
the dynamic link caches

Actually for dynamic stuff the application also does some of it for late
binding and when triggers are used for relations between packages
All of which says the current modutils method is correct
