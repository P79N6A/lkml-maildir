Do you really need to make suspend a module to achieve this? I'll freely  
admit it might be nice to save a little bit of memory by modularising it,  
and it might save Pavel and I a reboot or two while developing, but for  
what you're after, couldn't you just move the call that starts resuming?

LVM can be compiled in, can't it? Does it need to do some setup from an  
initrd?

So long as the initrd doesn't mount any filesystems that were suspended,  
you should be okay, IIRC.
