Subject: RFC: /proc key naming consistency

I would like to hear people's opinions on making the keys in the /proc 
hierarchy consistent wrt the space character. The current Linux 
Documentation/filesystems.proc.txt does not suggest any standard naming 
conventions. F.E. cat /proc/cpuinfo 
(partial list)
cpu family      : 5
model           : 9
model name      : AMD-K6(tm) 3D+ Processor
stepping        : 1
cpu MHz         : 400.907
cache size      : 256 KB
fdiv_bug        : no
hlt_bug         : no
f00f_bug        : no
Notice the space between "cpu" and "MHz", or "cpu" and "family" yet there is 
no space between "fdiv" and "bug" (_).
The reason I think NOT using a space is a good idea because it makes life 
easier for developers parsing /proc entries. Specifically, Java developers 
could use /proc/cpuinfo as a property file, but the space in the 'key' breaks 
java.util.Properties.load(). 
Fire away...
