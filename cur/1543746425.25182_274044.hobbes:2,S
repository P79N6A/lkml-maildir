i agree that it's arbitrary. There are two reasons for the ordering:
1) _usually_ the IRQs that get registered first are the 'more important'
    ones. E.g. timer and keyboard interrupts will preempt the IDE
    interrupt.  This is in no way a generic thing though.
2) testing: if all IRQs are at the same priority level then alot less 
   inter-IRQ preemption occurs, and testing coverage is lower. With all 
   irqs on different levels the bugs will trigger sooner.
To solve this cleanly some userspace policy code is needed that would
take some settings (e.g. sound_highprio) through which the priority
setup could be configured. It's not a simple task as that could would
have to discover the type of devices that are in the system and their
irqs - possibly a component of udev could do this?
