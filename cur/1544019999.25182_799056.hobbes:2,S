hm, if you worry about that aspect: we could make it seemlessly enabled if 
PM_DEBUG is enabled.

This argument is 100% mystery to me. Do you really not see the quality 
difference between a stack trace generated _right at the buggy piece of 
code_ and a warning later on that might (or might not) trigger?
Especially considering that your approach wont catch such bugs:
   ...
   spin_unlock_irq();
   ...
   spin_lock_irq();
   ...
Or such bugs:
   local_irq_enable();
   ...
   local_irq_disable();
Or such bugs:
   spin_lock_irq_save(&lock1, flags);
   ...
           spin_lock_irqsave(&lock2, flags);
           ...
           spin_unlock_irq(&lock2);          /* accidental bug */
   ...
   spin_unlock_irq_restore(&lock1, flags);
Such types of bugs might be especially hard to find in practice, if the 
window where irqs are enabled is small. There is no guarantee at all that 
accidental irq enabling survives a critical section - it can be 
re-disabled in the normal flow of things very easily.
And even if we are lucky and if the irqs stay enabled by the time the 
callback returns, what if your warning flags some big and complex driver, 
one line of which is buggy?
If you had the choice, what would you prefer - a stack dump done at the 
point of incident (pinpointing the driver, the subsystem and the buggy 
function with its full callframe), or your "this driver is buggy" generic 
warning with no specificity about where that bug might be?
Stacktraces _at the point of incident_, and a _guaranteed_ facility that 
_enforces_ that irqs are off during the whole resume cycle are just about 
the highest quality debug info and debug protection we can get in such 
situations.
I really dont understand your points about this.
