But others can also reduce the reservation.  Also, the code sets and
clears *sk->sk_prot->memory_pressure nonatomically with respect to the
reads of sk->sk_prot->memory_allocated, so in fact the code doesn't
guarantee any particular relationship between the two.
That code looks like a beautiful example of buggy, racy code where
someone has sprinkled magic fix-the-races dust (otherwise known as
atomic_t) around in a vain attempt to fix the races.
That's assuming that all that stuff actually performs any useful
purpose, of course, and that there isn't some lock held by the
callers.  In the latter case it is pointless using atomic_t.
Paul.
