I have a patch around that does this (against RedHat's backported O(1)).
Forward porting it should be no more difficult that creating it in the first
place :)  I was waiting until after 2.6.x was more stable to offer it.

This could be added to my patch.
What my patch added was a sched_setprocstate() syscall, which lets you set a
CPU's run state.  Currently I support:
ENABLED - run any task
RESTRICTED - run only tasks with (cpus_allowed == 1 << cpu)
ISOLATED - run only tasks with
	(cpus_allowed == 1 << cpu && cpus_allowed_mask == 1 << cpu)
