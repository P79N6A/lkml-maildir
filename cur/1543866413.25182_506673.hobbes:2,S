I don't want to have two separate device trees in the kernel (well, one
big device tree and a bunch of little class_device trees.)  The code
duplication in the class_device code is just too much, and I get
questions all the time as to what the differences are.
With these slow and gradual changes, we are getting a true, unified,
device tree, and it will reduce the amount of code and complexity we
need to maintain and fix in the driver core itself.
And it should also alow for proper power management functionality, using
the changes that Linus put into the driver core about 8 months ago.
Don't worry, I have input patches queued up next for you Dmitry :)
