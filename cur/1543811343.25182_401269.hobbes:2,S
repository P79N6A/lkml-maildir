Agreed, most common configs don't spew too many warnings, but that
doesn't mean the warnings for the uncommon cases shouldn't be fixed.

you are dead on :
$ grep "EMBEDDED=y" *.config | wc -l
50

Let's get to work then :)
Actually I already send a few patches for a few errors and I plan to
send many more.

Better yet, let's fix the warnings.

I agree it's not too bad for most people. The point of my post was
mostly a "call to arms" trying to get people interrested in fixing all
the warnings and build errors we have.
There's a lot of focus on implementing new features - and that's great
- but there's little emphasis on fixing the problems we have and
already know about - I'd like to see that change, and my post was
mainly an attempt at making that happen :)
