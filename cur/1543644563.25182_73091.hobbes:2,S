This is a good point that bears highlighting.  Donald Becker's [and thus 
the kernel's] eepro100.c had certain bugs for years, simply because 
access to Intel E100 hardware docs was damn near impossible to obtain.
I don't see driver hardening being very feasible on such drivers, where 
the vendor refuses to allow kernel engineers access needed to get their 
hardware working and stable.  [why vendors want crappy Linux support, 
I'll never know]

P.S.  In all fairness, Intel is doing a really good job maintaining the 
e100 and e1000 drivers nowadays, and e100 docs should be public very 
soon.  [e1000 docs? who knows...]
