You most likely want to use extents in addition to whatever else you use

You're mixing layers here.  MD and DM already work in this area.

There is support for journal on a different device in the generic JBD 
code that ext3 uses, and reiserfs (possibly others also).  That may be a 
good place to work from.
Are there any examples of this in other OSes?  If you put the meta-data 
on a separate drive, it would be an inherently seeky load.  How does 
this compare to putting raid below the mixed data and meta-data block 
device?

Coda and Intermezzo do this in a filesystem independent way already. 
This can add flexibility.

Isn't journaling inherently transaction based already?

This is going to be a very heavy layer, and few people will use it if it 
isn't very light (or can be configured that way)

Journaling in ext3 is block based, and the rest are virtual 
(descriptions of the actions are in the journal, not the entire block of 
meta-data -- when you're not running in data journaling mode).
How do you plan on integrating your proposed layer with these two very 
different approaches to filesystem journaling?

You have a separate userspace, and kernel implementation right?

This can be good or bad.  Make sure it doesn't bloat your layer.
