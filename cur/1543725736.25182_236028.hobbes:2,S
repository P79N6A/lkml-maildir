You missed one important difference:
With a "short 2.7", 2.6 stays unchanged. This way, users have a 2.6 tree 
which will continue to stay unchanged regarding such user-visible 
changes but still gets lots of fixes for several years.
For many users I know it's an important difference whether upgrading 
from 2.6.X to 2.6.Y (with Y > X) has a low risk of breaking anything 
working with 2.6.X or not.
Many people complained after USB_SCANNER was removed in 2.6.3, and the 
only excuse (besides that it had several bugs and was for most users  
inferior to SANE) is that this was very early in the 2.6 series.

I don't disagree with this statement. But IMHO "some point" shouldn't 
be in 2.6 .
