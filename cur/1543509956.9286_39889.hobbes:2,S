well, oplocks is turned on in NT by default. turning them off per the
samba doc had no effect to the problem below
the situation is this..
Server   : NT 4.0sp5. I'm running 3com RADIUS on here in a directory
	   marked sharebale. There's a log file security.log in the
	   directory that's continously written to.
Client   : Linux libc5, current kernel version 2.2.10..current smbmount
	   version 2.0.4.
Procedure: mounting NT shareable directory via smbmount. Checking filesize
	   of security.log file every 3 minutes via program.
Problem  : Filesize does not update in real-time when checked. Not with an
	   ls, not with stat()
