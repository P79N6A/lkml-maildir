His change to do_gettimeofday() will of course slow that path down a
tiny bit since he's adding an extra 'if', but since it's wrapped in
unlikely() and should hit at most one time pr second I would guess the
performance impact of that to be negligible.
The change to sys_time() does away with some local variables and
replaces the call to do_gettimeofday() with a memory barrier and a
simple read of xtime.tv_se. I find it hard to believe (although I have
not tested it) that that wouldn't be faster than the original.
So that's how I came to that conclusion; just reading the patch, going
over what it does in my head and thinking about it a bit.  Not the
most scientific of things I admit.
Even if it is not faster, what would make it slower?  Have you spotted
something I have not?

What did you find strange about it? I'm currious.
Sure it needs testing and of course it would be nice with some more
details on Ingo's test setup.
