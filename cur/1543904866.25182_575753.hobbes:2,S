Hi Al,
> We loop through psm values, calling __l2cap_get_sock_by_addr(psm, ...)
> until we get NULL; then we set ->psm of our socket to htobs(psm).
> IOW, we find unused psm value and put it into our socket.  So far, so
> good, but...  __l2cap_get_sock_by_addr() compares its argument with
> ->psm of sockets.  IOW, the entire thing works correctly only on
> little-endian.  On big-endian we'll get "no socket with such psm"
> on the first iteration, since we won't find a socket with ->psm == 0x1001.
> We will happily conclude that 0x1001 is unused and slap htobs(0x1001)
> (i.e. 0x110) into ->psm of our socket.  Of course, the next time around
> the same thing will repeat and we'll just get a fsckload of sockets
> with the same ->psm assigned.
> 
> Fix: pass htobs(psm) to __l2cap_get_sock_by_addr() there.  All other
> callers are already passing little-endian values and all places that
> store something in ->psm are storing little-endian.

Dave, all four patches are good and should go in sooner than later. If
you want me to put them into my tree first, then I can do that or you
can apply them directly. You choice.

Marcel
