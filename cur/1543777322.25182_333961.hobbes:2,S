When you have (exactly one) VMware's VM with WindowsXP running on the box,
you can track guest's tick frequency changes in `dmesg` as vmmon reports
frequency guest wants while reprogramming /dev/rtc.
Highest frequency I ever saw is 2.6 Linux with local APIC - it needs 2kHz, as
1kHz timer from 8253 and from local APIC are shifted appart by exactly half
of their period.
