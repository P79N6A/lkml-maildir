Hi Andrea.
Some times ago I found a race in buffer code - many filesystems do
getblk();mark_buffer_uptodate(); and then write to buffer. If the buffer
is under read i/o, written data are lost.
You created a patch for it, but I don't see it in kernel. What's the
status of this bug? Did anyone found that the race can't happen?
Is wait_on_buffer needed after getblk? I think yes, but no filesystem is
doing it.
