I've had two reboots with my otherwise stable 2.2.13pre6+LinuxDirector kernel and
they seem to have happened due to modprobe or something running modprobe failing
to find what it was looking for:
Sep 12 22:46:39 psa4 modprobe: can't locate module block-major-3
Sep 12 22:46:41 psa4 last message repeated 6 times
Sep 12 22:47:04 psa4 init: Switching to runlevel: 6
Sep 12 19:39:39 psa4 modprobe: can't locate module block-major-3
Sep 12 23:38:36 psa4 last message repeated 7 times
Sep 12 19:46:14 psa4 syslogd 1.3-3: restart.
Sep 12 23:49:22 psa4 modprobe: can't locate module block-major-3
Sep 12 23:49:24 psa4 last message repeated 6 times
Sep 12 23:49:55 psa4 init: Switching to runlevel: 6
One survival:
Sep 13 00:08:27 psa4 modprobe: can't locate module block-major-3
Sep 13 00:08:29 psa4 last message repeated 6 times
Sep 13 00:10:00 psa4 kernel:  arp_send: src_ip: 216.33.104.139, dest_ip:
216.33.104.139
(That last message is from some debugging printk's I added to arp.c.  It wasn't in
the earlier kernel runs.)
(I think you can ignore the time problems, something's broken with ntp or the
motherboard time after a reboot.)
Could be just coincidence.
