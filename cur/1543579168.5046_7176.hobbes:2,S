I ment that if the partiton has no persient data on it then the test can
be run (the test wipes all data on the partition out during the test,
right?) with no loss of data on the machine. The partition is still on the
same disk so the test data is valid?
I am thinking that the test is somewhat like badblocks -w or have I got
the wrong end of the stick?
