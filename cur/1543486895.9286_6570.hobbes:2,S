I've got two pretty stable K6's here:
a 200 MHz .35u K6, running at 2x 100 MHz (200 MHz)
a 266 MHz .25u K6-2 w/ CXT core, running at 4.5x 83 MHz (373 MHz)
With good cooling, and little more voltage they both run fine, and the first
managed at least a week of (heavy load) continuous uptime (well, I update my
kernel quite often), and the other a couple days (being a dual boot computer
with an other operating system).
Of course, both run pretty well at their standard settings, too.
And, they are in VA-503+'s.
