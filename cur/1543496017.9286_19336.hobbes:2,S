So it is only trivial to steal a few capabilites. Gee.
The hole goes something like this:
You grant a script the ability to do X, Y, and Z.
I invoke it through a symlink that I control.
The kernel starts up the interpreter you specified.
(this interpreter now has X, Y, and Z abilities)
I change the symlinks while your interpreter is loading.
Your interpreter runs my script with X, Y, and Z abilities.
Sure, I didn't get UID 0 right away. I did get the capabilites
that you were trying to protect though, and it wasn't even hard.
