they do? That's news to me. I've worked at a vendor for almost 5 years,
3 1/2 years of which I was the person who decided on the configs (with
external input of course). In those 3 1/2 years I *never* looked at
defconfig. *never*. And I don't expect other vendor kernel owners to do
things differently; when a config option needs deciding you look at the
description and pick a good value. That's it. Defconfig doesn't matter.
