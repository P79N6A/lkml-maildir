I'm sure he's well aware of the consequences of posting to this list, as 
I'm sure we all are. Hell, even *I* know all my mails to this list are 
going to be archived for eternity.
Look, if you want to be a productive member of our community, stop 
bitching about the way things *should* be, and submit some patches like 
everyone else. Code talks. Bullshit ... well, it doesn't do much but sit 
around stinking the place up.
