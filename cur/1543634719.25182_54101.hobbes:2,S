Hi Bartek. Nice to see that you picked up on the idea
of code duplication reduction. I think the solution to
the packet comand declarations problesm will be to
move them over from cdrom.h to linux/scsi.h and just letting
scsi/scsi.h include linux/scsi.h. This should even make
distros still linking to kernle headers from /usr/include
happy and will achieve the goal of unification.
And I agree with Jens that for pragmatic reasons we should
just keep the prefix from cdrom.h - it's there and doesn't hurt
but we need one, so why not stick with it? The plain macros
from scsi.h are too ambigous anyway.
