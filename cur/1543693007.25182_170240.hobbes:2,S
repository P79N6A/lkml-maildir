Ah, I see. Well, I tested my VIA in another way. I applied this patch, which
adds it to the whitelist. So far it behaves OK. Are there any particular
tests that I can run to make sure?
Also, I want draw your attention to the fact that there DOES exist
a VIA8233-Pre in the wild. Here is my lspci output on my MSI KT266
motherboard:
iris:~ # cat /proc/asound/cards
0 [V8233Pre       ]: VIA8233 - VIA 8233-Pre
                     VIA 8233-Pre at 0xd000, irq 10
iris:~ # lspci -nv -s 00:11.5
00:11.5 Class 0401: 1106:3059 (rev 10)
        Subsystem: 1462:3800
        Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 10
        I/O ports at d000 [size=256]
        Capabilities: [c0] Power Management version 2
And in case it helps, here is the output from /proc/asound/devices:
iris:~ # cat /proc/asound/devices
  1:       : sequencer
  0: [0- 0]: ctl
 17: [0- 1]: digital audio playback
 25: [0- 1]: digital audio capture
 16: [0- 0]: digital audio playback
 24: [0- 0]: digital audio capture
 33:       : timer
Let me know if you need more information.
