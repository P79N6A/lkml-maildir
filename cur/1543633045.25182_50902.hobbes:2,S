you could allocate all the cpu-nr dependend structures during startup,
but then you're limited to the nr of cpus present at startup time
(and use smp_num_cpus instead of NR_CPUS)
- which means:
	1) no recompilation when you upgrade your (already smp) box
	2) no chance for cpu hotplugging
or the other choice, as it seems to be vafoured right now:
let the user pick, and blame the user if he/she did something wrong. 
and a question: is current_thread_info()->cpu a logical cpu#, or 
	a harwired one.
if it's a logical one, the easiest solution for not crashing the
kernel (on bootup - not talking about adding a cpu during runtime),
would be to restrict mac_cpus to NR_CPUS.
if it's a harwired one, well, the user has to live with the consequences
of a compilation time error.
