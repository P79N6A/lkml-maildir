I suggest you to have a glimpse at the LIDS project
(Linux Intrusion Detection System).
Its aim is to have an incorruptible kernel (no /dev/kmem, no modules after
boot time) and then to protect user space entities (like daemons, files,
append only files (for logs...), MBR, and more...)
Actually, I just remember a mirror address :
http://www.lids.webmotion.net
I released an unofficial version last night (which I hope will be soon
official) which can be found at 
ftp://ftp.webmotion.net/pub/lids
regard,
Phil
