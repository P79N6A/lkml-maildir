Subject: Kernel 2.6.15 crashes X Server after running OpenGL programs

Hi, I found this address in oops-tracing.txt and don't know where to send
this bug report otherwise.
Here is what I did:
 - on my Intel Pentium 4 CPU 2.60GHz CPU I upgraded to kernel 2.6.15 (from
   kernel.org, compiled with Debian's make-kpkg), .config attached
 - I own an ATI Radeon 9000 card and am using the closed source driver
   fglrx 8.20.8-i386 together with XFree86 (Debian 4.3.0.dfsg.1-14sarge1)
   to be able to use OpenGL.
First everything was okay and just like with 2.6.13.4.  Then I started a
OpenGL demo program (/usr/lib/xscreensaver/sballs).  It ran nicely but when
I _closed_ it the machine just froze.
After a reboot I found "kernel BUG at mm/swap.c:215!" in the syslog.
I'll attach these syslog messages to this mail.
Now I am running 2.6.13.4 again (with the same modules and drivers)
and don't have this problem.  So it must have to do with 2.6.15, right?
Probably in combination with fglrx.  I'll report this to ATI, too.
Thanks,
 Andy.
