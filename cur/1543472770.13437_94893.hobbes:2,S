IMHO the name /dev/one would be a bad idea. Becouse this could mean an
integer one which is 00000001 for 8-bit, 0000000000000001 for 16-bit, and
so on.
I don't know a better name - but IMHO /dev/one would be a bad name.
BTW: I think a good crypto filesystem is allways better than secure
deletion, becouse with a crypto filesystem (i.e. crypto-loopback) you
don't need to 'destroy' the data to make it useless for someone else.
