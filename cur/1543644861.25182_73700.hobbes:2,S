I use this driver on my ancient ev56 Alpha, if you need me to do some 
testing.
Unfortunately it is fragile and known to have obscure bugs...   Compaq 
was beating up on this driver for quite a while, but I never saw 
anything but bandaids [and they fully admitted their fixes were bandaids].
There is an out-of-tree qlogic driver that is reported to be far better 
-- but not necessarily close to Linux kernel coding style.
/me wonders if people are encouraged or scared off, at this point...
