It is fine for 2.2 as well.
The flags you restore are ok. It restores the interrupt state to the state it
was in when you were called. Think of save_flags/restore_flags as bracketing
regions of code (and being nestable in pairs). The only real bizarre rule is
that you cannot save_flags in one function and restore_flags in another without
upsetting DaveM - as it breaks on the sparc if you do that
