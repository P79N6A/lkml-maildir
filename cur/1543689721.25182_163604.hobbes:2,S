Hi,
Here are some USB bugfixes against 2.4.23-pre3.  They include a
copy_*_user audit of the usb tree, and a usb-serial fix that solves an
oops for a lot of people.  There is also some pl2303 driver fixes based
on changes that are in the 2.6 tree.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/marcelo-2.4
The individual patches will be sent in follow up messages to this email
to you and the linux-usb-devel mailing list.
thanks,
greg k-h
