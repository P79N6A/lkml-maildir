Yes, I realize it would be impossible to keep all of them documented,
but 
I would think that at least the basic ioctl's (say for changing baud on
a serial port) would be fairly static and those the documentation would

I wouldn't be trying to have a completely inclusive set, just something
that would at least contain a bunch of them so at least most programmers
