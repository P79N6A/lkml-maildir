Where or when are L2(ethernet) src/dst addresses changed during
forwarding or local-out?
In linux kernel about network, Which functions and forwarding phases
are
related above?
forwarding phase : 
1. 
packet --> NF_IP6_PRE_ROUTE --> decision of forwarding or local in
--> (if forwarding) NF_IP6_FORWARD --> NF_IP6POST_ROUTING
2. 
packet --> NF_IP6_LOCAL_OUT --> routing --> NF_IP6_POST_ROUTING
Thank you!!
