Although the PageLRU is stable as we have the zone->lru_lock we cannot
take the page off the LRU unless we can take a reference to it
preventing it from being released.  The page release code relies on the
the caller who takes the reference count to zero having exclusive access
to the page to release it.  To prevent a race with
put_page/__page_cache_release we cannot touch the page once its count
drops to zero, which occurs before the PageLRU is cleared.  PageLRU
being sampled outside the zone->lru_lock in that path to avoid taking
the lock if not required.

This is used later in the function for comparison against all of the
other pages in the 'order' sized area rooted about the target page.  Its
mearly an optimisation.
