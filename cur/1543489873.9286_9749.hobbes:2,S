No. You add a counter to /proc/net/netstat. For faster accessing (reading
/proc is slow) you could also add a special getsockopt to af packet, or if
you want to get fancy a new ancillary message type that passes socket 
statistics. Note that only intrumenting af_packet is not enough, you have 
to cover all the OOM cases in net/core/dev.c as well.
