My apologies.  I do have a small test program and intended to clean it up
to send to Robin, but got sidetracked (it's fugly at the moment).  I'll see
about getting it a bit more presentable.

The basic rule for pte sharing is that some portion of a memory region must
span an entire pte page.  For i386 and x96_64 that would be 2 meg.  The
region must either be read-only or marked to be shared if it is writeable.
The code does opportunistically look for any pte page that is fully within
a shareable vma, and will share if it finds one.
Oh, and one more caveat.  The region must be mapped to the same address in
each process.

Most system software, including the shared libraries, don't have any
regions that are big enough for sharing (the text section for libc, for
example, is about 1.5 meg).
