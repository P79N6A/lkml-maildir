It's not really "I/O port resource allocation" though - the resources
have already been allocated and potentially programmed into the BARs
well before the driver gets anywhere near the device.

Are you implying that somehow resources are allocated at pci_enable_device
time?  If so, shouldn't we be thinking of moving completely to that model
rather than having yet-another-pci-setup-model.
Let's see - we have the i386 method, the drivers/pci/setup-* method, and
it sounds like some pci_enable_device() method now.
The problem is that the "no_ioport" method is completely useless for the
drivers/pci/setup-* method since that information from the drivers comes
well after the PCI setup code has been run.

What I'm saying is that we need to unify this stuff, rather than keep
bluring and overloading the interfaces.  Otherwise we'll end up with
drivers developed on one platform which have one expectation from the
PCI API, which could potentially be different from drivers developed
on some other platform.
Let's have some uniformity - and a solution which can fit everyone -
that's all I'm asking.
