Err, thanks.  I read some old SCSI drivers and felt inspired...

    Hmm, looks like not in 3.0.4, is in 3.1.1.  I'll make it appropriately  
#ifdef'ed (which as a bonus will make things that little bit uglier still...)
    If we can stomach it the effect is nice, but the version which simply 
allows pointer correctness (rather than trying to do unsigned long too) is 
less bletcherous.
Thanks,
Rusty.
