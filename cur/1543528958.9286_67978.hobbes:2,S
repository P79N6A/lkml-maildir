Look at Tim Coleman's latest patch.  It appears to address mentioned
issues, and looks good to me for the 4-5 drivers I manually checked
against his patch.
As long as CONFIG_PCI testing is done at the individual driver level,
after that individual driver has been checked to make sure it is 100%
PCI, that seems the correct way to go.
(as I mentioned in private mail to Andre)  Note that pci.h needs to be
fixed in 2.3.current so that it correctly and fully handles the
!CONFIG_PCI case.  Ideally pci.h should define inline no-op functions
when !CONFIG_PCI, so that drivers need not test CONFIG_PCI at all
themselves.
