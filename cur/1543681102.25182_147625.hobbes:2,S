Hey there,
apart from the issues I described in my other email ("[2.5.x] doesn't
boot at all on one computer"), I've got one other issue on another
computer. While booting, I'm getting multiple panics "bad: scheduling
while atomic!". This seems to happen while the mouse/keyboard are
initializing (I've got them compiled in-kernel), and also when my root
fs (ext3) is being loaded. I've tried both with and without an initrd
image (I first thought it was caused by the initrd image), and they both
crash. The exact lines look like this:
bad: scheduling while atomic!
Call Trace:
  [0xaddress] default_idle+0x0/0x40
  [0xaddress] schedule+0x3c4/0x3d0
  [0xaddress] default_idle+0x0/0x40
  [0xaddress] default_idle+0x0/0x40
  [0xaddress] default_idle+0x0/0x40
  [0xaddress] cpu_idle+0x41/0x50
  [0xaddress] rest_init+0x0/0x60
  [0xaddress] start_kernel+0x172/0x1a0
  [0xaddress] unknown_bootoption+0x0/0x20
Is anyone else experiencing issues with 2.5.75 that look alike? Are
there specific things I should/shouldn't do to get this to work?
OS:
RedHat-9.0
gcc-3.2.2-5
module-init-tools-0.9.12
kernel 2.5.75 (and now running 2.4.21)
System:
Toshiba Satellite Pro 6000
P-3 1,06 GHz
256 MB RAM
ALi/CyberAlladin mainboard chipset
Relevant lines from grub.conf:
title Red Hat Linux (2.5.75)
        root (hd0,0)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.5.75 ro root=LABEL=/ vga=792
        initrd /initrd-2.5.75.img
Tried both with and without the initrd thing (obviously), and I also
tried using root=/dev/hda5 and omitting the vga=792 option (because the
call trace said "unknown_bootoption"), and it all didn't help.

If you need any more info, just ask. Oh, and please [CC] me, I'm not

Thanks,
