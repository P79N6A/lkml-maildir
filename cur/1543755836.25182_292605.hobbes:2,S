I am trying to figure out which tests to use right now.

These things are helped because zapping memory is very fast. Continual
turning things over results in zapping of large memory areas once in
awhile which even speeds up (a sparsely accessing) benchmark. Read my
earlier posts on the subject.
There is of course an issue if the system is continuously low on memory.
In that case the buddy allocator may not generate large enough orders of
free pages to make it worth to zap them.
