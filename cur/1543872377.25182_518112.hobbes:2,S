Sure. But I apparently was the only guy to react to the f_light horror story.
And it seems a solution was found, after some mail exchanges.
In French we have this expression : "Precher le faux pour savoir le vrai"
You could translate to "make false statements in order to discover the truth" 
or "to tell a lie in order to get at the truth" or maybe "playing the devil's 
advocate", but really the French one is better :)
