Having an invoke_debugger() function is not a bad idea; perhaps something like
this would do:
		vsnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), fmt, args);
		va_end(args);
		printk(KERN_EMERG "Kernel panic - not syncing: %s\n",buf);
	+	invoke_debugger(SIGKILL);
		bust_spinlocks(0);
	 #ifdef CONFIG_SMP
What's the best way to add an invoke_debugger() function without having to
change every arch? #ifdef/#endif in kernel/panic.c maybe...

Why? If you've got a debugger attached, it'd seem reasonable to want it to
jump into the debugger in these circumstances; after all, your system is
probably stuffed after this point.
Perhaps I should make it do:
			page->mapping, page_mapcount(page), page_count(page));
		printk(KERN_EMERG "Backtrace:\n");
		dump_stack();
	+	invoke_debugger(SIGABRT);
Which the arch can then use or ignore as it wills; and the if the arch passes
it on to the debugger, the debugger can use or ignore as it wills.
