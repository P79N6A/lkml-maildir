	I believe that there are motherboards that use a chipset from
Compaq that allows hot plugging and unplugging of ordinary PCI cards,
supported by drivers in linux-2.5.43/drivers/hotplug/cpq*.[ch].  At a
trade show, I saw a demo of a motherboard with such a capability (not
running Linux, but I think from Compaq).
	So, I believe that all ordinary PCI cards (as opposed to
devices soldered onto motherboards, for example) are now hot plug
capable, although their Linux drivers may not yet be.
	Do I misunderstand the situation?
	As a side note, I also either do not agree or somehow
misunderstand Jeff Garzik's opposition to devexit_p in non-hotplug
drivers, but that issue will irrelevant in the case of de2104.c if it
is indeed possible for all ordinary PCI form factor cards to be
deployed with the hot plug motherboard chipset that I described.
