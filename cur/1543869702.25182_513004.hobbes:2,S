What else does it say if you run with "-v"

No.  You can use the uuid in the md metadata.  Don't mention devices
in mdadm.conf at all.  Just
  ARRAY /dev/md1 UUID=xxxxx:xxxxx:Xxxxxx:xxxxx
and it should find the right devices and assemble them without
problems.

The only supported way to assemble arrays when md is a module is to
use mdadm.  Mdadm has several ways to identify an array.  Check the
man page.

Suggestions for specific improvements to the md and mdadm documentation
are always welcome.  Read mdadm.8 again and then tell me what you
wanted it to tell you that wasn't clear.
