Wrong. All addresses accessed by the CPU(s) are virtual. All addresses
accessed by other devices, including DMA-masters are bus addresses, i.e.,
what a logic analyzer would see. In some architectures, the bus address is
the physical address but in others there is a separate address-space
for devices.

Wrong. 'buf' is stored somewhere on the stack. That stack and its
data can be anywhere in physical memory. It is possible to find
it by searching through page-tables, but what you find will be
the bus address. Since the CPU deals only with virtual addresses,
i.e., translated addresses, that information is not normally useful.
Each user making a system call has a different stack that is
allocated for the purpose of making that system call. The user
can't make the system call on the user's stack because the user
could trash that and bring down the system.
