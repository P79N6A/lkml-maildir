Can you check which .config option causes it (a special type of 
bisecting...)?
This looks likely based on your findings:
-CONFIG_X86_ALIGNMENT_16=y
+CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
 CONFIG_X86_INTEL_USERCOPY=y
+CONFIG_X86_USE_PPRO_CHECKSUM=y
+CONFIG_X86_TSC=y
I expect it's not directly related to i586 vs i686.
