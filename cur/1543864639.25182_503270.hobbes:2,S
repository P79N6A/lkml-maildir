I've seen some issues with forcedeth too, but only with 2.6.20-rc5
and -rc6 as far as I can say.  The box stopped receiving packets, but a
"ifconfig eth0 promisc" 'fixed' it.
It happened rarely and I haven't been really able to reproduce it on
demand so far.
Looking through my syslog I think

sounds suspicios.

This is on an ASUS M2N-SLI Deluxe.
Right now, it again only works with eth0 promisc, but interrupts I
can at least see interrupts for all three registered eth0 msi
interrupt handlers:
|279:   13239534   PCI-MSI-edge      eth0
|280:    2515250   PCI-MSI-edge      eth0
|281:    6268650   PCI-MSI-edge      eth0
and "sleep 1" later:
|279:   13239635   PCI-MSI-edge      eth0
|280:    2515259   PCI-MSI-edge      eth0
|281:    6268661   PCI-MSI-edge      eth0
