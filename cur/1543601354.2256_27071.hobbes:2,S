I had the same problem a while ago. I haven't really looked into the
usb code, but it appears USB devices are detected from a kernel
thread, i.e., asynchronously. When the USB thread has discovered the
device, the dhcp/bootp code has already failed.
The following patch adds the "ip=wait" option. It makes ipconfig.c
retry forever until is has found a suitable device to do
dhcp/bootp/rarp.
This is untested! (I don't have a USB netdevice at home). But at least
it boots ok with a PCI network card (and waits forever if I remove
support for that card from the kernel).
Of course, in the long run, a better solution is an initrd with
dhcp/bootp/rarp client in userspace. But AFAIK there is no Debian
package that does that yet ;-).
