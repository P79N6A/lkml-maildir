I was backporting the new version to 2.2 and I noticed that by using
NR_OPEN an luser will actually be able to lock into RAM something of the
order of the dozen mbytes per process. So I'm wondering that it would be
saner to use the rlimit instead, after all I don't see much of a value
to use NR_OPEN instead of the rlimit (even if strictly speaking SuS asks
us to use NR_OPEN). Any weird program (if any) that would depend on
NR_OPEN instead of the rlimit can be easily fixed with a one liner at
most. So I guess I'd be more happy with the rlimit instead of NR_OPEN.
