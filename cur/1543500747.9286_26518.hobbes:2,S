As I think someone already mentioned, BSD has chflags(), which takes a
pathname.

funlink makes no sense, unless the fd it takes is the fd of a directory
and you pass in the name of the entry to be removed - which I imagine
is not what most people will think when they think of an fd-based
variant of unlink.  unlink() operates on names, not files, after all.
I've often wanted open-with-no-access in conjunction with fchdir().
This is because you need only execute access to set your cwd to a
directory, but there's no way to get an fd on a mode-111 directory.

freadlink() implies that open() with O_NULL has the peculiar property
that, unlike all other open()s, it doesn't follow terminal symlinks.
While I think there are ways symlinks could be improved, I don't think
this is one of them.  I can't see any use for opening a symlink except
use of write() to atomically make the link point somewhere different,
and I'd prefer to do that by making symlink() do that when the link
already exists and some appropriate condition is met.

The security weenie in me is _really_ unsure that the ability to
increase the access modes on an open fd is a good idea.

At least one news system does this now, I think - instead of keeping
each post in a separate file, it uses one huge file and does its own
space allocation out of it.

See NetBSD (and presumably other BSD) "mount -o update,rdonly" and/or
"umount -f".  (Last I tried, the latter didn't work as it should, but
that's a matter of fixing bugs rather than introducing new features.)

I did this once, long long ago, under (I think) 4.3.  I found that I
couldn't just dump core, though I forget why.  As for the open file
descriptor question, I punted - I made the relevant call fail unless
the process had no fds open.

Reasonable as this sounds, I think the last thing we need is yet
another ground on which one free-unix can be doing the "nana nana boo
boo" taunt at another.  Once upon a time I would have hoped the people
involved were sufficiently mature to avoid doing that, or responding
when on the receiving end of it - and many of them *are*, but I've been
involved in this scene too long to retain any real hope that *all* of
them are.
[And replying to another message...]

Perhaps, but it's still something that the underlying filesystem has to
support.  Just because the API bit definitions happen to match what FFS
filesystems save on disk doesn't mean it's inherently an FFS thing.

I really don't like that.  The reasons why are (1) this means you have
to have an fd free to do them; (2) it triples the number of user/kernel
crossings involved.

If done, I think the name should be changed.  They are ?etSOCKopt,
after all.  I'm not fond of this, though; it amounts to returning to
using ioctl() for the tasks - albeit with a slightly different name.
