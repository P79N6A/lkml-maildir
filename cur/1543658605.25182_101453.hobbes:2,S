	Hi Jeff,
	Now that I can again test IrDA on 2.5.X, this is time to send
you my next set of IrDA patches. I've picked the most important one in
my queue, the rest will come later. Those one have been on my web page
for more than 2 months, tested on 2.5.54 and are fairly important.
	Would you mind passing that to Linus ?
	Regards,
	Jean
P.S. : Happy new year...
P.S.2 : 16bit Pcmcia still doesn't seem to be happy on 2.5.54
