Oh my. While there will be cases where the label of the file
will match the label of the containing directory, and in fact
for most label based LSMs that will usually be the case, you
certainly can't count on it. The only place that you can find
the correct label for a file with any confidence in from the
xattr (assuming the LSM uses xattrs) on the file itself. I can
imaging an LSM for which it would make sense to derive the
label from the root directory, but I know Smack isn't one of
them, and I don't think that SELinux is either, although I
would defer a definitive answer on that to Stephen.
