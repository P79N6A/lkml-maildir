I have no idea where that firmware comes from. Since QLogic has in
fact re-released some of their firmware images under the GPL I have no
reason to believe images without copyright messages are in violation
of the BSD license.
If you have evidence that the isp driver ships with firmware thats in
violation of the GPL, then please remove it as well.

So you are suggesting that we keep violating the GPL in order to help
out people nuking their own flash by mistake?
The much cleaner way to solve this problem is to write a user space
tool to upgrade the image in the flash ram on the QL with your latest
favorite image found at www.qlogic.com. It's a 128KB image, you can
write directly to the flash in two banks by setting the read/write bit
and setting the 2nd bank bit for the last 64KB.
