The sysctl hook simply provides a way for a security module to
implement a security check for access to sysctl variables.  It provides
a classic kernel object (ctl_table) x operation interface, with the
subject implicitly passed via current, just like permission() for
inodes.  A security module can leave the hook unimplemented (no
restrictions beyond DAC), or implement a purely process-based
restriction or implement fine-grained controls to individual sysctls.
Sysctls are already exposed to userspace via sysctl(2) and/or
/proc/sys, so I'm not sure what the concern is there.  Nothing
complicated here.
As to your argument about LSM's flexibility, LSM simply followed the
guidance on what would be accepted into 2.5.  The original
SELinux/Flask architecture was more tightly integrated and had
well-defined boundaries while still providing substantial flexibility,
but the response to the SELinux presentation was to move towards
something more like LSM.  Seems pointless to argue about it now, except
as suggestions for future directions for LSM in 2.7.

Sorry, I don't see why this is preferable to implementing a single
security hook in ctl_perm that is invoked for both sysctl(2) and
/proc/sys access, providing a consistent access control regardless of
the interface.  Your approach is more prone to vulnerability (failing to
disable the sysctl(2) interface), and breaking application compatibility.
