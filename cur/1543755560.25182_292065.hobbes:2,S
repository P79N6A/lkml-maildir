Hi David,
I suppose you are talking about DMA engines which are not being driven 
by any driver ?
Sounds very interesting idea to me. Guess it depends on whether the cost of 
DMA write for memory zeroing, which is memory architecture/DMA engine dependant, 
offsets the cost of CPU zeroing.
Do you have any thoughts on that?
I wonder if such thing (using unrelated devices DMA engine's for zeroing) ever been
done on other OS'es?
AFAIK SGI's BTE is special purpose hardware for memory zeroing.
BTW, Andrew noted on lkml sometime ago that disabling caches before doing 
zeroing could enhance overall system performance by decreasing cache thrashing.
What are the conclusions about that?
