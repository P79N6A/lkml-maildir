If you can telnet it, simply use this :
# echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
# echo b >/proc/sysrq-trigger
It's dirty and you'll have an fsck. But it will nearly always work.
I use it a lot in local on distros on which the shutdown process is
as long as the boot process (you know, the ones which display lots
of 'OK' or wait indefinitely for some dead services to stop, when
you really want them to reboot quickly).
Cheers,
Willy
