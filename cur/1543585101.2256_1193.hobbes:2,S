panic doesn't sync if called from interrupt (thanks $DEITY).
It is pointless to sync during boot.
sync from driver panic is not better than one from fs.
What does it leave? I hadn't checked each panic(), but it seems that
if we ever want syncing upon panic() it's safer to do sys_sync() by
hands before calling panic(). If it is actually ever needed, that is.
