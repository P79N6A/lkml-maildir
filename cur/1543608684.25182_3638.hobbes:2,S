Subject: 2.4.14: Unresolved Symbols in loop.o
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I configured 2.4.14 and then did a:
make dep clean bzImage modules modules_install
The last two lines of output were:
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in 
/lib/modules/2.4.14/kernel/drivers/block/loop.o
depmod: 	deactivate_page
I rebooted with the new kernel and tried mounting an iso. It told me I 
didn't have loopback support. I tried a "modprobe loop" and got a 
unresolved symbol error for "deactivate_page".
