well I've never seen any OOPS on this machine before or segv on this
machine and I use it for cross-compiling glibc/gdb/binutils/gcc/kernels
etc for the VAX port of Linux so I'm sure I'd have seen one before if it
was memory... I can run memtest on it at some stage over the next couple
of days but I'm pretty confident the RAM is okay.. granted its not ECC...
I have nothing unusual in my config I don't think,
ext2, nfsd, vfat, sb16, parport, ne2k-pci (x2 cards)...I can post my
.config later on today when I get back home..
Dave.
