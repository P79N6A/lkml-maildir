But then there's the counter-argument: If the patch does cause any odd 
issues to shake loose, learning about them in advance by exposing the 
patch in the -mm tree would be worthwhile.

P.S.: I did test the patch by running the g_serial gadget with
usbserial loaded on the host.  Disconnecting the gadget while a user
process held the /dev/ttyUSB0 file open didn't cause any problems.
