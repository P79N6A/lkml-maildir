"It's a feature to add crap to drivers and subsystems that don't care!"
That's a novel thing.
Maybe we could add other features too. Like a "IM_NOT_AN_IDIOT" flag that 
every driver has to set in it's "struct device", so that the device 
manager knows that it wasn't written by an idiot.

Right. That's what the IM_NOT_AN_IDIOT thing will do too - it will 
guarantee that only smart people do the right thing.
Great idea. We'll get a better kernel in no tim!
