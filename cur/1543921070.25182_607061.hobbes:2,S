Sigh, well this turned out less informative than I'd liked.
After bisecting 2.6.23 to 2.6.23-mm1, I found that
git-s390.patch is the one breaking my s390 boot :(
(Frown bc it's a conglomeration of patches0
Symptom is:
	"Cannot open root device "dasdd2" or unknown-block(94,14)"
even though dasdd2 appeared to be found earlier in the boot.  I also
get
Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available partitions:
...
5e0c 7211520 dasdd driver: dasd-eckd
...
5e0e 6949296 dasdd2
Will keep looking at it, but maybe the fix is obvious to someone
in this cc: list?
thanks,
-serge
