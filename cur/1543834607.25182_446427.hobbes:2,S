1) no luck with remote serial console
2) netconsole does not work although connecting to the listener with netcat and
 sending strings works
I'm gonna try via physical rs232 9pins and see how that works.
afterwards I will try to bisect the revisions you mentioned.
btw, the issue seems to come and go as I managed to boot log into a .17-git6
kernel or is timing-dependent.
