Usually there is one per final link, so one in vmlinux and one in each .ko.
There is nothing you can figure out from the bitstring except to match it
with known binaries.

It's just one hash.  (Each .ko has one too, but I didn't bother with the
/sys/module/name/notes hack because it was too much trouble.)

I do kernel debugging all the time, but I am not usually root.  It's not
that I can't be root any time, of course--I'm usually using a machine where
I can sudo with no password.  But when I was young they taught me not to be
root whenever you don't have to, because I know I'm bound to break
something with a slip of the finger even when I surely ought to know
better.  So I don't run analysis tools as root, just use sudo when I need
to actually change something, or fetch a protected log to look at.

If distros are prepared for the notion of chmod's in /sys, that sounds
fine.  I presume you would want to uniformly change most of /sys, where
many things in /sys/module and /sys/kernel can be pretty revealing.  Like I
said, I have no special opinions about the permissions.  On all the systems
I use myself, everyone has ready access to the complete source and binaries
anyway (and can run dmesg).
Thanks,
Roland
