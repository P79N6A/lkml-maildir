Uh, just the pid would do.  Maybe reserve a bit to indicate contention,
but surly one word would be enough.

At that point you are most likely down for the count.  The most use for
this would be development where programs are dying like flies.  If the
sem area is "registered" with the kernel, it could do the right thing®
in the exit code.  Except for using the cmpxchg I don't think it adds to
the overhead.

Well, none, but you don't in either case.  This is a non-argument.

That is your privilege :-)
