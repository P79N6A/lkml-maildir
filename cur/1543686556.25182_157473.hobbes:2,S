That's cool, I am not affected.
Simply the documentation you mentioned, I felt someone who writes code
using CLONE_THREAD in future should be aware that if they just use
CLONE_THREAD by itself, their code won't work as expected with the
later 2.5 kernels.  The EINVAL ensures that perfectly.  So, :)
