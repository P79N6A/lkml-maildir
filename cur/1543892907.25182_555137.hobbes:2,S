Yeah, but a /really/ old version -- 4.2.11 is from May 2005 :/ .  I feel 
I should point out that that version IS using udev, but just like 
mkinitrd and nash, the udev there is probably just as old.  At the same 
time, that does make it an excellent test case for this sort of situation.
Andrew, is there any chance you can put that initrd.img somewhere that I 
can download it?  That'd really help me to figure out what's going on, 
as the minutia of our initrds from 2005 have faded a bit in my memory.
