That's not a hole

It should not do ioremap uncacheable from reserved because there
shouldn't be a MMIO hole in there. It can do ioremap_cachable()
but that is ok.

If it's rare enough mapping in 2MB chunks around the holes is ok.

It relies partly on the MTRRs and partly checks for >= end_pfn.
Yes it's a gross hack, but it works.

The older X servers for once or x86emu in user space and likely various 
others. There are all kind of scary utilities using /dev/mem around
(like BIOS flash updaters etc.) 
I know some people who don't trust the VM for large memory ares 
like to boot with small mem=...  and then grab memory through /dev/mem.
I suspect if that didn't work anymore there would be eventually
complaints too although there might be a case be made for not 
supporting that anymore.
BUt really /dev/mem is widely used and full compatibility is fairly
important.

The basic idea is fine.
