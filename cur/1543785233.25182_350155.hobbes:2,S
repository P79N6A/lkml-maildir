Your test program does seems to imply that gcc wants the alignment before
the return address (ie it prints out an address that is 4 bytes offset),
but on the other hand I'm not even sure how careful gcc is about this
alignment thing at all.
In the "main()" function, gcc will actually generate a "andl $-16,%esp" to 
force the alignment, but ot in the handler function. Just a gcc special 
case? Random luck?
Andi - you know the gcc people, is there some documented rules somewhere? 
How does gcc itself try to align the stack when it generates the calls?
