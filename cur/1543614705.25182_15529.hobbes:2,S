Yes, i've called gericom, and there are willing to do that. But i am not 
shure, that the problem is only on gericom site. With kernel 2.4.16 and all 
acpi patches applied the kernel doesn't create the /proc/acpi directory, but 
the cpu-fan keeps running when the kernel is booted. PCMCIA ist working 
without problems. With kernel 2.4.17 /proc/acpi is created, but the fan stops 
during kernel boot and will never be powered on again. That can damage the 
hardware. 
So why does the kernel power off the fan? If there is a userspace deamon 
needed to power on the fan, it is not possible to run the machine in level 1, 
or a longer installation like suse will never be possible;-) 
Even to track the problems is hard to do: You have only about 5 minutes time 
after boot....
