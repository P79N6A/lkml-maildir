ok. In what way did you enable LTTng instrumentation? I have 0.5.108 
installed, and i'd like to make sure i do everything as you did, to make 
the tests comparable. Which kernel config options (default ones?), and 
what precise lttcl commands did you use, were they the usual:
  lttctl -n trace -d -l /mnt/debugfs/ltt -t /tmp/trace
? What filesystem does /tmp/trace reside on?
