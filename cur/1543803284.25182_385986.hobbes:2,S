I'm not saying it's the right answer, but it's one of two workarounds 
currently available.
idle=poll causes increased power useage
timer source change (mentioned earlier in this thread) limits timer 
precision
neither of these are fixes, but by understanding the different costs 
people can choose the work around they want to use while waiting for a 
better fix.
