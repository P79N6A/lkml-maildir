   Already canonized.

   (1) pci.txt never mentioned you _need_ to call pci_set_master(), you can
do the same thing itself if you want, it's only a helper routine in order
to simplify most drivers.
   (2) pci_set_master() exists in both 2.2 and 2.3 and it works in the
same way.

   You should use them for PCI regions as well.
				Have a nice fortnight
