I don't know how I managed to miss this before, but I think it's
definitely a step in the right direction. I do wonder, though, if we're
going about this whole thing in a peacemeal approach. I feel like the
whole issue of power state management on the system wide and driver
level are being treated as two separate issues. Is it just me?
