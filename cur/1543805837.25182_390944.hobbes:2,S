You should not add yet another program that does video card accesses
from userspace.  The xorg and fbdev developpers are having a hard
enough time already making sure both sides have a consistent view of
the video card state, and it looks like they're on the way to unifying
as much as they can in the kernel under drm just because of these
difficulties.  Do not add to them by frobbing the card in
unpredictable ways from userspace, please.
