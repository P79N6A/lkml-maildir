So we need to get this reviewed.
Christoph and I are pretty much the only people who do filesystem
reviewing, despite the fact that we have hoards of filesystem developers
out there busily doing their own stuff (and that includes the unionfs
developers, I might add).
Our review-to-development ratio is wildly out of whack and I don't know how
to fix that.
Meanwhile, from a quick scan I'd say that unionfs is much, much too lightly
commented for a review to be particularly effective.   Please work on that.
