 thanks.

Hm, not as stable a bug as I'd thought.  I have performed a number of
bisections with different start points and they have not converged on
the same patch twice.  Even bisections with the _same_ start point
didn't always converge on the same patch.
What ever the problem is it isn't immediately apparent in latest git so
I guess we'll just have to keep our eyes peeled.
Thanks,
