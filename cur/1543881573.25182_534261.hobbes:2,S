Some other speculations:
1. Would it be possible to add ioctl's to /dev/console? This would be more in
    keeping with older Unix style model.
2. Using sysfs makes sense if there is a device object that exists to
   add the sysfs attributes to.
3. Procfs is handy for summary type tables.
4. Netlink does feel like overkill for this. Although newer generic netlink
   makes it easier.
