We all agree on this then.
I'm just little paranoid about a real-world app (LTP/LSB don't matter)
relying on the current semantics.
But maybe there's no other way to find out, than to remove
steal_locks() and see if anybody complains.

Probably there is.  It would involve allocating a separate
lock-owner-ID stored in files_struct but separate from it.  But it's
more complicated than simply not propagating locks on exec in the
CLONE_FILES case.
