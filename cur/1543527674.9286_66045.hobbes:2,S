	Sigh,
	I was hoping it would never make to kernel, and if it did, it
	would never be enable by default. But it seems I was wrong on both
	accounts :( 
	Is there some sane (and easy) way to stop this crazed thing from
	killing my programs? if I need to kill something I can do this
	myself. I don't need to have it kill my X (it did to me previous 
	time), and other stuff (hint: it is always netscape, not the 
	processes it kills)... I have always running top , and some spare
	xterm so I can use it to kill in oom situations..
