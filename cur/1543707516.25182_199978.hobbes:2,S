It might be yes. We're trying to determine this.

We could, the down interface is but one of many. Yet, the raw socket 
becomes write-blocked because of a packet sent destined to be sent 
out a down interface, for ever.
While I appreciate the kernel's best efforts, I feel it's possibly 
counter-productive to be so persistent for raw sockets :)
To work around this behaviour, we'll have to move from one single 
global file descriptor to one file descriptor per interface. Which is 
potentially a scaling overhead for the case of thousands of 
interfaces.

How can we discard it? It's sitting queued somewhere in the socket 
layer, and we're blocked from sending from /any/ interface simply 
because of a cable pull on one interface. 
We could set a 'write blocked' timer I guess, and close() and reopen 
our raw socket if we find our raw socket write-blocked for too long, 
but that would be a gross hack.
If the socket buffer were fill, fine, write-block for that. But
surely otherwise, for a _raw socket_ which specifically makes no
reliability, the socket should not get held up because a driver is
throttling the socket due to no-link.
This isnt a TCP socket, it's a raw socket - it's up to the process 
using the raw socket to implement it's own reliability and/or flow 
control, that's the precise point. Hence, the kernel should _not_.

For a raw socket?
Surely the correct behaviour is to either return an error from
sendmsg() or else drop the packet if the driver is link-down?

We cant drop it unfortunately. How do we do this? SO_SNDTIMEO is not 
settable on linux.

We multiplex adjacencies on many interfaces via one file-descriptor.  
We're dropping adjencies on all interfaces because we sent a packet
destined to go out a link-down interface, which the kernel accepted 
_without_ returning an error[1].
1. Hasso will correct me if i'm wrong here I hope - Hasso, no error 
is reported from ospf_write() from sendmsg() is there?
