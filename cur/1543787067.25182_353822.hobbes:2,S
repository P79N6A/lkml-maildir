Actually, I made a proposal back in 1999 which I think would let many
userspace apps deal with PID reuse nicely.
The idea is to introduce a kernel call (it can be a prctl(2) setting,
although my pseudo-code "defines" an entire syscall for simplicity)
which would "lock" the invoking process' view of a given PID (while
letting the PID get reused - so there's no added risk of DoS).  The
original posting and subsequent thread can be seen here:
http://lists.nas.nasa.gov/archives/ext/linux-security-audit/1999/08/msg00108.html
The proposal itself (unedited since 1999, but the idea holds) is as
follows:
in task_struct:
	int locked_pid;
int sys_lockpid(int pid)
{
	int old;
	old = current->locked_pid;
	current->locked_pid = pid;
	return old;
}
on kill(2) and ptrace(2):
	if (pid > 0 && -pid == current->locked_pid)
		return -ESRCH;
on execve(2):
	current->locked_pid = 0;
on fork(2), in get_pid(), where last_pid is the PID being allocated:
	for_each_task (p)
		if (p->locked_pid == last_pid) p->locked_pid = -lastpid;
in applications, such as killall(1):
	do {
		lockpid(target);
		if (!need_to_kill(target)) break;
		if (kill(target, SIGKILL) == 0) break;
	} while (errno == ESRCH);
	lockpid(0);
Performance can be improved by maintaining a global locked_pid_count,
so that fork(2) could skip the loop if count is zero.  Implementing
this would require an extra spinlock (the pseudo-code above will need
some anyway, if actually implemented).
It is possible to clear locked_pid in kill(2) and ptrace(2), but I'm
not sure whether that's a good idea, as we could have these syscalls
in signal handlers that are not aware of the new feature.
