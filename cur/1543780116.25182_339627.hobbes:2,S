That's correct.  de_thread will turn the thread calling exec into the new
leader and kill off all the other threads, including the old leader.  The
exec'ing thread's existing task_struct is reassigned to the PID of the
original leader.

That is correct.

You are mistaken.  The signal code handles process signals sent when the
leader is a zombie.  The group leader sticks around with the PID that
matches the TGID, until there are no live threads with its TGID.  That is
how process-wide kill can still work.
Thanks,
