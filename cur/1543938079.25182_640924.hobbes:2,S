This is the most recent mos7720.c from 
 /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
But it is compiled against my 2.6.22.13-0.3 kernel if thats a problem I can run this under another kernel but it did not seem as if anything had changed that would be a problem in this kernel.
 I have a few mods I have made trying to track down whats going on mostly just some extra printk's and a fix to turn off the interrupt urb upon closing the device.
