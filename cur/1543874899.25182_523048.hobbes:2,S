Subject: [ PATCH 1/7 ] UML - Update UML definition of ARRAY_SIZE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/22/209

This is the minimal change needed to keep UML building with the new
definition of ARRAY_SIZE.  It is defined in user_util.h so that
userspace files, which can't include kernel.h, can still use
ARRAY_SIZE.  However, since user_util.h is included everywhere,
including kernel files, the token sequence of the expansion has to
match.
This patch copies enough from the kernel headers to make that happen.
However, this is too gross to survive, and so is the entire header.
Future patches will make this header disappear, but this is a quick
and simple fix for the problem in case there is a noticable lag
between this patch and the more extensive patches which tidy this mess.
