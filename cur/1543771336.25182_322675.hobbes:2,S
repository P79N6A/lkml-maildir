For ourselves we implemented an clock interface for a limited subset of 
architectures that provides a fast timestamp in kernel and userspace.
Basically it has one call to return a 64-bit timestamp, and another call 
to tell you how fast the clock is ticking.
If it can, it uses things like the x86 cycle counter or the ppc 
timebase.  If there is no arch support, it falls back to clock_gettime.
