Yes, I'm quite aware of that.  
So a filter would have to be smarter than just checking the command
codes.  There would have to be a special case for the mode page
commands which filters on accessible mode pages.
Are there any other commands that would need filtering at a finer
grain than the command level?
Additionally, another thing that is really needed is to match
the different variants of hdr->dxfer_direction against the direction
of the commands, otherwise one could ask for a REQUEST_SENSE but with
a direction of SG_DXFER_TO_DEV.  This isn't a security problem in the
sense that it can destroy the drive itself, but it might hang the
IDE state machine in the kernel, motherboard or drive.

SG_IO does not have to work at the SCSI level, it can filter the
commands at a higher level.

So guess why I suggested that the kernel should contain the mechanics
to filter commands (and yes, I was aware of the mode page problems but
didn't want to make a long mail even longer), and that the list of
commands would be uploaded to the kernel from userspace.  It was at
the end of the mail you replied to...
That way an application, such as cdrecord, could keep a list of safe
commands for each device and use the appropriate list for each kind of
device.  If the device is a tape, allow access to the mode page that
can control BPI and compression settings.  If it's a cdrom, allow
access to the mode page with CDDA settings.
Of course, if it isn't possible to do this at a mode page level, maybe
the access controls would have to be at the level of individual bits
in a mode page, then it gets trickier.  It might, or might not be
feasible to implement such a filte.  I don't know which is true or
which is not, I'm just trying to look at ways of solving the problem.

Which is not all that different from suid binaries.  Instead of
trusting an application, you're trusting a user or a role.  This isn't
much different from giving "trusted" users access to /dev/scd0.

No.  Sure, you can redefine read access to a SCSI device to mean "may
only use normal read" and write access to "may use read, write and
send raw SCSI commands", but that is a rather bad fit to how
read/write normally are used.
What do you do if you want to allow users with read access to
read a SCSI tape (and to be able select the BPI)?  With your
suggestion, the user will need write access too, but I may just want
to give the user read access.

So why can't cdrecord use specialized ioctls then?

cdrecord probably wouldn't break.  Other applications that open
/dev/scd0 as readonly would break.  cdrecord isn't the only
application in the world you know.
The Linux philosophy is "do it right".  And when Linus has been
changing interfaces he has said that he prefers something to break
noisily (not compile) rather than to get compile fixes that leave the
bugs still in there.
