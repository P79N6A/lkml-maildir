Odd. I didn't think Andi's code worked well enough that we could hit
anything but the default trust the BIOS case.  I guess someone had
the right hardware to perform that miracle.

That is where I figured we were when we first hit this bug.
I have always found the ways of stable tree maintainers to be
mysterious.  Sometimes holding back code with minimal risk sometimes
insisting we cleanup things instead of reverting things.
So I have just decided to write the code and let other people figure
out when it should be merged :)  And of course when my code has
problems to address them.
