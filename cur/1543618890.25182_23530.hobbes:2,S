I like this.
Plain grep turned out hundreds of 'inline' (I didn't even count).
I'd like to write a script which will narrow it to:
.... inline .... {
   more than 2 lines
}
But my knowledge of grep/sed/perl/awk/??? magic is really not up to the task.
Plan:
* replace those with big_inline
* #define it to 'inline' or to '' (nothing) and compare kernel sizes
* make it CONFIG_xxx option if it worth the trouble
