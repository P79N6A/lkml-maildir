Could you test 2.5.59-base?  Could be that 2.5.59-mm7 is slower for some
reason.
Or it could be that the increased CPU speed now makes the load alternate
between 100% cpu-bound and 100% IO-bound rather than some combination of
both.  (If you understand what I mean by this, please explain it to me some
time).
