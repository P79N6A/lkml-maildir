You mean to list all the Unicodes that would be ever used? I can't see the
purpose...
BTW: It's very inconvenient that one can't easily check whether the
console is in UTF-8 mode. The only method I know is to output some test
characters and look how much did the cursor moved. It has disadvantages:
ugly, alters the streen contents. and, most important, requires to flush
the terminal input (to read the cursor position)! The same applies to
checking which of the four maps is active (yes, I needed this in one
tool). I would appreciate a better method - maybe some ioctl, as for
reading the actual map contents. Still don't know what about xterms etc.
- how should they tell if it's UTF-8 or that one can switch to UTF-8.

Maybe. I'm not sure which would be easier.

What to put into the Unicode buffer when someone writes into /dev/vcs*?

Yes, I was surprised that gpm did't work this way (checked today). But
with the current implementation gpm doesn't need to care about Unicode or
other modes...
Isn't sufficient to make unicoded /dev/vcs*? gpm could read this. But
AFAIK the other end is missing - now it can't paste arbitrary data into
the "keyboard".
