Well, this notion of letting tasks safely complete to any ring they can
address is just a possibility.  We might decide that it's not worth it.
 This implementation was an easy example that borrows from the way
futexes do similar work.
I like it because you could have, say, different processes completing
into a ring in shared memory.
If we do allow this kind of flexible ring specification, it's not at all
clear that trees would be the best way to address the scalability
limits.  There are lots of possibilities, including locking the page
lock of the page which holds the head index.
