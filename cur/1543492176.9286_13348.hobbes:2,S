Finally got the serial console setup to where I could see what messages
happened. And there is a smoking herring.....
Unfortunately the top half of the oops scrolls off the terminal before I
can write it down (no screen recall on this one :-{ ) but I have the
bottom half and it seems from the Aieee Killing Interrupt Handler part
that I truly have an IRQ problem. 
Actually I have the code and trace sections written down and will try to
ksymoops them later today. It seems that this problem has cropped up
somewhere in 2.1/2.2 series kernels. On the exact same hardware if I run
2.0.3[3-6] everything works just peachy. So far I have tried 2.2.[0-5] and
will try some -ac and some 2.1 later on. The 2.2.[0-5] all exhibit the
exact same crash. As soon as the second ethernet card is link state up (ip
link set eth1 up) the machine oopses. 
Here is the gory part of the oops written down from the terminal:

Aieee Killing interrupt handler
Kernel Panic: attempting to kill the idle task
In swapper task - not syncing
I will try to decode this and also try out some 2.1.xx kernels to see
where the breakage starts. If you would like further info let me know.
Thanks.
