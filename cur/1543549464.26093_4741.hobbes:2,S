This is obviously much better (getting a signal for ALL debug register
triggers is a _good_ thing), but is it safe to call force_sig_info
from the debug trap handler if it was entered from kernel mode ?
Since the debug trap handler can (potentially) be entered as a result
of _any_ store instruction in the kernel, it's certainly not clear to me
that I wouldn't be violating locking assumptions by calling
force_sig_info from here...
