This is a highly common pattern, and unfortunately you get the highly 
common Linux response:
In Linux we never ever assume a driver is working simply because the 
hardware vendor tested it.  A decade of real world experience PROVES 
precisely the opposite -- getting code out into the world early and 
often repeatedly turned up problems not seen in hardware vendor's testing.
Take a lesson from when I was on Linus's shit-list... twice:  Twice, 
Intel submitted an e1000 update after the merge window closed.  Twice, 
they claimed the driver passed their quite-exhaustive internal testing. 
  And twice, the most popular network driver broke for large masses of 
users because I took a hardware vendor's word on testing rather than 
rely on the testing PROVEN to flush out problems:  public linux kernel 
testing.
I'm not singling out Intel, there are plenty of other hardware vendors 
that repeat the exact same pattern.
It's quite simply impossible for a hardware vendor to test all the weird 
combinations in the field.  Our test lab -- the Internet -- is the one 
we trust.
