The only way I know involves prodding the decomposing corpse with a long,
pointy stick (i.e. kdb).  That probably doesn't help you, though.

Well, you can try ruling out the XFS changes - on this page:
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=history;h=9eeff2395e3cfd05c9b2e6074ff943a34b0c5c21;f=fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_aops.c
These diffs:

Are the ones that change the XFS I/O path from what is in 2.6.14.  Try
reverting them and see if the problem goes away....
Cheers,
Dave.
