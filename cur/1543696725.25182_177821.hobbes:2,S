How overly complex :-). I wrote a similar tool, dunno if it still works.
Googling shows:

To make the below work, all you probably need to do is change sgio() to
use CDROM_SEND_PACKET for instance. That'll work in 2.4 and 2.6. You
just need to fill a cdrom_generic_command and send it to the cdrom fd.
Ala
	struct cdrom_generic_command cgc;
	memset(&cgc, 0, sizeof(cgc));
	memcpy(cgc.cmd, cdb, sizeof(cdb));
	cgc.buffer = the_buffer_to_write_to;
	cgc.buflen = sizeof(the_buffer_to_write_to);
	cgc.data_direction = CGC_DATA_READ;
	cgc.quiet = 1;
	if (ioctl(cdrom_fd, CDROM_SEND_PACKET, cdrom_fd) < 0) {
		perror("CDROM_SEND_PACKET");
		return 1;
	}
	/* success */
	return 0;
