"I used it for comparison to file listings of different kernel versions,
and my conclusion is that this list is either based on 2.5.68 (released
April 20, 2003) or on 2.5.69 (released May 5, 2003). Those are the only
two versions that contain all of the listed files." -- Groklaw reader

Maybe they just did a grep for anything with the three letters SMP
(among other things).  Interesting files in the list that might support
this.
fs/reiserfs/fix_node.c
2246 : * When ported to SMP kernels, only at the last
net/ipv4/devinet.c
525- /* Note that these ioctls will not sleep,
526- so that we do not impose a lock.
527: One day we will be forced to put shlock here (I mean SMP)
528- */
net/atm/pppoatm.c
/*
* We don't really always want to do this since it's
* really inefficient - it would be much better if we could
* test if we had actually throttled the generic layer.
* Unfortunately then there would be a nasty SMP race where
* we could clear that flag just as we refuse another packet.
* For now we do the safe thing.
