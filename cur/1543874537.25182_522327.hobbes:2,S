Can you get rid of these macros?  I think they make it a wee bit harder
to read.  My brain doesn't properly parse the foo(arg)(bar) syntax.

+               return pt_op(vma, copy_vma)(dst_mm, src_mm, vma);
+       if (vma->pagetable_ops && vma->pagetable_ops->copy_vma)
+               return vma->pagetable_ops->copy_vma(dst_mm, src_mm, vma);
I guess it does lead to some longish lines.  Does it start looking
really nasty?
If you're going to have them, it might just be best to put a single
unlikely() around the macro definitions themselves to keep anybody from
having to open-code it for any of the users.
