Yes, it fixes all _3_ startup warnings and lets the machine reboot and 
power off again. 3 warnings are the 2 reported as a regression from 
2.6.24, and one present also under 2.6.24:
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
sysfs: duplicate filename 'bridge' can not be created

So, well done! I was going to disturb you with that one after 2.6.25, now 
I don't have to any more, unless we want it fixed in 2.6.24-stable.
