I have just lost _ABSOLUELY_ everything
of importance to myself. The reason? put
quite plain and simply, two groups need to
get their act together:
1). The international crypto guys
2). The above need to talk to the fsck guys
     because fsck just fscked up big time.
I run fsck to check the ext2 fs on my
encrypted partition before it gets mounted,
I don't expect fsck to provide the added
"feature" of destroying that filesystem when
it was in fact completely stable, usuable
and NOT in need of repair. I'm going
to have to see my doctor now as I am the
most depressed that I have ever been.
