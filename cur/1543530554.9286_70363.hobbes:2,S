Doing one big update instead of incremental updates creates MANY
problems.  See my other messages :)

I would LOVE to see this happen.
Donald, I, and others all seem to agree that having his drivers and
the kernel drivers diverge is a poor situation.  However, while Donald
continues closed source development with periodic code drops, and does
not work with other kernel developers when creating infrastructure, I do
not see a resolution to the situation any time soon.
