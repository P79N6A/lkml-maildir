I was waiting for the "anglo-saxon" argument.
I don't think it's a valid argument. You already have "/dev". You already
have english names for the numbers in ioctl's (and let's not be mentally
dishonest and say "numbers are cross-cultural", because NOBODY MUST EVER
USE THE RAW NUMBERS - you have to use the anglo-saxon #define'd names
because the numbers aren't even cross-platform on Linux, much less
portable to other systems).
So the "English is bad" argument is a complete non-argument.
