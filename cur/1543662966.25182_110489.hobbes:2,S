 Hello everybody! 
 I have two questions conserning the process named kacpidpc:
1)what this process is? could anyone answer me or give any reference about
it.
2)I had a trouble with this process, may be someone could explain me,
where this problem went from. The problem was:
I have a server under linux debian 2.4.17 and it happened two times, that
all my disck space finished, becouse the file pacct grew anormously, if i
tried to look lastcomm it all was filled with lines like:  
kacpidpc           F    root     ??         0.00 secs Mon Feb 17 23:32
kacpidpc           F    root     ??         0.00 secs Mon Feb 17 23:32
kacpidpc           F    root     ??         0.00 secs Mon Feb 17 23:32
kacpidpc           F    root     ??         0.00 secs Mon Feb 17 23:32
 Thanks in advance, with respect, Anton Lizunov
