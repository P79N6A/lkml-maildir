If you want to manage lifetime rules independently you might want to
not embed struct device into you subsystems objects but attach them
via pointers and use device_create(). Now that we orphan sysfs access
upon unregistering device this will severe all ties from driver core
to your system once you start teardown of a device and you should be
in clear.
However there are simpler subsystems (input, serio, etc.) where there
is only one core module which provides services to device drivers and
handles registration and deregistration. For such substustems it makes
sense to embed struct devices and manage lifetime for all components
at once.
