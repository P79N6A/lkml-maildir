Hi,
I am writing a driver for the PCI controller for the
2.4.17 kernel.
I found out that we need to define 2 macros
PCIBIOS_MIN_MEM and PCIBIOS_MIN_IO. What does these
macros mean?
I have a ARM board with Memory space starting at
0x6000_0000 and IO space starting at 0x7000_0000. So
does this mean that I have to set the above values to
these macros?
Thanks and Regards
Chandrasekhar
