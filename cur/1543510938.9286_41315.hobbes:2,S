I think the point he's making is that, regardless of whether it affects 
performance or not, it's the wrong speed figure. I freely admit to not 
knowing the first thing about the code (I lurk on linux-kernel mainly to 
keep abreast of what's new and upcoming, not because I have any C 
programming skill), but if this is a commonality to DVD drives, then why 
not just skip reporting the speed entirely. (e.g., report "hdc: ATAPI 
DVD-ROM drive, 512kB Cache"). Or, alternatively, if the speed is "0", skip 
the speed (since we know that unless your CD-ROM is broken, it's probably 
faster than zero-speed *g*)
Just $0.02 worth from the peanut gallery.
