If you missed the 2.2.0-pre6 post, here is an update. :/ I compiled
2.2.0-pre9 and epic100.o again as a module, upon booting I ran scp as a
non-root user, and proceeded to copy a very large file from one machine to
another... After 470MB the sending machine rebooted... So the problem remains,
I have not found the source, but I am looking at the cards low-power mode, and
if thats not it I guess I will need to inspect the last packet sent to the
receiving machine to see if there is ANY clue there...
can anyone else run a similar test to verify this problem. Send at least one GB
before being sure it works, as mine did not fail until after 470MB, which
didnt take all that long really...
also I should note tha the throughput nearly doubled when compiling into the
kernel, and not as a module? modules shouldnt have that great a performance
hit? Could someone familiar with _efficient_ network drivers please look over
the epic100 code as soon as possible :)
