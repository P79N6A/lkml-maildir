the network one could perhaps be related to the network deadlocks
reported by others. Would be nice to turn on RWSEM_DETECT_DEADLOCKS and
to use a serial logging if possible.
does the audio test use alot of CPU time? In that case it would be
normal for the RT task to 'lock' the system up. In any case it would be
nice to try 0.4.2 because it has more check-preemption fixes affecting
both UP and SMP systems.
