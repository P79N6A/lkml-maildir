Subject: [PATCH] SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR scheduler fix, kernel 2.2.21
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/6/21/97

The 2.2.21 kernel was behaving incorrectly for SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR 
scheduling.
The correct behaviour for SCHED_FIFO is priority preemption: run to 
completion, or system call, or preemption by higher priority process. The 
correct behaviour for SCHED_RR is the same as SCHED_FIFO for the 
preemption case, or run for a time slice, and go to the back of the run 
queue for that priority.
More details can be found at:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/realtime.html
This is a small patch, but fixes the behaviour for SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR 
scheduling in the 2.2.21 kernel. It also improves the efficiency of the 
kernel by NOT calling schedule() for every tick for a SCHED_FIFO process.
