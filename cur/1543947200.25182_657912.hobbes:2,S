Deep indentation should be fairly easy, given that you
already have rules in place that says "Tabs are 8 characters".
So if you find a line that begins with more than say 4 SP, you
can flag that as already bogus (i.e. "does not indent with HT"),
more than 8 SP definitely so.
I'll leave harder "complex expressions" to sparse experts ;-),
