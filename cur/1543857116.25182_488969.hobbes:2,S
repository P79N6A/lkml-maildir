It's just been pointed out to me that the parisc one isn't safe.
<dhowells> imagine variable X is set to 3
<dhowells> CPU A issues cmpxchg(&X, 3, 5)
<dhowells> you'd expect that to change X to 5
<dhowells> but what if CPU B assigns 6 to X between cmpxchg reading X
and it setting X?
Given parisc's paucity of atomic operations (load-and-zero-32bit and
load-and-zero-64bit), cmpxchg() is impossible to implement safely.
There has to be something we can hook to exclude another processor
modifying the variable.  I'm OK with using atomic_cmpxchg(); we have
atomic_set locked against it.
Of course, using cmpxchg() isn't really lockless.  It's just hidden
locking.
