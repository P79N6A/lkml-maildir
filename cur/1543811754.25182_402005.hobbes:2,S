Upstream _libata_ doesn't care much about suspend/resume.  Officially, 
its a work in progress with major pieces -- your patch and ACPI -- still 
missing.
Further, good improvements covering some of the changes in Hannes' patch 
are already in #upstream.
Thus, it's more work than its worth to care about the patch as-is.  It 
should be redone against #upstream, which is where all suspend/resume 
development is occurring.
