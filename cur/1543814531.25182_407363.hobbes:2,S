The U. Wisconsin group that was doing journal-guided fast RAID resync
actually ended up putting dummy transactions into the logs for this
with the block numbers even if there were no metadata changes.
That way the journal could tell the MD RAID layer what blocks might
need resyncing instead of having to scan the whole block device for
inconsistencies.
That code hasn't been merged, or even posted anywhere yet AFAICS, though
I'd be very interested in seeing it.  It changes MD RAID recovery time
from O(device size) to O(journal size), and that is a huge deal when you
have an 8TB filesystem.
As for the ctime update, I'm not sure what happened to that, though
ext3 would currently only update the inode at most once a second.
Cheers, Andreas
