I upgraded to e2fsprog-1.23 and LInux 2.4.8 yesterday and saw this:
Aug 16 08:58:20 yeti kernel: md: fsck.ext3(pid 207) used obsolete MD ioctl,
upgrade your software to use new ictls.
Do you suppose we could change the printk line to actually output the ioctl
that was requested?
i.e.:
/usr/src/linux/drivers/md/md.c
                default:
                        printk(KERN_WARNING "md: %s(pid %d) used obsolete MD
ioctl(%d), upgrade your software to use new ictls.\n", current->comm,
current->pid, cmd);
Might help debugging this stuff a little easier.
