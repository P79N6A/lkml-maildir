Subject: my email never makes it to this list?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

hello,
I tried to send an email to this list yesterday, but it didn't show up.
So I resent it today, and it didn't show up either, allthough my
other mails to the list appear on www.lkml.org/archive.
is there a kind of filter, which rejects particular subjets?
e.g., writing h e l p (without the blanks) in the Subject or body?
for safety reasons , I will not include the email here. I wonder
if *this* email makes it to the list?
herp
