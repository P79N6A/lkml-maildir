These two calls were exactly the reasons to make the shm fs for
linux. It makes posix shm possible which provides shm_open an
shm_unlink. This together with mmap and frtuncate gives you exactly
this functionality.
shm_open and shm_unlink are provided by glibc 2.2. If you don't want
to rely on that, you can use open ("/dev/shm/xxx") and hope that the
admin configured right.

Yes:
fd = shm_open ("xxx",...)
ptr = mmap (NULL, size, ..., fd, offset);
No kernel changes necessary on 2.4 any more.
