    Regarding the list of planned changes for  2.5 i found that
  nothing is announced regarding DRI/DRM infrastructure.
    So i wonder whether the current situation is enough satisfactory,
  or is it just that nobody is interested in such kind of developement?
    Anyhow the current situation looks a bit odd, because we
  basically have support for a quite narrow diapasone of 3D
  accelerators.
  Does it look like the current interface could be not enough mature?
   (Note: this message is intended to catalyse
a fruitful
