I need this for suspend to disk. I really need quiescent system if I
want to write to swap image, right?
I implemented a "refrigerator" mechanism, and manually marked threads
that should not be frozen. I'm doing my best to stop everyone who
might try to wake userland.
[I just mailed the patch as 2.4.13 - swsusp. Tell me if you want a
copy.]
