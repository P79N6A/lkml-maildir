Let's be more friendly to the namespace and call it something less 
ambiguous, like MODULE_PARAM, even if that might not be strictly true in 
1% of the cases.  IMO there are certainly valid local uses of 'PARAM' in 
kernel code.
You can see from the totally gratuitous patch to 
include/asm-i386/setup.h which should have been a clue...
If this was C++ we could just stick PARAM in the "rusty" namespace and 
be done with it, but such as things are......  ;-)
