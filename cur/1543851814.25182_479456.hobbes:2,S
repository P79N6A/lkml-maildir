that is your own problem and in fact a very good reason to reject your
change. In linux, device mapper deals with such "raid", and your change
will block that.
Reverse engineering such raid is usually a one day effort, and it will
be done.. and that is a good thing. Trying to make that impossible is
just even dishonest [1].
[1] See Greg Kroah's OLS keynote. It's one thing to think your "raid IP"
is worth more than the Linux kernels IP, it's another one to sabotage
the Linux kernel to protect your "raid IP".
