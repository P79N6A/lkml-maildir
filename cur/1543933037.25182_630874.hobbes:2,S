Actually, the code to finding one '\n' is still needed to avoid the 
(pathological) case of getting a "\No newline", so scrap that one which 
was too aggressive, and use this (simpler) one instead.
Not that it matters in real life, since nobody uses -U0, and "git blame" 
won't care. But let's get it right anyway ;)
This whole function has had more bugs than it has lines.
