Subject: [PATCH] disable VT on iSeries by default

Andrew,
This patch from Julie DeWandel makes CONFIG_VT default to N on iSeries
machines which are using the iSeries virtual console driver viocons.c.
The VT console and the viocons code can't coexist because they use the
same tty numbers, that is, viocons supplies /dev/tty1.  Without this
patch the user has to figure out somehow that s/he has to turn on
CONFIG_EMBEDDED in order to be able to turn off CONFIG_VT, which is
really very non-obvious.
Please apply.
Thanks,
Paul.
