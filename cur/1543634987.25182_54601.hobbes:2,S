Er, oops, I think this one's my fault.
The recent driverfs additions for SCSI also added partition handling in 
driverfs.  The code is slightly more invasive than it should be so the IDE 
driver needs to know how to use it (which it doesn't yet).  In theory there's 
a NULL pointer check in driverfs_create_partitions for precisely this case, 
but it looks like the IDE code is forgetting to zero out a kmalloc of a struct 
gendisk somewhere (hence the 5a5a... contents).  At a cursory glance, this 
seems to be in ide/probe.c, so does the attached patch fix it?
I'll try to reproduce, but I'm all SCSI here except for my laptop.
