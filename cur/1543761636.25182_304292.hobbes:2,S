Not subscribed, so please forgive the unthreaded post.
As per K.R. Foley's report, booting on SMP fails. I tried & failed to 
capture the boot messages via serial, so the best I can offer is a pic 
of what remained visible on screen at the death.

I suspect there was more prior to that, but so far that's the best I can 
offer.
Booting with maxcpus=1 didn't fail completely, but also suffered dramas. 
Loss of usb mouse was the most noticable. If that scenario might be 
interesting or helpful, I'll pursue it further.
cheers, Cal
