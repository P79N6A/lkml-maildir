Yes indeed :)

That 'maximum delay' is collected on each jackd process cycle. AFAICS, it
is the figure of a scheduling delay, as measured by jackd as the time
interval between interrupt and effective jackd process handler (re)entry.
Please note that I'm not a JACK developer. I'm just a regular user
with ancient coding skills ;) I do however subscribe to the jackit-devel
maillist. And the author of qjackctl, if that matters...
For reading this 'maximum delay' I am actually using a custom patch
against jack-0.99.7cvs, being a Lee Revell's original.

Ouch. This is a bit too much to digest in so little time :) I'll try to
re-read this from cache, erm... tomorrow ;)
BTW, this means that I have to re-enable LATENCY_TIMING back again? Notice
that all my results were taken with a production configuration, that is,
with all debug options now set to off (OK, I think I've left the
stack-overflow on, but that was the only one).
OTOH, this latency timing has been troublesome on either of my setups,
recently. But I'll give it another try...

Yes, I can add interrupts/sec measuring with nmeter. Neat utility indeed,
thanks to Denis Vlasenko.

Now that you call, I remember to hack that very same line, some time go,
but couldn't get no better than a udelay(33). Removing that line just
ended in some kind of malfunction, but can't remember what exactly. One
thing's for sure, sound didn't came out of it :-/

Now that's really pushing me over. Any ALSA-JACK developers around here to
comment?
Bye now.
