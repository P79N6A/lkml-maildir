   This seems to be an artifact of some OBP implementations for PPC-
   apples in particular.
   It assigns both I/O and Mem addrs and IRQs, but doesn't enable
   either memory or I/O. So you have to do it for it.
Yeah, but this doesn't belong in the drivers that is for sure.
It belongs in arch/ppc/kernel/*pci*.c
This is precisely the kind of compat stuff which should be fixed up in
the arch-specific PCI support code.
