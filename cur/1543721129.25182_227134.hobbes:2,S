This is precisely the reason why I am concerned about having "rich"
ethtool semantics. A unified, standard interface is great,... as long
it does not leave behind some features, like setting the advertised
values in autoneg. As a user of these features, I hope driver
developers will NOT remove those module_param features that cannot
migrated to ethtool.

In case any one wondered: probably the most common motivation for
manually downgrading a link is when the cabling is found to be not
"good enough" for the max common speed of the two transceivers.
(see "Gigabit Ethernet - Rich Seifert, section 8.2.3")

 "The 1000BASE-T Task Force and the cabling companies estimate that
 less than 10 percent of the installed base of Category 5 cable was
 improperly installed,"
I find "less than 10 percent" not so negligible.
