We thought that an atomic_t was better when you suggested that we could
drop the spinlock after we added a semaphore to struct usb_serial_port
recently. Won't we drop the spinlock as suggested?
Anyway, I don't see yet why the atomic_t would make the code slower on
non-smp. Is atomic_add_unless(v, 1, 1) supposed to be slower than
'if (!v) v = 1;' ?
If it is really slower, is atomic_cmpxchg() supposed to be slower, too?
("Check it yourself" is a valid answer, too  :)   But maybe someone
could elighten me and I could save some time testing and checking the
generated code)
