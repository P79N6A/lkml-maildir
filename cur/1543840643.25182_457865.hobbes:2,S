Subject: [PATCH] exit_io_context: don't disable irqs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/26/33

We don't need to disable irqs to clear current->io_context, it is protected
by ->alloc_lock. Even IF it was possible to submit I/O from IRQ on behalf of
current this irq_disable() can't help: current_io_context() will re-instantiate
->io_context after irq_enable().
We don't need task_lock() or local_irq_disable() to clear ioc->task. This can't
prevent other CPUs from playing with our io_context anyway.
