Yes, typically, on Apple north bridges, you have the PIO space memory
mapped somewhere in the CPU address space, generating IO cycles from 0
to N (usually 16Mb), but the MMIO space is directly mapped 1:1 from
0x8000000.

Port IO should be fine in most cases (there might be one or 2 weird cases
with earlier models, but overall, it's fine). The typical case is a machine
using Apple "UniNorth" chipset (the one that supports AGP, been out for a while
now), since the AGP slot and the PCI bus are on 2 separate domains. Both can
do Port IO at any low address, but they are completely separate domains.
All this could be very nicely dealt with by the kernel driver.
Ben.
