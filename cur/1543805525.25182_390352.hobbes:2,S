But making up a new naming scheme which you happen to consider
more appropriate doesn't sound to me like a good solution. Not
even if you have good reasons for your likes/dislikes.
If I ported some Linux program to Windows I would not ask
the user if they wanted to save to /dev/hda5, or /mnt/c_drive
because I consider C: bad naming.
