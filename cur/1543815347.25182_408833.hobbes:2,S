Hi !
I m student.
I want to apply low-latency patch to kernel 2.4.26  for ARM processor.
I applied Andrew Morton's low latency patch of 2.4.25kernel to 2.4.26
kernel. I made some changes for '.config' section  to apply it
correctly to ARM. Can anybody tell me whether i m right or wrong ? It
is not giving any error while applying patch.
Second thing,
Can anybody please tell me how to measure scheduler latency for kernel
on ARM after applying low-latency patch to measure kernel's
responsiveness?
Thanks in advance!
