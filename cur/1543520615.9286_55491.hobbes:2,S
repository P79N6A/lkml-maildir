I think I said that it is obviously unacceptable but I don't mind to
repeat the obvious things. Namely, the amount of RAM in a node is a
phenomenological constant the exact value of which should be irrelevant in
non-failing cases. Of course, most sysadmins would have a rough idea on
how much memory their nodes have but they don't *have* to. A human being
should just be able to tell the system "make me a ramdisk of size 64M with
ext2 filesystem on it". If it succeeds then the human has the right to
expect it to work. If it fails, *then* and only then he can ask
(especially if its ENOMEM) "why did it fail?" and the answer which then
turns phenomenological feature into pragmatical reality is "because you
don't have enough physical RAM". That is how UNIX systems work and that is
how therefore Linux system should work.
But, as I don't know yet how to fix it, arguing further about it is rather
silly on my side - Iam trying to learn enough to fix it.
Regards,
Tigran.
