the message appears when the period (fragment) has not been processed
enough fast as expected.  a typical reason is the delay of hardware
interrupts, but this could be, of course, a bug of the driver, too.
this would be a bit problem if the application uses small numbers of
periods.  but in the case of xmms, it won't be serious.
if you don't see such a message not too often, you can ignore it...
(at least, i've never heard about this kind of bug on ens1371 driver.)
