I'm not saying it should, but it would be good from a PR perspective and as
an element in the reliability feeling vector ;-)

The number of -pre releases shouldn't be limited for its own sake, but
rather in the process of stabilising the kernel for release. So I mean after
a couple of -pre releases start focussing on debugging and then finish with
a few -rc's before the next cycle starts. That way the diffs between full
versions are smaller and upgrading gets easier.

yup, I'm getting there :-) Would be nice to have the smartcard reader
working as well... Some things I can't test because I don't have the
hardware (IEEE1394, wireless lan, irda). power management is still quite
magical to me though ;-)
