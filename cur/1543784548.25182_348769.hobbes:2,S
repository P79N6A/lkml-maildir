Subject: [WATCHDOG] Push SBC8360 driver upstream

I would like to ask that the SBC8360 watchdog driver be pushed upstream from
-mm in time for the 2.6.14-rc series.
I recognise that this driver, like a lot of the watchdog drivers, is for a
piece of hardware this is present in only a very small percentage of
hardware runnig Linux. I doubt that being in -mm for a long time will make
any significant difference to it being more widely tested. The driver is
working perfectly as expected on each of the machines we've tested it on.
As a recap, the driver was submitted to akpm, was included in -mm1
(watchdog-new-sbc8360-driver.patch), offloaded to Wim's
linux-2.6-watchdog-mm.git tree (commit
88b1f50923d14195ac1a50840fc4aa4066f067a9), and subsequently included in -mm2
by way of the combined git-watchdog.patch.
Please consider merging this driver into 2.6.14-rc1. Thanks.
Regards,
Ian Morgan
