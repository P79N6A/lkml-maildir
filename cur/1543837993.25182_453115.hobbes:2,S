Hi,
my wlan gives up working somewhere between upgrading to gcc-4.1, changing some 
kernel options and upgrading to linux-2.8.16-r4.
Now I get following from iwconfig:
eth2      NOT READY!  ESSID:off/any
          Mode:Master  Channel:0  Access Point: Not-Associated
          Tx-Power=31 dBm   Sensitivity=0/200
          Retry min limit:0   RTS thr=-1 B   Fragment thr=-1 B
          Encryption key:off
          Link Quality:27  Signal level:0  Noise level:0
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0
But I'm not able to get infromation why this device isn't ready.
dmesg is not reporting an error.
So, has someone an idea of how to get some informations to solve this problem?
regards
Daniel
