Filesystems basically disable using barriers on a device which doesn't
support them, which is indicated by -EOPNOTSUPP. Barriers are allowed to
fail in such fashion.
Now the interesting question is what happens when barriers are suddenly
verboten on a stack which used to support them - because the new mapping
doesn't support it _anymore_. Hrm. _Should_ work, but probably not
tested much ;-)
