Probably true for x86, but the cost is noticeable on ppc64, for example. 
Anton fixed some things in there shortly after it went in, but it's still
apparent on profiles.
We could perhaps speed things up a little bit by using gang lookup in both
__do_page_cache_readahead() and in do_generic_file_read().
