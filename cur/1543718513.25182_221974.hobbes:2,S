The comments in ext3_find_near() pretty well cover things.
The "colouring" implementation in there is to address some problems which
were exacerbated by the Orlov inode allocator.  When we're determining the
initial block for a new file the allocator was essentially doing first-fit
within the blockgroup.  So multiple files kept on having their blocks
jumbled up.
So the colouring essentially tries to start a new file at a random position
in its blockgroup.  But it ensures that if one task is creating a lot of
files (say, an untar), these are all nicely contiguous within the
blockgroup.  That's why the pid was used as the colour.  A reasonable
heuristic.  It improves the many-processes-creating-fiels problem, but
doesn't do much for the one-process-creates-lots-of-slowly-growing-files
problem.

I think that'll probabyl work OK.  If the application is seekily growing
the file the layout is awful already.

Yes, we definitely want to avoid that CPU-intensive search on every write.

You might need it for the very first block allocation.  For example, if the
app opens an existing file and starts appending to it, does the current
code correctly commence allocation immediately beyond the file's final
block?

Well.  It'll be some block within the reservation window - the code should
be recording how far across the reservation window we currently are.  We
don't want to do a linear search across the entire reservation window for
each block allocation attempt.

It would be nice to separate the old allocation things (i_alloc_block,
i_alloc_goal, etc) from the new code completely.  Making one somehow
dependent upon or aware fo the other is confusing, and ultimately we'd like
to remove those fields from the inode altogether.
So maybe it's best to avoid calling ext3_find_near() and ext3_find_goal()
at all if reservations are enabled.
