Not everything has a corresponding sysfs name, which really makes the

I might not of been clear - path name of the file in the kernel source
tree.  So if you add an event to fs/open.c the path is
"/org/kernel/fs/open".  This is a pretty generic naming scheme that
ensures names will be unique within the kernel and will not conflict
with names outside the kernel (e.g. the global URI space of whatever is
used in user-space).

Agreed.  Not passing the data and just passing a "change occurred" flag
is a good idea in many cases.  For example, for "new filesystem mounted"
I think it makes most sense to just send out a "new filesystem mounted"
signal and not include the data.  Let user-space rescan /proc/mtab in
response.
But we cannot do that for everything.
"high" is only an arbitrary string if it is not standardized.  If the
temperature event is defined to come from such and such an interface,
with such and such values, it is all very easy to use.  I mean, this is
how object systems work today.

This is where the sysfs naming scheme breaks down.  You now have two
different namespaces - kobjects and files on a filesystem.  We really
need something a lot simpler.  Let user-space map stuff around if we
want that.

It is policy because the question was saying "since A is usually used
with B in the context of foo, make A require B."  But
CONFIG_KERNEL_EVENTS does not require sysfs in any way.  Why force there
use together?
