Whatever the problem is, only seems to show up when ADMA is enabled, and 
so the patch that added ADMA support shows up as the culprit from your 
git bisect. However, from what Chr is reporting, 2.6.19 with the ADMA 
support added in doesn't seem to have the problem, so presumably 
something else that changed in the 2.6.20-rc series is triggering it. 
Doing a bisect while keeping the driver code itself the same will 
hopefully identify what that change is..
