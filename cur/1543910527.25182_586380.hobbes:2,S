my thinking is this: the structure of "idle time" only matters if it can 
be observed from "within" a virtual machine - via timers. Are on s390 
any of the typical app-visible timers (timer_list, etc.) driven by the 
virtual tick? [which slows down if a virtual CPU is scheduled away by 
the host/monitor/hypervisor?] Or is the virtual tick only affecting 
scheduling/cpu-accounting statistics in essence?
