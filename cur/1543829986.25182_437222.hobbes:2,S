Subject: [PATCH 1/3] rcutorture: catchup doc fixes for idle-hz tests
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/26/297

This just catches the RCU torture documentation up with the recent
fixes that test RCU for architectures that turn of the scheduling-clock
interrupt for idle CPUs and the addition of a SUCCESS/FAILURE
indication, fixing up an obsolete comment as well.
