Hi!
I maybe discovered a VIA IDE driver bug ( or maybe it is "just"
a bug in my BIOS ) :
( linux 2.4.0 and 2.4.1 same results )
1. Disable IDE Channel 0 in BIOS -> only ide1 is visible in linux
2. Disable IDE Channel 1 in BIOS -> only ide0 is visible in linux
3. Disable both channels -> linux reports ( on VT4 ) :
<4>VP_IDE:neither IDE port enabled (BIOS)
This is OK, alltough one may say that linux should use the
hardware regardless of BIOS settings.
The problem :
I enable both IDE channels in BIOS.
In BIOS I set all 4 units to "NONE",
except secondary master to MANUAL/CHS with
some dummy geometry ( otherwise the BIOS
checks the unit and initializes it; I have a CDROM
here and it seems that the BIOS always autodetects
them, no matter what I set in the CMOS setup )
When I now boot linux , ide0 is not detected !
This is the output on VT4:
...
<6> Uniform Multi Platform E-IDE driver 6.31
<4> ide: assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
<4>VP_IDE: IDE controller on PCIbus 00 dev 39
<4>VP_IDE:chipset revision 16
<4>VP_IDE:not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
<4>VP_IDE:VIA vt82c686a IDE UDMA66 controller on pci0:7.1
<4> ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd000-0xd007, BIOS setting: hda:pio, hdb:pio
<4> ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd008-0xd00f, BIOS setting: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
<4> hdc: CD-532E-B, ATAPI CDROM drive
<4> ide: assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
<4>ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
<4>hdc: ATAPI 32x CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache,DMA
<4>Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.11
... SCSI stuff ...
Observations:
We have a "ide0: BM-DMA at 0x..." line for ide0, but nothing else.
hda is not detected, no "ide0 at 0xxxx...." line.
Hardware: 
MSI K7T Pro2 motherboard , AWARD BIOS 6.0 v1.8
VIA KT133 chipset , v82c686a southbridge
AMD Duron 700MHz CPU
IDE Primary master   : Quantum Fireball lct20 harddisk 20 GB
IDE Primary slave    : nothing
IDE Secondary master : Teac CD532E-B , CDROM drive
IDE Secondary slave  : nothing
both set to "cable select"
both cables are ATA-66 , 80-wire cables
( the system is not oveclocked :-)
