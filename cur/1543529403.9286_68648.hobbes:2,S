Ok. This discussion is serveral YEARS old. So do not hold you breath.
There were lots and lots of discussion about this and fewdifferent patches
are floating around for ages (in 2.2.15pre some OOM patches was tried;
perhaps 2.2.15 will include one of them). But ALL patches are designed to help
in case of run-away process and NOT protect against malicious user.
P.S. Of course if you'll be able to cook up patch and solve this outstanding
problem still not solved after few years of exercises by Linux's memory
wizards you are welcome. Just don't think it's so easy :-(
