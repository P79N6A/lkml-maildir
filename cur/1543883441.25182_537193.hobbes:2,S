Take a look at utrace in -mm, it offers a completely backwards compatible
ptrace() syscall implemented as a module ontop of it. utrace looks like the
way things will be going forward

Think of ptrace() implemented using utrace as ptrace that "Sucks Less TM".
Maybe Andy will let utrace out of -mm for 2.6.23.
