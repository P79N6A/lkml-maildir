http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8587
 has a similar
report: it lists 2.6.22-rc3-git7 as OK but 2.6.22-rc4 as broken.
I can easily reproduce the problem in 2.6.22-rc4. There are no
sata_promise changes between rc3 and rc4, but Tejun's libata
polling SETXFER change was included in rc4. Reverting it makes
sata_promise work again for me.
I suspect that sata_promise.c:pdc_interrupt() should detect
a qc w/ ATA_TFLAG_POLLING, treat the interrupt as spurious,
and just call ata_chk_status(qc), similar to how sata_inic162x.c,
sata_nv.c, sata_sil.c, and sata_vsc.c do things.
Jeff/Tejun: comments?
