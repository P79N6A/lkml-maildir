No.  Rewriting something from scratch is horrible engineering practice.
It's impossible to very huge changes, small incremental changes OTOH
allow easier planning, easier calculation of the risks and cost and most
import better test coverage.  There's nothing specific to scsi or linux
kernel code about it.  It'd suggest you read:

or various similar articles.  Full scale rewrites almost never work
out.
