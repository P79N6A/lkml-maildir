No problem I can see the whole boot log. The ATARAID driver never loads.
Could you force it to load somehow?
I get these messages:
PDC20271: IDE controller at PCI slot 00:09.0
PCI: Found IRQ 12 for device 00.09.0
PCI: Sharing IRQ 12 with 00:04.2
PDC20271: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
	ide2: BM-DMA at ...
	ide3: BM-DMA at ...
then it finds the disks:
hde: WDC ...
hdg: WDC ... 
partition check:
hde: hde1, hde2
hdg: hdg1, hdg2
ide: late registration of driver

I believe that should do it. dmesg doesn't have any info about the ataraid
driver being loaded? If it's scrolling out of the kernel buffer, you can try
bumping up the size through the kernel config. The option is under the
"Kernel Hacking" section and is CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT. Change it to 17 or 18
to be sure.
A reboot with this new kernel should give you a full dmesg afterward,
hopefully showing what's wrong with the ataraid stuff.

PS. I don't remember when this took place, but there were some changes to
the promise drivers in 2.4 around 2.4.21 I think. There should be drivers
for both the older Promise and the newer. I remember always choosing both,
complete with pdcraid just to be sure.
