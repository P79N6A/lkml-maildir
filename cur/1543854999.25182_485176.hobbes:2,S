any news on this? I didn't see the patch in 2.6.19-rc6-mm1, but maybe I
overlooked it.. :)
I'm currently using 2.6.19-rc6 and I have the same problem with my
Asus P5W Deluxe mainboard (BIOS v1407).
I have two disks attached, it seems detection fails on the SATA port
where no disk is connected.
BIOS is configured to use AHCI, kernel parameters are: 
kernel (hd0,0)/boot/2619rc6 init=/linuxrc root=/dev/ram0 rw hda=ide-cd
mousepoll=1
attached: complete output of dmesg/messages and lspci -vv
