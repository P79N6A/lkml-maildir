   Yes, sure.  However in certain commonly used register poor 32-bit
architechtures doing 64-bit adding/comparing is rather memory intensive
thing, as the processor must keep loading items for processing.
Basic adding, substracting, comparing, and shifting are handled by
the gcc internal templates, but more complex things like division,
modulus, and multiplying usually aren't...

I am usually doing great lengths of code massage to get away without
the need to do generic division or modulus operations (or multiplications,
though those are rare) in the kernel.
You see, usually  (long long)/(const int)  (and modulus of the same)
doesn't collapse in the optimization phase at i386 into some neat
	(long long) >> const_shift_value
expressions, even when it could.
Related: The reason why the HZ at Alpha is 1024, and not 1000, seems
to be ability to do certain "divisions" with simple shifts.
(Alpha does not have division instruction, rather one must use
 an assembly subroutine for one bit at a time division -- but
 executing it 64 rounds within the icache is faster, than trying
 more advanced resiprocal table lookups -- just because single
 cache miss can take more time, than executing the iterator..)
