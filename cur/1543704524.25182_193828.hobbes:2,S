	I am now having this problem. See the thread "Kernels > 2.6.1-mm3 do not 
boot." I had a kernel that would hang after uncompressing. Seems that gcc 3.3 
generates bad code w/ -funit-at-a-time. Now I get the test_wp_bit oops w/ 
kernel version 2.6.2-rc2-mm2.
	Since I have already commented out the line.. and it led to this oops, what 
the heck is the real problem here?
	Seems alot of other SMP systems are breaking with this too.
