sorry I didn't noticed the overlap of page->mapping to store the mm. But
yes, I should have realized that you had do because otherwise you
wouldn't know how to flush the tlb ;) so without the mm and address rmap
would be useless. So via the address and mapping you can walk the
pagetables and reach it with lower complexity than w/o rmap. Still doing
the pagetable walk wouldn't be an huge increase in complexity but it
would increase the "computational" complexity of the algorithm.
