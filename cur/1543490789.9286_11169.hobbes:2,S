SMBfs seems to be slightly flaky.  I have had it lose files in
directories
with large numbers of entries (although I haven't seen this recently -
possibly
its been fixed).  
Also, you can't 'mount -o loop' over an SMB share, as you get an error. 
The only
reason I can think of for this is the data in the image is corrupting in
some way.

If only NT had an NFS server... sigh.
