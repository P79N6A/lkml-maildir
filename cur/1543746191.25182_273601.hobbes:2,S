I tested it on 2.6.9-ac10 and there are no problems here
(Slackware-current)... I have udev and devfs though.
BTW: i have the line
KERNEL="tty[p-za-e][0-9a-f]*", NAME="pty/s%n", SYMLINK="%k"
in my /etc/udev/rules.d/udev.rules (don't know if this will fix your
problem, but i hope so! :). I changed this line (originally
NAME="tty/s%n") to fix my not working /usr/bin/less.
