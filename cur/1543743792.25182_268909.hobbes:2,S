Subject: shmem_file_setup not exported

I noticed this change in mm/shmem.c:
-EXPORT_SYMBOL(shmem_file_setup);
Is there a reason for this, other than nobody using it?
I used that function in a module I wrote, mostly as a proof of
concept, for someone who was looking for a way to unmap memory pages
while retaining their contents, and being able to map them later.
