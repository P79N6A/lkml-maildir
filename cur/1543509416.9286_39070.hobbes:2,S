I think, the problem is, that ls opens "." in the current directory and
reads the direntries from "."
But the directory "." is in this case different from the cwd, because it
refers to the filesystgem just mounted! So ls gets the names of the
files in the directory which was just mounted and not the names of the
files in cwd.
The reason why "ls" says "No such file or directory" is, if you want to
have the output colored (you probably have an alias ls='ls --color=yes'
or sth.), ls makes an "lstat"-syscall for each filename. But this time,
lstat searches in cwd (which, as we know, isn't the same as ".", where
the filenames were taken from), cannot find the entry and returns
-ENOENT.
The reason why it worked with "strace" is, that strace doesn't use your
alias and so ls-output isn't colored, ls doesn't lstat the files it read
from "."...
If I'm wrong, please correct me...
