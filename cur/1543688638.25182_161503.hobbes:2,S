Changes:
Mainly a resync.
The conversion of nice 19+ priority tasks to batch scheduling was cleaned up.
A partial merge of the interactivity changes in 2.6-test* - O19int was done 
(no nanosecond resolution, no flagging of high credit tasks and 10ms 
timeslice granularity in this version).
All low latency points in swapfile.c were removed due to causing hanging in 
swapoff in combination with ckvm.
All non i386 arch changes were removed as they were getting increasingly 
broken and noone was reporting success with them (sorry).
Please feel free to send comments, suggestions, queries, bugreports, patches 
and requests.
