Its a question of staging.  This still lives in the 'sii-m15w' branch of 
libata-dev.git, but if we throw too many _classes_ of changes into the 
same big lump, then it becomes much more difficult to discern which 
changes caused which failures.
Since sata_sil has seen several changes, and since the sii-m15w problems 
are so difficult to diagnose properly, its easier to separate that out.
