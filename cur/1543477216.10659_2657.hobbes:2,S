    zaphod# hdparm -i /dev/hda
    /dev/hda:
     Model=FUJITSU MPA3035ATU, FwRev=9517, SerialNo=01113969
     Config={ HardSect NotMFM HdSw>15uSec Fixed DTR>10Mbs RotSpdTol>.5% }
     RawCHS=4092/16/63, TrkSize=0, SectSize=0, ECCbytes=4
     BuffType=0(?), BuffSize=0kB, MaxMultSect=32, MultSect=32
     DblWordIO=no, maxPIO=2(fast), DMA=yes, maxDMA=0(slow)
     CurCHS=4092/16/63, CurSects=4124736, LBA=yes, LBAsects=4124736
     tDMA={min:120,rec:120}, DMA modes: mword0 mword1 *mword2 
     IORDY=yes, tPIO={min:240,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4 
    It looks like the results of the hdparm are the same.
(Except for CurCHS.)
    My guess is that 2.1.131 get the logical params from the BIOS
    and 2.2.0pre5/6 calculates them from the physical ones.
    I'll try to set the geometry manually tonight.
Your guess is close to the truth. But reading the code is easier
than experimenting.
It is a funny disk. Fujitsu model numbers have the size in the last
three digits, so a FUJITSU MPA3035ATU is a 3.5 GB disk, which agrees
with your claim that it has 6780 cylinders (6780*16*63*512=3499130880).
However, RawCHS and CurCHS and LBAsects and CurSects all say that the
disk has 4092*16*63=4124736 sectors. Strange..
Anyway, this gives me the opportunity to change a strange line
in the ide-disk.c source:

[Of course the DEBUG part can also be deleted, since we have
all information that is printed by it, and the lines like
	drive->id->cur_cyls    = drive->bios_cyl;
should also be deleted everywhere. After all, the idea of the
HDIO_GET_IDENTITY ioctl is to tell the users what the disk
hardware replied to the IDENTIFY DRIVE command. This is read-only
information that we should not fiddle with. But the above patch
is the minimal one that fixes the problem, if I am not mistaken.]
