 Q2.4*: I installed ISA PnP tools, but still awedrv says "can't detect
AWE32".
   Check WaveTable entries in your /etc/isapnp.conf file. AWE32 uses
   three I/O ports, normally 0x620, 0xa20, and 0xe20, but in the default
   ouput from pnpdump is lack of the last two pots (0xa20 and 0xe20). In
   such a case, you have to add them manually. For example,
# Logical device id CTL0021
(CONFIGURE CTL0044/962642 (LD 2
# ANSI string -->WaveTable<-- 
  (IO 0 (BASE 0x0620))
  (IO 1 (BASE 0x0A20))
  (IO 2 (BASE 0x0E20))
  (ACT Y)
))
   See the ISA PnP FAQ page (
   
http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/isapnpfaq.html
 ) for
   details.
