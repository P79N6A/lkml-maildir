Didn't he say it worked in 2.2? If that's true then perhaps it should in
2.4 and later.
I've given up a bought a USB flash adaptor, my ISA bus PCMCIA adaptor
hasn't worked for flash since about 2.4.16 or so. Not a complaint, but
there may be issues in that support, I just didn't have time to fight with
the problem.
