Yes.

The software you have was written to use one API.
Old kernels did not provide that API.
Old libc used a similar API as a substitute.
Lock inheritance did not work as apps expected.
Stuff broke. People lost email and other data.
Now we have the desired API implemented correctly.
Anything using the old API is suspect.
Some old Linux-specific apps would work fine.
Apps that really needed what was asked for...
