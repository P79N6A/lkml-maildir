Subject: max number of threads on a system

What limits the number of threads one can have on a Linux system?
I have a simple program that creates an array of threads and it locks up at the creation of somewhere between 250 and 275 threads.
The program just hangs indefinately unless a Control-C is hit.
How can I increase this number or can I?
Thanks, Joe
