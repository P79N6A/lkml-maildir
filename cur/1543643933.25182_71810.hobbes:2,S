Count the total lines of code in the kernel.  It's less than it was
before.  Even for ia64, it's around the same IIRC.
Now add the userspace code, and it's obviously far simpler.  Not to
mention not having to worry about problems like insmod dying between
the two system calls...
I'm all for keeping things out of the kernel, but you can take things
too far.  I was originally reluctant, but the beauty and simplicity of
doing it in-kernel changed my mind.

Huh?  Think about initramfs's insmod code.  Think about busybox.  Look
at my insmod code.
Sure, *modprobe* has some complexity to it, but a simple insmod is
trivial.

Yes.  It should be added everywhere.  One idea is to mark interfaces
which are "safe", and if a module uses something else, refuse to
unload it.

Yes, you force reference counts in everything, whether you've got
modules (or module unloading) or not.  You *do not* want to do this,
for performance reasons if nothing else.

I really like this, myself (although I did it in two stages in my
earlier implementation, it's the same principle).  I could use it
really nicely.  You could use it really nicely.  I can name a dozen
more that would get it right.
<Sigh>
Unfortunately, saying "you must understand module races to write a
module" is not realistic 8(.  Look at this code for an example of
understanding of current modules among kernel developers: (lib/crc32.c):
/**
 * init_crc32(): generates CRC32 tables
 * 
 * On successful initialization, use count is increased.
 * This guarantees that the library functions will stay resident
 * in memory, and prevents someone from 'rmmod crc32' while
 * a driver that needs it is still loaded.
 * This also greatly simplifies drivers, as there's no need
 * to call an initialization/cleanup function from each driver.
 * Since crc32.o is a library module, there's no requirement
 * that the user can unload it.
 */
static int __init init_crc32(void)
{
	int rc1, rc2, rc;
	rc1 = crc32init_le();
	rc2 = crc32init_be();
	rc = rc1 || rc2;
	if (!rc) MOD_INC_USE_COUNT;
	return rc;
}

The backwards compatibility issue is simple to handle in userspace:
try sys_query_module, and exec insmod.old if it doesn't give ENOSYS.
Sure, I'm lazy, but I'll release a 0.4 which does that I promise 8)
