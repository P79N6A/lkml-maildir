This is broken.
Triple broken.
It's broken, because it doesn't take into account the fact that Intel 
broke CPUID level 4 and made it "repeating" (neither did the cpuid char 
device, because it predated the Intel braindamage; I've had a patch for 
it privately for a while, but didn't push it upstream because paravirt 
broke it royally and I wanted the situation to settle down.)
It's broken, because the algorithm used to determine valid CPUID levels 
is incorrect; it fails to recognize any CPUID levels other than the main 
Intel and AMD ones, e.g. the Transmeta 0x8086xxxx (and sometimes more) 
and VIA 0xc000xxxx levels.
It's broken, because it is better for the userspace extractor to have 
this logic than to stuff it into the kernel, where it sits hogging 
unswappable memory at all times.
