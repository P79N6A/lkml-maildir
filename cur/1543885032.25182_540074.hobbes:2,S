Peter has a good point here.  We have been reloading segments historically
so the existing boot loaders won't fall over.  If we could load the gdt
in the paravirt solutions all would be simple.
We have real mystery historical cases in Gujin and ELILO.  So it
probably makes sense at this point to force a gdt reload if we can and
otherwise require all of the segments %ds, %es, %fs, %gs to be loaded
with a valid segment, that we can reach everything we need to touch
from.
