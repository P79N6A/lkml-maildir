This is probably th eimportant part. Most heavy RAID 2.2.x users have in
fact probably already used the "new" 2.4.x interface for some time.
I do agree with Alan, though: the decision on making that the _official_
2.2.x interface is a nasty decision. It will screw some people, and they
would be right in being unhappy about interface changes in the middle of a
stable kernel release.
For 2.2.x I suspect that 0.90 should continue to just be a (common) extra
patch.
