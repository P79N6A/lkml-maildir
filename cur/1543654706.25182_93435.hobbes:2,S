I'd rather avoid pushing the 2.5.x core code for the dscc4 chipset in
2.4 now as some side of it still suck. Is it fine to wait for me to 
update current 2.4.x dscc4 code to new api ? ETA = now + a few days at 
worst.
Btw if someone can get in touch with Infineon, it would be interesting to
know if recent releases of the chipset still behaves as the old ones 
(I only have rather old ones).
