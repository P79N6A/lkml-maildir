I think it's in general risky. It's like balancing without a safety
net.  Might be a nice hobby, but for real production you want a safety
net.  That's simple because there are likely some code paths through
the code that need more stack space and that are rarely hit (and
cannot be easily found by static analysis, e.g. if they involve
indirect pointers or particularly complex configuration setups). With
very tight stack space you're much nearer a crash in extreme
situations than otherwise.
So I think it's a bad idea to change this.
