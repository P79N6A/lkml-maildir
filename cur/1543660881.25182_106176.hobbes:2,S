Unfortunately not until Friday. I only take one PCMCIA adaptor with me on
the road, so I can't try two until I get back to the office. I'll try
inserting two and removing the "first" one at that time. Any particular
kernel you think will or won't have this problem? It's easier to try on
2.4 unless you think it's a new 2.5 issue; My ISA/PCMCIA adaptor hasn't
been working with 2.5, I could update a laptop if needed.
