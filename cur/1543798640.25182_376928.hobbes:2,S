I'd like to qualify that.  "for architectures with native cmpxchg".
For general consumption (not specifically related to mutex stuff)...
For architectures with llsc, sequences stuch as:
	load
	modify
	cmpxchg
are inefficient because they have to be implemented as:
	load
	modify
	load
	compare
	store conditional
Now, if we consider using llsc as the basis of atomic operations:
	load
	modify
	store conditional
and for cmpxchg-based architectures:
	load
	modify
	cmpxchg
Notice that the cmpxchg-based case does _not_ get any worse - in fact
it's exactly identical.  Note, however, that the llsc case becomes
more efficient.
