2.6.22-rc2, only EVENT_TRACE - boots, can't rerpoduce
2.6.21-vanila - can reproduce
2.6.21-rt7, trace options off - can reproduce
2.6.21-rt7, trace options on - can't reproduce
Possibly something timing related, that's altered by the trace code.
I tried the trace kernel without starting the trace app, but still no
bug.
Any other ideas?
Thanks,
Miklos
