Then propose an alternative way where a real-time (SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR)
CPU bound application getting lots of SEGVs for normal operation doesn't
cause a priority inversion with the debugger getting SIGCHLDs for every
SEGV and deciding to ignore it?
This way avoids the unnecessary context switch to the debugger, and is
intended for use only by someone who knows darn sure that s/he will
handle the signal safely, and don't mind if the debugger is not notified
(in fact would love it if that's the case) on specific signals.
IMHO this is a perfectly safe capability...
