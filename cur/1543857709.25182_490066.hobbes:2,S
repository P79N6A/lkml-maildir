Well actually..  With a patch like this, if any hunk clashes with a subsystem
maintainer's tree I'll usually just drop that hunk, or I'll fix it up so
that it applies to the maintainer's devel tree and won't merge it until the
maintainer has merged with mainline.
Or, if the maintainer is being sluggish, I'll just drop the problematic hunk
and I'll merge the rest with Linus.
IOW, what I merge with Linus is that part of the patch which doesn't
conflict with any of the subsystem trees.
Of course, if your subsystem tree isn't in -mm then you lose.
