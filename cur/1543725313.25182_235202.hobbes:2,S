Could you try running
/bin/gzip -dc /home/sam/bk/kernel-2.6.8rc2.tar.gz | tar -xf -
in an empty directory.
If that fails try:
/bin/gzip -dc /home/sam/bk/kernel-2.6.8rc2.tar.gz 
eventually redirected to /dev/null
Also try to check the size of the .tar.gz file.
My tar.gz file:
 $ ll  /home/sam/bk/kernel-2.6.8rc2.tar.gz
 -rw-r--r--  1 sam users 153725342 Jul 20 00:17 /home/sam/bk/kernel-2.6.8rc2.tar.gz
If the .tar.gz file is broken try uncomenting the rm from the Makefile
and execute rpmbuild manually.
