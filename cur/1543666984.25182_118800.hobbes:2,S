Murray,
  Bugs 389 and 413 show the "last update" date was  March 12th which 
dosen't fall
within the two week criteria.    The search is done only on the "last 
update" and
has nothing to do with severity.    Since you added comments to those 
bugs it set
the date then.   I realize this is not a perfect system to list all bugs 
that are truly
not being worked on,  but hopefully it gets some bugs investigated  
Especially the
ones owned by bugme-janitors.
