Hey all,
I have checked out the archives, and I found an old post regarding this.
The solution in the post, however, did not work for me.  I am attempting to
raise the maximum 32 group per user limit on my 2.4.2 kernel.  I patched
both linux/include/linux/limits.h and the asm-i386/param.h, replacing the
default "32" with "256."  My glibc is 2.1.2.  When I make clean, and
recompile the kernel, it boots fine but I am still limited to 32 groups.  I
don't need to do anything with glibc since it is of the 2.1 or greater
category, correct?  Any ideas, hints, tricks?  Thanks a ton for your help,
please CC me as I've not been approved yet as a member of this list.
