'make silentoldconfig' produces:
SCSI debugging host simulator (SCSI_DEBUG) [N/m/y/?] n
ESP Scsi Driver Core (SCSI_ESP_CORE) [N/m/y] (NEW) ?
Sorry, no help available for this option yet.
ESP Scsi Driver Core (SCSI_ESP_CORE) [N/m/y] (NEW) 
and grovelling around inside origin.patch find a nicely done driver calling
itself esp_scsi[ch].  Unfortunately, the only hint as to what devices this
applies to (or whether it's in fact a new driver *CORE*, similar to the
recent FireWire and mac80211 driver core rewrites), is found in this array:
static const char *esp_chip_names[] = {
       "ESP100",
       "ESP100A",
       "ESP236",
       "FAS236",
       "FAS100A",
       "FAST",
       "FASHME",
};
I'm presuming some Kconfig help will land before the 2.6.22 merge window
closes? :)
