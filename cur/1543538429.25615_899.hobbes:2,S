Just adding some more information about AIX SIGDANGER:
The system monitors the number of free paging space blocks and detects when a
paging-space shortage exists. When the number of free paging-space blocks falls
below a threshold known as the paging-space warning level, the system informs
all processes (except kprocs) of this condition by sending the SIGDANGER
signal. If the shortage continues and falls below a second threshold known as
the paging-space kill level, the system sends the SIGKILL signal to processes
that are the major users of paging space and that do not have a signal handler
for the  SIGDANGER signal (the default action for the SIGDANGER signal is to
ignore the signal). The system continues sending SIGKILL signals until the
number of free paging-space blocks is above the paging-space kill level.
(...)
It is possible to overcommit resources when using the late allocation algorithm
for paging space allocation. In this case, when one process gets the resource
before another, a failure results. The operating system attempts to avoid
complete system failure by killing processes affected by the resource
overcommitment. The  SIGDANGER signal is sent to notify processes that the
amount of free paging space is low. If the paging space situation reaches an
even more critical state, selected processes that did not receive the SIGDANGER
signal are sent a SIGKILL signal.
