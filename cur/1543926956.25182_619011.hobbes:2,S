I'm not really familiar with kinit, but it sounds unfair to hinder new 
features because it would reduce the usefulness of another project.
kinit should have nothing to fear, as its purpose would not be to add new 
features, but rather to modularize the boot process, by replacing the 
current init, and thus allow for more flexibility to add/modify features.
Thanks!
