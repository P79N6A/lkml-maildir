Well, it is offtopic, but if someone finally asked - I also want
digest... I do not care for MIME - most of messages came as plain text
or as quoted printable - both readable without too much effort. And if
some patch is BASE64, it is not too hard to extract it out, if it looks
really interesting.

Me too. Since end of August I'm almost only browsing my mailbox, looking
what new arrived. With digests, only few arrived during day, and it looks
much better if you come to work and have 5 unread messages than 250...
Yes, maybe I can split my time for real work time, and mail reading time,
but... my brain thinks that message which just arrived can change world
if not read within one minute ;-)
On other side, as I do not have digest now, I can also participate
in some discussions instead of only passively tracking digest and
answering only to bugreports in `my' subsystems... Maybe also
argument for not having digest...
                                Best regards,
