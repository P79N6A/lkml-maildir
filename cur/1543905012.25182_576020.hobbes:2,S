That doesn't sound like the best way to me at all.  Using two means
of buffering, one with preemption enabled and the other not, seems
complex and prone to error (perhaps not while you're working on it,
but later on).  We do already have that problem (the i_mmap_lock case
versus the others), but it's not a complication I'd want to extend.
The onstack array seems fine to me, even if you do end up deciding on
an array of one.  Is there any evidence that it's a problem getting a
page for the freeing (other than in circumstances that are already
badly slowed down)?  It's obvious that we need a fallback route,
but optimizing throughput on that route seems premature.
