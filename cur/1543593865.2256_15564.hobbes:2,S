Hi,
the problem changed a little bit with ac11. (I didn't try ac10)
apm --standby now actually goes to standby, but doesn't come back
anymore. (Well, it does not completely go down - the light
of my my brandnew USB-mouse does not go off.)
Mikael's patch makes it work, but my power/standby-button
still hardlocks. (same as with ac9)
