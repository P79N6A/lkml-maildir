Most of the traditional unices maintained a pool for each subsystem
(this is really useful when u have the memory to spare), so not matter
what they use memory only from their pool (and if needed peek outside),
but nobody else used the memory from the pool.
I have seen cases where, I have run out of physical memory on my system,
so I try to log in using the serial console, but since the serial driver
does get_free_page (this most likely fails) and the driver complains back.
So, I had suggested a while back that important subsystems should maintain
their own pool (it will take a new thread to discuss the right size of
each pool).
Why can't Linux follow the same approach? especially on systems with a lot
of memory.
