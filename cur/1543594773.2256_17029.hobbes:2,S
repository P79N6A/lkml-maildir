No, I haven't written any user space code for this at all, the only source is 
the patch itself.  The debug code might be helpful - show_buckets.  It's 
incomplete though, it only shows one level of the tree.  I need to do 
something about that.  I'll also spiff up my pseudocode and data structure 
documentation and forward it.
