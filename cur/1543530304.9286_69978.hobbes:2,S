Yes, I know - not an ideal situation really. Also largely unrelated to the

Yes - Unix philosophy always involves giving the user lots of rope, and
superuser near-infinite amounts...
This isn't what the original thread was about, though. I was talking about
circumstances where the system has run out of memory - at which point
processes try to allocate more, and fail. (Or, in suicide mode, they
succeed in allocating memory they then can't use...) We need to do
something pretty drastic at this point, otherwise more or less everything
is going to die in the immediate future.
