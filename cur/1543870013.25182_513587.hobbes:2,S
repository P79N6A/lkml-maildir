Sounds like a special case RCU system .. If you wanted to add this time
stamping system to Linux, the only acceptable way to add it, IMO, would
be to replace or extend gettimeofday .. You would also need a
justification for the changes, which right now is likely only LTT ..

update_wall_time, change_clocksource, __get_nsec_offset all hold the
xtime_lock w/ interrupts disabled.

I guess that's true.. You also have to assume that the upper 32 bits
have actually changed, the TSC is the only 64-bit clock in linux right
now..
