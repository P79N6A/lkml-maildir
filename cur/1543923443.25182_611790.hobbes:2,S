True but a task where current->audit_context == NULL is going to immediately
BUG out in audit_syscall_entry.  This is why the invocations of 
audit_syscall_entry() are conditional on current->audit_context.

No idea. How do you do it currently? HINT: current->audit_context == NULL
for these tasks.  If !audit_enabled, then audit_alloc() is not going to 
allocate an audit_context for the task.
I'm very curious how you think one of these tasks becomes auditable later
on once audit is re-enabled,  regardless of the value of TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT.
