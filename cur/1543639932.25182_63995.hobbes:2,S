Well, apart from the fact that you get into an endless loop with klogd, 
who wants to spew the kernel messages back to the console under some 
circumstances..
That said, I like the notion. I've always hated the fact that all the 
boot-time messages get lost, simply because syslogd hadn't started, and 
as a result things like fsck ran without any sign afterwards. The kernel 
log approach saves it all in one place.
But /dev/console just sounds potentially _too_ noisy.
