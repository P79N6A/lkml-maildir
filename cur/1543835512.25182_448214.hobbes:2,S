Not necessarily. AFAICS, the spam could be triggered by perfectly
legitimate activity. For instance, someone on the server may have
revoked your read permissions to the file, or may have deleted it.

It may be that other lurking issues were also triggering the printk. For
instance I know of a couple of corner cases in the krb5 privacy code
that could result in readpage failing. Those issues are being looked
into.
