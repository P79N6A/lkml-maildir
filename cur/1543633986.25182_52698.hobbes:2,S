As you're taking the effort of running some code to figure out the right 
ordering anyway, have you considered using the the information which is 
already there today, for all code which can be compiled modular.
For example, say I have the driver for the Fritz!PCI ISDN card. It depends 
on the protocol driver for passive cards (hisax) being already 
initialized, and hisax depends on the ISDN layer already being 
initialized.
If these three units are compiled modular, the right init order will be 
enforced by the fact that I can only load isdn.o, then hisax.o, then 
hisax_fcpcipnp.o in that order. That's because hisax.o needs
register_isdn() which is exported by isdn.o and hisax_fcpcipnp.o needs
register_hisax() which is exported by hisax.o.
And there's even a program which figures out the right order, that's 
modprobe/depmod.
That doesn't help for all the early internal init cases, but for the huge
fraction of modularized code, the info is there, though not taken
advantage of.
