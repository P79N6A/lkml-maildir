If you are using HIGHMEM, then the stock 2.4.20-rc1 has a known issue
with an unbalanced kmap. Marcelo has already applied the following
patch in the latest bitkeeper update.

#   We've uncovered yet another kmap imbalance in the new RPC code. This
# looks like it might be the last one (my debugging printks have been
# unable to unearth any more). One line fix + 4 line comment
# appended. Please apply to both 2.4.20-rc1 and 2.5.45...
