Hello Vojtech.
I have noticed that the ide-timings.h and ide_modules.h are running
much in aprallel in the purpose they serve. Are the any
chances you could dare to care about propagating the
fairly nice ide-timings.h stuff in favour of
ide_modules.h more.
BTW.> I think some stuff from ide-timings.h just belongs
as generic functions intro ide.c, and right now there is
nobody who you need to work from behind ;-).
So please feel free to do the changes you apparently desired
to do a long time ago...
