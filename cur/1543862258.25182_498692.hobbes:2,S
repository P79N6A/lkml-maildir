In retrospect I don't like the changes in behavior.  So my next
version will aim for closer to the original (non-containerfs)
behavior.

Ok - of course I suspect I'll have to just start coding away before
i can guess at what help I might need from your code.

That's one possibility, but imo somewhat unpalatable.
As I mentioned in the last email, I really like the idea of having
files representing each namespace under each namespace container
directory, creating a new container by linking some of those
namespace files, and entering containers by echoing the pathname
to the new container into /proc/$$/ns_container.  (either upon
the echo, or, I think preferably, upon a subsequent exec)
