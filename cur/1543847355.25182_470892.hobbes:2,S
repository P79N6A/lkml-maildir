Well, autosuspend for USB is on its way.  There are just a few bugs
remaining in my changes to ehci-hcd.  They should be ironed out soon and 
then Greg will merge it.
The existing sysfs power/state implementation isn't going away
immediately.  It is deprecated and scheduled for removal in July 2007.
