I just took a look at this, by setting up parport_pc, and yes I get noise.
This was my first sample with a kernel with APIC:
  7:      29230    IO-APIC-edge  parport0
Then I took a look again about 5 seconds later:
  7:      41560    IO-APIC-edge  parport0
And I looked again, and it was higher.  If you take a look repeatally, you see 
it increases for 2-3 seconds, then stops for 2-3, then starts increasing again 
and continues like this.  This is pretty much an idle system other than me
cat'ing.  I'm not using the parallel port at all.
Then I looked at the irq with parport_pc setup and with a kernel with APIC all 
disabled:
  7:          0          XT-PIC  parport0
And it is the same on repeated cat's.
These kernels are exactly the same except ones compiled with UP APIC and the 
other isn't.  I don't know how parport works, but seeing two different events
under this condition does seem suspicious.

I have no idea, but it is suspicious, as I get lockups and this noise with the 
APIC enabled kernel.
