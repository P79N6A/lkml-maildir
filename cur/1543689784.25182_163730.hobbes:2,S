Take a look at arch/i386/kernel/cpu/centaur.c, and CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE.
You can change the memory settings to weakly ordered writes, which
means that a plain write isn't suitable for spin_unlock.  Presumably
this mode is faster (though I don't see why, if Intel, AMD et al. can
manage good memory performance without weak writes).
