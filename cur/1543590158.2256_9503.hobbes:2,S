Hello,
      I recently compiled the 2.4.2 kernel on x86, 
and installed it. when booting off it, it fails to 
open the /dev/tty's and dumps the following messages..
=========================================
May  6 02:32:40 localhost /sbin/mingetty[786]:
/dev/tty4: No such file or direct

============================================
  Because of that, it is not able to get the keyboard
or the mouse.. and everything is hung. It does accept
the ctrl+alt+del to shutdown..
Another question which i wanted to ask was, how does
the new kernel know where to find the new compiled
modules in the /lib/modules directoy? I have my old
modules in /lib/modules/2.2.16, and my new modules 
under /lib/modules/2.4.2.  
Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
srimg.
