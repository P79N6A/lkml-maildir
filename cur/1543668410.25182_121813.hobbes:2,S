Hi,
We tried to reproduce the tests you've done with /dev/epoll and we've 
come to ask us some questions.
1. How did you managed httperf to perform more than 1024 connections 
when it's using select() ?
2. Did you get some errors like client-timeout or connections reset when 
you were doing your tests ?
3. How much time did a burst test ( 27000 connections and 2 calls per 
connection ) last and how many sample did httperf
    took during those tests.
Thanks a lot
