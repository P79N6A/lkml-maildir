Subject: [RFC]: block ptrace operations.

Is there any reason why the kernel does not in general support the block
ptrace operations (PTRACE_READDAATA, PTRACE_READTEXT, PTRACE_WRITEDATA,
PTRACE_WRITEEXT) ?
The major part of the code for implementing them is in the architecture
independent part of the kernel (kernel/ptrace.c ptrace_readdata(...),
ptrace_wrietdata(...)), yet the only platform which supports them as of
2.6.8.1 appears to be the SPARC.
Would patches to implement them on more platforms be likely to be
accepted ?
It seems weird to me that they're not already supported on more
platforms since they're compiling in most of the code they need !
