FYI, I just released a new version of libevent that supports
epoll and real-time signals in Linux; see
  
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/
The new version contains:
  - bug fixes in epoll and poll code (with help from brad at livejournal)
  - experimental support for real-time signals (due to taral)
  - change from 4-clause to 3-clause BSD-license
Feedback and comments appreciated.
Thanks,
 Niels.
