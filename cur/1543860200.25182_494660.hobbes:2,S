great!
I've got a security related question as well: vcpu_load() sets up a 
physical CPU's VM registers/state, and vcpu_put() drops that. But 
vcpu_put() only does a put_cpu() call - it does not tear down any VM 
state that has been loaded into the CPU. Is it guaranteed that (hostile) 
user-space cannot use that VM state in any unauthorized way? The state 
is still loaded while arbitrary tasks execute on the CPU. The next 
vcpu_load() will then override it, but the state lingers around forever.
The new x86 VM instructions: vmclear, vmlaunch, vmresume, vmptrld, 
vmread, vmwrite, vmxoff, vmxon are all privileged so i guess it should 
be mostly safe - i'm just wondering whether you thought about this 
attack angle.
ultimately we want to integrate VM state management into the scheduler 
and the context-switch lowlevel arch code, but right now CPU state 
management is done by the KVM 'driver' and there's nothing that isolates 
other tasks from possible side-effects of a loaded VMX/SVN state.
