I'm starting to *really* hate that bug.
My analysis was wrong, as I booted to modified 2.6.23-rc8-mm1 this
morning, that failed too. (Same error messages as -rc7-mm1 from the
first mail in this thread.)
So it's not that change that causes the breakage.
And I'm not really finding a good pattern to what boots fail and what work.
It seems to only fail, if I completely power off the system for
several hours. (Using the physical switch at the backside of the
powersupply, not the normal soft-off)
One of the five boots I tried yesterday, I also powered the system
completely off that way, but only leaving it off ~10..20 seconds
seemed not to trigger the bug.
But I still think that is not a hardware failure, as the -rc3-mm1
kernel never showed that error, even when I used it several times
after the first -rc4-mm1 failures.

Should I do this anyway?
I compared the dmesg form good and bad boots with -rc7-mm1 but could
not see any difference, so do you think that these additional
diagnostics could show a difference?
Or could you suggest any other debugging options I should try?
