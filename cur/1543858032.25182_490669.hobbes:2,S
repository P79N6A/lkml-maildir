Hmm, this is summary of broken linux-2.6.19.tar.bz2 file (used od and diff) 
offset 000000 -> 000b4f  zero cleared.
offset 000b50 -> 000fff  not broken
offset 001000 -> 001c47  zero cleared
offset 001c48 -> 001fff  not broken
offset 002000 -> 002d39  zero cleared
offset 002d40 -> 003fff  not broken.
offset 004000 -> 004f2f  zero cleared
offset 004f30 -> 004fff  not broken
offset 005000 -> 005a79  zero cleared
offset 005a80 -> 005fff  not broken
offset 006000 -> 006b7f  zero cleared
offset 006b80 -> 007fff  not broken
.......
 
All broken parts are always zero-cleared and start from offset 
aligned to 0x1000. (note: broken kernel's PAGE_SIZE is 16384)
I'll do AMAP.
