Hi,
currently I'm using kernel 2.6.18.1 on one of my computers. The router acts as 
an ipsec endpoint and masquerades all packets received via IPSEC.
Today I replaced the local ethernet interface by a bridged interface by 
combining the ethernet interface with a tap interface. I changed the 
interface names in my iptables-based firewall to match the new bridge 
interface name and did not change anything else.
Unfortunately, the kernel does not encrypt incoming packages any more. tcpdump 
reveals, that all received replies (I tested it with ping) are forwarded 
unencrypted, because they are visible on my firewall instead of being 
encrypted. Is this a known problem? Is bridging and IPSEC (maybe with 
masquerading) currently not supported? Or should I forward this issue to 
another mailing list? 
regards,
Jörg
