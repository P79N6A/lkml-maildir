If the hardware is known in advance, can you use some arch-specific 
thing (like rdtsc on intel) to get a timestamp that can then be 
calibrated by calling gettimeofday() at a lower frequency?
There will be issues (may have to use cpu affinity if the two don't run 
at the same rate, may need to disable any frequency stepping), but it 
might be possible to work around them.
