Subject: Disassembling a binary-only kernel module

Please CC me, as I'm not subscribed to the list.
I've got a binary-only kernel module for a box I own (PowerPC-based),
and I want to
disassemble the module but I don't know much about tools for linux for
doing this.
So, what I'm asking about is just a few pointers in which tools I should use for
the process.  (I've done a readelf for the initial insight on the module).
In advance, thanks!
