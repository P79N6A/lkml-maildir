Then either all or no DRM drivers should be enabled on x86_64, the
DRM_TDFX, DRM_R128, DRM_RADEON and DRM_SIS are not currently disabled. I
vote for enabling all drivers that work with 64-bit applications.
I wonder if this should be the first and only place where different
kernel/userland bitness causes problems. How has this been solved
elsewhere?
