Please try the attached patch. There appears to be a double free going on
in the scsi scan code. There is a direct call to scsi_free_queue and then
the following put_device calls the release function, which also frees
the queue.

bug is a LLDD's slave_alloc fails. Remove the redundant
scsi_free_queue.
