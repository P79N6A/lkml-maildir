Which increased stability, disabling ACPI, or disabling the IOAPIC?
Your box has MPS, so you should be able to use the IOAPIC in either mode.
Note that you can do these both independently at boot-time with "acpi=off"
and "noapic", respectively.
eg. 4 combos
1. <default - no boot params>
2. noapic
3. acpi=off
4. acpi=off noapic
you started with #1, and are running hard-coded #4 now, but skipped #2 and #3
