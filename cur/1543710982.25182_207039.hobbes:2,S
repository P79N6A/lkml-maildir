Ok, but bear in mind that although I can test that removing linux/irq.h
from netpoll.h fixes my problem, it really needs an x86 person to also
test it, just in case there's some dependency there that may not show
up for me.

Andi Kleen, hch and jgarzik are presently discussing the issue, and I
think they're convincing themselves that linux/irq.h is disgusting
mess.
As far as me doing anything with linux/irq.h, I think that's out of my
control because ARM doesn't use it - an x86 person needs to look into
fixing it properly.
So all I can do is moan each time this problem comes up until someone
gets pissed off enough to fix it properly.
