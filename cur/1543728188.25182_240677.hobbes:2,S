Ehm yes, aren't you contradicting yourself? Here's the mail I'm

Hi Joerg,
With 2.6 and SG_IO for generic block devices, it's pretty annoying and
confusing to users that cdrecord outputs:
"Open by 'devname' is unintentional and not supported."
This leads them to think they did something wrong, which they really
didn't. Any chance you could be talked into taking that message out?
--------
Nothing fruitful came of it, so patch stayed in the SUSE rpm.
