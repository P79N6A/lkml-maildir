First of all, the "problem" of an unset config variable in the .config 
is at most a cosmetical issue.
And even if it had been a real problem, discussing such an issue and 
convincing people why you consider it to be bad is always better, since 
whoever gets conviced in the situation will have learned for similar 
future cases.
There are ways how things should work and we should follow them.
As an example, there is one trivial x86_64 specific patch removing the 
small bloat caused by an unused export I made in -mm Andrew has 
forwarded at least twice to you.
Until now, I'd have considered it an unfriendly act to forward such a 
patch to Linus through my trivial tree bypassing you as the maintainer, 
but looking at your statement it seems to be OK for you if I send such 
trivial patches directly to Linus without bothering to go through you as 
the maintainer.
