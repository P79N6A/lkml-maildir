Subject: [PATCH] update to Sysrq Event Registration Patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've updated the sysrq event registration patches that I've got at:
http://bama.ua.edu/~dunna001/sysrq-register/
The update:
a) reworks the exposed table functions to be much cleaner, allowing for
	flexible and safe operation table manipulation.
b) ports the patch up to the test10-pre5 level.
Again, this patch provides a table based sysrq key event structure,
allowing code to register and unregister sysrq key events at run time,
and the functionality is exported to modules.
I've got an example module, but I've not yet written the changes to
Documentation/sysrq.txt necessary to fully describe the interface,
though it is pretty clear in the code.
the affected files are:
include/linux/sysrq.h
drivers/char/sysrq.c
kernel/ksyms.c
arch/i386/kernel/apm.c
