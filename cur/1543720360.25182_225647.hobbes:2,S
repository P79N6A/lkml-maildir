I have several Athlons (from the venerable 500 to the new XP 2600+) in
use at various sites, no problems. Among them an XP 1700+ in server use
with vanilla 2.4.26, rock solid.
Check you've used a supported compiler and binutils, then check the
hardware. Cooling (heat sink), RAM (try memtest86), power supply, proper
clock speed and core voltage, proper RAM timing -- these are all
contributing factors to instability if not carefully chosen and
installed.
