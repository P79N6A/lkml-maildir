Running a filesystem on top of iSCSI results in better performance
than NFS, especially if the NFS client conforms to the NFS standard
(=synchronous writes).
By searching the web search for the keywords NFS, iSCSI and
performance I found the following (6 years old) document:
http://www.technomagesinc.com/papers/ip_paper.html.
 A quote from the
conclusion:
    Our results, generated by running some of industry standard benchmarks,
    show that iSCSI significantly outperforms NFS for situations when
    performing streaming, database like accesses and small file transactions.
