hpa's p6nops test program works fine here on both a PII (family 6 model 3)
and a Pentium Pro (family 6 model 1 stepping 9).
I'm noticing another anomaly in jamal's /proc/cpuinfo above: since when
can a PII have sse and sse2? As far as I recall, it was the PIII that
added sse, and sse2 came with the P4.
