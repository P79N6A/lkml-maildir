I have the Intel 82371FB PIIX ISA-PCI bridge with two ide ports. The driver has
autodma configured. When attempting to set BM-DMA with hdparm, all of the disks
are bus master capable, I get the error:
HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted.
Under 2.0.36 BM-DMA was enabled.  Is this a bug? Is there a known work-around?
Is there a patch which allows triton.c from the 2.0. series to be used like
some of the specialized  drivers.
