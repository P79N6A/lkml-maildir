Read the patch comments for the patch adding that transition.  Briefly,
adding that transition to swsusp resume was a significant bugfix for
all drivers that rely on controller state to determine how to resume.
(That's mostly drivers that are intelligent about wakeup events... so
unless you're working with such drivers, the issue may be unclear.)

More like:  because swsusp overloaded the suspend()/resume() code paths
to do double duty.
Instead of just putting devices into low power states (just *which* state
is another discussion), they evolved into support for swsusp transitions...
causing trouble (and sometimes breakage) for non-swsusp models.

I suspect that after snapshot resume restart() should always be used.
That shouldn't be hard to understand at all.  It'd be sub-optimal in
the same cases today's system resume is sub-optimal:  devices that
were in low power states before system suspend wouldn't be that way
after system resume.

That comment was purely about existing practice ... and was mostly
about resume() processing, not suspend() paths.
It's an unfortunate reality that most device drivers are stupid in
terms of power management, so we need to be clear about just how
stupid they're allowed to be without being terminally broken.
Additionally, it would be a Good Thing if changes to clean up the
swsusp-related code paths didn't make "real suspend" more painful.

That actually gets into discussions from a while back about wanting
to be able to quiesce() devices, as separate from actually putting
them into low power states.
