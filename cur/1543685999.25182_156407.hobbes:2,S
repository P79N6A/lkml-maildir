It seems that there's a special case, where a task that was blocked on a read 
(either from a file or from swap) wants to be scheduled immediately, but with 
a really short timeslice.  I.E. give it the ability to submit another read 
and block on it immediately, but if a single jiffy goes by and it hasn't done 
it, it should go away.
This has nothing to do with the normal priority levels or being considered 
interactive or not.  As I said, a special case.  IO_UNBLOCKED_FLAG or some 
such.  Maybe unnecessary...
(Once again, the percentage of CPU time to devote to a task and the immediacy 
of scheduling that task are in opposition.  The "priority" abstraction is a 
bit too simple at times...)
