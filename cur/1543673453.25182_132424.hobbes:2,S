I tried 2.5.69-mm4 + your fblogo patch on my dual celeron.
It oopsed during boot. 
The machine has 384M RAM, it uses ext2 filessytems
on various scsi partitions, root is on a raid-0 device.
It is a nfsv3 server for another machine, I don't
think there were any nfs traffic when it crashed though.
The kernel uses preempt, devfs & framebuffer. 
Some scrolled off screen, this remained:
mempool_alloc
mempool_alloc
autoremove_wake_function
autoremove_wake_function
bio_alloc
mpage_alloc
do_mpage_readpage
radix_tree_insert
add_to_page_cache
mpage_readpages
ext2_get_block
read_pages
ext2_get_block
__alloc_pages
do_page_cache_readahead
filemap_populate
sys_remap_file_pages
do_mmap_pgoff
old_mmap
syscall_call
There were also a hex code listing at the end.
