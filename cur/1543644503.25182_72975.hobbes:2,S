By the way, I don't know how extensive your code reviewing 
of my changes has been.
This morning I sent you the complete driver patch from 2.5.38
to the latest version of the driver.  That contains all of
the changes I sent you last week, plus new ones.
Would it be better for me to send you incremental patches
in the future?  I could instead generate a patch relative to the
previous version of the driver I sent you.
Let me know what works better for you, based on where you are in code
reviewing.
Thanks!
