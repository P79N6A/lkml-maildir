Presumably the in-kernel metadata would need to be a superset of all of 
the different metadata stored by all the different supported filesystems.
It then needs two converters for each filesystem, to/from the metadata 
format. When you hit a new filesystem that your metadata doesn't 
support, you extend that metadata.
Of course, you're screwed if the new filesystem is sufficiently odd that 
it doesn't map nicely to the metadata organization.
