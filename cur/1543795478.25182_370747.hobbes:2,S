That's why it insists you rename it in order to run it.
I intend to fix that somewhat in a newer version of the sucker by having the 
script intercept signals and restore .config on the way out, but it can't be 
fully reliable (not against kill -9) because kconfig overwrites .config and 
the script is repeatedly running allnoconfig.  (I can probably bypass the 
makefile and feed it some strange command line argument, but what Kconfig to 
run it on gets us into architecture dependence issues the make file handles 
for us...)

You mentioned you set a lot of options. :)
I agree scripts/miniconfig.sh is clumsy.  I'm thinking about improvements 
(both to how it works and to the user interface), but I need to catch up on 
some other stuff first...
