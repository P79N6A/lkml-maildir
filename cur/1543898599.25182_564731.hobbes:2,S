I believe this is correct.  It probably would require requesting a gcc
builtin, which might be worthwhile to do if we

One could, though, use an indirect jump to achieve, if not as good, at
least most of the effect:
	movl	$<patchable>,<reg>
	jmp	*<reg>
Some x86 cores will be able to detect the movl...jmp forwarding, and
collapse it into a known branch target; however, on the ones that can't,
it might be worse, since one would have to rely on the indirect branch
predictor.
This would, however, provide infrastructure that could be combined with
a future gcc builtin.
