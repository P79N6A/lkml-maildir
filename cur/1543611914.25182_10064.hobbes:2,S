A specification which, according to its author, is incomplete.

N separate implementations means N dialects and N**2 compatibility problems.
Nicer just to have *one* parser, *one* compiler, and *one* service class that
supports several thin front-end layers, yes?  No?

I quote Linus at the 2.5 kernel summit: "Python is not an issue."
Unless and until he changes his mind about that, waving around this
kind of argument is likely to do your case more harm than good.
If you want to re-open the case for saving CML1, you'd be better off
demonstrating how CML1 can be used to (a) automatically do implied 
side-effects when a symbol is changed, (b) guarantee that the user
cannot generate a configuration that violates stated invariants, and 
(c) unify the configuration tree so that the equivalents of arch/*
files never suffer from lag or skew when an architecture-independent
feature is added to the kernel.
