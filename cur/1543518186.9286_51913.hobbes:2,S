Yup...  Not sure which TCP oddity you are talking about, but my experience 
is that user programs need timely execution to get best TCP performance.
If userspace doesn't get to run quickly enough, it is easy to trigger 
delayed acks by not getting data out of the operating system fast enough 
(at least with the BSD TCP implementation).  This can cause really poor 
performance.  We ran into this one in our HTTP/1.1 implementation, where, 
since we were doing much more work on a single TCP connection, we found 
it was essential to become very agressive in our user space code at getting 
data out of the socket buffers (or we'd end up with delayed acks).  In 
HTTP/1.0 using multiple TCP connections this was rarely a problem, but 
became essential to get things to really fly using HTTP/1.1.
