Please don't try to put such a fucked up include hierachy in.
Just move everything under include/xen or you will soon get
problems with the 80 line length limit for your includes..
Also please make sure that <xen/balloon.h> can be included unconditionally,
as we really don't like ifdefs around includes.

This doesn't not look like exactly smart cacheline alignment :)

What's a grant_ref_t?  Should this really be a typedef or better
a struct type?  Also it really wants a xen_ prefix instead of someting
so generic.

Did you talk to the networking folks about these problems?

Please use proper symbolic names for the ctal states and kill these
wrappers.

Any chance you could avoid these forward-prototypes by reordering
the functions a little?
Also a lot of these names are horribly generic.  A proper xennet_
prefix would probably help.

totally useless wrapper.

This looks like very wrong ordering to me.  unregister_netdev should
be the first thing in the remove function.

Can you replace these shouting macros with proper named functions?

This comment doesn't make any sense, __dev_alloc_skb is:
static inline struct sk_buff *__dev_alloc_skb(unsigned int length,
                                              gfp_t gfp_mask)
{
	struct sk_buff *skb = alloc_skb(length + NET_SKB_PAD, gfp_mask);
	if (likely(skb))
		skb_reserve(skb, NET_SKB_PAD);
	return skb;
}
then again what you really should be using here is __netdev_alloc_skb.

	This should be a noop for !CONFIG_XEN_BALLOON in the header,
	and there should be no need for ifdefs here.

Stuff like this won't compile anymore in the current tree.
