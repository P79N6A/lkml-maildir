With the current module refcount model I can only agree.
OTOH I need a sufficiently complex example, which gets the module locking 
right (file systems are just too simple), then I can actually produce a 
patch, which shows the advantages of a different model and the driver 
model/sysfs looks like an interesting victim. :)
