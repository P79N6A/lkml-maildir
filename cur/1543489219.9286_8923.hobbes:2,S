CMI8330 spdif is broken for sure. Reportedly fixed in the 8338 but then
noones shipping 8338 cards yet. The only ones so far seem to be reference
cards direct from cmedia.
Its also always a hack job since 8330/8338 cards usually dont come with
SPDIF connectors.
Also from what I understand the output is stucked at 44khz so DATheads
might have a problem with that.
