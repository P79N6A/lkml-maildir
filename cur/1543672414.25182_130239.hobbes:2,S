I don't see anybody sending the contents of the PALs, ASICs, and
other components on your motherboard. Modern machines have all
those bits loaded upon power-up. Before the power is applied,
the components aren't even connected. The same is true for
many disk drive boards, screen-card boards, etc. The manufacturer
will supply a bucket of bits, plus instructions on how to
load them into the hardware. I don't see how this violates either
the wording or the spirit of GPL. The manufacturer certainly
isn't going to supply the "source", which is the output of a
graphical program where the Engineers spent the last year
designing the board. If this kind of BS continues, Linux
will go the way of the Hippie culture.
Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
