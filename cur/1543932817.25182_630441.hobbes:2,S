We have actually been trying for over two years to get bugzilla fixed so
that it suits our email and list publishing workflow for fixing bugs.  I
surmise that 90% of our problems with bugzilla could be solved if it
simply tipped a SCSI bug report onto the SCSI list when it was created
in such a way that all replies were gathered back into bugzilla.
Unfortunately, no-one who maintains our bugzilla has actually been able
to make this happen.  The other 10% of the problem is that bugzilla
doesn't seem to have a way properly to integrate people who insist on
using its web interface to reply into the email flow.
