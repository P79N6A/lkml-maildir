This isn't what was reported before.  Maybe check inode 2162706 on
disk using xfs_db and make sure it looks OK?
As pointed out it is a really long call-chain --- I'm guessing it's OK
but it could still be a stack overflow problem as with 8K stacks you
don't have separate IRQ stacks.
If you like you could apply the following patch and *enable*
CONFIG_4KSTACKS.  In this case is badly named as you will really have
8K process stacks and 4K irq stacks after applying this.
