The main problem of sendfile() is that it exposes an incoming-fd 
'offset', which pretty much hardcodes the assumption that the incoming 
file is a pagecache-backed object. I believe the flush_fd solution to 
sys_splice() would solve that range of problems, and thus slice could be 
used for offset-less file objects too.
all the remaining problems of sendfile() just derive from this basic 
pagecache assumption that is hardcoded in the ABI. Once this one is 
overcome (and i believe fd_flush overcomes it), there's no reason why we 
couldnt implement the complete range of sys_splice() transfers.
