Hi Jeff, please apply:
Here's yet another batch of orinoco updates.  Smaller and less
significant than the last, this is basically a handful of remaining
small updates before tackling the big changes (wext v15, monitor and
scanning).  Patches are:
	orinoco-wstats-updates
		Updates and bugfixes to wireless stats handling
	orinoco-ignore-disconnect
		Add the ignore_disconnect module parameter
	orinoco-kill-dump-recs
		Remove ugly debugging code, to be replaced later with
		simpler and more useful stuff
	orinoco-no-infra-channel
		Don't attempt to set channel in managed mode, the
		firmware doesn't like that.
	orinoco-consolidate-allocate
		Remove some duplicated code for firmware buffer
		allocation, removing a bug in a hw workaround in the
		process.
