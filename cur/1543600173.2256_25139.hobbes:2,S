Hi,
Sorry if this is covered somewhere but I had a look last night (and asked
various people) but came up blank.
Is there a way to apply multiple patches to a source tree (if the patches
were produced from the same base tree)
The problem I have is thus,  I want to apply patch-2.4.9-ac6 (I guess might
as well do ac7 now) and the xfs patch
but both are from a vanilla 2-4-9.
Is there a standard way of doing this or is a `by hand solution`
(I managed to apply the ac first then the xfs (ignoring a couple of files
that are older in ac) but it was the config file that was messed up)
Its probably quite simple but I couldn't figure it
Cheers
Jeremy
