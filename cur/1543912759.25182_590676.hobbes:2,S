  I went for setting up a dummy listener in inetd, using tcpd, and
setting hosts.allow to specify myuser@ip.  Then a few while loops
spamming it with connections using nc.
  Anyway, on the old kernel that managed to trigger the BUG twice in
about 30 minutes.  I'm now on 2.6.22.6 plus your patch and coming up on
an hour (55+ mins) of the same and no sign of the BUG.
  So that looks like fixed to me.  I'll weigh in again if the daily
logcheck throws up another.
