[Scott, somehow I never received your original response so I'm
 replying based on what I saw in the linux.kernel newgroup...]

Sure, I don't see why not.  Here are the number I got:
TSO disabled:

This looks roughly like you'd expect: with TSO, slightly lower
throughput but much less CPU overhead.
With ftp, things get stranger: fetching a 2GByte file via ftp get
(from the remote end):
TSO disabled:
 ftp> get big.iso /dev/null
 local: /dev/null remote: big.iso
 200 PORT command successful.
 150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for 'big.iso' (2038628352 bytes).
 226 Transfer complete.
 2038628352 bytes received in 18.17 secs (109554.5 kB/s)
 ftp server CPU utilization: ~ 40%
With TSO enabled:
 ftp> get big.iso /dev/null
 local: /dev/null remote: big.iso
 200 PORT command successful.
 150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for 'big.iso' (2038628352 bytes).
 226 Transfer complete.
 2038628352 bytes received in 21.16 secs (94070.2 kB/s)
 ftp server CPU utilization: ~ 15%
So we get almost 15% of throughput drop.  This was with plain "netkit
fptd".  AFAIK, it does a simple read/write loop (not sendfile()).
