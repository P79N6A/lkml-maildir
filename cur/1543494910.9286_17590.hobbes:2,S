Is that "same results" WORSE or BETTER at thundering herd than without it?

While fixing apache to play nice with linux may be a good solution to the 
SPECWeb problem.  I think that this test, in general, reveals a critical flaw 
in the linux scheduler.  
I have seen the same kind of problem here with other programs that have a 
large number of running processes.  Linux slows to a crawl, and it is NOT
a result of swapping.  This is really a scalability issue.  If linux is
going to move beyond its current segment of the market, (low-cost servers),
these things have to be fixed. 
This problem will not go away with small tweaks, such as Richard Gooch's 
seperate real-time queue. 
They will buy some time, but it won't get rid of the real issue.  This linear
search is bad.  
Right now we are recalculating goodnesses again and again and again. 
Really, only a few values will change.  This is extra work that is a waste
of CPU time.  In an ideal world, we can find the next runnable process in
O(1), not O(runqueue len) time.
I've worked a little here with Greg Gaertner, who designed a scheduler for
Cray version of Unix, and we have come up with an alternate solution.   
However, it would involves a major rethinking of how linux scheduling works. 
(Priority is NOT stored as tick values, processes age as time goes on, realtime
processes don't age and have a high priority).   The current version limps, but
it doesn't fully work, or deal with SMP correctly.  It is basically an array of
linked lists that keep track of the current highest priority.   It can tell 
immediately what the next process to run is.  I'll present the proposed 
solution at LE, and hopefully, we'll be able to talk about it more then.
