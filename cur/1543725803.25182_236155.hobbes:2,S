If we hit a voluntary preemption point and there is no higher priority
process ready to run, it's a NOOP, the code just continues without
breaking any locks.  If there is a runnable higher priority process,
then you have to release all spin locks to become preemptible.  This is
handled on a case-by-case basis, depending on what you have locked and
why.  When Ingo talks about points in the code being 'latency-aware'
this usually means in practice that we are iterating over some list that
could be very large, so one way to deal with it is to break out of the
loop and release the spinlock after N iterations, where N has to be
determined by benchmarking latencies.
