I don't remember actual patches from a year ago. Current 2.4.x has code
that resets the via-rhine.
Since you run on 2.2 the drivers from www.scyld.com are an option (not
sure what the 2.4 status is on those). They are similar to the in-kernel
version but not identical. If you do test, any difference in behaviour is
intresting.

The 3c905C (3c59x) has been working just fine for me. But then so has the
