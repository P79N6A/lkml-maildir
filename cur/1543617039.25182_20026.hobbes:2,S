To clarify: This solution is being pushed by IBM.  Unless you have a FASt 
array, you may not get help making it work from either IBM or Qlogic.  You 
also need the 5.x qlogic driver which you can download from the IBM website 
(or from SuSE 7.3).

I've tested the qlogic and it will switch to the secondary and back again on a 
FASt 200 HA.
Although it was designed to work with the LSI Symplicity-4 AVT technology 
(which is what IBM FASt's OEM), there's a high degree of probability that it 
will also work with any array that the MD multipath driver also works for, so 
good luck.
