Subject: ARP restriction fix, patch rollup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a combination of patches to prevent 2.2.X kernels from sending ARP
replies when they shouldn't.  This set should be more clean than the original
patches.
+  *            Stephen D. Williams:    Prevent arp_send() from sending
+  *                                    responses when the indirect interface
+  *                                    involved has an inhibit (IFF_NOARP)
flag.
+  *              Axel Dunkel     :       fixes requests from local clients to
farm addresses.
+  *              Wensong Zhang   :       NOARP device (such as tunl) arp fix.
+  *            David Couture   :       Don't ARP when IIF_LOOPBACK.
This has now been extensively tested with linux-2.2.5-15 (RedHat 6.0).  It
should patch cleanly against 2.2.13+ but that has not been retested.
This is required to operate effectively in Direct Route (DR) mode with the
Linux Director patches and programs at
