ok, here is what I think are the reasons:
it's slow.
it's specific to PC-style RTCs in that it requires their wraparound and the
seconds register at a certain location (so for example several separate chunks
of NVRAM would be hard to integrate).
it requires rewriting the existing nvram driver(s ?)

last I looked you would not normally use sleep() in the kernel.

If you have a guaranteed wrapping behaviour, you can get all the (1<<n)+RTC_SECONDS
values at one time, making the routine take one second regardless of the NVRAM's
size.

You'd avoid the rather ugly assumption sleep(1) always makes your secound counter
increment while just looping until its value changes.  That way you could get your
routine to take .5 seconds on average.

It means you may not take a timer interrupt while you are waiting, which is not
exactly what I would call irrelevant.

I'm really waiting for your timer-interrupt-less kernel to run this code (the
chance it would not work is very slow, granted).

I am sorry, I just wanted to say I really don't know what undocumented
weirdnesses are in all the RTC chips around (and that I don't want to),
not that I actually know of any specific problems.
