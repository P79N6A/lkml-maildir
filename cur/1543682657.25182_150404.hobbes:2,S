Just wondering what kind of support for suspend/resume is "enough", say 
for video cards? Surely not the pci configuration space, you need to 
restore video mode, color maps, gfx engine state etc etc...what about 
frame buffer contents on card? Probably yes. Sounds like a lot of code, 
and different thing for every possible video card. Is there some general 
guidance here? Is drivers/video soon bloating with tons of 
suspend/resume code? I hope I am wrong :)
