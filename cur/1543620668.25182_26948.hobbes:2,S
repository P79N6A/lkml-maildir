That's the name of this script.

I haven't yet seen DSL devices that talk 100mbit, btw. But there might be.

I get a lot of email about this script and generally it requires some
tuning. Not all kbits are equal it appears. Some ISPs measure without ip
overhead, some with, other ISPs include PPP overhead, or PPPoA overhead, so
there is no general rule.
Whenever I deploy this script I spend some time tuning the UPLINK and
DOWNLINK values until I get the best results (maximum speed, but no
queueuing).
Good luck!
