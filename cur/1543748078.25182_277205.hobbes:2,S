Hi,

As a rule, Linux will be happier without it.
Why do you want to enable it?

Have you tried adding "usb-handoff" to your
kernel command line?  That was added specifically
to help work around BIOS bugs like those you've
run into ...

As a rule, if BIOS bugs affect XP I'd not be surprised
if to find them affecting Linux too.

That was interesting ... not directly related to USB,
looks like maybe the "legacy" support didn't work
very well either; maybe that's what the BIOS update
was solving.
