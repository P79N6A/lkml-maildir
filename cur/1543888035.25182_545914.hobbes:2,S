having this as a tristate makes no sense, that code can't be modular.
Also, there's a gratuitous whitespace change, and the default should
probably stay.
If there's consensus we should make this a user-visible option,
we can do that, though I still don't think this is any more
perfect than the other option that Daniel posted.
