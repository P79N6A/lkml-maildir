I was creating 18GB partitions a couple of weeks ago on a series of
non-RAID-controlled U2 disks. I got the exact same error (I have a
7890, the on-motherboard-equivalent of the 2940U2W) every time I tried
to build an ext2fs on one of the disks.
My disks are in removable cartridges, and for some reason, I moved
them around. It turned out that only in one of the cartridge bays were
there any problems. I tried flipping SCSI ID's. No effect.
Then, I replace the cable. Problems vanished.
So yes, ext2fs will do big partitions. i would recommend that you
check out each disk (and its connection) without RAID before drawing
further conclusions.
