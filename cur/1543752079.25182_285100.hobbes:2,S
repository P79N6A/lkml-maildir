That makes sense.
Sorry, SCHED_BATCH is unique to my tree at the moment so this is my 
mistake for not considering it. I'll have to transiently schedule 
SCHED_BATCH tasks as SCHED_NORMAL if we are going into swsusp. It's 
something I'll have to work on. In the interim, a workaround would be to 
convert all httpd threads to SCHED_NORMAL before shutting down in your 
scripts somewhere and convert them back after resuming.
Cheers,

P.S. Raj the --cutme-- thing in your email is very annoying for those of 
us who reply to up to 300 emails a day (and yes I do know why you do it, 
but if you keep doing it people will stop replying directly to you).
