That seems like a rather asinine idea to implement. I think you misread my 
question - there are some things that have to be done at the kernel level, such 
as when the entire memory has to be written, but are there portions of the 
existing code, or portions of Suspend2, that could be done in userspace?
If so, you could have a generic suspend mechanism in the kernel, and then 
various other things done in userspace.
