is_init() is very cheap. But if we send a signal and it is not ignored
we will wake up /sbin/init without good reason, just to complete unneded
do_signal(). Also, we may have a special setup so that this signal really
means something for init (and it has a handler for). In that case the
caller of kill(-1, sig) will be surprised.
Btw, de_thread() already takes care about multithread init, but
get_signal_to_deliver() does not:
	if (current == child_reaper(current))
		continue;
	// handle sig_kernel_stop()/sig_fatal()
This doesn't protect init from SIGKILL if we send it to sub-thread (and
this can happen even if we use kill(1, sig), not tkill). Yes, the main
thread will survive, but still this is not what we want. SIGSTOP will
manage to stop entire group because sub-thread sets ->group_stop_count.

I personally disagree, but this is matter of taste.
Ok, it was a cleanup only, let's forget it.
Still I don't like "p->pid > 1" check. And I don't think we need a new
helper (pid_leader or such) now. When we have multiple pid namespaces
we should rework kill(-1, sig) anyway. Right now this check means
"skip init", nothing more.
