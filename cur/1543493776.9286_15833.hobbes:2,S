So far so good,
I've tested doing a sync every 1 soecond (using watch -n 1 sync) while doing a commit on a VM where the REDO file was over 200M.
No Crash nor Hangs, therefore seem to be much better.
I'll keep you inform if I have the problem again, otherwise it's fine.
Thanks a lot and keep up the good works guys.
PS: Similar problems on NT would have taken months to get a fix!!!
Cheers
Andre
