It's very cosmetic but very annoying for P3 > 1GHz, where Linux <= 2.4.20-preX 
only reports 32 KB of cache and it also seems to ignore the "cachesize" 
parameter. Perhaps it really uses 256KB, but not sure.
I tested it in a Compaq Proliant 330ML-G2 (P3 1.4) and a kernel compilation is 
100% faster if the patch is applied.
