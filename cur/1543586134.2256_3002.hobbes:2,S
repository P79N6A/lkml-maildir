Yes, there is. It's a helper function used by procfs directory lookups.
If you need it - why on the Earth use procfs in the first place?
	* You have your own directory operations (since procfs ones
	  apparently don't satisfy your needs)
	* You have your own file operations (since procfs has none)
In other words, what the hell does your situation have to procfs (aside
of being a filesystem)?
So either comx.c is actually OK with procfs directories (in that case
it doesn't need proc_get_inode) _or_ it shouldn't use procfs in the
first place.
<Looking>
Uh-oh... rmdir /proc/comx/foo succeeds (and no, foo is non-empty) and
$DEITY help you if it happens in the middle of write() into something in
/proc/comx/foo. 'Cause write() will merrily access kfree'd data.
Oh, and read() will do the same.
Apparently comx.c uses mkdir /proc/comx/foo to register foo and rmdir -
to unregister it. Would be nice, except that resulting directory is
_not_ empty. And remove_proc_entry() doesn't abort method-in-progress,
so said rmdir() leads to interesting effects. Aside of the general
bogosity level of rmdir succeeding on non-empty directory. And no,
unlink doesn't work on /proc/comx/foo/*.
Who the hell had invented that API and could I have some of the stuff they
were smoking? 
OK, is there anyone who would know what userland stuff uses that horror?
It really looks like a API in bad need of being changed...
