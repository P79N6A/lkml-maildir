2.6.9-rc1-bk15 boots on both. The Acer x86_64 definitely has a bad CDROM 
as it's reading garbage for the vendor and  model.  The x86 box 
generates an Oops on mounting the cdrom, so I shall submit a bug against 
-bk15 for that - the nvidia driver 1.0-6111 for the FX5200 works without 
modding the driver source.

Sid.
