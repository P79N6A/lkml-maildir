If your goal is to simply push the network (and here I am assuming you are
just using nfs for that reason simply because it seemed easy to set up and
do), and using nfs to create an actual file on disk on the other side
isn't going to be fast enough, try using netcat instead.. no nfs.
You can have netcat listen on a socket at the receiving end and redirect
to /dev/null. It is initiated on the recieving end, thus /dev/null will be
referenced by that machine.
You then can connect to it on the sending end with netcat and source from
your /dev/zero.
I used to do this, and use 'time' to determine how long it took to move xx
bytes.
It's a quick and dirty really.. But works well for rough approximations.
