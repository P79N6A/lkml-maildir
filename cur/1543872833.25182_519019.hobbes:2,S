Not a solution, unfortunately, but try disabling CONFIG_IDE and using Alan's 
new PATA drivers. For your Intel systems, this should mean you need only:
CONFIG_ATA_PIIX
For both SATA and PATA support. You'll need the appropriate SCSI modules built 
in (if you say =y), i.e. SCSI disk and SCSI CDROM should be built in.
