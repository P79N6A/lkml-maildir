I agree, I thought about it too, but I didn't mention that since
theoretically 4:4 has a chance to start with a stack at 3G and to depend
on the userspace startup to relocate it at 4G ;). x86-64 does something
like that to guarantee 100% compatibility.

I think it's very fair to benchmark vsyscalls with 2.5:1.5 vs vsyscalls
with 4:4.
However remeber you said you want a generic kernel for 64G right? Not
all userspaces will use vsyscalls, and it's not just one app using
gettimeofday. As of today no production userspace uses vgettimeofday in
x86 yet. I mean, we can tell people to always use vsyscalls with the 4:4
kernel and it's acceptable, but it's not as generic as 2.5:1.5.

I read something about this issue. I agree it must be definitely marked.
apps may very well make assumptions about that space being empty below
128m and overwrite it with a mmap() (mmap will just silent overwrite),
and I'm unsure if we can claim that to be an userspace bug..., I guess
most people will blame the kernel ;)
Now that x86 is dying it probably don't worth to mark the binaries, the
few apps needing this should relocate the stack by hand and setup the
growsdown bitflag. plus they should lower mapped base by hand with the
/proc tweak like we do in 2.4.
I agree having the stack growsdown at 128 is the best for the db setup,
but I doubt we can make it generic and automatic for all apps. Also it's
not the stack really the problem in terms of genericity, infact with
recursive algos the stack may need to grow a lot, and having it at 128m
could segfault. As for mapped-base the space between 128 and 1G may as
well be assumpd empty by the apps, so relocation is possible on demand
by the app. I doubt we can do better than the above without taking risks ;)

thanks for the pointer.

Yes. I was sort of assuming that we would use the mapped-base tweak for
achieving that, the relocation of the stack is a good idea, and it's
doable all in userspace (though it's not generic/automatic).
thanks.
