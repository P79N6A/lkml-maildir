Hi Jeff,

What did you mean here?  Trim from where?
Currently I have about 2011 symbols in the source, and 2040 in pci_ids.h, 
with about 15 duplicates (likely the macro #define ones).  
The situation is like the donkey between the hay bales.
Which way?
In meantime I'll continue to document current practice here:

Thanks,
