Hi All,
I have recently moved to linux-2.6.28-rc7 but I am facing problem in
getting console on arm platform when booting through initrd.
On linux-2.6.27 system is working fine.
The problem is that it got hang after the init process started and
when control goes
to user space. The request for tty_open and tty_close keeps on coming.
Because of that the print stops coming on uart after init process.
Does anybody had any idea regarding this?
Regards
Sandeep
