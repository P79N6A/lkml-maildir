Hi! No resolution, I've been overloaded on a work related project.  The
best I can say is no problem noticed with 2.6.8.1, 2.6.10 works for smtp
code below but fails mplayer commands; 2.6.11 failed smtp code, didn't
test mplayer on 2.6.11 and haven't tried any newer kernels.
while read file; do mplayer $file ; done <mediafiles.txt # fails
for file in `cat mediafiles.txt`; do mplayer $file ; done # works
mplayer foo.mpg # works 
mplayer foo.mpg < mediafiles.txt # confuses binary for keboard input
This is the code that seems to fail per quote above, stdin is the smtp
DATA
tmp="${scq}/`safecat "${scq}/tmp" "${scq}" </dev/stdin`" \
        || { echo "Error $?"; exit 71; } # put the pipeline to disk, if possible
        # ${scq}/tmp is a temp for this function ${scq} is temp for this
        # program
score=`spamc -x -c <"$tmp"` # score it with spamd
sce=$?
I saw some notes on the new multi page pipes, me thinks its related but
that's all I know...
