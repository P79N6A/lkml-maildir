+				Userfs
+				~~~~~~
+
+So you are looking for userfs and wondering why there's no fs/userfs?
+Well, that's simple. Userfs went into kernel in 2.1.X time, but it was
+code-named coda.
+
+Kernel support for coda has nothing to do with networked
+filesystem. It is simple, file-based filesystem which depends on
+userland program (called Venus) to do networking. Therefore, if you
+kill venus and replace it with something else, you have almost perfect
+userfs.
+
+Kernel coda support has two weak spots:
+
+* its granularity is one file (which makes it pretty simple, but
+  renders it unusable for audiofs)
+
+* you can not have more different userland programs at same time
+  (which makes it impossible to use real coda and podfuk at same time)
+
+...anyway, it is enough for most uses. I have ftp, tar, zip (and many
+more) filesystems available in package called podfuk, available at
+
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/podfuk/podfuk.html,
 source is
+only 600 lines and is much simpler than venus.
