Questionable value of what? TSC or preemption?

I wouldn't want to disable preemption during udelays.
Either I would disable and enable preemption on every
pass through the loop. Or I would just manually check
for every pass if I should give up the CPU. This
obviously requires more computation for every pass,
but being a busy waiting loop I don't see a problem.
Otherwise I would lock the process to a fixed CPU for
the duration of udelay.

Do we have better alternatives for high resolution
time meassurements?
