Hi Dave,
Did you get time to write the above man page ? It will help to push
further patches in time (eg. for FA_PREALLOCATE mode).
The idea I had was to push the patch with bare minimum functionality
(FA_ALLOCATE and FA_DEALLOCATE modes) and parallely finalize on other
new mode(s) based on the man page you planned to provide.
Thanks!
