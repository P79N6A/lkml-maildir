OK, I'm taking this approach.

Done.

Done.

Done.  init_crc32() needs to be called from all drivers which call crc32()
or ether_crc_le().  I think I've got them added, but will verify and report
back after the weekend.  For the curious, I've got one big patch with crc32,
GPT, efivars, and uuid stuff (separates pretty easily into multiple patches,
but for review now, it's just one).
