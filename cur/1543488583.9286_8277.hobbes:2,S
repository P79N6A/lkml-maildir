 Let me explain: People can use DIPC to write a distributed program, and 
yes, they may even use shared memory locks (DIPC's documentation 
discourages people from doing such things, and proposes better ways). 
The application will run, even if it is slow. _IF_ the programmer thinks 
that he needs more speed-up, then he can start changing the application.
 BTW, nearly all OS text books mention that using memory locks in a 
user application is not a good idea, even in a single system. Semaphores 
are the "politically correct" mechanism for synchronization.
 Many of the current distributed applications were designed with the goal 
of getting as much speed up as possible. This is my belief (and hope) 
that system like DIPC will open the doors for other classes of 
distributed applications. Other than that, a DIPC program is 
multi-processor-ready, meaning that by targetting an MP architecture the 
programmer can get a distributed application for almost free.
 This is all about the way we think about computing. For me, people 
should optionally have a unifying software layer that not only hides 
things like I/O programming and memory managment, but also the existance 
of a network in the system. programmers can then decide if they want to 
use this high-level layer, or access the lower ones. Without the option, 
there is no choice.
 One can also think of a psychological reason as to why some people don't 
like concepts like DSM. Imagine you have been writing distributed apps 
for years "the hard way" (and getting payed very well for it). Now what 
happens if suddenly everybody can do about the same thing? Of course an 
expert assembly language programmer always has some advantages over 
someone who only uses JAVA, but hey, the JAVA programmer can do a lot of 
work, and finish the projects faster too! It is quite understandable if 
our imaginary assembly programmer starts bashing JAVA (and all other high 
level languages, for that matter) by labeling them "ineficient", "hiding 
the reall way the hardware works (flawed?)", etc.
 Now, other branches of Computer Science moved on from such discussions a 
long time ago, because people needed easier programming models. But 
since distributed programming is still the realm of a selected few, this 
branch has to struggle with such issues today.
