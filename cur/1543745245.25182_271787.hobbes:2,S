My reading of the specs is that read() damn-well never throw
away anything that hasn't been read yet. If it does, then
it's a bug. That said, the bug may never be fixed because
(1) people may deny it's a bug, or (2) programs may rely
on it.
FYI, it the first condition, I've seen these kinds of bugs
mysteriously fixed later on even though many people denied they
were bugs.
I suggest you supply a big enough buffer to read the hole thing
and then tear it apart at the application level.
Cheers,
