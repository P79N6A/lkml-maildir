you come across your limit and new allocations will fail.
BUT! IMPORTANT!
in real life use case with OpenVZ we allow sharing not that much data across containers:
vmas mapped as private, i.e. glibc and other libraries .data section
(and .code if it is writable). So if you use the same glibc and other executables
in the containers then your are charged only a fraction of phys memory used by it.
This kind of sharing is not that huge (<< memory limits usually),
so the situation you described is not a problem
in real life (at least for OpenVZ).
> Plus, are you billing by vma or address_space?
not sure what you mean. we charge pages. first by whole vma.
but as page gets more used by other containers your usage decreases.
Thanks,
Kirill
