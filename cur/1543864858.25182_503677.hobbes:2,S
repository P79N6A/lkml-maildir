I have had the same thought...
Just because Windows (and a bunch of clueless firmware writers) does
something wrong shouldn't mean that we do it too.  The fact is, these
devices are in violation of the appropriate SCSI and USB specifications.
Ignoring the residue value can actually lead to undiscovered errors.  
According to the spec, it's perfectly legal for a device to return an
error indication there and nowhere else.
