i'm pleased to announce the v2.6.21.4-rt10 kernel, which can be 
downloaded from the usual place:
     
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
more info about the -rt patchset can be found in the RT wiki:
     
http://rt.wiki.kernel.org
This is a fixes-only release assembled by Thomas Gleixner again. On 
popular request this -rt tree is against the stable dot kernel - i.e. 
apply it to a v2.6.21.4 tree, not a v2.6.21 tree.
-rt10 includes the futex fixes and the latest hrtimer updates from 
Thomas Gleixner, latency tracer fixes from Carsten Emde, tasklet fix 
from John Stultz, rcu tasklet -> softirq conversion and the 
enable-irqs-in-pagefaults fix from Steven Rostedt, and other, smaller 
fixes.
to build a 2.6.21.4-rt10 tree, the following patches should be applied:
   
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.21.4.tar.bz2
