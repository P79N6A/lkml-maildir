If you can manage to have a CVS repository that is always updated to the 
minute with full history info etc. then this should be suficient to satisfy 
all needs.  Public CVS repositories are common enough so people should know 
how to use them already.
The best would be a few of those scattered around the world so things do
scale.  It shouldn't be that much bandwidth for bkbits.net to update them
all automatically for example.
