linux/Documentation/modules.txt says that I should find my modules in
"linux/modules" after running "make modules". However, this is
apparently not true as I see no modules directory. 
I am trying to compile a kernel with lots of modules for a machine
without a network connection. To move the kernel, I simply copy it to
floppy and move it over to the other machine. However, for the modules,
is my only choice appears to be "make modules-install" then tar up
/lib/modules/kernel-release/ and then remove the directory. Is there a 
cleaner way to handle this?
