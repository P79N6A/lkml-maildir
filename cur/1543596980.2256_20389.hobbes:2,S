I have replaced all the memory with fresh 4x512MB REGISTRED ECC RAM,
and it has been running stable for 8 days now. I also replaced the
SCSI cables. 2.4 is not an option.

I am not really sure. How do I find out?

Sorry, I am not going to risk bringing down the database with your
program. Its to critical for our business. (The database contains all
stock quotes for Oslo, Stockholm, Frankfurt, NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ
stock exchanges and they are updated 24/7. I can only bring it down in
weekends, and only if it really important.)
However I have access to a few other dual boxen. (2x550, 2x350, 2x166
and a dual SparcStation 20). I can run your program on them with stock
2.2.19 SMP if you want me to.
