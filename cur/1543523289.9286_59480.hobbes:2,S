Hi all,
	I want to given Indian language support for Linux. Currently there is not 
ISO series for Indian language, but in unicode character code set, Indian 
Language (Devenagari) ranges from U+0900 to U+097f. Can any one tell me how 
to go about or give me pointer where i can get more information.
	We cannot map Unicode Devenagari character to ISO's 8 bit representation 
because, character code can occupy positions 160-255 in ISO which is not 
sufficient for Devenagari characters.
Thanks in advance.
Santhosh.
