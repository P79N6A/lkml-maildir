Yeap, I like the clean up.  Just a few comments.
* s/if(/if (/
* The patch adds a number of trailing white spaces.  I suggest using git
or quilt for patch management.  They complain when they see such things.
I'm still not so sure about NCQ FUA.  I still think that separate opcode
for FUA ops is the right thing to do (tm), well, or the safer thing to
do (tm).  Regarding drives which support NCQ but not separate opcode for
FUA, unless many drives are like that, I don't think the loss is too
great.  Also, I'm more uncomfortable with trusting those drives doing
NCQ FUA properly.
Let's talk about this on the other thread.
Thanks.
