How can it be of any use then? You _still_ have an omnipotent root account
that can be broken into, or whose processes can be hijacked? Capabilities
aren't about "taking away", they are abount granting specific rights.
OK, if the status of the "capabilities in ELF" suggestion is that it only
takes away rights, the case is definitely closed for me.
