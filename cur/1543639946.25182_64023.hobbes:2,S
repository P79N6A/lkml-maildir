I haven't looked at the current source yet, but the PCI access code
used to work this way: if both BIOS and direct access were enabled
(which was the default) and both worked, BIOS was used only for getting
information about interrupt routing and last bus number and direct
access for everything else. Hence the problematic BIOS calls were used
only if there were no other possibility or the user explicitly told
us to.
				Have a nice fortnight
