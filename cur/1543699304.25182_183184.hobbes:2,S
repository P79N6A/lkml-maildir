No, the pci core calls the release() function in the pci driver that is
bound to that device.  It waits for that release() call to return before
continuing on.  You can sleep for however long you want in that
function, but once you return from there, the pci structures for that
device will be cleaned up.

Not true.

Hm, this could be easily tested by sleeping until usb_host_release() is
called when you unregister a device.  The i2c, pcmcia, and network
subsytems do this.  I think we now have a helper function in the driver
core to do this for us, so we don't have to declare our own completion
variable...

That's what my proposal 1 paragraph up would do.  If I get the chance
this afternoon, I'll try to implement it if no one beats me to it...
