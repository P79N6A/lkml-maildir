Oh, that.
Well, there is no locking when retrieving a pte atomically from the page 
table. In do_swap_cache we figure out the page from the pte, lock the page 
and then check that the pte has not changed. If it has changed then we 
redo the fault. If the pte is still the same then we know that the page 
was stable in the sense that it is still mapped the same way. So it was 
not freed.
This applies to all pages handled by do_swap_page().
The differences are:
1. A migration entry does not take the tree_lock in lookup_swap_cache().
2. The migration thread will restore the regular pte before 
   dropping the page lock.
So after we succeed with the page lock we know that the pte has been 
changed. The fault will be redone with the regular pte.
