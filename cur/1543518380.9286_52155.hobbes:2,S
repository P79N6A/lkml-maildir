Most directories appear with size 0 or 4096, some with 2048 and a few with
sizes like 12288, 20480, 229376, etc. Those numbers doesn't seem to be
related to the number of files in the directories nor to the amount of
data stored in them.

I can set up a test partition if it is of any use. Symptoms under Linux
were that I couldn't create files larger than one block: they got
truncated, but the created block had correct data int it.
I'll try to see if I can find something wrong in the code.
