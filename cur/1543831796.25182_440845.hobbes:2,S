That might be unnecessarily paranoid, a zero would be legal only with 64K
block size and then only in the first record of the block.
How about this wrapper, with associated struct field name change?
unsigned ext3_entry_len(struct ext3_dir_entry_2 *de)
{
	return (le16_to_cpu(de->entry_len) ? : (1 << 16);
}
Storing will just work.  In search_dirblock we don't even get extra code
because there is already a special check for zero that goes away.

Daniel
