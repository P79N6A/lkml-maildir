I've applied this patch, but "pccard" keeps oopsing. The test kernel is
a 2.5.69-mm5 with the "i8259-shutdown.patch" reverted, plus the above
patch and your previous "verbose" patch. Attached to this message is the
new "dmesg" from this patched kernel.
As I told Andrew, reverting "make-KOBJ_NAME-match-BUS_ID_SIZE.patch"
solves the oops.
