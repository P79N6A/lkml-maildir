Subject: [PATCH] r8169: revert 7da97ec96a0934319c7fbedd3d38baf533e20640 (partly)
Various symptoms depending on the .config options:
- the card stops working after some (short) time
- the card does not work at all
- the card disappears (nothing in lspci/dmesg)
A real power-off is needed to recover the card.
