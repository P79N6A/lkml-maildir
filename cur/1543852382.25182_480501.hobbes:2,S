You can't tell that CPUs behave exactly probabilistically --- it may 
happen that one gets out of the wait loop always too late.
SMP buses have complex protocols to prevent starvation in case all CPUs 
are writing to the same cache line and similar --- however it is unusable 
againt spinlock starvation.

Scheduler increases priority of sleeping process, so starving process 
should be waken up first. But if there are so many processes, that process 
that passed the semaphore, sleeps and tries to take the semaphore has 
already increased priority to the level of process that waited on the 
semaphor, livelock can happen too.
