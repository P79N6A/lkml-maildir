I have exactly the same board and the same symptoms: I have a Realtek
Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8029(AS) (using the NE2000-PCI driver). I
always get the 'pci=autoirq' error message from the card when booting but
it took some time until I noticed it because the card works without any
problems. I get the same error message in 2.4.0-ac1 with the VIA IDE
driver upgraded to v3.6 . I don't have module support in my kernels.
