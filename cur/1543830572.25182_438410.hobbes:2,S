Hi, I'm having troubles when using the vmalloc kernel parameter.
My grub config looks as shown below. If I set vmalloc to anything
bigger than 128M (the default) then the kernel will not boot and it
will log the following on the console:
VFS: Cannot open root device "LABEL=/" or unknown-block(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel Panic - not syncing: VFS Unable to mount root fs on
unknown-block(0,0)
If I specify 128M or less then the kernel will boot just fine and
/proc/meminfo will show the effect in VmallocTotal.
Any hint on what I'm crashing with?
thanks,
  Rodrigo
ps: my kernel version is 2.6.15.2, and my machine is a dual opteron
with 2GB of ram
title with vmalloc
         root (hd0,0)
         kernel /boot/vmlinuz ro root=LABEL=/ vmalloc=256M
         initrd /boot/initrd.img
