I've got hundreds of those during several weeks, and in different boots.
It seems the kernel starts spitting them right after using cdrom.
I wasn't the one who used cdrom, so it is possible, that the person in
question had been able to eject the cd without unmounting it first. I'll
check if the door locking on that device works.
But you are certain that the oops was eventually caused by these and not
by any bug in vm?
