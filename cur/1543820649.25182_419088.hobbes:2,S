It seems clear that this particular oops was caused by the xfs driver 
trying to register a cpu_notifier at a time when that notifier chain was 
expected to be completely idle.
Instead of moving all this code and data out of the init sections, 
wouldn't it be better to fix the individual drivers (like xfs) so they 
won't try to use inaccessible notifier chains?
For that matter, if lots of entries on the cpu_notifier chain are marked 
with __cpuinit, then shouldn't the chain header itself plus 
register_cpu_notifier and unregister_cpu_notifier be marked the same way?
