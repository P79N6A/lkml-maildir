This is the approach that I suggested to you, Paul, at OLS after your talk.
Again, if you go about this path then you might think about extending the
scheduler to have an additional parameter regarding a preemption threshold
instead of doing this stuff indirectly with priority manipulations like
the above. It was something that I was considering when I was doing my
Linux kernel preemption project to fix the problems with RCU-ed read side
thread migrating to another CPU.
If folks go down this discussion track, it's going to open a can of
scheduling worms with possiblities (threshold, priority, irq-thread
priority, global run queue for SCHED_FIFO tasks) pushing into global run
queue logic stuff. It's a bit spooky for the Linux kernel. Some of the
thread migration pinning stuff with per CPU locks was rejected by Linus
way back.

I'm not sure how folks feel about putting something like that in the
scheduler path since it's such a specialized cases. Some of the scheduler
folks might come out against this.

I'm not understanding what you exactly mean by tickless idle systems.
Are you talking about isolating a CPU for SCHED_FIFO and friends tasks
only as in the CPU reservation stuff but with ticks off in many proprietary
RTOSes ? Don't mean to be tangental here, I just need clarification.
