I think it makes sense to keep d_inode in the first part of the dentry
always, because it is by far the most referenced field in the dentry,
along with the critical fields from prune_dcache(), shrink_dcache_anon(),
dget(), dput(), d_lookup().
While not totally accurate in terms of runtime frequency of use, the counts
in the code:
          fs/*.[ch] fs/*/*.[ch] size32 size64 prune_dc shrk_dc_anon d_lookup
d_inode	        384        2131      4      8
d_lock          104         529      4      4       1       2
d_count          18          66      4      4       1       2
d_lru            18          18      4_     8       1       1
d_hash           37         154      4      8_              2          1
d_name           73         908     12_    16                          1
d_flags          26         104      4      4       2
d_mounted         7           7      4      4
d_parent         40         231      4      8_                         2
d_op             37         269      4      8
d_rcu/d_child  3+22        3+45      8     16
The '_' are potential cacheline boundaries.
