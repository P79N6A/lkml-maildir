Hi Chris,
  That is a perfectly reasonable request, but unfortunately I do not
have any at this time.  Its currently all based on the observation that
pull_rt_tasks() can cause excessive rq->lock contention and the theory
that this should reduce the cases where that happens.  It still needs to
be proven and quantified, outside of the basic litmus test I gave it
before posting.
I will try to get to this ASAP.
Regards,
-Greg
