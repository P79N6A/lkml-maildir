I have only had problems in X, that is what I ment. I have not
had any console problems, but I do not use the console that much
(if ever lately) I use xterms && vi or write a simple gui hack
in gtk or tk

since it is only one interrupt on my machine so far I see not
reason to punish them all by using noapic<g>

isn't X the the only program that access hardware 'directly' as

are all handled by the kernel, but X access the video card
directly? I do know that it is handled differently than most
other hardware, but am not sure exactly how.

I did look at some of the kernel code arch/i386/kernel/time.c 
the code in there had comments that said that it should be
cleaned up so I am not sure if it ever was. It had mentioned how
the clock was getting the time and seemed to hint that it was a
hack and not a good way of doing things.

   basically starting my  X server I still get an _X11 Trans
Socket or something, I'd have to look at the xserver.log to get
the exact message but it had "Could not connect to x server"
then X starts. It seems that X 'hickups' then starts or actually
that when x tries the first time to start it cannot and then the
second try it does, although I am not sure why.
   Actually this was a RH6.0 problem that they posted updated X
rpms for. It originally caused X to crash, but they fixed it. I
am not sure it was a problem with X and xfs, per say, just some
compile option or something that RH had done when they built X
for RH6.0. I cannot remeber all the details but I am  sure it is
still there at their bugzilla site.
   If you'd like to look at my X log I can send it to you so you
can see the exact message.

again timing.. one cpu is out of sync with the other.
Maybe it has something to do with the fact that when you are
using XT-PIC the CPU is handling an interrupt like it was a UP
machine. 
On an SMP machine when that warp occurs you are throwing off
your timing. 
->Think of a motorcycle my harley. There is a timing system.
When that timing system is off the motorcycle runs funny and
sounds funny, but when the timing system is correct it runs
smooth. This is especially true in the case of a harley. In a
harley the pistons do not fire at 180 degrees of each other but
rather one right after each other boom boom. That is what gives
them there unique noise. If the timing is off just slightly then
the Harley does not run properly, and you can tell
->In a SMP system the interrupts are fielded one after another
boom boom. (Assuming that the apic handles 1 interrupt at a
time) If the timing is off you get boom..nothing..boom. misfire?
now in X the mouse is the active process doing a mouse move.
Yes/No? 
However when one of these cpus is off the interrupt may get
'delayed' and the other cpus gets executed. misfire, if the
timing stays off you may have continuous misfireing or bezerko
mouse.
I this scenerio any delays in an split interrupt can put
movements of the mouse out of wack. If the timing stays off or
jumps around then interrupts can be out of the order. (yes no?)
I had originally heard some people say that they had there mouse
come back after 10 minutes or so, if they left there system
alone. Maybe the timing got out of wack and was able to correct
itself.
I have not had keyboard trouble like you have. Just the mouse. 
Also last night I noticed some strange behavior while running
kde. upon logging out of kde (if you have not used kde then you
go to menu then logout) the mouse freezes on the left side of my
screen, and then as the window manager starts to shutdown it
brings the logout prompt window in the center of the screen, and
restores mouse control. I guess this would mean that X and the
wm control the mouse? No other wm I use does that thou.

but at some point the kernel passes this off to the hardware and
says do this. if there is a delay in doing this and the other
cpu gets to do that then?

hmm maybe if the timing problem can be corrected and done right

Or both.
I thought that NFS mounts were having a similar problem which
were interrupt related?

I am going to throw some printk's out there and turn on debug,
and see what happens.
