Ok, this is the important change. I will patch my 2.2.5 kernel (when 
I get it compiled ;-) and try it out.

We should do the same thing for non-Intel x86 processors, since I 
believe they will work the same. We have both Cyrix 6x86 and K6/K6-2 
systems here so I can test all of the above and see how they react to 
the PCD and PWT bits. I hope they work in the same manner...

Right, the code in the kernel that implements the mmio_remapnocached 
should be changed to set both the PCD and PWT bits to ensure the same 
effect. Normally the MTRR's are never set up to cover PCI memory 
regions for anything but graphics framebuffers (and also I have 
discovered that if the 'Prefetchable' bit in the PCI base address 
register is not set, the MTRR's don't appear to have any effect 
either, but this could also be something that the chipset is doing to 
disable caching directly).
