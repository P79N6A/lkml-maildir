Well, perhaps that's a difference between xntpd and ntpd - I am
using the latter, version 4.1.0, from Debian testing. Manpage
doesn't mention RTC, ntpdc doesn't seem to find it. I may
well be out of sync with ntpd (pun fully intended) as I haven't
looked at it for a while, but...

... you are assuming that the RTC doesn't get adjusted first (to
match the system clock)!

I thought the original poster was claiming that the /kernel/
wrote to the RTC, which would explain the behaviour I'm seeing.
An alternative explanation I suppose is simply that nothing
is writing to the RTC (not ntpd, not anything) except for
the final clock command as the machine shuts down. Very simply
the symptom is that both clocks are correct, I suspend the
machine (without APM in the kernel), I resume it, reboot
it, and now both clocks are wrong.

OK I will go read the manpage even harder.
