I think what John means, and what Jamie has also brought up in a 
separate note is that now when an event happens on an fd, in some cases
there are tests for 3 kinds of callbacks that get triggered -- the wait
queue for poll type registrations, the fasync list for sigio, and the
new epoll file send notify type callbacks. There is a little overhead
(not sure if significant) for each kind of test ...

Adding persistent iocb support to aio doesn't appear too hard, and 
to be fair to aio, it does seem to help it come much closer to epoll, 
in fact very much closer at least for pipetest with a quickly hacked 
version that I tried. There still appears to be a gap remaining to 
be covered i.e epoll continuing to lead :) albeit by a smaller margin.
A little more magic is going on than just interest registration 
amortization (and I suspect its not just the threading argument), 
worth analysing if not for any other reason but to gain a better 
understanding of these 2 event delivery mechanisms the core for both
of which are now in the mainline kernel.
