This is perfectly normal. It was outevolved and ran out of people who
cared enough to continue it. Happens all the time. In the proprietary
world its normally one company putting another out of business and lots
of people losing jobs and money so its actually a good deal friendlier
this side of the fence
When you contribute to a big project some of your stuff will get nowhere,
other stuff will eventually get kicked out and replaced. Its part of the
progress of the system.
And yes one day the Linux kernel will probably go the same was as EVMS
when something cooler and neater replaces it.
