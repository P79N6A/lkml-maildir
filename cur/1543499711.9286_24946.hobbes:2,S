Of course, that's why I like the fact that the #define is hidden
somewhere in the sourcecode.

Just SCSI, but 3 ext2 and 2 fat filesystems. So I can be sure the
hasnfn isn't specialized on one fs type.

Bonnie might be good for several purposes but not for testing that
hashfn. Ok, here are the results anyway:

It's hard to get a good snapshot of the bucketsizes.
And here's the kernel-build bench:

Really boring...
>your tests suggest fixing the shift value at 6,
Yes, and I have a theory why this is a good thing:
Look at what a shift value of 6 actually does: it produces a gap of one
block every 64 blocks. So basically 64 blocks occupy a space of 65
buckets.
At this point I have to define 'skew'.
What is 'skew'? When reading/writing blocks linearly the original
hashfn uses each bucket every 'hashsize' blocks. A shifting hashfn
steps a little faster through the hash table, so after 'hashsize'
blocks it is already 'skew' buckets in the next run.
A >>bh_hash_bits hashfn has a constant skew of 1 while the skew of a
fixed-shift hashfn increases with the hash table size.
What's the best skew? There are two contradicting criteria.
1. A small skew increases the total cycle length of the hashfn.
2. A big skew helps putting consecutive blocks of consecutive runs into
   their own bucket.
A fixed shift value of 6 results in a small skew relative to the
hashzize (1/64) and in a big skew in absolute numbers. With small hash
tables the total cycle length is the important thing. Small hash tables
have a small skew and thus a relatively long cycle. With bigger hash
tables the cycle length as well as the skew increase, so both cycle
length and skew are strictly improved. If I can show that the >>6
hashfn works for small hash tables it automatically means it works even
better for bigger hash table sizes. I tested >>6 with 4096, 8192,
16384, 32768 and 65536 buckets.
>have you examined the goodness of the page cache hash function?
No, that's a different game.
