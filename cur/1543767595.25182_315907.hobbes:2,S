I think it's unreasonable to *prohibit* fork-after-registration; for one
thing, there's lots of code that forks under the covers.  Setuid helpers
like getpty just assume that they're going to be able to fork.  Even
stuff like get*by*(3) can potentially fork.  And with site-configured
stuff like PAM, you end up with things that work on the developer's
system but break in deployment.
I think it's exceedingly reasonable to say "RDMA doesn't work in
children".  But the child should get a sane memory image:  at least
zeros in fully-registered pages, and preferably copies of
partially-registered pages.  Differentiating between fully-registered
and partially-registered pages avoids (I think) the pathological case of
having to copy a GB of data just to system("/bin/ls > /tmp/tmpfile").
You can still go pathological if you've partially-registered gigabytes
of address space (for example a linked list where each node is allocated
with malloc and then registered) but that's a case of "Well, don't do
that then".
Rather than replacing the fully-registered pages with pages of zeros,
you could simply unmap them.
A consistent statement would be
    After fork(2), any regions which were registered are UNDEFINED.
    Region boundaries are byte-accurate; a registration can cover just
    part of a page, in which case the non-registered part of the page
    has normal fork COW semantics.
Probably the most sane solution is to simply unmap the fully-registered
pages at fork time, and copy any partially-registered pages.  But the
statement above does not require this.

Obviously, calling *any* RDMA-userland-stuff in the child is completely
undefined [1].  One place where I can see a potential problem is in
atexit()-type handlers registered by the RDMA library.  Since those
aren't performance-critical they can and should do sanity checks with
getpid() and/or checking with the kernel driver.
[1] You might want to allow the child to start a completely new RDMA
    context, but I don't see that as necessary.
