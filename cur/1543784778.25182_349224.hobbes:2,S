But my point was that we already have a mechanism for coping with this:
The scsi template parameterises some of these things (max sector size,
sg table elements, clustering, etc).  For less standard things it
doesn't cover the driver uses the blk_ adjustors directly from
slave_alloc/slave_configure (This is currently how USB and firewire
communicate their alignment requirements).
By wrappering both the template and the slave_alloc/slave_configure
methods in the SAS class and not providing the driver access, it can't
use existing methods to make any adjustments that may be necessary.
