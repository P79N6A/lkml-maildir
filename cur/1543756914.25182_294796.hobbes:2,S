    You can change this value using the configuration, namely
CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT. The value you store here is used to determine
LOG_BUF_LEN=2^CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT. You seem to have '14' as the
value of CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT. Increase it to 16 and you will have 4
times the current length for the dmesg buffer.
    I'm assuming you're using a more or less recent 2.4.x kernel. I
suppose that the same is applicable to 2.6.x kernels.
