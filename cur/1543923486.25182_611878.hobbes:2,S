Sorry, I lost the original to reply to, but stumbled on this thread
looking for something else.  :)
Anyway, from the assertion:
Assertion failed: (char *)sfep - (char *)sfp == dp->i_d.di_size, file:
fs/xfs/xfs_dir2_sf.c, line: 647 kernel BUG at fs/xfs/support/debug.c:82!
this is almost certainly a result of xfs_dir2_sf_off_t,
xfs_dir2_sf_hdr_t, and/or xfs_dir2_sf_entry_t or others not being
"properly" aligned on arm.
There was a patch floating around to "fix" it but it's not on-disk
compatible w/ x86 & friends, it just makes things consistent for arm.  I
think packing some of these structures would take care of it, but this
problem could use some attention & testing I think, it's been floating
around a long time.
