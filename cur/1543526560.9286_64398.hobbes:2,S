Well, as long as you are using the current raid code, it's not a problem
--- the raid-0.90 drivers will autodetect raid partitions at boot time
and will find all of the live mirrors regardless of their device names.
They then use the information in the raid superblocks to reestablish the
correct /dev/md* devices without any need to consult /etc/raidtab at
all, so they guarantee a constant device name for you without any fstab
or devfs trickery required at all.
Cheers,
 Stephen
