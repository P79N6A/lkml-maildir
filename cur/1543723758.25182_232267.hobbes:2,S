No, the code (ide-geometry.c) is gone.

Andries pointed it many times but you seem to completely ignore it
(see comments in ide-geometry.c):
 * I did this, but it doesn't work - there is no reasonable way to find the
 * correspondence between the BIOS numbering of the disks and the Linux
 * numbering. -aeb
 *
 * The code below is bad. One of the problems is that drives 1 and 2
 * may be SCSI disks (even when IDE disks are present), so that
 * the geometry we read here from BIOS is attributed to the wrong disks.
 * Consequently, also the former "drive->present = 1" below was a mistake.
 *
 * Eventually the entire routine below should be removed.
I also pointed out that IDE driver _doesn't_ need BIOS geometry et all.

Yep.

Yes, it won't help.
We need new ioctl for a get_start_sect() (first sector of a partition).

We can restore ide-geometry.c or try to return values obtained from
EDD code through IDE driver.  Alternatively we can add new ioctl for
start of partition and remove HDIO_GETGEO from IDE driver completely
but probably it is too late for this for 2.6 (we should do it early
in 2.7 then).  Andries?
