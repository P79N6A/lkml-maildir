OK that's a good data point. It would be really good to be able to
do an analysis on your overnight IO patterns and the corresponding
memory reclaim behaviour and see why things are getting evicted.
Not that swap prefetching isn't a good solution for this situation,
but the fact that things are getting swapped out for you also means
that mapped files and possibly important pagecache and dentries are
being flushed out, which we might be able to avoid.
Thanks,
Nick
