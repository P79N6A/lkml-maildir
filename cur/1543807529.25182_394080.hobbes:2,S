Out of curiosity, what commands does hal send the drive that can 
interrupt burning?  I've been reading the MMC-5 standard lately and it 
looks like while the drive is burning, attempts to send it other 
commands that would interfere with the burn are supposed to be failed 
with an error code indicating that a burn is in progress, and thus, 
avoid making a coaster.
