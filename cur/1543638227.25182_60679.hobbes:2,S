Actually, I'm thinking of a much simple scenario: basically any two
devices on the same channel, both with pending requests on the queue.
This could be a hard drive and a cd writer, for instance. If you have 60
requests pending for the hard drive, queue gets unplugged, you start the
first one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but now you pass back the drive to
the request handler when the first request completes, and you select a
new request from that very same drive without considering device
starvation? Any run of the cd writer queue would do nothing, since it
would just find the channel busy.
This sort of thing cannot be solved at the block layer. The two queues
are independent seen from that layer, the channel-busy dependency cannot
be solved there.
