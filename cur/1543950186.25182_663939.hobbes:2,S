For some value of "require". The code will do what it's supposed to do anyway, just in a sub-optimal way (it will avoid a deep sleep even though it didn't need to).

But I don't use jiffies in the idle exit path, only the entry path.

Which basically leaves this option. I.e. guarantee that jiffies are updated between one cpuidle reflect and the subsequent select.

Now you're just being a smart-ass. :)
