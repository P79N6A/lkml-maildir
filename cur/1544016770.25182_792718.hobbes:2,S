Hmm, the exact same command on my work tree produces nothing.  If I generate
a whole new tip/cpus4096 tree, it's then there.  Once again a victim of 
git remote updating - not!  There must be something that I'm doing wrong:
Non-working tree:
 21> git-describe
v2.6.29-rc1-19-g92296c6
 22> git-status
# On branch cpus4096
# Your branch is behind 'tip/cpus4096' by 233 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
 23> git-remote update
Updating linus
Updating tip

New (working) tree:
 2> git-describe
v2.6.29-rc1-252-g5cd7376
???
