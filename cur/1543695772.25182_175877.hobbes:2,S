IF (and that is a big IF) the cpu knows about the change, there is code in 2.6 
to change the scaling of the TSC to match what the hardware is doing.
If you really want stability on the x86 grab the HRT patch (see sig below) and 
set it up to use the pm-timer.  This is rock solid, but does add time to the 
gettimeofday() and friends as it requires an I/O cycle to read it.
