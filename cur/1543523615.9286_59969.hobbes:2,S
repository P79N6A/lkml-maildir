Okay.

This will be changing in the near future :) The problem is first the lack
of docs to write a framebuffer device. I wrote a HOWTO about this but it
needs some more work. I need to add a section on PLL clocks since this is
part most people don't understand. The second is the API is somewhat ugly
with all the extra console handling code in it. It is being slowly
cleaned up in 2.3.X. I hope this clenaup will make driver writing simple
and my HOWTO help guide the newbie.
