hi,
i am allocating some 1000 bytes of memory as folows
f_malloc()
{
     .....
     for (i=1 to 10)
     {
     size = 1000;
     pAddr[i] = (unsigned long) kmalloc(size, GFP_DMA | GFP_BUFFER);
     }
     ...
}
and freeing the allocated memory as follows
f_free()
{
     .....
     for (i=1 to 10)
     {
     kfree(pAddr[i]);
     }
}
pAddr is defined as 'unsigned long pAddr[10]'
But when f_free executes i ran into problems and computer hangs.
What can be the problem?????
regards,
daljeet.
