The thing about it, is that he seems to be complaining about *HIS OWN*
bugs!  If he relies on system calls having semantics any other than
the one specified in the POSIX standard, his code is either
fundamentally broken, or he needs it very clearly documented.  He
seems to be relying on "well, BSD behaved this way in the past" and
then blames Linux when his assumptions fall apart.
