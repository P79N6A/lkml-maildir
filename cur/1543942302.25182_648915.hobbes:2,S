Subject: [patch] usb net: asix does not really need 10/100mbit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The asix usb driver currently depends on NET_ETHERNET which means you cannot
enable this driver if you only have 1000mbit enabled in your kernel.  Since
there is no real dependency between the NET_ETHERNET portion and the asix
driver, simply drop it.
