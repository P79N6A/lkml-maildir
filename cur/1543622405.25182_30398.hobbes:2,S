Note that teh IO _completion_ can happen in user land. That does not mean 
that the IO page tear-down can (or should) happen at the same time.
There are two issues here:
 - the data structures supporting the IO, built up and torn down from 
   process space.
 - the IO itself.
One is synchronous, the other is not.
