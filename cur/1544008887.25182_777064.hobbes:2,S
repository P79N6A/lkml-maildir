Maybe I misread your driver... in the multi-descriptor memcpy case it
is perfectly fine to set the ack-bit in the driver for all but the
last descriptor in the chain.  The client is only expected to attach
dependencies at the end of the chain.

You can lose it for all but the last descriptor.

If you will never need to run async_memcpy and don't want to handle
the bit then you could set DMA_PRIVATE and the channels would never be
picked up by the async_tx api.  But, I am not convinced we need to
take that step yet.
