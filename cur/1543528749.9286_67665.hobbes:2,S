Sure, but this is a completely different scenario ! If you change the
directory (chdir), you can obviously get a different result.
Again, POSIX ANSI/IEEE Std 1003.1 (2nd ed., 1996-07-12), section 2.3.6,
page 32, 2nd paragraph:
"The special filename, dot, refers to the directory specified by its
 predecessor."
In the  cd /foo; mount /foo; stat bar; stat ./bar  case, both stats
should return the same result, because the refer to the same directory.
Note that I'm not advocating that they should also equal  stat /foo/bar
(which would be more like your example).
