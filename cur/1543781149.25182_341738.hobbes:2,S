  This is IDE ABRT error and it indicates that something strange is 
going on.  You're not getting this kind of error on VIA controller, right?

  Wow, this is CRC error.  Something is wrong w/ your controller.

  30 secs is SCSI command timeout and retrying w/ one less chunk is sd 
driver's error recovery behavior.
  It seems that a lot of errors occur while bits are going through your 
SATA connection.  I don't know about Seagate drives, but my Samsung 
drive sometimes locks up if it gets weird packets/commands.  This might 
be also your case.  PHY-resetting usually gets the drive back online but 
currently libata doesn't do any such error recovery actions.  To make 
sure that it's because of faulty controller, can you please try the 
following?
  * Monitor how IO goes on the drive in Windows.  You can do this by
      - Start->Run and enter perfmon.
      - After perfmon starts, right click on (heh heh, I guess this is
        one of those few times you read this on linux kernel mailing
        list) counter list and select add. Add DiskBytes/sec counter of
        PhysicalDisk object.
      - Adjust scale to 0.0000010.  Also, change color to black to make
        it stand out.
      - start dd.
  I think, if the errors are due to hardware error, the perfmon graph 
will show some stuttering when it hits command timeout.  So, write to 
disk, as writing seems to cause timeouts.  If the problem also happens 
on Windows, it's highly likely that you have a faulty controller.
