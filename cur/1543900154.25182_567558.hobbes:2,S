That's no longer the case (doesn't need to be enforced actually) now
with being able to add logging targets _after_ the module has loaded
and initialized / registered itself. It's plausible a user may simply
want to load netconsole without any "netconsole=" option, and then
specify/add targets later -- this wasn't possible previously, of course.

The above is applicable for the built-in case too, with
CONFIG_NETCONSOLE_DYNAMIC. So now built-in netconsole will initialize
(configfs subsystem, etc) and register itself (register_console) even
if no "netconsole=" was provided, again for the same reason.
And I now notice that CONFIG_NETCONSOLE=y in the defconfig's of
most arch's. So I think I did get the common case wrong there ...
ok, I'll get rid of the unlikely() in that case.
