If security issues were not a concern, you save the last PID, freed at
_exit() and use that immediately. If it's already used, it's zeroed.
exit() just stuffs the exit() PID into the variable, overwriting any
previous, including zero. It needs to be handled under a lock, but
it gets a quick return on investment for the usual fork() exec() stuff
that interactive users use.
