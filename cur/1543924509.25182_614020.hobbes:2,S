Would it not be as simple as looking at the BIOS provided topology
information? If nr sockets > 4 assume multiple board.
Of course one could run a multi board solution and not utilize all
sockets, in which case the heuristic would fail, but I guess buying such
an expensive solution and then not sticking in the cpus is rather rare.
