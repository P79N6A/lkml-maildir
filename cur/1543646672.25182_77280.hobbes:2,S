After patch did a soft reboot and got a kernel oops.
I took a pic of it, but did a lousy job, so deciphering it is tricky - here's
what I can be sure is correct:
Mounting local filesystems:  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00001124
*pde = 00000000
Oops: 0000
ide-scsi scsi_mod rtc

 <0>Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
I'll save the pic in case you need the register or stack values
