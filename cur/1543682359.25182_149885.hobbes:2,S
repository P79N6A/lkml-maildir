Well, it's not exactly fast and it takes quite some CPU cycles on my
side. However, that's a spare box (HP-PARISC B132L+, 132 MHz) which
doesn't have to do anything else:)

That's quite good:) Are file renames also represented as patches (ie.
one file gets removed, another one is added)?
To draw the line, that's exactly what one could wish. It someone isn't
happy with the format, it seems to be easily Perl'ed/sed'ed/...
I've not yet looked at any other trees than the linux-2.5^H6 tree, but
I'm currently spending some time to work on merging some trees to one
(read: I want to merge all the non-i386 linux ports) and that involves
quite some scripting / SCMing and up to now, I've not found the
Super-SCM to achieve that:) Tasks are to get all ports to current 2.6.x,
distribute their patches among them and pushing it (separated in small
pieces) to Linus at some far future...
If I could get perfect patches like that out of bkbits.net (at least for
the projects hosted there), that could potentially ease the task a lot:)

PPS: I'm missing quite a lot of informations there - if you're a port
maintainer, please get in contact with me:)
