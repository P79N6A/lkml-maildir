Right, but as I understand it, the cluster size *minimum* is the block
size; that's why I made reference to block size - 16k blocks would have
64 inodes per cluster, minimum, potentially all locked in these paths.
Just saying that today, larger blocks -> larger clusters -> more locks.
Even though MAX_LOCK_DEPTH of 40 may not accomodate these scenarios, at
least it would accomodate the most common case today...
Peter, unless there is some other reason to do so, changing xfs
performance behavior simply to satisfy lockdep limitations* doesn't seem
like the best plan.
I suppose one slightly flakey option would be for xfs to see whether
lockdep is enabled and adjust cluster size based on MAX_LOCK_DEPTH... on
the argument that lockdep is likely used in debugging kernels where
sheer performance is less important... but, that sounds pretty flakey to me.

*and I don't mean that in a pejorative sense; just the fact that some
max depth must be chosen - the literal "limitation."
