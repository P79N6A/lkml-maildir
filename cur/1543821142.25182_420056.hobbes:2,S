This REALLY needs fixing. If it weren't so late right now I might have written
a filter that takes a tarball and sanitizes the permissions. I've got
good reasons
for compiling the kernel as root (when in the make, install, reboot, test loop
it's quite a timesaver).
Yes, I'm the guy who keeps trying to log in as root on ftp.kernel.org over ftp
with no password. For some bone-headed reason I keep thinking the default
username for ftp is anonymous, not the user's.
