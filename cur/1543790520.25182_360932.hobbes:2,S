Ingo, I wasn't aware that tasks are bouncing around wildly; does
your patch improve things? Then by definition it must penalise
workloads where the pairings are more predictable?
I would prefer to try fixing wake balancing before giving up and
turning it off for busy CPUs.

It doesn't always migrate though. That's the point of all the heuristics.

wrong. There is no way you can "prove" that a migration is beneficial!

Ken mentioned it was worth 2%. Not a bad improvement, but if our
performance "sucks" then it sounds like we need to look elsewhere.

No doubt that if it is doing pointless migrations that your patch
prevents, then that will improve performance here. However I'd rather
try to fix the actual balancing code.
Without any form of wake balancing, then a multiprocessor system will
tend to have a completely random distribution of tasks over CPUs over
time. I prefer to add a driver so it is not completely random for
amenable workloads.
