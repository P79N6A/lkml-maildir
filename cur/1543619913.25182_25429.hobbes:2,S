If I'm reading Poller_sigio::waitForEvents correctly, the rtsig stuff at
least tries to return a list of which sockets have become ready, and your
implementation falls back to some other interface when the signal queue
overflows.  It also seems to extract what state the socket's in at that
point.
If that's true, I confess I can't quite see your point even still.  Once
the event is generated, ircd should read or write as much as it can, then
not pay any attention to the socket until readiness is again signaled by
the generation of an event.  Sorry if I'm being dense here...
