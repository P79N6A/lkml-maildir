  That would not be NFS. NFS is stateless: the server neither knows nor
  cares what the clients are caching.
  
  Feel free to invent your own protocol, but beware that the sort of
  thing you're proposing will most likely place a very heavy burden on
  both the server and your network.

Slightly off-point, but..
I remember there was an nfs hack whereby you could have different
files going to different clients from the same nfs volume based on an
extension of the filename. eg something like:
ls on the server of nfs export:
size 2242  file1:-client1
size 3091  file1:-client2
ls from client1:
size 2242 file1
ls from client2:
size3091 file1
ie, the server exports different file1's to different clients based
on the extension. 
I remember reading about this somewhere in the linux/Documentation
directory a long time ago. But I can't find back anymore now, just
when it'd be useful to me.
Anybody remember this feature? and whether it still exists?
