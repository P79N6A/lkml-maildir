I do not know what you exactly mean with this phrase, but it sounds a 
bit odd. This is a problem just related to Fedora. After i read the 
comments you posted (thanks for that), i assume that it is also related 
to Ubuntu, Gentoo, OpenSuSE and any other distribution using 2.6.15 as 
default kernel for the installation.
Or did i misunderstand you in this point?

Nope. I added the option 'nofb' to the parameters i already mentioned in 
my last message. But the problem still exists, no change so far.
