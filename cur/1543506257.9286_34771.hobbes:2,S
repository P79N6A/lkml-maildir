I like the idea of an automoderator bot - the first time and only
the first time you send a message to lk, it bounces the message and
requires that you send it a unique cookie in the subject line.
After that you are in the white list. Current subscribers are 
auto-whitelisted.
No manual intervention required, and you don't have to be a subscriber
to LK to post.
