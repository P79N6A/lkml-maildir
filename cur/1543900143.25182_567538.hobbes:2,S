Ext4 can still load/read ext3 fs (which by default with 128 bytes old
inode size, means doens't have support nanosecond timestamps), so it's
not always gurantee nanosecond timestamps granularity.(it depends on the
size of the inode (>128 bytes), by default, a fresh ext4  increase inode
size to 256 bytes to have the room to store nanoseond timestamps, inode
versioning etc)
