I believe the low bit set in the dma_status means that the DMA transfer 
is still in progress.  Since the timer has expired, that means it's been 
in progress for 10 seconds.  Odds are the drive has stopped responding. 
 Since it's a Western Digital drive, it probably needs to be powercycled 
to come back.
I don't think this is a problem with the controller card, but I could be 
wrong.
