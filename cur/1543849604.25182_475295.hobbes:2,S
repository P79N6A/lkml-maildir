Ah OK, and there is my misunderstanding with cpusets. From the
documentation it appears as though cpu_exclusive cpusets are
made in order to do the partitioning thing.
If you always have other domains overlapping them (regardless
that it is a parent), then what actual use does cpu_exclusive
flag have?
