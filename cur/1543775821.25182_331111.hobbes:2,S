This problem will continue. Eventually there will be no general
exported symbols. The apparent idea is to prevent the use of the
kernel in proprietary systems.
Not to worry. The tools provided with a typical Linux distribution
are capable of resolving those symbols. You can make a script
that `greps`  System.map for the correct offsets of those symbols.
You can use those offsets in a linker script.
