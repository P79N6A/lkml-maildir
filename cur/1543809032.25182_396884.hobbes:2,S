Odd, the original stuff I noticed talked about Linux PM in general,
and specifically why STR deserves a heck of a lot more attention than
it's been getting so far ... not just systems with rotating media.
(Too much attention on rotating media means that really low power
systems have been getting a bit shortchanged in Linux.)

No, not "AFAIK" ... since when I told you explicitly that was untrue,
you then ignored that statement.  And didn't look at the specs that
I pointed you towards, which provide the details.  (USB 2.0 spec re
hubs; and of course the Linux-USB hub driver ... www.usb.org)
The events that a hub receives say pretty exactly what happened.
You should know that already, since USB behaves that way even
when the system is _not_ suspended ... 
The full mechanism for USB is more like wakeup signaling on USB triggering
hub wakeup (possibly cascading through a few layers of external hub), at
some point triggering root hub wakeup, which maps to a PME# signal.  That
relies on no more than VBUS being powered at a fraction of a milliAmpere,
and the equivalent of a pair of voltage comparators triggering wakeup when
USB signaling changes from J to K states for something like 10 msec.

Did you read about the PME# signal in the PCI PM spec?  www.pci-sig.com
Maybe you could try that. 
Also the ACPI spec ... the early chapters give a decent overview of the
different components of that model.  (ISTR two chapters try that, with
the second being more to-the-point despite some duplicated graphics.)
