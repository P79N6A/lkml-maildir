I'm pleased to announce new acrypto release.
It now supports nice scatterlist walkers, usage can be found in
async_provider.c [bridge to the sync API].
By design acrypto provides whole scatterlists array to the
driver so it can optimize it's processing.
This is _probably_ the last release, due to starting asynchronous
development based on top of existing SW/TFM crypto stack,
but work is not completely stopped, it just goes into the shadow.
As usual, archive is available at
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/archive/acrypto
Acrypto page can be found at
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/?section=projects&item=acrypto
Archive contains acrypto subsystem itself, driver for HIFN 795x cards, 
driver for SuperCrypt CE99C003B chip, driver for VIA padlock engine, 
port of the existing HW RNG for AMD/Intel/VIA to acrypto,
asynchronous crypto provider based on SW stack for AES, and 
asynchronous IPsec support for in-kernel IPsec engine and it's 
binding to acrypto.
