could you please try those iodepth=20000 tests with the latest 
fio-testing branch of fio as well? Jens wrote a new, smarter syslet 
plugin for FIO. You'll need the v3 syslet kernel plus:
 git-clone git://git.kernel.dk/data/git/fio.git
 cd fio
 git-checkout syslet-testing
my expectation is that it should behave better with iodepth=20000 
(although i havent tried that yet).
