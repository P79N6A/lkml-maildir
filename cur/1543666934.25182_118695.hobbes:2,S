Same box committed seppuku overnight, this time in a different way.
There's lots of "slab error in cache_alloc_debugcheck_after()"
warnings. cache reiser_inode_cache memory after object was overwritten
Some call traces.
 check_poison_obj <- kmem_cache_alloc <- reierfs_alloc_inode <-
 reiserfs_alloc_inode <- alloc_inode <- get_new_inode <-
 reiserfs_init_locked <- reiserfs_find_actor <- reiserfs_iget <-
 reiserfs_find_actor <- reiserfs_init_locked_inode <- reiserfs_lookup <-
 real_lookup <- do_lookup <- link_path_walk <- kmem_cache_alloc <-
 __user_walk <- vfs_lstat <- sys_lstat64 <- syscall_call
Slab corruption: start=c70c7044, expend=c70c7213 problemat=c70c7044
Last user: [<c0280dcb>](reiserfs_alloc_inode+0x1b/0x30)
Data: (lots of hex)
I'll give that box a run of memtest to rule out memory corruption
problems. I'll also hook up a serial terminal tonight to catch tomorrow
nights 'activity' in full 8-)
