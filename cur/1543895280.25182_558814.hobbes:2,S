Yes, but the license of the license of the software is/can be a
completely different thing then the license of the software itself.
And the GPL doesn't fit well for normal literature anyways - otherwise
we wouldn't have the Creative-Commons project.

The copyright holders of the software can change the license if they
wish/decide. The situation that a very large number of people are
necessary for this in the case "Linux kernel" doesn't change the
theoretical possibility.
