Here's a patch adding kobjects to this infrastructure (I didn't use a
new CONFIG option, which it probably should be.)
Does this look correct?  I can't tell if this is going to catch
anything, as my trees all seem to have these kinds of bugs worked out
now, as we are already catching a number of these types of things
already with kobjects.
Should I be doing more checks?  Different things based on the state of
the object?
thanks,

I think this is right, but it's hard to tell...
