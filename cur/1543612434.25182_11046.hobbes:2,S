I'm not sure what the point is.  We've already agreed that the multiple OS
instances will have synchonization to do for file operations, ftruncate
being one of them.
I thought the question was how N user processes do locking and my answer
stands: exactly like they'd do it on an SMP, with mutex_enter()/exit() on
some portion of the mapped file.  The mapped file is just a chunk of cache
coherent memory.
