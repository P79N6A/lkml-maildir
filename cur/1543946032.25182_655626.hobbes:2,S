Btw., if people have problems with rejects from trivial patches, the 
'mpatch' tool does wonders in resolving the easy ones:
  
http://oss.oracle.com/~mason/mpatch/
when you get a .rej file, first check whether mpatch can resolve it 
conflict-free:
  mpatch -d kernel/somefile.c.rej
if there are no conflicts then:
  mpatch -a kernel/somefile.c.rej
quilt refresh, review the result and it's done in the majority of cases.
