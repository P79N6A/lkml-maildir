Subject: [PATCH 2.6.17-rc6 0/9] Kernel memory leak detector 0.7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is a new version (0.7) of the kernel memory leak detector. See
the Documentation/kmemleak.txt file for a more detailed
description. The patches are downloadable from (the bundled patch or
the series):
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/patch-2.6.17-rc6-kmemleak-0.7.bz2
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/patches-kmemleak-0.7.tar.bz2
What's new in this version:
- different configuration options added for tweaking kmemleak
- reduced the length of time running with interrupts disabled (the
  interrupts are now only disabled for individual memory block
  scanning rather than for the whole memory)
- fixed bug in the memleak_seq_* functions (pointer structure accessed
  after freeing)
- more false positives ignored
To do:
- more testing
- more investigation into the task stacks scanning
- NUMA support
- (support for ioremap tracking)
Many thanks to Michal Piotrowski for stress-testing kmemleak and
reporting various issues.
