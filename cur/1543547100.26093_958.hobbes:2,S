Hello,
I had a kernel panic with 2.2.16 yesterday. Because of this rare 
occasion, I immediately checked my RAM (memtest86), but the RAM is OK, 
there was no thunderstorm, no handy (mobile phone) nearby, the CPU and 
RAM not overclocked, all chipsets Genuine Intel. I only have two memory 
chips from China, but that should be close enough to Taiwan ;-)
Maybe it helps for reproduction: After Boot the system did a periodic 
fsck, the I installed a program, thereby changing CDs twice. 
Immediately after installation the system behaved odd and the panic 
came along.
And yes, I've been running that kernel on that machine before without 
problems. Only kswapd seemed instable in 2.2.16. My machine, a P100, 
has 64MB RAM.
The syslog (2.5kB) with surrounding messages is attached.
Regards,
Ulrich
P.S. The library issue is probably due to SuSE-7.0.
