I missed the first message in this thread, so if I am off base, please
just ignore my post.
I had a problem, somewhere aroudn 2.1.125, where my ppp interface would
not go away.  This was a problem on my one machine, where I had it
dialing in once an hour to set the time.  The answer was, that I had
been using kill -9 to stop it, but by reading the manpage for pppd, I
found that I should be using kill -2.  Hope this helps.
