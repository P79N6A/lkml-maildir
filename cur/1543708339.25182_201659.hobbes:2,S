I think we have a bug in the inline function. Actually this behavior is 
consistent with the IA-32, which says "if the contents source operand
are 0, 
the contents of the destination operand is undefined." So the code in
32-bit 
also has a bug there. Today it is set to zero fortunately, and the code 
happens to be working.
