If the destination address changes, your window is much smaller, because
a new peer ID is assigned. E.g. with 2.3.40, roughly 1.5% of the IP IDs
repeat after 1000 packets or less, and about 10% repeat after <= 7000
packets. (Measured over 59881 packets, each with its own destination.)
Now I thought the process was something like 8 bits cycle plus 8 random
bits, but it's actually a bit more complex. So no mathematical
explanation, sorry ;-)
