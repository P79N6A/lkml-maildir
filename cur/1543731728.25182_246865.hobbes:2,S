Changes:
- bugfix release, a couple of minor changes here and there
Nothing special, really. One bigger change - on archs that have >1 possible 
page sizes (PAGE_SIZE definition in asm/page.h) we're now using a call to 
libc's getpagesize(), so don't count on it being static on archs like ia64.
Enjoy.
