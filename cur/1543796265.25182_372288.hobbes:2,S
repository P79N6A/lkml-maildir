I think the problem is in using the work 'time' in both.  Split that
so that they are seperate, and alot of the confusion will go away.  Do
I have a usefull suggestion?  No, I'm being fairly dumb this
morning... but just seeing all your smart guys getting confused makes
me think they rest of us would be lost too.
Hmm... how about:
	timer - gotta let me know exactly when it expires, I won't
		touch it until it does.
	reminder - I'll generally clean this up before it fires ,
		   don't care if I get reminded a bit later.
