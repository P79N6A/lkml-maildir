OK, feel free to correct.  :)

The IRQ is always active-low ... but sometimes that signal line
will get hooked up to a type of GPIO pin that doesn't support
that type of trigger.  In that case the driver workaround is to
trigger on the falling edge ... "falling" always precedes "low".
However, I double checked and in this case my patch goofed.  It's
incorrect to set TRIGGER_LOW and then add TRIGGER_FALLING later,
so of course the previous code was buggy, but in this case the GPIO
should have been left at TRIGGER_FALLING.  So I'll resend this patch.
(The problem was that I misremembered the difference between MPUIO
and GPIO.  It's not that GPIO supports level triggering; it's that
GPIO also allows "both edges" triggers.)

At some point it should be made to compile on non-OMAP systems,
if for no other reason than to address that problem!

Yes, please.  Fixes for build breakage and other "brown paper bag" errors
should have a high merge priority.
