Basically, the problem found was when I tried to use INTx mode 
for hot-plug controllers in ACPI enabled kernel.  I don't think 
this is related to MSI; the way I stated in the original email 
was not clear.  
I tried to boot with "pci=routeirq" and I got proper dev->irq for 
the hot-plug controllers. This tells me that my hot-plug drivers 
need to call pci_enable_device(), correct?

I will send them to you.
