Well, this is a little different. I was more concerned about the
"Heisenberg effect" that the in-kernel copies to fetch profiling data
had upon the data fetched. i.e. instead of idle time and the stuff I
was looking for, I saw copy_to_user() and all kinds of vfs and /proc/
crap instead, which blew what I was looking for completely out of the
top 20. The profiling I did was on UP, which was done in part to
eliminate lock contention as the cause of the phenomena I had observed.
Also, Randy said I should mention that my kerneltop-like thingie is
about 5 times faster (well, uses about 20% of the cpu time) as the
read()-based kerneltop. Which is all well and good, but the reason I
actually needed this was to get rid of the Heisenberg problem.
