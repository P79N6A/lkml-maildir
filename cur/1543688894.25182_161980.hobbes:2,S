fast restransmit are good to trigger, they don't arrive in a flood like
if we had a huge cwnd, if we can send packets out of the network,
they're right to be sent. During congestions the outgoing acks will be
rejected too (it's limiting both ways).
there is no difference between artificial congestion generated by a
shaper and a true congestion. If tcp is correct it has to slowdown
immediatly when it notices congestion.
I also don't see anything specific to a busy http server non support
keepalive in this ack-fast-retransmit matter.
