Looks OK... any reason you aren't using the asm-generic folding headers?
(asm-generic/pgtable-nopmd.h or asm-generic/pgtable-nopud.h). I sent some
notes to the arch list about getting those working, but apparently it
hasn't come though yet.
Of course I do think it is sensible that you just get it working first,
before getting too fancy.
