Thanks to everyone who replied. I've now got Donald Becker's natsemi
drivers from his site and have successfully compiled it. Whether it'll
work is another story as I've got to crack this box and put in the card..
Won't be long before I'll have my 100 megabits home network up and
running, I hope. <big evil grin> Not long before I'll frag my kid brother
in Quake too!
Cheers,
Alex
