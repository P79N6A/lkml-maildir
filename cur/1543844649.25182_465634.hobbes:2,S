I don't recall any particular ARM problems, so I'm curious too.  I'm
presently pulling git+ssh://master.kernel.org/home/rmk/linux-2.6-arm.git,
which is coming up empty.
OTOH, I doubt if anyone runtime tests -mm on arm.
OTOH^2, people do cross-compile.
OTOH^3, my attempts to build an arm cross-compiler haven't been very
successful.  I do have a .config which compiles, but allmodconfig used to
die due to the compiler not understanding weird `-m' options.  <tries it>. 
OK, that got fixed, so without CONFIG_AUDIT, arm allmodconfig compiles.  Am
happy.
