Subject: io scheduler silly question perhaps..

I have an embedded system which has two read-only flash devices (one a
PIO ATA flash disk, and one MDMA capable flash)
As I'm doing no writing in this system and most of my reads are sequential
(streaming movies or images) would my choice of io scheduler be very
important?
Regards,
Dave.
