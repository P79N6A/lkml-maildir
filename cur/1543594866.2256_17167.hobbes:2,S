Seconded.
Exactly the same symptoms (bzip2); the culprit turned out to be memory.
That's when I wrote memburn (
http://v.iki.fi/~vherva/memburn.c
) for quick
testing without a boot (it did find the problem) and I then verified the
problem with memtest86 (
http://reality.sgi.com/cbrady_denver/memtest86/
).
You do have to run either for hours, propably for days to be sure. 
The box has now ran perfectly for a year or so with the BadRam patch from
Rick van Rein (

).
