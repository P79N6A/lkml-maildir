ok.

ok - pr_debug() is ok i think for the APIC code. It pairs well with the
other variants: pr_notice(), etc.

i'd suggest to first do the Dprintk -> pr_debug replacement patch with
as few output changes as possible. (output changes are unavoidable when
converting a \n-less printout.) Then do any format cleanups in a
separate patch.
(some of your other comments about 'spurious' whitespaces need a
double-check too, sometimes they are done for formatting reasons. So
always take a look at the log output before changing it.)
