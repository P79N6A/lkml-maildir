I have one question: How it can happen that low_queued_sectors
is less than zero with this changed logic? (And if it get triggered, 
low_queued_sectors will be greater than high_queued_sectors - which 
is not what we want...)
But it is certainly better than 2.4.0-pre8 approach, as
with 200MB of memory (exactly 192MB left unused) you can end up with 
low_queued_sectors == 0... And it does not give you optimal behavior.
                                        Best regards,
