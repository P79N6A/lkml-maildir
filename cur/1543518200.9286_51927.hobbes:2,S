This is probably the problem, because statd is running on the server
but not on the client.
My next problem is how to get a working rpc.statd for linux? I've
found one:
  www.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/rpc.statd/statd-0.2.4.tar.gz
But I can't seem to compile it, and not much documentation comes with
it.  Is there a trick?
Thanks,
Miklos
