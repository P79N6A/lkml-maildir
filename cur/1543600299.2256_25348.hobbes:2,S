Oh you can certainly defeat it. That doesn't actually bother me. Firstly
nobody at Nvidia and friends is trying to mislead us, its their end users
who are. Secondly your average corporate lawyers get upset about putting
in license tags that are not true in case a court holds them to the tags,
and thirdly since its arguably digital rights management they might face
five years in jail in the USA for doing so 8)
