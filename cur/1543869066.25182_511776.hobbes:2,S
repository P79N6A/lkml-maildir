hm, this patch series seems to have gone out of its way to cause problems.
This particular (pathetically changelogged) patch is already in my tree,
only in a later, much more comprehensive form.  Similarly the HVC changes
were already in Rusty's stuff and were supposed to be merged by Paulus, but
haven't been yet.
Can we just drop this one?  Does the Xen work actually depend on it?
