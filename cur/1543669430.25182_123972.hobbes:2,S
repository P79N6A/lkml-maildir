If your patches would just removes these restriction, I wouldn't mind at

I don't want to forbid you anything, I want that you explain what you do, 
as your patches do more than simply enlarging dev_t. You still avoid any 
clear answer about this.

They are not independent. You want to have a larger dev_t so it can be 
used for 2.6, but this also requires an answer to the question "How will 
it be used during 2.6?".
