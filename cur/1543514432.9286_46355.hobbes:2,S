Hi!
I think I've found out why my machine corrupted data so fast:
It was using part of ram which was not mapped. Perhaps we should do
very fast memory test on bootup, just to make sure that all memory
regions we marked as RAM are really RAM and not fixed memory
containing -1 like in my case?
This was really nasty. Lots of lost files and similar funnies.
