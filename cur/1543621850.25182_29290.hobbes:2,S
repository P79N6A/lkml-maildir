Ok, after playing with it a little more I found out that the message I'm
getting about the block sizes isn't related to the lockups.  I can lock
the system up by tar'ing up the /proc directory (why are you tar'ing the
/proc directory!!! I know!!! But that's not the point).  I had no
problem with RH 7.2's supplied 7.2 kernel (2.4.7-10).  However, this is
2.4.17 (with the linux-abi patch). 
I have been able to make succesful backups as long as I ignore the /proc
directory but something must be wrong.  Doing an "ls -la *" doesn't lock
the machine though.  Only when tar'ing it (I suppose because of a read).
It doesn't lock up consistently in the same place when reading from the
proc directory however, but always in the proc.  I made about 15 test
runs and they all died in proc and --exclude proc doesn't cause it to
lock somewhere else.
I guess the question is (and I've had it for a while) is how do I get
the system to log more info for me?  I'm a little new a debugging the
kernel, but I did compile most of the debugging into a test kernel.
However, the system hard locks with no oops or anything in the logs.
The system must be shutdown by holding the power button in for 4
seconds. I know this must not be a huge problem because no ones
mentioned it, so I'd like to do some more investigating on my part.
Thanks for your help.
