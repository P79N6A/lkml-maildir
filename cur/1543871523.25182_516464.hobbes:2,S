I guess you have access to the source code of this virtual BIOS. So this
is a real cute technical solution.
ROTFL. The number of lame excuses in this whole virtualization
discussion is amazing.

Nothing forces you to follow that low level hardware scheme. That's
_WHY_ clockevents are there. Create a per cpu clock event source, which
uses whatever interrupt you want (you just need to be able to pin it to
the cpu)

It is partially, because clockevents remove the hardcoded hardware
assumptions.

The "we are harming no one" argument is a great excuse to push random
hackery into the kernel. Once it is there, there is no rush to fix it
because it works (for you).
That's exactly the point which is discussed in the "Xen & VMI" thread.
We open up a can of worms and within no time we have 5 or more different
solutions for the same problem. If we do not look careful at this, we
have no way to do any changes in the core code w/o breaking one of those
hypervisor interfaces. The in tree / FOSS hypervisor interfaces might be
fixable, but those which throw a binary blob to the kernel are not.
I completely agree with Ingo, that this whole paravirt business starts
to crawl across the kernel spreading paralyis all over the place.
We have already enough trouble with real hardware, so we want to
carefully avoid that we get broken virtual hardware as an extra workload
via paravirt ops.

It is guarded by the fact, that you are not registering clockevent
devices. It's not guarded by design. It happens to work.

clockevents have been around for quite a time - pun intended :). They
did not surface surprisingly with 2.6.21-rc1.

The periodic mode is only used during boot time, when you have NO_HZ
and/or HIGH_RES_TIMERS enabled. Once you switch over to NO_HZ and / or
HIGH_RES_TIMERS the periodic mode is gone for ever.
All paravirt users probably want to have NO_HZ, so PARAVIRT might simply
depend on NO_HZ. Of course I might be wrong :)
OTOH the stolen time accounting should be fixed in general and not rely
on it happens to work now assumptions. And it should be done for _ALL_
hypervisors in the same way, i.e. in the generic code.
The vcpu binding of jiffies update is a nobrainer to fix.

See above.

See above.

bugs in the hypervisor ? :)

Yes. It's gross hackery. 
1) We want to have a cleanup of the tick assumptions _all_ over the
place and this is going to be real hard work.
2) As I said above. The time accounting for virtualization needs to be
fixed in a generic way.
I'm not going to accept some weird hackery for virtualization, which is
of exactly ZERO value for the kernel itself. Quite the contrary it will
make the cleanup harder and introduce another hard to remove thing,
which will in the worst case last for ever.

There is no problem for realtime uses, as the reprogramming path is
running with local interrupts disabled. I can see the point for paravirt
and I'm not opposed to change / expand the interface for that. It might
be done by an extra clockevents feature flag, which requests absolute
time instead of relative time.
Sorry for not replying back then, your mail got into the huge pile of "I
take care of those, when I have some time" mails.

Dave Miller did a conversion of SPARC64 to clock sources and clock
events within a couple of days. He hit _AND_ fixed a couple of bugs in
the go. But he simply did it.
So your "it takes time" prayer wheel is not impressing me at all. 
clockevents have been there long enough to shake out the problems. It
would have been certainly more helpful for everybody if you had started
to use them early and to provide bugreports and/or patches instead of
insisting on the "our hackery works" approach.

Fix is already in Linus tree.
