The name says exactly what it is. It's not at all dreadful. If we're going 
to return a special value in the zero-size case (and in only that case) as 
a valid pointer instead of actually allocating one byte and treating it as 
zero, what we have is...a zero-size pointer. ZERO_SIZE_PTR is a pretty 
damn good name.
