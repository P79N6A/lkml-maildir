There are a few NFS operations (or related ones such as
for file locking) which do not need that information IIRC.
"old behavior" means doing what it does _today_.

NFS with AUTH_UNIX authentication cannot possibly get worse than it is
today with respect to processes in more than 16 groups. And the patch
is effectively disabled for processes in <=16 groups so I wouldn't
worry.
Anyway, a revised patch from you which no longer sorts the first 16
groups for compatibility reasons is probably easier to get merged.
