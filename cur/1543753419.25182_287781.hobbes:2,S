Here's a patch that adds the missing read_is_locked() and
write_is_locked() macros for IA64.  When combined with Ingo's patch, I
can boot an SMP kernel with CONFIG_PREEMPT on.
However, I feel these macros are misnamed: read_is_locked() returns true if
the lock is held for writing; write_is_locked() returns true if the
lock is held for reading or writing.
