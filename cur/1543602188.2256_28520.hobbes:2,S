Okay, I plugged some old hd into my computer and formatted one half with 
ext2, the other half with reiserfs. 
It seems to be definitely a reiserfs issue because I cannot trigger the 
performance loss (permament hd head positioning) with ext2. However, 
passing -o notail when mounting does not help. (-o notail is accepted and 
`bash# mount' displays `/dev/hdxy on /mnt type reiserfs (rw,notail)')
Could you reproduce this? Did you even try?
And why does this not show up on kernels <=2.4.6 and shows up 
with linux>=2.4.9 (2.4.7, 2.4.8: unknown)?
