Our webservers hit a load average of 80+ for about four hours twice a
week.  However, I don't want anyone to optimise the scheduler.  I want
us to fix our _dumb_ cgis.  And we are working hard at doing that.
As it is, I agree totally with Larry. If your load is this high in
normal use its probably a sign you're being dumb.  I know we are.
I don't think linux should optimise for the "I'm being dumb and I want 
the kernel to solve my problems" case.
