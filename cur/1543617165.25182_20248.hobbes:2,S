I would make this an even stronger statement:
We (yes, we) should make sure Aunt Tillie doesn't ever have to build a
kernel, ever.  If we have designed our kernels so that:
a) A distributor needs more than a handful of kernels (UP, SMP,
   SMP+PAE, perhaps CMOV or not) on their install CD, or;
b) It's not possible to add a driver without rebuilding the kernel, or;
c) It's not possible to autodetect the module set needed AT RUNTIME;
then we have screwed up.  Kernel compile autoconfiguration is a red
herring in that respect; I would argue if anything it hides the real
issue.  We're currently crappy at both (b) and (c) -- a monolithic
kernel does (c) a lot better, and that is quite frankly unacceptable.
