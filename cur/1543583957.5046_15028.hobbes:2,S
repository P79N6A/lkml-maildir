Unless he's actually hot-plugging the card, I am guarnateed to see both
the A and the B channel prior to actually registering with the SCSI subsystem
and from looking at the PCI probe code, function 0 is always added to the
pci device list before function 1.  It is true that my adapter sorting
code assumes that function 0 is seen prior to function 1, but I don't see
(yet) how that assumption is violated.  Since getting rid of the assumption
is easy enough, I'll do that.  All of the sorting stuff only works for devices
in the system at driver initialization.  In the hot plug case, you don't know
that more adapters will show up, so there is no way to defer registration like
you can on initial driver startup.
