It worked (ish.. it has problems and always has had) before the big
updates, and according to my tester after the big update + two patches
that escaped somewhere in the process. Unfortunately my tester no longer
has the card to dig further.
The 0x0 bug was fixed a while ago but seems to have sat in -mm for a bit.
Don't know about further stuff.
