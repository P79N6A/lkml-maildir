So if you mean from within the kernel context that is doable,
so long as we only have one process with pid == 1.
Although we may be able fix the kernel limitations in setsid().
For multiple pid == 1 case I don't know of another place in
the kernel I can possibly put this.  I can't put it later
because there is no place later, and I can't put it earlier
or else my efforts would just get stomped.
So I did it this way so I don't have to come back and change it to
this next week.  I'd love to have a better place to put this
code.
