It depends upon the disk devices, i.e., IDE SCSI, etc., but in
general all errors reported by the hardware result in retrying
the operation. If the retry fails after several (device dependent)
attempts, the actual error is reported as a kernel message. These
errors can be retrieved using the `dmesg` command and they
will usually be retained in some kernel log in /var/log (actual
log-name is vendor dependent).
Following the Unix convention, any errors reported back upstream,
eventually to the user, get reported ONLY as something defined
in /usr/include/errno.h (which includes others, ultimately
/usr/asm/errno.h).
So, you don't need to reinvent anything. If you have hardware
errors they will be reported in /var/log/messages (or whatever)
and if you are making a new driver, you are expected to comply
with the same protocol.
