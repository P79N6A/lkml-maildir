Subject: nfs inode busy message in 2.2.4

Since I booted 2.2.4 (with the b_count patch), I have been seeing things
like this:
kernel: __nfs_fhget: inode 218787 busy, i_count=2, i_nlink=1 
kernel: nfs_free_dentries: found //ROCKY2.JPG, d_count=0, hashed=1 
kernel: nfs_dentry_delete: //ROCKY2.JPG: ino=218787, count=2, nlink=1 
The file in question had been deleted many hours previously from an NFS
server on a Solaris system.  The message was apparently triggered by a
cron job that does a find.  The file had been moved to the server, used
there by a program running on the server, and then deleted (but now I
can't remember if I deleted it from the server side or the client side).
Anyhow it had a fairly short life.  And the system was pretty quiescent
after that until the find ran.
The mount looks like this:
bhmeg:/home/bhmeg/tomh on /home/bhmeg/tomh type nfs
(rw,timeo=14,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,addr=<whatever>)
I'll see if I can get it to happen again, this time noting who deleted the
file.

Life would be a ding-a-derry,
