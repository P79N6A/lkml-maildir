Maybe not specifically for a double fault, but I'm certain I checked it for some of the IST ones; looking at the code I
also can't see anyting obviously wrong. But clearly, a double fault has its most likely reason being a bad kernel stack
pointer prior to a page (or other) fault. It would therefore be necessary to know the value of the stack pointer as
retrieved from the double fault stack, which with the current display logic is not possible.
