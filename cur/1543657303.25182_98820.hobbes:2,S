Thanks. 
Having a full system like this showed a few special cases in sysenter
handling, where some system calls really depend on the old "iret" return
path.
Notably, "sys_iopl()" requires the iret path because that's the only way
to restore the full eflags, and "execve()" requires the iret return path
because it needs to start up the new process with fixed values in
%edx/%ebx, and the stack has a new layout and no longer contains the
required sysexit fixup code.
I've pushed the fix for both of these issues to the kernel -bk trees. 
Without the fix, a system with sysenter support would not boot up cleanly
with these libraries due to the execve() issues, and X wouldn't start
because of the iopl() problem.
With this in place, I've not seen any strange behaviour, and "lmbench" 
reports

with the new one - note the null call/io and signal install improvements).
