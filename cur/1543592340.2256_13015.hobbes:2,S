I'm trying to find the easiest way to to deidcate one CPU to responding
to a specific Interrupt request.
That CPU should only listen for that request while all other CPU should
ignore the interrupt.
Any suggestions? Do I have to muck with the IO_APIC or is there a
simpler way which I just missed?
Any help would be appreciated!
Thank you!
