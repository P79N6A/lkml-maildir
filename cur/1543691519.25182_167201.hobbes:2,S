Sorry it's taken a while to reply, but I even now haven't had a chance to 
look that deep into this problem. I will say that this is the wrong 
approach to the problem. 
Upon initial inspection, it looks like it will do the right thing in all 
cases, except when a parent is removed before a child is (but we don't 
technically support that now). 
However, I'd like to move away from the automatic cleanup that sysfs was 
doing. attribute groups make it easier to clean up all the files that are 
created for an object when the object is removed. I would like to see that 
removal call inserted where necessary, instead of adding this complication 
to the sysfs core.
I intend to remove the automatic cleanup in sysfs_remove_dir(), but 
haven't gotten around to it.. 
Thanks,
	Pat
