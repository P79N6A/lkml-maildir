The strategy GCC uses is to emit memcpy/memset for short blocks and call
function for others expecting that the function will contain all nasty
tricks possible.  For large blocks this is a win concerning code size
bloat caused by inlining MMX loops.
Nontemporal stores is definitly win for large blocks that does not fit
into cache as a whole, I am not sure whether this is the case of kernel.
I think kernel itself is usually zeroing memory just before it is used,
but I may be mistaken.

I don't do that at the moment.  I am thinking about teaching it to use
SSE moves for moving/clearing 64bit and larger values in memory.
(ie for inlining constantly sized string operations)
