I am sorry: I failed to point out that NAT does the job!
We think that the the proposed patch, that is a really small one,
introduces a facility that works well for existing operating systems 
and is desired by customers. Consequently, it enriches the kernel with
a concept that has already proven its value. That's the reason why we 
think the kernel could profit from the application of the corresponding 
patch, especially as it makes more customers happy. As the whole feature 
may be configured out we don't see what's wrong with making more and 
especially large customers happy with an enriched kernel.
