Well, this doesn't quite work. It initially seemed to prevent audio
skips, but now I can't launch a new Eterm (with translucency) with the
music not skipping, no change from stock -mm. It seems to work better
under heavy load (extracting a chroot tarball for example) than when
nothing is happening, which kind of puzzles me. In both cases I launch
a new Eterm while music is playing.
Inexplicably, it sometimes prevents skipping entirely.
I'm on a P4 2.0GHz with 256MB of SDRAM.
Regards
Josh
