You can get ext2 sufficiently hosed that you can't mount it or run fsck off
it as well. Ok its harder, and "-o mount_me_harder" might be useful for 
reiserfs in this situation.  
There is another reason for doing rescue without disk writeback which is
more pressing - bad disks _often_ go close to read only when they begin
to fail.
Also you need a true mount purely read only (or some kind of initrd deep
voodoo) to use ext3 or reiserfs with swsuspend
