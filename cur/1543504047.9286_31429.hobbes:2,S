No. It's not parallel port based (hell, it's not even pc based). Its a custom
bit of hardware that uses three lines on the parallel port, and communicates
using a simple serial-esque protocol. It transfers bytes bit-by-bit, using
an ACK and DATA line.
Here's an example. I send a bit on the data line, and the device responds
by bringing the ACK line high .. I then have to bring ACK low and send the
next data bit within 20-40 usecs.
Is gettimeofday accurate enough for this?
Thanks,
Rob.
