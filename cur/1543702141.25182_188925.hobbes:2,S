It still shows up. BIOSes use it exactly to tell the system about reserved 
magic IO regions (like the IO registers that are reserved for ACPI).
ISA may be gone, but the crap it left behind lingers on. The BIOS writers 
know that they can affect windows IO region allocation with it, so they 
still do - to make sure windows boots even when the hardware has some 
strange IO resource allocations. 
And yes, that is likely to be an issue on x86-64 too.. As far as windows 
is concerned, it's just another 32-bit CPU.
