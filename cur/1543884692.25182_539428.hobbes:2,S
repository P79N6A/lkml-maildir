Trent is mentioning an out-of-tree building system to allow easier
testing of V4L/DVB patches by end users and developers and during driver
development time. The building system allows faster
compilation/linkedition during driver development, by allowing you to
use:
	make menuconfig/qconfig/xconfig
inside the tree, unselecting the drivers that you're not working.
This way, our building system allows testing Kconfig menus, and properly
process Kconfig items for building drivers. 
The point rised by Trent is that, currently, this is not prepared to
handle the "menuconfig" and "if/endif" tags.
However, the v4l-dvb building system shouldn't stop improvements at the
kernel building system. So, if there are any limits there, the proper
solution is to fix the issues, instead of avoiding patches that could
break it.
