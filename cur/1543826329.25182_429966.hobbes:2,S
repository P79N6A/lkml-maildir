Like "3" it make code more understandable,
reader of code don't have to think why
code looks like:
lock A, lock B unlock A, unlock B
while a normal practice in kernel:
lock A, lock B unlock B unlock A
the goal of change just simplicity and clearness,
and nothing more.

To avoid incomprehension, previous patch just make code more
understandable and unlock mutex on "error path", it doesn't fix
this warning and I have no idea why it happend:
====================================
[ BUG: possible deadlock detected! ]
------------------------------------
mount/5587 is trying to acquire lock:
 (&jfs_ip->commit_mutex){--..}, at: [<c02f7096>] mutex_lock+0x12/0x15
but task is already holding lock:
 (&jfs_ip->commit_mutex){--..}, at: [<c02f7096>] mutex_lock+0x12/0x15
which could potentially lead to deadlocks!
other info that might help us debug this:
2 locks held by mount/5587:
 #0:  (&inode->i_mutex){--..}, at: [<c02f7096>] mutex_lock+0x12/0x15
 #1:  (&jfs_ip->commit_mutex){--..}, at: [<c02f7096>] mutex_lock+0x12/0x15
