While it certainly makes sense to expect a performance hit for mem above 4GB 
on 32 bit systems I don't see why there should be any a priori reason to 
either move to 64 bit or take a performance hit for if you need, say,  2GB of 
RAM. The problem is that 2.4 Linux considers HIGHMEM to be anything above 
896MB.
