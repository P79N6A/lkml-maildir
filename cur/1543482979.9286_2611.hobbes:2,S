I agree with you, Gabriel. Scheme with bus view of `address' in base_address
works ONLY if all buses in computer uses same translation scheme.
But if you have two buses, one connected (for example) directly to
CPU and another through translating bridge, you must have two different
ioremaps. But if you place `physical' address into base_address, non-bus
mastering devices will work without problems.
And busmastering devices do not know, where is mapped system memory
from bus view, so we lose nothing (yes, we are loosing busmastered
transfers inside one PCI bus... But I think that this can be done
by simple, bridge-specific function
bus_addr_t wheretoDMA(bus* source, bus* destination, bus_addr_t destaddr)).

This is fine from my viewpoint. Of course,
    pci_read_config_dword(dev, PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_n, &dev->base_address[n]);
    /* do nothing in pcibios_fixup() */
    address used in driver = ioremap(dev->bus, dev->base_address[n])
so we still have unchanged bus address for busmastering transfers.
