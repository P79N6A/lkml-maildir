Side note - and I didn't do this - this also allows you to disable 
slabinfo for those people who think it is pointless.
In particular, you could just make that

Kconfig entry use something like
	bool "Enable /proc/slabinfo support"
(perhaps adding an "if EMBEDDED" at the end), and now people can decide 
whether they actually want it or not (independently of whether they use 
SLUB or SLAB or whatever). But I left it hardcoded to on, just because I'm 
not sure it's worth it.
