glibc only tries to use sys_exit_group if the kernel headers it's compiled
against define __NR_exit_group.  AFAIK only the current RH beta ships
a kernel with a 2.4 backport of all the threading changes during 2.5, so
it might be worth asking the mdk glibc maintainer we he got his kernel
headers from.. (either redhat or 2.5 :))
