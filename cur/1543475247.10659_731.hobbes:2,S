It is supported to work.  If the X-Server does crazy things with the video
board, it _must_ reverse these on exit and console switches.  It works
with the text console, why it should'nt work with fbcon too?
It does'nt work (some versions of??) AccelX, becauce it _allways_ switches
back to 80x25 text mode.
There are some boards where you can't read the current state (completely).
With these the X-Server of cource has bad/no chances to restore things
correctly.  Blame your hardware.  With such hardware you probably have the
same problem if you try to switch between two X-Servers or between X and
svgalib.
