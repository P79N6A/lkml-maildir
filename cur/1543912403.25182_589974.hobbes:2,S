Hi guys,
I found that in the function parse_tag_ramdisk , the setup_ramdisk is
called. is it true that in the setup_ramdisk the location ot the
initrd is specified?
it seems that in my case the parse_tag_ramdisk is never accessed. what
might cause this?
in the parse_tag_ramdisk  the tag should be specified, where to
specify the "tag" and how?
thanks your answer is appreciated.
regards,
yang
