   This patch changes network devices to run hotplug out of the
   kobject/class_device infrastructure rather than calling it from the
   network core. The code gets simpler and there is only one place for
   Greg to fix when he changes the API ;-)
I'll apply this patch, looks fine.
   Paranoid about some driver doing something like:
   	rtnl_lock(); register_netdevice(); unregister_netdevice(); rtnl_unlock() BOOM
These sorts of turds exist at least in two places:
1) drivers/net/wan/comx.c
2) drivers/net/wan/hdlc_fr.c
But it is pretty clear that these two drivers have been
tried by nobody in recent years.  They both call into
{un,}register_netdevice without the RTNL semaphore held.
