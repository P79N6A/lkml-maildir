Like I said, the criteria was who responded the most. I actually don't
keep track of the mm work and someone else is probably better at
deciding this. But since it doesn't exist _at_all_ in MAINTAINERS I
figured that if I post this, it will soon be added.

Even if Christoph is not chosen, please do add a MEMORY MANAGEMENT in
the MAINTAINERS.  I don't want to keep looking back in my email logs to
remember what that mm email list was called again.
Also, I would like to see linux-arch mentioned in the MAINTAINERS file
since before I new about it, I just emailed every arch maintainer that I
could find in the list separately, when making a change that all archs
needed.
