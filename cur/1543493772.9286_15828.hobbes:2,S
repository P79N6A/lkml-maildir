Really? I thought this simplest approach - have a number of threads or
even independent processes which all do accept() themselves - is not
done because of the thundering herds problem.
I think the reason is this: you can't bind more than one socket to an
address to listen on, so all processes share the same listening FD
(dup() wouldn't help because it just creates a new reference to the
same socket.) When this FD becomes ready, all processes waiting on it
get woken up.
