Hold on. What about a process that fork()s, the parent process does
something and the child (with pid=cpid) then does setpgid (0, cpid);
and then creates threads.
Now we want to send a signal to the group which has the parent *and*
child processes. But we can't, right?

Maybe I should have written my proviso in shiny red letters. I said
"if we could find some clean and lightweight way"... I'm not saying
that there *is* a clean and lightweight way.

OK. Is there a way of supporting the example I quoted above with
process groups? How would you do it?

Larry, I hate to disappoint you, but you're agreeing with me :-)
This is why I said that if we can't cleanly support POSIX semantics,
we should try and get POSIX changed. But first we should let people
coding patches show whether or not they can provide a clean
implementation of POSIX semantics.
