Hi Linus, and all
Can you please apply the attached patch to your next release of 2.2pre or
to 2.2final .. it is against 2.2pre8 and fixes the NFS over TCP linux
client/server conflict I reported about 20 mins before I posted this :-)
This should fix NFS over TCP once and for all if not I'll be most
displeased :-)
Dave.
