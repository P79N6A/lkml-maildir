Subject: 2.6.9-rc1 & 2.6.9-rc1-mm1: can't shutdown / unregister_netdevice complains about my ipv6-in-ipv4 tunnel

When trying to shutdown my system with both 2.6.9-rc1 and 2.6.9-rc1-mm1,
I see:
unregister_netdevice: waiting for xs6all to become free
etc. when trying to reboot or shutdown.
I didn't see this in 2.6.8.1 nor in 2.6.8.1-mm1.
This is a plain ipv6-over-ipv4 tunnel like this:
/etc/network/interfaces:
auto xs6all
iface xs6all inet6 v4tunnel
        endpoint xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
        up ip route add 2000::0/3 via xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx
        address xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx:xxx
        netmask 64
        up ip tunnel change xs6all ttl 64
I'm running Debian Unstable with all the latest updates as of today.
Thanks for any hints,
Jurriaan
