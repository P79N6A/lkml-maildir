This really has become a FAQ by now. How about including the following
patch in Documentation/Changes?

 larger swap spaces, you need the new mkswap found in util-linux.  You
 also need to upgrade util-linux to get the latest version of mount.

+most prominently) were broken throughout the whole of 2.1 kernel 
+series, meaning that you will be unable to use 2.1-partitioned media on 
+Linux 2.2. This is not a 2.2 bug - 2.2 finally does the right thing!

+superfloppy format.]

+   To properly create partitions on 2048 byte sectored media with Linux
+2.2, be sure to use no less than fdisk version 2.9i and invoke fdisk
+using '-b 2048' as an option.
