Any chance you'd be willing to put down a few thoughts on what sorts
of standards you'd like to set for both correctness (i.e. the bare
minimum a scheduler implementation must do to be considered valid
beyond not oopsing) and performance metrics (i.e. things that produce
numbers for each scheduler you can compare to say "this scheduler is
better than this other scheduler at this.").
