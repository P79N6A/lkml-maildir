I thought mremap (no, that's already kind of messed up); or
even just getting consistency in failures (eg. so you don't have
the situation that a futex op can succeed on a previously
unmapped region).
If you're not worried about the latter, then it might work...
I didn't initially click that the private futex API operates
purely on tokens rather than virtual memory... comments in
futex.c talk about futexes being hashed to a particular
physical page (which is the case for shared). That's whacked.
So actually you would change semantics in some weird corner
cases, like mremaping a shared futex over a private futex's
Arguably that's broken, though ;)

No we shouldn't slow them down. I'd be interested to see whether
locking is significantly sped up with this new data structure,
though.
You might also slow down due to the fact that you'd have to do the
locking and unconditionally traverse the private futexes even for
shared futexes.
