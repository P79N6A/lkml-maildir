In the first place system administrator should not be configuring it
that way, Then they are using it as a strict hard limit than guarantee
(as the resources guaranteed to one container is _not_ available to
others).
Besides, the above configuration is clearly _not_ work conservative.
They should use both guarantee and limit to associate resources to a
container/RG.

CKRM/RG handles it this way:
Amount of a resource a child RG gets is the ratio of its share value to
the parent's total # of shares. Children's resource allocation can be
changed just by changing the parent's total # of shares.
If you case about initial situation would be:
  Total memory in the system 100MB 
  parent's total # of shares: 100 (1 share == 1MB)
  10 children with # of shares: 10 (i.e each children has 10MB)
When I want to add another child, just change parent's total # of shares
to be say 125:
  Total memory in the system 100MB
  parent's total # of shares: 125 (1 share == 0.8MB)
  10 children with # of shares: 10 (i.e each children has 8MB)
Now you are left with 25 shares (or 20MB) that you can assign to new
child(ren) as you please.
