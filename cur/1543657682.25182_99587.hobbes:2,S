Yes, this code was not functional (although compilable). I've noted this 
situation in my patch comment. We have to upgrade all old ISA PnP code to 
the new PnP layer. It's better to fail with an error than silently ignore 
this situation (this will force more developers to update their parts).
I'll update our ALSA code ASAP.
