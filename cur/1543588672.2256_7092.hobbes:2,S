Oh darn!  Must NOT do posts at 4AM!  
The standard says nanosleep MUST wait at LEAST the requested time. 
Since we are dealing with a 1/HZ time resolution (tick) the actual time
waited MUST fall between 10 and 20 ms.  Depending on if your code is
synced to the system clock or not you may see times closer to one end of
this range.  If you are not synced to the clock the average wait should
be about 15 ms.  (Note, locking to the clock in some way is relatively
hard to get away from.  After all this is the same clock that is used
for time slicing.)
