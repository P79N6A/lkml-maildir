Subject: [PATCH for review] [32/145] x86_64: A few trivial spelling and grammar fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: "Adam Henley" <adamazing@gmail.com>
A few trivial spelling and grammar mistakes picked up in
"arch/x86_64/aperture.c", "arch/x86_64/crash.c" and
"arch/x86_64/apic.c". I think all are correct fixes but am ever aware
of my fallibility :o) This is my first patch submission so all
feedback is appreciated, esp. WRT CCing to Linus, Andi and
trivial@kernel.org, is this correct? And which is the most appropriate
kernel version to diff against? If any.
Should apply cleanly to 2.6.18-rc1
