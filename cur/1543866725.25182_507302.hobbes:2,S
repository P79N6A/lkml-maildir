I also think the original patch is wrong.  It might shut up kernel
panic by eliminate double calls to aio_complete(), but it will
silently introduce data corruption.
If invalidate_inode_pages2_range() says it can not invalidate pages,
while dio to the same file offset range is in flight, something is
really wrong there.  In generic_file_direct_IO, the function
explicitly flushes all dirty pages and wait on them before submits
DIO.
So any error value returned from invalidate_inode_pages2_range() has
to be taken seriously in the direct IO submit path instead of dropping
it to the floor.
