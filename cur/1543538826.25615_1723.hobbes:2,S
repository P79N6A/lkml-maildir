No it wasn't. The original example was:
/*--------------------------------------------*/
#include <stdio.h>
FILE  *new;
main () {
   fclose (new); /* <----   SIGSEGV  on linux only  */
}
/*--------------------------------------------*/
There is a common and useful[1] programming style where you try to close 
all resources in case of an error in a common function. It is useful to 
not have to write if (ptr != NULL) closeit(ptr) all the time to handle 
the case where you bombed out in the middle.
The alternative is the error prone and ugly:
if (a = alloca()) { 
	if (b = allocb()) { 
		if (c = allocc()) { 
			if (d =allocd()) { 
				do_real_work();
				freed(d);
			}
			freec(c);
		}
		freeb(b);
	}
	freea(a);
}
which is IMHO just asking for obscure bugs in error paths.
/* a b c d are NULL */ 
a = alloca();
b = allocb();
c = allocc();
d = allocd(); 
if (a && b && c && d) 
	do_real_work(); 
freea(a); 
freeb(b); 
freec(c);
freed(d); 
Which one do you prefer ? 
So handling NULL in the low level library free routine makes it much
less likely that you screw up during resource cleanups. Writing
if (ptr != NULL) before free all the time is just redundant and can
be easily forgotten.
About the only argument I see is to make one undefined behaviour in ISO 
C crash instead of behave sanely to point out a potential portability
problem to some hosts (e.g. most Unixes seem to get this correct) early.
I prefer a sane behaviour instead though.

[1] It simplifies error handling and makes it more likely to be correct.
