2.6.24-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Michael E Brown <Michael_E_Brown@dell.com>
patch 7d640c4a5b36c4733460065db1554da924044511 in mainline.
This reverts commit 109f0e93b6b728f03c1eb4af02bc25d71b646c59.
The original patch breaks BIOS updates on all Dell machines. The path to
the firmware file for the dell_rbu driver changes, which breaks all of
the userspace tools which rely on it.
Note that this patch re-introduces a problem with i2c name collision
that was previously fixed by this patch.
