Every hash function you tried was influenced by your own experience.
You need some new ideas. This ought to work:
1. Collect real data and save it as C source code. (an array of unsigned)
2. Write a userspace hash function benchmark.
3. Put your source on the web.
4. Get the problem posted on www.slashdot.org as a challenge.
5. Keep a ranking on web to encourage competition.
BTW, your web server will need lots of bandwidth if you do this.
