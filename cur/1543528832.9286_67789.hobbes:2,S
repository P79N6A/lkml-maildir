The problem with USB ACM is that it queues the data from its irq
handler, and calls the line discipline's write_wakeup from irq context.
The standard PC serial driver calls write_wakeup from BH context.
PPP's write_wakeup then does some complicated stuff which isn't quite
irq safe, but could probably be made so.
Are you saying that the line discipline's write_wakeup should be a
simple function to queue the line discipline's BH (that's what "wakeup"
means to me), or that write_wakeup must be called from BH context by the
serial driver?
