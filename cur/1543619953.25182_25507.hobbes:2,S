Hello,
I am a french guy living in Lille and using/practising Linux for 6ish
years. Please could you Cc me any answer. thanks a lot.
I had a -long- look in the mailing list archives but couldn't find an
answer to the following question:
[Short] I boot 2.2.19 kernels without any problems but can't boot any
2.4.17 neither a 2.5.1.
[Details] I have a PC Packard-Bell imédia6007a
- AMD Athlon 1.4GHz
- Motherboard "Explorer" from Packard-Bell
- Chipset VIA KM133: VT8365A Northbridge (AGP,PCI) and VT686B
  Southbridge (IDE,USB) (BIOS recently upgraded)
- ATIRadeonVE 32MB
- Debian GNU/Linux Woody (non-official isos from 20/07/2001) with
  XFree86 upgraded from 4.0.3 to 4.1.0 (xfree86-common, xserver-common,
  xserver-xfree86) for radeon support.
Firstly, I want a 2.4.x kernel for the sound (alsa), the framebuffer and
the dri (I'd like to be able to play tuxracer ;o)
I boot my system with grub and there is no problem for the 2.2.19 kernel
packaged with the woody neither for the lighter one I compiled myself
from the debian packaged sources.
However, I hadn't any success booting a 2.4.17 kernel; I hadn't tried
every possibility but I tried:
- a 2.4.13 kernel compiled from the "generic" (I mean not the debian
  package, see below) sources.
- the kernel-image-2.4.17-k7_2.4.17-1_i386.deb debian package.
- many kernels compiled from kernel-source-2.4.17_2.4.17-1_all.deb
  debian package.
- a few kernels compiled from the 2.4.17 "generic" sources.
- a 2.5.1 kernel compiled from the "generic" sources (non patched).
I tried to compile for Athlon, PentiumPro, 386 -> same behavior
I tried with/out initrd support -> same behavior
I tried "mem=nopentium" boot option related to the radeon -> same behavior
I also tried lilo and boot disks both for grub and lilo -> same behavior
please help ! thanks a million.
[begin grub output]
  Booting command-list
root  (hd0,0)
  Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83
kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.17-k7 root=/dev/hda1 ro
  [Linux-bzImage, setup=0x1400, size=0x9b512]
initrd  /boot/initrd.img
  [Linux-initrd @ 0x17cb4000, 0x32c000 bytes]
Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel.
[end grub output]
and the machine is stucked there...
It seems to me that grub loads the kernel ok but when grub gives it the
hand, the problem occurs...
