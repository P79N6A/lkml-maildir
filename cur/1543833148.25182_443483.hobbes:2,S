Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Remove pci_dac_set_dma_mask() from Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/12/47

pci_dac_set_dma_mask() gives only a single match in the whole kernel tree
and that's in this doc file. The best candidate for replacement is
pci_dac_dma_supported().
