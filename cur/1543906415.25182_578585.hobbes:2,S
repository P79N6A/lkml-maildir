Bah. I should have thought of this better.
If you are using ZONE_MOVABLE and the zonelist is in zone order, one would
use memory from remote nodes when suitable local memory was available. I don't
have a quick answer on how this should be handled. The answer may be
something like;
o When ordering zonelists by nodes, order them so that the movable zone
  is paired with the next highest zones in a zonelist before moving to the
  next node
