This may be a dumb question, but how can we know if the write allocates are 
properly set or not ?
I asked a related question (about mtrr) on the list a while back and was told 
that the BIOS should manage it for me, which dosen't seem to be the case with my 
K6-III (2.2.9, 2.2.10 and 2.3.6).
I also tried 2.0.36 with WrtAlloc-2.0.36-3.patch applied and got this at boot:
WrtAlloc: No AMD K6 processor found. Nothing done.
I can't read the code, but judging from its release date, maybe K6-III isn't 
supported ?
