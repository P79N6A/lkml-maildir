IMHO kmem_cache_init() needn't to do anything for the slob allocation.
In addition, the original code allocate one page and then free it.
Here, with the patch, slob_alloc() will set the SLAB flag on the page,
and the page with this flag can't pass the free_pages_check(), if so,
the kernel will run into bad_page() panic.
So, I removed this piece of code for the draft of the patch.
Welcome any better idea.
