You'll want to clear VM_PFNMAP after unmapping all pages from it, before
switching to struct page backing.

If you do need to, then if your pfns are contiguous in virtual memory,
and you can spare vm_pgoff, then you can use remap_pfn_range's method
of setting vm_pgoff to the first pfn.
I can add a bit of sanity checking for that as well.

Hmm, but it might not be called from a pagefault. Can we get away
with not calling it? Or is it required by some architectures?
