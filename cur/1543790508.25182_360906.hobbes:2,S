Ogawa-san,
I'm bringing this to you attention because a) I'm not sure who to ask
and b) I'm not sure what the correct behaviour is.
When a vfat filesystem is mounted isocharset=iso8859-1, then the
following works:
touch a.txt
ls A.txt
But when it is mounted isocharset=utf8, then ls complains, file not
found:
touch a.txt
ls A.txt
That is, in utf8, a =! A on vfat, and thus its not case insensitive
as one might expect.
I took a quick look in fs/nls/nls_utf8.c and I see that this is
intentional.
static struct nls_table table = {
        .charset        = "utf8",
        .uni2char       = uni2char,
        .char2uni       = char2uni,
        .charset2lower  = identity,     /* no conversion */
        .charset2upper  = identity,
        .owner          = THIS_MODULE,
};
I guess it is charset2lower or charset2upper that vfat is calling,
which make no conversion, thus leading to the problem I outlined above.
My question is: Is this behaviour correct, or is it a bug?
