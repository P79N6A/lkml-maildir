I disagree - as Pavel said, "if it's running in your kernel's
userspace", the GPL applies only to the thing running in that
"userspace", not to the whole combined machine.

I understand the licensing in unambiguous causes, and I'm not trying
to find loopholes in awkward corners.  I'm just observing that, as
closed-source binary modules are de facto accepted (with some funky
rules about which interfaces they can use), the same in reverse
_ought_ to be accepted to the same degree: Linux (and other) GPL'd
modules as satellites around a non-GPL kernel.
