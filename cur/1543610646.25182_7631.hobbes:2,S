hello,
i've got quite a lot of response for this. oki, the problem is still
there and still no solution. somehow i was forced to do minor changes to
the previous *workaround*. at least to save myself from beeing bombed
again :) and save whoever uses this stuff, from getting complications,
please allow me to post this one.
reason: probably gcc3.0.2 bug
kernel: 2.4.10 -> X
result: solves some strange compile failure issues.
