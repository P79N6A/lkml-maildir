Just to try something, could you please take the program below and change
the 172 to be about 15-20 less that then number of MB of physical RAM
you have, then compile and run it and then try to suspend to disk
and see how long it takes.  On my Thinkpad 600E, it changes the time
to suspend from ~30 seconds to < 10 seconds.
This is an experiment to see if your BIOS is faster to suspend
when most of memory is zero'd.
Cheers,
Stephen
