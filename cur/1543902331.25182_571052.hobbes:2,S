i think it's very useful as a constant reality check. Yes, i did 
periodically boot your Zaphod scheduler too on a testbox ;-)
"CFS works well" cannot be determined reliably if there's nothing to
compare it against. One goal behind the CFS changes was to remove the
need for massive scheduler rewrites and to ease prototyping. Somehow
there are lots of people who really love to hack the scheduler,
those weirdos ;-)

well, kernel/sched_rt.c and kernel/sched_fair.c are already more 
different on a conceptual angle than any of the two schedulers in 
PlugSched i think. But ... i dont expect the initial port of PlugSched 
to be easy at all.

Yeah, i think starting with a smaller subset is the right approach - i 
think people _will_ fill the gaps ;-) I agree that preserving 
"Ingosched" would not make much sense. (Although it could still be 
useful to someone who finds some regression and suspects CFS, and wants 
to try with the old scheduler. Or just to test/prove that the 
modularization is strong enough to even include those scheduler 
heuristics the old scheduler did. Or out of historic interest.)

you are welcome :) Dmitry Adamushko and Srivatsa Vaddagiri already did 
lots of nice "policy module isolation" work in CFS (since the first 
crude cut i did in CFS v1), both for the cleanup factor and to enable 
features like group-scheduling.
