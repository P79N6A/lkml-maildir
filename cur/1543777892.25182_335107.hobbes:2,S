[Copying it to fastboot and linux-kernel mailing lists]
We are booting second kernel (capture kernel) from a reserved memory location
to take care of on-going DMA issues. So even if some DMA transactions are going
on after the crash they will not corrupt the new kernel.

That might very well be the case. So driver should simply ignore the interrupt
when it is not expecting it or it should reset the device if it finds that 
some interrupts are pending when it should not have been there.
Basically it is a matter of hardening the driver so that it can handle/
initialize the device even if the device is not in reset state.

After a crash (panic) we can not shutdown the devices. It is not reliable
and new kernel might not boot at all. We have had plenty of discussions on
this in the past on fastboot and linux-kernel mailing list.
It is not about problem being on kdump part or Fusion MPT driver part. This
is a new scenario for drivers after the introduction of kdump. Previously 
drivers could safely assume that BIOS had put the device in reset state but
after kdump it assumption is not valid.
