Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Use conditional

Hi,
this optimizes the case where no LSM is loaded and the (new) default 
capablities is used. These are not called via indirect calls but 
called as hardcoded calls and might thus be inlined; the price for
this is a conditional -- benchmarks done by hp showed this to be
beneficial (on ia64).
Enjoy,

Subject: Replace indirect calls by a branch
References: SUSE40217, SUSE39439
In the LSM stub collection, rather do a branch than an indirect
call. Many of the functions called do only return 0 or do nothing
for the default (capability) case.
This is a fast-path optimization; a branch is faster than an
indirect call, even more so if correctly predicted.
This shows a >3% perf. increase in netperf -t TCP_RR benchmark on IA64.
(More exactly: The benchmark was taken with the next two patches
 applied as well, but I attribute the main effect to this patch.)
This is patch 3/5 of the LSM overhaul.
