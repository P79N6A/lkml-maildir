True, but there's a cost of maintaining the source and reducing the
size of said source by order of magnitude will help to reduce _that_.
The argument would make sense if you were treating everything under
your compatibility layer as a black box, but I sincerely hope that
it's not the case.

Looking forward to that...  Just documenting the exclusion requirements
of CXFS would help.  Big way.  As it is, you are bordering on the "adding
undocumented API for proprietory module" and while I've got no problems
with the last part (I don't suffer from stallmanellosis), I really don't
like the first one.  Nobody's asking to give up the guts of CXFS, but
having its exclusion requirements documented is a different story.
