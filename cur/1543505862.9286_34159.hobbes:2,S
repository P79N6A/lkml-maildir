Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The patch below fixes a bug in ide-cd.c. In the CDROMREADAUDIO ioctl
it does:
        if (lba < 0 || lba >= toc->capacity)
            return -EINVAL;
Seems OK at first sight, but the ATAPI spec (8020rev26.pdf) says:
> but the exact definition of the returned logical block address is
> modified to allow returning a possibly inexact value (but one with a
> known error boundary) based on CD-ROM table of contents data. This
> error boundary occurs when the last track is an audio track, and
> could cause the last block to be +/- 75 sectors from the actual end
> of the track.
So the fix is easy:
