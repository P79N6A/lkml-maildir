OK.. this is strange, maybe.

?!?! Should the P4 really be able to go to 112%, and why would it do that
after I told it to go back to 100% ?
Any idea why the box would stall (at least no kb/mouse input is accepted,
not sure about other interrupts) for such a long time when changing the
speed?
On the other hand, some short (<1 min) cpu-bound processes for benchmarking
each took the same amount of time to run when the clock was at 12%, 100%,
and 112%, so I'm not sure the clock was really being changed at all.

Ian Morgan
