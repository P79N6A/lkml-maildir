My position isn't that we should use the high level clocksource
interface as it is now without changes .. That's never been my position
since I've been working with it.. The high level interface will need to
evolve. 
I'm saying we should use the clocksource structure as the main hook into
the low level architecture code.

My suggestion is only as good as the implementation .. Your making some
fairly sweeping assumption about how lockstat _would_ use the
clocksources in it's final form ..
So clearly lockstat has a contraint which is that it can't use slow
clocks..

I think we're just taking different perspectives .. The tsc clocksource
is just as fast as the tsc sched_clock() , you can interchange the two
without ill effects .. That's one perspective ..
You can use a yet to be written API that uses the GTOD and a
clocksource, and allows slow clocksources to be used in place of fast
ones with really bad effects, that's another perspective ..
