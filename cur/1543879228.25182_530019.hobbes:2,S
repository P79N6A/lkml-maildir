Hi Helge,
2.6.21-rc6 (without any -mm patches) works fine?
Could you please
- try booting without any HID devices plugged in (i.e. usb mice, usb 
  keyboards) if the problem persists?
- recompile 2.6.21-rc6-mm1 with git-hid.patch reverted to see if it helps?
I am unfortunately not able to reproduce it here on x86_64.
Thanks,
