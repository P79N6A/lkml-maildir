It's a philosophical thing.  Is a kernel thread like a user process which
happens to be running from the kernel or it is a piece of mainline kernel
code which happens to have its own execution context?  I rather favour the
latter...
In this case it looks like it will just happen to work, because
nfsd_setuser() is executed by nfsd, and kernel threads are allowed to do
copy_from_user() with the source in kernel memory.  ick.
Tim, I do think it would be neater to add another entry point in sys.c for
nfsd and just do a memcpy.
