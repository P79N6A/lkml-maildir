Ok, powerpc will have these in 2.6.20 then :-)
I'm tempted to remove those mmio_* things from iomap.c completely. I
need to check who uses them, but in all cases, I don't see what they do
in iomap.c, it's not their place.
Versions that would transparently use MMIO or PIO would make sense. A
pure MMIO implementation doesn't, that has to be arch specific. It makes
the generic iomap suddently non-portable in some ways.
So I think we need to make sure all archs grow readsb,sw,sl etc... and
just have iomap use those for the "transparent" versions.
Ben.
