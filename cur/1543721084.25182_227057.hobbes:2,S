OK.. Begging the question then - if I go *that* route, I can get rid of the
whole static inline and do it in the one place it gets called (since there's then
no #ifdef'ing in the main .c which was the style commentary I got)....
Would the Style Gods prefer Neils's suggested ifdef stuff in pid.h and then
the 3 line code in pid.c without ifdef's?
