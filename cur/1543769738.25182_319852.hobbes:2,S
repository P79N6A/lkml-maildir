Hi,
I'm seeing a lot of the following warnings when building the latest
-git kernel with the latest sparse checker:
/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/arm-linux/3.3/include/stdarg.h:54:9: warning: preprocessor token va_copy redefined
/home/rmk/git/linux-2.6-rmk/include/linux/compiler-gcc2.h:29:9: this was the original definition
Since sparse pretends to be a gcc 2.95 compiler, should it really
be using the gcc 3.3 header files?
Shouldn't it provide its own headers to correspond with the version
it pretends to be? 8)
