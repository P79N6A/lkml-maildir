Yup. I upgraded to .72 and tried again (using the new taskfile stuff) and
this time it suspended. On resume though, the framebuffer console wasn't
really functioning. I had to switch to X and then switch back again before
it was all groovy.
Ponderance: Why did it do a full s/w suspend when I asked for the bios
to handle it? I have s4bios showing up in /proc/acpi/sleep and the bios
is set to suspend to disk. I've even got an a0 partition fully formatted
and it still ignored it all.
I was using the following line to activate it:
echo 4b >/proc/acpi/sleep

Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some
of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi.
No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."
