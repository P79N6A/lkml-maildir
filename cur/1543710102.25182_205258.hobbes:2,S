I'll clean it and resubmit.

I see your point, but it's the Medley standard and the "official"  way
they detect the array. If I can't compare with the PCI vendor and device
ID, I have no reliable way (other than heuristics) to see if it is a valid
Medley superblock..  There are many different variants of Medley out
there, and they each use their own vendor/device ID as the superblock
magic word.
So I would prefer to keep these.
Thanks,
Thomas
