Ok. Is it possible to at least add message somewhere about existance of
RAID 0.90 patches ? Not everyone is reading l-k, you know. This way users
at least will know about RAID 0.90 existence (URL will not hurt as well)
and can try to apply them if stock RAID will fail...
P.S. Perhaps "Changes" file can include list of "well-known" patches ? That
"well-known" for kernel developers who read l-k regularly but not so
"well-known" for outsiders ? Things like KNFSD patches, RAID 0.90, IDE patches
and so on ? They can be "not good enough" for official kernel just yet but
peoples can find them helpfull sometimes... And it's not so easy to find URL
even if you are aware of such patch existance :-/
