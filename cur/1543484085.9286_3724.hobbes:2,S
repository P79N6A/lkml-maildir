Hi !
Linux 2.2.1 oopses after putting (silly) high values
into /proc/sys/net/core/[rw]mem_{default,max}.
I've tried this and then a 
while(1)
	write(sock, msg, 2<<21);
while the other end was not reading. It write returned after
queuing the full buffer (2MB(!)) and was blocked the second call.
From this point the machine starts oopsing but without running out
of memory. Nearly anything else fails by segfaulting after that
and a graceful shutdown was not possible.
