I can also easily recreate this by calling dhcpcd e.g. when the cable isn't in 
the socket yet. If i attach the cable then I see the interface coming up, 
going down, and then the NETDEV watchdog message.
Unfortunatly this usually means that dhcpcd goes hanging. ifconfig hangs too 
if I try to use it, and rebooting must be forced with sysrq and an oops a 
alt-sysrq-o for poweroff...
