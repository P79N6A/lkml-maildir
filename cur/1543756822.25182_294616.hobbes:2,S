I don't think he can.  A nodemask represents an unorderd set of nodes. 
He needs (or wants) to pass a <nid, nid> map, mapping the node that each
page might be on, to the node to which it should migrate.  A bitmask
doesn't contain enough information to specify that.
Perhaps instead he could pass two node arguments, old and new, with the
migration routines understanding that they were to migrate only pages
found on the old node, to the new node, ignoring other pages.
