Solution: This community needs a white list of functioning hardware.
If NOBODY ever would purchase a piece of hardware unless proven 
to work, there would be better support already.
How to make new hardware work? Manufacturers lend it to developers
and support development. 
I suppose my notebook will last 4 years again as it took too much
effort to make work. Another 30 month to go then...
