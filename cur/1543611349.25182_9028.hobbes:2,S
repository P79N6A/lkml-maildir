What I mean by I call rs_open() is that the person who writes the tty layer
should not call close() after open() fails, I cannot directly invoke rs_open()
and rs_close(), I KNOW that.
If I were to define an API like rs_open(), I would expect the person who
uses these API (rs_*) in our case the tty layer, to call rs_close()
only if rs_open() is successfull. I do not want to leave a dependency
that rs_close() SHOULD BE called even if rs_open() failed.
As you say this fix works for 2.4, Since we are into 2.5, I hope
that it will be fixed in a better manner in 2.5. I have some suggestions,
ideas for the serial driver in 2.5, are u willing to discuss them?
