My opinion now is that we should kill the version of in_ntoa that doesn't
take a buf, and force everyone to declare automatics. The two standard
uses of in_ntoa are:
 Orig:                        Fixed:
                              char a[18];
 printk(..., in_ntoa(foo));   printk(..., in_ntoa(foo, a));
  and                          and
 strcpy(buf, in_ntoa(foo));   in_ntoa(foo, buf);
Aside from the whole multiple printk args nuisance, is there anything that
makes in_ntoa threadsafe? Like always getting called under a network lock?
I don't think so. Since it looks like its getting called to fill in
protocol headers in NFS and the like, it could be dangerous.
There seem to be about 30 instances of ip_ntoa, none of ip_ntoa2, and
about 60 of NIPQUAD. NIPQUAD is a magic macro that expands to a single
macro and doesn't have a nice IPv6 analog and HIPQUAD is currently broken
wrt endianness so I'd vote for nixing them all in favor of a single
function that works like ip_ntoa2. NIPQUAD always appears as a *print*
arg, so replacement would be as above.
BTW, the v6 code currently has stuff like this in it (icmp.c):
                       printk(KERN_DEBUG "ICMPv6 checksum failed
                         [%04x:%04x:%04x:%04x:%04x:%04x:%04x:%04x >
                         %04x:%04x:%04x:%04x:%04x:%04x:%04x:%04x]\n",
                                ntohs(saddr->in6_u.u6_addr16[0]),
                                ntohs(saddr->in6_u.u6_addr16[1]),
                                ntohs(saddr->in6_u.u6_addr16[2]),

                                ntohs(daddr->in6_u.u6_addr16[7]));
Oh, and I'm guessing the ntohl below is wrong, Alan?
./drivers/net/wan/sdla_chdlc.c:
 in_ntoa(ntohl(chdlc_priv_area->IP_address)));
./drivers/net/wan/sdla_chdlc.c:
 in_ntoa(ntohl(chdlc_priv_area->IP_address)));
