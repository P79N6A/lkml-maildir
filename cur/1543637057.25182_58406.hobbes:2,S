As Alan has posted, this is a problem with code merged into rc2-ac6 and
after to support the high end IBM xSeries machines.
Its broken and myself and James Cleverdon are actively working the issue.
This is code that exists as a patch for the generic tree and works fine, but
something has gone oddly wrong here, we still havent tracked it down, but
stay tuned...
