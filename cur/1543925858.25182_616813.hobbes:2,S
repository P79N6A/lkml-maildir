Thomas - what is way forward here?
I consider the patch serie ready to be applied and I
leave it to you (x86 guys) to decide the way forward to mainline.
cleanup -> mm -> linus or straight to linus.
If there is any concerns (from you or others) please let
me know so we can get it fixed.
And I certainly hope that this serie brings no bugs to the kernel
but rather makes it easier to fix bugs..
