Hello,

This sounds like you haven't installed the "kernel-headers" package.
You need this package to build kernels.
Note that split-include.c is a host-side program, not a target-side
program.  If you have problems building host-side programs then it's
probably a glibc or a gcc problem, not a linux-kernel problem.
