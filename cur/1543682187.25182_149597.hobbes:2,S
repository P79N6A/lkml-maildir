I wonder if it can be related to the nfs changes. I also had those nfs
changes in my tree previously, but most of them rejected (i.e. a -R
wouldn't clean it up) so there must be further or slightly different
changes in mainline pre6 compared to 21rc8aa1. It could be only an
editing thing though.
It would be very interesting if you could still reproduce w/o nfs (for
example replacing the nfs transfers temporarily with an rsync, that
would reduce the scope of the problem a lot).
