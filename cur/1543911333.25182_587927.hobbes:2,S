Subject: [patch 05/28] i386: fix lazy mode vmalloc synchronization for paravirt

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: Zachary Amsden <zach@vmware.com>
Found this looping Ubuntu installs with VMI.
If unlucky enough to hit a vmalloc sync fault during a lazy mode
operation (from an IRQ handler for a module which was not yet populated
in current page directory, or from inside copy_one_pte, which touches
swap_map, and hit in an unused 4M region), the required PDE update would
never get flushed, causing an infinite page fault loop.
This bug affects any paravirt-ops backend which uses lazy updates, I
believe that makes it a bug in Xen, VMI and lguest.  It only happens on
LOWMEM kernels.
Touching vmalloc memory in the middle of a lazy mode update can generate a
kernel PDE update, which must be flushed immediately.  The fix is to leave
lazy mode when doing a vmalloc sync.
