Hi
I had the same messages about unknown PHY transceivers and very poor 
transfer rates. I figured that all but one of the transceivers had the 
status bit MII_STAT_FAULT set. Selecting that one solved my problems.
I posted this and the patch already a while ago but didn't get any 
response. It would be nice if a few people could check whether this 
fixes/breaks it for them.
I just checked it with 2.6.6-rc3 and the problem is still there and gets 
solved by the attached patch.
