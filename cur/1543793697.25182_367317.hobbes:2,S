What do you mean by cooperative ? that the code should be modified to
cooperate with a checkpoint/restart tool ? do you have something else in mind ?

Files are definitely very difficult to handle efficiently but there are
ways to deal with them. One way is not to deal with them at all and let the
application organize its data in such a way that we don't have to
checkpoint the file system, share storage is one solution, copying files
from a checkpointed node to another node is an other. It can be very
inefficient but it works.
But, I agree with you, we don't want to checkpoint a filesystem.

well, if the file is available, lseek() should do the job. Pipes are more
difficult to handle than regular files in fact.

network connections are indeed very tricky. The network code is very
complex, very large, plenty of protocols to handle but it can be done for
TCP/IP by blocking the traffic, checkpointing the data and checkpointing
the PCBs. But tell me more, what are the main issues for you ?
Private interconnect are a challenge.

Well, they have to be constrained in a known set of processes, or a
container, to make sure we are not checkpointing a moving target.

Oh yes, the UNIX API is very large but in checkpoint/restart we care more
about implementation. This can be tricky.

Indeed !
We need an isolation mecanism to make sure we control the boundaries of an
application. We don't want any leaks when we initiate a checkpoint.

We do need to reach a quiescience point. a SIGSTOP is enough or a container
wide schedule(), a la software suspend. But no more.

Well, what if that register holds a virtualized pid, this is no more an
issue, nop ?

HPC industry is indeed an obvious target.
However, we have successfully checkpinted desktop applications like
openoffice, thunderbird, mozilla, emacs, etc. We are still working on pty
in order to migrate terminals. We think in can also be useful in that area
and others.

hmm, didn't get your point here ? can you elaborate ?

Well, let's say that we want to present this one step after the other and
try to have each step brings some interesting value to the linux kernel.
Process aggregation is the first big step, other projects have shown
interest in this area, PAGG for instance. Isolation is another. The
virtualization step could be thought as dedicated to checkpoint/restart but
we're pretty sure it should help some projects like vserser that need to
virtualize some ancestor pid. On that subject, having a way to manage
cluster wide pids could be useful to HPC batch managers.

Well, we've already migrated some pretty ugly applications, database
engines, without modifying them :)
