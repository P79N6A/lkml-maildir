I don't see it - w83627hf registers w83627hf_driver via i2c_isa_add_driver,
which does not have any probe, remove or shutdown methods.  Moreover,
i2c_isa_add_driver doesn't set any of these methods.  So how can:
        if ((drv->bus->probe && drv->probe) ||
            (drv->bus->remove && drv->remove) ||
            (drv->bus->shutdown && drv->shutdown)) {
be true?  Local distro modifications maybe?

If driver->bus->{probe,remove,shutdown} are set, the driver model will
_not_ call driver->{probe,remove,shutdown} itself.  Hence, if both
contain pointers then it's highly likely the driver will not work.
Not reporting these instances will lead to users complaining "my
driver doesn't work" and then a headache for someone to work out
why - since nothing obvious will have changed.
