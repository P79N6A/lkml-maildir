I've never done IPSec, but plain use of 2.4.18-3 does work with Red Hat
7.1. Note that you'll need to either satisfy the dependencies by
upgrading some packages from Red Hat 7.3, or use --nodeps. Both work in
my experiences.
However, note that:
+ 2.4.18-3 has a data corruption bug with ext3 on SMP systems, fixed in
  2.4.18-4.
+ 2.4.18-4 (and -3) has weird NFS problems which are fixed in 2.4.18-5
+ 2.4.18-[345] have security problems which are fixed in 2.4.18-10
  (By the way, does anyone know if new 2.4.9-xx or 2.2.xx kernels are
  coming from Red Hat to fix these holes for those releases? Or have
  earlier Red Hat kernels (and releases) just been abandoned? Or are
  they just not affected?)
