Patches apply to kernel sources as downloaded from kernel.org, not to
kernel sources heavily patched by RedHat, and guess which kernel you are
trying to add the patch to ...
BTW: I'm sure the documentation that was pointed out to you by Jesper also
said this.
You'll have to download a 'vanilla' kernel without RedHat patches if you
want to apply a 'vanilla' patch to it. Vanilla in this context means 'as
downloaded from kernel.org', the official sources without patches by
RedHat or others.
Hope this helps,
Jurriaan
