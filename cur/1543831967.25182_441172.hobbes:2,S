Read the papers on the subject. If I can get copies of the unencrypted
data I can use those to make fake fingers. 
A finger print is personal data, arguably sensitive personal data. That
means there are lots of duties to store it securely. It is also very
hard to revoke a fingerprint so theft of data is highly problematic as
it will allow me to generate fake fingers. Theft of encrypted data might
allow replay attacks on one PC. Big deal.
