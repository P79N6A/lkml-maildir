Subject: little TCP checksum bug?

Hi,
After playing with malicious TCP-packet I found out
that in certain cases the kernel will reply with a wrong
TCP-checksum set. This has only been tested against 2.2.19
and 2.4.5!

I don't think this will become a big problem, while most
people are running ipchains/iptables and/or some sort of
IDS's so those packets won't come through.
(Note that this has been tested on a standalone pc, while (of course)
128.0.0.1 didn't exist and no firewall)
If one want to test this behaviour you can download a little
