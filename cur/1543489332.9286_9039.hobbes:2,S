Hello!
I am running Linux with 2.0.35 kernel. There are a lot of network
traffic (mail, http etc.). Last time I got a lot of messages:
"kernel: Couldn't get a free page...". After that my Linux box hangs up.
Could you tell me where could be a problem and how can I solve it?
#cat /proc/sys/vm/freepages

Regards,
Aleksandrs.
