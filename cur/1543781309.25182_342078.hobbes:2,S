I _am_ using the new subsystem interface (->mark_offset) to catch up with lost
ticks. Only I don't think it is that good at catching up the lost ticks if we
skip ticks for few seconds in a stretch. For ex: I am observing drift (time
slows down) when skipping ticks for upto 5 seconds on a 699MHz P3 SMP hardware.
Both TSC and ACPI pm timer give this drift. I am investigating this and will
post an update as soon as I get more information.
