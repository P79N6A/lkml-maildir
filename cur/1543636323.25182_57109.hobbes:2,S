It wasn't a very good idea in the first place.  Forgot to take
the new lock over in the updaters of f_pos.
And it's attempting to cater for a buggy application on a 32-bit
machine, SMP, where the fd is shared.  It's hard to justify
putting any locking in lseek for that.  (Then again, people
should use pread() more..)
Except for readdir().  Now, why are we taking i_sem for lseek/readdir
exclusion and not a per-file lock?
