What downsides? I must admit I do not understand your answer here.
Let me stay on the subject of converting large stack onjects
to kmalloc()ed ones, without reference to current state
of code in a particular module.
Basically, these objects are local to function. We do not
introduce struct as an 'object'. It merely aggregates
all locals we decided to move to kmalloc space,
only because it's easier that way to allocate and reference
all of them in C.
Thus, even if there are many functions with similar
set of locals, it makes little sense to declare common struct.
IOW, I wouldn't do this:
struct big {
	large_t	large;
	huge_t huge;
};
int f() {
	struct big *local;
	local = kmalloc(sizeof(big),...);
	...
}
int g() {
	struct big *local;
	local = kmalloc(sizeof(big),...);
	...
}
For one, what will happen when you will need to add
another local in one function only?
Instead, I'd do it like I described in previous mail:
int f() {
	struct {
		large_t	large;
		huge_t huge;
	} *local;
	local = kmalloc(sizeof(*local),...);
	...
}
int g() {
	struct {
		large_t	large;
		huge_t huge;
	} *local;
	local = kmalloc(sizeof(*local),...);
	...
}
