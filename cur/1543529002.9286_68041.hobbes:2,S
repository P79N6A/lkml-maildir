We should have 64 bits here. Directory offsets need not be actual
offsets into a linear directory file. The extra bits will be useful for
filesystems with complex directories. Consider what the offset means
for a B-tree directory or worse.
Since you don't really need a system call though, don't bother.
BTW, if you were to add a new system call, do it right. Doing the
job right means using a very general interface that has low kernel
overhead. Glibc is not supposed to dictate kernel interfaces.
