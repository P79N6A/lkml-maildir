Hmmm...  And cpu_clock() is not in 2.6.22, so must appear in some later
release.  Which means that the rate of API change in this area is a
bit high, so I should avoid it like the plague.  Therefore, I should
look for some other convenient source of entropy.
One convenient source would the per-CPU statistics that rcutorture
maintains.  Of course, a given CPU's RNG is nearly in lock-step with
its own statistics, but not with the adjacent CPU's statistics...
I will send a patch.
						Thanx, Paul
