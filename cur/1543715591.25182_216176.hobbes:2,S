Using sata_sil on sii3112A on 2.6.5-rc2 (sorry a bit old, will update
but I dont think there are any changes to the driver) I got an error:
ata1: DMA timeout, stat 0x0
ATA: abnormal status 0xD8 on port 0xF8807087
scsi0: ERROR on channel 0, id 0, lun 0, CDB: 0x2a 00 17 9b d9 80 00 00

Current sda: sense = 70  3

end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 396089728
ATA: abnormal status 0xD8 on port 0xF8807087
ATA: abnormal status 0xD8 on port 0xF8807087
ATA: abnormal status 0xD8 on port 0xF8807087
Then all accesses to the drive got stuck in D state.
I think the disk has bad sectors or other faults - had read errors
earlier, but this is the first bad disk I have had that has had problems
recovering. Could I have hit the state that requires the watchdog?
