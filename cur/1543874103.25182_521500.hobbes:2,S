I have been asking this myself on nearly every one of my patches since
you announced the new stack. :-)
The skb change here, which I wanted to do for some time, was prompted by
/a/ trouble with skb lock annotations when lockdep went mainline and /b/
a very recent bug report 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8216
which first read like -ENOBUG but then motivated me to clean up
hpsb_packet a bit and also pointed me to a raw1394 bug.  (Besides, most
of the cleanup patches which I came up with were meant to pave the way
for actual bug fixes.  I'm just extremely slow with following up with
the latter.)
