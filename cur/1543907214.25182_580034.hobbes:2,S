Actually, it's *allowed* to do a warm reset.  Not required.
And not all PCI devices will do such a reset.   Some of them
will return to D0_initialized ... not D0_uninitialized (where
uninitialized means "did the reset").
It's D3_cold where a (powerup) reset is *required*.
A common example would be a USB host controller.  If one of
those did a warm reset it'd trash all the connection state
which was carefully retained during sleep ... and there'd be
no point to supporting D3_hot rather than D3_cold.
As a rule of thumb, it's probably safe to assume that if
a device can generate wakeup events, it probably doesn't
trash all of its state when it resumes from D3_hot.
Of course, if it can generate wakeup events from D3_cold,
the difference between Vaux and Vcc power wells comes into
play.  The Vaux powered bits will retain state, while the
stuff powered by Vcc gets a powerup reset.
If it can't generate wakeup events, a PCI device has no
particular need to retain state after D3.  Implementors
can choose whichever is most convenient.
