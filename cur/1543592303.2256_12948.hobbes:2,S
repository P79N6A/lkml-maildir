We have comments in the code that state how j0 is build, and R0/S0
come from some expansion:
 * Bessel function of the first and second kinds of order zero.
 * Method -- j0(x):
 *	1. For tiny x, we use j0(x) = 1 - x^2/4 + x^4/64 - ...
 *	2. Reduce x to |x| since j0(x)=j0(-x),  and
 *	   for x in (0,2)
 *		j0(x) = 1-z/4+ z^2*R0/S0,  where z = x*x;
 *	   (precision:  |j0-1+z/4-z^2R0/S0 |<2**-63.67 )
