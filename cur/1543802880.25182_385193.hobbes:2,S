Thanks, I do understand your objection. In the document file describing 
the feature
I did mention the bit inversion as a source for confusion. However, I 
found the
alternatives to be even more confusing. I went back to the original 
discussion of
unshare interface on lkml in August of 2000 and in one of the posts 
Linus indicated
that it makes sense for unshare(CLONE_FILES) to undo the sharing done by
clone(CLONE_FILES). So I stuck with what I had in the patch posted in mid
December.
