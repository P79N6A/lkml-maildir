My previous post details the problem with KDE I had on 2.6.9-rc1, 
2.6.9-rc1-mm1 fixed that.
I get hangs with 2.6.9-rc1-mm1 if ACPI or APM are enabled. I haven't 
tried console=ttyS1 to see if there is an oops, but from previous 
experiences also posted, they are probably being generated.
One other problem is that trying to rebuild a 2.6.9-rc1-mm1 kernel under 
2.6.9-rc1-mm1 fails, once as shown below and once elsewhere in fs/. I 
have to boot 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 in order to build 2.6.9-rc1-mm1. Asus A7N8X-E 
nForce2 chipset, Version: ASUS A7N8X-E Deluxe ACPI BIOS Rev 1011, SuSE 
9.1. Upgrading to 1012 shortly.
fs/.tmp_open.o: could not read symbols: File truncated
make[1]: *** [fs/open.o] Error 1
make: *** [fs] Error 2
