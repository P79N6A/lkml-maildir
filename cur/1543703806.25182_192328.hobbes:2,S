Looks OK to me.
But it does make one wonder whether we'll soon see standalone patches for
scsi_printk(), pci_bridge_printk(), random_other_subsystem_printk(), ...?
Or is it intended that the backend logging code will be implemented mainly
in terms of the `struct device'?  So netdev_printk() will be a bit of
netdev-specific boilerplate which then calls into a more generic
device_printk()?
