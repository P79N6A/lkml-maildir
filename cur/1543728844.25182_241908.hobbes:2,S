That's why it works right now without the assign_resource. The BIOS has
already set everything up.

The code that accesses the ROM runs very early, before anything else is
loaded. The only conflict I can think of is from the on-board BIOS of a
disk cotroller with partial decoding. But I'm not sure if a care like
that exists.
If a card like this exists, I need to make the code use the BIOS SHADOW
copy of the ROM.

The copy is triggered manually by the device driver with partial
decoding. When the driver loads loads and it is safe to access the ROM,
call pci_map_rom_copy() this will trigger the copy. Alternatively it
can call pci_rom_remove() which will remove the rom sysfs attribute.
Normal hardware needs to do nothing. If a normal device driver wants to
access the ROM call pci_map_rom(). This will automatically return the
actual ROM or the BIOS shadow copy as needed.
There are two times the ROM can get copied:
1) manually when a driver knows it has partial PCI decoding and calls
pci_map_rom_copy()
2) By the system BIOS. PC system BIOS' automatically shadow all of the
roms located from C0000 to 1000000 into RAM. If this copy exists I use
it.
The system shadow copy is one of the main motivators for this code. On
some laptop the system and video ROMs are compressed. On these systems
the boot ROM decompresses these ROM into the shadow memory at
C0000-100000.
