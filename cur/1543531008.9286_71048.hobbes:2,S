i am crying because THE TULIP *DRIVER* REALLY *IS* BROKEN.
anything 0.91g and later WILL *NOT* WORK with tulip 21041.
this has nothing to do with any kernel interface changes, pci scanning
or embedding in the kernel.  0.91g just plain doesn't work with my
card while order revisions do.  0.91g compiles just fine.  the kernel
runs fine.  it's not a kernel stability issue.  it's a broken driver
issue.  the card doesn't work with this driver.
jeff garzik is actively looking into it.  i have no idea what donald
becker is doing about it.  afaict this is why jeff is now the
maintainer.  jeff is actually maintaining it by entertaining bug
reports.
