Unfortunately the person who did write this has no clue on the Copyright law :-(
The Copyright law is _very_ explicit about the fact that Authors that do minor
contributions have no right to influence the license or the way of publishing.
It is obvious that SuSE versions of cdrecord impact the original authors' 
reputations which is prohibited by the GPL.
