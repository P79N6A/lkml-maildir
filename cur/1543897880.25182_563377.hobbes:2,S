Unfortunately setting the thread to real time priority makes
throughput slightly worse.  Instead of floating around 35MB/s the
resync speed is stuck around 30MB/s:
[ iop-adma: hi-prio workqueue based callbacks ]
iq81340mc:~# cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [raid0] [raid1] [raid10] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4]
md0 : active raid5 sdd[4] sdc[2] sdb[1] sda[0]
      468872448 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [4/3] [UUU_]
      [>....................]  recovery =  3.9% (6107424/156290816)
finish=84.9min speed=29448K/sec
The iop-adma tasklet cleans up any completed descriptors and in the
process calls any attached callbacks.  For the raid5 resync case the
callback is simply:
static void ops_complete_check(void *stripe_head_ref)
{
        struct stripe_head *sh = stripe_head_ref;
        int pd_idx = sh->pd_idx;
        pr_debug("%s: stripe %llu\n", __FUNCTION__,
                (unsigned long long)sh->sector);
        if (test_and_clear_bit(STRIPE_OP_MOD_DMA_CHECK, &sh->ops.pending) &&
                sh->ops.zero_sum_result == 0)
                set_bit(R5_UPTODATE, &sh->dev[pd_idx].flags);
        set_bit(STRIPE_OP_CHECK, &sh->ops.complete);
        set_bit(STRIPE_HANDLE, &sh->state);
        release_stripe(sh);
}
