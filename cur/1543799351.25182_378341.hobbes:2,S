Well practically, we're never bug free.  What happens is that as the
tree stabilises, the arrival rate of the critical bugs increases fairly
exponentially.  I measure this interval to be about 6 days now, so if
you release a kernel in the next six days I won't have to run around
like a mad thing trying to delay the kernel so I can QA and submit the
bug fix, whatever it is.
Of course, if you want to wait for all the critical bug fixes, there'll
be one in six days ... then twelve days after that ... then twenty
four ...
