Yes, that's a bug that needs fixing

Ok, I need to check our 2.4 repository.

I don't think so. The problem starts with an invalid stack pointer,
masking bit 2^31 from %r15 doesn't make it valid. It's the subtraction
of sizeof(sigframe) that makes the value in %r15 negative / sets the
high order bit. The content of register %r15 for normal program
execution is an address without bit 2^31, both in kernel and user space.
While it is true that bit 2^31 gets ignored by the processor in 31 bit
mode, nobody should set the bit in %r15. The address with the bit set
isn't a valid stack address anymore. A process that deliberatly set
the bit deserves to get killed for it, the important things is that the
kernel doesn't get into trouble because of it.
blue skies,
