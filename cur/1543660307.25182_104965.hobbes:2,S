ugh.

Actually, I rather don't like the practice of:
	*errp = -EFOO;
	<200 lines of code>
	if (something_bad)
		goto out;
And lo, both ext2_new_block() and ext3_new_block() have additional
bugs, due mainly to this dubious optimisation.
I'll change them to the very straightforward
	if (something_bad) {
		*errp = -EFOO;
		goto out;
	}
Thanks.
