Then you'll need to change the physical structure of

Automatic scaling of readahead window and possibly more agressive
drop-behind could help your system load.
Could you give me a few (heavy load) lines of 'vmstat 5' output
so we have an idea of what kind of system load we're facing, and
the active/inactive memory lines from /proc/meminfo ?

Indeed, something is going wrong ;)
Lets find out exactly what so we can iron out this bug
properly.
