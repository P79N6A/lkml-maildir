Yeah and to simplify things for future changes.  In this patch, the
only actual unification is in __per_cpu_offset initialization but the
lack of unification is partly due to the usage of pda and differences
in initialization sequence, which again couldn't be unified because
percpu handling was different, so it's a tied knot and this patch
helps untangling it.  Also, with cpualloc (or whatever) scheduled, I
think it's better to have two percpu models, up and smp, even if it
costs 49 more lines.

And we seem to be stuck with it if we want to keep compatibility with
compilers.  :-(

I thought about removing all explicit per_cpu__ prefixes with
per_cpu_var() but the usage seemed prevalent so left it alone.  Why
remove it BTW?
Thanks.
