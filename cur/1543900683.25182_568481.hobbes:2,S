devices that have not been touches don't need to be quiesced or put into a 
low-power state, they are still waiting to be initialized. so as long as 
the device initialization can be done from the low-power or quiesced state 
things will work just fine.

why do you assume that it will take 10 seconds to boot the new kernel? 
linuxbiosdoes it in <2 seconds, someone else posted on this thread <5 
seconds

the complexity of the freezer freezing some things, but not other things 
keeps getting t wrong and many people can't think of any algorithm that 
will always get it right. This approach bypasses the entire problem 
makeing it much simpler conceptually, even though there are a few more 
parts involved.
