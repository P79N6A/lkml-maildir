Where? I don't ever recall seeing something that defines Gcc's behaviour
with volatile on different architectures.
I know on some architectures gcc generates different instructions
for volatile accesses (e.g. load acquire/store release on IA64); I'd
be pleasently surprised if gcc's behaviour was consistent accross
architectures.
