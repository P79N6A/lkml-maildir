I do a test pull and build of net-2.6 into Linus's current tree
before I send Linus a pull request.
If any non-trivial merges are necessary, which hasn't happened yet at
all, I would then do a merge into my net-2.6 tree and resolve the
conflicts.
There is no reason for someone downstream of net-2.6 to do this.
