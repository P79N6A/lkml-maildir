Subject: [PATCH] usb/serial/mos7840: fix cast
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/1/46

Debug code in mos7840 emits the following warnings on 64-bit:
drivers/usb/serial/mos7840.c: In function ‘mos7840_open’:
drivers/usb/serial/mos7840.c:1091: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
drivers/usb/serial/mos7840.c:1091: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
drivers/usb/serial/mos7840.c:1091: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
Solution:  Don't assume pointers are 32-bit.  The easy solution actually
cleans up the code:  "%p" (pointer) permits us to eliminate the casts,
and print correct debug information on 64-bit.
