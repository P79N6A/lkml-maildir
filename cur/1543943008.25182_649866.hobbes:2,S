Subject: [GIT PATCH] driver core fixes against 2.6.24-git
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/7/379

Here's 3 patches against your current git tree that fix some more
problems that have cropped up:
	- whole_disk attribute file causes oopses when read from.
	- the firmware class name change broke Dell machines that were
	  working just fine.
	- we shouldn't BUG on a programming error in sysfs by the
	  caller, do a WARN_ON instead.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
