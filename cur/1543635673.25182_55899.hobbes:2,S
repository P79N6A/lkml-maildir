As for me,
$ arch
i686
$ uname -r
2.4.19-pre10-ac2
$ uptime
  6:51pm  up 36 days, 19:14, 19 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
(config: p2, 2 ide controllers, raid0, 2 network adapters)
--
$ arch 
sparc
$ uname -r
2.4.19-pre10
$ uptime
  6:51pm  up 38 days,  8:46,  7 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.00
(config: smp ss10, scsi, raid0, 1 network adapter)
The latter is with my dynamic-nocache patch included.
