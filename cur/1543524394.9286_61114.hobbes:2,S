 Try IDA Free Version
ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/disasm/ida37fw.zip
 - very good. Might run under DosEMU. Allows you to interactively change
function
names, whether a region is treated as code/data etc.
There is also a commercial verion at

 Found these at

  PCITree 
http://home.t-online.de/home/michael_reusch/
 Shows Config Space, IO and memory regions. Also allows you to edit
memory/IO/config space. Be careful this could crash your system :-)
  PCIView 
http://www.bluewatersystems.com/downloads/pciview.html
 NT only, shows Configuration Space only.
