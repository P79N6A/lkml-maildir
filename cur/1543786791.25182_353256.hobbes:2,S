ok so this brings the question: how does naming it DRM_ARRAY_SIZE make
it more portable than naming it ARRAY_SIZE?
If *BSD doesn't have ARRAY_SIZE, then surely naming it ARRAY_SIZE is
easy for them to provide (after all they need to provide it already just
called DRM_ARRAY_SIZE); if they have ARRAY_SIZE... then I assume it has
the exact same semantics....
