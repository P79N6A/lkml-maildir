It does child runs first by design in staircase. You don't need any more.

Well duh... disable interactivity and interactivity is bad. What's the 
problem? It's not meant to be used on a desktop in that way.

Why? A single user desktop is hardly needing extremely accurate cpu 
distribution... we see that already in 2.6.

Hmm? a minor mouse freeze with a _test_ starvation program is not 
starvation; nor is it an interactivity problem. Yours is the first complaint 
about interactivity during i/o.

-20 is 40 rr intervals. 0 is 20 rr intervals. +19 is 1 rr interval. 
Seems to me the cpu distribution is working our absolutely perfectly as 
designed.
Why is the only critic of this the person with a competing design? Does 
anyone else object to these things? I certainly dont feel objective enough 
to criticise yours.
