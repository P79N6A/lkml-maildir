Not as yet. As I indicated I can only test the problem at a remote site 
and I don't get much time to look at it.

I agree, it can't be the case. To prove that I hadn't just made a 
mistake, I transplanted the whole usb branch and it still failed. This 
really points to the user app - which is complex and I haven't got to 
the bottom of it. It's a multi-threaded library and I see it's doing 
some sort of packet requeuing based on a timer. I can't see what has 
changed but I am guessing it's a kernel timing issue. It would explain 
everything.

I think the usb is red herring - sorry about that. BTW, I see you have 
cc'd Ian (hi Ian). By coincidence we are using an MEV usb device.
