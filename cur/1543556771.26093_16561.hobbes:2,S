 Well, I expect wasting a descriptor and a page of memory for the purpose
of a TSS is not a big problem.

 You might handle the stack fault with a task gate, actually, but I'm not
sure it's worth the hassle.  Handling just the double fault should be
sufficient.

 Yep.  An MCE is an abort like a double-fault, so the CPU state might be
corrupted (by definition -- I have no idea whether it really happens).
