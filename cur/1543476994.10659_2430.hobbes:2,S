The problem with exceptions (especially in the kernel):
1 - Error probably not handled locally in function, meaning the function is
relying on some higher level code to take care of the exceptions.
2 - Hampers readability as another programmer will find it difficult to read
the function and understand how it all works since the error handling may be
missing as it is suppose to be implemented at a higher level.
3 - Exceptions also adds overhead, perhaps not speedwise, but definately
bloatwise.
4 - Exceptions are one way, no way to continue executing if the problem was
resolved.
5 - Exception calls would be quite common as "errors" occur often in the
kernel.

The STL is messy.  The syntax is atrocious and cryptic and error messages
are extremly cryptic due to the teplatization.  Besides to even use the STL
you would have to reimplement it as the kernel cannot call an external
library.  The simplier, cleaner, more readable, safer, maintainable, and
more object oriented approach is to create classes that take care of
whatever needs to be taken care of.  Furthermore, some algorithms need not
be implemented in a class, especially if they fit nicely within a regular
function.

Oh well, there goes my plans to experiment with that new feature.
