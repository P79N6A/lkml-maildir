Leaving aside the $600K/year or so it would cost us to do that...

And how does the CVS gateway not provide this today?  We effectively
have exactly what you are describing.  And long ago I offered what I
called the tarball + patch server with an open source client for all
trees on bkbits.net - here it is:

If people had stopped flaming long enough to look at that it would 
be installed on bkbits today and any repo hosted there would have an
automatic real-time gateway with no license problems.  Heck, we could
even export the changeset comments into ChangeLog as Keith suggested
here: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/12/14/92
 .  
People didn't seem interested and I came with the conclusion, rightly or
wrongly, that the vast majority of the people who did real work didn't
care about the license and the noisy people just wanted to pick a fight.
If I was wrong and this is valuable I can look into putting it up on
bkbits.net.
