Subject: How to structure an SPI UART driver?

I'm looking for a little advice on writing a driver for the Phillips
sc16is752 SPI UART chip. I've written drivers before but I'm having a
problem with this one. Since this driver is both an SPI driver and a
UART driver I'm unclear on whether it should register with
spi_register_driver() or uart_register_driver(), or both, or do
something completely different. I'm not clear on how to play nicely
with both subsystems.
Any hints?
Cheers,
Zik
