I'm actually trying to get the boehm one up, but it keeps setting PaX
off for some odd reason.  I'd intended to have some test data right
about now. . . . >/  Firefox, gimp, hell vim can't run with boehm
LD_PRELOAD to redirect malloc().  Nano can.  A simple tester can.
fortune can't.  BASH doesn't seem to like it.
It's only hypothetical until I prove or disprove it; and I'm not afraid
to do either.
