Drivers might want to use this field without having to add protective 
"#ifdef CONFIG_PM_SLEEP" lines.  You can change it to a single-bit 
bitfield and place it adjacent to can_wakeup.

Add a stack dump?  When this isn't a race, it's the kind of bug we want
to fix.

It's not clear that we want to have this check.  It would cause
problems if the device ordering got mixed up by device_move(), which is
pretty much the only way it could be triggered.
If you do want to leave it in, add a stack dump (and perhaps make it 
not return an error).  This would help force people to figure out safe 
ways to use device_move().

Extra ';'.
