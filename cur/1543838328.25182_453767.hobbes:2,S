Assalam-o-Alaikum
I want to solicit your attention in receiving funds 
on my behalf.
The purpose of contacting you is because you live in a 
country with a stable economy where one can invest.
On receipt of your 
response, I will send you full details and more information about 
myself and the funds.
Thank you.
Abdullah Gh Al-qassab
