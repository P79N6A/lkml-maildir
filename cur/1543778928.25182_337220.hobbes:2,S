Yes, sure. I wanted to sync more early, but I had some trouble with 
cogito. Now things settled a bit, so I'll start with regular updates.
Note that most of lines are from new Sparc and ARM drivers. Other changes 
are mostly small bugfixes, cleanups and new hardware ID additions. The all 
changes goes through all ALSA developers (our CVS server sends us whole 
diffs back), so all of them review/verify new code and can fix it ASAP. It 
works quite well.
