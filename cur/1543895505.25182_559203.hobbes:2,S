do you realize that redhat uses checksums or signatures to check the 
validity of their CD's?
try to burn a redhat image with the -pad option which adds a chunk of 0's 
to the end of the image and try to boot it.
I seriously doubt if redhat tells you how to how to generate such a 
checksum/signature.
in addition to the problem that Linus points out about being unable to 
change the contents of the write-only CD this would seem to conflict with 
what you are claiming the GPL is supposed to allow.
