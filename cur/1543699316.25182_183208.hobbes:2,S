Yep, I noticed already, that there's no release method at all:-)) I'm just
adapting the code to an ARM platform (actually, the patch already exists
and already works), and, no, we don't really need to unload it, but, just
thought, wasn't quite clean... But, well, it's probably not going to
change in 2.4. Not that it was very needed:-)
Thanks
