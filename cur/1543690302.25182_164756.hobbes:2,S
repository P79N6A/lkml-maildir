It is because the interface is perfectly enough. You still can
implement zero-copy local transfers for pipes for read and write
calls.
And for small amounts, where it is impossible to do zero-copy does not
bring noticable advantages (as was already mentioned by Alan).

If it is possible, why new user-side interface?
