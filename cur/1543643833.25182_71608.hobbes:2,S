Game over. There is no PC technology that doesn't have some problems

The Geode aka Cyrix MediaGx TSC problems are not in the TSC but in the
PIT emulation in the chipset. That problem isnt present on the 5530 and
later chipsets. So its a long buried problem. You might also want to
look at the VIA Eden based boards if its got to be embedded (fanless
550MHz)
