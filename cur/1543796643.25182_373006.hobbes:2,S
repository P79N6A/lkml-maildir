Yes, and everyone implements his own softmac (this is the third one I
know about). I tried to put all of these efforts together (google
through the netdev archives) and wrote many patches.

And authors of rtl8180 did it too. And authors of adm8211 too.

This is what I'm doing last two months. But it's not so easy to clean it
up and it seems that nobody else is interested. But it has all of the
features you need (except active scanning) - this is the reason I
stopped to work on improving current in-kernel 802.11 code and focused
on Devicescape's code. It is several years beyond the state that current
code is at now. And it is not an advertisement, it is a fact.
