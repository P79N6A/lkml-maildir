Hi Sangtae,
Thanks for joining this discussion -- it's good to a CUBIC author and 
expert here!

Yes, this is also what I had thought.
In the graph that we posted, the two machines are connected by an ethernet 
crossover cable.  The total RTT of the two machines is probably AT MOST a 
couple of hundred microseconds.  Typically it takes 20 or 30 microseconds 
to get the first packet out the NIC.  Travel across the wire is a few 
nanoseconds.  Then getting the packet into the receiving NIC might be 
another 20 or 30 microseconds.  The ACK should fly back in about the same 
time.

We are going to double-check this (we did the broadcom testing about two 
months ago). Carsten is going to re-run the broadcomm experiments later 
today and will then post the results.
You can see results from some testing on crossover-cable wired systems 
with broadcomm NICs, that I did about 2 years ago, here:
http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/beowulf/nemo/design/SMC_8508T_Performance.html
You'll notice that total TCP throughput on the crossover cable was about 
220 MB/sec.  With TCP overhead this is very close to 2Gb/s.

Carsten will post these in the next few hours.  If you want to simplify 
further, you can even take away the gig switch and just use a crossover 
cable.

Carsten will post all the sysctl and ethtool parameters shortly.
Thanks again for chiming in. I am sure that with help from you, Jesse, and 
Rick, we can figure out what is going on here, and get it fixed.
Cheers,
