A patch to upgrade PlugSched-5.0 to PlugSched-5.1 (containing ingosched, 
nicksched, staircase, spa_no_frills and zaphod CPU schedulers) against a 
2.6.11 kernel is available for download from:
<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/plugsched-5.0-to-5.1-for-2.6.11.patch?download>
A patch of PlugSched-5.1 for 2.6.12-rc5 is at:
<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/plugsched-5.1-for-2.6.12-rc5.patch?download>
and for 2.6.12-rc5-mm2 at:
<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/plugsched-5.1-for-2.6.12-rc5-mm2.patch?download>
Version 5.1 contains bug fixes for spa_no_frills and zaphod, upgrade of 
staircase to version 11.2 and the recent changes Con Kolivas's "nice" 
aware load balancing patch.
Very Brief Documentation:
You can select a default scheduler at kernel build time.  If you wish to 
boot with a scheduler other than the default it can be selected at boot 
time by adding:
cpusched=<scheduler>
to the boot command line where <scheduler> is one of: ingosched, 
nicksched, staircase, spa_no_frills or zaphod.  If you don't change the 
default when you build the kernel the default scheduler will be 
ingosched (which is the normal scheduler).
The scheduler in force on a running system can be determined by the 
contents of:
/proc/scheduler
Control parameters for the scheduler can be read/set via files in:
/sys/cpusched/<scheduler>/
