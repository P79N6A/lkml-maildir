Note that this is likely to be a side effect of running
completely out of swap, because that means many of the
"obvious candidates" of what to swap out cannot be swapped
out, meaning we have to scan more pages until we find
something which already has swap backing.
Before you draw conclusions like the one above, please test
again with more swap.

Rik
