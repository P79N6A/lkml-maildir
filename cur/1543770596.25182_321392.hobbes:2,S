Um, that sounds 100% backwards.  Starting around 2.6.8 the latency (as
measured by the smallest usable jack buffer size) improved drastically
with each release.  Check the linux-audio-user or linux-audio-dev
archives, many JACK users report that 2.6.10 or 2.6.11 is the first
mainline kernel that gives acceptable performance at all.  In fact,
starting around 2.6.11 some pro audio users have been switching back
from PREEMPT_RT to mainline as a result.
