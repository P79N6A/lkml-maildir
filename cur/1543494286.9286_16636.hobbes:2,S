Subject: [PATCH] bugs in 2.2.2-7 drivers/char/pc_keyb.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Problem: since kernel 2.2.2, the Synaptics touchpad configurer tpconfig
has not worked on my system (Digital Hinote Ultra 2000). It times out
waiting for an ack from the mouse. (And various more exotic things
happen on the second etc. attempts.)
Suggested analysis: the keyboard and mouse handler 
linux/drivers/char/pc_keyb.c  is broken. In 2.2.2, C. Scott Ananian
made various changes to fix the problem that mouse ACKs, generated from
commands sent during psaux open(), were being passed to user programs.
However, there is (I believe) a deeper problem, revealed by Scott's
fix. Namely, when a command is sent to the mouse, the driver should 
wait for the ACK before writing another command byte; otherwise the ACK
may be lost. The pre-2.2.2 driver failed to do this, but because it also
failed to intercept its own ACKs, tpconfig did get the ACKs it was expecting.
Proposed fix: when writing a command byte to the mouse in the routines
aux_write_dev and aux_write_ack, the driver should wait until any pending
ACK has been received. This is achieved by an mdelay loop inside the spinlock;
in practice, the loop is only executed once, but a timeout of 5 is implemented.
Questions: does this analysis and fix seem plausible? (It works for me,
so I'm happy.)
