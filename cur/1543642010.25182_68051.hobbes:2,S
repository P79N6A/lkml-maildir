But you have to be specific about why not. I've responded to the
particular objections so far.

Yes, thanks, I know.

My simple suggestion is not to cache. I am of the opinion that in
principle that solves all coherency problems, since there would be no
stored state that needs to "cohere". The question is how to identify
and remove the state that is currently cached.
As to journal replay, there will be no journalling - if it breaks it
breaks and somebody (fsck) can go fix it. I don't want to get anywhere
near complicated.

(Puhleeese!)
We already know that we can have a perfectly fine and arbitrary
shared file system, shared only at the block level if we 
  1) permit no new dirs or files to be made (disable O_CREAT or something
     like)
  2) do all r/w on files with O_DIRECT
  3) do file extensions via a new generic VFS "reserve" operation
  4) have shared mutexes on all vfs op, implemented by passing
     down a special "tag" request to the block layer.
  5) maintain read+write order at the shared resource.
I have already implemented 2,4,5.
The question is how to extend the range of useful operations. For the
moment I would be happy simply to go ahead and implement 1) and 3),
while taking serious strong advice on what to do about directories.
