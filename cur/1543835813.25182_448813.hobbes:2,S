Sorry, you cannot do this.  I already merged this patch into -mm, and
followed that up with two bugfix patches, both of which you were copied on.
Now you're sending out the original patch, without the bugfixes which
Adrian and I prepared.
If you think these patches should be merged into 2.6.18 at this late a
stage, please give reasons and if they're agreeable I can send it all to
Linus.  But sending out known-buggy stuff which has already been fixed
doesn't help anyone.
Also, please don't use filenames as patch descriptions.  See section 2 of
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt.
Thanks.
