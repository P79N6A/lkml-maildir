I just test rt6 it in my problematic VIA Board with one PENTIUM D (DUAL)
1. don't apply cleaning to 2.16.18.1 (on sparc arch )
2. I usual boot with notsc (because without it give me many lost time
tickets)
    I try 2.16.18.1-rt6 without notsc and freeze on boot. 
    I try with notsc and says 
        Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
        Looks stable and don't show any lost timer ticket on dmesg.
But I want also work with Nvidia dri which is a close drive from NVIDIA.
I install that drive and I enable DRI, After a few minutes I got a
spontaneous reboot.
I will keep testing without nvidia close source.
And I like to know if this rt6 patch make this new clocksource (acpi_pm)
or just found it and use it ? 
cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource
acpi_pm jiffies
cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
acpi_pm
Thanks,
