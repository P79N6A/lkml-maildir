Using yield() to wait for a precisely defined event (clear_inode()
finishing) doesn't seem like a very good idea.  Especially, since
Artem's patch will probably make it trigger more often.
How about this (totally untested) patch?  Even if I_LOCK is not set
initially, wake_up_inode() should do the right thing and wake up the
waiting task after clear_inode().  It shouldn't cause spurious
wakeups, since there should be no other reference to the inode.
