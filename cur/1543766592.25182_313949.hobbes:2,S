    Andrew> How does the driver detect process exit?
I already answered earlier but just to be clear: registration goes
through a character device, and all regions are cleaned up in the
->release() of that device.
I don't currently have any code accounting against RLIMIT_MEMLOCK or
testing CAP_FOO, but I have no problem adding whatever is thought
appropriate.  Userspace also has control over the permissions and
owner/group of the /dev node.
