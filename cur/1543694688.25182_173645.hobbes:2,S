| ./include/asm-i386/mach-default/irq_vectors.h
| ./include/asm-i386/mach-visws/irq_vectors.h
| ./include/asm-i386/mach-pc9800/irq_vectors.h
| ./include/asm-i386/mach-voyager/irq_vectors.h

| Any ideas ????
You are building a module outside of the kernel tree?
Use a Makefile in the form that is documented in
linux/Documentation/kbuild/{modules,makefiles}.txt
and it will find that file and work.
