Yes, hence the reason that a larger pipe / dynamic pipe wasn't even
attempted yet. In the tests I did, manually increasing the pipe size
yielded no noticable benefits.
Conceptually it might be simpler for the mkisofs side to accept larger
in-kernel pipes, but on the performance side I doubt it would matter a
lot. The growisofs side sending data to the drive is not limited by the
64k pipe, typically the commands will be smaller than that anyways. So
"splice N MBs of data from the pipe to the driver" is a nice dream, but
that's not how you talk to the device anyways.
