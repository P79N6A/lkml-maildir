I get this on the 440LX with the same DMA&nbsp;timeout message.&nbsp; Everyone
says it's the board's fault as well.&nbsp; Funny.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways this
happens accross just about any Dev kernel but more so in the -test12 and
up versions. .&nbsp;&nbsp; Test10 works fine without locking.&nbsp; Blaming
the hardware reminds me of the help given by some other company I can't
seem to remember the name to.
