I saw that, too.  But I have
        zeisberg@cepheus:~$ lsusb
        Bus 001 Device 002: ID 046d:c00b Logitech, Inc. MouseMan Wheel
	Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
	Bus 004 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
	Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
	Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
And whenever the reset occured, my keyboard produced mulitple key events
when a key was pressed.
And since I didn't connect my usb cardreader anymore, the problem
disapeared.  (Yes, it is not listed above.  I'll try to find the time to
do some further testing.)

Same for me.  (But at the same time I upgraded my machine from a Duron 600
to a Pentium D 940.  So I thought it has to do with that.)
Best regards
