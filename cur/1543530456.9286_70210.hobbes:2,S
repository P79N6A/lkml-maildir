Greetings,
I just tried downloading and compiling Linux 2.3.99pre1, with Athlon support.
Here is what comes from it :
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/shaman/src/2.3/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe   -DCPU=686 -march=pentiumpro -mpentiumpro -malign-functions=4 -fschedule-insns2 -mwide-multiply -fexpensive-optimizations -march=i686 -fno-strict-aliasing -DUTS_MACHINE='"i386"' -c -o init/version.o init/version.c
init/version.c:0: malformed option `-D __pentiumpro__-D__pentiumpro'
make: *** [init/version.o] Error 1
So I search a little and found the corresponding lines in arch/i386/Makefile :
ifdef CONFIG_MK7
CFLAGS := $(CFLAGS) -DCPU=686 -march=pentiumpro -mpentiumpro -malign-functions=4 -fschedule-insns2 -mwide-multiply -fexpensive-optimizations
CFLAGS += $(shell if $(CC) -S -o /dev/null -xc /dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "-march=i686"; fi)
AFLAGS := $(AFLAGS) -DCPU=686
endif
The second "CFLAGS" line seemed strange to me (redondant march?), although 
i don't understand it very much  ;-)
So I commented this line, and the compilation seems to occur correctly, except for DRM
support which i didn't have time yet to test further.
Was it the correct modification to do, or did i miss something ?
