People use overcommitting not because they are fans of the idea.
Overcommitting simply is the _efficient_ way of resource sharing.
It's a waste of resources to reserve memory+swap for the case that every
running process decides to modify libc code (and, thus, should receive its
private copy of the pages).   A real waste!
I always agree to take the risk of some applications being killed in such a
case of all processes turning crazy.
The approach I believe in is:
 - ensure that accidental or intentional madness of applications of one user
   may cause only limited damage to other users; and
 - introduce a way to tell the kernel that some applications should be
   saved longer than others when troubles begin and ways to set up some
   guaranteed amounts for important processes.
Certainly, a lot of processes may consume more than their guarantee until
bad things start to happen.  Then the rules of user protection and killing
order apply.
That's how I develop the resource control in the beancounter patch
