This is a win-win situation.  for us, it is NOT a problem if the press
see the move as too adversarial.  In fact - that would be the best
outcome of all because then we have the press and general opinion
against dumb patents.
Putting an end to stupid patents in general (and software patents
specifically) is even better than bogging a difficult hw company
down with lawsuits.
If they think the move is too nasty - then it must be because the
move itself is a bad thing - an opportunity that shouldn't exist, right?
