Eh?  Where did that mickey mouse idea come from.  PPR is Mandatory in
SCSI-3 and above SPI class devices, so *yes*, we *should* be assuming
that.  The DT INQUIRY bit was not added to indicate PPR (although PPR is
a requirement of implementing it), it was added so that devices that
didn't conform to the entire SCSI-3 spec and couldn't qualify to carry a
SCSI-3 level could still use higher transfer speeds.  Consider it an LVD
addendum to the SCSI-2 spec.
All this patch does is *hide* the problem, the bug still exists and it's
in the sym_2 driver.
Further, most devices don't change the DT bit in the INQUIRY return data
or their SCSI level depending on bus conditions that will effect whether
or not they can do LVD signaling rates, so the PPR bit is a capability
bit, not a guaranteed to be appropriate at this moment in time bit.
With this patch, those devices that are on LVD buses, support higher
speed transfers, and are full SCSI-3 (or at least some portion of them
will, most SCSI-3 devices didn't use the DT INQUIRY bit as it's
redundant, don't know about the latest stuff) will start magically
negotiating all the way down to a max of 80MB/s data transfer rates
without any CRC checks on the data, parity checks only.
This is a totally broken patch.  I wrote up a description of what the
driver needs to be doing for this stuff and sent it to linux-scsi
mailing list on Nov. 5th.  Just because no one has fixed up the sym_2
driver to do the right thing is no reason to hork the SCSI layer. NAK.
