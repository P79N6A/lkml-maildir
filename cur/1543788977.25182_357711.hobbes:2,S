Subject: 2.6.14-rc4-rt1 - enable IRQ-off tracing causes kernel to fault at boot

Config file attached. The only change was to enable IRQ-off latency
tracing using make menuconfig. Rebuild and reboot. I got a message
about the kernel not syncing, lots of stuff above that message about
do_futex, etc.
This was not a problem on 2.6.14-rc3-rt13.
Thanks,
Mark
