[QUOTE]
        My general conclusion is that since they were able to write a user
        space implementation that avoids the problem something must be broken
        in the kernel readahead logic for sendfile().
Maybe the user space solution does the trick by using a larger window size?
IMHO, the stock read-ahead is not designed with extremely high concurrency in
mind. However, 100 streams should not be a problem at all.
