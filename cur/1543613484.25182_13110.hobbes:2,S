Here's a more blatant problem with SCSI in 2.4.16 that still exists
in 17-rc1.  As an RC it is probably too late to fix for '17, but
whatever.
(This may have been introduced in 2.4.15, I haven't yet checked)
This problem is that th kernel panics on boot as soon as it reaches
the AIC7xxx module, which is loaded at the end (i.e. not built in).
This only happens from cold; when the machine is rebooted it will
initialise the SCSI card successfully.. just never on the first
attempt.  The aic7xxx_old driver works.
Barring transcription errors, here are the details:
SCSI 0:1:0 attempting to queue an abort message
