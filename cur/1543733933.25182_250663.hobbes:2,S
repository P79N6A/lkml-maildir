I have a few minor changes coming up as well.
One nitpick: As vmexe and vmlib are always 0 for !CONFIG_MMU, we should
ifdef them out of the list of offered fields for that configuration (and
maybe in nproc_ps_field as well).

task_nommu.c offers Mem, Slack, and Shared. __task_mem for !CONFIG_MMU
offers VmData, VmStack, VmRSS, VmSize.
