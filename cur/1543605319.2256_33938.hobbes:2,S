A semi-random thought on the tree-quota concept:
Does it really make sense to charge a tree quota to a single specific
user? I haven't really looked into what would be required to implement
it, but my mental picture of a tree quota is somewhat divorced from the
user concept, other than maybe the quota table containing a pointer to
a contact for quota violations. The bookkeeping might be easier if each
tree quota root just held a cumulative total of allocated space, and
maybe a just a user name for contacts (or on the fancier side, a hook
to execute something...).
I know it's kinda half-baked, but that's my $0.015...
