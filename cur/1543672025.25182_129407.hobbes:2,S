I'm happy to discuss this.  As I see it, there are at least 4
possibilities:
1. Standardize on the netif_msg_xxx (bit map) approach.
2. Standardize on simple reporting levels (if (debug >= 2)...).
3. Make the driver provide a filtering function, which can do #1, #2 or
some
other driver-specific test.
4. Status quo: make the message-level test before calling netdev_xxx.
The people I've talked to tend to prefer either #1 or #4, although we
haven't
talked much about #2 and #3.  There's also the issue of whether all this
should
be gated by the severity level -- e.g., always log a message that has a
severity
in the range KERN_ERR - KERN_EMERG.

I think message filtering is a good idea.  I also think the following
features
would be useful:
a. Identify which device and driver the message refers to.
b. Call net_ratelimit() in appropriate contexts.
c. Capture caller info (__FILE__ and/or __FUNCTION__).
d. Actually log the severity level.  (I know, this is a syslogd issue.)
e. Standardize certain messages so that all drivers log predictable,
standard
messages (perhaps along with driver-specific info) under certain
circumstances.
e. Capture the messages in a form that is more amenable to automated
analysis
than is plain text.
f. Capture the messages in a form that lends itself to translation (in
user space)
to other languages.
This can all be done.  Most of it has already been implemented and/or
suggested at
one time or another. Message filtering plus a, b, and e require the
caller to
provide additional info.  The other features have other tradeoffs.  Our
experience
with the dev_* macros is that at least some maintainers consider (a)
worth the
tradeoff.  If there's a demand for other features, we are happy to try
to oblige.
