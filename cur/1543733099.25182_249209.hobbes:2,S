I have my personal drugged-up history.
Take a toke, man.
IOW: You're obviously right.

Well, that's so much slower and not any more obvious than just doing the 
iterative few system calls that I don't really see the point other than 
from a scripting standpoint, but on the other hand I can't see how you'd 
use sched_setaffinity() and friends from within a script anyway, so ;)
(yes, there's perl syscalls, but then the standard "find the size" also 
works fine ;)
