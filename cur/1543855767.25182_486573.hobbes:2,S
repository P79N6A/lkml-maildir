Make that git://git.infradead.org/~dedekind/ubi-2.6.git
or 
http://git.infradead.org/?p=users/dedekind/ubi-2.6.git
And it would be helpful (at least to me) if you'd keep an 'mtd' or
'linus' branch in your tree, which shows the point at which you last
pulled from your upstream tree(s). That way, 'git-diff mtd..' or
'gitk mtd..' work.
