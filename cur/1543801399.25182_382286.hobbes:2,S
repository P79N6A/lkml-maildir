Subject: [-mm PATCH] make DEBUG_KERNEL dependent options indent nicely and fix DEBUG_SHIRQ help text
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/5/456

Move DEBUG_SHIRQ up a bit so that options depending on DEBUG_KERNEL are
still nicely indented in the menuconfig menu.
This patch also includes the change to the help text from my previous patch,
so you can just apply this one and get both :-)
