I must disagree here. Special cases are always dangerous especially
if they are hard to regression test. I made this discovery the hard
way on x86-64 ... It's best to eliminate them in the first place,
otherwise they will later come back and bite you when you don't expect it.
Adding NULL tests all over mm for this would seem like a clear case
of this to me.
