It's big, it's complex, and nobody seems to take it that seriously (the
only people who ever asked _me_ about it was Intel, and they seem to
have cancelled their own projects). 
If it turns out to be a big hit, it can be backported. But as it looks
now, it has very little relevance for any 2.6 freeze schedule.
