No. The in-service latch is what Johnson was refering to and, is
in fact, the memory of the chip.

No, the 8080 could not use vectored interrupts. The 8085 was correctly
shown.

No. INTA comes from the CPU. Writing the EIO comes from the port, i.e.,
0x20 out port 0x20 by any means you want including the CPU.

Sure, sure, sure. You call my collegue a liar and then hide in the
corner and cry. If you took the time to learn from your mistakes, you
might know something. Johnson spent some considerable time and effort,
reviewing his response with me, to show you how these very old devices
worked.

          I speak only for myself, which is enough of a problem.
