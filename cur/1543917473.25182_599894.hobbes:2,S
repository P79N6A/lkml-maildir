the per bdi work in -mm should make the system not drop dead.
Still, would a remove,re-insert of the usb media end up with the same
bdi? That is, would it recognise as the same and resume the transfer.
Anyway, it would be grand (and dangerous) if we could provide for a
button that would just kill off all outstanding pages against a dead
device.
