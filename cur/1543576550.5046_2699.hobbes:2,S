Humm, interesting.

The change affecting you is most likely the CDROMREADAUDIO change,
where we now just read a single cdda frame at the time. This gives
us less data per interrupt, and apparently this is more than a
theoretical slowdown for you. Please try with attached patch. If
this solves it (as it should), then we should probably try and do
persistent allocation of a bigger buffer for things like this.
Grabbing > 1 frame was disabled because multi-page allocation is not
reliable.
