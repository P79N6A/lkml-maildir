Sure you link your object file with your own instead of using
the default....
     gcc -c -o myprog.o myprog.c
     as -o start.o start.S
     ld -o myprog myprog.o start.o /lib/libc.so.6

                         |       |__________________ Your startup
                         |__________________________ Your program
Startup starts with a label _start. You may have to write it
in assembly. It calls main() and must never return. Instead
it calls exit() with whatever main() returned, to quit.
__init() is some M$ thing. Linux executables start with
_start().
