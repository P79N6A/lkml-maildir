AFAIKS, no.
If this happens before migrate_all_tasks, there shouldn't be a
problem because migrate_all_tasks will move the woken task anyway.
It can't happen after migrate_all_tasks, because there is nothing
on the offline CPU to be woken up.
If you do need the check there, then my lazy migrate method is
unquestionably better, because this is the only thing it would
otherwise have to add to a fastpath. Right?
