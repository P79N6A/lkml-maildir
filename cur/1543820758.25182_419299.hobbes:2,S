not savings in text size, I'll settle for the same size.
What we gain is less branches in the hotpath... eg a kfree that gets
optimized now has one less branch. Note that the branch predictor isn't
going to help you for these 100% cases, since the same branch "slot" is
shared between all callers; with this inline the branch predictor at
least gets to keep stats for each of the callers individually.
That is where the gain is....
