Well, it _is_ mysterious.
Did you try to locate the code which failed?  I got lost in macros and
include files, and gave up very very easily.  Stop hiding, Ingo.

On test system, boot with
netconsole=4444@<test-system-ip-addr>/eth0,<udp-port-no>@<workstation-ip-addr>/<workstation-mac-addr>
On workstation:
sudo netcat -u -l -p <udp-port-no> | tee -a ~/.log/log-<test-system-hostname>
