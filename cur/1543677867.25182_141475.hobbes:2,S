BTW, are you using CPU frequency scaling? While playing with my P4's CPU
frequency scaling, lowering the CPU frequency below a threshold
frequency value (below 1.4GHz approx.), the system starts acting
erratically: the keyboard generates event at twice or three times the
normal speed iiitttsss nnneeeaaarrrlllyyy iiimmmpppooosssiiibbbllleee to
type anything. The system clock starts skewing at a really fast pace and
the mouse is unusable. The only solution is returning the CPU frequency
to a higher value.
