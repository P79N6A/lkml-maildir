This isn't a commercial project with teams picking up "slack".  It's
mostly volunteers, using their private time as they see fit.  Progress
is made in pieces, nobody is obliged to "finish" anything, and people
contribute incomplete features so that someone else with time, energy
and inclination might complete them.
Being rude is inappropriate.  Words like "didn't bother" and "slack"
are offensive in this context, much like calling someone who works 100
hours a week "a lazy programmer" because they'd need 200 hours to do
what you think they should have done is offensive.
