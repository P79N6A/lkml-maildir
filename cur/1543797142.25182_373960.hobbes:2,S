I can't see that it makes sense to replace sector_t with blkcnt_t in the
case of kstatfs. The only place where it may make sense is i_block,
since that grows the size of the inode on embedded systems.
Here is a patch to fix the former.

VFS: Convert abuses of sector_t
 The type "sector_t" is heavily tied in to the block layer interface as an
 offset/handle to a block, and is subject to a supposedly block-specific
 configuration option: CONFIG_LBD. Despite this, it is used in struct
 kstatfs to save a couple of bytes on the stack whenever we call the
 filesystems' ->statfs().
 One consequence is that networked filesystems may break if CONFIG_LBD is
 not set, since it is quite common to have multi-TB remote filesystems.
 The following patch just converts struct kstatfs to use the standard type u64.
