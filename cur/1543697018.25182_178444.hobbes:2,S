i was just wondering if there was any further progress on a possible 
native kernel driver for the promise 20376 sata chip... i have it 
running now but with the proprietary driver from promise's website.... 
but it seems to work well,
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   1692 MB in  2.00 seconds = 846.00 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  232 MB in  3.01 seconds =  77.08 MB/sec
much better then the reported silicon image tests i have seen....  i 
hope someone is still talking to promise about releasing the full source 
to get this into the kernel or working to reverse engineer a driver... 
all the information i have found searching lkml seems to be atleast a 
couple of months old.
ciao

p.s. i am not on the mailing list though do check it frequently but if i 
could be cc'ed aboutthis question that would be great... thanks again
