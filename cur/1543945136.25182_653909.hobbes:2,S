Subject: [PATCH 2.6.24 1/1] sch_htb: fix "too many events" situation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Martin Devera <devik@cdi.cz>
HTB is event driven algorithm and part of its work is to apply
scheduled events at proper times. It tried to defend itself from
livelock by processing only limited number of events per dequeue.
Because of faster computers some users already hit this hardcoded
limit.
This patch uses loops_per_jiffy variable to limit event processing
up to single jiffy interval and then delay remainder to other
jiffy.

BTW, from my measurement is seems that value 500 was good one
for my first 600MHz machine :-)
Maybe I can make something self-converging (using tasklets probably)
but I'm not sure if it is worth of the complexity.
