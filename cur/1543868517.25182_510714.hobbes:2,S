Something a little different from what you're seeing.  Basically if the
PF_MEMALLOC paths end up waiting on a filesystem transaction, and that
transaction is waiting for more ram, the system will eventually grind to
a halt.  data=journal is the easiest way to hit it, since writepage
always logs at least 4k.
WB_SYNC_NONE and wbc->nonblocking aren't a great test, in reiser I
resorted to testing PF_MEMALLOC.
