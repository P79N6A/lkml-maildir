Honestly, the security nightmare begins with the compile.  A patch to
the build system can result in arbitrarily insecure commands being run
during the compile - way easier than doing something that affects the
compiled kernel.  A machine doing automatic compiles of untrusted
patches should be viewed as completely sacrificial from the beginning.
