Great!  So cpusets is good to go for the mainline then (i.e. no major 
objections to the interface).  Note that implementation details that don't 
affect the interface are another subject entirely, e.g. the sched domains 
approach for scheduling as opposed to cpus_allowed.

Excellent, I hope that it comes together into a form suitable for the 
mainline, I think there are some really nice aspects to it.
Thanks,
