Can we please then just separate the two functions out into "fetch sector
data" and "fetch drive ID"? And NOT playing with another frigging broken
passed-down flag that people get wrong and isn't obvious what it does
anyway? It's a lot easier to do
	/* On sane architectures, data and ID are accessed the same */
	#define ide_fetch_sector_data(...) __ide_fetch_data(..)
	#define ide_fetch_id_data(...) __ide_fetch_data(..)
than it is to carry a flag around and having to remember to get it right 
in every place this is used.
It's more efficient too, but the _clarity_ and lack of dynamic flags is a 
hell of a lot more important.
And stupid architectures that may have to re-implement (and possible
duplicate) the ID fetch code only have themselves to blame. Although it 
might easily be as simple as
	/*
	 * The PCI bus is wired up the wrong way, we need to byteswap
	 * the ID results after they come back
	 */
	static inline xxx ide_fetch_id_data(...)
	{
		__ide_fetch_data(..)
		bswap_id_data(..)
	}
and please keep this in some m68k-specific file instead of forcing 
_everybody_ to know about the braindamage.
