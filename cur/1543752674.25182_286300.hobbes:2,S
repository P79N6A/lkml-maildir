I've heard that N times, too. I'm just failing to see that this justifies
the existence of that list and that's why I'm asking for other arguments.

Releasing it a month later doesn't remove the rush and panic of the _users_
who are paniced and rush to install the freshly released kernels.

They are vulnerable all the time since the "internal" disclosure to the
public one. What makes you think that keeping things secret on the list
won't allow the bad guys to discover the vulnerability? As Linus said, they
are probably _more_ motivated than the good guys.

Come on, it's just a matter of throwing in more hardware to that process.

I realize that. In Debian we support a few very slow architectures. But,
let's not fool ourselves, the slow architectures aren't nearly as popular as
x86 or x86_64, ppc.

If speed is an issue, I guess a vendor can afford getting 5 ARM/m68k/8086
(:) machines and distribute the build across them.

Looking from the vendor point of view, you are perfectly right. Looking from
the user point of view, the user is as exposed with the closed list and new
vendor kernels released as with the open list and immediate disclosures. In
both cases it's a sort of a miracle for a user not to be hacked. Remember
the recent php problem? Before we knew, many, many, many sites were hacked -
even though the release with fixes was out. I don't know whether those
vulnerabilities were known to vendor-sec before that but if they were, the
delay didn't do a thing to make the situation better. Simply, no difference
- as far as I am concerned, the only argument so far for the existence of
the totally closed list is that "vendors must have time to build
kernels/software", as you wrote above. Not nearly enough of a reason, IMHO.
