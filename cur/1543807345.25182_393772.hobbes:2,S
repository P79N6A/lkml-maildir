Interesting ... feels like a BIOS problem.  If you want to experiment,
there's a right bracket -- "}" -- immediately before that.  Try moving
it right after that write, so that write_config_byte is covered by the
preceding "if LEGSUP_BIOS" test; or copying the much later "disable SMI"
clause into an "else" for that "if".
