I strongly disagree.
The only segment which has some merit is the one which replaces the .name
with DRV_NAME. It could have been "usb-block" or something, but we probably
won't be using that, so it's all right.
But the rest is quite bad, the worst being indenting the switch statement.
Is there nothing else you can do in the whole kernel?
