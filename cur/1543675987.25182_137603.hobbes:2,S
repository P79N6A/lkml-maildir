-rc6 is better - comparable to 2.4.18 in what I have seen with my script.  
After the long obscure problems since 2.4.19x, -rc6 could use serious 
stress-testing. 
User level testing is not sufficient here - it's just like playing roulette.
By serious stress-testing I mean:
Everone testing comes up with  one dedicated "tough test" 
which _must_ be reproducible (program, script) along his line of 
expertise/application.
Two or more of these independent tests are run in combination.
This method should increase the coverage drastically.
