It's up to Linus really, he's the consumer of these messages.
Given that git-pull-script requires two arguments, URL and optional 
branch, it sounds like
'rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/libata-dev.git 
new-ids' would be the best syntax, if it weren't for darned word wrap.
