With this section of your patch:
+               if (!(p->time_slice % TIMESLICE_GRANULARITY) &&
that would requeue active tasks a variable duration into their running time 
dependent on their task timeslice rather than every 50ms. Shouldn't it be:
+               if (!((task_timeslice(p) - p->time_slice) % TIMESLICE_GRANULARITY) &&
to ensure it is TIMESLICE_GRANULARITY into the timeslice of a process?
