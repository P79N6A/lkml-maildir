I turned it off, and turned on debugging for stack and memory allocations.
It still crashes at boot time, in a slightly different way.
I got an "endless" amount of
[<c011f202>] register_proc_table+0xc0/0xd6
scrolling by at high speed.  After a minute or so it ended with
addr_conf_init
inet6_init
oo_initcalls
init
init
kernel_thread_helper
I have ipv6 compiled into the kernel, others with the same problem
seems to have this common factor.
