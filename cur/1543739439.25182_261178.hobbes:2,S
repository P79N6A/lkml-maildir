Ingo,
    In reading your -U3 patch the test below (#156)
wasn't clear to me.   It would seem in the case of
softirq_preemption, __do_softirq() should be called
to kick ksoftirqd, otherwise ___do_softirq() would
be called to exec softirqs in the immediate context.
kernel/softirq.c:
  153   asmlinkage void _do_softirq(void)
  154   {
  155           local_irq_disable();
  156           if (!softirq_preemption)
  157                   __do_softirq();
  158           else
  159                   ___do_softirq();
  160           local_irq_enable();
  161   }
