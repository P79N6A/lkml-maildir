   Ok, this particular code change in 2.2.14-pre1[34] is responsible
   for an exception in __copy_user on every attemp to mount or unmount
   a file system (at least ext2 file system).
 ...
   Who own to this change, why it was done and what is missing?
Alan owns the change, and it was done on purpose, and the behavior you
see is correct, the Alpha port is the problem.
Alpha is buggy for reporting exceptions wrt. user space accesses
in the kernel logs, in fact it's a possible DoS attack on Alpha/Linux
machines.
So Alpha should be fixed.
Later,
