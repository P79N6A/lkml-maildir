That would lead to maintenance nightmare in the longer term.  We
cannot do that unless we know more or less what is going on.
Including only some system headers in a random order before
feature macros are defined, and doing so in only some source
files randomly until it starts compiling, is not a solution
maintainable in the longer term.
The _EXTENDED stuff is minimally commented that AIX wants it;
otherwise we would have been tempted to say, "remove it, if it
breaks OSX" without thinking, and would have ended up breaking
AIX.
No matter what we do, I would really want a clear description of
in what way OSX headers are broken and what needs to be done to
avoid the breakage in git-compat-util.h where it sets up feature
macros and includes system headers.
