Which, at the proper abstraction level provided by this class, means that it
allows one to switch on or off a power supply channel.
Laptops let one do this with their batteries, too.  It is the same thing.  I
didn't check if the class comes with an attribute for "enable/disable this
power source", but if doesn't, we need to add one: it *is* a generic and
widely used capability in laptops, and according to you, also on PDAs.
