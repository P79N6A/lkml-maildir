The following code is in the function do_readv_writev in the file
fs/read_write.c (2.6.8.1):
	/*
	 * Single unix specification:
	 * We should -EINVAL if an element length is not >= 0 and fitting an
	 * ssize_t.  The total length is fitting an ssize_t
	 *
	 * Be careful here because iov_len is a size_t not an ssize_t
	 */
	tot_len = 0;
	ret = -EINVAL;
	for (seg = 0; seg < nr_segs; seg++) {
		ssize_t len = (ssize_t)iov[seg].iov_len;
		if (len < 0)	/* size_t not fitting an ssize_t .. */
			goto out;
		tot_len += len;
		if ((ssize_t)tot_len < 0) /* maths overflow on the ssize_t */
			goto out;
	}
	if (tot_len == 0) {
		ret = 0;
		goto out;
	}
There is a potential problem here, namely, that the result of the
conversion to ssize_t is implementation defined (ISO-C
6.3.1.3|3). This is not a problem with current gcc versions, but might
become a future one, because len need not be below zero after
attempting to convert a value too large for a ssize_t to that type. The
following patch would get rid off this (and corrects to errors in the
comment text ;-).
