I don't know if this affects the frame buffers per se.
But often BIOS's on systems with large amounts of memory configure
overlapping mtrrs (where an uncacheable mtrr would override a larger
cacheable range).  To date this has confused the linux mtrr code when
it tries to modify things, and you cannot properly setup mtrrs.    I
believe this applies to both the fb case as well as X.
