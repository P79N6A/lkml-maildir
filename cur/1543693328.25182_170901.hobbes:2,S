It that scenario relevant to DMA errors?  
I'm talking about problems in steps 1 and 2, not in later steps.
If the kernel starts a write command for block 993, wouldn't it wait
for a DMA interrupt signalling that the drive has received and accepted
the command before the kernel starts the write command for block 10934?
If it timed out waiting for that interrupt, can't it re-issue the
write for block 993 before proceeding?
