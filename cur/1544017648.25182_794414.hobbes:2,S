Hi Uwe,
Ok, will do.

You are correct to raise this issue. It is only spinlock safe if
chip->cansleep is false. Initially, I wasn't sure what to do. The
original gpio set/get_value() just does;
        WARN_ON(extra_checks && chip->can_sleep);
and it is documented as:
"
Spinlock-Safe GPIO access
-------------------------
<snip>
return zero.  Also, using these calls for GPIOs that can't safely be accessed
without sleeping (see below) is an error.
"
I will change this in the batch code to return an error if can_sleep
is detected on any involved gpio_chip.

Agreed. Will change.

Ok, you're right. I'll fix this.

That is a good point. I agree that width is ugly in the main API. It
is just fls(mask) and I now realize that this is an inline so you're
right it would get taken care of by the compiler. fls is checked with
__constant_fls first. Beauty! Thanks Uwe! I'll make these changes.
Thanks,
