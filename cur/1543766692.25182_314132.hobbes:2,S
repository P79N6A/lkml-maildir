RDMA registers and uses the memory the user specifies. That is why byte
granularity and multiple redundant registrations are explicitly specified.
The mechanism by which this requirement is implemented is of course
OS dependent. But the requirements are that the application specifies
what portion of their memory they want registered (or what set of physical
pages if they have sufficient privilege) and that request is either honored
or refused by a resource manager (one preferably as integrated with
general OS resource management as possible).
The other aspect is that remotely enabled memory regions and memory
windows most be enabled for hardware access for the duration of 
the region or window -- indefinitely until process death or explicit
termination by the application layer.
Theoretically there is nothing in the wire protocols that requires source
buffers to be pinned indefinitely, but that is the only way any RDMA
interface has ever worked -- so "brain death" must be pretty widespread.
The fact that this problem must be solved for remotely accessible
buffers, and that for cluster applications like MPI there is no distinction
between buffers used for inbound messages and outbound messages,
might have something to do with this.
User verbs needs to deal with these actual Memory Registration requirements,
including the very real application need for Memory Windows. The solution
should map to existing OS controls as much as possible.
