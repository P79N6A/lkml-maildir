I think with the new vmap changes that went in in -pre7 means
you will need to get a new drm module (like from X cvs or
http://dri.sourceforge.net/downloads.phtml
) and recompile it
with the new kernel headers which will then pick up the define
-DVMAP_4_ARGS in the Makefile and give you a good module that works.
The DRI kernel trees need updating.
Can you download from the link above and cd to drm and do a
	make -f Makefile.linux radeon.o
and report please if that works for you without crashing glx* ?

I have XFree86 4.2.1 (i.e. xfree86-common, xserver-xfree86,
xlibmesa3-gl, etc) version 4.2.1-9 from Debian unstable installed.
I think you mean file descriptor 4:
    open("/dev/dri/card0", O_RDWR)          = 4
$ ls -la /dev/dri/card0
crw-rw-rw-    1 root     root     226,   0 Jul 12 04:21 /dev/dri/card0
