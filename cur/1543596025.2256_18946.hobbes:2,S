	We have this multithreaded app that run fine under the kernel 2.2.x
series. Last week, we decided to update our linux and went dor RedHat7.1 to
use the new kernel. Some threadsw of our app just hangs in random moments.
	Is there any issue on the 2.4.x series that must be observed that we
are missing?
	Thanks.
