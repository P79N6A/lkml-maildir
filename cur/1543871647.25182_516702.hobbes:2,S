Anonymous-only would make it a doorstop for Oracle, since its entire
motive for using it is to window into objects larger than user virtual
address spaces (this likely also applies to UML, though they should
really chime in to confirm). Restrictions to tmpfs and/or ramfs would
likely be liveable, though I suspect some things might want to do it to
shm segments (I'll ask about that one). There's definitely no need for a
persistent backing store for the object to be remapped in Oracle's case,
in any event. It's largely the in-core destination and source of IO, not
something saved on-disk itself.
