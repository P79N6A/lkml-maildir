Why not use LVM for /dev/md1 ?
	pvcreate /dev/md1
	vgcreate myvg /dev/md1
	lvcreate -L 10G -n root myvg
	lvcreate -L 2G -n swap myvg
	lvcreate -L 20G -n home myvg
Also since you have specified raid0 for /dev/md1 you could
use striping under LVM instead of RAID:
	pvcreate /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdc2
	vgcreate myvg /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdc2
	lvcreate -L 10G -n root -i 2 -I 32 myvg
	lvcreate -L 2G -n swap -i 2 -I 32 myvg
	lvcreate -L 20G -n home -i 2 -I 32 myvg
That way you have some flexibility in your use of sdb2
and sdc2, e.g. you can move your LVs off sdc2 if you want
to replace or extend it later.
