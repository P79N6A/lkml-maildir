It's fixed with the patch with subject '[PATCH 08/13] Fix maximum for 
the saturation and contrast controls.' It was posted by Mauro to the 
linux mailinglist a week ago. I hope it will be fixed in 2.6.16, but 
Mauro should know more about it. It was a stupid copy-and-paste bug so 
I see no reason why it shouldn't go in.
