This isn't always the case. Sometimes the interface puts requirements
(contract-like) upon the implementation. Case in point in the kernel,
dnotify versus inotify. dnotify is a steaming pile of worthlessness,
because it's userspace interface is so bad (meaning inefficient) as to
be nearly unusable.
inotify has a different interface, one that supplies details about
events rather that mere notice that an event occurred, and therefore
has different requirements in implementation. dnotify probably was a
good design, but for a worthless interface.
The interface isn't always important, but it's certainly something
that has to be understood before putting the finishing touches on the
behind-the-scenes implementation.
