But this will only happen if there are synchonization "effects".  It
should not occur in the average case (i.e., >10% of interrupts).  If
it does, it indicates to me one of three things: a buggy board, a
buggy driver, or a buggy PCI standard.
I'd be somewhat bothered if I found out that my computer was handling
100+ interrupts per second in which the device said "Oops... I didn't
really mean that..."

It optimizes latency, that is all.
