my bios irq settings are currently set to AUTO.
i don't know why 3 resources (ne2k-pci, the winbond isdn module and the
acpi) want the same irq 9 whereas there are a lot of free irqs...
the manteiner of the ACPI driver sayd his driver is ok for irq sharing....
what about ne2k and winbond isdn ? i don't know how to contact the
manteiners of this drivers....
Summarizing the problem....
My system load modules in this order:
1) ACPI
2) ISDN (Windbond - HiSax)
3) RealTek PCI NE2000 ethernet
-If I compile the kernel with ACPI on, step 2 fails....
-If I compile the kernel with ACPI off step 2 is ok (hisax modules loaded on  
  irq 9) but ne2k-pci conflicts is also assigned to irq 9, correctly loaded
  but with the SIOCFIFFLAGS error and unusable with ifconfig.
My bios only allow me to change irq setting from AUTO to irq X (on slot
4 (isdn) and 5 (eth0) simultaneously). I tried to set it from AUTO to 12
but it didn't resolve the conflict...
The most strange thing is that with previous 2.4.0 test kernels everything
worked fine....
Many thanx.
