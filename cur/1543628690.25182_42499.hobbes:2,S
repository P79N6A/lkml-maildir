   Why not call it NETIF_F_VLAN ?
    
BTW, your mail client's mangling of subject lines is REALLY ANNOYING.
We don't call it NETIF_F_VLAN because the hope is that eventually
it will be rare for a network device to not be able to support it.
Not the other day around.
Please fix your mail client before replying anymore, ok?  Thanks.
Franks a lot,
