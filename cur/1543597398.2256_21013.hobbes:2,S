AC's comment was about whether the drive's cache would be written out 
on power failure, which is another issue, a little harder to test 
(and not easily testable by writing a single sector). I raise the 
related question of what happens to the write cache on a bus reset on 
SCSI drives.

My impression, based a a little but not much research, is that most 
SCSI drives disable write caching by default. IBM SCSI drives may be 
an exception to this.
