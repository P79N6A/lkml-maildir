What about this case:
1. Conntrack entry is created and placed on the unconfirmed list
2. The event cache bumps the refcount of the conntrack entry
3. module removal of ip_conntrack unregisters all hooks
4. packet is dropped by an iptables rule
5. packet is freed but we still have a refcount on the conntrack entry
Now there's no way to get that refcount to decrease as that only happens
when the event cache receives another packet or the current packet makes
it through the stack as you wrote above. And neither of this will happen
since we unregistered the hooks providing the packets and dropped the
packet.
I ran into this case a while ago during stresstesting and rewrote the
event cache to not increase the refcount, but this has the drawback that
events caused by dropped packets won't be reported. This may not be a
good thing...
