Thanks for the kind words...  The above-mentioned test verified that the
bisection was/is correct: 2f1f53bdc6531696934f6ee7bbdfa2ab4f4f62a3 works,
and 6f37ac793d6ba7b35d338f791974166f67fdd9ba doesn't.  Now I've got to
figure out why.
"git diff 2f1f53bdc6531696934f6ee7bbdfa2ab4f4f62a3 6f37ac793d6ba7b35d338f791974166f67fdd9ba"
produced a relatively short patch (18,437 bytes).  The list of involved

Current state of the source tree is the 6f37ac... version, so I'll start
backing out the above diffs in related groups and continue until I've got
a working kernel.  For lack of an obvious target, I'll start with the
seemingly innocuous change to sysctl_check.c.  I'll report back when I've
got something.
