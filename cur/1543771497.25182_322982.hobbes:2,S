It is the way to go.

Not at all, why do you think I mean that?

No, you can still use the firmware core code, that's what it is there
for.  But don't mess with the "make the user provide a filename" stuff.
Just have your driver create the firmware request and then relax.  Your
code will get called when the firware is written to, right?  That's all
you need.
What's with this obsession about firmware filenames... :)
