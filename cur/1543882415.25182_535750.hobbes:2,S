Benjamin,
Friggin Outlook and our M$ centered corporate IT environment. Even when
you tell it to send plain text it modifies it. This was my first attempt
at patch submission, so I don't know all the hoops yet.
I can try sending the patch again if I can figure out how to disable the
line wrap. Or if you have some FTP server I can put to I can send you
the patch file directly there.
Please let me know which you'd prefer.
Thanks,
Jeff
