Clearly mission critical software should be available long term. Open 
source is one way to provide that, as is buying from a solid company. But 
if you were hit by a bus, who would maintain ProDVD?
Not having a clear answer I would assume "no one." Open source isn't a 
requirement, some viable plan other than "migrate to something else" is. 
If good size companies are willing to put their code in escrow to release 
if the company is no longer supporting for some reason, it's a viable 
business concern.
