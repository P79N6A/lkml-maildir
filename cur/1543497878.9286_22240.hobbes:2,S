Since when did NT's write-to-file produce valid postscript output with
an NT postscript driver installed!!!
I suggest you have a look at the output sometime - take a PDF file,
load it into acroread on both NT and Linux, and tell both to
print-to-file it, and then examine the output.
Result: The NT version has several lines of junk at the start, and
when you later send that file to the printer under NT, the driver
chops that junk out and just sends the valid postscript to the
printer. Tell Linux to send it to the printer, and it CORRECTLY sends
the junk as well - and it's that junk that causes the "illegal
instruction" report on the printer.
Best wishes from Riley.
