Let me guess: a Lucent Orinico PCI adapter, right? It should work with
linux-2.4.6, I submitted a patch for 2.4.6-pre8 (or so) and it is
included in linux-2.4.6. I currently have it working on two non-SMP
systems (ALi 1541 and Intel 440FX chipsets).

Make sure that the Cardbus driver is not a module. IOW: your kernel
configuration should have these lines:
#
# PCMCIA/CardBus support
#
CONFIG_PCMCIA=y
CONFIG_CARDBUS=y
# CONFIG_I82365 is not set
# CONFIG_TCIC is not set
