Hey, really, this is an excellent idea: what a boon you could become to 
FreeBSD, again! How much they must be longing for your insightful 
feedback, how much they must be missing your charming style and tactful 
approach! I bet they'll want to print your mails out, frame them and 
hang them over their fireplace, to remember the good old days on cold 
snowy winter days, with warmth in their hearts! Please?
