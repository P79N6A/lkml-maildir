That depends on how many of these accelerators you already have in the 
system. If you have 4 of them and they are heavily used so that you want 
to offload them it definantly isn't cheap to add a 5th (you useually have 
to go up to 8 or so and the difference between 4 and 8 is frequently 2x-4x 
the cost of the 4 processor box)
now if you start with a single CPU system then yes, adding a second one is 
cheap. but these are useually not the people who really need TOE (they may 
think that they do, but that's a different story :-)
