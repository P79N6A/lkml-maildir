I think the bug is, the driver specifically doesn't like my 
controller-sata converter-hd combination. As I stated in my very first 
message, on HD access the siimage.c constantly calls:
static int siimage_mmio_ide_dma_test_irq (ide_drive_t *drive)
{
	ide_hwif_t *hwif	= HWIF(drive);
	unsigned long base	= (unsigned long)hwif->hwif_data;
	unsigned long addr	= siimage_selreg(hwif, 0x1);
	if (SATA_ERROR_REG) {
		u32 ext_stat = hwif->INL(base + 0x10);
		u8 watchdog = 0;
		if (ext_stat & ((hwif->channel) ? 0x40 : 0x10)) {
//			u32 sata_error = hwif->INL(SATA_ERROR_REG);
//			hwif->OUTL(sata_error, SATA_ERROR_REG);
//			watchdog = (sata_error & 0x00680000) ? 1 : 0;
//#if 1
//			printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: sata_error = 0x%08x, "
//				"watchdog = %d, %s\n",
//				drive->name, sata_error, watchdog,
//				__FUNCTION__);
//#endif
		} else {
Thats why I commented above portions out, otherwise my dmesg gets 
flooded. What is strange, when I compile the kernel to *not* enable DMA 
at boot, the siimage DMA gets enabled nevertheless, so I am not sure 
whether hdparm -d1 and kernel boot take the same path to enable DMA. It 
seems some sort of hack within siimage.c is used to enable DMA on my 
drive. Remember, I have no native SATA drive, maybe thats the problem.
