Hiya.
The latest reiserfs patch on ftp.namesys.com causes compilation errors
against test12 due to the task queue changes. Does this look correct?

It does at least compile with these changes, but I haven't yet tested
it. Looking at run_task_queue, it would appear that the while() is now
redundant, but could someone who knows confirm/deny this?
