At least these are words from a kernel developer. I hope this increases the
chances for them to be heard...

How true. And unfortunately I know what you are talking about... :-))
Strangely enough, developing KGI I made the same experiences, except probably
being demotivated more often by the 'officials'.
[Note: The following is not meant offensive in any way.]
I am glad to read this as at least it shades a more objective and less
emotionally light on the approach taken by the GGI/KGI project
(
http://www.ggi-project.org
, 
http://kgi.sourceforge.net
).
The essential concepts of KGI proposed in 1996 (see
http://www2.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue31/0160.html
)
are in the new console code now. You have kernel-space video drivers
(fbdev), input hardware drivers (the input interface) and a
management code (the new console code).
Congratulations for that.

I wish you good luck too. Anyhow, KGI development is still active, and anyone
willing to join is very welcome.

Nice signature. I really like it! :-))
