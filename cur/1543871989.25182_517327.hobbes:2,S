Well then how does gdb deal with ia64? because PAGE_SIZE and friends
aren't available for that arch same with ppc.
Looking at the gdb code they do have places where they define a
PAGE_SIZE but they even mention its a bug
(gdb-6.6/libiberty/getpagesize.c:14) also grepped through their code
looking for includes of page.h come up with nothing.
