Subject: swapping to death (2.2.x)

Kernel: 2.2.1 or 2.2.6
RAM: 48 Mb + 32 M swap
Symptom: sometimes, typically while accessing the WWW through PPP and
netscape or kfm, the machine suddenly begins to swap very hard, to a near
halt.
It is very brutal: the transition between almost no swapping and this
phenomenon takes place in a second.
Do you think it is a case of too little RAM or swap? What surprises me is
that an identical configuration running 2.0.x never had any problem.
Any idea of any system config variable to tweak?
