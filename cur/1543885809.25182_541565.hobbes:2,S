Kernel doc comments as:
/**
 * struct hrtimer - the basic hrtimer structure
 * @node:       red black tree node for time ordered insertion
 * @expires:    the absolute expiry time in the hrtimers internal
 *              representation. The time is related to the clock on
 *              which the timer is based.
give you a nice overview with enough space for good explanations and can
be converted to kernel doc as well.

Well, we have uppercase MACROs and lower case function names.

#define LOGFS_BUG(sb) logfs_bug(sb, __FUNCTION__, __LINE__)
Also the BUG itself will give you enough clue where it happened, so
having the function/line info is not really necessary

and yours uses it in one place and not in the other.
extern is an empty macro, but it makes it clear that this is a global
function declaration

No, it's about pattern recognition. Consistent patterns allow faster

No, open code device_read and add the error path at the place where
device_read is used and put a bug in the error path for now.

if you think you need comments, then please use new lines, i.e:
	if (dest) {
		 /* symlink */
		ret = logfs_inode_write(inode, dest, destlen, 0);
	} else {
		/* creat/mkdir/mknod */
		ret = __logfs_write_inode(inode);

Hmm. Comments are of general use and it's way easier to understand code
when it has comments to functions and tricks used in the code. You don't
write code for people used to existing filesystems. You write code which
is understandable and allows debugging without twisting the brain for
non filesystem wizzards who use it and trap into the occasional problem

Hell no. It documents that you actually want to do this IMHO.

Simply because they force me to figure out where the heck code ends.
It's way easier to parse the comment on top of some statement while you
read through.

I know roughly how it works. It just is not obvious and really needs
some comments.

Well, at least it would be good to return the problem back to the place,
where it actually would do damage and BUG there, so it is more obvious
where you need to work on error handling. Bugs in the middle of nowhere
are not really helpful

	if (ret)

might be optimized by a smart compiler to
	return ret;
but you should do it yourself, as gcc is not always smart

No, "move comment away from the tail" :)
Comments to functions and tricky non obvious code would be really
appreciated.

Still something like:
LOGFS 0 0 0 0 20000 12345 01234 ...
LOGFS 0 0 0 0 20000 12345 01234 ...
makes it easier to find in the logs

cond_resched() calls schedule, when the need_resched flag of the task is
set. yield() goes through schedule always and should not be used in the
kernel.

In a review it matters, as it raises questions, doesn't it.

Put this explanation into the comment with a FIXME. Is far better than
