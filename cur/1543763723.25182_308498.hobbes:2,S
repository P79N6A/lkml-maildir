To port on such platform we'd have to do a lot of rewriting - so much that
the impact of this issue will be lost in noise.
Look, it's very simple:
	* too many people blindly assume that all world is 32bit l-e.
	* too many of those who try to do portable code have very little
idea of what that means - see the drivers that try and mix e.g. size_t with
int, etc.
	* stdint is not widely understood, to put it mildly.
	* ...fast... types have very unfortunate names - these are guaranteed
to create a lot of confusion.
	* pretty much everything in the kernel assumes that
4 = sizeof(int) <=
sizeof(long) = sizeof(pointer) = sizeof(size_t) = sizeof(ptrdiff_t) <=
sizeof(long long) = 8
and any platform that doesn't satisfy the above will require very serious
work on porting anyway.
