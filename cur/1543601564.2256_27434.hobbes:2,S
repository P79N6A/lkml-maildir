Just small question - you are saying that your KT133A works fine with
0x89... Two questions then - Do you have more than 256MB in your box?
And second one: Do you have one, two, or three memory modules installed
on the board? 
If your answer is <=256MB, one module, no surprise then, as AFAIK nobody 
with such config suffers from the problem. But checking also number of 
memory modules looks more like black magic that anything else. 
Hopefully VIA will answer...
                                            Thanks,
