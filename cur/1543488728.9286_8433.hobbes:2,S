Looks like Netscape may have a fix for the bug described on 
the linux-kernel list in January (see
http://lwn.net/1999/0128/a/netscape-hack.html
)
I told Alec about the attachment problem posted more recently 
(see 
http://www.kt.opensrc.org/#4
 ), too, and I think he's looking
into it.
Here's what Alec sent me.  (Thanks, Alec!)
