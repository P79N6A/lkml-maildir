What the controller is saying is that the drive attempted to complete
a command it knew nothing about.  At the time of the failure, the only
command outstanding on the device had tag identifier 0x3c.  The drive
came back with a tag identifier of 0x20.  This looks like a drive
firmware bug, but a bug in the aic7xxx driver cannot be completely
ruled out without a SCSI bus trace of the failure.  All of the state in the
aic7xxx driver is consistent (disconnected cache matches the pending list)
which leads me to conclude that a drive firmware bug is more likely.  Why
would this happen now?  Most drive firmware bugs are load dependent.  They
often will only occur when two commands with just the right characteristics
overlap.  It may well be that a recent change in the 2.5/2.6 kernel has
caused a subtle change in I/O behavior that exposes this issue.
