The problem with the NetApp snapshots is that tar and cp and a few other
programs that check inode numbers get confused and think everything in
the snapshot is a hard link. So you can't copy a snapshot of a file back
over the original without copying it somewhere else first, and it's
painful to make an archive of the snapshots. We have data files on our
filers that get updated frequently, and any time I need to analyze the
same file over time, or restore an old file, it causes problems. I was
throwing it out more as an example of what sort of unexpected things
happen when you slightly change the way the filesystem works.
