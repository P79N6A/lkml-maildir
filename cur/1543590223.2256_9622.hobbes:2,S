This patch will still cause the user process to seg fault: The error
code on the stack will not match the address in %cr2.
	user fault (cr2=useraddr, error_code=5 or 7)
	interrupt
		vmalloc fault (cr2=vmallocaddr, error_code=0 or 2)
			handle vmalloc fault
			iret
		iret
	handle user fault (cr2=vmallocaddr, error_code=5 or 7)
We then fall down to find_vma() which will fail and then send SIGSEGV to
the user process.
