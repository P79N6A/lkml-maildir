The antfrag mechanism depends on the caller being able to sleep and reclaim
pages if necessary to get the contiguous allocation. No attempts are being
currently made to keep pages at a particular order free.
I see the gfpmask was 0x84020. That doesn't look like __GFP_WAIT was set,
right? Does that mean that SLUB is trying to allocate pages atomically? If so,
it would explain why this situation could still occur even though high-order
allocations that could sleep would succeed.
