Yes, it's just the single pointer chase.  Probably that's the common case
now, because everyone will be enabling hugepages on lots of architectures.
But still, the non-compound code is well tested too, and leaving it in
place does make a little microoptimisation available to those who want it,
so I don't see a reason yet to make compound pages compulsory.
So I'd suggest that we make compound pages conditional on a new
CONFIG_COMPOUND_PAGE and make that equal to HUGETLB_PAGE || !MMU.
