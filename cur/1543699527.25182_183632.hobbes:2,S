Hi,
if anyone is able to tell me how to find the io address of the SATA ports I 
could make this patch support the 4 drives of Sil3114 (only the 2 first are 
working atm).
As I really don't know how to find this, I prefer ask to the kernel experts ;)
Once I have this info, making the patch is a matter of a few minutes I think
I tried looking at lspci/scanpci outputs but could not really find any usefull 
informations recording io ports.
Cheers,
Mik
