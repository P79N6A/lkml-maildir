Certainly.  There is provision for a debug stack that can be larger than 
the normal exception stack.  This is used for vectors 1 and 3.  If we 
wish to preserve this, we need to to manual stack switching.
Currently DEBUG_STKSZ is 8K, the same as the normal stack (compared to 
4K for the other execption stacks).  Do we need to implement stack 
switching for debug vectors?
