Unfortunately it is not a fully linear problem. Devices are initialized
late and put the system into a more complex state (i.e. dynticks,
highres) which needs to be suspended and resumed. If we want to do this
completely linear we need to do a full reverse rollback of the system
states, which moves even more complexity into such systems.
Also the linear approach is not working with other devices, as one can
see with the still unresolved "IRQ#X nobody cared" issues at resume,
which break my laptop. It works nice on startup of the system, but
breaks on resume.
