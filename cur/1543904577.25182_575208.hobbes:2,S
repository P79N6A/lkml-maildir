Linus, please pull the latest scheduler git tree from:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
there's 8 commits in this tree - only one modifies scheduling behavior 
(and even that one only slightly so): a fix for a (minor) 
SMP-fairness-balancing problem.
There is one update/fix to the (upstream still unused) cpu_clock() API. 
[ which API will replace all the current (and buggy) in-tree uses of 
  sched_clock(). ]
There are also two small facilities added: preempt-notifiers (which is 
disabled and not selectable by the user and hence a NOP) needed by 
future KVM and other virtualization work and they'd like to see this 
offered by the upstream kernel. There's also the new 
above_background_load() inline function (unused at the moment). The 
presence of these two facilities causes no change at all to the kernel 
image:
    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
 5573413  679332 3842048 10094793         9a08c9 vmlinux.before
 5573413  679332 3842048 10094793         9a08c9 vmlinux.after
so i thought this would be fine for a post-rc1 merge too.
There's also two small cleanup patches, a documentation update, and a 
debugging enhancement/helper: i've merged Nick's long-pending 
sysctl-domain-tree debug patch that has been in -mm for 3 years 
meanwhile. (It depends on CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG and has no effect on 
scheduling by default even if enabled.)
passes allyesconfig, allnoconfig and distro build, boots and works fine 
on 32-bit and 64-bit x86 as well. (and is expected to work fine on every 
architecture)
