I have succeeded in loading the sound drivers after removing line 3379
from trident.c :
pci_write_config_byte(pci_dev, 0xB8, ~temp);
As described on :

I'm not sure about your other problems, but adding the ACPI patch (and
enabling it), enabling Local APIC and IO-APIC for single processor fixed
all other problems I saw with this laptop (not sure which of these
options was the key). I still use the vesa driver for XFree86 though.
Best regards,
Roel
