From kernel-locking.tmpl:
	Any atomic operation is defined to act as a memory barrier
	(ie. as per the <function>mb()</function> macro).  
If people are building locks with the test_* bitops and atomic_*_test
functions, we only need a partial barrier requirement as spin_lock().
This implies non-test atomic ops must have same barrier properties as
spin_unlock().
Alan?  Does it make sense to weaken this restriction?
Rusty.
