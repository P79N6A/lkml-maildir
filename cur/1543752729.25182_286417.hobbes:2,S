>SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR are definitely privileged operations and you
this is the crux of what this whole debate is about. for all of you
people who think about linux on multi-user systems with network
connectivity, running servers and so forth, this is clearly a given.
but there is large and growing body of machines that run linux where
the sole human user of the machine has a strong and overwhelming
desire to have tasks run with the characteristics offered by
SCHED_FIFO and/or SCHED_RR. are they still "privileged" operations on
this class of linux system? what about linux installed on an embedded
system, with a small LCD screen and the sole purpose of running audio
apps live? are they still privileged then?
i think there is room for debate, but its clear that in general,
SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR's "definite" status as privileged operations is
not clear. we are trying to find ways to provide access to it in ways
that don't conflict with the other categories of linux systems where
it clearly needs to be off-limits to unprivileged users.
