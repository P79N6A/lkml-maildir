I have been planning to write an equivelence module that
would save what variables where equivelent.  For example ...
a = b = kmalloc();
c = a;
... a, b and c are all equivelent.
The redundant assignment check looks for places that 
assign a variable to an equivelent variable.  You would 
need to check for this anyway as part of writing the 
equivelence module.
The equivelence module has other uses as well ...
a = b = kmalloc();
if (!a) {
        return -ENOMEM;
}
b->foo = bar;
Right now the dereference check prints a false positive
on those, but the equivelence module would fix that.
I don't have the "redundant code" paper in front of me, 
so I forget what other types of things they looked for.
regards,
dan carpenter
