Subject: [PATCH] amd.c: Corrected broken URL and display the same units at all messages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/26/78

Fixes two messages displaying Megabit (Mb) instead of
Megabyte (MB) and updates URLs.
Hello we are Ioannis Barkas (risc4all@yahoo.com) and
Nikos Barkas (doubl3nuts@yahoo.com).
The printed messages behaviour is not consistent as
one message is printed
with MB and the next two are printed with Mb.Also a
link is broken.
We sent the patch from diff -u as an attachment
because damn yahoo...can't even format an inline patch!
