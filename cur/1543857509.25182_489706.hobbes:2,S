Huh? The most popular architectures are i386 x86_64 sparc ia64 etc which 
all have one or the other form of cmpxchg (some issues with early sparc 
and i386).
And yes the xchg was the first multiprocessor instruction and therefore 
is also available on very old processors.

LL/SC can be easily used to come up with a cmpxchg equivalent.
