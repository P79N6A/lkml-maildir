I assume you're talking about find_and_init_phbs() and eeh_init(),
which are currently called from pSeries_setup_arch().
Would a core_initcall be early enough for those?  It seems to me that
it probably would be.  What are the actual dependencies?  Clearly it
needs to be before pcibios_init(), which is a subsys_initcall.  Is
there anything else that they need to come before?

Indeed.
