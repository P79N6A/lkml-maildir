Subject: What is the difference between kernel_thread() and kthread_create()?

According to Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt,
kernel_thread() is supposed to be replaced by kthread_create().   I
saw a few patches doing these.  Seemingly, NO DIFFERENCE, just replace
the kernel_thread() with kthread_create(), but sometimes it replace it
with kthread_run() instead (thin wrapper around kthread_create())
Still not quite sure why yet.
But more fundamental is the file init/main.c:   which have a
kernel_thread() to create the first init task.   Only a few
kernel_thread() API left, mostly exotic architecture.   But this
central figure does not get replaced - is there a reason for it?   So
question is - is there any difference between kernel_thread() and
kthread_create() in the context of init/main.c?
