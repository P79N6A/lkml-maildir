Deal with it. Hardware is also now auto load and auto unloading too. For 2.5
hopefully a lot of this can be tidied up and done better - persistent storage
in the modules that is written to disk and put back by insmod/rmmod (in 
userspace) will help a lot.
The locking issues are not going to go away. Home PC's are going more and
more USB oriented. Servers are going towards more and more hotswap cards.
