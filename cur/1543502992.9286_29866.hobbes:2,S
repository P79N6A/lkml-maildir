I have a similar problem that Steven Hirsch's locker program triggers:
For no descernable reason, sometimes an export will become Read-Only to
everyone.  If I then try to rmmod nfs and lockd, then I can't (they're
busy).  A reboot cures this, but it isn't consistant.
That was with kernel 2.2.9, 2.2.10 produces similar results, though not
exactly the same.  nfsd can't restart in 2.2.10, because "address is in
use".
Since I'm going to be shipping this in a server product, I need a kernel
that can do this, plus cover the maximal amount of hardware.  Is it only
possible to go backwards, to 2.2.7 + nfsd patches?  Or can I go forwards
somehow?
Thanks for all your help (on this and other issues).
Ciao!
