My guess is that is a result of the 'magic nfs path' in iput. It
appears to be calling clear_inode() without truncating the pages
first.
The reason we haven't seen this before is that we had 'force_delete'
that would always set i_nlink = 0. Unfortunately force_delete is toxic
to mmap(), as it will discard any dirty pages rather than flushing
them to storage, so it was removed in the 2.4.5-pre series...
Al: Is there any reason why the cases
  if (!inode->i_nlink)
and the 'magic nfs path' should be treated differently? Personally,
I'd rather prefer to merge the 2.
The unhashing of the inode is after all only done in NFS when we
believe the inode to be stale and hence we want to throw it out of the
cache ASAP (= same as setting i_nlink to zero but without races).
Cheers,
   Trond
