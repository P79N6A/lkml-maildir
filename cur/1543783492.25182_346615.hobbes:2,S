Or revert gregkh-driver-sysfs-strip_leading_trailing_whitespace.patch. 
Obviously if you write 30\n and the write returns 2 then the shell will
then try to write the \n.  That returns zero and the shell tries again, ad
infinitum.
Rant.  It took me two full days to weed out and fix all the crap people
sent me to get -mm1 into a state where it vaguely compiled and booted.  And
it's untested nonsense like this which wrecks the whole effort for many
testers.
I suppose this is as good as anything....
