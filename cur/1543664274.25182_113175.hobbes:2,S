I got noticed a few Oops's in the logs of my firewall/gateway box.
It's been running fine for months without any other oops and still
seems to be chugging away quite happily.
The box is am AMD K6233 with 192MB, realtek 8139 network card
connected to my LAN and a 3c509 connected to my ADSL router.
Running linux 2.4.20-rc1 on an up-to-date Debian stable.
My .config and decoded Oops are attached.  ksymoops through up some
warnings, not sure why as the kernel / System.map and running modules
should definately match.
Let me know if you need any more info.

Warning: You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will
assume that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running
right now and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
Warning (compare_maps): ksyms_base symbol sk_chk_filter_R__ver_sk_chk_filter not found in System.map.  Ignoring ksyms_base entry
Warning (compare_maps): ksyms_base symbol sk_run_filter_R__ver_sk_run_filter not found in System.map.  Ignoring ksyms_base entry
