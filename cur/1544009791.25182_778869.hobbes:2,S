Yes, I agree, my point was to fix the deadlock caused in the hierarchy
due to cpuset_migrate_mm(). If I understand correctly
1. This patch introduces no new bug, but the old bug remains. The
deadlock is fixed
2. We need this patch + your fix to completely solve the problem?
Could you also share how to reproduce the issue, I'll test on my end
as well.
Thanks for your help!
