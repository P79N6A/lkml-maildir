It would be pretty strange for plain old pagecache pages to leak in this
manner.  A few things come to mind.
- The above trace is indistinguishable from the normal situation of
  having a lot of pagecache floating about.  IOW: we don't know if the
  above pages have really leaked or not.
- It's sometimes possible for ext3 pages to remain alive (on the page
  LRU) after a truncate, but with no other references to them.  These pages
  are trivially reclaimable.  So even if you've deleted the files which the
  benchmark created, there _could_ be pages left over.  Although it would
  be unusual.
So what you should do before generating the leak tool output is to put
heavy memory pressure on the machine to try to get it to free up as much of
that pagecache as possible.  bzero(malloc(lots)) will do it - create a real
swapstorm, then do swapoff to kill remaining swapcache as well.
If we still see a lot of pages with the above trace then something really
broke.  Where does one get the appropriate dbench version?  How are you
mkfsing the filesystem?  Was mke2fs patched?  How is the benchmark being
invoked?
Thanks.
