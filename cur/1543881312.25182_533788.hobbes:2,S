It looks mostly good.  I wouldn't use the high bit to differentiate
the 64-bit operations, though.  Since we do not allow to apply it to
all operations the only effect will be that the compiler has a harder
time generating the code for the switch statement.  If you use
continuous values a simple jump table can be used and no conditionals.
 Smaller and faster.
