Subject: [PATCH 04/10] kobject: kobj->k_name verification fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The function 'kobject_add' tries to verify the name of
a new kobject instance is properly set before continuing.
    if (!kobj->k_name)
        kobj->k_name = kobj->name;
    if (!kobj->k_name) {
        pr_debug("kobject attempted to be registered with no name!\n");
        WARN_ON(1);
        return -EINVAL;
    }
The statement:
    if (!kobj->k_name) {
        pr_debug("kobject attempted to be registered with no name!\n");
        WARN_ON(1);
        return -EINVAL;
    }
is useless the way it is right now, because it can never be true. I
think the
code was intended to be:
    if (!kobj->k_name)
        kobj->k_name = kobj->name;
    if (!*kobj->k_name) {
        pr_debug("kobject attempted to be registered with no name!\n");
        WARN_ON(1);
        return -EINVAL;
    }
because this would make sure the kobj->name buffer has something in it.
So the missing '*' is just a typo. Although, I would much prefer
expression like:
    if (*kobj->k_name == '\0') {
        pr_debug("kobject attempted to be registered with no name!\n");
        WARN_ON(1);
        return -EINVAL;
    }
because this would've made the intention clear, in this patch I just restore
the missing '*' without changing the coding style of the function.
