Why is that "clearly wrong"?
The POSIX.1 standard says
B.6.4.2 Write to a File
..
A write is atomic if the whole amount written in one operation is not
interleaved with data from any other process. This is useful when there
are multiple writers sending data to a single reader.
What you ask for is an atomicity guarantee for read, but AFAICS neither
B.6.4.1 nor 6.4.1 require such a guarantee.
