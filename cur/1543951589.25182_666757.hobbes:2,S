I'm sure it does suck under heavy load, although I suppose you could
increase the start time.  But I wonder if that is the problem this
time?  Modern machines are so damned fast they actually take real effort
to load.  Actually, "make -j4" doesn't sound particularly heavy. 
There's huge disk i/o in a make.  Plenty of scheduling opportunities. 
Obviously I only know what everybody else here knows; but with so many
recent posts suggesting a scheduling fault has been introduced, I'm
expecting it to be that.
