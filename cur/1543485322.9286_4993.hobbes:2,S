There are other bugs and races too. 
They all should fixed in the patch at ftp.inr.ac.ru:/ip-routing/kernel-ss990203-2.2.1.dif.gz
If you find any bugs in this fixed version please report.

Definitely. In pre-slab based versions of Linux kfree_s() was just a 
macro for kfree, so there were still lots of bogus kfree_s()s. Unfortunately
Linux still doesn't have real regression testing so not all were catched :/
Anyways, it should be fixed in the patch mentioned above.

I don't see any hton[sl] in sk_run_filter.
