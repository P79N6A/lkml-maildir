I think the equivalent of symlinks would be good enough to get by on for
now for most linking of metafiles.  Maybe some years from now somebody
can fault me for saying this and write a patch to fix it to be better,
at which point I will be happy to concede the point.
So the basic principal here is, one can have hardlinks to directories
without cycles provided that one does not allow any child of the
directory to have a hardlink.  The question is, how cleanly can that
relaxed restriction be coded?
