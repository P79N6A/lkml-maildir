Setting vm_mapped_ratio to 20 seems to give a 'better' memory usage 
using my very contrived test - running a find will result in about 900Mb 
of dcache/icache, but then running a cat to /dev/null will shrink the 
dcache/icache down to between 100-300Mb - running the find and cat at 
the same time results in about the same dcache/icache usage.
I'll give this a go on the production NFS server and I'll see if it 
improves things.
