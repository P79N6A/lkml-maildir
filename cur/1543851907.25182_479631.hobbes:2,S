Subject: [2.6 patch] ext4_ext_split(): remove dead code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/6/46

The Coverity checker noted that this was dead code, since in all places 
above in this function, "err" is immediately checked.
