Assuming you are on an x86 box...
make allyesconfig will give you a config for same OS bit-size as you run.
make ARCH=i386 allyesconfig gives you a 32 bit config
make ARCH=x86_64 allyesconfig gives you a 64 bit config
make ARCH=x86 allyesconfig gives you a 32 bit config where you can select 64 bit.
It was seen as the best solution when unifying 32 and 64 bit stuff
and introducing support for ARCH=x86.
No-one has complained until now so most people seems to get it
or maybe they are just silent.
