Actually, if these patches do make it into -mm, then patches 1-4 should
make it into Linus's tree. That will make Andrews maintenance of these
patches much easier, since they would make the -mm changes not so
intrusive.
Since the stripping out of tasklets is more of a cosmetic change and
does not change functionality of the kernel, I don't see why it can't
make it up to Linus's tree. Especially if we are planning on removing
tasklets all together.
