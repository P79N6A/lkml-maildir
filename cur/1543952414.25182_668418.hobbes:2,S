A depends is horrible from the user point of view as it hides the 
feature completely if paravirt is not enabled.  So your original 
workaround is probably best.
Or maybe
   depends on PARAVIRT_CAPABLE
   selects PARAVIRT
Where PARAVIRT_CAPABLE is a synonym for !(X86_REMOVE_ME || 
X86_TOTAL_SILLYNESS), so we don't have to repeat it everywhere.
