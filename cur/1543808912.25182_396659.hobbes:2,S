Not necessarily - it would be easier for userspace programs if we had
a separate class in sysfs - /sys/class/cdrom. The problem with this
approach is that we do not allow a device belong o several classes
without introducing intermediate class devices (I mean a DVD+RW shoudl
probably belong to classes cdrom, dvdrom, cdwriter and dvdwriter).
