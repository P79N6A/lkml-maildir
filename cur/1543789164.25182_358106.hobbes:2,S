Subject: [PATCH 2.6.14-rc4] kbuild: once again use Makefiles in obj tree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I believe that I have found and fixed the problem that I encountered earlier this week
with Makefiles not being used from the objects tree as they had been in every 2.6 kernel
I have worked with since 2.6.5. I I view this as a regression in 2.6.14-rc4. I believe
that the following patch fixes it.
