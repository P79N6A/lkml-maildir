Perhaps Christoph's right it's just wild ideas, but see below.
You both seem to agree the first theory of the tree_lock is bogus
as it's lockless for find_get_page.
The second theory of why it shouldn't happen thanks to the refcount
freezing is bogus too...
CPU0 migrate.c			CPU1 filemap.c
-------				----------
				find_get_page
				radix_tree_lookup_slot returns the oldpage
page_count still = expected_count
freeze_ref (oldpage->count = 0)
radix_tree_replace (too late, other side already got the oldpage)
unfreeze_ref (oldpage->count = 2)
				page_cache_get_speculative(old_page)
				set count to 3 and succeeds
Admittedly I couldn't understand what the freeze_ref was about, I
thought it was something related to the radix tree internals (which I
didn't check as they weren't relevant at that point besides being
lockless) as there was nothing inside that freeze/unfreeze critical
section that could affect find_get_page, so I ignored it. If if was
meant to stop find_get_page to get the oldpage it clearly isn't
working.
Perhaps I'm still missing something...
If I'm right my suggested fix is to simply change the
remove_migration_ptes to set the pte to point to the swapcache,
instead of leaving the swapentry in it. That will make do_swap_page
bailout like every other path in memory.c in the pte_same check, and
additionally it'll avoid an unnecessary minor fault.
