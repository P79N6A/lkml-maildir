Thanks, so you are changing the semantics. It may be a good idea, though I have
no idea which is more valuable for the people, or whether this change is ok for
the majority, or if it makes linux in line with other UNIX behaviors. Sorry, I
cannot comment on this.

Sure. It is hard to collect the exact readahead hit values, for the pages from
active list and pages newly allocated are not distinguishable. But I do manage
to collect the short term values for each readahead, which are sufficient most
of the time.
