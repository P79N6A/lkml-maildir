I thought Karim said that this was a form of data compression.

I do.  When someone has been working on a real-world project for several
years we *need* to understand all the problems which that person
encountered before we can competently review the implementation.  Surely
you've been there before: you throw out all the old stuff, write a new one
and once you've addressed all the warts and corner cases and
weird-but-valid requirements it ends up with the same complexity as the
original.
