Hi,
I'd like to connect some self made hardware to the parallel port and 
read the values of the dataline using linux. Can this be done in 
userspace or do I have to write kernel code to do so? I'm currently 
thinking of writing a device like lp, which in turn uses the parport 
device. Does this sound like a good idea?
Regards, Uwe
