Subject: [PATCH]Problems with compling 2.4.14 on SMP and kernel versioning on modules set.

I could not compile a UP (non-SMP) kernel on my system, with module
versioning set, the problem was traced to ksyms.c
 * Herein lies all the functions/variables that are "exported" for linkage
 * with dynamically loaded kernel modules.
 *                      Jon.
 *
Now linux/module.h is included in ksyms.c
Below is a patch for compiling a NON-SMP kernel in 2.4.14. If this is
correct, please apply. In this patch, the include of linux/module.h
(which redifines smp_num_cpus based on kernel versioning) has been moved
below the include of linux/kernel_stat.h
