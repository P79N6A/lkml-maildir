Here's my problem...
I've been trying build a router box from an old 486 and it has one quite
exotic ethernet card. It doesn't have a name anywhere on a card, but i
guess the most important chip on card is Winbond W24129AS-35. I haven't
found any drivers yet for Linux. Some forums say, that this card is
NE2000 compatible, but insmod ne fails (i attached right io and irq).
Thanks in advance :)
