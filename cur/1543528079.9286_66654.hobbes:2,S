My sound stopped working on my laptop as of 2.2.15pre10
I regularly listen to mp3's via xmms.
The clue to the problem lies in:
ad1848: Unable to allocate IRQ
ad1848: Interrupt test failed (IRQ10)
This message sort of worries me:
Intel PCIC probe: 
  TI 1131 PCI-to-CardBus at slot 00:07, mem 0x68000000
      host opts [0]: [ring] [isa irq] [pci irq 10] [lat 168/176] [bus 32/34]
      host opts [1]: [ring] [isa irq] [pci irq 10] [lat 168/176] [bus 35/37]
      ISA irqs (scanned) = 5,7,9 PCI status changes
Being a laptop, none of my hardware has changed.
I regularly update 2.2.15preXX and the pcmcia utilities.
I switched PCMCIA to poll mode just in case.  I also doubled checked
the BIOS settings for the sound config to make sure it was still
set to IRQ 10.
I do believe I switch
2.2.15pre9/pcmcia 3.1.10 to 2.2.15pre10/pcmcia 3.1.11 at the same time.
