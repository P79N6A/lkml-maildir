For example on Pentium4 in the function elv_next_request() the line
            struct request *rq =
q->elevator->ops->elevator_next_req_fn(q);
before patch had required 11% of function running time as oprofile
reports
           %
    26  0.0457 :c0270ecb:       mov    0xc(%edi),%eax
  3455  6.0670 :c0270ece:       mov    (%eax),%eax
  2848  5.0011 :c0270ed0:       mov    %edi,(%esp)
  1538  2.7008 :c0270ed3:       call   *0xc(%eax)
	A patch which would delete all indirect calls was tryed
        struct request *rq = q->elevator_cp.ops.elevator_next_req_fn(q);
     9  0.0224 :c0270eea:       mov    %edi,(%esp)
  3814  9.4793 :c0270eed:       call   *0x18(%edi)
But additional memory would be needed for 'ops' in each queue. The
intermediate (proposed) patch has the same timing effect but saves some
memory:
	struct request *rq =
q->elevator_cp.ops->elevator_next_req_fn(q);

ffffffff802a8b97:       49 8b 44 24 18          mov    0x18(%r12),%rax
ffffffff802a8b9c:       4c 89 e7                mov    %r12,%rdi
ffffffff802a8b9f:       ff 50 18                callq  *0x18(%rax)
For Itanium the difference is huge:

	After patching there is no object code for considered line. It
is scattered mixed with other source code lines.
