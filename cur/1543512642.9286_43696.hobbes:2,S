It's not my standard, but another example of an ugly kludge that works and
is useful nevertheless.

Nobody is saying it _must_ be devfs (at least I'm not). Devfs is a
possible solution though, and we have it right now, and it makes a lot of
other things easier, especially for newbies.
Advanced users who for whatever reasons don't like it can just turn it
off.

Cleanly: granted, this is a problem.
Kludgy: possible without any major implications.

Have a look at FreeBSD 4.0-CURRENT to see an example of a working devfs
that is more widely in use than the Linux patches...

True.

That's a matter of opinion. You can consider anything bload. We don't
really "need" kmod, /dev/pts, a.out (anyone still using that?),
chipset-specific IDE support, khttpd, knfsd, isapnp or pcmcia (the latter
two have been implemented without the main kernel supporting them) in the
kernel either - are all of those bloat too?

How so?
I haven't seen stability problems with devfs even though I'm using it on
Linux and FreeBSD.
Unless you think of someone editing the permissions file (writable by root
only), I don't see security problems either - and once someone can write
to a root-writable file, you're in trouble anyways.
Am I missing something?

Really? I, for example, use PCMCIA to connect my notebook with a D-Link
DE640 to my home network, or with a Trust EtherLink PCMCIA at office...
With USB hardware becoming more common, we'll see more problems like that
- connecting computers (especially notebooks) to (different) printers
everywhere, and that's just one of the examples.

This is different, because /dev/fd0 is the floppy drive, not the diskette.
You still need to access /dev/fd0 if you want to probe if there is a
floppy drive, or if you need to check if there's a diskette in it, and
such.
But you *don't* necessarily want to have /dev/usbprinter109 when the
specified USB printer is not connected.

That's possible only because the Zip drive (parallel port, I presume)
always connects at the same place. This is not guaranteed for connecting
to chains of USB hardware.

/proc/devices could be extended to give the same functionality, yes.

FreeBSD has taken up the solution, and experience shows that mostly
anything that gets into one BSD will be ported to the other BSDs.

Until you start writing shell scripts that you want to use on your Linux
and FreeBSD boxes without having to modify all the names.
I agree this is not an important issue though.

Right. If. It isn't. Read the patch.
