Subject: getting uninterruptible sleep processes after upgrade from 2.6.20.20 to 2.6.24.2

Hello!
One week ago we upgraded about 300 servers from 2.6.20.20 to 2.6.24.2.
Now we get sometimes dozent of processes in state DN. The system is 
completely idle - but the load is 20 or 90 or whatever. And it can only 
be "repaired" by rebooting the system.
I'm NOT on the LIST so please CC me.
Thanks.
Stefan
