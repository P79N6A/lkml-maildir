Humm, if it (the sector error) continues.  I'm rather convinced that was a one 
time transient item caused by doing so many hardware resets.  It has not 
repeated in subsequent stanzas of this error.  Several times it went away 
while the drives long self test was in progress, and the resets that go with 
the reboot, or one of these errors seems to stop the long test, which from my 
reading, should resume with no delay, but maybe that only applies to a 
powerdown restart, which I haven't been doing.  The last such error was about 
11 hours ago now. I just started another long test, which if ok, should clear 
the stuff its showing now because the test was interrupted.  It has passed 
that test twice before in the last 36 hours.
Thanks Mark.
