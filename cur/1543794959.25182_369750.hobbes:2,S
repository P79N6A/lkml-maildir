Gene has sent me a copy of his .config ... here are the relevant lines:
[snip]
CONFIG_VIDEO_CX88=m
CONFIG_VIDEO_CX88_DVB=m
# CONFIG_VIDEO_CX88_DVB_ALL_FRONTENDS is not set
# CONFIG_VIDEO_CX88_DVB_MT352 is not set
CONFIG_VIDEO_CX88_DVB_OR51132=m
# CONFIG_VIDEO_CX88_DVB_CX22702 is not set
# CONFIG_VIDEO_CX88_DVB_LGDT330X is not set
# CONFIG_VIDEO_CX88_DVB_NXT200X is not set

CONFIG_DVB_NXT2002=m
# CONFIG_DVB_NXT200X is not set
# CONFIG_DVB_OR51211 is not set
CONFIG_DVB_OR51132=m
# CONFIG_DVB_BCM3510 is not set
CONFIG_DVB_LGDT330X=m

A configuration like this should have compiled cx88-dvb without any 
references to nxt200x at all.
Gene, do you have v4l-kernel cvs installed on top of kernel 2.6.15-rc2?  
Unless I'm missing something, it seems that this is the only way that 
you could have nxt200x support in cx88-dvb without having built the 
nxt200x module itself.  The v4l-kernel cvs build environment has nxt200x 
enabled by default when building against kernels 2.6.15 and later.
If this is true, then you can either disable nxt200x in 
v4l-kernel/v4l/Makefile, or re-build the cvs modules using the dvb + v4l 
merged-tree build environment. 
http://linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/How_to_build_from_CVS
This would, in effect, give the same result as if you had selected 
CONFIG_VIDEO_CX88_DVB_ALL_FRONTENDS (selected by default in Kconfig)
...or maybe you initially started a kernel build with the nxt200x module 
selected, then stopped the compile, unselected nxt200x, and continued 
the build process without cleaning in between, and after cx88-dvb had 
already been built?  Hmm... I guess that might be a bit far-fetched... 
but to be sure, you can wipe out your kernel tree and rebuild it again 
from scratch using the same .config .
If my assumption above is incorrect, then this will need to be looked 
into a bit deeper.  Please, let me know.
Regards,
Michael Krufky
