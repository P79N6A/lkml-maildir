The bitmap of memory, perhaps, I'll let wli speak to that one.  The page
tables shouldn't need to be fixed-sized like what you're proposing;
although the current patch doesn't make use of it, I'd like to in the
future, and this would make it impossible.

For what good?  Seriously... you're just pushing further into the kernel
the point where you will run completely out of memory during
initialization -- this case dynamic.
There is absolutely no use in trying to pointf*ck this.  Really.
