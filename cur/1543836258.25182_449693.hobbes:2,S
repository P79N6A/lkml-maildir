Hmm. I reviewed them a bit, and I couldn't find any problems.
However, my ia64 box is same of his. And emulation environment is very
close too. So, my perspective must be very similar from him.
I think my review is not enough. Keith-san's test is better if he can.
Anyway, I'll test them with -mm. Something different environment
may be good for test.
Thanks.
