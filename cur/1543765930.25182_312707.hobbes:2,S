I remember finding a path through void __sched schedule(void) that
took a branch through the goto need_resched; that would result in this.
I takes a bit of mental gymnastics to see how this might happen.
FWIW, I can send you a debug session showing all cpu's idle and 44 dead 
processes sitting in do_exit().  All but two of these were Java threads,
so this seems to be some sort of thread-scheduling subtlty.  (the two
that weren't java threads were a find|grep pair that must have gotten 
tangled in.)
Given that the patch seems to fix the problem, I didn't dig much deeper.
