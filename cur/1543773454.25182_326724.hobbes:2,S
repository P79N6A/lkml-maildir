Subject: 2.6.12-git1 broken on x86_64 (works on 2.6.12)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/20/218

Fails to reboot, see:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mbligh/abat/6035/debug/console.log
basically:
VFS: Cannot open root device "sda1" or unknown-block(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
Looks like it didn't find the SCSI card at all ... MPT fusion, IIRC.
I'll poke at it a bit tommorow, but if you've got any good guesses as
to what broke it, let me know (hopefully something trivial like config
options).
