Well, devfs does have some abilities udev doesn't: hotplug/udev doesn't detect 
everything, and can result in rarer or non-PnP devices not being 
automatically available; devfs has the effect of trying to load a module when 
a program looks for the devices it provides-- while it can cause problems, it 
does have a possibility to work better. Interesting effects of switching my 
desktop from devfs to udev:
1. my DVD burners are left uninitialized until I manually modprobe ide-cd or 
(more recently) ide-scsi
2. my sound card is autodetected and the drivers loaded, but the OSS emulation 
modules are omitted; with devfs, they would be autoloaded when an app tried 
to use OSS
devfs also has the advantage of keeping the module info all in one place-- the 
kernel or the module. In particular, with udev the detection and /dev info is 
scattered into different locations of the filesystem. This can probably be 
fixed easily simply by having udev read such info from modules or via a /sys 
entry, though.
