then I'm the only one and I could have been biased because rmap.c is
including 99% of code for the pte based rmap, and my objrmap.c is including
99% of code for the objrect based _reverse_mappings_, still objrmap.c is
a more appropriate name for that stuff IMO (especially if somebody else
is mistaken as I am using the word rmap to mean the current 2.6 code in
mm/rmap.c).
