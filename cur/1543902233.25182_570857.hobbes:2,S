Come to think about this, doesn't the old code trigger this problem too, 
if you use CDROMEJECT or CDROMCLOSETRAY on a IDE disk (as opposed to an 
IDE CD-ROM)?
But I'll revert that part of it for now, and at least this issue won't be 
anything new. In the meantime, BSG has also gotten some other fixes, most 
notably about them the fact that it's not marked default any more, and 
properly warning about its EXPERIMENTAL status..
