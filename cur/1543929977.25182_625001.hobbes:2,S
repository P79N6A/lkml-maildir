The GT-64120 has remapping register which the GT-64111 is lacking.  So
the way things are I don't see how it would be possibly to generate an
I/O port address below GT_DEF_PCI0_IO_BASE (0x10000000) on that system
controller.
Which of course mean any sort of device that requires legacy I/O port
addressing is out of question unless one intentionally (ab-)uses aliases
due to only partial decoding of the I/O port address.  Which would mean
no chance of using legacy I/O port devices with the Galileo.
There must be something I'm missing here, I just can't believe somebody
could possibly design such a lunatic system controller.
