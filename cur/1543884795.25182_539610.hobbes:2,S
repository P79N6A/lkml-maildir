I looked at lxr.linux.no - so probarly an outdated version.

I have applied your patch and tried it out.
The reason for the problem is the placeholder directory mac80211.
kbuild will not waste time building built-in.o for a directory where
it is not necessary. So for mac80211 no built-in.o is created since there
is no need. The only reference is to a module.
The quick-and-dirty workaround is to add a single 
obj-n := xx
in mac80211/Makefile and kbuild is happy again.
I could teach kbuild to create built-in.o also in the case
where we refer to a subdirectory only. But then we would end up with a built-in.o
in all directories where we have a kbuild MAkefile (almost) and that is
not desireable.
So I recommend the proposed workaround for now with a proper comment.
