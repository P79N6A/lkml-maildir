OK, my real last word on the subject.
When the kernel is running on behalf of a user process, there is more
context than just the struct task_struct part of current.  There is a
kernel stack, which must be per process since each process can have
its own call chain of kernel functions.
By all means, see switch_to().  Look at what it does to ESP.
