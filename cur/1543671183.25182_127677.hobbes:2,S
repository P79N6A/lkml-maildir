Thanks for clarifying this ! So, would you agree with the following
addition to Documentation/Changes ?
  ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) is now the preferred
  architecture for sound support, instead of the older OSS (Open
  Sound System). Note that, in ALSA, all volume settings default
  to zero, and all channels default to being "muted".
  User space therefore needs to explicitly increase the volume,
  and "unmute" the respective audio channels before any sound
  can be heard. 
  Mixers not explicitly supporting the "mute" functionality will
  usually "unmute" sources when setting the volume to a value
  above zero.
  More information about ALSA, including configuration and OSS
  compatibility, can be found in Documentation/sound/alsa/

I couldn't agree more.
