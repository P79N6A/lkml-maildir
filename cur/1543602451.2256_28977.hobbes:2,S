	K6-333 128M ram
	2.4.9-ac15 my impression: Well, running mutt with 80M
folder open, desktop with several aterms and netscape with a few
windows open, I started building a kernel in one term, and a
'find / -type f -exec md5sum {}' in another, then started reading
the mail, and occasionally jumping around the virtual desktop,
exposing netscapes... (this is pretty much my normal working
load, except for the find.)
	I thought it worked very well; exposed netscapes were
either just there, or drew almost instantly. (other kernels I
have used, under the same load would usually take quite a bit
longer for exposed netscape to draw itself.) 'interactiveness'
seemed good.
	Then, I read a post in this thread about swap being
funny. I noticed that no swap was being reported as used all
during my test. So, I forced the issue with an endless malloc.
Very quickly, the system seems to freeze, and the disk is
yammering away. I was waiting for the OOM killer to kick in,
but it never did. <alt><sysrq> works well, and I used it to print
out the Mem stats after several minutes. Eventually, I used
sysrq to sync and kill (couldnt get it to reBoot, though).
	Im not complaining-- Im just curious why no OOM killing, 
and the Mem stats report 337148k swap free (I have 337168k).
Does this memmory report look  proper for a machine thrashing
itself to death from endless mallocs?
