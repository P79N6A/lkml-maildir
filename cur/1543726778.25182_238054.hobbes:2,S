i've uploaded the preempt-timing patch (relative to -O2):
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/preempt-timing-on-2.6.8-rc2-O2
QuickStart for those who havent used it yet: enable PREEMPT_TIMING in
.config and add preempt_thresh=1000 [== 1000 usec threshold] to the
kernel's boot options. 
i changed the original patch to make it a bit more usable - the
threshold can be changed runtime via /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_thresh,
and the units are microseconds not milliseconds.
the timings should be pretty accurate in vp=0,1,2,3 modes as well.
Note that this patch only measures latencies of critical sections
(preempt-off sections), not other latencies that occur when running
!CONFIG_PREEMPT or with kernel_preemption=0.
