No. You should initialise the hardware completely when the driver is 
reloaded. Although the expected case is that the levels just happen to be 
the same as the last time the module was loaded, you can't know that the 
machine hasn't been suspended and resumed since then.

Don't troll, James. Reread the thread and see why doing it in userspace is 
too late.
