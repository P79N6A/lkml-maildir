Just for the record, I've now re-integrated those changes in a test kernel
that I booted on my 10gig machines. I have updated my user-space code in
haproxy to run a new series of tests. Eventhough there is a memcpy(), the
results are EXCELLENT (on a C2D 2.66 GHz using Myricom's Myri10GE NICs) :
  - 4.8 Gbps at 100% CPU using MTU=1500 without LRO
    (3.2 Gbps at 100% CPU without splice)
  - 9.2 Gbps at 50% CPU using MTU=1500 with LRO
  - 10 Gbps at 20% CPU using MTU=9000 without LRO (7 Gbps at 100% CPU without
    splice)
  - 10 Gbps at 15% CPU using MTU=9000 with LRO
These last ones are really impressive. While I had already observed such
performance on the Myri10GE with Tux, it's the first time I can reach that
level with so little CPU usage in haproxy !
So I think that the memcpy() workaround might be a non-issue for some time.
I agree it's not beautiful but it works pretty well for now.
The 3 patches I used on top of 2.6.27.10 were the fix to return 0 intead of
-EAGAIN on end of read, the one to process multiple skbs at once, and Dave's
last patch based on Jarek's workaround for the corruption issue.
Cheers,
Willy
