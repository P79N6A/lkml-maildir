And wouldn't it be nice to have one 'policy enforcing tool' or whatever
that you feed it policy_desktop.txt, policy_embedded_in_my_fridge.txt or
policy_enterprise.txt ?
And while you know the ordering for your one board, it's not the same as
that other board there, nor that third board just behind you, and so on.
So getting passed in some sort of tree (or more correctly DAG) and
dealing with it with some more generic code sure sounds nice.
