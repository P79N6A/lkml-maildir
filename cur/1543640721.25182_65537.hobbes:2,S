For the record, I do not think the blanket rewrite is a good idea.
I did it for broken devices only, governed by a new quirk flag,
and this is what we currently ship.
Matt reviewed what I did, but decided it would be cleaner
to rewrite commands always. I did not go on a roll against it because:
 1. 2.5 is supposed to be somewhat broken;
 2. Matt is the module maintainer, he knows what he's doing.
