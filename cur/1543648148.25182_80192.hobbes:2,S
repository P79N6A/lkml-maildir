Hi!
I managed to kill filesystem on my omnibook... Now I'm pretty sure
most of data should be undamaged [I did not do any long writes to it],
but mount refuses to mount it and e2fsck refuses that, too.
fsck /dev/hda4
fsck 1.24a (02-Sep-2001)
...
try running...:
	e2fsck -b 8193.
e2fsck -b 8193 /dev/hda4
....suggests me to run e2fsck -b 8193. Too bad. debugfs refuses to
mount it, too. How do I get my data back?
