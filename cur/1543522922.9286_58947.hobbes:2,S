I just tried it.  I went into a random dir, and downloaded a
single small file (README).  It worked no prob.  I then tried
tagging 2 files and downloading.  Both downloaded ok, with no
hanging problems...  This is using 2.2.14, and midnight
commander:
mc-4.5.40-2
All seemed ok, and it was pretty quick too.  My only complaint
was all the symlinks!  Ouch!  Every dir I went in was about 99%
symlinks...  Must be CDROM's I take it...
Take care,
TTYL
