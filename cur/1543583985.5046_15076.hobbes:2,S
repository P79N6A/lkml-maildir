I didn't pick-up on the fact that you planned on have other computers
listening with those addresses.
This won't work without support from your routing device if you actually
have hosts on the addresses, just because of ARP.
You can make this work, if, you can control and configure the router
  1. You can configure your router to direct the needed ports to your Linux
	box and not the real hosts. (Linux can do this)
If you can firewall on the victim boxes, you could block their 'not
reachable' reply, but that doesn't solve ARP. You could probably make a
trivial change to Linux and run it in promiscuous mode to achieve this. It's
more likely the first will be a better option for you.
What are you doing anyways? :)
