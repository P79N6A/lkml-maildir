Maybe you did something wrong :-) Seriously, maybe you're right, and
maybe not. I'd like to find out, and having the infrastructure to get
FS access events will help in that (as well as your preferred
approach: see below). If I am digging into a rathole, I'll do it with
my eyese open ;-)

Well, on my machines anyway, the discs rattle an awful lot during
bootup. Not just little adjacent seeks, but big, partition crossing
seeks.

Yeah, we need a decent unfragmenter. We can do that now with bmap().
But to speed up boots, for example, we need to lay all the inodes that
are accessed during boot in one contiguous chunk on the disc. Again,
we need to know which files are being accessed to know that.
/proc/fsaccess would tell us that.
The down side of just relying on contiguous files is that some files
(especially bloated C libraries) are not fully used. I would not be at
all surprised if more than 75% of glibc is not (or rarely) used.
There's a lot of stuff in there that isn't used very often.
However, a *refragmenter* might be interesting. Find out which blocks
in which files are actually used during boot, and lay just those out
in a contiguous section. *That* would smoke!
