No. The auth_domain_lock was released after the call to
auth_domain_find(), and thus there is no guarantee that the entry is
still referenced when you get round to that second call to
auth_domain_put(). Testing for hlist_unhashed() and then removing the
entry from the lookup table while under the spin lock fixes this
problem: it ensures that you only call auth_domain_put() once if some
other process has raced you.
Actually, making a helper "auth_domain_find_and_unhash()" would probably
be even more efficient in this case, since that would enable you to
reduce the auth_domain_lock usage further.
Cheers,
