Subject: [PATCH] clarify timer macros for jiffies wrap
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, Alan,
I don't know if you were following the 64-bit jiffies thread, but it came
out that initializing jiffies to a pre-wrap state causes system instability,
partly caused by failure to handle jiffies wrap properly.
I started checking a bunch of code for improper timer wrap handling and
thought I would add this patch to clarify the usage of the time_defore()
and time_after() macros so that it is clearer how to use them.  I always
have to sit down and think about how to use these macros, so we may
as well make it clear in the comment.  I expanded the time_before{_eq}
definitions as it makes it easier to see which one to use when existing
code to use one of the macros.
I also put a pointer to these macros at the jiffies definition, so people
are more likely to use them.
I will be sending patches for fixing up jiffies comparisons separately.
As the comment at the time_{before,after} macros says, I'm changing all
comparisons of jiffies values to use these macros (even if they are
correctly done) so that (a) it insulates driver code if we change to a
64-bit jiffies value, and (b) makes people more aware that they should
always use these macros when dealing with jiffies.
Cheers, Andreas
