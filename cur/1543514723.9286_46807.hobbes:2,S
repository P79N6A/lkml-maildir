Stephen,
What everyone is side-stepping is that the interface between the drivers
and the buffer cache is incestuous -- this prevents folks from building
async I/O based FS's on Linux.  The solution is not a simple one -- the
drivers and buffer cache interface needs to be changed to elimnate these
dependencies so.
