Subject: [PATCH] Add ENOSYS into sys_io_cancel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/11/213

Previously sent via private mail that doesn't seem to go thru - resend 
via office mailer.
Note that other than few exceptions, most of the current filesystem 
and/or drivers do not have aio cancel specifically defined 
(kiob->ki_cancel field is mostly NULL). However, sys_io_cancel system 
call universally sets return code to -EGAIN. This gives applications a 
wrong impression that this call is implemented but just never works. We 
have customer inquires about this issue.
Upload a trivial patch to address this confusion.
