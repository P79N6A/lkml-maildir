Exactly the same thing that happened before.  If you look at
wake_up_process it's just a tiny wrapper around try_to_wake_up.
And wake_up expands to __wake_up expaneds to __wake_up_common
which just walks the list of threads attached to the waitqueue
and then calls curr->func, which expands to try_to_wake_up.
So when your thread still is in running state nothing changes.
If your thread is not in running state it'll get woken by both
variants.
