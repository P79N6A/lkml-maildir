As a historyless patchset, this gets the merge all wrong.
If the reason to put this in tree is to keep the kernel just working
then there is a great big hole of 40 patches for git bisect to find.

If they are in the wrong order then that is not good enough.
The patch names and descriptions are wrong because the are from
the klibc git tree.

This looks to be 04-powerpc-set-klibc-arch

Make the "move stuff i need" and make it first

I didn't look, this corrects whitespace before patching? ok early

What does this do?  No Help, no description, and doesn't trigger
anything in this patch.

What does this do?  No Help, no description, and doesn't do anything
in the curreent patch

	where is x86 and x86_64 ?
	oh you deleted and did not put that back
> 18-klibc-inkernel-merge-s390s390x-4.patch
	This patchname is meaningless.
	The description in the patch is worse.
	It looks like it should be 18-s390-set-klibcarch
Hmm... i didn't find the patch removig usr/Makefile, just adding
usr/Kbuild.   usr/Kbuild should be a diff against the existing
usr/Makefile, whcih can be renamed.
As a guess here would be my order and renames:
07-eliminate-unnecessary-whitespace-delta-vs-linus-tree.patch
	This should be making the delta the right way
06-re-create-root-dev-too-many-architectures-need-it-.patch
	nee do-mounts-is-goiing-move-root-dev
	I think initramfs.c might be a temporary home
16-sparc64-transmit-arch-specific-options-to-kinit-via-arch-cmd.patch
17-sparc32-transfer-arch-specific-options-to-arch-cmd.patch
	keep the global varables, make the arch_initcall global, and keep
	the code in x86 and x86-64 setup.c
	"export-arch-set-ramdiskflags-to-early-userspace"
