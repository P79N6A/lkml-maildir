ADSL is still full duplex, just not symetrical.
If I understand cvsup's operation enough, it uses the fact it 
understands what a CVS repository is to send to the server the revisions 
available for a given file. The lets the server know which parts of the 
file it needs to send back. The uplink side receives a very low 
utilization compared to the downlink side. In practice, I'm using cvsup 
for the Wine repository over an ADSL (1.5M down, I don't remeber whether 
it's 64 or 128K up), and am very pleased from it. Admitebly, I was not a 
very enthusiastic rsync convert, so I can't tell you how much faster 
cvsup is.
If you want an official benchmark, you'll have to wait a few days for my 
Wine rep. to fall out of synch. I should note the cvsup is useless if 
all your'e going to do is get the initial version. If I recall 
correctly, it actually use rsync to transfer files it cannot parse as 
CVS files, which means that initial repository retrieval should be 
equally fast with both.
