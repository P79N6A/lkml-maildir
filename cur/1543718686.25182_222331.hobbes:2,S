For me it works ok
Running tvtime with 2.6.6-mm5 load average 26 (twenty six) it
works 
almost perfect (no frame skipped -- at least not reported by
tvtime)
at full rate (50 frames/sec). Computer: AMD Duron 700 MHz, 256MB
Ram,
VIA KT133 chipset, AGP 4x, Ati Radeon 7200 
Maybe your users are renicing tvtime ?
AFAIK it is not recommended to renice a process which uses X
server and 
wants realtime processing 
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Take a look at this. Is tvtime's fault (X server does'n have the
chance to display what tvtime processed because tvtime gets
almost all the cpu)

I hope the line above answers your question

P.S. Load average is that high because i run freenet
 
http://freenet.sourceforge.net
 -- lots of java processes
