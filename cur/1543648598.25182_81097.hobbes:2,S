   Finally, I was under the impression that Greg KH agreed that it is 
   possible to eliminate this overhead?  Maybe I recall incorrectly.
The agreement was that it would be nice, we also agreed
that it's a very difficult thing to implement.
I'm now leaning more towards something like what Al Viro
hinted at earlier, creating generic per-file/fd attributes.
This kind of stuff.
