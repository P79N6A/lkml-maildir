This is even better than plain O6-int. Everything is nearly perfect. 
One thing I dislike a bit is that on my slow PIII 700Mhz, moving a
medium-sized window over Evolution 1.4.3 main window (displaying my
INBOX full of messages) makes the window movement a little jumpy
(Evolution 1.4.3 is well-known to be a serious CPU hogger when
repainting windows).
Renicing X to -20 helps a little with the jumpiness.
Nice work, indeed!
