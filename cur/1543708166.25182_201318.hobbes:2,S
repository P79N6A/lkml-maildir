This is exactly the way it works. The AGP bridge is
a replicated per-CPU thing, along with the memory.
Good boards have a BIOS option marked "Linux only"
that lets you choose an IO-MMU window size ranging
from 32 MB to 2 GB. Direct your 32-bit PCI DMA
into that window and you get an IO-MMU.
Memory can be interleaved across the CPUs or not,
on 4 kB boundries. It's a BIOS option, though some
insane code could be written to change the setting.
Setting up only one of the IO-MMUs would be neat.
