	In case anyone is intersted, here is a sample implementation
that compiles.  I do not know if it works.  I have renamed it
recycle_bio.  This version allocates a bio on the stack (56 bytes
on x86).  I also wrote a version that avoided the stack allocation,
but added a field "void *bi_destructor_private;" to struct bio.
