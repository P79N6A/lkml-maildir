OK... It could be dealt with analog of defragmentation-on-write a-la *BSD,
but that's a different story. Oh, well... I still think that we would
benefit from doing normal prealloc for all objects, though. In addition
to persistent prealloc for directories, that is - the latter will become
faster and ext2_alloc_block() will become simpler.
BTW, what inumber do you want for whiteouts? IIRC, we decided to use
the same entry type as UFS does (14), but I don't remember what was
the decision on inumber. UFS uses 1 for them, is it OK with you?
Al, putting together fs patches for -bird...
