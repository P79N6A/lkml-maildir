Hello,
I just want to let other know that kernel 2.2.18 does not work properly (*)
on my box if I compile it with egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2
release). Instead gcc-2.7.2.3 works ok.
(*) the network driver PCI NE2000 does not work with all three cards. It
just sees them but they do not work.
