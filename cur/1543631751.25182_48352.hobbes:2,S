Hi.
I have Radeon VE and I have tried to run framebuffer with Alan's
version of kernel: 2.4.19-pre8-ac5. Unfortunately it doesn't work fine for me:
I have very bad refresh, the consoles are switched with change of display mode.
The cursor is coloured and has different colours on each console and so on.  
I had the same problems wth the kernels 2.4.18 and 2.4.19-preX untill I found
the patch made by Peter Horton (posted on this list). With this patch I had
good support of framebuffer in any kernel from 2.4.19-pre2 up. I was hoping,
that latest -ac branch kernel have this patch included but it seems not.  
With Peter's patch my card and framebuffer works fine while with -ac kernel it
doesn't.
