I'm curious, Dr. von Brand; have you considered stickybit + immutable? (as
explained in my recent treatise to Richard ;-)  It solves a lot of
problems and gives us: 
- a MUCH truer implementation of capabilities
- as much compatibility as possible while still being a capabilities-based
system
Also, my guess is that you are actually saying 'capabilities should be
stored as metadata in the fs'.
