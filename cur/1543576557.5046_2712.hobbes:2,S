yeah i believe that natsemi driver is supposed to work with that 311 card,
although i have heard of issues with that now and then.  to be honest i
haven't followed very closely, as i don't use those cards/chips.  that
scyld.com page should have all the info you need, as well as info on an
accompianing mailing list for further help.
if whatever distro/kernel you're using already has a compiled natsemi
driver you can just try it out by messing with /etc/conf.modules or
/etc/modules.conf or whatever proper files your distribution uses.
