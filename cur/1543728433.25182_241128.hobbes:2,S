There are two problems:
1) If A has no prompt it's not visible and so it's dependency is 'n', this 
means a number of symbols wouldn't be visible anymore.
2) It would change the bahaviour of symbols, which already do multiple 
selects (e.g. CONFIG_INET_AH), the select of CRYPTO would be useless, as 
it would only become visible, when CRYPTO is enabled. This means such 
selects wouldn't be possible anymore.
This really needs a different (but similiar) mechanism, what I have in 
mind is something like this:
config A
	autoselect
config B
	depends on A
For the visibility calculation A is set to y and A is automatically 
selected if any symbol, which depends on A, is enabled.

xconfig has something like this, if you enable 'Debug Info', although it 
rather dumps the internal representation.
Adding something like this to menuconfig, would mean hacking lxdialog, 
which is rather at the bottom of the list of things I want to do. :)
