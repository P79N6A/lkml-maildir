as an outside observer during that time it looked like Linus was rejecting
patches from Rik (at least in part) becouse the reasoning behind them
wasn't fully explained and it appeared to be deteriorating into 'tweak
these magic numbers to fix problem A, discover that that caused problem B,
tweak them again to fix B anc cause C .... tweak them again to fix J and
cause A' type circles with nobody (other then possibly rik) understanding
what was really causing the problems (at least if they did understand them
they weren't posted here)
the fundamental problem was that while the VM would work well most of the
time, once in a while it would hit a pathalogical condition that would
lockup the machine completely, the new VM was seen as not nessasarily
being quite as good in the best cases, but avoiding the worst lockups (of
course it had a few problems of it's own, but these seemed to be easier to
fix without causing additional problems)
