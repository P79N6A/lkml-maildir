In this case it's an optional library kernel module.  That seems to be a 
common setup for library modules.  We do the same with CONFIG_MII and 
drivers/net/mii.ko as well.
Originally it was done purely in the Makefile, but that does not account 
for net drivers in sub-directories (or out of tree as you point out).
