could you take an approach similar to git, store the length and a hash of 
the first X amount of the file (for good performance say the first block, 
for best security say the entire file)? is there a hash that's cheap 
enough to calculate that this is reasonable? (although it would end up 
trashing the cpu cache in any case, loosing a bunch of the benifits of 
DMA)
