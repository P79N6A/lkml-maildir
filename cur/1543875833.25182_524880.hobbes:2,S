I wrote a few udev rules to create specific /dev nodes for X with evedv 
(I run with multiple X users / screens / keyboards / mice on one 
machine).  I can forward you the udev rules and helper scripts if you 
want.  This means that you can hardcode the /dev nodes in your xorg.conf 
file and udev will make sure they don't move on you.  I wrote this up in 
the early days of evdev development before the phys stuff was there.
