Vojtech,
I've tried out your new via driver and it
appears to have solved the problem with
the mis-detected ls-120 drive, but the ata66
drives are still being run at 33. 
More interestingly, the pci-clk calculations
seem to be returning badly off values.
My motherboard is a kt133a+686b btk7a from abit.
When I set the FSB to 133 with PCI=133/4=33 the
timing code returns 43mhz.
when I set the FSB to 100 with PCI=100/3=33 then
it returns 42mhz.
These are scarely different from the nominal values.
I didn't observe anything bad in the few minutes
I was running like this, but right now I've hacked
the driver back to a hardcoded 33.
What should I do next?
