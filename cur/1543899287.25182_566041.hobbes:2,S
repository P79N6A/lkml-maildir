    That's the problem: I want to use "ondemand" but I don't know if it
will work properly with my CPU because I don't know if my CPU switches
frequency fast or slow :( I can find that information, although the
Kconfig file for cpufreq says that AMD64 has latency problems (but I can
confirm that, I'm afraid).
    Thanks for your answer :)
