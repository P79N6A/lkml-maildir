The affected architectures have only recently changed in this regard.
ppc64 was the most notable case, where it had a barrier for MMIO
(eieio) but not a general memory barrier. PA-RISC likewise formerly had
no such barrier and was a more normal case, with no barrier whatsoever.
Both have since been altered, ppc64 acquiring a heavyweight sync
(arch nomenclature), and PA-RISC acquiring 2 memory barriers.
