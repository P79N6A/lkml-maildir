Hi there,
Yes, this is a known bug with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.  If you have
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS turned on, and you build a kernel, and then you change
certain options such as CONFIG_SMP, you will get stale *.ver files and
your build will blow up.
Workaround:
    copy your /usr/src/linux/.config file somewhere
    make mrproper (or remove your whole tree and re-install it)
    put your /usr/src/linux/.config file back
    make oldconfig
    make dep
    make clean
    make bzImage
    make modules
    make modules_install (if you want)
Hope this helps,
Michael Elizabeth Chastain
