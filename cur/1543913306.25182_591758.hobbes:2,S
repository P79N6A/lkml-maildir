The only -22 error path in pci_set_power_state is this:
	/* Validate current state:
	 * Can enter D0 from any state, but if we can only go deeper 
	 * to sleep if we're already in a low power state
	 */
	if (state != PCI_D0 && dev->current_state > state) {
		printk(KERN_ERR "%s(): %s: state=%d, current state=%d\n",
			__FUNCTION__, pci_name(dev), state, dev->current_state);
		return -EINVAL;
	} [...else...]
(There seems to be one "if" too many in the comment.)
dev->current_state was PCI_UNKNOWN, and this is not properly handled by
pci_set_power_state.  Some checks later, there is
	switch (dev->current_state) {
	case PCI_D0:
	case PCI_D1:
	case PCI_D2:
		pmcsr &= ~PCI_PM_CTRL_STATE_MASK;
		pmcsr |= state;
		break;
	case PCI_UNKNOWN: /* Boot-up */
		if ((pmcsr & PCI_PM_CTRL_STATE_MASK) == PCI_D3hot
		 && !(pmcsr & PCI_PM_CTRL_NO_SOFT_RESET))
			need_restore = 1;
		/* Fall-through: force to D0 */
	default:
		pmcsr = 0;
		break;
	}
But the PCI_UNKNOWN branch will never be reached because of the if ()
clause quoted above.
Also, this FireWire controller here surely had left the boot-up phase
already long ago when the reporter tried to suspend the machine.
