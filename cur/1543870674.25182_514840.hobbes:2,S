setup_rt_frame() is obviously wrong? Surely it must check ->hasvdso like
setup_frame() does! Otherwise, we will have SIGSEGV on SA_SIGINFO if
->load_binary() does not call arch_setup_additional_pages(), no?
If no, what ->hasvdso is?

It is needed for sysexit. If we don't use sysenter (and we shouldn't, because
syscall_page is not mapped), we don't need to initialize it. Note also that
sys_execve() sets TIF_IRET, so we are safe even if sys_execve() was called
using __kernel_vsyscall.
Still, I don't understand why we don't pass NEW_AUX_ENT(AT_SYSINFO) when
vdso_enabled == 0. We don't need linux-gate.so to use __kernel_vsyscall,
we have FIX_VDSO. In that case we should s/PAGE_KERNEL_RO/PAGE_READONLY/
of course. I guess the reason is some magic in glibc.
