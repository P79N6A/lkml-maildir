I'm confused, and I think something else must be going on... to have 2
different drives, with two completely different ASICs in them (and
therefore significantly different object code), have identical
corruption of the same 6 bytes of their configuration block is just
not likely.  I'm pretty sure they don't even have the same utility
zone layout.
Is that how the drive IDs when connected via other controllers, in
another system, etc?
hrm...
