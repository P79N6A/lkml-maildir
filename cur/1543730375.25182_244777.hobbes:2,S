Thanks a lot for the response.
Will u be able to provide me a link that will be able to help in making
this PAGE-OFFSET and related issues more clear.
Also, it seems to be whats going on here is high-end expertise level
stuff.
I am new to Driver Writing even though I was working on linux before
this. So, will u be able to suggest me a list where in I can post my
basic issues about Memory management issues, Time Control issues and
Driver Control, so on.
Or else is it ok if I post them here.
Thanks for that again.
Regards,
Mukund jampala

No.  PAGE_OFFSET is the virtual address at which physical address
0 is mapped into an arch/i386 kernel.

No.  0-PAGE_OFFSET is the virtual address space provided to user space.
So it has an arbitrary mapping to virtual memory.
