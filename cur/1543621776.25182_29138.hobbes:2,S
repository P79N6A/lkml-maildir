Since bk doesn't seem to let me remove the thing from the
history (probably with some good reason), I guess you
might as well import the following patch:
http://surriel.com/patches/2.5/2.5.5-p2-struct_page5
As a side effect, this patch should reduce the whole
thing to one changeset, which isn't all bad since we
don't need to have the history of Linux cluttered up
with all the minor changes to this patch ;)
regards,
Rik
