The extreme solution would be
config X86_POWERNOW_K8
        tristate "AMD Opteron/Athlon64 PowerNow!"
        select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
        depends ACPI_PROCESSOR
A medium solution might be
config X86_POWERNOW_K8
        tristate "AMD Opteron/Athlon64 PowerNow!"
        select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	depends (ACPI_PROCESSOR || ACPI_PROCESSOR=n)
But in the end, the best solution depends on how many percent of the 
X86_POWERNOW_K8 users have Christian's problem of requiring 
ACPI_PROCESSOR. If there are only very few people with this problem, I'd 
say leave it as it is.
