Subject: Documentation about input events - Was [Re: Trouble with lineak and 2.6 kernel]

Because I think there will be no simple solutions using the atkbd driver I was 
thinking about trying to write an auxiliary driver that uses input events to 
send them to userspace (and then try to write a daemon to make them work).
The only problem is... that I don't know where to start.
Can anyone tell me where to find doc about input events? Thanks.
