Take 1.01
A minor revision of the perl-programm. Now it ignores empty lines,
removes comments and leading/trailing whitespaces.
In debug-mode it now prints what words where missspelled (3x"s"?)
The spell-file (default "spell_fix.txt") is now searched also in the
directory from where spell_fix.pl was started.
And the list contributed by shaheed
(minus "everytime=everytime" and "Auxillary=Auxillary")
With this list a run over 2.5.63 found 2866 spelling-errors. (counting the
+ lines in the diff.) The diff is 18690 lines long (846689 bytes)

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated,
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
