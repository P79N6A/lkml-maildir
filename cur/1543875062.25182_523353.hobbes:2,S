btw that is something extremely evil to do. Either you have varying apis
between kernels (which is naughty, but I suppose you can go up in
capabilities) or it's fully static. 
If it's dynamic, doing it compiletime is BAD. The same binaries should
run on multiple kernels after all. An ioctl or a sysfs thing or
something is a lot better than a compile time constant.
If it's entirely static exposing a "version" doesn't mean anything and
it might as well be killed...
