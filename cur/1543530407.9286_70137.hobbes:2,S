No. Typically, one process has blown up for whatever reason (Netscape
seems quite keen on doing this, for example) and swallowed all the RAM it
can get. Killing this process will solve the problem.
Panicking the system is certainly not the right response - better to kill
a handful of processes and keep the system alive.

We just need to make sure the RIGHT process(es) go down, not just the
"polite" ones which bother checking the memory they are given.

Having looked more closely at the code, it looks as if it does overcommit
to a limited extent, usually. This isn't the problem here, though - the
problem is an app with a memory leak. Nothing to do with overcommit, COW
etc. - just too much memory being used.
