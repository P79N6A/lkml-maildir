Subject: [2.5] double free in ext2?

Hello!
   I am playing with smatch and while testing my improved version of
   unfree.pl, I seems to have found a double free condition in ext2:
   fs/ext2/super.c::ext2_fill_super()  (I am looking at yesterday's 2.5 snapshot)
   in line 784 we do kfree(sbi->s_group_desc); (then print "EXT2-fs: unable to read group descriptors\n")
   and go to failed_mount_group_desc, which reads (from line 821):
failed_mount_group_desc:
        kfree(sbi->s_group_desc);
   2.4 is not affected.
Bye,
    Oleg
