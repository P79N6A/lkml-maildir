    Seconded: as a user of (various) distributions, I've come across
the following
  problem: sometimes the initramfs, for whatever reason, does not manage to
  find or mount the rootfs. In those cases I hate the developpers of
the distribution
  because there is basically nothing that can be done in the initramfs
to see, test,
  try, mount, modprobe, umount, ping, telnet, etc... Please, please, throw in a
  full-featured busybox. Here is a good compromise I use:
Currently defined functions:
        [, [[, arp, arping, ash, awk, basename, brctl, bunzip2, bzcat,
        bzip2, cat, chgrp, chmod, chown, chroot, chvt, clear, cmp, comm,
        cp, cpio, cut, date, dc, dd, deallocvt, depmod, df, diff, dirname,
        dmesg, dos2unix, dpkg, dpkg-deb, du, dumpkmap, echo, egrep, eject,
        env, expr, false, fbset, fdflush, fdformat, fdisk, fgrep, find,
        findfs, ftpget, ftpput, grep, gunzip, gzip, halt, head, hexdump,
        hostname, hwclock, ifconfig, ifenslave, insmod, ip, ipcalc, kbd_mode,
        kill, killall, killall5, less, linux32, linux64, ln, loadfont,
        loadkmap, losetup, ls, lsmod, md5sum, microcom, mkdir, mkfifo,
        mknod, mkswap, mktemp, more, mount, mv, nice, od, openvt, patch,
        pgrep, pidof, ping, ping6, pivot_root, pkill, poweroff, printf,
        ps, pwd, readlink, reboot, reset, rm, rmdir, rmmod, route, rpm2cpio,
        rtcwake, sed, setarch, setkeycodes, sh, sha1sum, sleep, sort,
        stat, strings, stty, su, swapoff, swapon, switch_root, sync, tac,
        tail, tar, tee, telnet, test, touch, tr, traceroute, true, tty,
        udhcpc, umount, uname, uniq, unix2dos, unzip, vi, wc, wget, which,
        xargs, yes, zcat
  (linux32 and linux64 are probably not useful for general initramfs). With that
  configuration, busybox (v1.13.0.svn, x86-32 executable) is 416224 bytes long
  (dynamically linked with libc as only library needed).
