I'm running 2.4.21 on this particular machine, and know it worked under
2.4.20.
  Bus  0, device  31, function  1:
    IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82801DB ICH4 IDE (rev 1).
      IRQ 10.
      I/O at 0xf000 [0xf00f].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x20000000 [0x200003ff].
mike:~# hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  3 (32-bit w/sync)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
mike:~# hdparm -Tt /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.37 seconds =345.95 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.88 seconds = 34.04 MB/sec
ASUS P4B533 here, and other similar machines work as well.
