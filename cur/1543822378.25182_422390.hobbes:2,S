Allow me to jump in if I may:  The number of TLB misses did not change that
much (both i-side and d-side and is expected).  What changed is the penalty
of TLB misses are reduced: i.e., number of page table walk performed by the
hardware are reduced. This is due to specialized buffering of information
that reduces the need to perform page walks. With page table sharing, the
overall size of page tables are reduced, in turn, it has a better hit rate
on the buffered items and it helps to mitigate page walks upon a TLB miss.
