We would need two fields in the policy structure
1. The specified nodemask (generally ignored)
2. The effective nodemask (specified & cpuset_mems_allowed)
If we have these two then its easy to get a bit further by making
the first nodemask a relative nodemask. The calculation of the effective
nodemask changes somewhat but the logic is then applicable to MPOL_BIND as 
well.
