I have some questions here for the community.  I am considering a complex
sniffer with token ring, and at least two ethernet nics.  A third nic
would provide access to the company lan {inquiry and control}. We need 
to measure timing between messages traversing various platforms and try
to relate them for verification of performance models.  I would prefer
one platform with several nics as the timebase would be common.  Accuracy
in the milli-second range is fine.  The machine would do nothing but
collect the messages.
The questions:
1) Will this performance problem impact timing measurement or cause loss
   of data when more than two nics are being measured.
2) Would a multi-processor motherboard help?
3) Should I vary the model/brand of nics used so that I avoid problems
   relating to common registers and interrupts?  {Suggestions}
4) Would Real-Time linux be a better solution or just buy more problems?
Comments are appreciated.
