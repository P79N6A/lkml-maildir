I believe 2.4 and 2.5 (mis)behaviour is now the same.
( what I can't understand is how the acpi team hopes to get acpi
included in mainstream distributions without getting it to work with
such a big chipset provider as VIA. They should realize it's a
showstopper - no vendor will release a product that fails on such a big
class of hardware ).
