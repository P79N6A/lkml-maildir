Unfortunately, in libata all it means at this point is
(a) the error occurred on a read command, and
(b) we did not attempt to retry the command
So, a generic non-specific error you see on all errors.
libata does not (yet) retry cable errors, for example.  Paul, don't 
automatically assume the disk is bad, try swapping cables.
