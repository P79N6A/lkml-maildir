Hey all,
I've been having quite a time with the e1000 driver running at gigabit 
speeds.  Running it at 100Fdx has never been a problem, which I've done 
done for a long time. Last week I picked up a gigabit switch, and that's 
when the trouble began.  I find that transferring large amounts of data 
using scp invariably ends up with sshd spitting out "Disconnecting: 
Corrupted MAC on input."  After deciding I must have purchased a bum 
switch, I grabbed another model.. only to get the same error.
Finally, I used a crossover cable between the two boxes, which resulted 
in the same error from sshd again.
Both systems are 2.6.10, with 4k stacks, and regparm enabled. system 1 
has an onboard Intel 82547EI, system 2 has an onboard Intel 82545EM, 
both have NAPI enabled... Oddly, running the nics at 100Fdx does not 
generate this error no matter how much pressure I put on them. I've 
found a lot of scuttlebutt regarding these problems with sshd on the 
net, but this appears a hardware/driver problem.  There's mention of a 
specific problem with e1000 here:

  but no apparent resolution.
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
