  I find it interesting that many people have this problem with Netscape.
I've been running 4.51 for around 4 months (under 2.0.x) and never had it
hang or die.  With previous releases of Netscape there was some
instability, but usually I just upgrade my libc and it settled down.
When Netscape was developed (as with most products) a certain environment
was used, ie: certain level of the kernel, libc, binutils, etc.  Perhaps
Netscape should published the exact environment the product was built and
tested under as a way for people to figure out how their environment
differs. 
  Making a blanket statement that 'product XYZ will work with a 2.0
kernel' will almost always be false on someones system.  And usually it's
environmental.
