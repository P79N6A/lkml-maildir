Well, there are uses for the 'dynamic' filter, and it doesn't add too
much complexity. One could be allowing certain commands to be performed
on certain devices by normal users - eg. CD-burning or whatever without
root privileges (I know we're using ide-scsi for the command access
right now ...), and also protecting the oneself from ACPI and the like.
Because ACPI can do IDE commands and does that in a way interfaceable to
a 'taskfile' kernel ioctl. It'd be nice to know a broken ACPI
implementation can't screw up your drive easily through a kernel driver.
