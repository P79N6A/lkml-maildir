i disagree, the early_res stuff is still quite unclean, and what we want 
do do is to get rid of it, not promote it into 32-bit code ... (The 
reason we merged the early_res stuff in 2.6.25 was because it was 
certainly cleaner than the horrible open-coded reservations that the 
64-bit code did before. So now we at least have a more less visible 
enumeration of reservations.)
The correct and clean clean solution is what hpa mentioned: to do 
reservations in the e820 space. I think hpa has some code for that 
already and we should merge that. Peter?
