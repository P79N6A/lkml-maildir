Subject: [PATCH] x_tables: fix alignment on [at least] ppc32 (was Re: 2.6.16-rc1: iptables broken on ppc32?)

Hi,
the patch below fixes the problem on ppc32. Dave: Please apply.
[NETFILTER] x_tables: Fix XT_ALIGN() macro on [at least] ppc32
To keep backwards compatibility with old iptables userspace programs,
the new XT_ALIGN macro always has to return the same value as IPT_ALIGN,
IP6T_ALIGN or ARPT_ALIGN in previous kernels.
However, in those kernels the macro was defined in dependency to the
respective layer3 specifi data structures, which we can no longer do with
x_tables.
The fix is an ugly kludge, but it has been tested to solve the problem. Yet
another reason to move away from the current {ip,ip6,arp,eb}tables like
data structures.
