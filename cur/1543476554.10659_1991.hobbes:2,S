Indeed. Maybe we really should use kswapd for this, especially now that
kswapd doesn't really do much else..
Btw, pre-6 had a bug in kswapd that is relevant to this discussion - it
used a 0 argument to try_to_free_pages(), even though kswapd very much is
able to do IO. (So in pre-6, waking up kswapd is the wrong thing to try to
do ;)
