OK, let me get the neon out then. This has nothing to do with
throttling, I thought I made it clear that I get why you store the
origin queue in ->bi_queue. I'm concerned with the workings of
redirecting a bio. Previously we looked up the queue associated with
bio->bi_bdev inside the loop in __generic_make_request(), as is REQUIRED
to correctly locate a DIFFERENT queue if bio->bi_bdev has been changed
to point somewhere else.
Clear?
