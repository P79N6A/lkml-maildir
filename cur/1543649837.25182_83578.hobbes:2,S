Machine did it again yesterday 7:55 morning, after having ~10 hours
uptime. All three dumps are same, with minor difference in last one:
*pde is 024c4067, and Process line is 'cat (pid: 11497, threadinfo=c3960000,
task=d1c3a780)'... All other values are same.
And during boot I received:
...
Adding 1024120k swap on /dev/hda2.  Priority:-1 extents:1
EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,1)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in
   datazone - block 3245558600, count = 38276
Checking root file system...
fsck 1.30-WIP (30-Sep-2002)
...   
It looks to me very strange that ext2 was freeing blocks while being
mounted read-only...
And I forgot in last mail: kernel is compiled WITHOUT preempt.
                                            Thanks,
