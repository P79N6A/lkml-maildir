I am not sure if this applies in your case, but I was getting problems
such as this on my Abit KT7-RAID and had the correct cables, also.  One
day, on a hunch after reading a post from Alan about overclocking, I
took my Athlon 750 down to 850 from 1.05 GHz and all is working great
now.  If your overclocking, I would suggest not doing so (at least not
so much), based on my experience.  I am also using the v4.0 driver.
