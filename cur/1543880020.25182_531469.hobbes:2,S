What do you mean? By what criteria?

The main problem as I see it is choosing which task to run next and
how much time to run it for. And given that there are typically far less
than 58 (the number of priorities in nicksched) runnable tasks for a
desktop system, I don't find it at all constraining to quantize my "next
runnable" criteria onto that size of key.
Even if you do expect a huge number of runnable tasks, you would hope
for fewer interactive ones toward the higher end of the priority scale.
Handwaving or even detailed design descriptions is simply not the best
way to decide on a new scheduler, is all I'm saying.
