Correct me if I'm wrong, but it appears ACPI 1.0 wants _PTS called 
before any devices are suspended, ACPI 2.0 is contradictory, and ACPI 
3.0 says that you can't assume anything about device state. My guess is 
that unless Windows has different behavior depending on ACPI version, it 
probably has called _PTS before suspending devices all along. Therefore 
it would likely be safest to emulate that behavior, no?
