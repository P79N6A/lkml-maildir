Interesting thread on this:
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/bug-glibc/2001-11/msg00079.html
for glibc 2.2.4 with the following program with input file
of 354371 lines of text(/usr/share/doc/*), where the average line
length was 37 chars.
getc/putc
real 
2.181s
user 
2.150s
sys 
0.030s
getc_unlocked/putc_unlocked
real 
0.326s
user 
0.280s
sys 
0.040s
I.E. 669% faster!
