Nor does plugging a keyboard in work either.  On the other hand, for the 
application this computer is destined for, not being able to reboot is 
far, far worse than adding a mouse/keyboard at run time, so I'm happy. 
I'm still willing to work on and test patches, though, as I think it 
would be good to get some form of fix into the kernel.  And the fact 
that 2.4 works shows that it is possible...
