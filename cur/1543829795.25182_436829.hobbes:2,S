I'm often trying to reproduce compile errors, and it's always a pain in 
the ass when I have to construct a complete .config based on such a 
fragment instead of simply using the complete .config of the reporter.
And people for whom a few kB would matter wouldn't subscribe to 
linux-kernel...

It would be a solution to let HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI depend on
(ACPI_DOCK || ACPI_DOCK=n), or the #if in 
include/acpi/acpi_drivers.h could be changed to
#if defined(CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK) || (defined(CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
Which one suits better the intention is better is a question Kristen has 
to answer.
