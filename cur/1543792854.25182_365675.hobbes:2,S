To avoid the overhead of forking it e.g. if it's a large nonlinear vma,
a lot of time may be wasted on copying its ptes for fork.  That's one
of the reasons I came to like your DONTCOPY.
So, it may not be useful for your particular RDMA issue, but I see no
reason to exclude VM_SHARED vmas from the madvise, and good reason to
include them.
