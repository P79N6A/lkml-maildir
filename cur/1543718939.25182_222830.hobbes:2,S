Hello Linus.
It would be interesting we use GNUPG for we sign the messages in the 
list of development of the kernel so that we can guarantee the 
authenticity of the codes and sent messages.
It would be a good form of we have not problems with patents and 
responsibility for the sent codes.
We would make available our public keys in a servant of keys.
