Greetings;
I guess we can forget about parts of my "no audio" whine.  It turns 
out there are alsa options in the "make menuconfig" that somehow are 
not in "make xconfig".  Hint...
I turned on what I thought was the right stuff, and was greeted by the 
drum solo when I started kde just now.  So at least kde can make 
noises now.
However, xawtv and gnomeradio are still mute, gnomeradio complaining 
about not being able to access /dev/radio, and xawtv silently exiting 
after the launch timeout.  Do I need to relink those devices in /dev?  
If so, what to, or to what as the case may be?
Also, FYI, I had to turn the APIC stuff completely off in the .config 
in order to get rid of that "I found it & turned it on" message in 
dmesg.  It was ignoreing, or reporting no such option when noapic or 
pci=noapic was appended to the kernel arguments line in grub.conf.
