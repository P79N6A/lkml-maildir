Udo,
the driver has an issue that is affected by fiddling with different
parameters, it's a timing issue of somesort, changing a bit of code
seems to fix it on one system but it breaks it on others, I am comparing
the driver line by line to the specs to see where the misbehavioure
could be comming from.
