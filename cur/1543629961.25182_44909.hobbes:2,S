Generic plan. I has something in mind when asked, but not this ...
Actually in task_t.comm we have 2 cases
1. strncpy(a, b, sz)
2. snprintf(a, n, blah-blah...)
I thought somebody will beat me for completely eliminating strcpyn and
replacing it with snprintf in ALL CASES which is more expensive.

Abstracting .comm access can result in, finally, replacing comm[16] with,
for example, *comm
Or if we require to do match_comm (netfilter match, connections belong to
process specified by name) job we can patchhook somewhere in set_xxx to
avoid excessive for_each_tasked strcmps.
... more?
