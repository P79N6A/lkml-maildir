The NET_ETHERNET config option is just for Kconfig and does not have an
impact on the resulting kernel.  It does make more semantic sense to
have Pegasus, usbnet, etc use the NET_ETHERNET option as they are
Ethernet devices, not some type of generic network device. 
Additionally, depending on how you configure usbnet, it will require MII
which also depends on NET_ETHERNET, so you would wind up that way
anyway.
