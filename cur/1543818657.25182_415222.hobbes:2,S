I have seen this before posted here... and after I got my head around
it, WOW.  What a good tool (if it works right, building right now ;-) 
)
It took me some sussing to upgrade from 2.6.15.4 -> 2.6.15.7 (I
trashed my 2.6.15.6 tree, so had to start from last full kernel source
I had), but once sorted it is so fast!
Good job :-)
Nick
