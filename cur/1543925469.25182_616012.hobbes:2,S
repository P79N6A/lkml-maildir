So?  Those are very common things and most drivers don't resort to
`volatile' to access them.

checkpatch is quite accurate now - Ingo has been following this quite
carefully.
If you were to use it there would be improvements in the exceptionally high
number of mistakes in your patches.

Bug reports against checkpath should be sent to apw, not used as an excuse
to put incorrectly laid-out code into the kernel and for increasing my
workload.

How did you know I had a Panasonic flat screen? ;)

If it is indeed the case that this architecture is used internally by a
single organisation then perhaps it doesn't make sense for us to merge it.
One of the main reasons we put code into the kernel is as a means of
distribution: to get it into the hands of people who need it.  But in this
situation there is no advantage to *anyone* from this merge apart from MEI.
IOW, the submitter gains and everyone else loses.  It's a curious situation.
I guess if it were possible to install a self-built kernel into a Panasonic
gadget then we could look at it on that basis.  Do you know if that's the
case?
