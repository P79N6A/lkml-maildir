*bzzzzzzt* wrong.
The "standard" (compiler/portability) flags don't use xtaso, so it is 64-bit
clean code.
The "peak" flags use xtaso_short - it's an optimization.
This is in the specbench.org cpu95 results submitted by DEC.  They also
used the magic -32data flag for some programs.
elysium; cat test.c
main() {
  printf("%d %d\n", sizeof(char *), sizeof(long));
}
elysium; cc -xtaso_short -32data test.c -o test
elysium; ./test
4 4
elysium;
BTW: That answers someone else's answer about 32 bit longs.  It's just
undocumented.
David.
