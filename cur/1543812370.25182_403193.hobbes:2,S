Yes, but the point that the ATA limits tend to be on the low side still 
stands.
For example, I think the IDE driver defaults to a maximum transfer of 256 
sectors, and the same number of max scatter-gather entries. Some 
controllers will actually lower that, due to silly hw problems.
The point being that it has worked fine for IDE, and if a SCSI controller 
has noticeably lower limits than that, there's something really strange 
going on, like a real bug.
