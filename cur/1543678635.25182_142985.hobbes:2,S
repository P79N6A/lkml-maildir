Unfortunately, the build continues even when it runs into compile or
link errors.  So if a binary impacts multiple components in the build,
it results in multiple errors.
The root of the nine errors is...
fs/partitions/acorn.c: In function `adfspart_check_EESOX':
fs/partitions/acorn.c:541: `first_sector' undeclared (first use in this
function)
fs/partitions/acorn.c:541: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only
once
fs/partitions/acorn.c:541: for each function it appears in.)
fs/partitions/acorn.c:550: `hd' undeclared (first use in this function)
fs/partitions/acorn.c:551: warning: implicit declaration of function
`add_gd_partition'
fs/partitions/acorn.c:551: `minor' undeclared (first use in this
function)
make[2]: [fs/partitions/acorn.o] Error 1 (ignored)
Sorry for the confusion....but at least it got your attention!  :)
