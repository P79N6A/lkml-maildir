Hello All,
    I have an IDE CD burner and I use the SCSI emulation enabled by
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI to access it.  Since I do not have have any
SCSI hard disks (nor drivers for them) my .confif file does not contain
CONFIG_SD_EXTRA_DEVS, which causes drivers/scsi/sg.c to not compile.
If I add the line:
#define CONFIG_SD_EXTRA_DEVS (0)
to autoconf.h then everything builds.
Thanks,
Jim
