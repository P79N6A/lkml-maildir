The sites you refer to claim XTP operates better than TCP over
unreliable networks because it does selective retransmission whereas TCP
does go-back-N.
This is no longer true of TCP -- TCP has SACKs, implemented in Linux for
a while now, to do limited selective retransmission.
Reliable multicast sounds interesting though.
