Looks good to me. Do you think we need to do something about the DRM
notifier thingy too ? Or just let the code as-is, that is use the
notifier/mask (if any) of the task doing the dequeue_signal() ? I don't
see anybody insane enough to use signalfd read() with the DRM lock held
but who knows ...
Oh and Roland patch doesn't prevent signalfd() from stealing synchronous
signals such as SIGSEGV etc... which I think would result in random
behaviour.... do you want a patch for that or we just consider it broken
API usage and let it as it is ?
Cheers,
Ben.
