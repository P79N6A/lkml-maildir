That's not that much of a problem.
There is me and there are some other people who sometimes go through 
older bugs asking submitters whether the issue is still present in a 
recent kernel.
And if it is not or the submitter doesn't answer the bug gets closed a 
few weeks later.
The problem with this approach is what to do when the bug is still 
present - it's quite unfair to ask a submitter whether a bug is still 
present, but having no way to help the submitter if he confirms it's 
still present.
A positive example is e.g. sparc: davem doesn't use Bugzilla, but when I 
forward bugs to him from Bugzilla I know that there will be an answer.
But for other subsystems like e.g. ext3 I don't know about anyone who 
will answer every time I forward a bug that is still present in the 
latest kernel.

At least one positive thing about Bugzilla is that it shows how bad our 
bug handling is - bug reports noone took care of are visible...

We do already get more bug reports than we can handle.
As an example, until recently people were spreading the fairy tale noone 
would test -rc kernels. So I started a list of reported regressions by 
people who did test the -rc kernels, and this shows that we are even far 
away from handling recent regressions within one or two weeks - and the 
situation with other bugs looks much worse.

The problem is not how to communicate bugs - the problem is who will 
look after the bugs.
As an example, Andrew is already doing a great job in forwarding bugs 
from Bugzilla and linux-kernel to maintainers. It's not that maintainers 
miss bugs because they don't see them.

If only this was the only problem...
