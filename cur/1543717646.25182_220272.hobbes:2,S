Your board is broken in some way. I have one right next to me at this 
very moment and it's been running Linux and occasionally Windows XP 
(only for games, of course) for years without a glitch. I don't remember 
if I ever put my only 3c900 in it, but a couple of my 3c905s certainly 
did and they never show problems.
I also have a KT7A which has been my workstation for 3 years and it 
never had any problems like the ones you're reporting, but that's 
different enough to not count as an example.
