I'm curious why you haven't yet included my process
selection algoritm. I know it can select a blocked
or otherwise unkillable process the way the code is
in right now, but a workaround for that can be made
in about 5 minutes.
The "show me the code" attitude doesn't seem to fit
me now, unfortunately. I'm still busy moving house
and I have to be a good python programmer by tomorrow.
Having never seen much python but with the book in
front of me :)
cheers,
