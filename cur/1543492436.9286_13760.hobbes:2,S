What is the status of these drivers in 2.2.x? Are they no longer
experimental drivers? If they are not experimental, could the
menuconfig/config be amended to reflect this?
At the moment if you need to use Permedia, Matrox or ATI, you have to
enable the incomplete or experimental drivers in the Code Maturity menu. 
This of course, isn't necessary for the VESA framebuffer driver. 
I am currently working on 1.0pre5 of my Framebuffer HOWTO at the moment
and checking little things like this - hence my question. 
Cheers, 
Alex
