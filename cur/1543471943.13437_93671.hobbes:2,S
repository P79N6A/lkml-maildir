Hi,
I want to inform you about a crash that seems to be due to the 2.0.36
kernel. The crashed machine is a server, which was up and running with
2.0.35 for several months without problems. With the 2.0.36 the
machine died without any log-messages 18 hours after boot. Now the machine
is again up for 20 days with 2.0.35 and no problems.
Hardware:
- Board: Tyan S1992 DL (Dual-PII-board with LX chipset)
- Processor: 1 Pentium-II 233
- Memory: 128 MB SDRAM
- SCSI-Adapter: * ICP-Vortex GDT6527RP (64MB Cache, Firmware: 2.20.02)
                * Adaptec 2940UW
- Disks: 6 x IBM DDRS-39130 9GB Ultra-Wide (connected to GDT6527RP)
- Streamer: Tandberg MLR3 (connected to 2940UW)
- CD-ROM: Plextor CD-ROM PX-32TS (connected to 2940UW)
- Graphic card: Elsa Winner 1000 T2D
- Network adapter: 3 x Kingston KNE 100Tx
- USV: Effekta 1000 Online (with ShutUp-Software 1.3.5)

The kernel was not configured as SMP-kernel. It is the same
configuration, that I used for the 2.0.35, with the exception of the 
"Parallel IDE protocol modules" (disabled in 2.0.35).
Sorry, that I cannot give you extensive test reports, but too many people
cannot work when I mess around with the server.
Cheers,
Bernd Rinn
