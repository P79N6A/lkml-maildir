   it does NOT work with any protocol.
   there are two problems:
   wheel:
   turning of the wheel in both direction produces 8, 0, 0 (which seems 
to mean any button down), all other buttons produces 8, 0, 0 on button 
down and x, 0, 0 on button up (x depends on button).
   side button: produces exactly same numbers as middle button (clicking 
the wheel, 12, 0, 0 on button up).
   that's with most protocols, some protocols (ps2pp, bare, genps) 
ignore the wheel completely (as far as I can tell that's OK)

   ok, I'll try that (have nobody to push the mouse buttons right now)

   that's irrelevant, I got the results above without X running (by 
reading /dev/psaux). In case it might shed some light anyway, here's the 
X info: protocol is MouseManPlusPS/2, it worked with kernel 2.4.x. Now 
(with 2.6.5) X reports same results as you see above (using xev I see 
the wheel is no event, side button is button 2, just like wheel click)
