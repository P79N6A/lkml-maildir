ksymoops was meant to be separate from the kernel.  It is separate in
2.3 but Alan Cox did not like the idea of tearing it out of the 2.2
kernels so we settled for a message instead.  The code in kernel 2.2
scripts/ksymoops is way out of date.

ksymoops 2.3.3 works on all kernels from 2.0 onwards.  But if other
code like klogd stamps on the report before it gets to ksymoops, there
is nothing I can do about it.  That is why there is a patch in the
ksymoops directory against klogd, to preserve the data that ksymoops
need.
