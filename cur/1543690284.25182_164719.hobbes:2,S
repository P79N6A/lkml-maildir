For fun do the measurement on a pIV cpu. You'll be surprised.
The microcode "mark dirty" (which is NOT a btsl, it gets done when you do a write
memory access to the page content) result will be in the 2000 to 4000 range I
predict. There are things like SMP synchronisation to do, but also
if the cpu marks a page dirty in the page table, that means the page table
changes which means the pagetable needs to be marked in the
PMD. Which means the PMD changes, which means the PGD needs the PMD marked
dirty. Etc Etc. It's microcode. It'll take several 1000 cycles.

A TLB fault in the normal case is about 7 cycles. But that's for a TLB not
being present. For TLB that IS present being written to means going to
microcode.

if you change a page table, you need to flush the TLB on all other cpus
that have that same page table mapped, like a thread app running
on all cpu's at once with the same pagetables.

why would you need a global lock for copying memory ?
