Firstly, I was unable to apply this patch on 2.4.13...
I'm now running 2.4.14-pre2, still had difficulty applying
the patch, and ended up patching parport_pc.c by hand. (?)
However, loading the parport_pc module, with NO arguments,
like I was doing up till 2.4.10, and it still does not
recognise the port as being in ECP mode:
[root@p450 /root]# modprobe parport_pc
[root@p450 /root]# dmesg -c
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778) [PCSPP,TRISTATE]
parport0: irq 7 detected
parport0: cpp_daisy: aa5500ff(98)
parport0: assign_addrs: aa5500ff(98)
parport0: faking semi-colon
parport0: Printer, Hewlett-Packard HP LaserJet 1100
If I load the module WITH arguments, something I've never
had to do in the past, it works:
[root@p450 /root]# modprobe parport_pc io=0x378 irq=7
[root@p450 /root]# dmesg -c
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778), irq 7, using FIFO [PCSPP,TRISTATE,COMPAT,ECP]
parport0: cpp_daisy: aa5500ff(98)
parport0: assign_addrs: aa5500ff(98)
parport0: faking semi-colon
parport0: Printer, Hewlett-Packard HP LaserJet 1100
I'm still unsure why I NEED to supply arguments
to this module.
Regards.
