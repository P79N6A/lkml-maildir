The in-tree modules all install below kernel/, so I don't see why removing the 
external modules directory (extra or whatever) is necessary for that. It 
might still be that there are other external modules 
below /lib/modules/$KERNELRELEASE, though.

Yes, with more than one set of them, each of which using modules_install.
