Hi Richard.
I had your first patchqueued up for this and will soon take a look
at this update.
At first quick look it looked good and I have only two comments:
1) The variable should be named KBUILD_* to fit the general namespace used
2) The new possibility should be documented in Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt
I will get back when I have given it a closer look.
PS. Please also cc: linux-kbuild@vger.kernel.org if you submit again.
	Sam
