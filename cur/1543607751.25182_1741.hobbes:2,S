well, i dont have a floppy drive, so that test is a little difficult to 
do, but i threw some ram in there that i have used in linux before, and 
i still had the slew of ide error messages.  and this harddrive has 
worked in linux before.  i'm getting more and more convinced its an ide 
controller +linux issue.
plus, i just discovered this:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0109.1/0198.html
which really points to ide controller and linux not fighting nicely 
together, altho the thread doesnt really point towards a solution.
