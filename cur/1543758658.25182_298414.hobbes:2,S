Excellent patch, that help description has been totally inappropriate
since it was first introduced. I'm sure it will do fine on namesys'
website, but not in the kernel.

Speaking of inappropriate components in reiser4:
[jes@tomahawk linux-2.6.11-rc5-mm1]$ grep PG_arch fs/reiser4/*.c
fs/reiser4/page_cache.c:               page_flag_name(page, PG_arch_1),
fs/reiser4/txnmgr.c:                    assert("vs-1448", test_and_clear_bit(PG_arch_1, &node->pg->flags));
fs/reiser4/txnmgr.c:            ON_DEBUG(set_bit(PG_arch_1, &(copy->pg)->flags));
Someone was obviously smoking something illegal, what part of 'arch'
did she/he not understand? I assume we can request this is fixed by
the patch owner asap.
Cheers,
Jes
