Gerd,
  do you have any plans for V4L2 being in 2.6 or not? There is still
sitting patch which allows you to control hue/brightness/saturation/contrast
on matroxfb's TVOut in my tree, waiting for V4L2 API defines. 
Should I send current patch (which defines matroxfb_queryctrl,
matroxfb_ctrl_type, MATROXFB_CID_*... binary compatible with its
video4linux2 counterparts), or should I wait?
  I'd like to have this extension in matroxfb before 2.6, as G450's
and G550's TVOuts differ from piece to piece, and default setting
does not fit for everyone...
