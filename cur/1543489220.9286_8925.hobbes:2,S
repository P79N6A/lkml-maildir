Subject: [PATCH] linux-222.dj2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I was going to wait until the end of the week before releasing an update
to my previous patch, but it seems that such a small patch can create such
/big/ problems, so I've released a new revision on my webpage at :
http://www.comp.glam.ac.uk/students/djones2/computers/kernel/patches/
If you only want some of the features, you can get the individual diffs
from the same location. The diffs are applied against 2.2.2ac7, but will
apply to 2.2.2 vanilla with a search & replace for 'ac' -> 'vanilla'
***********************************************************************
If you are using the previous version of this patch, stop using it NOW!
and upgrade to dj2. There exists a possibility of data loss, as I poked
the wrong bridge in dj1. That'll teach me to code without caffeine :)
***********************************************************************
If the dj2 patch breaks anything, please let me know directly, I sometimes
miss digests..
Regards,
Dave..
