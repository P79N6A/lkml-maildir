I too have this problem. The first time dhcpcd is executed it fails due
to timeout. 
If we execute it again it works fine. Looks like the first packets
sent/received through the interface don't get treated right. 
If I reverse the 2.4.4 patch to 2.4.3 it starts working well again.
Something's up with the realtek driver update I would say.
I'm not on the list so please CC me replys.
Thanks.
