To protect a secret means making at least some attempt to keep it from
becoming general knowledge.  If you can come up with a *practical* way
to give me a piece of *open source* software that contains a trade secret
and still keep it a secret, we'd all (especially the guys at NVidia ;) would
love to know it.
Hint:  I doubt the guys at opensource.org will approve a license that involves
an NDA...
