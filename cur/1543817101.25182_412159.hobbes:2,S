We could even end up making security modules to implement standard unix
security. ie, which processes can send any signal to other processes.
Why hardcode the (!sender.user_id || (sender.user_id == target.user_id)
) rule at all? That rule should be the default rule in a security module
chain.
I just think that doing it this way is the wrong way around, but I guess
I'm hardly qualified to speak on this. Aren't security modules supposed
to be for custom security policy, not standard system semantics ?
