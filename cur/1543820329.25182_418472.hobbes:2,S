Seems like a strawman.  We aren't claiming that SELinux is perfect, and
there is plenty of work ongoing on SELinux usability.  But a
fundamentally unsound mechanism is more dangerous than one that is never
enabled; at least in the latter case, one knows where one stands.  It is
the illusory sense of security that accompanies path-based access
control that is dangerous.  You don't have to be an SELinux advocate to
see the problems with a path-based kernel access control mechanism.

Does it have any hope of stopping an attacker who has designed his
attack with full knowledge of AppArmor's design and implementation (no
security through obscurity)?

The problems with path-based mechanisms are technical in nature, not
just philosophical.
