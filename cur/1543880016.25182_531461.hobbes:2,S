spin_lock_init() is not an atomic operation.
In principle, the issue exists. However, the whole issue is a bit of a grey
area. You might take the viewpoint that upping the refcount needs to be
under lock, which needs to take care of ordering issues in case of krefs.
A new spinlock has the same issue. You need to be careful making them
accessible to other CPUs.
If you take code like:
static int producer()
{
	...
	data = kmalloc(...);
	spin_lock_init(&data->lock);
	data->value = some_value;
	data->next = global_pointer;
	global_pointer = data;
	...
}
	
You have an ordering bug anyway, which you can't fix in spin_lock_init().
