The right way to do it is to just not use O_DIRECT. 
The whole notion of "direct IO" is totally braindamaged. Just say no.
	This is your brain: O
	This is your brain on O_DIRECT: .
	Any questions?
I should have fought back harder. There really is no valid reason for EVER 
using O_DIRECT. You need a buffer whatever IO you do, and it might as well 
be the page cache. There are better ways to control the page cache than 
play games and think that a page cache isn't necessary.
So don't use O_DIRECT. Use things like madvise() and posix_fadvise() 
instead.
