Still no hang here. Just to make sure that I didn't mess the test up,
here's what I did:
Get pristine 2.6.22-rc5 kernel sources.
Put your config in place as .config
Run: make ARCH=i386 CFLAGS_KERNEL="-m32" AFLAGS_KERNEL="-m32"
Install the kernel.
Reboot, pass "nmi_watchdog=2" as kernel parameter.
As your config is for a 64bit kernel, several config items had to be set
manually. In one run, I accepted the default values, in the second run,
I tried to adjust those items to match your 64bit config as good as I
could.
Anything wrong with that?
