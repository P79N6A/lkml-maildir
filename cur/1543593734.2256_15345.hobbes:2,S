I really do not belive that for a CPU or a motherboard +- 1 degree would
make any difference.
If a CPU runs fine at, say, 37 degrees C, I do not belive it will have any
problems running at 38 or 36 degrees. I support the ideea of having very
good sensors for temperature monitoring, but CPU and motherboard
temperature do not depend on the rise of the temperature of 1 degree, but
when the temperature rises 10 or more degrees. I hope you understand what
I want to say.
