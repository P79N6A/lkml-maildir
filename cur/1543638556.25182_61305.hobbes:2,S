In essense, remember page coloring preserves the same bits used
for cache indexing from virtual to physical. If these bits are covered 
by the large page, then ofcourse you will get page coloring for free
otherwise you won't.
Also, page coloring is mainly helpful in low associativity caches.
From my recollection of the literature, for 4-way or higher its not
worth the trouble.
Just to rephrase:  
- Large pages almost always solve your page coloring problem.
- Page coloring never solves your TLB coverage problem.
