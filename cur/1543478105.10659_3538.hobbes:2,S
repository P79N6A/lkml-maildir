Subject: 2.2.0pre alpha UDB/Multia - IDE still has IRQ Problems

After checking further including placing printks everywhere it ends up
getting the unexpected interrupt, but I got by this with a reset.
When the disk is enabled (by loading ide-disk) I get an infinite number
of interrupts, all ending with a drive-not-ready bailing out of the
interrupt handler - but the irq is simply reentered.
Something changed between 2.0 and 2.2 since the earlier version works.
Does anyone have any ideas on how to debug this?
