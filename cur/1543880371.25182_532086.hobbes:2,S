For the record, you actually don't need to track a whole NxN matrix
(or do the implied O(n**3) matrix inversion!) to get to the same
result. You can converge on the same node weightings (ie dynamic
priorities) by applying a damped function at each transition point
(directed wakeup, preemption, fork, exit).
The trouble with any scheme like this is that it needs careful tuning
of the damping factor to converge rapidly and not oscillate and
precise numerical attention to the transition functions so that the sum of
dynamic priorities is conserved.
