For unshared data, a stack  and page tables is should be achievable
even with glibc but I haven't sat down and done the math.  But
last I looked if you took out the debug symbols glibc was only 1M.
If glibc can't do it one of the lightweight embedded c libraries
certainly should be able to.

As I put it together you don't need a parent.  The parent can wait for it
or exit the child doesn't care.  Usual unix semantics here :)
If you are using a pipe to communicate to the outside world that
has to be put someplace, but you can always create a fifo in
the filesystem.  You could have a single parent for all of
the lightweight guests.
Lots of choices on how to put the pieces together.

Except for being a child reaper no.  Having a process that
is the child reaper is interesting mainly because it allows
you to get an accurate struct rusage picture of all of the
children in pspace.
