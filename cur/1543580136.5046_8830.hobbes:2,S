Hello,
I am trying to eject my bootable CD-ROM after the user
is finished using it.  The problem is that something
has locked the CD-ROM and every command I send fails
with a "resource busy" error.
I use a custom init program to mount and chroot to the
CD.  I then start X-windows and my application.  When
the application quits I send SIGTERM signals to
X-windows and the other processes I spawned for them
to shutdown as well.  I then try to unmount and eject
the CD but I am not able to do so.
If I don't start the GUI then I can umount and eject
the CD with no problems.  Nothing is different except
I didn't fork the X process.  But if I start the GUI
and then kill the GUI I can't unmount and eject the
CD.  It's as if X-windows is still using the CD even
though I killed it with the SEGTERM signal.
Is there a way to tell the CD to unmount and eject
regardless of what Linux thinks is the 'proper' thing
to do?  Am I killing the GUI wrong?
Thanks
