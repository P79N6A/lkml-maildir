Ok, I buy that argument, but currently for all of the drivers in the
tree using MSI (all 7), only the tg3 driver does such an optimizaion
(well, the mthca does some other MSI-X stuff too.)  And I'm still saying
that if you want to provide such a functionality, you can.  The function
to see if MSI is being used or not will be present, which drivers can
call if they wish to to do such optimizations.
So, the tg3 driver would need a small tweak, but the other drivers would
get code removed from them...
