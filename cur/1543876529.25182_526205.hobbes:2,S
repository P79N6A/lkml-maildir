    I don't know if a me-too may help you, but I have exactly the same 
    trouble on a whole set of dell servers, all with bmx drivers (suse 10.1
    kernel) and values fetched by an homebrew daemon and collected via rrd.

    almost once a day per machine.

    I can patch my app in order to give you those exact numbers (I'm afraid 
    not to be an rrd expert to extract real past values reported)
    on another side, I cannot really test new drivers on those machine just 
    for those tests.

    exactly the same, just xeons instead of AMD.
