I've got some UltraSparc machines with Qlogic PCI SCSI cards:
$ cat /proc/pci
.....
SCSI storage controller: Q Logic ISP1020 (rev 5).
.....
but it looks like there is no support for them in the Sparc architecture.
Is it hard to port the Intel driver to Sparc? Any hints? Anybody working
on it?
Help welcome :)
