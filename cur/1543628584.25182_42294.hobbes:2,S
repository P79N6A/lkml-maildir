Yes, easily spotted a major problem without even reading the whole
thing.

The entire kernel stack is only 8kB in size.  You have already killed
a bunch of random memory by allocating this much memory on the stack.
You allocated 4*8192 = 32kB on the stack here.

You shouldn't do things like this.  Rather have a makefile which sets
the correct defines.

Another 8kB on the stack here - further random corruption.

More clear to add "O_RDONLY" to filp_open, even though it is still 0.

How about "if (f == NULL)"?

Calling generic_file_read() may work in some cases, but not others.  It
depends on the filesystem.  Use "f->f_op->read" instead.
