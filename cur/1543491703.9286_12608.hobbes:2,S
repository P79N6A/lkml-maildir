Groan, more Makefile flakiness.  :-/
The problem is that scripts/lxdialog/Makefile doesn't want to stand
alone: it wants to be invoked from the kernel top-level Makefile,
which does invoke HOSTCC.
The workaround is to just do 'make clean' in scripts/lxdialog and
then do 'make menuconfig' as normal.  Forget the 'make all' part.
'make HOSTCC=gcc' ought to do the job, too.
