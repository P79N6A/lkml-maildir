I don't think the semantics actually matter too much. That would be mostly
down to timing. Surely its sufficient to say something like "when
tasklet_kill returns the tasklet will not be scheduled or execute further"
Do we care if it ran ? And do we want to imply any locking properties we
might have to maintain?
