Hello, i'm translating some Kconfig files to french for the kernelFR
project (
http://kernelfr.traduc.org
), and while i was reading
drivers/net/hamradio/Kconfig
The kernel is 2.6.10
In section : "Baycom ser12 halfduplex driver for AX.25" 9th section, in
the 3rdline, there is :
"The driver supports the ser12 design in full-duplex mode." instead of
"half-duplex mode."
