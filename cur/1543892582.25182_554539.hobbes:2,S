I can't think of anything in there at present which would cause that to
happen, and it's not immediately obvious how we _could_ make it happen - we
have an inode which potentially has no dirty pages and which is itself
clean.  The truncate can span multiple journal commits, so forcing a
journal commit in sync() won't necessarily block behind the truncate.
I guess we could ask sync to speculatively take and release every inode's
i_mutex or something.  But even that would involve quite some hoop-jumping
due to those infuriating spinlock-protected list_heads on the superblock.
hmm.
