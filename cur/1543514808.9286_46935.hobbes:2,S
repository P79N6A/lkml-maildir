Yes, you are right. I checked myself a little more and your approach
is faster and more simple.

SEMMNI is way to small for big applications. Many databases (e.g. IBM
DB/2) use semaphores to administer clients. So you run out of
semaphores if you connect many clients to the databases
As I said I am working on making SEMMNI, SEMMSL and SEMMNS
sysctlable. This leads to allocating the array via kmalloc and also
possibly having a really big array.
