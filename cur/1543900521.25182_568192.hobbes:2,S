To do inter-guest (ie. inter-process) I/O you really have to make sure
the other side doesn't go away.

It's not a double copy: it's a map & copy.
If KVM develops inter-guest I/O then this could all be extracted into a
helper function and made more efficient.

Surprisingly, you have a point here.  Since the key purpose of lguest is
as demonstration code, it meticulously match kernel style.
I shall immediately prepare a patch to convert the rest of the kernel to
the correct "&& at beginning of line" style.
