Hi.
I don't know, if this was posted some time ago, because I was unsubscribed
for a time.
I unpacked a vanilla 2.5.66, copied the .config of my already configured
2.5.64 to the new kernel, made a make menuconfig and immediately canceled
it, without saving.
I got this error-message:
# bla ...
  gcc  -o scripts/lxdialog/lxdialog scripts/lxdialog/checklist.o scripts/lxdialog/menubox.o scripts/lxdialog/textbox.o scripts/lxdialog/yesno.o scripts/lxdialog/inputbox.o scripts/lxdialog/util.o scripts/lxdialog/lxdialog.o scripts/lxdialog/msgbox.o -lncurses 
./scripts/kconfig/mconf arch/i386/Kconfig
#
# using defaults found in .config
#
.config:763: trying to assign nonexistent symbol INTEL_RNG
Your kernel configuration changes were NOT saved.
Regards Michael Buesch.
