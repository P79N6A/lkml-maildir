As far as I know, it HAS been worked out, and was worked out very quickly.

README from the db2 dir of the CVS tree glibc:
As a special exception, when Berkeley DB is distributed along with the
GNU C Library, in any program which uses the GNU C Library in accord
with that library's distribution terms, it is also permitted for
Berkeley DB to be loaded dynamically by the GNU C Library to implement
standard ISO/IEC 9945 and Unix interface functionality.
