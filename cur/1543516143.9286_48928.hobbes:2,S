modutils 2.3.6 has a conflict between the real sound module and the
alias of sound to sb.  Loading sound requires that modprobe load sb
which requires sound.o, sound is an alias for sb so modutils tries to
apply the sb options to the sound.o object.
I will give this some thought and see if I can fix it in modutils.  As
a temporary workaround, change sound to sound-alias in modules.conf.
modprobe sound-alias or modprobe char-major-14 (with the new alias)
will work, modprobe sound will not.
