Sure thing. I've split the patches, and I believe that me going through 
them a second time did them good, there are a few tiny changes over the 
first version.
I split the patch in 4 parts (will send as replies to this mail) : 
	1) crypto_free_tfm related changes
	2) kfree related changes
	3) vfree related changes
	4) whitespace changes
The whitespace changes ended up fairly bigger than initially. I expanded 
the cleanup a bit. It's not a perfect, 100% complete cleanup, but it's IMO 
a lot better than the originals.
