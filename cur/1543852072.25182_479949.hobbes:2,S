interesting that there's any savings from dynticks in this workload. 
When the CPU is busy then dynticks generates the usual HZ scheduler 
tick.
could you try the same measurement with a completely idle system too? 
That is where dynticks has its true effects: longer idle intervals. (but 
even on an idle system dynticks might not make a difference unless the 
hardware can utilize the much larger and more predictable idle times 
that dynticks offers.)
