I'm not sure. At 486 days I was pretty sure it did not matter. These
days you might get 10% slowdown on some microbenchmark, or something
like that. I do not think it can slow down common tasks.
My construction of LED lights is extremely flaky, and I'm afraid of
burning printer port. At 486 days ports were expected to survive such
abuse. Not sure if todays EPP/wtf ports can handle that.
