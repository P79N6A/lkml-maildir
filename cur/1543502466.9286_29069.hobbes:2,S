It would be a good idea to remove the prototype of update_vm_cache in
the header file - this function ceased to exist, why is there still a
prototype for it (sorry, no instant patch yet, my 2.3.x kernels are at
home)? Filesystems that currently don't work would issue proper warnings
at compile time.
Better idea: write
FIXME: this filesystem does't work yet!!!
in a non-comment section into each filesystem that doesn't work yet.
