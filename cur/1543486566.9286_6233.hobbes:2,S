    Greetings,
    When trying to compile the following simple program:
    ------------------------------
    ...
    #include <linux/nfs_fs.h>
    ...
    ------------------------------
    ..with gcc 2.7.2.3.f.1 and kernel version 2.2.1, the errors at the end of
    this message were given.
Yes. Includes <linux/foo.h> are for the kernel, not for user space.
