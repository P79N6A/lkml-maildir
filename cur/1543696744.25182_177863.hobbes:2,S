As I've already written no SysRQ comboes do anything.
I'm speaking about the FN-key led on a laptop which is most definitely not 
kernel toggled - there are 3 keyboard LEDS - Caps, Cursor Keys, Numeric 
Keypad - the first is toggled by caps by the kernel, the second two have 
unusual semantics - the kernel is half responsible and the bios is half 
responsible.  [There is no scroll lock LED]  So the single kernel viewed 
numeric lock LED is visible as two LEDS on the laptop - the kernel can 
toggle a single bit (numlock: off/on) and the SMM Bios sets up how this is 
interpreted.  Normally pressing the FN-key causes the SMM Bios to change 
this hardware intrepretation of the keyboard LED wiring causing a LED to 
light up.  This probably wasn't very clear - but it's definetely not 
kernel [it works during bios performed suspend to disk, etc.] :)
