Yes, this is being worked on actively. This will use the 2.5.x initramfs 
infrastructure, and when it's up and going there will be early-userspace tools 
included in the kernel tarball to do the basic things that need doing 
(essentially responding to hotplug events and creating/removing devices nodes as 
needed).

Yes, this is true. Ideally, the early-userspace version and the normal-userspace 
version will be the same tool (possibly compiled differently, but otherwise 
identical). The early-userspace version should not have to create many nodes for 
a "normal" kernel boot, so most of the remaining ones can be created once the 
user's preferred naming policy can be located and used. Really, the 
early-userspace version only needs to create two nodes that I can think of to 
satisfy the "normal" kernel boot process: /dev/console and /dev/root. However, 
both of these need to be created with knowledge of parameters passed on the 
kernel command line (as the kernel does now), so that when the hotplug process 
sees the appropriate device "appear" it can create the proper device node.
