Well, ALSA 1.0.10-final was already released in last November,
i.e. before 2.6.15.  When 2.6.15 was released, we had ALSA 1.0.11rc2.

These drivers are either ones that are pretty experimental or broken, 
or the ones that are not confirmed to work with the latest 2.6
kernel.  In the latter case, I can push to kernel tree at any time
once after someone tests and reports it to me.
