Maybe what happens here doesn't have anything in common with what you
experienced, but a couple of days ago I suffered a full X server crash due
to a _big_ memory leak with Mozilla in one specific web page.
Linux kernel 2.4.12, Mozilla 0.9.5, and X 4.1.0. Open
www.securityfocus.org with Mozilla. For a couple of minutes, it seems that
all is going on nicely. Afterwards, and without any kind of user
interaction with Mozilla, both mozilla and X processes start increasing
their sizes, slowly, but steadily.
After some minutes of memory "leaking", either Mozilla crashes itself (no
OOM as far as /var/log/kern.log says), leaving X process with a big SIZE
(the same it had just before Mozilla crashed), or the whole X session
crahses.
Bug number 101461 on bugzilla.mozilla.org describes this problem with
Mozilla and www.securityfocus.org. Maybe this behaviour can be triggered
from some other web sites, and maybe it doesn't have anything in common
with your problems, but maybe it is worth a try.
