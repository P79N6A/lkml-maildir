Hello Michal,
do you possibly have new information for me?
But first thank you for the interesting document for which you sent me the URL!
Harddisk check ("badblocks") did not find any errors. 
There also runs smartd all the time and doesn't see any curious S.M.A.R.T. messages on both harddisks (it's a RAID1). 
For an extended memory test I need to take some time in a weekend or night, therefor I can't give information about any results.
Temperature und Voltages are OK.
Would it make sense to try out the finalized (or current, respectively) version of the current kernel?
Bye
Stefan

Please send this photo and config file.
> Remarks: It's a new system - I'm unsure if possibly unreliable hardware also can cause Oopses or if Ooopses everytime are caused by errors in the kernel itself. If it's caused by the hardware - is there a chance to get a hint by the oops pointing to the components causing the errors?
There are some hints about hardware testing in chapter 6
