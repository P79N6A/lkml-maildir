Hello
Finally back to my computer that contains all the info.
In fact, I just gave a quick look to other Intel chipset specs, and I found out 
that the 830, 840, 845, 850, and of course my beloved 820 chipset have a 8 bits 
APSIZE register ! I think this may be the time to write two 'generic' fetch_size
functions : one for the 8 bits register and one for the 16 bits 
register... unless no intel chipset using the generic 'fetch_size' have 
16 bits APSIZE registers, in which case we could replace it...
I'll try to see what I can do, and I will send an update for my patch.
Nicolas.
