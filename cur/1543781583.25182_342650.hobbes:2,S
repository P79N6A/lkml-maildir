Darn. I suspected as much. I'll guess the erase function will have to be
scrapped for now...
Whilst we're on the subject, do the filesystems assume that the device
can tell them exactly where the write failed? I.e. if the driver knows
that 5 sectors were written correctly, but that it failed somewhere
beyond that. It might have failed at sector 6, but it might also have
failed at sector 10. The assumption that sectors contain either old or
new data is still true, we're just unsure which. This can be the case
when you feed a controller a lot of data and it can only report back
success or failure.

A bit too much work for me right now. But I'll be there with my erase
patch when someone implements it. :)
