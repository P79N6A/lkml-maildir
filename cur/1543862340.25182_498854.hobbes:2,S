OK OK OK... Next time I will have coffee *before* replying :-)
Check /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio and dirty_background_ratio. Both are
percentage of total memory. The first one is for "foreground" writes
(ie the writing process may block) while the second one is for
"background" writes :
$ uname -a
Linux hp 2.6.16-rc2-pa1 #1 Fri Feb 3 23:34:56 MST 2006 parisc unknown
$ cat /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio 
40
$ cat /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio 
10
Again, lowering those values should help writing data to disk sooner.
Also you should take a look at min_free_kbytes (although I've not played
with it yet) :
[from Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt] :
  min_free_kbytes:
  This is used to force the Linux VM to keep a minimum number 
  of kilobytes free.  The VM uses this number to compute a pages_min
  value for each lowmem zone in the system.  Each lowmem zone gets 
  a number of reserved free pages based proportionally on its size.
Docuemntation/filesystems/proc.txt is your friend here too.
Regards,
Willy
