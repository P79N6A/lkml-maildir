after you compile it with something like this command line
gcc -c 3c90x.c -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fomit-frame-pointer \
    -fno-strength-reduce -pipe -m486 -malign-loops=2 \
    -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=486 -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__
just copy the generated 3c90x.o to /lib/modules/2.2.16-20/net, overwriting
the old 3c90x.o (made a backup if you wish)
