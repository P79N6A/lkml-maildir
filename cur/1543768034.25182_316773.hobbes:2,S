Wrong.
Put hello.c somewhere in you home directory.
The Makefile shall be placed in same directory.
Restore any files you have overwritten in the kernel dir (like the
Makefile)
Then it will work out.
If not post full details including the output of the make command with
V=1 included: $(MAKE) -C $(KERNELDIR) V=1 M=$(PWD)
