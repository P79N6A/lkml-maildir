On Linux 2.4 the actual limit is 16/32 Terabytes (4K/8K blocksize *
32-bit block-number).  I can support in NWFS 2.4.1 (next release) files
even larger (256TB) however, you are correct that on Linux 2.4 I will be
limited to 16 TB filesizes since we support up to 4K device blocksizes
(could enable 8K though).
