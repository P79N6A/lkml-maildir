No, I haven't exceeded the available vectors, but wli has on a large NUMA-Q 
box.
The x440 and x445's problems are pre-reserving lots of bus numbers in the 
BIOS, more than one per PCI slot.  They must be anticipating PCI cards with 
bridge chips on them.
I believe that the reason for irq_vector being so large is to allow IRQ (and 
eventually vector) sharing.  The array is to map from RTE to vector.
