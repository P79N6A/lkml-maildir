the VP patchset consisted of dozens of latency-breakers, of the 
->break_lock mechanism, of the might_sleep()s (which were placed based 
on latency tracing tools) and on the cond_resched()s too, (and other 
stuff i forget). Most of this is upstream now. To put a cond_resched() 
into might_sleep() is now a 5-liner :-)
