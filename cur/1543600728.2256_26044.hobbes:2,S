damn, I was exciting we had solved everything :)
actually, I am not confident of what could cause these results.  the
2.4.10-pre is going through another set of changes it should not, and
one of them concerns exactly what you are reporting.
SO, I suggest two options: try pre6.  I don't have patches yet, but I
will diff them soon.  pre5 should apply fairly cleanly, anyhow.
Even better, try 2.4.9-ac10.  It is what I use, and there seems to be
less reported problems.  Plus, Alan is not messing with all the VM work
Linus is playing with right now.  Patches for 2.4.9-ac10 are available.
Both can be had at:

I am curious if you see the error again, and what seems to cause it, but
honestly there is too much work being done in 2.4.10-pre to figure
things out.
Nevertheless, I will look into it -- keep me posted.
