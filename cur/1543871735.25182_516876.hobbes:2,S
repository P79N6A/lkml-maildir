ah, looking at the code in e1000 we do:
_suspend:
	pci_save_state();
	free_irq()
_resume:
	pci_restore_state();
	alloc_irq();
I suppose that's not good either, and the major cause of the warning in the 
first place.
Maybe I can rollback your latest patches and try to fix that mess by postponing 
the pci_save_state until after we free'd the irq's.
