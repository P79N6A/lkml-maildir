Erm, this comment could be taken the wrong way.

Mate, where have you been? The day Linus lets user-space dictate what
goes into the kernel is the day hell freezes over. If you want a patch
to go into the kernel, you need to convince him it's a good idea.
Adding a dependency in user-space, expecting it to "force his hand",
will not help. It will probably just piss him off. Or make him laugh.
