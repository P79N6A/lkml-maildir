Agreed. But that didn't stop tg3 from having a 1.5 *SECOND*
spin delay during fiber phy init with interrupts off.
That is certainly a much newer driver than tulip.
(It's not obvious to me by code inspection which context
 tg3_setup_fiber_by_hand() gets called from now.)

It's totally relevant.
Complaints (bug reports) and patches drive change.  That's how both
commercial *and* non-commercial developers prioritize.
"Ingo and the real-time crowd" are a good example of a change
in priorities driven by non-commercial users.

Understood. But they were not the first ones. Donald Becker has a fairly
well known digust for use of CPU spin loops.  But we can't eliminate
*all* udelay just becuase of the way HW is designed and has bugs.
I think it would be reasonable to get rid of many udelay calls
(replace them with PCI read delay loops like Donald has advocated)
and get the rest into a context where it matters less.
I have no objection to people fixing those sorts of issues.

Not true. This patch brings the tulip driver into compliance with
published specs and makes the driver functional for parisc/mips/ia64 users.

The "whatever reason" is clearly decided by the mainline kernel maintainer.
If we treat other people's labor as "free", then the right answer is
to drop the patch and wait for some subset of "we" to do the extra legwork.
Several people care if tulip phy init works right. OTOH, I'm only aware of
one person who specifically cares if tulip is holding the CPU hostage for
1 or 2 ms during the occasional phy init.
Is being a technology purist more important than moving forward with
what people care about?

I think we also agree debugging the problem and providing a patch
that works is a worthy contribution.
We won't lose it. I maintain it in CVS on cvs.parisc-linux.org.
