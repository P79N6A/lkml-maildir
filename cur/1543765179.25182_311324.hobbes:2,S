But that patch will enable the stock kernel.org kernel to work just fine
for that new device, right?  What is wrong with that for all of the
thousands of users of such kernels.  And if you want to provide a driver
that works with different features, there's no problem with that either.
We have numerous drivers in the stock kernel tree that work for the same
device, it's up to the distros to proper configure it in the manner they
so wish.
The patch does not "break" any other driver, they can both co-exist just
fine.
If you do object, please realize that this topic will come up again and
again and again as users try to patch the driver to work with the
device.  Also realize that people can do this dynamically through sysfs
today...
thanks,
