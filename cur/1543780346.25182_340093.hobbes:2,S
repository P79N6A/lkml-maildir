I'm currently writing a driver to diagnose/monitor the error, such as 
core dump.
I inserted some hook in kernel, and when segfault occurs, control is 
transfered to my driver to analyze.
If the cause is in some insmod'ed module, then I would like to get
info of that module. If I get the address of that module, I can get
info such as symbol name defined by that module, etc. Then I could say
in module mmm, at func fff, at addr xxx, there is segfault.
Core dump could be in userspace app, so, in the driver I'm writting now,
I'm using same data structure to hold info of ELF file. If it was in app,
I'm getting address from current->mm->mmap->vm_start.
HK.
