Hmm, this would require that gcc never calculates the location of an
explicitly initialized static variable based on the address of another
one. E.g. in
static int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;
...
    ... a+b+c+d ...
...
egcs-2.91.66 indeed doesn't seem to make this optimization on i386.
(Maybe the pointer increment or pointer offset solution would
actually be slower - didn't check.) But I'm not sure if this is also
true for other versions/architectures, or other code constructs.
