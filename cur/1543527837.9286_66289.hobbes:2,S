Ok, I made a few tests and it seems:
* samba servers use SMB packet "0x85" for keepalive probes. If the
client answers, then the connection remains active. smbfs supports these
probes.
* WinNT servers do not send such packets. They just disconnect after a
few minutes (*), and it expects that the client will establish a new
connection.
smbfs doesn't create a new connection, and the old connection got killed
--> io error!
(*) you can change the timeout with "net Config Server
/autodisconnect:-1" from the NT server. Just search for "autodisconnect
lanmanserver" on google.
