I.e. you would have to unlock before doing fput(). Happens all by itself
if we hold the lock only across the actual method call. I'm not saying
that it's a good way, but correctenss problems are not going to be all
that terrible.

fput() has zero serialization wrt methods. The only case when resetting
->f_op in fput() is safe is when ->f_count hits zero. Precisely because
there's no references left. But at that point you don't need to bother at
all.
