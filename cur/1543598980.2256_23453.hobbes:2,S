Just a small warning:  If anyone writes something like
    int len = min(user_request_len, sizeof(buffer));
    if (user_request_len > len)
        goto fail;
    memcpy(dst, user_src, len);
they can get into trouble even with your min() macro.
Ok, maybe this is crazy code that noone in their right
mind would ever write.
This is not intended as a criticism -- your approach may be
sufficient for existing code -- but it is something to watch
out for.
