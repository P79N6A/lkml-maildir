Not only do I think that CONFIG_xxx_DERIVED needlessly extends the name
of derived vars, but your patch does not belong in a stable series. 
Derived CONFIG_xxx vars are likely to be referenced in source.  Changing
those vars in the middle of a stable series pointlessly breaks external
source code.
I hope vendors don't start applying this patch...
