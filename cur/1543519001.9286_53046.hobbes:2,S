Maybe I'm missing something here... but look at this.  I did the same
thing Riley did, but piped the output to od
x|od -tu1 -w8
which makes a pretty little dump in decimal characters, like so:
0000000  91 201  93  10  91 187  93  10
0000010  91 200  93  10  91 188  93  10
0000020  91 204  93  10  91 185  93  10
0000030  91 186  93  10  91 205  93  10
0000040  91  30  93  10  91  31  93  10
0000050
These DO have the high bit enabled, as 201 is clearly greater than 127.
What I saw from bash was not lines, however...  it was exactly what Riley
described.
As far as I can tell, nothing is stripping your high bit.  Your loaded
font just isn't what you are expecting.  Depending on your distribution
and how it's configured, your're likely to find iso-8859-1 (latin1)
characters instead of lines.  This is, of course, changeable.
