The aic7xxx error handling is still very unreconstructed and DV takes
the driver through this if there's a mismatch.  My best guess is that
like Gr\'egoir's CD-ROM, your wangtek is claiming to support a speed it
cannot.  We find this out in DV, but not until we've gone through all
the error paths.  The quick fix is simply to set the bios to whatever
the tape eventually configures with (although you'll need the current
patch set to make that work properly).
