| And please get rid of the UDF_I_* macro for everything you touch, just
| put a
| 
| 	struct udf_inode_info *uip = UDF_I(inode);
| 
| at the beginning of the function and use the fields directly.
| 
Christoph, I think there should be a separated patch to remove
UDF_I_* macro. I'll make it ;) 
Andrew, may be I should produce a series of patch:
	- 1st to check the memory
	- 2nd to get rid of UDF_I_* macro
?
