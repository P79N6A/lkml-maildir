I read that as Andi is having general stability problems rather than 
specific large memory ones.
I've been running x86 pretty stably on my 2G 32-PAE machine.  I had 
problems a few days ago with X crashing on startup, but I attributed 
that to the 387 problem (it went away after an x86.git update).
