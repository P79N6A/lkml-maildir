   this patch lets one build clip as a module.
This doesn't work and is quite racey.
   +			if (!atm_clip_ops || !try_module_get(atm_clip_ops->owner)) {
Q: What prevents atm_clip_ops from going NULL between the
   !atm_clip_ops test and the atm_clip_ops->owner dereference?
A: Nothing.
Therefore you have to protect these things some how, I would
suggest using a semaphore, put it right next to atm_clip_ops
and hold it around register, derferegister, and code sequence
like this one trying to get a reference to it.
The various ioctl hooks in net/socket.c are good models to
work from.
MPOA/LEC/MPC probably have nearly identical bugs and it would
be great if you could fix them up too.
