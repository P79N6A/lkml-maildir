i take it from that comment that you've never had to write overlays :-)
been there, done that, have the tee...
well actually i don't have the tee-shirt.
anyone know where i can buy a "i used overlays in RSX-11/M" tee-shirt
is a tee-shirt one where if you pour data in one arm; it comes out the other arm
AND the bottom (or is it the neck? i forget!)
