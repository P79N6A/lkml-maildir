Yes sure.

Good.
Here is the patch against 2.6.20-rc6-mm2. CPU_DOWN_PREPARE and
CPU_DOWN_FAILED somehow vanished in mm?
Shutdown cache_reaper when cpu goes down
Shutdown the cache_reaper in slab.c if the cpu is brought down
and set the cache_reap.func to NULL. Otherwise hotplug shuts
down the reaper for good.
