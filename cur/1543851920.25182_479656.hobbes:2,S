No, rt_mutex is fine (I think).
My changelog was very unclean and confusing, I'll try again. What we are
doing is:
	rt_mutex_slowlock:
		task->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
		mb();
		if (CONDITION)
			return -ETIMEDOUT;
		schedule();
This is common and correct.
	hrtimer_wakeup:
		CONDITION = 1;			// [1]
		spin_lock(rq->lock);
		task->state = TASK_RUNNING;	// [2]
This needs 'wmb()' between [1] and [2] unless spin_lock() garantees memory
ordering. Of course, rt_mutex can take rq->lock to solve this, but I don't
think it would be right.
