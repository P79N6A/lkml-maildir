Hi Witold,
Thanks for your patch.  I'm glad somebody is paying attention to
PNP and power.  I CC'd Adam and Rafael because they care about this
area, too, but might not read everything on linux-acpi.

Do you know of anything that specifies the order of the _CRS/_PS0
and the _PS3/_DIS evaluation?  I don't know much about power
management, and I couldn't find anything obvious in the spec.
It seems plausible that we should run _CRS before turning on
the power, but I really don't know.

Is pnpacpi_set_resources() the only place that needs this change?
For active devices, we normally don't call pnpacpi_set_resources()
at all.  So I suppose on these ThinkPads, we exercise this path
because the serial ports are initially disabled?

I don't really like testing acpi_bus_power_manageable() first.
I think we should just call acpi_bus_set_power() and let *it*
bail out if the device doesn't support it.

Can you leave the "unregister_gsi" comment there, since it's not
related to your patch?  It's a reminder that we need to think about
how to handle interrupts when enabling/disabling devices.
