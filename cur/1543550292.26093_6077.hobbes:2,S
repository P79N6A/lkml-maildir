   This is going to be a continuing problem for non-Unix file systems like
   NTFS and NWFS that rely on the ability to read and write variable length
   sector runs.  
It's not just non-Unix file systems.  I believe that xfs will find this
useful as well.   It's just a timing issue, though, making a change like
this is going to have to be a 2.5 thing (along with removing the 2TB
limitation, and other cleanups in the buffer cache code that has been
long overdue).
