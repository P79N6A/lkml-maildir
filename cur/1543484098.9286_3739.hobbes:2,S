Could someone please point me to the current modutils maintainer(s)? I
have couple of interesting patches that I would like to have integrated.
They've already been tested for a while in the Debian modutils-package,
so there should be no problems :).
Wichert.
BTW: Please Cc me on any replies, I don't read linux-kernel very often.
