Just because the omap does it that way, doesn't mean it can't be done
better ;-). I've also just realised the above doesn't account for akita
or borzoi. Since the hardware is identical in this area, the same
changes should be applied for those machines. If we use the platform
device/data approach, we don't have this problem as they all use the
same platform device :)
I can't create a patch at the moment but I can have a look at this
later...
Cheers,
Richard
