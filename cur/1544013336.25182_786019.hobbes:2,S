If they are such a big win then likely they will help other users
too and should be generic in some form.

It's fine for an out of tree variant, but the in tree version
shouldn't have compat.h. For out of tree you just apply a patch
that adds the includes. e.g.compat-wireless and lots of other
projects do it this way.

Ok. Didn't see that.
It still needs to be carefully audited for security holes 
even with root checks.
Another thing is that once auto mounting is enabled each usb stick
with btrfs on it could be a root hole if you have buffer overflows
somewhere triggerable by disk data. I guess that would need some
checking too.

But right now that's not there so it should be root only.

When it's in mainline I suspect people will start using it for that.
