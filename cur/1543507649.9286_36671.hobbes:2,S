   Writing functions returning pointers to static data is just a subscription
for the magic bug of the week contest.  I don't want to have to take care
of "you cannot print two slot names in one printk" type things.

   I want to save re-typing and also to unify the format of PCI slot numbers
printed at various places in the kernel.  Also, it saves a bit of space
since the cached string takes only 8 bytes which is certainly less than
what does passing of two extra parameters to a single printk take.
   Also, adding a slot name to struct pci_dev seems to be the simplest
and lowest-overhead solution I see.

   If you see the primary problem in "name" being confusing, I can
simply change it to "slot_name" to make the things clearer.
				Have a nice fortnight
