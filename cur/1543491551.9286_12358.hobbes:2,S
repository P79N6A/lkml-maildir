Hello,
I  have an Adaptec AHA-152x SCSI controller and, I  compiled the
driver and during boot it seems to initialize correctly:
aha152x: processing commandline: ok
aha152x: BIOS test: passed, detected 1 controller(s)
aha152x0: vital data: PORTBASE=0x340, IRQ=9, SCSI ID=7,
reconnect=enabled, parit
y=enabled, synchronous=disabled, delay=100, extended
translation=disabled
aha152x: trying software interrupt, ok.
scsi0 : Adaptec 152x SCSI driver; $Revision: 1.7 $
scsi : 1 host.
  Vendor: SAF       Model: CD-R4012          Rev: 6.0G
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 6, lun 0
scsi : detected 1 SCSI cdrom total.
but When i try to mount /dev/scd0, my SCSI CD-ROM, my box gives me the
message:
scsi: aborting command due to timeout: pid26, scsi0, channel 0, id 6,
lun 0 read (10) 00 00 00 00 01 00
aga152x: abort() SCpnt = 0xc031bc00
QUEUE STATUS:

- and then dies.
- on windows it works okay.. so it cant be a cable problem.
