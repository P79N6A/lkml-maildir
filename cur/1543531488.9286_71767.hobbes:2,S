Ok.

I can mkreiserfs, or mkfs.ext2 to the drive fine, without the patch.  However,
I can't write any appeciable amount of data.  Just using a normal cp will take
the scsi bus offline after a certain amount of time.
I'm willing to help, applying patches and what not, I can even do some kernel
hacking myself.  However, I can't do much right now, because I am swamped with
work.
I have 5 blank media that are useless to me right now.
Does it help anyone figure out the problem, knowing that I can't rip a cd with
my dvd-ram drive?  My ide cd can rip just fine.  I have no problems reading
normal cds in the dvdram drive either.
