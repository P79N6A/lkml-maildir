Hello Athanasius,
A>    You don't mention if you use FrameBuffer or plain text console.  I
A> used FB with a GF2MX400 for a while and encountered this same problem
A> (in various 2.4.17/2.4.18-pre's), so went back to plain text as I spend
A> most of my time in X11 anyway.  All FB gained me was Tux at boot-time
A> *;-).
By default I have FB disabled and I haven't got a reason to enable it.
Other devices: scsi disabled, usb and sound not used.
