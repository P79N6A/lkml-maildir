[hald polling causes cdrecord to go bad on a USB CD drive]
One possible reason is that we're shooting down the device's pagecache by
accident as a result of hald activity.  This shouldn't happen, but still.
Could you please do
`watch -n1 cat /proc/meminfo' and/or `vmstat 1'
then run cdrecord
then wait a bit
then run hald, see if the amount of pagecache (/proc/meminfo:Buffers or
/proc/meminfo:Cached) suddenly decreases.
If the answer is "no" then I guess there's some unpleasant interaction
happening at the USB level
