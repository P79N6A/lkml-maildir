Subject: 2.4.28 config prompts for EXPERIMENTAL features when shouldn't

I have a basic kernel config that I use for boot disks that has
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL set to no.  Yet, with using my old 2.4.26 config with
2.4.28, I'm getting prompted for new experimental features:
  NVIDIA SATA support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_NV) [N/y/m/?] (NEW) 
  Ethernet Gadget (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_USB_ETH) [M/n/?] 
    RNDIS support (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_USB_ETH_RNDIS) [N/y/?] (NEW) 
The fact that CONFIG_USB_ETH was set in my 2.4.26 config seems to indicate
this is not a new problem.  :->
