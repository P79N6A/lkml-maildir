This was originally split out into two separate patches; one that exported
the proper symbols, and the other containing the watchdog timer.  I merged
them in the geode tree.  The patch is here:
http://git.infradead.org/?p=geode.git;a=commitdiff;h=5a840828ddb5bb7381435509a9460e0ba4aab550
That's also checkpatch.pl happy (or at least, it was when I committed it).
