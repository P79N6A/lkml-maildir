Most my MIPs time is in fixing small problems at the moment, but initiating a 
forward port to an active repository is a Good Idea.  Most of my time is 
being funneled into ARM bootloader work here lately though :(.

Yes, there have been a lot of toolchain issues with MIPs.  The last time I 
went on a toolchain testing binge for MIPs was with GCC CVS in about April.  
I had really good results with that toolchain with both the kernel and 
userland.  I did some micro tests with 3.0 and they appeared solid, but I had 
updated to the latest non-CVS version of bintools and it was chocking out 
lots of assembler warnings when rebuilding glibc.  There are source and 
binary snaps of that toolchain on the agenda FTP site under snow.
Thanks,
Shane Nay.
