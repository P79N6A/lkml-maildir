This is unreal! 
Have you tried 2.6.5 by the way?
What is it you are benchmarking if you can say?

Subject: Slow down across kernels
Hello,
Please cc me as I am not on this mailing list.
I have an issue with the 2.6 kernels that I am unable
to understand and correct.
I have a custom binary that I have used to compile
across different kernel versions and I am getting
vildly different numbers:
(as reported by time):
2.4.21-9  ~45s
2.4.22    ~55s
2.6.1     ~3m.40s
2.6.2     ~4m.00
2.6.3     ~4m.00
2.6.6     ~3m.15s
2.6.6-mm4 ~1m.30s
It is most shocking how much more time is spent in
user/kernel in comparsion:
2.4.21-9
5.09user 9.04system 0:43.79elapsed 32%CPU
(0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (7378946major+1139090minor)pagefaults
0swaps
VS.
2.6.6-mm4
13.06user 23.80system 1:32.00elapsed 40%CPU
(0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+7537027minor)pagefaults
0swaps
The system is AMD Opteron 246 w/12G RAM and broadcom
Ge.  To rule out network issues, I have moved the
files to the local files system, ext2 on a UW320
drive.
I have also tested this on a dual Xeon 3.06GHz w/8G
RAM ge with very similar results in differences across
the kernels.
strace and make -d show no major differences.
Kernels are built with gcc323/340 and bintuils
2.13.2.1.
Could someone help me understand what is at issue
here?
Thank you and appreciate the help.
Phy
