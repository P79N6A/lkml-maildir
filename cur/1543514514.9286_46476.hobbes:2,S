I'm merging the per-cpu arrays (local_bh_count, local_irq_count,...)
into a cache-line aligned per-cpu array, but I'm stuck in
arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:
/*
 * Scan the memory blocks for an SMP configuration block.
 */
static int __init smp_get_mpf(struct intel_mp_floating *mpf)
{
[...]
       if (mpf->mpf_feature1 > 4) {
                printk("Bus #1 is PCI\n");
                /*
                 * Set local APIC version to the integrated form.
                 * It's initialized to zero otherwise, representing
                 * a discrete 82489DX.
                 */
                apic_version[0] = 0x10;
                apic_version[1] = 0x10;
        }
[...]
}
why only apic_version[{0,1}]?
Can I replace it with this line, or will it break on some hardware?
	for(i=0;i<NR_CPUS;i++) cpu_data[i].apic_version=0x10;
AFAICS, the function is called before the secondary cpu's are started,
and the apic_version is overwritten later.
Thanks,
	Manfred
