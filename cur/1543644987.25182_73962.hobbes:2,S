Well, we have two situations:
 - the page is shared. In which case we don't need to put it on any 
   pinning list, since the very sharedness of the page means that we won't
   be COW'ing it in this address space.
 - the page is private. In which case we can (and should) pre-COW it and 
   make it anonymous at futex time.
So yeah, it should be doable.
Not pretty.
