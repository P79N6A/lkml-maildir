Do you know how large the difference is between the 20267 (old driver)
and the 20269 (new driver) in the areas touched by these patches?
Long ago I tried a 20267 PCI card in my PowerMac, and it had the same
issues that the 20269 card had. So I'm interested in porting the
calibration/timing fixes to pdc202xx_old.c.
