Don't know what kind of information are you looking for, but package
"raidtools" (available in every Linux distribution known to mankind)
includes some manpages, which include useful information. 
There is also a HOWTO available (Software-RAID-HOWTO), there are
replacement RAID utilities "mdadm" at
http://freshmeat.net/redir/mdadm/29423/url_homepage/mdadm
and in the end you always have the source code.
