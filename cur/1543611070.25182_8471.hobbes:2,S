i've done this change as part of the sched_yield() fixes/cleanups, and the
main reason for it is that the current process is preferred *anyway*, due
to getting the +1 boost via current->mm == this_mm in goodness().
(and besides, the percentage/probability of cases where we'd fail reselect
a runnable process where the previous scheduler would reselect it is very
very low. It does not justify adding a branch to the scheduler hotpath
IMO. In 99.9% of the cases if a runnable process is executing schedule()
then there is a higher priority process around that will win the next
selection. Or if there is a wakeup race, then the process will win the
selection very likely because it won the previous selection.)
