Unfortunately this won't work very well in our case since it's
specifically high order allocations that we are after, and we don't have
the extra RAM to allow for this.

I haven't been able to think of any really good way to implement this, so
here's my current half-assed solution..
This adds a mempool_alloc_from_pool() to do the allocation directly from
the pool first if there are elements available, otherwise it defaults to
the mempool_alloc() behaviour (and no, I haven't commented it yet, since
it would be futile if no one likes this approach). It's at least fairly
minimalistic, and saves us from doing stupid things with the gfp_mask in
mempool_alloc().
