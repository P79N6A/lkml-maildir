Ick, why are you ignoring what we have already with dev_printk() and
friends?  We are just finally getting developers to use that, I think it
will be almost impossible to get people to change to something else,
especially one that isn't even as "correct" as what dev_printk() offers
you today, will be quite hard.
So, why not use what we already have and work off of it?
thanks,
