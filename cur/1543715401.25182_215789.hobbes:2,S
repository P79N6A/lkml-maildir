just /proc/interrupts and dmegs output. If someone is interested, please
ask for them]
Hi Len
Please find attached /proc/interrupts and dmesg from 3 boots, 2 with new
kernel.
263 : gentoo-dev-sources-r1 2.6.3 kernel with Ross Dickson's idleC1halt
and IOAPIC patches.
265: gentoo-dev-sources-r1 2.6.5 kernel with Ross Dickson's idleC1halt
for 2.6.5 kernel only. Note in 265pi (/proc/interrupts):
0:      54821          XT-PIC  timer
265-lb: gentoo-dev-sources-r1 2.6.5 kernel with Ross Dickson's
idleC1halt for 2.6.5 kernel and your patch for the interrupt. 
Note in 265pi-lb (/proc/interrupts):
0:      51144    IO-APIC-edge  timer
so.. looks good here. :) I was surprised to see this effect with no boot
kernel option though. Having read the code I see you set the value to 1
and therefore on. Seems fine to me.
regards
Craig
