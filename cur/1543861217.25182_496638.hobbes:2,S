Subject: [GIT PATCH] Driver core fix for 2.6.20-rc3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/5/192

Here is a single driver core patch for 2.6.20-rc3.  It somehow got
dropped in the last round of patches for 2.6.20-rc1, and has been in the
-mm tree for quite a while.  It fixes an issue with driver names in
modules to make sure we do not create duplicate symlinks.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
