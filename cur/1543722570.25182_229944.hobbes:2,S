Okay, lets make it explicit.
On one school server, theres 10MB quota. (Okay, its admins are
BOFHs^H^H^H^H^HSISAL). Everyone tries to run mozilla there (because
its installed as default!), and immediately fills his/her quota with
cache files, leading to failed login next time (gnome just will not
start if it can't write to ~).
Imagine mozilla automatically marking cache files "elastic".
That would solve the problem -- mozilla caches would go away when disk
space was demanded, still mozilla's on-disk caching would be effective
when there is enough disk space.
