It's pretty clear Alan isn't talking about those cases.  I don't think he 
would have suggested fsync() to address the delayed write error problem in 
a case where fsync() is "return 0;".
But let's talk about the no-op fsync() cases:  fsync() is supposed to 
cause data to be written to stable storage.  "stable" is a relative 
concept that the individual filesystem type or driver has to define for 
itself.  In an ordinary disk-based filesystem, we usually expect it to 
mean the data has gone onto the oxide.  But that's not really stable -- 
the disk drive could break and the data would be gone.  For some, just 
getting into the buffers of the disk drive is stable enough, since then 
rebooting Linux wouldn't cause the data to be lost.  For ramfs, the Linux 
page cache is as stable as you can hope for.
So I view it as correct even if fsync() does nothing on a disk-based 
filesystem because the programmer was lazy (or because the user wants to 
defeat the performance-busting behavior of some paranoid application). But 
when Alan speaks of a "not completely correct" version of synchronization, 
which makes me think of something that doesn't implement any consistent 
form of "stable," I want to hear more.
