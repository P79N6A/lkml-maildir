This is a tricky situation, no doubt about it.
Your situation is a little different from the usual one because ps->devsem
locks the whole device, not just a single interface.  It should still be
able to work.  But maybe you're right; since ps->devsem locks the same
thing as ps->dev->serialize, maybe it's not needed.  By the way, when
usbfs takes ownership of a device, does it bind to the device's
interfaces?

You may simply have to release the lock because calling 
usb_set_configuration and then reacquire it afterwards.
That leads to the question of how to assure that the device doesn't go 
away before usb_set_configuration is called.  Perhaps 
usb_set_configuration and usb_unbind_interface should be changed to 
require the caller to hold the serialize lock.

I mean it won't cause an oops, although it might provide an invalid 
result.  It's not _required_ by the API (maybe it should be).
Actually, there's another sense in which it's not necessary.  Since
changing configurations first involves unbinding the existing drivers, if
you hold a driver-private lock that will block your disconnect routine
then you can safely call usb_ifnum_to_if even without holding
dev->serialize.

I didn't note the reason for the oops.  Was it a segmentation violation?  
The usb_device memory isn't deallocated until the reference count goes to 
0.  Maybe something was doing an extra usb_put_dev.
