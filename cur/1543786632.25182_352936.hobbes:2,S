These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness and interactivity. 
It is configurable to any workload but the default ck* patch is aimed at the 
desktop and ck*-server is available with more emphasis on serverspace.
THIS INCLUDES ALL THE PATCHES IN 2.6.13.2 SO YOU SHOULD START WITH 2.6.13 TO 
USE THESE PATCHES
Apply to 2.6.13
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.13/2.6.13-ck6/patch-2.6.13-ck6.bz2
or server version
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.13/2.6.13-ck6/patch-2.6.13-ck6-server.bz2
*prefetching should still be considered experimental*
I appreciate the extensive testing it is receiving!

Split patches available.
Changes:
Added:
+sched-iso_tunables.patch
Add a tunable in /proc/sys/kernel/iso_cpu to allow you to set the amount of 
cpu that SCHED_ISO tasks run realtime. It is 70% by default on -ck and 0% by 
default on -ckserver.
+ck5_sp11.patch
Massive update to the swap prefetching code to version 11. This makes the 
decision when to prefetch far more intelligent, the cost of the code much 
cheaper on SMP/preempt, fixes bugs, and substantially decreases the risk of 
the code causing out-of-memory conditions. The code is very safe and stable 
and quite effective. The incidence of regressions has dropped dramatically 
now but it still does need more testing.
Removed:
-per-task-predictive-write-throttling-1.patch
This patch is causing as yet not well understood problems with I/O pauses so 
it has been removed till it is developed and tested further in -mm.
Modified:
-2613ck5-version.diff
+2613ck6-version.diff
Version update
Cheers,
Con
