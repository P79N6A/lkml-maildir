It sounds unnecessarily complex, and unnecessarily different from our
normal expectations of /proc files.  And the value we read differs from the
value we wrote...  I think having a non-zero default will be fine.

Marginal, I think.  This is not likely to be a field which a lot of people
modify a lot of times.  Those few people who need to work with this can
afford to look the values up in the documentation while writing their
script.
And it requires a distressingly large amount of code to implement a /proc
file.  Perhaps in this situation the code can be shared.
otoh, why is it a /proc thing at all?
unsigned long sys_set_corefile_filter(unsigned long enable_mask);
unsigned long sys_clear_corefile_filter(unsigned long enable_mask);
would be better?
