I'm a Win32 developer by day, and I'm pretty familiar with
the innards of COM.  But I can't think of a _single_ instance
of anything in COM or COM+ which is dependent on the kernel,
or which lives on the kernel-side of the kernel-mode/usr-mode
boundary.
COM and COM+ (and even .NET) are user-mode libraries and
conventions.
The closest thing _inside_ the WinNT/2K/XP kernel to your
"object model" is the hierarchical directory of refcounted
and ACLed objects inside the kernel (which is basically sysfs
with ACLs).
Can you give me _one_ example of a "consistent object model"
between kernel and user mode in Windows?  Maybe then we'll
have a better understanding of what you're really looking
for.
Later,
Kenn
