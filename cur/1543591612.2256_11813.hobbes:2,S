You would not notice the difference, only your kernel would be
a bit smaller and the RRPART ioctl disappears.
[Besides: we have lived with DOS-type partition tables for ten years,
but they will not last another ten years. Very soon disk partitions
will look very different. It will be good to move knowledge about
these things out of the kernel before this happens.]
