Thanks for verifying these bugs ;)
The interrupt checker checks for inconsistent interrupt states. For
example, if a function has one exit point with interrupt disabled, and
another exit point with interrupt enabled, the checker will report an
error at the second exit point. The code snippets are automatically culled
from the source based on the line number in the error report. So the
reporting is sometimes misleading. I'll put the actuall line number in the
comments.

It may be better to have two exit points, one for normal path and one for
error path. All error handling code can be put at the end of the function.
