we'll get rid of that pt_regs thing centrally, from all drivers at once 
- there's upstream buy-in for that already, and Thomas already generated 
a test-patch for that a few months ago. But it's not a big issue right 
now.

this shouldnt be a big issue either - we use indirect jumps all around 
the kernel. CPUs are either smart enough to predict it, or they simply 
dont have that high penalties. (and if they have high penalties but dont 
optimize for it then genirq will be the last of their worries. The VFS 
and the MM is full of function pointers.)

please be more specific, how is this not possible via genirq?

hm, i'm not sure what you mean - could you be more specific?

but ... somehow the current FRV code does figure out which IRQ source 
fired, right? How is that a hindrance for a genirq/irqchips based 
design?

oops, i missed it - just acked it. (This problem too was a side-effect 
of FRV having its own IRQ layer.)
