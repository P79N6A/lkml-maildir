It also wasn't you I referred to in the above comment, nor was it
Alan Cox. I saw both those comments in posts from people I didn't
recognise, and you know I've been on this list long enough to
recognise all of the regulars...

Perhaps. He's certainly wrong in what he claims.

I have to admit that I hadn't even seen the post you refer to when I
wrote the reply quoted.

All too true.

Before *I* take him seriously again, I expect him to have posted fixes
for ALL THREE of those bugs, and not only to Alan but to this list as
well.
Best wishes from Riley.
