Uhmm... Maybe a problem with the backboost interactivity enhancements.
Does this happen with command-line apps like mpg123, mpg321, ogg123,
etc? In my case, I've experienced those "sound skips" when using XMMS,
but not mpg123 or ogg123. I think it's both a "corner-case" problem with
the interactivity changes in the 2.5-series scheduler and XMMS itself.
