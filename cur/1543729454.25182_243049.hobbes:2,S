Subject: [PATCH] Bind Mount Extensions 0.05
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings!
The following patch extends the 'noatime', 'nodiratime' and
last but not least the 'ro' (read only) mount option to the
vfs --bind mounts, allowing them to behave like any other
mount, by honoring those mount flags (which are silently
ignored by the current implementation in 2.4.x and 2.6.x)
I don't want to pollute your mailbox with useless patches,
so for those who are interested in this stuff, get them
here (for 2.4.27 and 2.6.8.1)

many thanks to Willy Tarreau for spotting the bug in the
previous bme0.04 for linux 2.4.x.
enjoy,
Herbert
