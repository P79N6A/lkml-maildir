Do patches already send to you but not present in this release
got queued for -pre9 or got lost in the process and you want
them resubmitted (or maybe you just want them later for 2.4.19-pre1).
I'm talking here about the sonypi driver update, but I guess there
are other people asking themselfs the same thing for other patches,
given the delay between pre7 and pre8...
Stelian.
