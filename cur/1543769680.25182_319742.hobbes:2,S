Kay,
I am sorry for being slow with these patches but I really do spend all
time that I can on kernel. Unfortunately, there are also other input
problems (KVMs causing mice lose sync), and since BK is gone and there
is a big backlog of input patches in Vojtech's tree I am unable to get
patches easily in mm. I was thinking about creating a git tree or a
quilt export but I don't have a place to host them ;(
