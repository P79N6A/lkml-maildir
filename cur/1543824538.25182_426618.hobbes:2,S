Err. That's why you use demultiplexers. The demux handler is always
NODELAY.
shared IRQ
-> demux_handler
	disable shared irq
	identify interrupt sources
	for all sources:
		calculate the interrupt number
		irq_desc[number]->handle_irq(.....)
			disable/ack a particular source
			if NODELAY 
				call handler and reenable if appropriate
			else 
				wakeup thread
	enable shared irq
That's the way you really want to do it. Granted, that this is not
possible with the current implementation of PCI cards, but for the SoC
peripherals this is usually simple to do.
The ARM tree has tons of examples which do exactly this.
