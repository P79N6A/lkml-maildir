    I stand corrected then.  While inquiring about FreeBSD large file
support and the availability of a journaling filesystem because of the
possible need for some of my Samba/NFS servers to serve > 2GB files as well
as the definate need to alleviate the long fsck delay, one of the responses
claimed that journaling support was there and his FreeBSD systems fscked
large volumes very quicky.

    After rechecking the kernel menuconfig I found the option combination to
activate it.  Originally I had looked for FFS which appeared and said it was
for the Amiga not FreeBSD, I didn't expect to find it under a different name
UFS which I've always assumed was Solaris.

    And softupdates is what gave me responder his quick fsck time?  Ok I
see.  Thanks.
