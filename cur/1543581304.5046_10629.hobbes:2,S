airo is a module for the cisco aironet wireless network cards. I have a
pcmcia 342, and a pci 342 (which just looks like a pcmcia card mounted
on a pci board). The pcmcia cards in my notebook seemes to work ok
(can't test, but the /proc interface works fine and the card reacts on
that), but the pci in my pc gives the above problem. Also tried -ac5.
/var/log/syslog only says:
Feb  9 01:52:52 tilde kernel: airo:  Probing for PCI adapters

The system sometimes seemes to be fine after this, and sometimes it
freezes. The nic doesn't work. 
What can I do to provide more info?
