The other day, I upgraded the components of a software package
that I maintain, including updating the kernel from 2.4.18 to
2.4.20.
I noticed something strange: / is now listed twice in /proc/mounts
like this
rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0
/dev/root / ext2 rw 0 0
It confused one of my scripts, so I had to implement a quick workaround.
Is this a feature or a bug?
