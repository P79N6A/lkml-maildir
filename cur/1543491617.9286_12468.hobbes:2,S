Reiserfs does not get it absolutely right just yet, but I've been
talking with them about performance issues and they are definitely
looking for ways to optimise this sort of thing.  Their tree-based
on-disk structure means that they have a lot more flexibility in
choosing how to lay out data than a table-based filesystem like ext2fs
does.
