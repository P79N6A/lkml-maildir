Huh??  The driver has no clue what open file-descriptor needs
whatever special handling. When a polled-for event occurs, a
bit is put into what will be the poll return value in the driver
and any process sleeping in poll ** that is waiting for that bit **
gets awakened. That's why I need to use some of the "spare" bits.
Only the task that's waiting for its specific bit gets awakened
in user-mode.
