Version 2.5.2 of perfctr, the Linux/x86 performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
Version 2.5.2, 2003-04-13
- Updated power management code for the local APIC and NMI
  watchdog driver model changes in kernel 2.5.67.
- Timer-based sampling of per-process performance counters is
  now always enabled: previously it was only done on SMP.
  Needed to avoid counter inaccuracies on high core-clock CPUs.
- Fixes to user-space library implementation of remote-control
  virtual performance counters: open() failed due to a missing
  return; avoid potential buffer overflow error; fix the "read
  counters" procedure for the case where the remote process is
  sampling the time-stamp counter but no performance counters.
- Added support for RedHat 9's 2.4.20-8 and 2.4.20-9 kernels.
