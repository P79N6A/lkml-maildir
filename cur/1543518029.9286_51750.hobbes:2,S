Make sure the VGA console is compiled in (omitting it is possible when
using
framebuffer)
The VGA= parameter in lilo.conf selects mode.  These modes are explained
in 
the framebuffer howto.  Some gives framebuffers of various resolutions,
some
give textmode.  VGA=290 gives me a 100x30 textmode for example.  (That
particular
setting may or may not work for you.) You may
also try VGA=ASK , you will then get a prompt at boot-time, which is
fine
for experimentation.  When you find a mode you like, substitute that
number
for "ASK".
