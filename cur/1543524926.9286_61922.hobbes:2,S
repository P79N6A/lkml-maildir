Very sorry WARNING: the above patch had a silly bug! A new (improved) one
is just ready though. I'll upload and announce soon.
The 2.2.x versions (-1 and -2 revisions) are unaffected by the bug thus
people using elevator-starvation-[12] against 2.2.14 can continue to use
them without any worry.
I'll release elevator-starvation-4.gz for both 2.2.14 and 2.3.42 the same
time though, since the new things I did in the 2.3.42 upcoming version are
good to have also in 2.2.14 (but for 2.2.x the update is only
a performance issues and none upgrade is necessary).

Yes the complexity and changes to the rest of the queue is definitely ugly
:( but breking scsi and all other blockdevices may be even uglier... So
for now I hurt CPU usage that nevertheless is still zero in the profiling
during heavy I/O load. After all the result of the algorithm would be the
same, only complexity changes.

_Completly_ agreed. I just had this in mind since I am been very happy to
notice the cool work that is been done on the ll_rw_block layer where now
the request_queue_t is available in the high layer. I'll try do that in
the -5 revision (the -4 revision is just ready and I just tested it for
both 2.2.x and 2.3.x and in the 2.2.x case I can't do better than that).
