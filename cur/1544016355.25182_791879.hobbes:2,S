for example, this measurement works just fine currently:
aldebaran:~/linux/linux> timec -e 1 timec -e 1 timec -e 1 make -j16 kernel/

The performance counters are layered upon each other in each nested timec 
instance. In the innermost instance ls runs with 3+3 performance counters 
active at once - and it all just works, without the timec apps having any 
knowledge about each other.
And that is i think what powerful kernel abstractions are about. If we 
provide nice and useful abstractions then the hw folks will eventually 
extend the hw side resources, if users keep bumping into them.
If we structure our design around the limitations then users wont actually 
ever bump into the hw limitations in a clear-cut way - they will bump into 
our design. So they'll pester us, not the hw folks ;-)
Such details are the main difference between the perfmon design and the 
perfcounters design.
