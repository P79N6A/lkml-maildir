It always was experimental, as I recall. Karl Gutwin is the author.

linux-usb-users@lists.sourceforge.net is a more appropriate forum.

It's better than most :-) You probably have a different version of the
camera, with a different firmware, hardware or sensor.

Indeed, the decoder of the camera datastream is not working. Everything
else, past the decoder, seems to work.

Check the dates, maybe in-kernel driver is more recent. Contact Karl.

This is a rare camera, as I understand. Nobody else has it.

Karl Gutwin. His email is at the URL that I gave above.

If there is that mysterious "someone", it is not anyone I know. As I

was developed in first place, using specs, reverse engineering or just
black magic...
