Sorry to keep replying to myself. I've done some runs
with my IO scheduler regression tests and these patches
don't make a significant difference one way or the other
although the results with the patches are generally a
bit better.
Tested OraSim pgbench nickbench tiobench and the read/ls
kernel tree during a streaming read/write. 256MB RAM
this time.
