I didn't receive any email for bk-commits-24@vger.kernel.org after August 1
(ChangeSet 1.1052, 2003/08/01 10:24:28-03:00, marcelo@logos.cnet).
Anyone else seeing this problem, or did I get unsubscribed?

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
