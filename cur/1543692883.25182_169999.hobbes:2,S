The card is managed by the os - X has to ask the kernel nicely to get it.
(Try starting another X server inside an xterm and see how
that is refused.)
The details of drawing the windows is something the os don't
need to worry about though - that is the job of X.
Please explain whats wrong about "3rd party developers".  Depending on
how you look at it, all of linux is "3rd part developers" except from Linus.

Explain the immoral part. Committing a crime is (usually) immoral.
Designing software in a way you dislike isn't.

So?
Having graphichs in the kernel would *not* change this at all.
You would still have to wait for graphichs support for your card.
The kernel would still have to support i810 agp gart.
Linux doesn't support every graphics solution in existence.  That is
a fact of life.  Wheter the missing part is in kernel or somewhere
else doesn't matter at all.  It either works or it don't.

This sentence didn't make sense to me.  Syntax error? :-)

Sure.  Having the kernel provide graphichs would eliminate X, if the
kernel would support all the stuff X supports.  But whats the
_point_ of eliminating X?
1. It wouldn't be faster
2. You wouldn't get support for more cards this way
3. It wouldn't be better in other ways either
Using X for graphichs is nice however, for several reasons:
1. Separation of kernel and graphichs system.  This means
    we can trivially run without graphichs if we don't need it.
    And yes - there are many such uses for linux.  The desktop
    is merely one of many places where you find linux.
2. There would be fewer graphichs developers for linux with
    the graphichs in-kernel.  Today X is used not only by linux people,
    it is also used by other unices like bsd, and others too.
    A bsd/os2/... X developer working on X today will benefit linux
    too.  That won't happen with a graphichs system internal to linux.
