Hi all,
I'm running kernel 2.2.17pre12 on my Pentium 166 with 64meg RAM etc..
Had a solid lock crash on my system, was using it happily, turned away for
an hour and when i came back to the shell it had locked up, when i got
home from work i plugged a monitor into my main server and had a screen
full of the following message:
kmem_alloc: Bad slab magic (corrupt) (name=size-128)
Anyone have any ideas?
I only just patched up to this version, was previously using 2.2.17pre4
without drama..
This error meaningful to anyone?
Regards, Jim.
