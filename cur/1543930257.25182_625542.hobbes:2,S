Excellent idea! I'd love to have this in RHEL5u1, because that would make
that distro boot on certain machines that have more memory than is supported
without an iommu driver. The problem we have is that when you simply
say mem=1G but all of the first gigabyte is on the first node, you end
up with a memoryless node, which is not supported.
Unfortunately, it comes too late for me now, as all new distros already boot
on Cell machines that need an IOMMU.
