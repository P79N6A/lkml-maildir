Ah, ok. The annoying thing is that the same machine used to have NT4
on it and that never crashed... Well, not "hard" like this anyway. Also,
we've been seeing some reasonable uptimes, like 40+ days, but then it
happens three our four times within a week. There is no real pattern. 
If we put something CPU intensive in there, like a distributed.net or a
GIMPS client it locks up within a few days.

Yeah, I just wish we had the budget to get a new machine to try that
out... Might be in a better position now that Compaq is starting to
support Linux :) I just hope this includes these "old" machines.
Anyway, thanks for your tips!
