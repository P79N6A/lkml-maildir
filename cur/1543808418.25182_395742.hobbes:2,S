hi
i have a SATA hardisk, and am using FC4 with default kernel
(2.6.14-1.1644_FC4). i was wondering if it's possible to tell the kernel to use
the old ATA driver with SATA support instead of libata, for my harddisk to
appear as hdX, and not sdX.
(please CC the answers, as i'm not on the list)
thank you.
