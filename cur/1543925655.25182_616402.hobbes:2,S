The complement of "open source" is not closed source, or at least
"source not available". (And I doubt it's even illegal to look at
source you have somehow got.) It includes so-called license-free 
or license-less software [1] as well -- something I'm likely to do
with any of my future work, if I release the source at all.

It's been a constant downfall ever since I started using Linux in '95
or so. None of the gripes I had then have been fixed (the bloatware
known as the X server is still allowed to hang the system), and many 
other things have been turned into crap, largely due to world domination
plans. (See the "idiot box Linux" link in one of the recent posts.)

Indeed, Microsoft is offering the only alternative to the suffocating
monoculturist hegemony promoted by the major FOSS projects. (OS X
is too much like Gnome.)
