I'll say that as a user I hate having to deal with bugzilla.
there's nothing more frustrating then spending a good chunk of time trying to 
find a similar bug, then jumping through all the bugzilla hoops to file a report 
to eventually (days/weeks later) get a message 'closed becouse it's a duplicate 
report), then have to go and track down what it's a duplicate of, read through 
that bug report, only to find that it's not solved there either, and to top it 
off, the people working on that bug won't see my report or that I'm available to 
troubleshoot it.
from a user poit of view, e-mailing the kernel list (retrying a few days later 
of there is no response) tends to work _much_ better.
