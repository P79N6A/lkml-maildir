Hello,
We are experiencing some lockup problems with our SMP configuration. 
Here are the details :
- The computers lockup with no relevant logs.
- The kernel still replies to ping but higher level services are not
responding.
- After few hours (5-8), the kernel answers again and the load is around
40 then decreasing. 
We manage to get some SysRq showPc output (screenshot :

)
According to the basic sysreq debugging, the problem seems to be related
to the function flush_tlb_all, and it is triggered with a write or read
(local or on nfs sometimes).
I looked at the LKML, and didn't find any known issues.
Maybe it has been corrected but not backported by redhat ! 
I'll appreciate any help.
Thank you in advance.
detailed configuration :
---------------
Processor   : 2 x 2.8Ghz Pentium Xeon
Motherboard : Intel se7501cw2
Memory      : 4 x 512MB DDR 266 ECC registered
Kernel      : 2.4.20-31 (Redhat 7.3 with updates)
