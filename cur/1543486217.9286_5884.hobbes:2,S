Hmm. Since the symptoms of this problem (insmod hangs) are almost the same
as with the earlier multi-lun patch (the insmod hangs but during modprobe
ide-scsi), maybe this message just show why it fails (and the bug is the
same)? Anyway, with ac6 I can enable multi-lun support and load ide-scsi
successfully. The problem came later and _may_ be realted to the
translation problem.
