You can get SMI's for more than just ECC events, suppressing the ECC
SMI's won't save you from the other SMI events that could happen.  
We need to work something out with the bios guys to do this right.
Today we don't have a good way of coordinating between the payload OS
and the BIOS for this type of platform level stuff.
