you can't wait until it is perfect. Then it never gets merged. The out- 
of-tree ISDN stuff has always been painful. And that was already in  
the ISDN4Linux days which were Linux 2.2 days or even earlier.
My proposal is to merge mISDN and then see what falls out. My guess it  
won't be that bad as everybody thinks and then we go from there. Next  
step is to remove ISDN4Linux since that should not be used at all  
anymore.
