I am running a multithreaded application on Linux 2.4
kernel (RedHat Linux 9).
At some point the program receives a seg. fault and if
i check info threads, using gdb for debug, almost all
the threads are at "0xffffe002 in ??" 
When I switch to each of these tasks, and try x/i for
0xffffe002, cannot access address.
What could be the problem?
Please help.
Regards,
Pav.
