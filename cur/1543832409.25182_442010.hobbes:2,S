I think everyone agrees with that.  However, the problem is we already have
two of them and one is out of the tree.  Each of them has its supporters who
believe their implementation of choice is "better" and want it to become
the Only One.  Unfortunately the implementations are not 100% mergeable for
technical reasons and the out-of-the-tree one is more feature-rich.
Now there seem to be two possible ways to go:
1) Drop the implementation that already is in the kernel and replace it with
the out-of-the-tree one.
2) Improve the one that already is in the kernel incrementally, possibly
merging some code from the out-of-the-tree implementation, so that it's as
feature-rich as the other one.
Apparently 1) is what Nigel is trying to make happen and 2) is what I'd like
to do.
