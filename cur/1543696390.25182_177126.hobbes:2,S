No, the restart code is fine. But the posix timer code looks fundamentally 
broken. Try the patch I just sent, I bet it fixes it.
I can try to fix the posix-timer.c code too, but it looks like even modern
glibc doesn't even export the clock_nanosleep() function. So it might not 
be worth fixing at this point..
