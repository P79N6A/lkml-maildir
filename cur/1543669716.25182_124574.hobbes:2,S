You need 'Virtual terminal' and 'Console on VT' enabled:
$ grep VT .config
CONFIG_VT=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
$
But this brings me to the main issue .. any reason why you need
to have INPUT=y to be able to select CONFIG_VT and CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE ?
If INPUT=m for instance, it is not present ...
Won't it be better to make CONFIG_INPUT a bool (only y or n), as with
this setup, you can still compile the other input drivers as modules ..

Sorry, I am not sure who does this bit, so I CC'd Andrew as well, as
I want to remember that he did some changes to VT and SERIAL console
in the past.
