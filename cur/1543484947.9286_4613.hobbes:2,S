Hi all!
I just encountered a problem while trying to use
put_user and memcpy_tofs while handling an interrrupt
in 2.0.x .
The idea behind this is fast IO. The user creates some
buffer space and the kernel routine fills it 
directly from hardware to user space. Unfortunately
the machine just crashes. Am i not allowed to use the
above functions in an interrupt?
Ciao,
  Till
