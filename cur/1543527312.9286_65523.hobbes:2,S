Several have been suggested, but Linus hasn't liked any of them.
Personally, I'd like to see all of the sysconf() information vectored
directly from the kernel.  Make sysconf() a system call (if it isn't
already) and then make every one of the POSIX/UNIX98 standard variables
available from the kernel -- most of it should already be in the kernel
somewhere.
(_SC_NPROCESSORS_* (without parsing cpuinfo) would certainly shut me up :-))
