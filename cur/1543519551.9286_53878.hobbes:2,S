As a followup to my previous message, I can now inform that an oops also
happened with kernel 2.3.33 and the built-in pcmcia modules.
I wasn't really doing anything with the laptop at the time, I had several
programs (including window manager and dockapps) open on the PC X server
display but was typing something in a PC program - not one of the programs
running on the laptop. The network load can't have been really high.
The laptop has now been relatively stable for a while, running 2.3.33, but
instead of having the windows from the laptop managed by a WM running on the
laptop, the X server now uses local WM. So the overall load on the laptop
and on the network is a lot lighter.
The main difference between now and previously when I wasn't experiencing
crashes, is the version of binutils (2.9.5.0.22 now, versus 2.9.5.0.19 or
2.9.5.0.16 before -- actually, I'm not even sure about that, it was perhaps
even an older version, namely the one coming with SuSE 6.1 by default. Darn,
why can't I remember now such things as when exactly I installed the new
binutils!). It would be a rather time-consuming experiment to see if
reverting to an older binutils makes things better!
Unfortunately the oops I got on 2.3.33 was again unusable because it
disappeared from the screen mostly. Wouldn't it be possible to catch oopsen
to a special area on disk, or to a special file that is created at startup
and with sufficient amount of space reserved to hold the data for a few
oopsen?
Catching an oops would be significantly easier if an oops could be captured
across system reboots without having to attach something to the serial port,
etc. But that method can not rely normal systems operations, like syslogd,
to get the oops to you...
Anyone who can give some advice?
