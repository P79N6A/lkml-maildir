An alternate approach is:
- pull the minimum parts of SHA (and perhaps MD5) out of their
  respective cryptoapi modules into the core
- call that code directly from random, bypassing cryptoapi (and
  avoiding all the dynamic allocation and potential sleeping stuff)
Combined with a patch that does non-unrolled SHA, this should be about
the same as the present code.

As the primary benefit here is elimination of duplicate code, I think
that's a non-starter.

Ok, can I export some more cryptoapi primitives?
  __crypto_lookup_alg(const char *name);
  __crypto_alg_tfm_size(const char *name);
  __crypto_setup_tfm(struct crypto_alg *alg, char *buf, int size, int flags);
  __crypto_exit_ops(...)
  __crypto_alg_put(...);
This would let me do alg lookup in my init and avoid the dynamic
allocation sleeping and performance hits.
Also, I posted to cryptoapi-devel that I need a way to disable the
unconditional padding on the hash functions.
