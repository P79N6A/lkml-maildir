Just to clarify it... From the host view it's not the chipset
it's a channel we have to deal with. And there are typically two
channels on a host. For the serialized parts, we have to
possiblities:
1. Preserve the current behaviour of using additionally a global
lock.
2. "Cheat" and reuse the lock from the primary channel during
the initialization of the secondary channel.
Hmmm.... Thinking a bit about it I'm now conviced that 2. is more
elegant then 1. And finally this will
just allow us to make the hwgroup_t go entierly away.
The only thing that worries me are the checks for hwgroupt_t's
only remaining member -> handler use to determine whatever some
IRQ is pending or not.
