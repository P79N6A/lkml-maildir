The good reason is why update the current position? I just told the
kernel to ignore the current position and use the given offset, why
would I bother updating the current position? The whole point of
providing an offset is to ignore the current position.
I must say I cannot understand why you are confused or find this
illogical, it makes perfect sense to me.

I didn't read the man page, I read the source. And it clearly updates
the file offset, in fact the actual sendfile portion is just a supplied
actor to the generic page cache read functions.

Maybe you didn't understand me correctly. Basically what sys_sendfile()
ends up doing is:
        if (offset_given)
                ppos = &offset_given;
        else
                ppos = &in_fd->current_position;
ppos is always updated. sendfile() behaves as I described, it updates
ppos which is _EITHER_ the supplied offset _OR_ the current file offset.
You said that sendfile() never changes in in_fd offset, which is clearly
false as it always updates it if you don't pass in an offset. If you do
pass in an offset, that and only that is changed. The lseek() comment of
course applied to the case where you _don't_ give an explicit offset and
the current position is used.
If you don't believe me, read the source and do another test app.
splice() behaves identically, as previously stated.
