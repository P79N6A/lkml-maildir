Not so fast.... :(
Here are the numbers (P2-400, 128MB SDRAM, one IDE drive), but the
interesting part is below:
./hogmem 200 3
Memory speed: 6.53 MB/sec
./hogmem 100 3 & ./hogmem 100 3 &
Memory speed: 1.74 MB/sec
Memory speed: 1.71 MB/sec
With pre6, Zlatko cleanup patch and MM fix and Linus's one line patch
(try_to_free_pages), while swapping with either the one hogmem, or both
running at the same time, the system is basically unusable for interactive
use.  Keyboard and mouse input is lagged several minutes, and switching
virtual desktops in X take forever.
With plain vanilla Pre6, the two hogmems would take a very long time to
complete, and the speed was < 1 MB/sec, however, the system was pretty
usuable.  I could switch virtual desktops in about 5-6 seconds, and mouse
input was slightly lagged, but typing in an xterm had no noticeable lag.
This kernel MM stuff is way way beyond my head, but I can test stuff. :)
