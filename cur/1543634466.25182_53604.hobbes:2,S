Hmm.  My impression is that Linux has been doing SMP but mostly because
it hasn't become a nightmare so far.  Linus just a moment ago noted that
there are scaleablity limits, to SMP.
As for the cc-SMP stuff.
a) Except dual cpu systems no-one makes affordable SMPs.
b) It doesn't solve anything except your problem with locks.
You have presented your idea, and maybe it will be useful.  But at
the moment it is not the place to start. What I need today is process
checkpointing.  The rest comes in easy incremental steps from there.
For me the natural place to start is with clusters, they are cheaper
and more accessible than SMPs.  And then work on the clustering
software with gradual refinements until it can be managed as one
machine.  At that point it should be easy to compare which does a
better job for SMPs.
