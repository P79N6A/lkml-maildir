Alan, I think you know that this isn't really true, due to shared-libs.

The problem with rlimit is that it works per process.  Tuning this by hand 
may be awkward and/or wasteful.  What we need is to rlimit on a global 
basis, by calculating an upperlimit dynamically, such as to avoid 
overcommit/OOM.
Thanks!
