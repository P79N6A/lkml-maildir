The early versions of 64 bit s390x did not have the 31 bit emulation
layer. As long as only 64 bit code is executed you don't need the
16 bit uids/gids. Thats why is isn't defined.

I checked the code and didn't find any reason why this shouldn't work.
In fact with the 31 bit emulation layer the 64 bit kernel does need the
16 bit uid/gid system calls although only for the emulation. To make it
really perfect you could define CONFIG_UID16 dependent on
CONFIG_S390_SUPPORT. This saves a few bytes in the image if the emulation
support is not enabled.

Definitly.
