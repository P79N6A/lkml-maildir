Hello,
I have the following question:
If I compile the kernel (2.4.*) and boot it in, then the kernel-release,
as shown by 'uname -r' will be the string that was in the EXTRAVERSION
string from the kernel Makefile.
Is there any way to change this 'identity' of the kernel after the
compilation?
Such as
changekernelname bzImage "newname"
For example I have bzImage.test1, which I copy to bzImage.test2 (and not
complete recompile the kernel with new EXTRAVERSION string), and when
test1 boots in I would like uname to say 2.4.23-test1, and when test2
boots in to say 2.4.23-test2. And in addition to this, of course I copy
/lib/modules/2.4.23-test1 to /lib/modules/2.4.23-test2.
Cheers
Gaspar
