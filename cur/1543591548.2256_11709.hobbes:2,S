Subject: [PATCH] [RESEND] fs/binfmt_elf.c changes vs 2.4.5-pre3

Linus,
This patch against 2.4.5-pre3 makes 3 changes to fs/binfmt_elf.c:
1. It fixes the csp calculation so that it actually achieves the 16
   byte final alignment that the comment claims.  Previously the csp
   calculation didn't take the AT_NULL entry into account.  If you
   look at the current fs/binfmt_elf.c there is a "sp -= 2" that is
   not reflected in the csp calculation, unlike all the other
   decrements of sp.
2. It allows each architecture to add extra aux table entries by
   defining DLINFO_ARCH_ITEMS and ARCH_DLINFO in <asm/elf.h>.  We need
   this on PowerPC to add entries for the cache line size, and to add
   entries for compatibility with older broken glibc's.
3. It removes the extra 16 bytes that were left free for PowerPC - in
   the past we had to move the auxiliary table up to cope with broken
   glibc's (now we cope by adding special AT_IGNORE entries using the
   ARCH_DLINFO macro).
Please apply this to your tree.
Thanks,
Paul.
