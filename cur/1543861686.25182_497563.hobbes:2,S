Subject: 2.6.19.1 kernel - error messages

I run Fedora Core 6 on the 'compaq nc6320' laptop. I am using the
'2.6.19.1' kernel.
While booting the kernel, I noticed the following 3 messages:
1. PCI: BIOS Bug: MCFG area at f8000000 is not E820-reserved
    PCI: Not using MMCONFIG.
After some search, I commented out the 'e820_all_mapped()' check in
the 'pci_mmcfg_init()'
function. I no longer see this message and MMCONFIG method seems to be used now.
But, is it the correct thing to do? I get these messages with
'2.6.18.x' kernels as well.
2. synaptics reset failed
For this, I commented out the following retry loop in the
'synaptics_query_hardware()'
function as suggested on the synaptics driver website..
   while ((retries++ < 3) && psmouse_reset(psmouse))
                printk(KERN_ERR "synaptics reset failed\n");
Is this still the right thing to do?
3. usb 1-1: device not accepting address 2, error -71
I don't know what to do with this. There was a comment by someone that
this is the problem
of 'ehci-hcd' driver trying to access the usb controller while the
'uhci-hcd' driver is still working
on it.
My interest in this is that I am having troubles with 'suspend to
disk' on this machine (
with both 'swsusp' and 'software suspend 2'). The suspension itself is
not successful.
I was wondering if any of these messages (especially the 'usb' one)
are related to the
suspend problem that I have.
I have attached the 'lspci -v' output. This is a dual core laptop with
the SATA drive.
Thanks,
