yup.  I'll queue this to get it a bit of testing but won't send it to Greg,
in the expectation that an updated version will be prepared.
Please do feed the diff through scripts/checkpatch.pl too - there are a
large number of trivial coding-style glitches in there.
Also, your [patch 1/2] will break the build unless your [patch 2/2] is
applied.  This will break git bisection so please avoid it.  It is
appropriate to fold both these patches into a single one.
And please avoid sending multiple patches under the same title, as these
two were.
Thanks.
