That doesn't resolve the "2.4.x behaves badly" thing, though.
I've seen that one myself, and it seems to be simply due to the fact
that we're usually so good at gettign memory from page_launder() that we
never bother to try to swap stuff out. And when we _do_ start swapping
stuff out it just moves to the dirty list, and page_launder() will take
care of it.
So far so good. The problem appears to be that we don't swap stuff out
smoothly: we start doing the VM scanning, but when we get enough dirty
pages, we'll let it be, and go back to page_launder() again. Which means
that we don't walk theough the whole VM space, we just do some "spot
cleaning".
