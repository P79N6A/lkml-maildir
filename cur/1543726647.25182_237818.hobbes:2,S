TCP negociates the MSS which is in some sort the min of both MTU - headers.
So TCP between hosts with MTUs of 1504 and 1500 bytes will negociate an
MSS of 1460 because it's what the smaller can do. TCP is far less sensible
to MTU problems, although it often takes lors of retransmits to fix the
problem when it's not local.
