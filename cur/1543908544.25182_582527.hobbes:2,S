It is, but I stand by it.  If anyone can point out some portion of  
this which *cannot* be implemented as SELinux policy I will humbly  
step completely out of this discussion.

No, most/all of the MLS systems from the 1990s did not integrate Bell- 
LaPadula, Type Enforcement, and Role-Based-Access-Control together.   
In addition, none of the MLS systems from the 1990s had modifiable  
constraints the way SELinux does (for example I can modify the  
fundamental policy to allow a process whose domain has the  
"i_am_special" attribute to override the BLP model for certain target  
types in certain special situations, all depending on how I apply  
that attribute and those types).

Well, yes, but how exactly do you define "read", "write", and  
"execute" for the full list of SELinux object classes found here:
http://www.tresys.com/selinux/obj_perms_help.html
I was considering compiling the complete list, but such an exercise  
would take me at least an hour to do properly and which categories  
individual permissions should be placed in could be argued for  
weeks.  The SELinux reference policy doesn't even completely qualify  
all of those things with MLS restrictions, and they're the ones who  
got the hooks implemented originally.
Specifically, do you classify the bind() syscall as a "read" or a  
"write" operation.  How would you classify accept()?  In order to  
support the full range of security controls that Linux has hooks for,  
you would need to identify a list of how to define "read", "write",  
and "execute" for every object-class in that massive list.   
Furthermore you would need to ensure that the definitions work for  
every process.  From the variations between different portions of the  
SELinux ref policy, I contend that there is no single definition of  
"read", or "write" which works for all usages of a given object-class.

The same kind of thing as the r, x, and w above, with occasional  
"type my_type_t; role rr types my_type_t;" to declare a type before  
use.  If you wanted to add support for attributes which apply to  
multiple types, you could put those after a comma after the "type  
my_type_t" portion of the type declaration.

What exactly prevents you from having to "reload" and "relabel the  
filesystem" when using your system?  When you change the meaning of  
new types, you clearly would need to first reload the policy then  
relaunch programs or relabel files to take advantage of the new  
types, otherwise they would be categorically ignored by the system.
The only difference is the "compile" step, which converts from a  
reasonably modifiable language into a binary format which the kernel  
can efficiently parse.  I suspect you'd get shot down instantly if  
you tried to stuff the policy compiler in the kernel too.

Ok, let's say you want to use your model to restrict Apache and MySQL  
running at the same classification level.  You have to define  
combined labels, such as:
   S_Apache   S_MySQL rx
   [...]
Now if you want to run an apache/mysql pair at TS, you have to copy  
all those rules and substitute "S_" with "TS_".  With SELinux, you  
don't have to do anything other than define new labels for the secret- 
web-docs and the top-secret-web-docs folders, because the Apache  
*type-enforcement* policy is completely independent from the MLS  
levels.  You can write a 5-line policy to label 2 slightly different  
initscripts with different range-transitions.  The only difference  
between them will be the paths inside and the labels on them.  The  
rest of apache's policy stays the same.

Unfortunately that's still considered company-proprietary information  
at the moment, although that's likely to change at some point in the  
future.  We're not all that different from the httpd policies and  
similar stuff found in the SELinux "refpolicy" available from tresys'  
website.

How does "moving data around a system" require root privileges?  Why  
should it?  Admittedly, moving data from "TopSecret" to "Secret"  
requires a process labeled with a range including at least "S-TS"  
*and* with the MLS "read-to-clearance" attribute, but you can be as  
stingy with that attribute as you like.  That attribute is explicitly  
given its magic abilities in the mlsconstrain rules defined in the  
policy file itself, so it's also possible to do information flow  
analysis on it.

Here's an argument for why implicit labeling is good and explicit  
labeling is bad:  If your process wants to label things explicitly it  
needs special privileges to do so, and it can abuse those  
privileges.  Under SELinux the labeling is implicit *AND* the  
transitions are entirely within the policy.  This means that you can  
do information flow analysis (as I described above) and it *ALSO*  
means that the program cannot possibly "abuse" its privileges because  
it has none.  When httpd creates a file in its log directory that  
file is created with httpd_log_t and it is limited to being able to  
append to the file *only*.  So when your apache gets compromised, the  
attacker has NO WAY to modify the logs, and you can prove this with a  
60-second study of the policy.  In fact, on my companies productions  
systems I can *PROVE* that the only way to get audit data out of the  
system is via a local TTY by interacting with  
system_u:object_r:local_login_t:SystemLow-SystemHigh to log in with a  
process of someluser:auditreview_r:auditreview_t:SystemHigh, which  
may read the audit files, or  
otherluser:auditadmin_r:auditadmin_t:SystemHigh, which may read and  
delete the audit files.  I can even prove that no process on the  
system is allowed to modify the files after they are created, barring  
a kernel-level vulnerability.
So the implicit labeling of files actually restricts every process  
*FURTHER*.  They no longer have even an inkling of a choice about  
file labeling, and that's a GOOD thing.  The only remaining extension  
we need to really thoroughly lock down our systems is to allow last- 
path-component matching in type-transitions and allow rules (EG:   
When "vipw" creates a file named "passwd" in an "etc_t" directory, it  
is automatically labeled "etc_passwd_t")  From what I understand  
Stephen Smalley and others are thinking that over even now.  I'll do  
it myself as soon as I get time at work beyond prepping systems for  
shipping to clients if they haven't finished it by them.
