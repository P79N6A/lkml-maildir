Just a quick list of Oddities I'm seeing with 2.2.0-pre (have seen these
with all of the patch levels, not counting ac ones.
I am using egcs-1.1.1 release and glibc2, incase it makes any difference
APM: "power off on halt" doesn't work, did in 2.0.x
vesafb: only uses 4096k of video ram, although I have 16mb available, so I
can't do resolutions above 1280x1024x32bit
shutdown: when I shutdown -r (or -h) everything is fine, but the halt, or
reboot commands don't umount / (this seems to have changed with pre6, and it
doesn't get umounted at all)
this is only the oddities I can't see documented anywhere else, I am seeing
more, like my Tulip not working, but I know that's being worked on
