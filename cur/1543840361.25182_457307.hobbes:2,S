The reason the original code is like it is because gcc assumes there
is no wrapping on arithmetic on symbol addresses (it is allowed to assume
that because it is undefined in the C standard). And in same cases wrapping
can happen. There was at least one miscompilation in the past that lead to the 
current construct.
