Subject: kinit problem with cciss root device

kinit converts "root=/dev/cciss/c0d0p1" to "cciss.c0d0", which
doesn't exist under /sys/block because register_disk() converts
"cciss/c0d0" to "cciss!c0d0" (note "!", not ".").
I don't know whether it's the *right* fix, but the patch below
makes things work.  It still doesn't make kinit exactly match
the register_disk() behavior because register_disk() only changes
the first "/" in the string.
This was a nuisance to debug because when it failed, the only
output I got was this:
  ...
  Adding console on ttyS0 at I/O port 0x3f8 (options '115200')
  Time: tsc clocksource has been installed.
  Freeing unused kernel memory: 260k freed
    argc == 4
  Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
    argv[0]: "/ini 
So you might consider something like the "drain output" hunk below,
which allowed all the useful messages to get out.
