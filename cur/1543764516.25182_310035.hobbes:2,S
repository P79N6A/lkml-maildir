Yeah there's been at least one bug on bugzilla open for this, and I
recall the posix specification saying the times on files shall be
updated on mmap file changes (which makes sense too).
Doing it at msync is easy, keeping track of memory mapped data etc. is
more cumbersome. I sent a patch doing this a while ago (doesn't work now
due to msync rework, think it was the 4-level changes) that worked well
for me but nobody seemed to be be overwhelmed by it :-)
