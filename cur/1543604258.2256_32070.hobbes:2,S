Or long lived kernel threads from short lived login sessions.
You have a headless gateway box for your local subnet, administered via ssh 
from a machine on the local subnet.  So you SSH into the box through eth1, 
ifconfig eth0 down back up again.  If eth0 is an rtl8039too, this fires off a 
kernel thread (which, before reparent_to_init, was parented to your ssh login 
session).
Now exit the login session.  SSH does not exit until all the child processes 
exit, so it just hangs there until you kill it from another console window...
