Yes, that seems like a reasonable enough answer for likely()/unlikely()
-- use it only when it's 95% correct, and that way it's sane on all
architectures. The rest we ought to be able to leave to gcc.
To be honest, I'm more interested in the case of get_unaligned(). The
principle is fairly similar -- the ratio between the performance of the
inline and the exception cases varies wildly from architecture to
architecture. But the range is far wider -- we now support architectures
in 2.6 where alignment fixups _cannot_ happen, and the cost of the
'exception' case should be considered infinite.
A probability argument for get_unaligned() allows those architectures to
_unconditionally_ emit inline unaligned load/store code, while allowing
other, saner, architectures to start doing so only when the probability
means it makes sense.
The alternative would be a get_unlikely_unaligned() which does the same
as our current get_unaligned() on architectures without fixups, but
which is a direct dereference on others. I think I'd prefer the
probability approach though, because it allows us to tune the threshold
for all arches.
