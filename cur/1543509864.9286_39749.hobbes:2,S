If it makes you feel any better, I have experienced the same problem.  It 
will also trip you up if you have a large number of files to transfer 
between machines.  Basically, you will lose files randomly, which can be 
pretty tough to track down.  I didn't have time to check it out, so we 
installed Hummingbird NFS (yuk) on the NT box and used good old nfs mount 
as a work around.
This is a pretty serious problem, as you say, and I found it hard to 
believe that no one has fixed it.  Part of the issue might be the official 
Samba team refuses to support smbmount.  This is a real shame, as it could 
be a big advantage for Samba if it worked reliably.
