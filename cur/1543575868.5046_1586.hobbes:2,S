Oh dear this isnt going in is it. 
Look I know the prototype of every single lisp transaction - its a list. Period.
I know how to manipulate any data I have and print it, because its a list.
I know how to extend it, because its .. a list.
If I need to put content identification in, well guess what - thats a list
	((my_name "Hello") (his_name "Foo"))
and XML is simply lisp done wrong.
