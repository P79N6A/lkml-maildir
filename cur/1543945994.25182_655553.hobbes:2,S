Yikes,
The control type feature documentation needs to go away and Li has a patch for
it, so I'll not touch that part. Here's the updated patch. Thanks for catching
this Andreas.
The memory controller has a requirement that while writing values, we need
to use echo -n. This patch fixes the problem and makes the UI more consistent.
