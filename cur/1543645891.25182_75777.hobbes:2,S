Sure.  If a pte page is shared, the mm->page_table_lock is not sufficient
to protect the rest of the page fault.  Therefore we need a lock at the pte
page level.  The mm->page_table_lock is held during the page fault until we
have a valid and locked pte page we're working on, then it's dropped for
the rest of the fault.
Feel free to poke holes in my logic, but I think it's the right locking
model for shared pte pages.
