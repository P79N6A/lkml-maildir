There was a reset early on, but it was before the majority of errors.
Here is the begining of problem:
May 13 16:38:14 cthulhu hdc: DMA interrupt recovery
May 13 16:38:14 cthulhu hdc: lost interrupt
May 13 16:38:14 cthulhu hdc: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
May 13 16:38:14 cthulhu hdc: status timeout: error=0x00
May 13 16:38:14 cthulhu hdc: DMA disabled
May 13 16:38:14 cthulhu hdc: drive not ready for command
May 13 16:38:15 cthulhu hdc: ATAPI reset complete
May 13 16:38:15 cthulhu cdrom_pc_intr, write: dev hdc: flags = REQ_STARTED REQ_PC
May 13 16:38:15 cthulhu sector 0, nr/cnr 0/0
May 13 16:38:15 cthulhu bio 00000000, biotail 00000000, buffer 00000000, data 00000000, len 0

May 13 16:39:15 cthulhu ide-cd: cmd 0x1e timed out

There are an additional 700K of errors like this before I finally
