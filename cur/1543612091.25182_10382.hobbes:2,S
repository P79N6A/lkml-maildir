What may cause an AudioCD no being recocognized at first attempt but
only after unloading/reloading the modules ide-cd cdrom ?
I'm testing 2.5.1-pre5 + devfs-patch-v202.
My CRD-8240B is known as /dev/cdroms/cdrom0 in fstab, to mount it
manually on /cdrom, and in the gnome CD player gtcd preferences panel.
ide-cd and cdrom are loaded at boot time (i don't need that, 2.4.16 does
it as well). After loging in i can mount /cdrom but if it is an AudioCD
gtcd tells me 'no disc'.
After rmmod ide-cd cdrom, gtcd finds the AudioCD OK.
This doesn't happen on plain 2.4.16
