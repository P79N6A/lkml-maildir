:) I've read that in other lists it's impolite to CC others.  I still do
it :}  I find that, espically if I'm on lots of lists, if I'm on a thread,
I prefer to be emailed directly, that way I know about a topic that I
might need to quickly respond to.  I never pay attention to policies
abount stripping CC lists, because I don't ever want to be stripped from a
thread I'm interested in.  The LKML has 300 to 700 emails a day, so you
really do need to CC those, otherwise you'll be lost in the noise.

OK, now you got my attention.  What do you mean by your machine stops?
Are you playing with priorities?  You might want to turn on latency
tracing, although it could be a PI leak.  But I really need to know more,
since I'm suspecting that your app isn't written properly to work with a
true RT environment.
RT means that you can easily freeze the machine if you have a high prio
task that runs more than you expect it to.  With this power comes great
responsibility, as well as understanding.
Is this SMP or UP?
Could you explain you app a little and what tasks are RT?
Thanks,
