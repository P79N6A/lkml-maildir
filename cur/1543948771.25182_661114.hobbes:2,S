Hmm. As far as I can tell, its actually using the vm86old system call?
That's at least what the comment in libx86 states.
However the contents of struct vm86_struct after the segfault is:
(gdb) print context.vm
$2 = {regs = {ebx = 0, ecx = 0, edx = 0, esi = 0, edi = 0, ebp = 0, 
    eax = 20227, __null_ds = 0, __null_es = 0, __null_fs = -1071579136, 
    __null_gs = 0, orig_eax = -1, eip = 6326, cs = 49152, __csh = 0, 
    eflags = 209410, esp = 4090, ss = 256, __ssh = 0, es = 0, __esh = 0, 
    ds = 64, __dsh = 0, fs = 0, __fsh = 0, gs = 0, __gsh = 0}, flags = 0, 
  screen_bitmap = 0, cpu_type = 0, int_revectored = {__map = {0, 0, 0,0, 0, 
      0, 0, 2147483648}}, int21_revectored = {__map = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
      0}}}
My version of glibc does not seem to have vm86old declared, so I haven't
tried to remove the assembly code.
Should I try to change it to use vm86, instead of vm86old?
