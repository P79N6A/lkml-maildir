The ctor/dtor are only called when new objects are created, not on every 
kmem_cache_alloc/kmem_cache_free. Thus I would expect that the counter 
becomes negative on builds without CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB.
Thus increase in the ctor and decrease in file_free() is the wrong 
thing. If you want to move the decrease from the dtor to file_free, then 
you must move the increase, too.
But: IIRC the counters were moved to the ctor/dtor for performance 
reasons, I'd guess mbligh ran into cache line trashing on the 
filp_count_lock spinlock with reaim or something like that.
