	Rather than this (returning nothing if not in xor or 802.3ad
mode), I'd prefer to see this always return whatever the xmit policy is
(regardless of the mode), and remove the mode test from
bonding_store_xmit_hash().
	This would be consistent with the way the arp_ip_target option
is treated: the actual value is always displayed, even if it is not
used, and it is legal to change the value, regardless of the mode.
	Other than this, I'm fine with the changes.
