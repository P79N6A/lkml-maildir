Sure.  I know that systemtap (
http://sourceware.org/systemtap/
) is
using relayfs and that LTT (
http://www.opersys.com/ltt/index.html
) is
also currently being reworked to use it.
I've also added a couple of people to the cc: list that I've consulted
with in getting their applications to use relayfs, one of which is the
logdev debugging device recently posted to LKML.
I also know that there are still users of the old relayfs around; I
don't however know what their plans are regarding moving to the new
relayfs.
My own personal interest is to start playing around with creating some
visualization tools using data gathered from relayfs.  Hopefully, I'll
have more time to do that if relayfs gets merged. ;-)
Hope that helps,
Tom
