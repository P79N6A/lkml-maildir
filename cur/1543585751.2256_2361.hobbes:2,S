What do people think of my "adjustments" to the existing algorithm?  Mostly
it gives extra longevity to low-UID and long-running processes, which to my
mind makes sense for both server and desktop boxen.
Taking for example an 80Mb process under my adjustments, it is reduced to
under the badness of a new shell process after less than a week's uptime
(compared to several months), especially if it is run as low-UID.  Small,
short-lived interactive processes still don't get *too* adversely affected,
but a memory hog with only a few hours' uptime will still get killed with
high probability (pretty much what we want).
I didn't quite understand Martin's comments about "not normalised" -
presumably this is some mathematical argument, but what does this actually
mean?
