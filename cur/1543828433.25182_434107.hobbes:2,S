That did not help.  I have 1 minute outputs from tcpdump under both 2.6.11.12 
and 2.6.16.20.  You will see a large size difference between the files.  Since 
the 2.6.11.12 one is 2 MBytes, I thought I would post them via the web instead 
of via attachments.   Look at:
http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~harry/linux/2.6.11.12.out.1min
http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~harry/linux/2.6.16.20.out.1min
And again, thank to all of you for looking into this.
