Unilaterally following the standard is all well and good
for those who know how to get around it when a site becomes
inaccessible, but not for Joe User.
If it always fails, or always works, that's not such a big problem.
I would never have complained if I had never been able to access
the web sites in question.  But since it IS working in 2.6.16,
and got broken in 2.6.17, I'm bloody well going to complain.
I suppose the most important objection to our current behaviour
is that this behaviour *changes* when something totally unrelated
(to Joe User) happens:  adding or removing a stick of RAM.
So I'm not against the window scaling, just against it's apparent
randomness (to the vast majority who are not "in the know").
We should perhaps just have a fixed upper memory setting, as we
currently do in 2.6.16, so that the behaviour is predictable.
On a related note.. I wonder if we can choose better values for
the window size, so that if the scale factor is ignored, we still
end up with reasonably sized packets?  So that the other box
will not think our window is a mere "94" when the scale factor
is lost?
