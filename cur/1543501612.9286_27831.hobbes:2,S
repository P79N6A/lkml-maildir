     Not to belabor the obvious, but yours isn't the only equipment rack
     in the world.   In *my* experience, once I've put 3-4 machines into
     a rack, plus the necessary networking plumbing to make them into a
     backbone, it's close enough to spaghetti to confuse the most
     discerning gourmand.
     Your racks, which I'm sure each contain 30 or 40 machines, may be
     an neat and tidy as pins.  Celebrate.  But it's foolish to assume
     that everyone else is as fortunate as you.

    So what?    On the recieving end, the little UDP reader will
    pre-parse the panic packet into a form that's readable by ksymoops,
    so when the dead carcass is brought back to live you can dredge a
    symbol table off it and build a good bug report.  It would be a
    lot easier than dragging in serial plumbing for every machine that
    might possibly fail.

    Heavens, the nerve of some people, asking on the kernel mailing
    list if the infrastructure exists to get bug reports out of
    failing machines so that bugs can be reported.

                   \/                "the system mysteriously crashed"
