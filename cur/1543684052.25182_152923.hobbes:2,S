so if it was really the itimer, it had to be on ppc s390 or ia64, not on
x86.  I never reproduced this myself. I will ask more info on bugzilla,
because I thought it was x86 but maybe it wasn't. As said in the
previous email, only non x86 archs can run the timer irq on a cpu
different than the one where it was inserted.
As Andrew, noted the same race could happen in 2.6 with add_timer_on.
But apparently you're right that the setitimer couldn't trigger on 2.6
or 2.4-aa x86.
Still it could be something else that broke related to
add_timer/del_timer_sync in drivers reproducible in x86 too. As said I
didn't debug or reproduce it myself. It simply looked correct to allow
add_timer to run in parallel of del_timer_sync (no matter which cpu
they're running on, if add_timer runs from inside the timer itself, of
course it can't trigger because the base won't change in add_timer and
del_timer will be a reader falling in the same base, but that's a kind
of special case, and it fails too if you use add_timer_on).
