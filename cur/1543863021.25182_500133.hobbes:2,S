right, and that last part explains that snippet i previously posted
from include/asm-alpha/compiler.h
========================
#ifdef __KERNEL__
/* Some idiots over in <linux/compiler.h> thought inline should imply
   always_inline.  This breaks stuff.  We'll include this file whenever
   we run into such problems.  */
========================
  which is a result of this from include/linux/compiler.h:
========================
#define inline          inline          __attribute__((always_inline))
#define __inline__      __inline__      __attribute__((always_inline))
#define __inline        __inline        __attribute__((always_inline))
which certainly seems to suggest that *ever* explicitly stating
"always inline" is redundant, no?  maybe i'm missing something
critical here but this just seems wrong.

and that makes sense.  it has no effect, it's more for just
commenting.  but it's still kind of misleading.
