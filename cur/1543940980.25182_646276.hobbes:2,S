Why do you want to add a new API?
    addr = ioremap(phys_addr, len);
    set_memory_x(addr);
should do what you want already. I think Arjan was not very clear in
his reply yesterday.
We tried to avoid the intermingling of ioremap and the page attribute
settings. We just kept the cached/uncached part.
Now thinking about it further, we should probably fully decouple the
mapping and the attribute change and remove the enum argument from
__ioremap and change the implementations of ioremap_cached and
ioremap_uncached to do the attribute setting after the remap. 
That way ioremap_chached and ioremap_uncached just would become what
they should be: conveniance functions for the developers.
Thanks,
