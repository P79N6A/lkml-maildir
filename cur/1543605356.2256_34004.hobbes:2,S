The use I can see for tree quotas whould be quite divorced from
accounts or users. Currently if you want limit the amount of
space the say /tmp, /home or /var/mail uses you need to put
it on a separate partition, but if you could put a quota 
on a tree you'd have a much more flexible systema adminstration
tool to control the disk space used by each particular function.
I quite like the idea of the quota being related to an inode.
