Ubuntu 8.10 comes with a 2.6.27 kernel as packaged by Ubuntu.

The stock Ubuntu install includes vesafb support, but Alejandro's dmesg
doesn't indicate that he's using vesafb at all.  The NVIDIA kernel
module refuses to work with the nvidiafb driver (claiming a conflict)
so if the NVIDIA module loads, nvidiafb isn't present.  (In fact, the
NVIDIA kernel module linkage will refuse to build against a kernel that
was even configured for nvidiafb).
I'm using 2.6.28-rc7 successfully on Ubuntu with the NVIDIA kernel
module as packaged by Ubuntu (Ubuntu 8.10 uses DKMS to manage the
module).  A single change to the linkage's C code was necessary, and
it is also necessary to either instruct the linkage where to find
relocated kernel headers or to create some symlinks:
 $ cd /lib/modules/2.6.28-rc7/source/include/asm-x86
 $ ln -s ../../arch/x86/include/asm/* .
(This may be different for a 32-bit configuration; mine is a 64-bit
x86-64 kernel.  I don't think it is different, though.)  I have it
working both using the standard 80x25 VGA console and with the vesafb
driver providing a significantly larger console.

NVIDIA still does mode setting in X.org, by default detecting the
native resolution of the attached monitor and using that.
This doesn't affect the VGA console... however, I have run into
NVIDIA-based graphics boards that don't like mode changes very much.
Some of the really finicky cards require using vesafb in the kernel and
then telling X.org to use the kernel-provided framebuffer to get it to
work correctly.
Also, the VESA X.org driver doesn't play nicely with all NVIDIA
boards; this might explain why the system didn't switch cleanly to a VT
after starting in "safe mode" --- which is Ubuntu's way of saying,
"640x480 using the vesa X.org driver".
Alejandro, can you switch back to VTs again after rebuilding your
NVIDIA module?  Also, you seem to have mentioned that you're not using
Ubuntu's packaged NVIDIA driver... this may mean that you've
overwritten and/or moved other files that Ubuntu uses, since the NVIDIA
driver installer does this automatically.  Can you try using a stock
system, updated kernel, and let DKMS build the NVIDIA module?  You'll
need to make some alterations, but I can help with those.
	HTH,
	Mike
