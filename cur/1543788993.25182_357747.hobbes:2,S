	I'm still here and still responding to mhw@wittsend.com.  You may have
gotten caught up in a spam filter.  IAC...  I don't recall getting any
messages.  I have had contact with others on that address and I posted
to LKML back early this year that I was still alive after Andrew Morton
chimed in that I was still around and WittsEnd was still around.

	You're not on a black list but CRM-114 may have caught you anyways.
	I spoke with Andrew about the Computone driver when we were both
speaking at Linux Lunacy last week.  I still intend to maintain it an
I've been working on the 2.6 driver.  I've got a spinlock problem that
has me in a bind at the moment with the patches.  I jokingly told Andrew
that he would get the patch as soon as I shot this problem and I was not
going to be like some people who sends him patches that don't even
compile.  :-)
	I thought the PCI stuff was there.  I'll look that over and see what
needs to be done.  Got some pointers to docs on what I need to update
for that?  I was talking to Andrew about the spinlock problems but he
didn't say anything about PCI probing.  What's missing?
