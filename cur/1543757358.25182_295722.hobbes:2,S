The goal is to know what to tell the system vendors
interested in supporting Linux what they should do
with their BIOS on future platforms.
I believe our message should be:
1. BIOS should save/restore video in S3
2. Use Intel's ACPICA ASL compiler -- if not for production,
then at least as a static source code checker for validation.
thanks,
