Please give a concrete example of a failure mode where this allows
you to meet your timing constraint.
I have yet to be convinced that this actually solves a real world
problem.
What is the cost of the notifier you wish to implement?
What is your guarantee that the system won't have wasted seconds
detecting it can't allocate memory or other cases?
If we go this route the notifier should not be exported to modules.
Only the most scrutinized of code paths should ever set this,
and code like that should never be a module.
The patchset that adds the notifier call needs to include the notifier
so people can look and see how sane this is.
So far what I have seen are hand waving arguments that failures
that can never happen must be detected and reported within
milliseconds to another machine in an unspecified manner.  Your kernel
startup times are asserted to be to large to do this from the next
kernel, but the code to do so is sufficiently complicated you can't do
this in the kexec code stub that runs before it starts your next
kernel.
I am sympathetic but this interface seems to set expectations that
we can the impossible, and it still appears unnecessary to me.
