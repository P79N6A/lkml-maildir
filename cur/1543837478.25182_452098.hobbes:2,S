Dear All:
We had some patch need to submit. Would you tell me where to get current
sundance.c for myself to generate those patch files.
Sorry, I only got this link:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;h=f13b2a195c708fe32d8c53d05988875a51bd52e1;hb=1668b19f75cb949f930814a23b74201ad6f76a53;f=drivers/net/sundance.c
Thanks for everybody.
Best Regards,
Jesse Huang

You do not need to do anything:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=1668b19f75cb949f930814a23b74201ad6f76a53
As far as I have checked before forwarding Pedro Alejandro's patch, the
out-of-tree IP100 driver exhibited no significant difference with the
sundance driver.
