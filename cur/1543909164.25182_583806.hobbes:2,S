Since somebody is going to screw up and do it - what are the semantics of
'drivers/net' and forgetting the trailing slash?  Does your tool break on
that, and if so, is it silent or noisy (if it's silent, it won't get fixed).
> +	F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
Does the leading '*' match exactly one level, or will it match foo/bar/net/*
as well?
Is a construction like 'net/*/netfilter/*' legal?
