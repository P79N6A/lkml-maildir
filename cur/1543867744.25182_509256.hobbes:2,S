Well one way you could cast it and still have the compiler tell you if
the type ever changes is doing something stupid like:
char* unsigned_char_star_to_char_star(unsigned char* in) {
	return (char*)in;
}
Then call your strlen with:
strlen(unsigned_char_star_to_char_star(my_unfortunate_unsigned_char_string)
If you ever changed the type the compiler would warn you again since the
convertion function doesn't accept anything other than unsigned char *
being passed in for "convertion".  Seems safer than a direct cast since
then you get no type checking anymore.
I hope it doesn't come to this though.  Hopefully gcc will change it's
behaviour back or give an option of --dontcomplainaboutcharstar :)
