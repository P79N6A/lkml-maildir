Subject: [PATCH] ACPI oops with 2.5.8-pre3 on asus dual athlon (A7M266-D)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  Null pointer dereference in some deep internal ACPI state thing.
Attached patch gets it past that point, but kernel then hangs after
probing disks (as did -pre2, and possibly earlier ones). Almost
certainly not the right fix :)
