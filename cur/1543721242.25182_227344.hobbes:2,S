Looking at these numastat results and the default policy it seems that
memory is primarily allocated on the first node which in turn means a
unnecessarily large amount of page faults on the second node.
I wonder if it is possible to better balance processes among the nodes
by e.g. setting nodeAffinity = pid mod nodeCount

attempting to represent seven dimensions in four dimensional reality.
