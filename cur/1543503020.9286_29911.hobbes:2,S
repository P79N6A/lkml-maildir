Correct.

Yes.  This is exactly what you'd want to optimise MAP_SEQUENTIAL maps.

Not quite.  We don't trigger the cluster readaround unless the page is
missing from the cache altogether.  For sequential accesses, we
basically guarantee that all accesses to the rest of the cluster are in
cache once the first page fault in the cluster has been taken.  The IO
may not be complete yet, but the cache data structures will be in place.
In other words, the clustering readaround will trigger a readbehind for
sequential accesses.
