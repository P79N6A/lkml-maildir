Hi there.
I have to admit to being puzzled here, so hopefully somebody can
straighten me out...
First, what system. Well, it's a 486dx4/75 based Toshiba T2110 notepad
computer, 12M of RAM, and just upgraded to a 4.3G hard drive. There
are two PCMCIA slots, both occupied as follows:
 Q> Slot 0 = 10M Ethernet adapter.
 Q> Slot 1 = V90 Modem adapter.
RedHat 5.2 was NFS installed on the system, along with the updates to
kernel*-2.0.36-3.i386.rpm and that works fine. Also, as long as I stay
with the kernel as it comes in those rpm's, networking and the modem
work fine.
However, the kernel as supplied does NOT include APM support, and on
this notepad computer, I need that - and that's where the problems
arise: If I compile my own kernel from kernel-source-2.0.36-3.i386.rpm
after doing "make menuconfig" and enabling APM, the PCMCIA subsystem
stops working !!!!!!!
Basically, I appear to have two options, neither of which comes near
to being satiisfactory:
 1. Run with the PCMCIA subsystem but without APM.
 2. Run with APM but without the PCMCIA subsystem.
Anybody - PLEASE - tell me what I'm doing wrong!!!
Best wishes from Riley.
