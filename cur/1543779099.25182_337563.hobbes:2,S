Vesafb defaults to write-combining mtrr.  But the memory range is already
set to write-back so mtrr_check() spewed the above messages. I don't think it
has any ill effects, but if you want to eliminate the above messages, tell
vesafb to also use write-back mtrr by adding the boot option "mtrr:2"
(or nomtrr).
I think I'll submit a documentation patch.
