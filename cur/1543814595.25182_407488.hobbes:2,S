... and still using that 2.6.16-rc5 with the suggested patch,
during the last 11 days, always doing a lot of number-crunching with
Gaussian and other programs, we had no more oom-killings or other
noticeable instabilities.
I did take the opportunity to configure the kernel with CONFIG_EDAC,
CONFIG_EDAC_MM_EDAC and CONFIG_EDAC_E752X, and during this period (11
days) got about 20 messages like these:
Mar  7 15:25:08 localhost kernel: [182069.699544] Non-Fatal Error DRAM
Controler
Mar  7 15:25:08 localhost kernel: [182069.699559] EDAC MC0: CE page
0x9c334, offset 0x0, grain 4096, syndrome 0x2510, row 2, channel 1,
label "": e752x CE
always with the same values for page, offset, grain, syndrome, row, and
channel values.  A defective DIMM?
