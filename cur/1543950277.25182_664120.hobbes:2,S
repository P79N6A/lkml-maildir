Hi!
Is headers_install a valid make target? Somone on the kernel irc said it
was true, however when I run "make headers_install":
make: *** No rule to make target `headers_install'.  Stop.
object/goal: I am attempting to install the includes and set up the asm
links (and whatnot), which is one step in a procedure to build a
cross-compile toolchain.
cheers,
az
