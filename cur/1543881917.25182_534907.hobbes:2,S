There are two completely different points:
- I say that the feature STD has use cases where STR is not a replacement
- you say you dislike the current implementation of STD
For me it was a serious regression if STD was removed without any 
replacement.
If someone would replace the STD implementation with what you want it to 
be I wouldn't care and you were happy.
