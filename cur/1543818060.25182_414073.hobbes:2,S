Subject: [PATCH] Futher fix memory barrier docs wrt atomic ops
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Further fix the memory barrier documents to portray bitwise operation memory
barrier effects correctly following Nick Piggin's comments.
It makes the point that any atomic op that both modifies some state in memory
and returns information on that state implies memory barriers on both sides.
This patch depends on:

 Basically, each usage case has to be carefully considered as to whether memory
-barriers are needed or not.  The simplest rule is probably: if the atomic

 [!] Note that special memory barrier primitives are available for these
 situations because on some CPUs the atomic instructions used imply full memory
