Yes.

No we want a single tfm for this.
If we ever get hardware that can handle only one of the two
operations we can always implement software fallbacks as we
do for hashing and encryption.

Yes but LZO has exactly one user (ubifs) in the kernel and it can
stick to the current interface until we convert it over.  It's
just not worth the extra work to help a single user.
