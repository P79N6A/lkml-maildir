Subject: [PATCH][kconfig][i386] Fix help entry for processor type choice
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

  Hello,
  this patch (against 2.5.64) moves the generic help of the "Processor family"
choice from the CONFIG_M386 option, adding some specific information about i386
processors to it instead.
  Please consider applying.
