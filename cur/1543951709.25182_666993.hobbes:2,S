No, they're with it turned on (and still on w/this change where it doesn't 
panic). If I run with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n, no panic.

D'oh, got overzealous reading dma docs, missed the fact that we didn't 
actually touch it on the host side, so nothing to actually sync...

...but got lucky in that it actually helps this particular setup (x86_64 
kernel, dual quad-core opteron, 8G RAM, 3 FireWire controllers). Hrm.

More investigative fun for tomorrow...

Seems both of the ones that looked like slab poison were on PowerPC. I'll have 
to spin up a ppc kernel on the old powerbook and poke around more.
