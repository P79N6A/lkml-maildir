Not broken in 2.4, although the 2.4-ac kernel uses movntq instead for
Athlon as it is faster than mmx_memcpy, which we use for Cyrix/VIA/IDT
processors where it is a win.

And what about all the pre MP/XP ones, lots of those.

My AMD docs list it as part of the AMD extended 3dnow. The original
3dnow as done by AMD/Cyrix does not have it

"Mummy it doesnt work like I personally have decreed it shall lets break
it and screw all the users". Thats the Dan Bernstein school of charm
theory of software development.

3dnowext is what we want here. It might end up doing a prefetchw on
K6 but at least K6 actually has the instruction...

We want a pseudobit - otherwise we'll break other code that checks
3dnow is present properly.

prefetching is a big win on older Athlon because the CPU is fast and the
chipset/ram sucks hugely relative to it

If you misalign the instruction you don't seem to get the exception on
Athlon, dunno about the Opteron errata or if the opteron errata bites in
32bit. If it does I guess we should clear mmx, xmm for Opteron by your
arguments ;)
