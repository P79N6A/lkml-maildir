Thanks Andrew, for including the vfat speedup patch.
It has really improved a lot the performance of access to directories
having many subdirectories in an external Firewire HD that I have.
I'd say that if others don't have problems with it, then it should be
in 2.6.13, as far as I am concerned.
BTW, everything is working fine with the sbp2/ieee1394 drivers that
are in the mm tree.
It seems that there are some issues with ALSA, though. I will report
back as soon as I see if these are userland problems or not (it worked
fine with vanilla 2.6.13-rc5).
Thanks, Rogério.
