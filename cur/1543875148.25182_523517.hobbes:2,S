The problem has been identified as the known issue related to the XFS freezable
workqueues.  There is a patch available (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/21/328
),
that has been merged.
Still, there is a problem with the microcode update driver that's being worked
on.
The reporters of the resume problems who use the microcode driver, please
check if the problems go away if you unload the driver before the suspend.
Greetings,
Rafael
