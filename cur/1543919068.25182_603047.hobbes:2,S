All changes are licensed under the terms of the file modified. 
(Some people seem not to understand that
if the file is dual licensed, then the changes are dual licensed. 
If file is GPL v2 only, then the changes are GPL v2 only, ...)

IMHO the other tags actually are a poor substitute for providing a
more complete description of the reviewer's involvement. It would be better
to have more complete responses like "the patch should be merged as is for
2.6.X but the following should be fixed, ..." etc. The certificate of origin
has meaning for legal things that have a more concrete definition, but the
existing process is about people making good (or bad) decisions based on
feedback and other data. Trying to reduce the feedback down to 3 Acks, and 1 Review
seems like noise. The problem is getting good reviews of new code in
a timely manner, not the descriptions of the result.
