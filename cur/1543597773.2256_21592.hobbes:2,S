Very true, although I get the feeling that the 2.2. series was far more
'stable' than the current 2.4 series. Just a feeling, but .... 
What you're saying seems to apply more to a 2.<odd> kernel series, IMHO ?
I haven't done this myself, but perhaps we ought to look at the frequency
of new 2.4 releases compared to new 2.2 releases. Shouldn't their frequency
be roughly equal ? ie. the speed with which we're seeing new 2.4 releases 
should be - roughly - that of which we saw new 2.2 kernels emerging ?
comments ?
