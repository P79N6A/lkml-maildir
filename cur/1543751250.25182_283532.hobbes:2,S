I'm not entirely convinced. In Rik's case it didn't matter, because
all his writeout was in the same zone that reclaim was happening
against (ZONE_NORMAL), so in that case, PG_writeback throttling
will do exactly the same thing as blk_congestion_wait.
I do like your PG_writeback throttling idea for the other reason
that it should behave better on NUMA systems with lots of zones
and lots of disks.

Well I think you do need *something*. If you wake up each time a
single page (or request) has completed, you only complete what,
12 (DEF_PRIORITY) requests before going OOM? In the worst possible
case scenario, which looks like what Rik's running into.
