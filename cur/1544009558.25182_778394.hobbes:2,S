Weird. My laptop has the same device and I've successfully installed 
Debian to it [1]...
02:06.2 SD Host controller [0805]: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C822 
SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPro Host Adapter [1180:0822] (rev 21)
        Kernel driver in use: sdhci-pci
        Kernel modules: sdhci-pci
02:06.3 System peripheral [0880]: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C843 MMC Host Controller 
[1180:0843] (rev ff)
        Kernel driver in use: ricoh-mmc
        Kernel modules: ricoh_mmc
The function of the ricoh_mmc module is to disable the last (proprietary) 
controller in favor of the first (generic) one.
Cheers,
FJP
