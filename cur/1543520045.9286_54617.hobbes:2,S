When I test kernels and I want to make a boot floppy, I use this script:
---------- cut -------------
#!/bin/sh
#
# Created 21-JAN-1995  Richard B. Johnson
#
cp /usr/src/linux/System.map /
cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage /tmp/vmlinux
ROOTDEV=`df / | cut -d ' ' -f1 | sed -e1d`
echo -n 'Setting root device as ' ; echo ${ROOTDEV}
rdev -R /tmp/vmlinux 1
rdev /tmp/vmlinux ${ROOTDEV}
cp /tmp/vmlinux /dev/fd0
rm -f /tmp/vmlinux
psupdate
----------- cut ---------------
The first `rdev` command tells the kernel to mount root r/o to start.
The second `rdev` command tells the kernel the root file-system to mount.
Then the modified compressed image is just copied to what will be
the boot-floppy (Drive A:) on startup.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
