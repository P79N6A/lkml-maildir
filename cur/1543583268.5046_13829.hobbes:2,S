I always do it by a BASIC programme under DOS (yep I know
this isn't pure but I have a font editor from S-DOS aka
PTS-DOS (the free version)). The SFE.COM allows me to design
8x8 8x12 8x14 8x16 fonts; the unicode table I write in the
MC or VC (NC clone for DOS) editor; my BASIC pgm converts
them together to PSFU. It's very easy once you read the psf
docs.
It's a pity that I've to mkfs the DOS partitions of my HDDs
every handfull of weeks, otherwise I'd put them onto a ftp
server somewhere. But I call you to try it by yourself.
(perl prolly isn't that easy coz it goes to binary values,
but GW-BASIC is fine)
