Umm... If queue is too busy, we can't flush immediately. So, this code
is delaying flush, and we can wait the more user's request by it, I think.

Yes, but probably we need to change handling of bd_inode (sb->s_bdev).
The buffer_heads seems to be synced via block_super. And DQUOT_SYNC(sb)
may be needed.
I think it will need big change (and cleanup) after all. (That's no
problem itself I think, but, I would need to make more time)

I'm still doing it in the following. I thought the other filesystems
may select other flushing strategy on ->release(), so I didn't do it in VFS.
