How is that better for people complaining that everything needs to be
swapped in in the morning?
Suspend-to-disk will cause everything to be paged in too.  Faster I
suspect (haven't tried it; it doesn't work on my box), but still a
wait especially when you add in the BIOS boot time.
Environmentally turning an unused machine off is good.  But I don't
see how suspend-to-disk will convince people who are annoyed by
swapping in the morning.

If nothing at all happens, does it matter that pages are written to
swap?  They're still in RAM as well.
