Seems like a pretty obscure case to optimize for.
Anyways if you want to do that you can always do
disable_preempt(); 
set thread affinity mask to current cpu
enable_preempt(); 
do weird stuff and sleep ...  ;
restore affinity mask
Can any of these people proposing "solutions" in this thread
demonstrate this stuff is actually performance critical?
