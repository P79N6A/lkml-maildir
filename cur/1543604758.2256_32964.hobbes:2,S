Actually, this is a normal state of affairs for !i386.  PPC has actually
been around in some form or another for 5 years almost... (at least?).
m68k is older than that.  It's sort of a given that the Linus tree will
be a bit behind.  But as far as PPC goes, we were actually pretty close
in 2.4.10 and 2.4.12 and the stable PPC tree had very few (and for the
most part unimportant) differences.
