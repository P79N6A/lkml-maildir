OK, in this case, it didn't sound like your block driver
expected to be re-entered. Lucky the problem immediately
caused a deadlock ;)
More seriously, lets say you get around the above with
recursive locks:
Thread 1			Thread 2 (on another cpu)
enter the block driver
take the bd lock
				issue an md ioctl
				take the md lock
				enter the block driver
				spin on bd lock
automatically call md ioctl
spin on md lock
So the problem needs a rethink.
