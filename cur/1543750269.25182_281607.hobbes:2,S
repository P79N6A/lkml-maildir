I have a somewhat similar case here, samba processses are unkillable, 
but I can do a software reboot. Something is also killing amandad, 
and I lost the backup of this machine last night.  The amanda logs 
are bereft of any info and I've no clue that its happened except a 
message from amanda that the client access timed out on this machine.
This was while running 2.6.10-rc3-mm1-V0.33-04 which ran stably for 8 
days previously.
