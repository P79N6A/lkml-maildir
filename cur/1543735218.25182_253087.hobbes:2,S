  As I understand the patch it won't have any nontrivial memory
footprint in case you won't use inotify. Only in case someone wants to
watch inode, appropriate structure is allocated, inode pined etc. The
numbers above are in the case you watch maximum possible number of
inodes etc...
  Maybe you should not be so fast in using your flamethrower;)
