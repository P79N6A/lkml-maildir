Your expectations are not based upon any logic, only wishes.

To make your wishes come true execute:
     echo "1" >/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
... as a super-user.
That will make malloc() fail when there isn't any more virtual
memory.
An even shorter program...
main ()
{
     for(;;)
         *(long *)malloc(0x0010000) = 1;
}
This will seg-fault because malloc will eventually return NULL and,
yawn, nothing except your program gets killed.
