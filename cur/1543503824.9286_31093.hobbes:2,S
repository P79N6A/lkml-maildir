I'm certainly interested in this, and I have a few ideas here. Most
importantly, what I want is efficient read/write of multiple files
"simultaneously" (needs HUGE buffers), and a mechanism for telling the
read-ahead what to do.
Reading files backwards is also useful... (Means that the read-ahead
system needs to be aware of that kind of tricks. BTW, I'm not suggesting
reversing on the data level! I'm thinking buffers; size set when opening
would do.)
I'd be interested in helping with design and hacking, as I'll need the
stuff sooner or later anyway. What I want from a multi-file streaming
system is relieveing the application developer of the complex task of
figuring out how to handle mutiple streams from disk without stressing
the disk to death. Big issue in audio recording; might be useful for
heavy data aquisition as well...
