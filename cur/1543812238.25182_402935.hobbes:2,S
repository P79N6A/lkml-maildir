Subject: [PATCH 0/9] PNP: adjust pnp_register_driver signature
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This series of patches removes the assumption that pnp_register_driver()
returns the number of devices claimed.  Returning the count is unreliable
because devices may be hot-plugged in the future.  (Many devices don't
support hot-plug, of course, but PNP in general does.)
This changes the convention to "zero for success, or a negative error
value," which matches pci_register_driver(), acpi_bus_register_driver(),
and platform_driver_register().
If drivers need to know the number of devices, they can count calls
to their .probe() methods.
