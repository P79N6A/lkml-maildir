What's worse; look at the stack usage on that sucker alone:
10 pointers, 6 u8, 2 u16, 2 u32, and topped off with 3 unknown-sized  
"struct ipz_cq_handle", an unknown-sized "struct ipz_pd".  The  
alignment alone probably chews up at least another couple bytes in  
there somewhere too.  That's at _least_ 98 + 3*sizeof(struct  
ipz_cq_handle) + sizeof(struct ipz_pd) on a 64-bit platform (58 +  
3*sizeof(struct ipz_cq_handle) + sizeof(struct ipz_pd) on 32-bit).   
Not to mention the fact that you totally screwed the compiler's  
chances of ever passing the important stuff in registers.  And you  
haven't even gotten into local variables yet.
