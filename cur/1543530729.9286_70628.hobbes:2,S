There's no need to change asm-*/mman.h since that header is not used
by glibc.
So far I haven't added them to glibc - and will not.  AFAIU those
flags are defined - but not used at all.  That's the reason why I'm
not adding them (yet) to glibc.  But I'd like to point this out so
that people can consider implementing MADV_SPACEAVAIL and MADV_FREE
- and only if it's implemented it should be added to glibc.
