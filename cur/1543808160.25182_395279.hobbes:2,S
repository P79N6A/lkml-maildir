Subject: [RFC:PATCH(000/003)] Memory add to onlined node. (ver. 2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello.
I updated patches for memory hot-add.
Current code allow addition to just node 0.
By this patch, the new memory is able to be added to appropriate node,
- if the node is already online.-  If the node is offline, 
(It means new node is comming!)  then the memory will belongs
to node 0 yet.
If new memory belongs to new node, new pgdat must be initialized.
But, it still need more many steps. So, I would like to propose
this small steps for a while.
This patch is use acpi's DSDT to find node id from physicall address.
So, this patch is just for intel/AMD architecture.
I tested this patch on ia64 and x86-64 box with custermized  SRAT & DSDT
node emulation.
This patch is for 2.6.16-rc2-mm1. 
Please comment.
Change log from ver.1 is
  - The parameter of size of add_memory() was changed from (_MAX - _MIN + 1)
    to _LEN by Bjorn Helgaas-san.
    To compare physical memory and DSDT at
    acpi_memory_match_paddr_to_memdevice(), using MAX-MIN +1 was changed 
    to using length.
  - change from using acpi_map_pxm_to_node() to pxm_to_node().
    acpi_map_pxm_to_node() is useful to decide new node's id
    when new node can be added, but it is not appropriate for 
    current code.
  - Remove extra \n from ACPI_TRACE_FUNCTION().
  - Update for 2.6.16-rc2-mm1.
  - Tested on x86_64 box with SRAT & DSDT emulation.
Please comment.
