As I mentioned in my last post, I don't think the "synchronized
rebalancing" is a real concern since the interval isn't likely to be the
same and the CPU_OFFSET macro is already in place to prevent this "rash
of balancing" (nice term :-).

IMO, scheduler statistics are not worth running load_balance() for no
reason.  (And running it two or three times in a row is clearly not
accomplishing anything)

Not seeing in obvious problems, but the existing logic seems incorrect
to me (and the term last_balanced is currently misleading).  Running
load_balance() multiple times in order to catch up seems wasteful to me
as well.  The current code says something like: run load_balance() 10
times in a second.  If the second is almost up and you have only run it
6 times, it will run it 4 times in a row, that just seems wrong to me.
