Unfortunatelly this firmware does not work with my modem. I get this
thing in the debug log:
Jul 10 09:26:27 srv kernel: speedtch 1-2:1.0: speedtch_upload_firmware entered
Jul 10 09:26:27 srv kernel: speedtch 1-2:1.0:
speedtch_upload_firmware: BLOCK1 uploaded (935 bytes)
Jul 10 09:26:29 srv kernel: usb 1-2: speedtch timed out on ep5in len=0/512
And it hangs at this point for a couple of minutes, so I have to
manually remove the speedtch module. As far as I can see my modem is
revision 2.00 (kernel searches for firmware speedtch-1.bin.2.00).
I also tried a couple of other firmwares available on the net, and
also the one from Windows XP install (which works and achieves speeds
of up to 720kbyte/sec downlink). Some of the firmwares did not work
either, and some worked the same way - it means not more than 3mbit/s
(around 400kbyte/s) could be achieved.
