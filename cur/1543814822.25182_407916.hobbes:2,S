Subject: [2.6 patch] let x86 subarchs select SMP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/18/107

The SMP question comes after the subarch question, and it does therefore 
make sense to let the SMP-only subarchs select SMP instead of depending 
on it.
