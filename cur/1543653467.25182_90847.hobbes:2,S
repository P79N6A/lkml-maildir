Got it. This actually isn't a problem with new ACPI code, but
the addition of the new stack overflow check. It falls flat on
its face really early if that is enabled.
The box is totally dead before console is initialised, so I
don't have backtraces, I'll give that a shot with a serial
console later. In the meantime, acpi folks should probably
try testing with CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW=y to see if they
hit the same problems I'm getting.
Back later..
