Umm, there's one thing you need to remember about these
high dbench loads though.
They run fastest when you run each of the dbench forks
sequentially and have the others stuck in get_request_wait.
This, of course, is completely unacceptable for real-world
server scenarios, where all users of the server need to be
serviced fairly.
