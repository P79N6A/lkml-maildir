T10/990D (SBC) rev. 8b, 8 July 1997.
excerpt from 6.1.4 speaking about READ(6) 
" this command has been maintained as mandatory since some system
  initialization routines require that the READ(6) command be 
  used. Application clients should migrate from the READ(6) command 
  to the READ(10) command ....... "
This let me think like OSes and pass-through applications are suggested
since a long time to no longer use READ(6), even with devices that are
still required to implement it.

The MMC specs does not tell about READ(6) being mandatory (assuming the
device model is that one).

We should not use READ(6) at all in our current SCSI stuff.
I remember having posted about that years ago.

Using READ(6) is irrelevant since years. I do think it is severe bug 
to still use READ(6) as default read command in current SCSI access
methods.
  Gérard.
PS: people that have old devices that donnot implement READ(6) should 
    upgrade their hardware or use old softwares, but not require softwares 
    to support everything that has ever existed.
