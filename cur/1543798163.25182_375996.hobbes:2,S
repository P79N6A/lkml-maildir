1) the BKL change hasn't finished, and we're 5 years down the line. API
changes done gradual tend to take forever in practice, esp if there's no
"compile" incentive for people to fix things. 
2) the scsi rewrite was a major functional change. that's different from
a basically pure API change (split). Splitting functional changes to one
part of the kernel up into a sequence is very good. THat's different
though: even in the scsi change, API changes that went outside the scsi
core into the drivers were mostly done in one bang (not all of them, the
ones that weren't ended up being rather painful)
