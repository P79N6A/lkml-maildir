Those are supposed to be userland-only headers that don't just change - they 
are gradually expanded. I don't see a point in having `uname -r` in there.
And another thing - distribution vendors will *hate* anyone, that encourages 
app developers to add an include path based on which kernel is being 
currently run. People, that have their headers tied to their kernels are a 
*minority*.
(though iirc eg. netfilter is a mess, so there might be bigger reasons to 
ignore my arguments; not that I won't hate you if you do, and I'll have to 
patch everything, just to get it compiled)
