You mean Dickens pages ;)
They were caused by a race between truncate and filemap_nopage(), iirc. 
nopage was sleeping on the read I/O and truncate would come in and tear
down the pagetables.  Then the read I/O completes and nopage reinstantiates
the page outside i_size after truncate ripped it off the mapping.  truncate
was unable to free the page because ext3 happened to have a ref via the
page's buffer_heads.  Something like that.
But these pages should no longer exist, due to the truncate_count logic in
do_no_page().
However I'm not sure that this (truly revolting) problem which Rajesh
identified:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0402.2/1155.html
Cannot cause them to come back.
I really do want to fix that problem via locking: say taking i_shared_sem
inside mremap().  i_shared_sem is a very innermost lock and the ranking
with mmap_sem is all wrong.
For now, it would be sufficient to put a debug printk in there somewhere to
see if we are still getting Dickens pages.
