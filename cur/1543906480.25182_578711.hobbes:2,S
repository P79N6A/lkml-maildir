Thanks for pointing this out. So it seems that maybe the mainline revert 
of pie-randomization.patch was a little bit premature. Bret -- could you 
please clarify whether you have experienced also klibc-related segfaults 
with pie-randomization.patch applied, or you have had just random binaries 
segfaulting, as you pointed out here: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/21/31
Seems like you are also using ubuntu, same as Ulrich, so you might have 
been hitting the very same behavior of klibc-1.4.
Thanks in advance for clarifying this, so that I can eventually resubmit 
the pie-randomization patch.
Thanks,
