Hi,
I have a problem with broadcomm 5700 based card.
It's autonegotiating a wrong media and I can't change the parameters of another
end of link. So how I can force specified media technology with tg3-driver?
Mii-tool doesn't seem to work and I didn't find any option for tg3-module.
I have version 1.5 of tg3.c and Linux version 2.4.21-rc2.
