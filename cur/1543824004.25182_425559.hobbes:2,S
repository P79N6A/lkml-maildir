Sure, it does make sense to ask for comments before starting with an 
implementation.
But discussing possible patches also becomes kind of stupid if you
aren't willing to implement it yourself.
There have already been more than enough discussions regarding this 
issue - if he still considers his idea worth it HE must start with the 
implementation NOW.
He seems to be the kind of troll who wants to convince other people of 
his "great" ideas without writing a single line of code himself.

In this case, 0% exactly.

It does not raise the issue of a stable kernel API:
The solution is to work on getting the module included into the kernel. 
All problems with changing kernel APIs vanish as soon as your module is 
included. This is independent from what the module in question is doing.
Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt explains the advantages of not 
having a stable API.
