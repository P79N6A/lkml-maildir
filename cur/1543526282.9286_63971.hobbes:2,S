I have seen one occurance of this on my machine - dual Pentium IIIs.
2.3.43.
ls <file-name> would list the file.
ls -l <file-name> would generate an I/O error, as would any other
attempt to open the file.
Rebooted a day or two later (after my first occurance of seeing the
missing interrupt for /dev/hda for the first time ever - system
would not recover).  fsck reported a bad/unused inode.  The inode
number was around 26,000.
