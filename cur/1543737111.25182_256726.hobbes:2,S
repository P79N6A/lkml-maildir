I have a 'little' problem. PS2 mouse is jerky as hell, an when you mismatch
the protocol in X. Both in console and X.
I'm lucky I have an usb mouse.
One other question. Isn't /dev/input/mice supposed to be a multiplexor
for mice ? I think I remember some time when I could have both a PS2 and
a USB mouse connected and X pointer followed both. Now if I boot with the
USB mouse plugged, the PS2 one does not work. If I boot with usb unplugged
and plug it after boot, both work; usb mouse works fine, and PS2 just
jumps half screen each time I move it, and with big delays.
Something is broken in PS2 handling ?
NOTE: they are not really standard protocol mice, but trackballs; PS2 one is
a Logitech TrackMan Marble FX, and the other a Cordless Trackman FX, usb.
TIA
