I believe you can reset them to zero, but I don't think you can set them
to anything else.  I had to do something similar a few years ago, and I
don't have the specs in front of me, so this is coming straight from
memory.
Even if you could reset them, it would be very difficult to make all CPUs
have the same counter. Not to mention that this would also screw up all
timings elsewhere when the sync happens. Remember, this would have to work
not just on 2 cpus, but 4, 8 and beyond.
