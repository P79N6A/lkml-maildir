Even if we cannot _now_, isn't that an easier, and safer change? (and
I don't think we lose anything by design).
Although I don't know KVM to a that deep level, I think it should be
possible to keep the virtual cpus in different process (or threads),
and take the accounting time from there. Perfectly possible to know
the time we spent running (user time), and the time the hypervisor
spent doing things on our behalf (system time).
