As far as ia64 is concerned, you could replace ia64_cmpxchg4_acq()
with cmpxchg().  That should just work.  Of course, as you point out,
that wouldn't work on x86 UP because of the missing "lock" prefix.
Sounds like you'd need to add something along the lines of
device_atomic_cmpxchg() or something like that...
