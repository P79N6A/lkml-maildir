Andrea,
How did you generate the 00_rwsem-generic-1 patch? Against what did you diff?
You seem to have removed all the optimised i386 rwsem stuff... Did it not work
for you?

Can you supply a test case that demonstrates it not working?

I quick look says it shouldn't be faster (inline functions and all that).
However, I think you might be right about it being too dependent on the
algorithm I put in, and that is easy to change.

Could be very easily changed.
