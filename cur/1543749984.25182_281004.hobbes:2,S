hi everyone,
I'm having this weird problem with both my laptop and desktop.
when using kernels 2.6.10-rc3 through 2.6.10-rc3-bk15, including mm patches or 
ck patches, not all programs can resolve hostnames.
lynx www.google.pt
fails because it can't resolve the hostname.
host www.google.pt
works.
lynx www.google.pt
fails again. appearently it's not using the same resolve method as host.
I've tried other hostnames and the results are consistent. The solution, I 
found, was to leave only "nameserver" lines in /etc/resolv.conf. weird, I guess, 
but it solves the problem. the resolv.conf is written by the dhcp client and 
it's not wrong, since it worked and other kernels don't have problems.
this doesn't happen with 2.6.9, 2.6.9-ck3, 2.6.9-ac16 kernels. they work ok.
any tips? I can print straces if someone finds them useful.
this is ALLWAYS reproducible. could it be a kernel bug?
regards,
pedro venda.
