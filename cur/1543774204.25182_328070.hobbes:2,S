One quick question.
Since lock_kiocb() may block, does that mean that the aio worker thread
could be put to sleep while an iocb cancellation is in progress, even though
there may be other iocbs/ioctx's to process ?
Looking at the rest a little more closely in terms of how everything
will fit together, a few questions come to mind - need to think
about it a little more. I guess the main reason you need the aio_down_wait
callback is to make sure the semaphore is grabbed right in the context
of the wakeup rather than at retry time, is that correct ?
