This is a quick guide to current libata work that is queued or in 
progress in some way, shape or form.
First, a guide to the branches currently in use in 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/libata-dev.git
   ALL
Everything that is exported for testing (and akpm's -mm tree). 
Currently consists of upstream-fixes + upstream + sil680-mmio branches.
   master
Vanilla upstream linux-2.6.git tree.
   mv-ahci-pata
Marvell 6121/6141 PATA support.  Needs fixing in the 'PATA controller 
command' area before it is usable, and can go upstream.
   mv-ncq
sata_mv NCQ support.  Code is complete and /should/ be working, but it 
does nothing but timeout and fallback to non-NCQ here.  Needs debugging 
before can go upstream.
   new-eh
Convert sata_qstor and sata_sx4 to new EH.  Each needs 
testing/verification before it can go upstream.
   pmask
Add proto_mask to LLDDs, alongside pio_mask, udma_mask, etc.
   sii-lbt
Enable Large Block Transfer mode on sata_sil.  Verified to work locally, 
but some bug reports on the 'net need to be tracked down before this can 
go upstream.
   sil680-mmio
BenH's MMIO patch for pata_sil680.  Some MMIO/flushing type issues were 
raised on the list, a solution was reached.  That solution must be coded 
before this can go upstream.
   upstream
Everything queued for 2.6.24.  Includes everything in upstream-fixes.
   upstream-fixes
Everything queued for 2.6.23-rc.  This tends to go upstream rapidly.
mbox queue, prefixed by author:
* Kristen: ALPM patches.  We definitely want them, as they save a ton of 
power.
* Tony Vroon: LED trigger....  hmmm
* Alan: IORDY handling -- upstream whenever Alan is happy
* Tejun: improved probe info printout.  Want to test and review in 
depth, but probably OK
* Alan: ACPI checks for 80wire cable -- upstream whenever Alan is happy
* Tejun:  Port Multiplier Support -- I still need to review in depth, 
but would like go ahead and push ata_link in
* NVIDIA: sata_nv SW NCQ: need to review WRT FIS state machine, though I 
saw some flaws in there.  OK if that is OK.
* Albert: irq_on/off.  Really need to give this some thought.  Not sure 
I like where this model is going.  Polling and twiddling irq on/off 
should be kept to a minimum, because it's sorta an admission that the 
host state machine has broken down, and we need to bandaid.  Its a 
bandaid not a root-cause solution.
* Albert: minor PIO fixes.  Need to review in depth.
* Kristen: AN: it seems that things got stuck once Al Viro voiced an 
objection?
* Ben Collins: cleanup HPA support.  Need to review and see what's 
needed today, from this patch.
