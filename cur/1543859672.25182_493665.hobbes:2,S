The root of the problem is that copy_to_user() may cause page faults
on the userspace buffer, and the page fault might (in case of a
maliciously crafted filesystem) recurse into the filesystem itself.
This applies to get_user_pages() as well, but in that case the
function taking the fault is different from the one doing the copy,
hence the original request can be aborted while in get_user_pages().
It cannot be aborted during the copy (since data belonging to the
original request is still being used), but unlike copy_to_user(),
memcpy() will never block.

But flush_dcache_page() has already been called in get_user_pages(),
so the user mappings are flushed before copying the data to the kernel
mapping, and only the kernel mapping need to be flushed _after_ the
copying.

Agreed.
