Could we please get an ftrace capture of the incident?
Firstly, it makes sense to simplify the tracing environment as much as 
possible: for example single-CPU traces are much easier to interpret.
Can you reproduce it with just one CPU online? I.e. if you offline all the 
other cores via:
  echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
  [etc.]
and keep CPU#0 only, do the latencies still occur?
If they do still occur, then please do the traces that way.
[ If they do not occur then switch back on all CPUs - we'll sort out the
  traces ;-) ]
Then please build a function tracer kernel, by enabling:
  CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER=y
  CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER=y
  CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE=y
Once you boot into such a kernel, you can switch on function tracing via:
  cd /debug/tracing/
  echo 0 > tracing_enabled
  echo function_graph > current_tracer
  echo funcgraph-proc > trace_options 
It does not run yet, first find a suitable set of functions to trace. For 
example this will be a pretty good starting point for scheduler+KVM 
problems:
  echo ''         > set_ftrace_filter  # clear filter functions
  echo '*sched*' >> set_ftrace_filter 
  echo '*wake*'  >> set_ftrace_filter
  echo '*kvm*'   >> set_ftrace_filter
  echo 1 > tracing_enabled             # let the tracer go
You can see your current selection of functions to trace via 'cat 
set_ftrace_filter', and you can see all functions via 'cat 
available_filter_functions'.
You can also trace all functions via:
  echo '*' > set_ftrace_filter
Tracer output can be captured from the 'trace' file. It should look like 
this:
 15)   cc1-28106    |   0.263 us    |    page_evictable();
 15)   cc1-28106    |               |    lru_cache_add_lru() {
 15)   cc1-28106    |   0.252 us    |      __lru_cache_add();
 15)   cc1-28106    |   0.738 us    |    }
 15)   cc1-28106    | + 74.026 us   |  }
 15)   cc1-28106    |               |  up_read() {
 15)   cc1-28106    |   0.257 us    |    _spin_lock_irqsave();
 15)   cc1-28106    |   0.253 us    |    _spin_unlock_irqrestore();
 15)   cc1-28106    |   1.329 us    |  }
To capture a continuous stream of all trace data you can do:
  cat trace_pipe > /tmp/trace.txt
(this will also drain the trace ringbuffers.)
Note that this can be quite expensive if there are a lot of functions that 
are traced - so it makes sense to trim down the set of traced functions to 
only the interesting ones. Which are the interesting ones can be 
determined from looking at the traces. You should see your KVM threads 
getting active every second as the ping happens.
If you get lost events you can increase the trace buffer size via the 
buffer_size_kb control - the default is around 1.4 MB.
Let me know if any of these steps is causing problems or if interpreting 
the traces is difficult.
