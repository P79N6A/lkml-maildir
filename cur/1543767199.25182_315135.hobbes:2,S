I should mention one obvious thing - there can be two wire protocols 
here (at least for the CIFS case) - an optimized case which matches -- 
exactly -- to the [better] new semantics that Linux allows and the 
interoperability case (which can be less efficient) ie
the existing Transact2 NOTIFY mechanism which is widely supported by 
current servers and currently defined in fs/cifs/cifspdu.h
I don't mind, nor do others on the Samba team, extending the wire 
protocol for CIFS where it would help that - "killer app" as long as it is
    - optional
    - persuasive benefit
    - helps the network case to better match the -- exact -- local 
semantics applications would expect.
