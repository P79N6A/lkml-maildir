That's where pci_enable_device() *USED* to be - this is backing out a change
made in 2.5.50 - it added the if/continue wrapper and moved it up about 15
lines in the code. The problem seems to be that for many devices,
pci_enable_device() fails unless we do the pci_writeb() magic first.  Or
perhaps it's the call to pci_assign_resource() - I don't know. ;) The 2.4.18
tree has the pci_enable_device() at the same place - just without the if/
continue around it.  It can't be THAT evil, as that's the way 2.4.0 to 2.4.18
and 2.5.0 to 2.5.49 did it.. ;)
I see why the if/continue was added - you don't want to be calling
device_register()/pci_insert_device() if pci_enable_device() loses.  I don't
see why 2.5.50 moved the code up after pci_setup_device(). There's an outside
chance that the concept of moving the call was correct, but that it should have
been moved to between the calls to pci_assign_resource() and pci_readb().
If that's the case, then you're correct as well....
