"They surely are clear bugs" is wrong, the proof is the trivial fact 
that not less than 148 kernel issues have already been marked as FALSE 
inside the Coverity tracker.

If you'd have followed linux-kernel for a while, you'd have seen how 
many patches have already been sent and merged for issues listed there.
You can set any aim you want, but since the vast majority of these 
issues are not regressions from 2.6.16 there's no reason delaying 2.6.17 
for it.
Even more considering that even many of the Coverity issues are often 
harmless issues like e.g. dead code.
