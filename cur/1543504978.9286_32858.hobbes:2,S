THREAD CROSSOVER WARNING!
The man page is for libc5. glibc2 has a crypt() that recognizes MD5. The
documentation is in libc.info.

Whether the passwd command uses MD5 or DES is configurable. If you installed
that redhat 6 yourself, you may remember that one of the last things it asked
you during installation was whether to use a shadow file, and right under
that (or above it? I forget) is the question of whether to use MD5.
If you want to change it later, look for something like this in
/etc/pam.d/passwd:
password   required     /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so use_authtok nullok md5 shadow
Add the "md5" flag and from now on, passwd will generate MD5 passwords.

Regardless of what the passwd command does, if you are using glibc2, you can
paste both DES and MD5 passwords into /etc/{shadow,passwd}. The crypt()
function knows what to do with both of them.

Now try these:
23:18 a0 defiant /home/pacman %./makepw frogfrogfrog '$1$ab'
$1$ab$5QaA5.UYDkUepc57ReItF1
23:18 a0 defiant /home/pacman %./makepw frogfrogfrog '$1$abcdef'
$1$abcdef$u0JTi3SVt4RTys6qBZOqT/
23:19 a0 defiant /home/pacman %./makepw frogfrogfrog '$1$abcdef$u0JTi3SVt4RTys6qBZOqT/'
$1$abcdef$u0JTi3SVt4RTys6qBZOqT/
23:18 a0 defiant /home/pacman %./makepw frogfrogfrogfrog '$1$abcdef'
$1$abcdef$k1q1hqeG2D9z96JUqkzm81
Look at that! Just by taking out the truncation, your program now works
correctly with MD5's long passwords and salts!

Unless the salt starts with "$1$", which is used to signal MD5.

You said you have redhat 6. Unless you're David Parsons in disguise, I find
it hard to believe that you really removed glibc2, so you _do_ have the
MD5-aware crypt.

And it was not a bad demonstration, but those salt truncations always bug me
because the crypt function is going to do its own truncation anyway, so you
are really just making your program more complicated than it needs to be.
For verifying a previously existing password, you could make things really
complicated, and write your own check for the $1$ and extract the salt (which
extends up to the next $), and truncate there, in addition to your
2-character DES truncation code... or you could just pass the unmodified
pw_passwd or sp_pwdp to crypt() and let it do the work for you.
