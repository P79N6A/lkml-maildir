The host->removed member is only used for this simple test. It is set in
mmc_host_remove() to indicate that the removal process has begun. At
this point it is invalid to call mmc_detect_change() (the place this
patch fixes). So the spinlocks are mostly there so that things are
properly ordered when we go SMP. Some creative barriers would probably
work as well, but I find spinlocks more "normal" and hence more readable.
