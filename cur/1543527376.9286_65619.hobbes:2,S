When sending a patch to linux-kernel, you should consider running
	finger @ftp.kernel.org
to make sure you are diffing against the latest version.  In this case
you are a couple versions behind, so part of your patch now applies to
drivers/net/tulip/tulip.h and part of your patch applies to
drivers/net/tulip/tulip_core.c.
I've manually applied a slightly different version of your patch to my
local tree, and will send it off to Linus soon.
Also I find it good practice to CC also patches to linux-tulip too...
thanks for the patch!
	Jeff
