At least you weren't the target of attacks there ... for daring to
actually follow the only published Linux style guide in that area!!

Having a style guide is supposed to mean, among other things, that
following it gives you "safe harbor".  Sigh.

Yeah, well even the chief penguin wrangler has occasionally
admitted to human imperfections.  Not exclusively related to
the 0.99 kernel series, either ...  ;)

I approve in particular of that location:  beginning of line, where
they aren't masking the intent of the condition from a casual scan.
If there's a "right" place, that's it.
In particular, if you see lots of "&&" or "||" neatly lined up it
helps you understand something about when the conditional's body
will execute without needing to read to the end of every line.

Yeah, nobody likes style nazis.  On the other hand, it's rather
unusual to be the target of style nazism for actually following
the style guide!!  You'd think that maybe the folk objecting to
that style guide might maybe choose a more direct way to address
their particular frustrations, eh?  :)
