This argument is the obvious nonsense. "Runs on TiVO" is a property of
the software that TiVO distributes -- such an important property that
it would be nonsensical for them to distribute it with their hardware.
But they do distribute it, and only the GPL allows them to.
Linus' key is not required to use the software Linus distributes under
the GPL, by contrast.

Says judge Schwartz. Oops. That's right, you're not a judge in any
legal jurisdiction, nor an author of the GPL.
