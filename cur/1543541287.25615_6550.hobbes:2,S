Simple: Write a note of what test is being performed to a file, then write
the results. It's obvious enough if you get a log file like:
Test 1343: Try stressing VM subsystem ... OK
Test 1344: Stress-testing mmap() ...
Obviously more information would be nice, but not always possible. Using a
serial console and logging the output on another machine should give
fairly good results, though?

Yep. Using a serial console should enable reasonable information capture,
and the script can have a standard set of "failure responses" to run if a
test returns a failure of any sort?

Indeed. The other question is, how to handle deadlocks? I'd probably use a
serial console, being logged by another machine; if the machine dies, just
reboot, then have the machine resume testing where it left off.
