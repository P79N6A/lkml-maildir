Yes. What I'm saying (or trying to) is that such an implementation
would be flawed by design.

We're not talking about an implementation based on AppArmor. As
you point out, we're talking about implementing name based access
control as an extension of SELinux.

Is it general practice to configure policy such that "the new file gets
the most restrictive label possible at creation time"? I confess that
my understanding of the current practice in policy generation is based
primarily on a shouted conversation in a crowded Irish pub.

Yes, I am aware of restorecond. I find the need for restorecond troubling.

Yup, I see that once you accept the notion that it is OK for a
file to be misslabeled for a bit and that having a fixxerupperd
is sufficient it all falls out.
My point is that there is a segment of the security community
that had not found this acceptable, even under the conditions
outlined. If it meets your needs, I say run with it.
