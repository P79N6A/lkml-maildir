Hi all,
here is a little program which uses the inotify's functionnality. This 
soft lists a given directory in live. The informations are updated when 
an event occur. If no event occur, the process does nothing and sleeps !
The soft needs the libncurses (and inotify patch of course).
rml advised me to post this to the lkml so the others will be able to 
see how nice the inotify stuff is :)
You can download the soft here :
