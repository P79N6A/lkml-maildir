Hi
SpadFS doesn't write to unallocated parts like log filesystems (LFS) or 
phase tree filesystems (TUX2); it writes inside normal used structures, 
but it marks each structure with generation tags --- when it updates 
global table of tags, it atomically makes several structures valid. I 
don't know about this idea being used elsewhere.
It's fsync is slow too (needs to write all (meta)data too), but it at 
least doesn't livelock --- fsync is basically:
* write all buffers and wait for completion
* take lock preventing metadata updates
* write all buffers again (those that were updated while previous write 
was in progress) and wait for completion
* update global generation count table
* release the lock
Maybe Suse will be paying me from this autumn to make more features to it 
--- so far it works, doesn't eat data, but isn't much known :)
