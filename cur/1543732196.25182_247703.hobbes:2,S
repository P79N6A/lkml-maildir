This oops is very mysterious, because it indicates that sc->intf was
NULL, which is not possible when device_remove_file was called.
I'll look at it. For the moment, just make sure you have this:

It won't resolve your oops, but at least the I/O should succeed now,
so you would have a chance to unmount the thing before unplugging.
