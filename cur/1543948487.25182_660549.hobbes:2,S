This one has 36bit physical address space. You can verify that via
/proc/cpuinfo

While the physical address of your ioremap is 47000ee000.
2^ 36 == 1000000000
---->    47000ee000
So the fault is not very surprising. Unfortunately we do not check,
whether physaddr is inside the valid physical address space. I whip up
a patch to do that.
Can you please instrument the driver to figure out where this
information comes from ? Or maybe lspci tells already.
Thanks,
