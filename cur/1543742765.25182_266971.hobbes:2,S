Cool.  But I'd like to clarify something someone else said, for the record.

There are really three distinct chunks of information in BK:
    - the source code under management
    - the metadata created by users, i.e., checkin comments.  We also
      consider user names, dates, and timestamps to be created by users
      even though BK itself does that for you.
    - the metadata created by BK 
The license and ownership of kernel source code managed by BK has nothing
to do with BK nor the BK license.
There is a question as to whether the metadata created by the users
is GPLed.  It's not because it falls under the separate works part
of the GPL.  If that metadata were GPLed then your user name in an
inode is GPLed if you were putting a GPLed file into a filesystem.
That's a boundary you aren't going to be able to cross no matter how
hard you try (note: you can start arguing about this and I'll ignore 
you, we've been over this).
Just to make our position clear, consider this a formal declaration that
we make no claims of ownership of user created metadata, as defined above,
and impose no restrictions on its use.  I suspect that this declaration
isn't needed, you ought to have rights to your own name and checkin
comments, but let's make sure that there is no confusion about that.
There is the question of metadata created by BK.  That's also not GPLed
for the same reasons.  This metadata is more like the block pointers in
a file system.  While you may use BK, if you have a license, to dig out
your data and the user created metadata, you aren't entitled to expose the
internal BK metadata.  That falls under the reverse engineering clause,
non-compete clause, etc.  I realize you don't like this if you are trying
to create a competing product but that's the way things are.
Please respect that just as we are respecting your rights to your data.
