My experience is totally opposite. I'm running a production
mail server with sendmail and cyrus and have tested about every
kernel from 2.2 tree but they all pause for tens of seconds,
when load is higher more often making sometimes machine unusable.
The 2.2.17pre9 +  Andrea's VM-global-patch-1 makes no difference
for this setup. 
Also running: Mingo's RAID, SMP
