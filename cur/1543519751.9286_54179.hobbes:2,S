No. All original... your case design may be a factor. I have an Enlight
with 2 other fans besides the ps/fan. 1 front mounted pulling air in and
1 larger one at the back even with the ps.(You can feel a strong flow
from front to back over the video card and out almost even with the
cpu's.) I have the original Intel fans that came in the retail packages.
I meant to change them but @2.05v the average temp is 85-89degrees and
the internal system temp is usually 5 degrees cooler. At 2.10v the
temperature immediately jumps over 100 degrees. The Enlight case is also
much longer than normal. The BP6 fit with room to spare.

Very possible but if it gets errors at 66Mhz I would say the chip is out
of spec. From experience I would say *every* Celeron should clock at
75Mhz effortlessly, error free. The 400 being the best for higher
speeds. Intels design spec is pretty much maxed out at 450 for the
Celeron I was told. 
*100Mhz* I was a little dissappointed today. I opened a package 
we got yesterday assuming the new 100FSB Celerons were there. Our
distributor put them on the order sheet so I ordered a few assuming they
were out. Thats the only place they exist I guess... the order sheet. I
guess were all stuck with 300A and 366A's for 100FSB once again.
