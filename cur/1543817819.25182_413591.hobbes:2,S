the warning means that doing a preempt_enable_no_resched() while being 
in a preemptible section is most likely a bug, and that you could lose a 
need_resched() check. (and introduce a scheduling latency) What's the 
backtrace? This could be the sign of a not fully/correctly converted 
arch/*/kernel/process.c (but i'm only guessing here).

you should first check the PREEMPT_NONE kernel with PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS and 
PREEMPT_HARDIRQS enabled. I.e. first check whether IRQ threading works.  
Then enable all the other PREEMPT options one by one: PREEMPT_DESKTOP, 
PREEMPT_RCU, PREEMPT_BKL. Only when all these work switch to PREEMPT_RT.
