No. CONFIG_M* doesn't determine the size of the state. Feature information from
the 'cpuid' instruction will dictate the size allocated/used. Anyhow, please
wait for the xsave patches.

It need not be only FPU. We can have non-math state here aswell.
selected 'xstate' for extended state. I am all open for any reasonable name,
reflecting math, extended math(fsave/fxsave/..) and future math/
non-math extensions.

alignment is now specified as part of kmem_cache_create() and checed
in the allocation routines.
