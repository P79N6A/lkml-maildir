Resend, the original has not appear in l-k archives.  Did we lose a
chunk of l-k today?
The kallsyms section in arch/i386/vmlinux.lds.S is in the wrong place.
kallsyms data is read only, it should be with the rest of the read only
sections like .rodata, .kstrtab, __ex_table, __ksymtab etc.  Making it
separate increases memory use for small systems (embedded machines can
keep read only data in ROM) and slows down large systems (NUMA boxes
can replicate read only data and text on each node for faster access).
The placement of kallsyms in kdb was done for very good reasons.
Congratulations, you managed to take working kdb code and introduce
multiple errors over three kernel releases, and it is still not
correct!
