The ioctl which is used by
	blockdev --setra
is still in 512-byte units.
There are other backdoors such as IDE-private /proc files which can be used
to set readahead.  I'm not sure what units they use, and I don't know what
mechanism hdparm is using to diddle readahead.
Whatever it is, I suggest you ignore it and use /sbin/blockdev; it works
for all disk types.
