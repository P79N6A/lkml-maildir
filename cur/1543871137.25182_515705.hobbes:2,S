This is similar to what I have been experiencing.  I have not been able
to get my laptop to run 2.6.21-rc2-mm1 for more than 5 minutes.  The
last kernel I had working was 2.6.20-rc6-mm3.
The problems may be multiple.  Whenever I load the new bcm43xx drivers
and do *anything* with iwconfig, it locks hard.  No keyboard LEDs, and
sysrq does not work.
While I had it in single-user mode, no bcm43xx drivers loaded, I was
using make menuconfig to try a different configuration, and it locked
hard for no apparent reason.  Again, no keyboard LEDs, no sysrq.
Laptop fans come on full speed after a bit, so something is still
happening in the BIOS.
