I did not ignore your new "primary issues", to the contrary. Please read 
my replies. To recap, your "primary issues" are:

to both points i (and others) already replied in great detail - please 
follow up on them. (I can quote message-IDs if you cannot find them.)
[ Or if it's not these two then let me know if i missed some important 
  point - it's easy to miss a valid point in a sea of of replies. 
  For example yesterday i have replied to 7 different issues _you_ 
  raised, partly issues where you have questioned my credibility and 
  competence, so i felt compelled to reply - but still you replied to 
  none of those mails, only declaring them "secondary" in a passing 
  reference. If they were secondary then why did you raise them in the 
  first place? Or do you summarily concede all those points by not 
  replying to them? And is there any guarantee that you will reply to
  any mails i write to you now? Will you declare them "secondary" too 
  once the argument appears to turn unfavorable to your position? ]
