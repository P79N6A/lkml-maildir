Is 132F too hot for an XP-2800?  Based on my experience with an 
XP1400, which ran for several years well above 165F, I'd think not. 
And its running at about 2150 mhz.  My previous XP1400 ran, and is 
running at 1400 mhz in a new board, ran near 170F in the old board, 
but now in a Mach Speed board with a 233mhz fsb, its only running at 
34C.  There is a Zalman flower with a 4" fan turning at 1834 rpms on 
this XP2800, and a glaciator on the XP1400 turning about 6 grand, 
noisy.
This ones running setiathome of course, and so was the XP1400 when it 
was in this machine.

Yikes, I'll have to save this out, and make it all into one line with 
vim & give it a try.  ATM though, I've got a cold & headed back to 
bed.  Friggin miserable.
Thanks again.
