Hi,
I am kernel newbie, especially with logging filesystems.
Now I am using Mandrake 7.1 with 2.4.3 kernel and imon patch
and NVidia drivers compiled into the kernel.
Now, all my partitions are ReiserFS. I usually play quake once
or twice a day. Sometimes graphics subsystem freezes up, so it takes
keyboard input. Caps and Numlock are working fine, unless I try to kill
X with ctrlalt-backspace. So I reset my machine with hardware switch.
here is the interesting part... after I reset my machine like that,
some files start to appear corrupted. Segmentation faults etc. 
Isn't reiserfs suppose to be safe? NOW, THE REAL SPOOKY PART:
I reboot my machine with normal procedure, like shutdonw -r now,
and on other boot, corrupted files FIX themselves. Any insight?
I think it is rather unacceptable...
cheers,
	pavel
