The newer modutils package doesn't use query_modules and calling
that function will return -ENOSYS in 'modern' kernels. The
latest modutils becomes very sparse because most of the module
functionality got moved into the kernel where it expanded, err,..
don't get me started. Anyway, your user-mode interface is now
/proc/modules. It does provide a bit more information than
before, but as you noticed, it sucks^M^M^M^M^Mis not nice.
Have fun!
