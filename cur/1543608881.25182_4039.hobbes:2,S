I'm all for simplifying the internal kernel interfaces.  What I'm not
at *all* convinced about is that it's worth it to make serious changes
to the layout of /proc, /proc/sys, etc.  And the concept of being able
to very rapidly and easily get at system configuration variables
without needing to make sure that /proc is mounted is a very, very
good thing.  
While sysctl isn't the most compact way of doing things, it *is*
simpler than doing things using a raw /proc interfaces.  If you just
want sysctl to modify a single integer variable, it's basically just a
table entry and a call to register that table with sysctl.  If you
want to do more sophisticated things, then yes, it gets more
complicated faster than it probably should.  
But the bottom line is as far as I'm concerned is:
Baby.  Bathwater.  Let's not throw out the wrong thing....
