In the BIOS I tried AUTO on all the drives. I have to explicitly enable
32 bit IO in the bios for each drive, it came up default off. I just enabled
it because 32 bit IO sounded better, but maybe it's not. I didn't try it
with it off. I also tried USER on all the drives where I can then set
the IO mode. There were 5 PIO settings possible plus 2 DMA things, which
I think were UDMA but I can't recall exactly. On all of those I chose the
UDMA2. Otherwise all the settings were identical to what AUTO set them.
Whether AUTO or USER made no difference in performance or in the kernel
messages.
I also have multi device support/raid 0/raid 5 enabled. The drives are
not partitioned, I use the drive itself in the /dev/md0 array. That's
why I get the kernel partition error messages.
I can try some stuff (except a reboot, until Monday). I'm off site now and
can't bring the machine down, but harmless experiments are ok, if there is
anything you want me to try.
