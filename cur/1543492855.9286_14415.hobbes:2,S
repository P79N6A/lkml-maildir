Yes, I was very happy when Eric suggested the immutable bit, since it
allows us to solve both the problem of older kernels plus utility
compatibility.

But, as far as I can tell, setuid0 only helps us with binaries that were

executables that formerly were just _run_ by root.  I do _not_ want
binaries to inherit everything.
