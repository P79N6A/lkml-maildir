Urk! A ThinkPad... :)  
I presume plain test6 works for you. In that case, a good place to add
some debugging would be the end of io_apic.c.
Directly after: 
    /* Some BIOSes disable the local APIC in the APIC_BASE MSR */
    rdmsr(0x1b, l, h);
Add:
    printk("XXX APIC_BASE=%08x:%08x  pic_mode=%d  nr_ioapics=%d\n",
           h, l, pic_mode, nr_ioapics);
    printk("XXX phys_cpu_present_map=%d\n", phys_cpu_present_map);
    for ( ; ; ) ;
And mail me the two lines of debug output. If the two lines don't come
out at all then my patch isn't being executed.
 Thanks,
 Keir Fraser
