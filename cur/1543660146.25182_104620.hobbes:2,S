[crossposted to IrDA-users and l-k]
The quest to set up properly (or give up where not possible) my new Dell Latitude
 C640 is moving forward... next target, IrDA. This laptop has a chip that is not
 detected by the 'findchip' tool but is detected by kernel code (SMC LPC47N252).
My base distro is a RH8.0, with the modified rc.sysinit to allow modules to properly
 work even with newer kernels.
When irport is loaded (or perhaps when irattach is run), the module complains saying
irport_net_open(), unable to allocate irq=0
It does load, but as expected it doesn't seem to work - irdadump doesn't come up
 with any line at all.
Any hints ? Thanks in advance, ciao,
--alessandro
