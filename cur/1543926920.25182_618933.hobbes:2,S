Worst case it would take 13.  In practice I've seen less.  Part of it
is I suspect that I'm starting with something more recent than the
previous 2.6.23, but rather a daily -git13 or -git14 tree.  Part of it
may be because git can sometimes be more efficient by cutting off
entire branches with trail builds, since git history isn't completely
linear, but rather pulls of various branches together.
