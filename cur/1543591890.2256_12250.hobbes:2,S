Somebody should officially certify 2.95.2 (or better 2.95.3, if all the
kernel related bugs are solved), and change:
"The recommended compiler for the kernel is egcs 1.1.2 (gcc 2.91.66), and it
should be used when you need absolute stability. You may use gcc 2.95.x
instead if you wish, although it may cause problems."
