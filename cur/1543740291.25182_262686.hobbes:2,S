POSIX specifies:
The recvmsg( ) function shall fail if:
[EAGAIN] or [EWOULDBLOCK] The socket's file descriptor is marked 
O_NONBLOCK and no data is waiting to be received; or MSG_OOB is set and 
no out-of-band data is available and either the socket s file descriptor 
is marked O_NONBLOCK or the socket does not support blocking to await 
out-of-band data.
[EBADF] The socket argument is not a valid open file descriptor.
[ECONNRESET] A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.
[EINTR] This function was interrupted by a signal before any data was 
available.
[EINVAL] The sum of the iov_len values overflows a ssize_t, or the 
MSG_OOB flag is set 37371 and no out-of-band data is available.
[EMSGSIZE] The msg_iovlen member of the msghdr structure pointed to by 
message is less 37373 than or equal to 0, or is greater than {IOV_MAX}.
[ENOTCONN] A receive is attempted on a connection-mode socket that is 
not connected.
[ENOTSOCK] The socket argument does not refer to a socket.
[EOPNOTSUPP] The specified flags are not supported for this socket type.
[ETIMEDOUT] The connection timed out during connection establishment, or 
due to a transmission timeout on active connection.
The recvmsg( ) function may fail if:
[EIO] An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file 
system.
[ENOBUFS] Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform 
the operation.
[ENOMEM] Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.
Since you didn't code to Linux, and didn't code to POSIX... what did you 
code to?

... unless the blocking changes.  In which case you either have to do 
work twice, or it might *never* happen.  Not to mention the extra code 
complexity.
The performance overhead of checksumming is substantial; I have seen 
some real horror examples of what happens when you do it badly.
