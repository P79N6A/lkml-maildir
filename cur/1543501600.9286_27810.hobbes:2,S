I'm not sure if it's possible on i386... I know the early p5-smp boxes
were very sensitive to even minor variations in processor.  I'm not
familiar enough with SMP intel hardware to know what the current generation
is capable of.
I have seen SMP sparc boxes with completely different processors in them
(maybe it's not technically "symmetric" at that point, but it does work)
Even if your API is i386 only then you should plan for the future when
it might be possible.
