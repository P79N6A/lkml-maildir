Something like this is definitly desirable. It would be a good idea
anyway to make the interface to the isdn hardware at the physical layer
more visible.
Maybe an isdn adapter should appear as a set of linux network
interfaces (one for the D-channel, and one for each B-channel) where
some device-specific ioctl()'s could be provided to control the physical
layer state. That way, the whole isdn protocol stack could access the
isdn hardware by the same manner as any other linux network protocol
(no longer a need for ugly or esotheric isdn-specific interfaces).
Doing so would provide the raw b-channel access as a by-product for free:
If the B-channel was exported as a linux network interface, you could read()
raw B-channel data from a SOCK_PACKET socket independently of the D-channel
Q.931 connection state.
