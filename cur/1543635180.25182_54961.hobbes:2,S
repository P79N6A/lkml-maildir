Do you mean "see lock contention", or "have the hardware to measure
lock contention"?  We probably use lockmeter more than just about 
anyone else.  But, I do not, nor have I ever contended, that things 
like driverfs's BKL use have a performance impact.  I just consider 
them messy, and bad practice.

I agree completely.  All of the maintainers who are handed data that 
shows bad BKL contention have either done something about it, or are 
doing something about it now.  2.5 is 2 orders of magnitude better 
than 2.4 for BKL contention in most of the workloads that I see.

I guess I got discouraged by a few non-responsive mailing lists in the 
past.  I'll make an effort to use them more in the future.
