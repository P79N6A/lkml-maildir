I have just tried to move to the 2.4.0-test11 kernel from the kernel
supplied with Redhat 7. With the Redhat 7 kernel I can see all the PCI slots
fine. However, when I try with the 2.4.0test11 it no longer seems to be able
to find some of the PCI buses. Is there something I can do to get the kernel
to see these PCI buses?
