I'm attempting to use the "stable" kernel-2.2.12 with knfsd-4.7.1 and
knfsd-lock-4.7.1mdk and its a mess.  Most of the problems seem
assosciated with nfs.  So far I've seen the following:
1.  The lockd process won't start - when I run rpc.lockd I get the
message "lockdsvc: invalid argument"
2.  Directories mounted with the automounter will just "go away",
usually in such a way that tasks referencing
     them hang.
3.   In some cases systems hung altogether, no cursor movement, no
rlogin, no nfs -  the only sign of life is
     that it responds to a ping.  In one case the system came back after
20 minutes with no known action on
     my part.
4.   Under RedHat 5.2, I could refer to filesystems mounted under root
directly (/net/system/home).  Under the
     new stuff this doesn't work.  If this is a design feature, its one
that causes real pain.
I would be glad to provide any debugging information, if you tell me
what you need.  NFS is a crucial part of my
environment and is now making my Linux systems less stable than my
NT stuff!
