Surely, but I've been desesperatly trying to find the cause w/out
success for months.
My first idea was that the BIOS doesn't set the CPU voltage properly at
boot, so I made up a patch that sets the right fid/vid before any
calibration but that didn't help.
The BIOS is wrong (ie the BIOS reports a 1/3 of the actual CPU speed),
memtest86+ which doesn't use any ACPI or whatever reports wrong time
too, so it's definitely not a Linux bug.
My guess is that Windows reinitialize some register but it's hard to
tell.
Cheers,
Olivier.
