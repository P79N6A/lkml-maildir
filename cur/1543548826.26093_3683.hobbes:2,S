Hi, all
Just have compiled 2.4.0-test8 today...
Nothing interesting
Everything goes the same way as 2 test releases before...
All my devices are detected right, but... :-(
Kernel panic again at the file systems mounting point.
Final error message, as I remember it, sounds like:
Error reading sector 0...  21:41 dev hdf1
or something like that
Sorry for disturbance but I'd like only to know
(from developers first of course :-)
if somebody going to heal it
or new kernel (future final release I mean)
will not support my hardware config by default? :-)
