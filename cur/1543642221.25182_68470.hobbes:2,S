Final update on this thread.
1. I fixed the busted DMA.  Full explanation of the bug and the
associated 2-line patch can be found in a separate message with subject
"[PATCH] 2.4.20-pre5-ac2: Promise Controller LBA48 DMA fixed".
2. The problem I saw with CDROM detection in 2.4.20-pre4-ac1 was PEBCAK.  
I had the cable backwards (host connector in the drive, master connector
in the controller).  2.4.19-ac4 doesn't seem to be sensitive to this.
3. Still no idea about the broken 80 pin cable detection - yes, I
double-checked the cable orientation :-)
