Yes, the vmap'ed area is reserved over the lifetime of the channel,
but the typical usage of a channel is transient - allocate it at the
start of say a tracing run, and then vunmap it and free the memory
when done.  Unless you're using huge buffers, you wouldn't run into a
problem running out of vmalloc space, and typical applications should
be able to use relatively small buffers.
I don't really know how we would get around using vmap - it seems like
the alternatives, such as managing an array of pages or something like
that, would slow down the logging path too much to make it useful as a
low overhead logging mechanism.  I you have any ideas though, please
let me know.
