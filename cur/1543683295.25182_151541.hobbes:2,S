My 'analysis' was indeed based on experience with sockets, where you
don't get the busy spin. It's indeed a bit baffling why select keeps
insisting that fd 1 is writable. A quick test on kernel versions
2.2.12-20, 2.4.20 and 2.6.0-test1 all give the same results, so I
suppose select itself is doing it's expected duty, and that in that case
the special underlying mechanics of stdout require special mechanics to
find out if it's blocked?! Beats me, but that's pretty easy... ;-)
