My notes show 0x5c reserved for additional apm_bios_info, although
of the top of my head I don't know how realistic that is.
0x1e4 does look available.
It has been a long time since I made that choice, and I do see that
looking at struct screen_info I did remember to document that I was
using 0x3c, even in your structure.
It is all internal to our boot process and external code isn't going
to use it so we can change it if we feel like.
