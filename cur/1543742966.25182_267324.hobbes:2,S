I did a nasty hack (I was just testing perf). I think Andy added another 
per-cpu queue, when he redid my stuff properly.

I really don't see much point in the COW'ed zeropage thing - it just
generates more minor faults. From the stuff I measured, I couldn't find
anything that read from an allocated page, and never wrote to it. I've
turned it off before, and just given them their own page straight away,
and it had no perf impact.

Yeah, fair enough. the only issue is that I think cold allocators could
steal hot pages the way you're doing it (ie if we set up a big DMA).

Yeah, that seems like a good thing to do ... except on machines with
big highmem, won't we exhaust ZONE_NORMAL much quicker?

Heh. If it's the same as what you posted before, I'll do a sniff test on
one of teh big boxes here.
