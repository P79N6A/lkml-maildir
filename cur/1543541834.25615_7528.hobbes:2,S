Yeah, I forgot to post that. :) I'm using 2.2.16 with a RAID patch I got
off of Red Hat's site. Shouldn't that work then? It doesn't. hehe
Apparently the patch isn't working or the RAID patch patched over
something that it wasn't supposed to. The NT machine is NT Server 4.0
with the 5.0 service pack. I can also tell you that smbclient reads the
'missing' directories just fine, but it's just th smbfs that I need to
work.
