All of my publicly released code is GPLv2. I just like it, but I don't
like the idea of taking someones else code and prohibiting him from
back-porting changes. On the other hand, you're probably just right,
I could've been decepted about the scale by the whining.

This is not my claim. I've just got an idea how to prevent future flame
wars, bad press and other disturbances created by such claims. For me,
the idea looks quite good as it does not cost really much and is the
only thing that we can really do. If even this little additional strain
on the maintainers seems too much, considering the scale of the problem
really is minute, then just forget about the whole thing.
But, on the end of the day, the whole thing remains a problem in my
eyes. BSD folks have explicitly agreed companies/organisations to not
give back. These have divided into those who do give back, and those who
don't. Having Linux community in the second category feels not so good.
However, the fact that in most(?) cases it is not so is relaxing.
