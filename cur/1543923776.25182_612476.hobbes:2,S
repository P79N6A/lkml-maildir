I think this is generally a good idea (to prevent slab allocators
from stealing reserve). However I naively think the implementation
is a bit overengineered and thus has a few holes.
Humour me, what was the problem with failing the slab allocation
(actually, not fail but just call into the page allocator to do
correct waiting  / reclaim) in the slowpath if the process fails the
watermark checks?
