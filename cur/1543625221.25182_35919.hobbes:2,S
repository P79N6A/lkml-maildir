Hi,
What exactly is the meaning of these 2 messages?
MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, correctable incident occured on CPU 0.
Bank 0: 1000000000000000
MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, correctable incident occured on CPU 0.
Bank 4: 2200000000000011
I get them right after boot and every 2 seconds
Is my CPU (it's an 3 year-old P-II 350 running 24/7) dying or what's up?
