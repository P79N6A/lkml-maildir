Sorry, some clarifications.

But it *IS* deadly slow.  A kernel compile took some 30 minutes, about
what it did on a Pentium 133.  Celeron 300A's (not overclocked, but in
a SCSI system) takes about 4 minutes, with the same board and the old
PPro200/512's about 5 minutes.  With PII/400's a little < 3 mins., so...
The other thing that made me uneasy was that there is line in phoenix
BIOS bootup process which says `Processor Patch failed'.  But that's
all that seemed unusual ...
