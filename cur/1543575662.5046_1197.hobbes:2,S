Unlikely. Many people use that particular mouse with your particular HCD
in SMP every day. Like myself. In fact I am right now, using 2.2.18.
What is more likely the cause is an IRQ routing problem.
Can you check /proc/interrupts and see if the interrupt count is going
up?
Also, can you check your BIOS and see if it is configured for MPS 1.4?
If so, change it to MPS 1.1.
