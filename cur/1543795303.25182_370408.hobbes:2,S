When playing a DVD movie (xine), I get hundreds of these
messages from the kernel, flooding my syslogs:
sr0: CDROM not ready.  Make sure there is a disc in the drive.
sr0: CDROM not ready.  Make sure there is a disc in the drive.

The kernel probably doesn't need to be issuing these,
but rather it should leave it up to the application
to report/log drive conditions like this.
