can you test it with ac6? ac7 incorpates an incredibly simple patch to
fix poor scrolling in ac4-ac6.  i cant see how this could break
anything.
i am running ac7 right now (and was running ac6 with the patch) and my
IntelliMouse works fine.
I am using the USB HID driver, not the limited mouse-only driver.
