After reading the MPC885 RM datasheet, I think the device supports
repeated start. I guess that you simply need to _only_ set the
BD_SC_LAST flag for the last message of the transaction, not all of
them as the driver does. If I am correct, this should be fairly easy to
fix. Please try, test and report.

No, if you think it's reasonable, fine with me.
