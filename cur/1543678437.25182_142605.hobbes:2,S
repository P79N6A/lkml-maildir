I agree 100%... So this leads us to having two different set of
scheduler policies: for desktop usage, and for server usage. For desktop
usage, most of the apps need CPU bursts for a bried period of time. For
server usage, we want a more steady scheduling plan.

So, opaque window moving is also a waste of time and we'd better stick
to border-only (transparent) window moving ;-)
Nah! I also think it'a waste of time, but Joe-end-user won't think the
same. He'll have a better feeling using more CPU to refresh the screen
at a faster rate, even when that's a waste of CPU cycles. Look at
Windows or Mac with all those nice, CPU-wasting visual effects.

What would happen with poorly written programs? There are a lot of them
that don't take advantage of memory locality, are not designed to fully
utilize the cache, or use arrays in a way that produces too much
page/cache faults.
