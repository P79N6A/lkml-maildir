I don't think of swsusp as suspend1 - in my mind, Suspend1 was the version I 
released before suspend2 :). That said, I obviously know what you mean. It 
should work - they're basically the same. The main difference that would make 
Suspend2 work for you would be that I've sometimes included the odd driver 
fix in the suspend2 patch to save people having to go searching, and have (my 
bad) been too slow at pushing them upstream.
Regards,
Nigel
