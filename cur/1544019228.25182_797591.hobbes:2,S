okay - that was the general thinking and this went through a few 
iterations already - not enough it appears. The CONFIG_* thing was 
something that looked somewhat dubious to me too - changing it to those 
random __foo symbols didnt seem like an improvement.
Jaswider, would you mind re-doing the tree filtering out the CONFIG_* 
changes? I'll go over the end result once more to make sure it has no 
changes that make the code look worse.
I still think what i expressed elsewhere in these threads on lkml: 
'exporting' 75,000 lines of random kernel headers to user-space is really 
stretching the term - kernel-space is unaware of it in 90% of the cases. 
"spilling our guts to user-space" would be a more fair description.
It would be much better if we exported _much_ less and reduced our 
cross-section to user-space. Also, the include/linux/Kbuild rules are all 
but transparent: it would also be nice if whatever we exported was be 
visible straight in the header itself, to make it obvious to people who 
modify/extend those files that those definitions are going to be exported 
to user-space.
Some __user_export tag on structures perhaps? I have no good ideas here - 
#ifdefs are ugly and tags obscure the purity of the code.
