Is there an easy way to tell which routines must be re-entrant? 
(it doesn't have to be exhaustive, even an incomplete set is useful)
I was going to write a checker to make sure supposedly re-entrant
routines actually were, but was having a hard time figuring out which
ones were supposed to be...
Thanks,
Dawson
