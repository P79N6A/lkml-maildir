First it can be relatively slow on P4s (hundreds of cycles) 
On other systems it can run with different frequencies on different CPUs,
so you never need to assume a timestamp from one CPU is comparable with
the one from other CPUs (the scheduler carefully avoids this)
If you need a stable timestamp over multiple CPUs don't use it.
In general do_gettimeofday is much safer.
do_gettimeofday shouldn't be that much slower for the case where TSC
works, and where it doesn't there is no other alternative.
