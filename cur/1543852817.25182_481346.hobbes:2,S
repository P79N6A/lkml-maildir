I have been trying to run with this patch. We increase the min interval so 
that we can at least put one tick between each of the load balance actions 
of each processor. The cpu_offset can be modified to:
/* Don't have all balancing operations going off at once: */
static inline unsigned long cpu_offset(int cpu)
{
	if (NR_CPUS < HZ)
    		return jiffies + cpu * HZ / NR_CPUS;
	else
		return jiffies + cpu;
}
But exclusion in load balancing would take care of the above.
