the latter is not a self contained patch unfortunately (it could be in
theory but it isn't in practice), and there's no way I can invest effort
in 2.4 to extract it now (infact I need to check that 2.6 addresses that
instead). But you can find it in the 05_vm_26-rest-1 patch.  Ideally if
you apply all the 05_vm_* and the inode-highmem (solving possible
rejects, or applying only the patch with dependencies), you should be
fine then.

Just to try the driver you can go with plain 2.4.23 right now, the inode
and bh troubles showup in a few days normally, not in a few minutes,
however it depends on your workload. For example with 12G you probably
want to avoid updatedb until you apply all the vm fixes.
