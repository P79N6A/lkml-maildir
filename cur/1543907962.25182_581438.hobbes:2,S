Hi All,
    We are running vanilla 2.6.22 linux kernel in i.MX 21 lite kit,
patched for our board and utilizing the generic touchscreen driver
drivers/input/touchscreen/ads7846.c for our touch screen. We have
changed the register values in spi_imx.c for i.MX21. The code seems to
run but we are not getting correct values for the touchscreen
positions. The SPI registers always return a value of 4096. We have
checked for correct clock. But still it does not help.
   Has anybody faced a similar problem before?
Thanks,
Midhun.
