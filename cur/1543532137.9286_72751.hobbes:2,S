You are completely neglecting that the signals are not coming alone:
- there is a signal context.  If the process which receives the signal
  first (mainly the manager) simply returns the signal context on its
  stack is lost.
  Copying it means garbage collection of some kind
- you have to handle certain signal special (segfault, stop/continue).
  Especially the later contains the possibility for arbitrary many
  races if not done in the kernel.
- RT signals have to transport data which, again, can be in the signal stack.
- sigaltstack must continue to work
I'm cutting it short here.
