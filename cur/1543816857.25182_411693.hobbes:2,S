Sorry for making misunderstanding.
What I wanted to say with "2" (use Xen as a tool) is, probably same as
what you are guessing now.
I mean, you make a server like this.
1. Install jailed Linux(OpenVZ/Vserver/or..) on Xen
2. make only one domU. and many VMs on this domU with jail.
3. runs many (more than 100 or...) VMs with jail, not with Xen.
4. but, for example, you want to migrate to another PC,
   use Xen live migration.
The fourth point would help administration tasks easier. This is the point
where I mentioned about "better tool".
There is other usage of Xen as admin tool. For example, if you need device
driver (e.g. new iSCSI H/W driver or gigabit ether or...) of 2.6 kernel, but
no need to use any other 2.6 funcs, keep guest OS (domU) as 2.4, and make
dom0 as 2.6 Xen.  This also helps admin tasks.
Probably, the biggest problem for now is, Xen patch conflicts with
Vserver/OpenVZ patch.
