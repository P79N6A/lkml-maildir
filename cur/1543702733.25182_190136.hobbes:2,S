Actually, on one of the boxes it doesn't seem to be working at all:
activating NMI Watchdog ... done.
testing NMI watchdog ... CPU#0: NMI appears to be stuck!  
This is on a Tyan Dual AMD MPX board with two MP 2000+ CPUs. 
/proc/interrupts shows:

I'll try reenabling it on the other (Intel) boxes where I think it
actually does work, and see if anything results.

I'll do the serial console dance next time and get some sysrq-T output.
