As long as your modules are trivial, you are correct. I agree that writing 
a basic module is fairly easy, and debugging is easy (although if they 
fixed the printk interface it would be easier), but.....
"compliance" is difficult without good documentation,and unfortunately most 
of the docs for the linux kernel are in Alan Cox's head (and the like). 
Virtually all books are out of date by the time they hit the shelves (the 
linux "device driver" book had many errors and omissions and proved more 
detrimental than useful). Most of the how-tos are out of date. This, 
understandable, is what you get for free.
Also, the definition of "compliant" keeps changing.  the difference between 
a real commercial OS and linux is that linux is a moving target.
While they might brag about LINUX being "fast moving", it is also the main 
reason that it is continuously unstable and the  hopes of true stability 
any time soon is questionable. Until they stop hacking core elements and 
redesigning interfaces on the fly there will be no change. Just lots of new 
features that almost work as long as you use them in a particular way.
theres a lot to be said for doing something right the first time and 
sticking with it even if it isnt perfect. Unfortunately many of the 
original linux designs were so poorly thought out that they need to be 
completely redesigned.
