Why, then, does this driver do such a nice hack as:
        /* special op: write back the misordered MAC address - otherwise
         * the next nv_probe would see a wrong address.
         */
        writel(np->orig_mac[0], base + NvRegMacAddrA);
        writel(np->orig_mac[1], base + NvRegMacAddrB);
I really don't see why this driver needs to do these things in such a
messy way.
One thing is for certain: netdev->dev_addr is always in operating system
order, and order should always be handled properly when copying to/from
hardware.
Such a driver needs exactly *one* central helper method
to reverse an input MAC address in 6 bytes u8 format
(which could arguably be added to include/linux/etherdevice.h even,
since a wee bit too many devices seem to be having trouble
with wrongly ordered MAC addresses).
Then it needs exactly *one* function for I/O register access
to read a MAC address from a device and exactly *one* function
to write it back (both doing raw, unsorted format transfers only,
and possibly as inline function).
And then it needs these card I/O functions wrapped into two functions which
interface with driver- and OS-related MAC variables
(struct variables ALWAYS stored in usual system order, NOT H/W order!!!!!!)
which optionally reverse the address (if needed for a particular card).
And then there will never be any confusion about any MAC address format
anywhere any more, right?
I really don't mean to sound cranky, but this driver did ask for trouble,
and lots of it ;)
Thank you for your reply, and especially thank you for this very fast
patch!
I might even have enough time this weekend to work on this...
