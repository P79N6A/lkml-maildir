Uh-oh.  Someone has set the `full duplex' bit in your
EEPROM.  Bit 15, word 0x0d.

heh.  The driver lies.

But vortex-diag doesn't.  You're running full-duplex.

And here is why - it's that EEPROM bit.

You need to clear that bit - then the driver will run half-duplex.
If you have the 3com DOS-based config tool you can probably do
it with that.  Alternatively, see if you can get vortex-diag
(
http://www.scyld.com/diag/
) to do it - I find vortex-diag's
EEPROM writing a bit tricky to use.  So be careful to save the
output of `vortex-diag -ee' as a backup first.
You can probably kludge it in the driver with:
    /* Extract our information from the EEPROM data. */
    vp->info1 = eeprom[13];
+   vp->info1 &= ~0x8000;
    vp->info2 = eeprom[15];
Working out why your switch isn't talking full-duplex would
probably make things work too, but it's not a fix.
