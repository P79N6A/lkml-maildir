Please, correct some mistakes:
- old ISA PnP code does not require user space tools, too
- the new code is mostly based on idea to make behaviour same as for PCI 
  devices (probe, remove etc. callbacks) and to merge the PnP BIOS 
  access code
- maintaince? the code was nearly complete, almost all device drivers were 
  converted to support ISA PnP (thus autoconfiguration which has moved to 
  the new PnP layer); I don't know what you mean that the code is more 
  actively maintained; it was maintained to satisfy my goals
