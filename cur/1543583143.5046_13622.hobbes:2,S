I have just purchased a new HD and I'm getting problems creating a
filesystem for it. I've done some research and some people claim the problem
might be kernel related so I'm asking here just in case.
The HD is a Maxtor 80 Gb, plugged to the Promise controller that comes with
Asus A7V motherboards. The controller is ide2, and the HD is /dev/hde. ide0
and ide1 are working with no problems.
-----------------
fdisk shows some warnings (but doesn't refuse to create the partition):
[root@alhambra /sbin]# fdisk /dev/hde
Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF
disklabel
Building a new DOS disklabel. Changes will remain in memory only,
until you decide to write them. After that, of course, the previous
content won't be recoverable.
The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 15871.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)

When trying to create the filesystem, I get this:
[root@alhambra /sbin]# ./mke2fs /dev/hde1

Any suggestion?
