Or if the caller may wish to keep interrupts disabled.

If those functions are always called with interrupts enabled then
no, you're not missing anything ;)
However a bare spin_unlock_irq() in a function means that
callers which wish to keep interrupts disabled are subtly
subverted.   We've had bugs from this before.
So the irqrestore functions are much more robust.  I believe
that they should be the default choice.  The non-restore
versions should be viewed as a micro-optimised version,
to be used with caution.  The additional expense of the save/restore
is quite tiny - 20-30 cycles, perhaps.
