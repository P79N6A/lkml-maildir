Boots up to multiuser mostly OK.  However...
It comes up with a screaming ksoftirqd - usually /1 but one boot had /0.
Just sitting there, 100% CPU according to 'top'.  Tried 'echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger' to get
a trace, but it was always running on the other CPU - even after I reniced
it down to 19 and launched 2 'for(;;)' C programs to suck the cycles.  It would
be failing to get any CPU - until I did the 'echo t' and then it would be
"running" again.  Anybody got any good debugging ideas here?
Oddly enough, the kernel panic I was seeing at X server shutdown, related to
-x86_64-mm-reloc64-__pa-and-__pa_symbol-address-space-separation.patch,
seems to be gone now (not extensively tested - but it did survive one shutdown
without crashing at a point that *had* been a 100% fatal from -rc5-mm3 to 21-mm1.
I wish I understood why.
Replicated with a boot to single-user and an untainted kernel - by that point,
it was spinning at 100% already.
Any ideas how to debug this one?
