I have a similar patch at...
  
http://members.optushome.com.au/cefiar1/sis_vesa_fb_hack.diff
..which does the same, except you need to add...
Option  "VesaFBHack" "true"
..to the Drivers section of your XF86Config-4 file to enable it.
Got a binary as well, search the XFree86 Xpert list if you want more info.
If the kernel SiS FrameBuffer driver is fixed first, this way will still 
work, and maybe a more decent XFree86 patch could use the FrameBuffer mode 
sets and so on to change modes, till the XFree86 driver is fixed, and 
providing such info to the XFree86 team to fix the bug there as well. I 
have yet to hear anything from SiS (and a few SiS employees are on l-k as 
well as Xpert) on what they think this could be, or about up-to-date docs.
