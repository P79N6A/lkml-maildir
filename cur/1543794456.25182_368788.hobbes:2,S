Update, I may be sticking my finger in the dike and hollering wolf or
however that old saw goes.  I've now rebooted to 3 kernels where tvtime
was known to work, but it doesn't.  Turning off the signal detection
shows that all I'm getting is some sort of digital noise.  So its time
to drag in another receiver and see if its the DISH convertor or my
pcHDTV-3000.
More later when I've done that.
