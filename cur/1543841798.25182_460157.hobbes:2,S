Yeh.... I was looking at  linear_issue_flush, which aborts when
ret == 0, and dm_table_any_congested, which 'or's together the results
and combining to two.  And I kept changing my mind as to which way I
wanted to go for linear_congested et.al, and ended up going both ways
:-(
I hate indecision.  I think.  Well, probably I do.  Maybe.
