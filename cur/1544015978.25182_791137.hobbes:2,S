This started happening with Linus's pull from today for
sparc64 allmodconfig:
ERROR: "__set_irq_handler" [drivers/mfd/pcf50633-core.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "handle_level_irq" [drivers/mfd/pcf50633-core.ko] undefined!
Sure we can export __set_irq_handler() and handle_level_irq() to
modules to fix this, but that looks like some hokey stuff for
a MFD driver to be doing :-)
