While looking at some other irq issues I realized that the current msi code
has a serious issue in that we don't have support for masking msi interrupts
on all variations of the msi capabilities.
Closing that hole is simple, but it requires the msi enable/disable
logic to be sorted out. Which is a little more complicated...
These are moderately simples fixes so the should be safe for 2.6.21.
