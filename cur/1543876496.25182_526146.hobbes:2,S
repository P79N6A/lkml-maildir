What you actually get is how many ns the CPU spent in each state.

It just seems like a simpler interface to just allow overriding
sched_clock, rather than exposing sched_clock's internals and fiddling
with those.  There's really nothing in the existing sched_clock which
can be profitably reused in the Xen case.  VMI can make use of the
cycles_2_ns conversion, which is why I made it available for its use.
To be specific, this is the whole Xen sched_clock function:
/* Xen sched_clock implementation.  Returns the number of RUNNING ns */
unsigned long long xen_sched_clock(void)
{
	struct vcpu_runstate_info state;
	cycle_t now;
	unsigned long long ret;
	preempt_disable();
	now = xen_clocksource_read();
	get_runstate_snapshot(&state);
	WARN_ON(state.state != RUNSTATE_running);
	ret = state.time[RUNSTATE_running] + (now - state.state_entry_time);
	preempt_enable();
	return ret;
}
