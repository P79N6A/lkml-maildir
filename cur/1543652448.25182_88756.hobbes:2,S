Use /dev/discs if that's what you like.  The /dev/ide/hostN...
alternative is there for a reason though.
If you have, say 3 ide controllers and remove a disk
from the second one then disks on the third is renumbered 
if they're in /dev/discs.  The ones in /dev/ide/host2/...
stays put.
Desktop machines may not need all that with one disk only,
but it is useful for servers using IDE drives.
