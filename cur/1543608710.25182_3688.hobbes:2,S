Ehh...  Slow growth can involve a _lot_ of IO and file creation/removal,
just no directory tree changes.

Take a look at the allocator for non-directory inodes.

find(1).  Stuff that runs every damn night.  We end up doing getdents() +
bunch of lstat() on the entries we had found.  And that means access to
inodes refered from them.  Try that on a large directory with child
inodes spread all over the disk.
Linus, I'm not saying that fast-growth scenario doesn't need to be handled
or that 5 times slowdown on cvs co is OK.  We need a decent heuristics to
distinguish between the slow and fast variants.  BTW, the problem is not
new or Linux-specific.  IIRC, there was a couple of papers by folks who
gathered real-life traces of allocations/freeing of objects on different
boxen and had ran them through several allocators.  I'll try to locate that
stuff and see if we can get to their raw data.  OK?  I'd really like to
have something beyond "current allocator sucks for fast-growth" to deal
with - especially if we start inventing heuristics for switching between
the fast and slow modes.
