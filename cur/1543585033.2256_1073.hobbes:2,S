I suggest using the 82686-based controller rather than the HPT one.  Also,
try running with DMA mode disabled.  Personally, I'm running fine with the
82686-based controller in DMA mode with a Seagate UDMA/66 drive.  You might
also want to look at the BIOS settings, which Windows drivers might
"adjust" at runtime to saner values.
