Sure (I argued that in a earlier mail in fact), but it doesn't make
sense to fake into the old slabinfo format.

While I sympatise with this point in practice non critial ABIs change
regularly (and sometimes even critical ones like sched_yield ...)

Removing an interface that exposes lots of internal details when you
rewrite the subsystem and those internal details all change seems
like a good reason to me.
Besides the original interface was broken anyways. The version
number was one of the interface worst ideas ever imho and slabtop's handling 
of it quite dumb. The better way would have been to always add new 
fields and never remove old ones. Hopefully the new /sys based interface
will be better.
