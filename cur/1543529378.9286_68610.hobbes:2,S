Seems that it wants to do it randomly while the system is booted.  No
errors.  The mouse was working after loading pci_socket and starting up
cardmgr.  Then all of a sudden, the mouse was no longer functional.  After
trying to use the mouse, the keyboard no longer worked until gpm was
stopped.
i know for a fact that after a few minutes (seems random) yenta_init() is
called again.
