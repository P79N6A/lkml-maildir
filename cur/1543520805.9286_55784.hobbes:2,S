   Youre talking about stackguard right? I guess the problem here is that
   noone has ported stackguard to egcs yet. Would be nice though.
No, I wasn't talking just about stackguard; other techniques do exist:
	* arranging so that the stack pointer contains a 0x00 byte to
		make it harder for null-terminated strings to be used to
		write a valid return address	
	* at program start time, randomly changing the starting point of
		the stack by a few hundred kilbytes.  (Since the starting
		location is changing randomly for every program
		invocation, guesses based on one process doesn't help
		eliminate possible guesses on another process.)
	* have libc do stack frame analysis, and then have certain
		functions (sprintf, memcpy, strcpy, etc.) not allow
		operations which overwrite stack frame boundaries.
Both stackguard and the last option requires some CPU overhead at
run-time; the first two don't require any overhead at all.  Note that
some of approaches, such as changing the stack location randomly will
stop certain attacks that the Solar Designer patch won't catch.
