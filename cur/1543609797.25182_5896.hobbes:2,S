Subject: constants for goodness calculation

I wonder if we can make the following change in the goodness code for the
following 2 reasons.
(1) It would be more consistent with PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY in regarding to
goodness calculation.
(2) It would be easier to tweak these two constants in architecture
dependent code instead of generic code. The constants varies a lot from
platform to platform and instead of one constant for all platform, it is
easier for each platform to tailor optimal number in architecture code.
Any comments or objection?  If no, then I will generate a patch set to
include changes for all platforms.  One other question, what is the standard
procedure to send patch to Linus or Alan for consideration?  Thanks.
