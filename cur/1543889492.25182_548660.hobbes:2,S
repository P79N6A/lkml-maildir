FWIW,
With the asix.c driver, you can't just add the USB IDs and have it work.
Each ID also needs to be told which driver structure to use, since the
driver itself supports three similar, but distinct chips.  Adding the
IDs to the driver itself is naturally trivial, but adding via sysfs or
the like doesn't work.  I would imagine that there are other drivers
that operate quite similarly.
