I dont speak for the kernel people, but...
I suppose some people just insist on squeezing every last cycle out of
their machines.  For my home PC (a 486 with 5MB RAM running linux 2.0.30),
I am quite grateful for such cycle and bit saving.  Believe me, I notice
whether I have apache running or not. :)
Hmm, yes, it does seem to be just one word.  grep -r spinlock_t . |wc -l
says 1013 here, that's across *all* architectures.  IOW 4052 bytes - that's
*one page* - on i386!
Never mind what definition tcc will give to __GNUC__
So there I thought I was going to justify the kernel.  Instead I mostly
agree with Joe!  I'm also sure there have been flamewars about this...

Between GCC 2.x and 3.x the *major* version changed (duh).  I would
imagine that people are/were (justifiably?) concerned that ABI's might
have changed.  From your response, I assume there are no ABI changes
for C at least?  I suppose a gratuitous ABI change would constitute a
bug, though...
BTW I said "I thought" - it appears there is in fact no such mechanism.
Okay, so here's a PR (Public Relations, not Problem Report) patch just
for you, Joe:     <with a fistful of smileys :)>
(It also gets rid of some of that crazy 2-space indentation.)
