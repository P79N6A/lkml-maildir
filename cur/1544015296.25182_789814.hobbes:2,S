Hi Ted,
I just ported LTTng to 2.6.28 yesterday and started doing the port of
ext4/jbd2 to tracepoints. As you can see in my 0.74 announcement, the
tracepoint work for both jbd2 and ext4 is done. I also did the lttng
probe module for jbd2. Now I just have to create the probe module for
ext4. I also want to create debugfs files to control per-probe module
filtering, e.g. :
/mnt/debugfs/ltt/filter/jbd2/dev
/mnt/debugfs/ltt/filter/ext4/dev
Where writing to it would add device names to the filter list. I would
like a scheme where we can easily add/remove devices, list all
devices... I think ftrace already has something similar for
instrumentation activation.
The main question I am facing is : What interface semantic do we want
for such filter control file ?
Comments/ideas are welcome.
