I think you are mixing 2 stories. According to my sources, the driver
of a Renault Vel Satis reported a similar issue and got stuck at
around 190kmph during an hour in October 2004. In March 2005, the
driver of a Laguna reported that he got stuck at 90 kmph for 40km.

To my knowledge, none of the reported issues have yet been identified
as coming from the car. I searched again before posting and found no
reference to that issue.
I would be happy to know where you found this information. At least to
know if the constructors are hidding something.
