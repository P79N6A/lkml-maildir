OTOH we do have a pile of user reports which
say the low latency patches give better results.
 From my view here, low latency provides a more
silky feel when e.g. playing RtCW or Q3A -
BTW I have checked out 2.4.18pre2-aa2 and
am now running 2.4.18-pre3 + mini low latency.
* -aa absolutely kicks major booty in benchmarks.
* -mini-low-latency seems to do no worse than
stock kernel benchmark-wise, but seems to be
somehow smoother. I played some mp3s while
running dbench 16 and heard no hitches. Also
the RtCW test was successful, e.g. movement
was fluid and I was victorious in most skirmishes
with win32 opponents.
