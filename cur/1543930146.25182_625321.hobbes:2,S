the bisection log looks healthy so far - with nicely alternating 
good/bad bisection points. Barring the possibility that the bug is 
non-deterministic, i'd guess the bisection points are OK, at least 
judging from their statistical properties.
but ... i went over the diffs too, and i fail to see how they could 
affect the bootup path of an Alpha box, which i suspect has no 
networking dependency up to the failure point.
