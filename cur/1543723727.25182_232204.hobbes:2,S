that's a nice effort, I agree prio_tree.c is better suited for lib/ than
mm/ but the code already looks quite generic and well written.

why don't you move the shared code to lib/prio_tree.c instead of
duplicating it in every object?
prio_tree_insert/prio_tree_remove/prio_tree_replace needs to be
exported etc..

I thought prio_tree_next was already the equivalent of rb_next for
prio-trees. The API is slightly different because you need an iterator
object, but I'm not sure how you want to change it to make it more
symmetric with rb_next.
