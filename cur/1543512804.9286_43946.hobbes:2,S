I wrote this patch a couple months ago (you may have seen my recent post
describing it). It was a side-effect of the major piece of my patch, which
allows minors to conveniently subclass majors without having a big nasty
switch statement. Look at drivers/char/mem.c or drivers/char/misc.c for an
example.
I realized when I'd finished this that resource trees were an even better
way to go. It allows us to say things like major x minors a-b use these
fileops while major x minors c-d use these other fileops. It also allows
register_device to be _much_ smarter about how it allocates things - you
can say "please give me a whole major", "please give me 8 minors", any
granularity you'd like. The divide between majors and minors becomes a
continuum. Think of it as CIDR for device space.
