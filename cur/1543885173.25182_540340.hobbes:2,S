Indeed, I haven't seen that. For ET_DYN executables, it could be done a
thing like load_addr+elf_ppnt->p_vaddr (in the function that creates the
auxv, as ity has access to the elf header), and for ET_EXEC do what I
propose. I think this is trivial to do. I'll do it as soon as I come back
in front of my machine.

I don't understand. Yes it is what it is supposed to be, and the kernel
is supposed to give the vaddr of the phdr table to the interpreter and
not load addr + offset of phdr in file, which is sometimes wrong.
