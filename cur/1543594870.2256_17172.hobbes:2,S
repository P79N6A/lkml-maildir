	Theoretically, pretty much everything you can do with a thread pool
architecture can be done with a process pool architecture. Sharing file
descriptors can be much harder. Some thread architectures (notably pthreads)
go out of their way to make some things hard for thread pools (like try
implementing Samba, since all the threads share there uids). But this is
more about bad threading specifications and implementations than threading
itself.

	I'll flip this back at you and ask you what's gained by using processes
over threads. It's certainly more difficult to implement a process pool
architecture than a thread pool architecture. Theoretically, performance for
a thread pool architecture will be slightly better (on some architectures at
least) due to the identical vm views.
	With a process pool architecture, you might have more control over what you
share. But this doesn't actually gain you anything because as long as you
share more than a small amount, you still have to consider your entire
environment tainted if one execution vehicle goes out of control.
	I would be very interested in seeing, for example, a web server based on a
'process pool' design. Does anybody know of any?
