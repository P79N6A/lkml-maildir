Sorry - I mentioned it in an earlier post with a different subject. It's
plain 2.4.21.

It is 0, yes. May it be caused by the following lines in pdc202xx_old.c?
        if (hwif->pci_dev->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20265)
                hwif->addressing = (hwif->channel) ? 0 : 1;

I know. But it's mounted read only, and to be sure I tried it without
mounting the file system, as well. 
But the most important prove that it's not a fs problem is that writing
to one partition changed contents of a different partition.
