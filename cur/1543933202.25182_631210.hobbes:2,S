Right. thanks.  Sorry for the noise.
Should the makefiles for the sources that include lib/inflate.c
have a dependency similar to arm and alpha?
With:
arch/alpha/boot/misc.c
arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c
Without:
arch/cris/arch-v10/boot/compressed/misc.c
arch/cris/arch-v32/boot/compressed/misc.c
arch/h8300/boot/compressed/misc.c
arch/m32r/boot/compressed/misc.c
arch/sh/boot/compressed/misc.c
arch/sh64/boot/compressed/misc.c
arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc_32.c
