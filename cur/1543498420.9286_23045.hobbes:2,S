I agree with what you're saying, but have one other motivation for
removing the harsher words, f*ck for example:
It is possible that this will cause the kernel to be blocked by censoring
software.  Or parts of the kernel.  Or patches, etc.
I don't think anyone should make the owners of a subsection clean up their
comments and such, but I would like to encourage them to remove the worst
words.
I understand that putting in such comments at 4am make one feel better,
but hopefully after a good bit of sleep, it doesn't seem terribly useful.
Ciao!
