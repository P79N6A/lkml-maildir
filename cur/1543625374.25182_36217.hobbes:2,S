Actually not. Have a look at page 36 of the current ATA6 specification.

If a disk is in power state PM1:idle or PM2:standby, each ATA command
which requires media access will result in a transition to power state
PM0:active as well. The driver should be prepared of a long command
execution time in this case (due to the spin up delay). This is why a
well implemented ATA driver should track the individual power states of
each attached unit to modulate its internal command timeout
accordingly.
The driver may issue a SET_FEATURES(spin up) command in anticipation of
a media access. A "forgiving" implementation might issue this command
at proper system state transitions as well .
If a disk has entered power state PM3:sleep, its interface is turned
off! You no longer can issue any command except for a DEVICE RESET to
this unit. A reset is required to initiate a state transition from
PM3:sleep to PM2:standby (there are no other state transitions).
