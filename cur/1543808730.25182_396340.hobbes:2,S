 From the simple perspective, yes, that's the only difference.  On  
the other hand, from an efficiency standpoint, they are _completely_  
different, to a degree that the OS needs to treat them as such or  
performance will suck.  Software suspend (to disk, network, file,  
etc) _requires_ a copy; it's completely mandatory because RAM is  
guaranteed to go away.  It freezes everything, checkpoints the kernel  
with a lot of really complex and oft-buggy code, unfreezes things,  
stores data, and shuts off.  Hardware suspend (to RAM only)  
implicitly needs no copy.  The CPU and memory architecture itself  
supports the low-power state, so you don't have to do much of  
anything special about kernel or userspace threads, you just have to  
suspend the device tree once (already exists for per-device power  
management) and then tell the firmware to finish up.  The former is O 
(memory), the latter is O(1).
For a significant majority of people, hardware suspend is  
significantly better.  I never understood why people need graphical  
splash screens during suspend/resume... until I tried software- 
suspend.  With hardware-suspend, I close it, 2 seconds later the  
little white light on the front comes on and it's sleeping, I open  
it, 2 seconds later it's connected to wireless again and ready to  
use.  With software-suspend, it just _doesn't_ work that fast because  
of the inherent way it does things; hard disks on laptops are _slow_.

It depends on the hardware.  For the disk case, yes, this is true.   
On the other hand, for hardware-suspend a number of devices like  
keyboards and mice may still be in a low-power suspend mode, allowing  
you to wake the computer by pushing keys or mouse buttons.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.  The first method is far more difficult.
