I do think the locking is broken in your patch.
Since you release the tasklist lock, the children on our list of children 
might go away while you released the lock, making the
	list_for_each_safe(..)
thing unsafe - the next entry in the list (that we have cached in "next") 
may have gone away, resulting in us using a stale pointer when we re-start 
the loop after re-aquiring the lock.
HOWEVER, I think you can fix it with something like
	_n = father->children.next;
after you've re-aquired the lock (that will re-start the loop, but since 
we should have gotten rid of all the previous entries, the "restart" is 
actually going to just continue at the point where we were going to 
continue anyway, so it shouldn't cause any extra iterations).
Does that still work for you, or have I totally messed up?
I do agree with Andrea that it's ugly, and my patch just makes it uglier 
still. I wonder if there is some cleaner way to do the same thing.
