Should be cheaper to buy a bigger case with a *real airflow path, and
remove some of those fans. It's non-sense to put 10 fans in a mono-proc
system ! even with 6 disks (probably even IDE disks).
BTW, if you have the case FAN orthogonal to the CPU's and close to it,
you'd better stop it as ot will prevent part of the airflow from entering
the CPU's fan. It's amazing to see the number of boxes with a case FAN
which increases the CPU temperature by 5 degrees once it spins up ! I
too had one which made my dual athlon regularly crash, and it's OK now
that I have unplugged it. I noticed it first because the rear CPU was
5 degrees hotter than the front one.

If your system is stable, you can also disable the alarm. It's very
conservative and will beep for nearly nothing. My dual athlon runs
up to 92 degrees celcius on summer without crashing. The highest alarm
threshold was something like 60 degrees...
