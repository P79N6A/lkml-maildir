I'm also happy with 4.5 (4.50). Never trusted 4.0anything. But when I first
got it I couldn't keep it up for more than a minute or two - opening mail
window meant instant death. I soon found that it didn't like 4.0's
idea of preferences and/or cache layout. Just get rid of the old and start
again (I also run 3.0gold to clean out corrupted stuff). The result
is stability - but yes, I have seen other peoples netscapes dying every 5
mins.
kernel 2.0.25-36, libc 5.4.38-46, ld.so 1.9.5. Watch out for ld.so
with higher numbers, which I have found to do bad things to some
convoluted things like java workshop.
