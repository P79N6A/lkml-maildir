<P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">I would like to modify the kernel of my Redhat 6.0 box so that it ignores reset packets.&nbsp; I realize that this is a very unusual configuration, but it is necessary for me.&nbsp; I would also like a mechanism for either resetting all of the connections, or resetting the oldest ones if there are no more openings.&nbsp; The point is that I need a setup that does not allow the connections to be reset by a spoofed packet, but obviously, I must have some mechanism for resetting them myself.</FONT></P>
