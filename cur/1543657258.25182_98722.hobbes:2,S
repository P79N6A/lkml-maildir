Subject: [TRIVIAL 2.2] tulip.c: gracefully handle init_ertherdev failure

Alan,
Appended patch to tulip.c (against 2.2.24-rc1) gracefully handles the case
where init_etherdev() fails.  In the modular case, this would otherwise
lead to an oops at module load time and the tulip module listed as wedged
half-loaded.
This patch has, so far, only been tested as far as compiling.  IMVHO
this patch is "TRIVIAL" and its correctness appears "obvious" - so will
verification that it still loads and operates happily be sufficient
testing?
FWIW, 2.4 already handles this case gracefully.
Thanks,
Neale.
