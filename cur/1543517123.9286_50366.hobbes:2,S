I am.
I'm trying to recieve (at least well enough to learn, possibly not well
enough to recieve from a distance) standard TV/video remote controll signals,
through the uart that's connected to all IRDA ports.
On a few, this uart can also do direct reception, but not on all (or 
even a majority, or more importantly, my hardware).
The data is in the form of a 40Khz squarewave, pulsed on and off to signal.
When this is recieved by the UART, connected to an IR reciever, it 
recieves various characters, (A single keypress generates around 500
bytes, at 115200 (N81), some framing errors, mostly [#' "] )
If these data bytes arrival are timed, then the original pulsed squarewave
can be reconstructed.
Ideally, the timing would be under 10us or so, as this would let the
phase of the 40Khz signal be tracked, enhancing reliability.
It must certainly be under .5ms, as much more will degrade the signals
readability.
I need times for each byte, so the fifo can't be used, but on the other
hand, if a few percent of the chars get lost, it's not a big problem.
I want this to be useable.
Unfortunately, there is no portable way of (on a 16550, or similar) 
asking what the current input state is.
Transmitting the IR code back is simple.
Just send a serial bitstream, with the squarewave encoded into it.
Though there will be a lot of noise, IR recievers are designed to 
cope with a lot of noise, and there will be enough signal hitting
the recievers passband to activate it. 
I'd want this to be useable on someones PC, without rebooting, or
complex setup, so RTlinux is out.
