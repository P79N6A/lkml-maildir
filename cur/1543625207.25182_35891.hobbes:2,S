While we are at it I have an idea that might make sense. On recent
kernels I don't see as much reason for umsdos' pseudoroot feature as
in earlier kernels. The same effect could be achieved by using
bindmounts and/or pivot_root. So IMHO it would be neat if umsdos just
setup the two mounts instead of using it's own implementation.
