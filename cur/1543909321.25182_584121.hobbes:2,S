binlog is written using buffered IO.
for InnoDB, binlog is synced first, then innodb log. on restart (in 5.0)
these are synced back up so you don't get inconsistencies.
and from a quick look at the innobase source, only data file is using
O_DIRECT.

yes. Keep in mind that the binlog grows in file size too... so this has
to sync all the metadata as well (ick, i know).
