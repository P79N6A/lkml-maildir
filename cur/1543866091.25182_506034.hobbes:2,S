Are you using XFS, right?
Can you see if the problem goes away either:
1) disabling NCQ ("echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/device/queue_depth" in a
boot script)
	OR
2) mounting XFS filesystem(s) with "nobarrier" option
	?
I've seen this problem with very similar hardware (and so I've added
Tejun to CC :).
If mounting XFS with "nobarrier" fixes the problem it seems that more
than one Seagate disk cannot handle the Cache Flush command while other
commands are in fly...
