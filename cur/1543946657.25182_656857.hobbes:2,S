Dhaval,
First, thanks for testing!!!!
Are you running the -mm kernel or sched-devel?  This will let me know 
which version you have.  I'm working on a queue of fixes for Ingo now, 
to incorporate into sched-devel (and later pass to Andrew for -mm).  I'm 
not sure if the new fixes will help you, but we need to get in sync, so 
that we are both looking at the same version of the code.
Thanks,
-- Steve
