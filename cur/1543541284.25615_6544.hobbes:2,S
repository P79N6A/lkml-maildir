One question: how is the framework going to handle tests which cause
pathological behavior in the kernel.  For example, 'infinite' hangs in
the MM system during OOM, or crashes (OOPSes, panics) or deadlocks
(process stuck in 'D' state).  Most often these are the results of the
tests I tend to run.
Any testbed needs to handle these situations, at least somewhat.  For
example, if I leave a 12 hour regression going and leave the console,
and I come back to see the system has rebooted itself, or is stuck solid
- how do I know which test has 'failed'?
Ideally, in the case where something bad but not as fatal as complete
lockup happens, the test bed should diagnose the fault.  This could be
capturing the oops, or running ps -alx to see where it's stuck.
In all the cases where I've tested the kernel, it has been a matter of
'Here is the test which crashes the kernel, let's see if it crashes this
one, too' and I just want to throw this into the consideration of how to
best create a test harness.
