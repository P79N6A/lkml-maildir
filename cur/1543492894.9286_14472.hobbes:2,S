 Then how does it happen that scsiformat(8) works for me???  It actually
is a wrapper for the SCSI FORMAT_UNIT command.

 Because it makes the usable area of the disk shrink.  Whilst formatting
makes the drive configure the medium to make use of spare sectors/tracks
(automatic remapping is actually controlled with the Error Recovery mode
page).
 If you are not convinced that Zips do actually have spare sectors then
`scsiinfo -d -Fphysical <your_zip_device>' will present you with the
manufacturer and the grown defect tables.  The latter is usually empty for
brand new disks while the former contains a number of entries differing
from disk to disk.
