The real issue is how to do the BIST write in fact once locked ... An
option would be to have an "atomic" write BIST & lock device, which
would do the whole operation with the spinlock.
I agree with Greg, the blocking should be done in the bus functions in
drivers/pci/access.c, and the helper that does the BIST thing should use
the low level callback directly within the lock.
