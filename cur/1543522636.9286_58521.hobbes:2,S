I'd like to see more assistance from IBM in the hardware documentation
front.  Their recent release of the Lanstreamer token ring driver is a
good start.  IBM hardware that I could use docs for:
	- IBM Wireless LAN entry PCMCIA cards
	- Early RS/6000 hardware, particularly MicroChannel based models
	- Various old IBM MCA cards (I can give a full list if IBM wants :)
I'm sure other people would agree that documentation on this older stuff
would be quite useful.  I'm sure there's other places that people are
needing docs from IBM as well.
