For those playing along at home - often the bug (not here though) is it should
have been a *signed* long, because arg2 could be passed from some other
function that returns negative numbers on error?  Remember that papering over
a bug is a bad idea...

Unfortunately, it's *easy* for GCC to determine that Something Odd has
happened. Either the variable was made unsigned in error, or the test is in
error. However, there's no real way for the compiler to know which was
intended.  And let's face it - we've had enough of our share of bugs *both*
ways, which is why GCC emits a warning.
