If Your Business or personal Web-Site is only viewable in English, You are missing the boat on sales or providing information via a global Web-Site or Web-Page.
AAA Technologies can translate Your Web-Site into: Spanish, German, French, Italian, Portuguese and Japanese.
If You are looking for much greater global exposure, this is a killer package.
	Check out a sample Web-Site, just give Us a call and We will give You the URL.
 In this example , You simply Click on any of the flags and view the site in that language.
	We can make it happen for You or Your Business too.
Pricing  for the six language package is around $5K for a small business site. $10-$25K for a medium or large site.  Just one or two pages, $499.00-$999.00.  We also can do Web Hosting and Maintenance on Our Very Secure Servers. 
	But don't Wait, AAA  Technologies is only taking on a small number of new clients at this time and I don't want to have to ask You to call back in a couple of months.  I really don't like to have to do that. 
	So give Us a call at: 1-800-242-0363 ext.2427  and leave Your name, phone number, e-mail address, URL(address of Your web-site) and a good time to contact You and We will get back to You ASAP.
						Best Regards,
					                General manager

P.S.
	We also list Your site with the appropriate foreign search engines at no additional charge.
