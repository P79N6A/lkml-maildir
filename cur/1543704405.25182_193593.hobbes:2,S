   There were two separate components to Grant's patch (hint ggg... split 
   up your patches).
   What do you think about GRC-resets-sub-components part?
   That appears valid (and probably wise) to me, but correct me if I'm wrong...
I know, I tried to give the impression that I was fine with Grant's
patch besides the ALL_BE bit part.
I'll take care of further reviewing and merging this around Jeff.
