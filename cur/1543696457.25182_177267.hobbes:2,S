Ahh. I think I found why ARM has this problem, and others don't.
Your SA_NODEFER handling is broken.
The thing is, you only block a signal if its stack frame was successfully 
done _and_ SA_NODEFER is not set.
It should be the other way around. You should block a signal if it's stack 
frame was unsuccessful _or_ SA_NODEFER was not set.
(x86 gets this wrong too, in the sense that we don't even check to see if
the stack frame was successful - but since nobody sets SA_NODEFER anyway,
we don't really much care).
