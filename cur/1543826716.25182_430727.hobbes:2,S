No. If slabs_partial is really empty, the number of active objects
should match the number of objects in a slab; otherwise you should see
an error message when you do cat /proc/slabinfo (see s_show in
mm/slab.c for details).
How are you verifying that the partial list is empty?

We don't have per-slab constructors. Only per-object. What do you need it for?
