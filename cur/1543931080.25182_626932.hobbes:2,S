Thanks for reporting.
The patch is incomplete. I've just sent Linus the complete fix for this.
The issue here is that videobuf_read_start were replaced by
__videobuf_read_start, but mutex is missing at the last.
The patch I've just sent adds a mutex-safe version of
videobuf_read_start, adding the proper EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().
Cheers,
Mauro
