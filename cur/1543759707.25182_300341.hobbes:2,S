We are resetting the nr_balance_failed to cache_nice_tries after kicking 
active balancing. But can_migrate_task will succeed only if
nr_balance_failed > cache_nice_tries.

Lets take an example of three packages with two logical threads each. 
Assume P0 is loaded with two processes(one in each logical thread), 
P1 contains only one process and P2 is idle.
In this example, active balance will be kicked on one of the threads(assume
thread 0) in P0, which then should find an idle package and move it to 
one of the idle threads in P2.
With your current patch, idle package check in active_load_balance has 
disappeared, and we may endup moving the process from thread 0 to thread 1 
in P0.  I can't really make logic out of the active_load_balance code 
after your patch 10/13

I am reasonably sure that the removal of cpu_and_siblings_are_idle check
from active_load_balance will cause HT performance regressions.

Are you saying 2.6.11 has this problem?

Why don't you use any other simple HT+SMP system?
I will also do some performance analysis with your other patches
on some of the systems that I have access to.
