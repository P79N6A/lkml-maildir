Manual of FreeBSD fsync says it syncs to media.
I used the same controller: Same computer, same harddisk. two partitions on 
the system disk, one for linux, one for freebsd.
EHCI:
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: EHCI Host Controller
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: USB 2.0 started, EHCI 1.00, driver 10 Dec 2004
usb usb1: Product: EHCI Host Controller
AHCI
ahci 0000:00:1f.2: AHCI 0001.0100 32 slots 4 ports 3 Gbps 0xf impl SATA mode
