Augh. Not all filesystems support holes, and I think VM_SHARED should 
trump VM_WRITE.
In general, I'd much prefer just adding a VM_DIRTY flag, and making the
COW logic set it. That should guarantee that we write out the minimal 
required sections.

But any non-dumped section _will_ show up in the ELF headers, so things
like guard pages have nothing to do with "maydump()", imho. And as 
mentioned, some filesystems _will_ write many more pages.
So if gdb has trouble with guard pages, pls get somebody to fix gdb 
instead, and tell them what the difference between p_filesz and p_memsz 
is. Putting them into the dump is just stupid.
So "maydump()" might sanely look something like
	/* Shared or IO mappings are never written out */
	if (vma->vm_flags & (VM_IO | VM_SHARED | VM_SHM))
		return 0;
	/*
	 * Was the mapped backing store opened for writing?
	 * This really only happens for VM_SHARED (which we
	 * don't write out anyway), but it's conceptually
	 * the right thing to do. Some future internal use
	 * might end up doing this.
	 */
	if (!(vma->vm_flags & VM_MAYWRITE))
		return 0;
	/* We really should add this flag */
	if (!(vma->vm_flags & VM_DIRTY))
		return 0;
	/* otherwise, write it out */
	return 1;
and that should make people happy. No?
