If I can throw my two-cents in here, I'm an embedded RT developer, and I agree 
with Andrea. 
RTAI is a very mature, completely open source real time system these days. 
Regardless of the skill and manpower being leveraged on the RT patch, I gotta 
say it looks like your re-inventing the wheel by not using the work that's 
already been done in RTAI.
Seems like there is a lot of RTAI speculation going on here.
Maybe their list should be CC'd on this thread?
