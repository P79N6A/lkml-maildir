I've heard of timing problems if it's compiled in, but supposedly they don't
happen when loaded as module.
Then the 2.4 version does not load if i2c-amd756 is loaded, but this may
have been already fixed by this patch, I have not verified it yet though.
I have problem where my S2460 goes into sleep for a while if compiled in, 
but this does not happen when loaded as module.
So it looks like there are some dependencies to other drivers that need to
be sorted out, or amd76x_pm needs to be loaded after some other
initializations.
