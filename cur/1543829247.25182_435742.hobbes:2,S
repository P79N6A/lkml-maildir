yes it seems so. But ARCH_PFN_OFFSET has been used before your patch
has been sent. So your patch seems to be incomplete...

well your approach's trick is on the mem_map address whereas
ARCH_PFN_OFFSET's one is on the computation of the index. Your
solution may result in smaller kernel (when ARCH_PFN_OFFSET != 0)
because in your case page/pfn conversion is simpler.
Maybe in your patch instead of doing:
        map -= pgdat->node_start_pfn;
you could do:
        map -= ARCH_OFFSET_PFN;
