The way pages are set up on Linux makes the virtual address =
physical + PAGE_OFFSET.
So, a __non__portable__ driver can just use that information
to access physical addresses. But, you really should use
the macros provided to make a driver that has a chance of
running on different systems.
In your case, you oremap(0x1f400000) = df400000 which makes
sense. However, depending upon the kernel version you are
using, some "portable pedantics" corrupted the return values
into "cookies", not real addresses. This forces you to use
the macros provided to access these addresses. In other words,
they are __not__ pointers, so they don't make any sense.
A trick to get around all this stuff is to just save the
junk returned from ioremap(). You use this for iounmap().
Then just take the address you asked for (the physical address)
and use that for your hardware, and the virtual address (add
PAGE_OFFSET to it) for your pointer(s). Don't expect any help
from some LK pedantics, but this hack will get you started if
you are not using any special addresses (like high RAM).
Also, don't tell anybody .... <grin>...
