I still think throwing process's page away if write fail is bad.
If kernel drop the data, that process is not able to run correctly
anyway. Why not keep the page here and let oom killer to pick up the
process to kill. In this way, we at least have some process able to run
correctly instead of every process which hit the out of disk space has
some bad data.
Cheers
