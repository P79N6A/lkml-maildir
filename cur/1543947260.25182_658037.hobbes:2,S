Instead of a new recommendation (from now on we recommend something
contrary to what we required up until yesterday --- let's go unwrap
strings everywhere in the kernel now), how about simply saying that
printk format strings are not subject to the 80 column rule?
Or keep the old text and insert after "increases readability":  "or
helps full-text searching".  And delete the example code.

Here is one vote against this indentation exception.
PS:  Could someone implement this for checkpatch.pl:
	WARN_ON(hunk_is_in("Documentation/CodingStyle") &&
		lines_added > lines_removed);
