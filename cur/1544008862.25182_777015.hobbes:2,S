I can't believe people are still making suggestions which just paper
over this issue. :-)
This thing is going to wrap eventually, so wouldn't it be nice to wrap
IMMEDIATELY so that you can trigger the problem and get it really
fixed now?  And that's exactly how things work at the moment.
On another note, this wouldn't be an issue if x86 did some condition
code thing to indicate errors.  We all know this.  So why don't we put
some kind of condition code setting support into the x86 syscall
return path now and perhaps 5 years from now the userspace on most
Linux machines will understand it and this bug will be essentially gone?
