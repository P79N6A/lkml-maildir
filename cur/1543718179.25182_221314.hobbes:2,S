This calculation doesn't sound right. The value of mempages is set to
num_physpages from the calling function start_kernel(), which also
includes pages from a potential "mem=" kernel parameter (which we use
for reserving memory to load DCSS segments on z/VM).
Whenever the amount of reserved pages goes above some limit (for whatever
reason, not only with "mem="), this calculation results in a negative value
for mempages, respectively a very large value due to "unsigned long".
I am not on the mailing list, so please put me on cc if you answer.
