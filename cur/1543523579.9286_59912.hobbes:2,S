I've decided to give a try to Rik's patch but now I'm getting  a warning
when I try to connect to internet via pppd. The connection works but I
get:
dracula kernel: gfp called by non-running (1) task from c011b9e6!
dracula kernel: gfp called by non-running (1) task from c011b602!
dracula last message repeated 6 times
dracula kernel: gfp called by non-running (1) task from c011b9e6!
So I did a 
root@dracula:~# grep c011b /boot/System.map
c011b034 t cap_set_all
c011b08c T sys_capset
c011b2b0 t exec_modprobe
c011b3e4 T request_module
c011b540 T oom
c011b564 T check_pgt_cache
c011b57c T clear_page_tables
c011b618 T free_page_tables
c011b650 T new_page_tables
c011b6f0 T copy_page_range
c011b8d4 T zap_page_range
c011ba98 T zeromap_page_range
c011bcc0 T remap_page_range
c011bf30 t put_page
c011bf54 T put_dirty_page
And found these entries...
The kernel was compiled with egcs 1.1.2 (the one provided by redhat) and
was previously patched with the solar designer's patch. The PC is a
pentium III, 128Mb of RAM and a 13,5gb ide disk. I've also a 3com
Boomerang network card.
Should I worry about the warnings ?
Thanks in advance,
Gianluca
