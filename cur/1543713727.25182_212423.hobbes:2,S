As they say around here "No hay peor ciego que el que no quiere ver"

Because the performance and size of kernel code is _critical_, maybe?
Because much of the kernel code has been carefully tuned for maximum
performance perhaps?

And there are solid reasons for _not_ writing operating system kernels in
them too...

And then there is the technology of _inventing_ a language tailored to the
task at hand... even better than your list of high-level languages.

In part because a mediocre compiler these days gives better code than an
assembly language coder by hand... and you can compile it for next year's
machine too.

It's your time you are wasting... have my blessing.
