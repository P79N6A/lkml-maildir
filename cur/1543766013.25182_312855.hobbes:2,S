Hi,
There are several types of PG_reserved pages,
(a) Memory Hole
(b) Used by Kernel
(c) Set by drivers
(d) Isorated by MCA
(e) used by perfmon
etc....
I think it's useful to distinguish many types of PG_reserved pages.
For example, Memory Hotplug can ignore (a).
2 patches [1/3][2/3] are for naming PG_reserved pages.
A type of a page is recoreded in page->private.
I'm not sure whether this is safe or not, so only reserved-at-boot pages are named, currently.
patch [3/3] is an interface to show state of memmap, /dev/memstate.
In /dev/memstate, file offset is pfn and a byte represents a state of a page.
In this patch, memory hole and Reserved pages has its value.
below is output of my box.
0xff --- Invalid page
0x00 --- Common page
0x02 --- Reserved at boot page
[root@casares char]#  od  -t x1 -j 0 -N 65535 /dev/memstate

This would be useful for Memory-Hotplug and some other stuffs.
I think more detailed types can be supported.
Thanks.
