Subject: IDE patches for 2.2.17

Well, I've applied the IDE patches for 2.2.17, and everything
appears to be working with my VIA board much better now.
I'm not sure it is totally optimal yet though.  My CDROM's are on
the second channel, and I don't much care about them.
Can I configure it somehow to optimize it for single channel
operation with 2 Quantum Fireballs?  Leaving the second channel
UDMAless?  I read something about tweaking FIFO, but don't have a
clue about it and don't want to risk anything.
Plus could y'all look at the data below and tell me if anything
is wrong or should be changed?  I'm a bit worried about the hdd
failure warning/error messages on /dev/hdd (my 4x Toshiba CDROM).
I'm using:  hdparm -X66 -m16c1d1k1
Also, if there is a linux-ide mailing list, where is it?  I
couldn't find one on linux-ide.org nor on www.liszt.com...
Any help appreciated.

[Mike A. Harris Linux tip #1 - 50 line mode]
Is the 80x25 line screen too small for you?  If you want more screen real
estate, you can set 50 column mode by editing your /etc/lilo.conf file, and 
adding a new line with "vga=ext" to the global section near the top.  Save
and exit, then run "lilo".  Next time you boot, you'll have a nice big 80x50 
screen.
