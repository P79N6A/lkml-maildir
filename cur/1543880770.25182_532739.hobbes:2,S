I don't object to renicing X if you want it to receive _more_ than it's
fair share. I do object to having to renice X in order for it to _get_
it's fair share.  That's what I attacked.

I'm running the same tests with CFS that I ran for RSDL/SD.  It falls
short in one key area (to me) in that X+client cannot yet split my box
50/50 with two concurrent tasks.  In the CFS case, renicing both X and
client does work, but it should not be necessary IMHO.  With RSDL/SD
renicing didn't help.

Well, for me, the renicing I mentioned above is only interesting as a
way to improve long term fairness with schedulers with no history.
I found Linus' EUID idea intriguing in that by putting the server
together with a steady load in one 'fair' domain, and clients in
another, X can, if prioritized to empower it to do so, modulate the
steady load in it's domain (but can't starve it!), the clients modulate
X, and the steady load gets it all when X and clients are idle.  The
nice level of X determines to what _extent_ X can modulate the constant
load rather like a mixer slider.  The synchronous (I'm told) nature of
X/client then becomes kind of an asset to the desktop instead of a
liability.
The specific case I was thinking about is the X+Gforce test where both
RSDL and CFS fail to provide fairness (as defined by me;).  X and Gforce
are mostly not concurrent.  The make -j2 I put them up against are
mostly concurrent.  I don't call giving 1/3 of my CPU to X+Client fair
at _all_, but that's what you'll get if your fairstick of the instant
generally can't see the fourth competing task.  Seemed pretty cool to me
because it creates the missing connection between client and server,
though also likely complicated (and maybe full of perils, who knows).
