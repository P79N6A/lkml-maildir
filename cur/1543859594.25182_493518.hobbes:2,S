Ouch.

That's obviously a bug worth fixing on its own. Do you know when it 
started?
That said, I think the patch I sent out should actually work on top of 
plain 2.6.19 too. I don't think things have changed in this area that 
much. IOW, you don't _need_ latest -git to test it, you just need a broken 
kernel ;)
