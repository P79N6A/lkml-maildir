I'm not complaining gcc folks, I just dislike the new behaviour in general,
it's inconsistent.
This is wrong:
x()
{
	switch (1) {
	case 0:
	case 1:
	case 2:
	case 3:
	}
}
and this is right:
x()
{
	switch (1) {
	case 0:
	case 1:
	case 2:
	case 3:
	;
	}
}
Why am I required to put a `;' only in the last case and not in all
the previous ones? Or maybe gcc-latest is forgetting to complain about
the previous ones ;)
Anyway it's a minor issue, if the standard says so we'll live with it.
(and it's also getting offtopic...)
