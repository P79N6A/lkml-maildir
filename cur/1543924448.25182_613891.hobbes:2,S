Hi
Strange, that noone notice issue with popular for wireless board, WRAP2C. 
Probably most of developers was fixing silently in their codebase and was not 
supplying patch to mainline kernel.
The symptoms is easy, it just doesn't reboot in any case, till i apply patch.
Works for me.
Can anyone format it as it is required by kernel policy? It is trivial.
