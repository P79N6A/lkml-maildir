i very much know that they are exported that way. It's the concept i'm 
against - dont we have 9 million lines of proper kernel source code to 
worry about? Why are we even arguing about this? Binary modules should 
be as isolated as possible - it's a totally untrusted entity and history 
has shown it again and again that the less infrastructure coupling we 
have to them, the better.

... which makes it doubly problematic to expose them to binary-only 
modules in any way, shape or form. Really, once _any_ kernel facility is 
used by such a module, it's pain for us to change it from that point on. 
Once markers are a 10 year concept that nobody in their right mind would 
want to change, sure, we dont _care_ about whether it's export or not, 
and basic courtesy might say that it's OK to do it. But to proactively 
export any aspect of a half-done piece of infrastructure is crazy.
