well I don't see much difference. interestingly dbench_load wouldnt give me a 
number because dbench never quite started - a whole swag of processes visible 
but not doing anything (must be related to that oops I sent out with respect 
to dbench running on mm10). Previous runs of dbench_load may have been 
working because 0.6x releases of contest use dbench 4*num_cpus instead of 
16*num_cpus which I am using in the development version. 
Might give the cfq scheduler a go
