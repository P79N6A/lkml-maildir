You might try the user triggered tracing which is available with Ingo's
realtime preemption patches.
Enable the latency tracing in the kernel confgig and 
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/user_triggered_tracing
then in your code you want to be checked do this before the section:
gettimeofday (1, 1)
and
gettimeofday (1, 0)
after the section you want to be checked.. Every reschedule of the task
will result in a signal SIGUSR2 sent to your program and a latency trace
in the syslog..
..i think
