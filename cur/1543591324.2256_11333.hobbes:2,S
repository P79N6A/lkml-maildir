Try leaving CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE unset. I've learned the hard way that this
option doesn't do any good on many boards, and actually can _increase_ the
CPU temperature by preventing Linux' ordinary "hlt when idle" from triggering.
My ASUS P3B-F + PIII dropped 10+ degrees C when I unset CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE.
YMMW, of course.
