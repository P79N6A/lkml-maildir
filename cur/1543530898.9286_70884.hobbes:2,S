I am having the same problem, but with yet another brand (seems CMD took
your advice very seriously :)
It's an IOI card, currently without bios, but it doesn't give me UDMA with
an bios either... In fact, it only gives me PIO... it's so slooowwww
-( hdparm gives 1.something MB per second. tried ide2=ata66, but is doesn't
work either.
The drive I am using is the 5400 rpm version of the 40GB Maxtor.
