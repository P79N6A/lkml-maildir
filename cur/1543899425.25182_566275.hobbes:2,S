Yeah, that looks like the reason behind almost all noises a thinkpad makes
(there are very few reports of noise making it to the audio signal, most of
them really are from the board components).

High frequencies are tricky, and they have the nasty side-effect of wearing
down solder joints with time if the joints are not very perfect to begin
with (which IS something to be worried about in ThinkPads, there are
documented issues with bad soldering breaking thinkpads after a few years of
use).  And they can be very difficult to dampen.
Would some sealing non-conductive, non-acid glue work?  Maybe clear epoxy
glue, like the one Microsoft uses in the Xbox to protect against
modchipping?  Or would the high frequency just travel down the solders (and
glue!) to the board, and continue doing its damage and annoying noise?
Replacing SMD components in the thinkpad system board ain't even remotely
easy to do if one needs to change to another type of capacitor...
