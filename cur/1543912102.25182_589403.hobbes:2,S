Here is some output from my boot log,
md: raid1 personality registered for level 1
device-mapper: ioctl: 4.11.0-ioctl (2006-10-12) initialised: dm-devel@redhat.com
ip_tables: (C) 2000-2006 Netfilter Core Team
TCP cubic registered
NET: Registered protocol family 1
NET: Registered protocol family 17
Testing NMI watchdog ... CPU#0: NMI appears to be stuck (0->0)!
CPU#1: NMI appears to be stuck (0->0)!
CPU#2: NMI appears to be stuck (0->0)!
CPU#3: NMI appears to be stuck (0->0)!
Starting balanced_irq
<hangs>
So it does appear to make it out of the check_nmi_watchdog() function
even tho there is a problem with the watchdog .. "Starting balance_irq"
is in balanced_irq_init(). It usually hangs at this spot , but with
initcall_debug on it once hung a little further down ..
It seems like there might be some other interrupt going off too early,
that causes the system to hang..
As you can see from the log above, this system is a quad.. Two physical
cpus each with two cores.
