Note -
Due to the prevalence of network gateway AV products, it is important that
all         
submissions be zipped and the zip file password-protected (password -
infected). Some  
products will reject an email that contains a virus that is not sent in this
way. In   
addition, often we receive a file that appears not to have been infected, to
find      
later that the file was infected when it left the sender, and was cleaned
somewhere    
along the line.
