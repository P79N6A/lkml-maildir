Alan, can we integrate e820 memory detection into 2.2.18 / 2.2.19? The
backport (from 2.4) patch is available at
 
http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Memory/2214.fancy.diff
 .
It applies cleanly to 2.2.14-2.2.18pre. I have been using it with
2.2.18-pre with good results on Thinkpad 600x. No adverse consequencies
(memory is reported correctly, suspend/hibernate work fine). I also had
a chance to use it on several big SMP and UP servers (where e801 memory
reporting works fine) Intel, Compaqs and IBM. No adverse consequencies
either. What do you say?
