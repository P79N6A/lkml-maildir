Just a "me, too!" here.  I've seen some symptoms very similar to this
with the same kernel version.  When I try to run a getty a tty which is
also the console (not sure what happens if it isn't a console) it
freezes up and doesn't respond or echo kernels.  Works on 2.4.2, just
like yours.
From an strace of getty, it appears to be hanging in ioctl(..., TCSETSW
I hope this gets resolved.  Its more than a little irritating.
