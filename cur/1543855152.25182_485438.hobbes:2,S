If you read my old mails you'll find that I'm pretty consistent wrt to 
the ring buffer interface.  The old code had other problems, not the 
missing exposure of the uidx value.
There is really not much disagreement here.  I just don't like the 
interface unnecessarily and misleadingly large by exposing the uidx 
value which is not useful to the userlevel code.  Just remove the 
element and stuff it into a kernel-internal struct for the queue and 
you're done.
