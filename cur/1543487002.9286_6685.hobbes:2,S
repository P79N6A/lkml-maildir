I have to cope with a very similar problem in the joystick drivers -
I do need a high resolution timer for measuring the analog joystick
values and also for digital joysticks timeouts.
I tried using do_fast_gettimeofday at some time in the past, but it seemed
to have trouble on certain machines when the interrupts were disabled for
too long a time.
Now the joystick drivers selectively use different timing mechanisms
at different places as appropriate, but always use the hardware directly,
without any help from the rest of the kernel.
The methods:
If you need a quite high res timer (approx 800 kHz), but don't need it
to be very precise and stable, you can go by with inb/outb instruction
counting. This works if you're accessing the hardware through ISA,
(or emulated ISA) which is on quite a bunch of architectures.
If you need the timer to be stable, still high res (1.193 MHz), but can
live with that a timer read takes about 3.7 us, you can use the PC's PIT,
the Programmable Interrupt Timer.
And, of course, if the CPU has its own high-res timer, then you're lucky
and can use that. (586+, Alpha, Sparc ...)
Yes, it would be really cool if I could use something like
do_fast_gettimeofday, but not all systems can have one which is both
fast and high-res, so I have to choose ...
