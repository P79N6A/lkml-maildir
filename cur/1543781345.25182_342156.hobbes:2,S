Vojtech is right. The problem is in X and should not be fixed in the
kernel. You need to complain about this on the Xorg lists.
http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xorg
In your example you missed the case of someone having X running and
they plug in a new device that X has never seen before. The Linux
kernel has a hotplug system that tracks all of these plug in/out
events. The problem is that X is not using the hotplug system when it
should. X could even track your display being open/closed if it was
listening to the hotplug events.
The xorg evdev input driver is here:
