   polling on need_resched will also increase performance on SMP systems
   btw., because the cacheline snoop event goes to the other CPU much faster
   than the APIC message - and we can skip sending the APIC message at all if
   the other CPU is running an idle thread. OTOH CPUs will run much hotter
   ...
And in fact this is what some other architectures (sparc64 for one)
already do on SMP.  We avoid the send_reschedule entirely if the
cpu is idling:
extern __inline__ void smp_send_reschedule(int cpu)
{
	extern void smp_receive_signal(int);
	if(cpu_data[cpu].idle_volume == 0)
		smp_receive_signal(cpu);
}
(idle_volume is just a local counter we increment on sparc64/SMP
 while a cpu is in the cpu_idle loop, we use it to implement our
 dynamic IRQ retargeting heuristics)
