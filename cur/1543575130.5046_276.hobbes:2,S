I frequently experiment with "zebra" (
http://www.zebra.org
) routing engine
and multicasting works for me (2.4.0-test11), according to tcpdump and
observed behavior.
If you have multiple interfaces with the same IP address (point-to-point
interfaces: same local address) then it is possible that the packets go
out via the wrong interface. This has bitten me once.
