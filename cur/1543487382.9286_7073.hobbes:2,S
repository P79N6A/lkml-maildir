What happen to data that should be written on disk (an mmapped file)?
 I've linux 2.0.31 and the power went off. I've loose all the data I've
 inserted until the last time I shut down the msql server. I've asked 
 to who has written the db and here is the various posts:

There is a problem with Linux and the msql auto-install.  It seems to not
default to msync, so a power failure does cause the data to be lost
(however, a graceful shutdown of the msql daemon does save everything
correctly).  I solved it on my 2.0.4.1 system by adding this line to
msql.h
in the source code and recompiling:
#define HAVE_MSYNC   1
You could also put -DHAVE_MSYNC in the Makefile compile options and get
the
same result.
I sent this fix to the bugs email address months ago, so I hope it made it
into later versions, but I haven't upgraded yet so I can't confirm it.

You didn't understand my comment.  In the kernel of a modern UNIX based
system there is a single set of buffer cache blocks used for disk IO
buffering.  mmap() is really disk based IO so the kernels VM should be
maintaining the cached pages properly so that they are flagged as "dirty"
in the buffer cache.  If they were flagged as dirty then a normal sync
would keep the disk image up to date.

OK.  We can now assume that Linux doesn't use a properly integrated VM /
File subsystem.  Shame, that sort of technology has been around for ages.

Next step is to work out why the setup routines didn't determine that
Linux supports msync() by itself.  This should all be automatic.  We'll
look into it.
