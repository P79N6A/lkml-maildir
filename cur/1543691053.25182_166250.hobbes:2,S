Good day,
Where can I download kernel patches for the 
Bluetooth for the 2.6 kernel? I know there
is a BK respository available, but I do not
use BK (since I am not a developer). Is it possible
to download the patches from somewhere?
Also, is it possible to get patches against 
2.6-test5 vanilla kernel?
TIA,
Grega
