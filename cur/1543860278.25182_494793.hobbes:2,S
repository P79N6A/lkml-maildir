Why doesn't this code use "kernel_fpu_begin()" and "kernel_fpu_end()"?
The raid6 code is crap, and slower. It does "fsave/frstor" or movaps or 
other crud, and the thing is, it shouldn't. It should just do 
kernel_fpu_begin/end(), which does it all right, and avoids saving any 
state at all unless it's being used by the user RIGHT NOW.
