On the contrary.  There are read & write permissions, and there is a
separate delete permission.  What is so hard to understand about that?
(In unix, "delete permission" is implemented as a write permission on
the directory that file resides in.)  
Please get rid of your "real world" notion.  There is no need to
assume that delete permission is tied to write permission, just
because _some_ os'es are like that.  Some are not that way too,
just get over that.  
And there is nothing strange about it, if we move outside the
"computer" box.  I have various paper documents with other people's
signatures on them.  I am free to shred them if I like (although
that might be bad for business.)  But I have no kind of write permission,
altering a signed document is fakery - a criminal activity.
So - permission to delete read-only documents predates electronic
file systems, and is a concept most "real-world" people understand quite well.
