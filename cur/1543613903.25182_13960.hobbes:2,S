Three things occur to me:
1. I had a Maxtor disk (of many good ones) which died one month
before its warranty ran out.  I just sent it back to Maxtor for a replacement.
2. The PCI bus runs at 33 MHz unless, 
	a) You have a server running at 66 MHz
	b) You overclock your system.
3. From your earlier post, I wasn't sure  if you understood PIO/DMA.
Original disks used Programmed Input/Output to increase throughput.
PIO Modes increase from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4.  And them the Direct Memory
Access method gained acceptance and resulted in better throughput.
DMA2 is good, DMA4 is great and DMA5 is the best of the best as
of today.
Just my $0.02.
