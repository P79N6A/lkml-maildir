Good. Go work out what the rules have to be in order for the system to
behave sanely.  "Hand-waving concept" doesn't get anywhere.  Fully fleshed-out
concepts sometimes do - once they sprout code to actually  implement them.

No, you *can't* choose any rule system you want - some rule systems are
unworkable because they create security exposures (usually of the
"ln /etc/passwd /tmp/foo" variety, but sometimes race conditions as well).

Good. Go create it. Let us know when you're done.  Remember - not only do
you need to have it generate the same results, you need to find a way to
implement it so that it's somewhere near the same speed as the current code.
If it's 10 times slower, it's not going to fly no matter *how* "cool" it is.
