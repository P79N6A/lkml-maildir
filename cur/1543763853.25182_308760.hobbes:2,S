I was more thinking about SCSI controllers, but tg3 is also interesting.
Additional non-free d-i images will for sure be required, or several 
hardware setups might make installation of Debian impossible without 
bootstrapping through a different OS or distribution.

This is one possible legal interpretation of "mere aggregation".
Whether judges in all jurisdictions of the world follow this 
interpretation or an interpretation of the GPL in one direction or 
another is the more interesting question.
