People have been hit by meteors, too. I wasn't questioning that it was 
possible in practice, or even that it did happen, but trying to get some 
quantitative values for failure rates. I guess that wasn't clear, I know 
entropy is scarse on embedded systems, I don't know what the magnitude 
of the RNG failure is, so I'm coming from the "router in a cigar box" 
point of view.

If the hardware RNG always fails to all zeros it should be possible to 
detect that it failed with the need for userspace daemons.  While true 
random bits might legitimately have 10k zeros in a row, I will bet that 
if it happens the device isn't working.
I'm assuming that the hardware RNG is only read when a read on 
/dev/random occurs and there isn't enough entropy available to satisfy 
the read. I realize that may not be true, I just haven't had time to go 
study the code.
