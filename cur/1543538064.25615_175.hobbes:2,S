no, incorrect. It doesn't presuppose anything _at all_!
The point of revoking or forcibly umounting is _not_ to satisfy some nasty
applications (if it were we wouldn't be SIGKILLing them first, see fuser
-k manpage to see what it does (yes, there is an non-portable -signal
parameter but probably nobody uses it)). The point is to be able to free
the underlying resources in a consistent manner, consistent
filesystem-wise and obviously not necessarily application-wise. The kernel
can never guarantee application consistency and shouldn't even try
to.
Therefore, both BSD-style revoke(2) and Solaris8 style generic forced
umount will be generally useful and require no assumptions on applications
side (for a simple reason that "we can't and therefore don't care" ;)
