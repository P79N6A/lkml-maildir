I don't believe that is what it's trying to say.  There have been instances
in the past where unplugging a SCSI device from a powered on SCSI bus can
result in blown terminator power fuses and the like.  Whether this still
applies today, I don't know (are active terminators better or worse than
passive when it comes to this type of thing?)  However, what I do know is
the following, and I learnt it the hard way:
  I once had a machine and other stuff on a 4-way mains connector block
  that has been used for many years.  Unknown to me, the earth wire
  had become intermittent.  I was just about to connect another peripheral
  which was directly connected to the wall socket to this computer, and
  I happened to touch the connector body on both the peripheral and the
  computer.  I now know what a shock of >120V feels like.
Now, imagine what would happen if you connect a SCSI device, where this
condition exists, and the first thing that makes contact is the SCSI
databus.  Say goodbye to most, if not all devices on that SCSI bus.
