It's serious in that it affects the operation of one of my
applications in a way that is rather hard to work around.  Sure, I
could resend the lost sockets, but it's something one doesn't do
unnecessarily for reliable transports.
And it's entirely possible, that it could bite other apps in rare and
mysterious ways.  All you need is
  - an application that sends a unix socket over a unix socket
  - a parallel close() operation on an independent unix socket
The two might happen to be from totally unrelated apps.
It's all the more serious, because it could happen rarely and
unreproducibly, and could well be crashing the app which is not
expecting this behavior.

Right, but treating a bug in your subsystem as if it's entirely the
responsibility of the reporter is not the right attitude either I
think.
