actually, i could go either way on this one.  it wasn't originally my
idea, but i tossed it out there because i have, in fact, seen comments
that explicitly said something along the lines of "make sure that
exactly one bit is set".  so i'll leave it up to someone else to
decide whether it should go in.  it's not something i'm going to go to
the mats over one way or the other.
