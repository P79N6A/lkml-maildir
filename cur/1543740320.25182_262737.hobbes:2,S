Full ACK.

Right; and these missing enhancements will cause extra-pain when they're
used some time later from core code. That is, you missed the feature
while it was discusses/accepted and need to put it in place later on. So
you've got to do extra searching etc.

Here's my proposal:
$ mkdir ./Documentation/new_enhancements_to_implement
$ cat ./Documentation/new_enhancements_to_implement/new_key_syscalls << EOF

This way, all arch maintainers just *see* what needs to be done and
get a small introduction on how to do that. I'd *really* like to see
that! That would particularly help those that cannot do full-time
hacking on their port (like us VAX hackers:-)
