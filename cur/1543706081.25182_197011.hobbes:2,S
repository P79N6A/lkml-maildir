Subject: [patch] sym53c8xx_2 uses SYM_MEM_CLUSTER_SHIFT before its #define'd

When compiling 2.6.2-mm1 (this problem doesn't seem to be specific
to -mm) with -Wundef I got many of the following warnings:
<--  snip  -->
...
In file included from drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_2/sym_glue.h:446,
                 from drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_2/sym_fw.c:56:
drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_2/sym_hipd.h:186:30: 
warning: "SYM_MEM_CLUSTER_SIZE" is not defined
...
<--  snip  -->
This seems to be a bug:
SYM_MEM_CLUSTER_SIZE is used before it's #define'd.
The patch below fixes this issue.
