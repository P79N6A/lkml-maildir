Subject: [PATCH 0 of 7]  lguest host code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

These seven patches replace [PATCH 6/10], or in the second send, patches
6a. 6b, 6c and 6d.
There are more patches because Andi hassled me about extern decls, so I
had to expose some things.  Tiny patches, but worth separating because
you never know when such changes will break something.  Compiles and
runs here...
Thanks,
Rusty.
