I fixed that in 2.4 by making pcigame look for devices if the sound card
isnt compiled in for them, otherwise provide pcigame_attach and
pcigame_release functions that drivers can use to attach pci mmio
joystick interfaces to their hardware. Works very nicely and saves
embedded one completely in the other.
