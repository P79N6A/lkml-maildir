 That's because free_irq() does not disable the interrupt in the correct 
manner.  The scenario is more or less like this:
phy_interrupt()				[depth == 0]
	disable_irq()
		depth++; status |= IRQ_DISABLED;
...
free_irq()				[depth == 1]
	status |= IRQ_DISABLED;
...
phy_change()				[depth == 1]
	enable_irq()
		depth--; status &= ~IRQ_DISABLED;
		oops!
Now if free_irq() correctly incremented the depth counter, then the last
enable_irq() would still decrement it, but with its initial value of 2 it 
would not change the status to reenable the line.
