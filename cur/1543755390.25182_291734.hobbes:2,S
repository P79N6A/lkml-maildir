I upgraded a system from 2.4.19 (or so) to 2.6.10. Using a USB memory 
stick reader one, and only one, stick is now read-only.
  - I can't go back, this was a backup/reinstall upgrade
  - it doesn't happen on Win98
  - it doesn't happen on WinXPhome
  - it doesn't happen on OSX
  - it doesn't happen in the camera
  - it doesn't happen with four other sticks bought at the same time
    and used in the same camera
Out of the box FC2 + 2.6.10 built from kernel.org source.
Before I start playing with the drivers and all, is there a known oddity 
in this area which I missed searching?
