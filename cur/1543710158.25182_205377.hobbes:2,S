I'm hoping I am wrong, but I think I have found a race in signal 
handling.  I believe this can only happen in an SMP system or a system 
with preempt on.  I'll use 2.6 for the example, but I think it applies 
to 2.4, too.
In arch/i386/signal.c, in the do_signal() function, it calls 
get_signal_to_deliver() which returns the signal number to deliver 
(along with siginfo).  get_signal_to_deliver() grabs and releases the 
lock, so the signal handler lock is not held in do_signal().  Then the 
do_signal() calls handle_signal(), which uses the signal number to 
extract the sa_handler, etc.
Since no lock is held, it seems like another thread with the same signal 
handler set can come in and call sigaction(), it can change sa_handler 
between the call to get_signal_to_deliver() and fetching the value of 
sa_handler.  If the sigaction() call set it to SIG_IGN, SIG_DFL, or some 
other fundamental change, that bad things can happen.
Am I correct here, or am I missing something?
