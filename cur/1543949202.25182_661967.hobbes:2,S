hm.
The enabled-via-command-line thing is a bit sad.  I guess runtime
switchability would be hard.
The proof of this pudding is "how many subsystems use it".  If things like
the fault-injection framework are a guide, the answer is "zero unless
Thomas does it".  Call me an experienced cynic.

Interface nit: five different API calls would be preferable to one call
with a mode argument.

The need for each client to patch this table is regrettable.

I suspect this wasn't supposed to be here.

power-of-2 is said to be a very poor size for a hash table.

I can never remember whether these things need to return 0 or 1 on success.
<looks at debug_kernel(), quiet_kernel() and loglevel().  Shudders.
Moves on.>
