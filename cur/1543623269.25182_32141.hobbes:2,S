I'm trying to set up a friend of mine with a Linux box (RedHat 7.2 -
XFree86 4.1.0). I'm running into problems getting the SIS DRI module to
load into the kernel because sis_malloc and, I believe sis_free do not
resolve.  I tried compiling it into the kernel, but the link at the end
failed, for the same reasons. The details:
<*> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)

This produces:
... -o vmlinux
drivers/char/drm/drm.o: In function `sis_fb_alloc':
drivers/char/drm/drm.o(.text+0x6893): undefined reference to
`sis_malloc'

Granted, he does have the one chipset not supported: 5591/5592. 
Nonetheless, the kernel should still compile and link.  Anyway, here's
his lspci output:

The same thing happens with 2.4.17 .
Thanks for your help.
