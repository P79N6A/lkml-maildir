ok.
i just do another test.maybe meaningful.
1)no matter i select -march=i686 or -march=i386 the result are the same. 
2)the server 192.168.0.254 (netboot) ,client 192.168.0.3
there are /usr ,/usr/local/ ,/home, /lib, /bin ....... on the server
on the client
A: mount -t nfs netboot:/usr  /usr
    mount -t nfs netboot:/lib /lib
    mount -t nfs netboot:/bin /bin
    mount -t nfs netboot:/sbin /sbin
Illegal instruction (core dumped)
B:mount  -t nfs netboot:/usr /1
    mount -t nfs netboot:/lib /2
    mount -t nfs netboot:/bin /3
    mount -t nfs netboot:/sbin /4
    mount ...................
ok
it seems that mount on the  same mount point(/usr----/usr....) error occurs
but on the different mount point(/usr------/1......) seems ok
then i install a machine with (lower version distribution kernel
2.2.13)Bluepoint 1.0. there are no mount problems above.

Which is fine. The Pentium Pro manual explicitly states that cmov may go
away. So it is not based on what we know about the CPU, its based on not
reading the documentation. 
It's a bug. -march=i6868 does not 'target an Intel P6 family chip, ...'
It happens to work because the error in reading the docs was never triggered
by intel removing cmov from a cpu as the reserved the right to do
