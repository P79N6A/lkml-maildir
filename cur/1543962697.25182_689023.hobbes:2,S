ah, good! It really looks like unnecessary overhead for the "simple 
IPIs". But ... i'm wondering ... what about softirq processing? Do these 
IPIs process softirqs on the way out? In that case the non-processed 
jiffies might be a problem.
it's all a bit messy. I wish we could start turning jiffies into a 
function (which would just read GTOD and estimate jiffies from there), 
but i fear we are not there yet ...
