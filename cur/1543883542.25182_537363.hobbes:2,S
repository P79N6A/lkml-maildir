I'm sorry I've taken so long to reply to your review comments.
I won't dwell on that, and just dive into the discussion.

You mean renumber 7,8,9 down to 6,7,8?  I guess there's no reason not to
do that, I was just not changing values I didn't need to.  AFAIK the
only thing that matters about these value is the bits < 16 that there
and the bits >= 16 likewise, for _TIF_ALLWORK_MASK to work right.

I removed them.

Ok.  The intention was to clearly set off those declarations from others.
It appears the thing other linux/*.h files do for this is:

Ok.  The kerneldoc stuff is new and strange to me, and I've never
personally experienced its benefical features.  But I've read
Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt now and I will try to convert all
my documentary comments to that style.

I did it this way to put each compat_foo near foo so it makes sense in
context, and it's easy to remember to update it in parallel if you change
foo.  Is it really better to move them all to an undifferentiated cluster
at the end?

I agree it's come out ugly.  The reason I complicated it was an attempt
to make the answer testable in #if when it's constant at compile time.
My thinking is there will be situations where you want to avoid building
in some useless dead code and just "if (0)" is not sufficient.  But
primarily I was thinking of avoiding building extra fancy code in lieu
of single-step on machines/configurations where single-step is always
available, and the current #if's don't help with that.  How about if an
asm-arch/tracehook.h either declares arch_has_single_step or else it
#define's one of two things and in a single place I'll add:
	#ifdef ARCH_ALWAYS_HAS_SINGLE_STEP
	#define arch_has_single_step()	1
	#elif defined ARCH_NEVER_HAS_SINGLE_STEP
	#define arch_has_single_step()	0
	#endif

I can ordinarily ignore syntax, but this is an abomination in the sight
of the Lord and always will be.  Fortunately, it's far from being 100%
consistently used in the kernel already.  People are welcome to change
the code after I submit it, but I just can't make myself write it that
way, sorry.

The reason these functions are inlines is that some of their arguments
are always constants, so they get inlined into not a whole lot more than
the inlined memcpy.  Having these interfaces makes it a whole lot easier
to write the machine regset code, which needs pretty simple code, but
with constant arithmetic that's easy to louse up doing it by hand.  As
real functions they would just be more code that always had some runtime
arithmetic and tests it didn't need.

I could swear I've been "corrected" in the opposite direction on this one.
It is not mentioned in Documentation/CodingStyle, and the existing kernel
code is far from consistent on it.  I really don't care which way it is,
but I'd like clear authoritative direction from Linus and Andrew before I
bother with it.

No, that's not equivalent.  UTRACE_EVENT_SIGNAL_ALL is not just one bit,
but a mask of several bits.

I've changed it that way.

I've now done that for all the files I added.

I don't agree that duplicating intricate boilerplate code is a good
idea.  I will see if I can formulate macros more similar to those common
in the kernel that don't increase error-prone manual duplication much.

I know.

I'd rather avoid the gratuitous call for some simple constants.  Instead,
I'd just move the macros to linux/signal.h and clean them up a little.
I hadn't done this just to separate misc cleanup from new stuff.  I'll
send a separate patch to do this, so once that's merged, utrace won't need
anything unclean here.

I changed it that way, except that ptrace_may_attach hasn't changed name.
I think it should change name, since it's really used more often for /proc
permissions than for ptrace.  But until the security_ptrace hook changes
name or is replaced with some cleaner hooks, the name makes sense.

I was copying existing practice for that function at the time, really just
to avoid comingling unrelated lint patches with my changes.  I've removed
the declaration now that it's in a header file.

I changed it that way.

utrace_native_view is expected to be the only user of the *_view symbols.
I inlined it because on single-arch platforms it's just a constant return
and I didn't want to add another useless call frame.  I admit this is undue
microoptimization.  Perhaps utrace_native_view should just be non-inlined
and exported.
Thanks,
Roland
