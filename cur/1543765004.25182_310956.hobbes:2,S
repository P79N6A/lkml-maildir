You're welcome. I have a patch 90% done that makes the same change for all 
of drivers/usb/* want me to send that along or would you prefer I stick to 
just drivers/usb/core/* ?  One huge patch OK or would you prefer it split 
into one patch pr modified file?   
I can send the patch later tonight when I get home from work.
