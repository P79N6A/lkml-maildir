I seems that CONFIG_CRC32=Y is broken.  The symbols crc32_le and crc32_be
do not appear in the System.map file, and insmod complains about crc32_be
being missing when trying to load the module via-rhine.o.
I suspect that it happens because crc32.o is put in a lib file (.a), and
since the functions are not used at link time, the file (crc32.o) is
dropped.
