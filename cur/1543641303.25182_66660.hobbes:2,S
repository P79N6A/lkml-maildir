   You tell me.  You're saying a billion pages (((unsigned long)(~0)) >> 2) also crashes) is never 
   going to be realistically possible?
On a 32-bit system?  No.  x86 cpus are architectually limited
to 64GB of memory, shift that right by PAGE_SIZE (13) and we're
still within bounds.
Larger memory will be then be found on 64-bit systems, and hey
then the limit becomes significantly higher.
So that is exactly what I am saying, it is not realistically
possible.
