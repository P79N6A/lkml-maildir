That's fine, but if one isn't on vendor-sec, they are still out in the cold
until the vulnerability with an embargo is announced - at which point all
the vendors are ready, but those with non-vendor kernels are in for an
unpleasant surprise. And as for 2.4, yes, Marcelo does a good job applying
the fixes asap, but that's not helping. If one runs (as I wrote) a kernel
with custom code inside, tux and, say, grsecurity - and it's not the latest
2.4 kernel - he still needs to backport the fixes and make sure they work
fine with is custom code, all that in a great hurry.  Somebody suggested
here that perhaps there could be a version of a security fix released for
X past kernel versions (2? 3?) if it doesn't apply cleanly to them. That
would be a great help along with earlier notification of a problem - not in
the way it is done with vendor-sec where you have to wear a pointy hat and
a beard to be accepted as a member. It's not that I'm whining or bitching,
hell no, I just think it would be more fair if everybody was treated the
same - vendors, non-vendors, bad guys, all alike.

yes, definitely. IMHO, it enforces prompt and open security advisory/patch
releases, just as Linus proposed (with the limited embargo). Of course, one
can just take a released vendor kernel, patch it with their custom code and
compile the way they see it fit, but it's not in any way faster or better
than backporting the fixes to your own kernel.
