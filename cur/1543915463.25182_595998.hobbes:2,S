Subject: [PATCH 0/2] UML - Two x86_64 build fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/18/442

These two patches fix UML build breakages on x86_64.
They are -mm-specific, so don't need to go to mainline until 2.6.24.
