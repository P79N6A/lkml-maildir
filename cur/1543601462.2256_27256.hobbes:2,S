Hello!
Attach contains a new radeonfb files entire. There are to many changes also I don't know -
is my previous patch applied or not.
What is noticable:
- merge with Ani Joshi radeonfb-0.1.0
- ENABLE CRT PORT ON VE!!!
- Radeon M6, M7 support (EXPERIMENTAL)
- Fixed bug of rom bios detection on VE
If who interest with further improving of Radeon-VE branch - I've placed these files in
mplayer-CVS (
http://mplayerhq.hu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/main/drivers/radeon/
). Simply because
mplayer has CVS and it is on second place after Linux by freshmeat.net popularity.
