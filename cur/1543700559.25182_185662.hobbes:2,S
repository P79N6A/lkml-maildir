I like this.   Nice and clean.
May I assume that this is -not- intended as a replacement for 
cryptoloop?  I hope so, as that would be my recommendation:  new driver, 
new on-disk format.
cryptoloop predates block layer stacking, and also support files, so I 
would prefer to emphasize their differences.  A replacement for 
cryptoloop means you must support cryptoloop's on-disk format.
