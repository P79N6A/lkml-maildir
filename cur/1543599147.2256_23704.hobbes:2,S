And scheduling gets even more complex as we try to account for work done
in this thread on behalf of other processes. And, of course, we have
all sorts of wacky merge problems
	Process		Kthread
	----------------------------
	read block 1
			schedules to read block 2 readahead
	read block 2 
	not in cache so
	send to ll_rw
	get it.
	exit
			getting through the backlog, don't see block 2 anywhere
			so do the readahead not knowing that it's already been
			read, used, and discarded
	
Sound like it could keep you busy for a while.
BTW: maybe I'm oversimplifying, but since read-ahead is an optimization
trading memory space for time, why doesn't it just turn off when there's
a shortage of free memory?
		num_pages = (num_requestd_pages +  (there_is_a_boatload_of_free_space? readahead: 0)
