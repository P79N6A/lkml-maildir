Again, it could be made a config option in which case you could disable 
it if you don't want it.

Nice example, but it's not comparable since it's not what this thread is about.
As you mentioned, you showed here a variant 4 (fully random) version.
You could have shown this even more easily, without any additional code:
[deller@halden linux-2.6]$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid
607e598a-b0f2-4d60-9ca7-22838d2120ba
This is already in the kernel and it's allocating some non-swapable memory already.
My patch is about variant 1 (time-based), which is not that easy to make unique!

That's only relevant to variant 4, not 1.
