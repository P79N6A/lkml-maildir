Subject: 2.5.44 : unusual patching error

Hello all,
  I performed a routine 
'patch -p1 <patch-2.5.44' within /usr/src/linux and received the following 
error:
patching file drivers/pnp/Makefile
patching file drivers/pnp/base.h
patching file drivers/pnp/compat.c
patching file drivers/pnp/core.c
patching file drivers/pnp/driver.c
patching file drivers/pnp/idlist.h
patching file drivers/pnp/interface.c
patching file drivers/pnp/isapnp/Makefile
patch: **** Can't rename file /tmp/poZqdzw2 to drivers/pnp/isapnp/Makefile : Not a directory
So, it seems i'll have a corrupted tree when I perform a 'patch -p1 -R 
<patch-2.5.44 ' , since it never finished patching the other files.
Has anyone observed this issue as well. Its unusual since I haven't run 
into this in prior patches.
Regards,
Frank
