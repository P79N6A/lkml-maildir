Do you really?  Why?  Exactly what purpose does it serve to know how your
kernel was compressed, considering that it knows how to uncompress itself?

You can feel pretty confident in thinking the name bzImage is never going
to change, if only because too many fingers know how to type the stupid
thing by reflex action.

Now that you mention it, bzImage should continue to serve perfectly well,
so long as you have some other way of configuring the kernel compression
method than via the make target.  Why not just make the compression method
a config option?  If it had been done this way from the beginning, we'd 
never have acquired the b or the z.
This way you avoid the entire controversy of chosing a new name for the
kernel image, and anyway, it's a nicer interface than via the make
target.
/me thinks for a moment about the idea of encoding every single config
option in the name of the name of the image file and shudders
