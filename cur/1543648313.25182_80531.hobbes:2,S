Hello,
I saw capabilities and acl patches for ext2/3 enter -mm. Is it possible
now to give an executable (that lives on an ext2/ext3 fs) the necessary
rights to use SCHED_FIFO without being setuid root? Could someone give
me some pointers for these topics (capabilities support in linux, acl)?
regards, Stefan
