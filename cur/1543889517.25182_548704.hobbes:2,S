Ahh, that would be a bug. Can you help trying to debug where it locks up?
I'm also surprised, since on the mac mini I have, I already have:
	i8042.c: No controller found.
and it all works beautifully. Of course, it only did that after the 
horrible crud that is "grub" got fixed, because the bootloader used to 
wait forever, but I thought the kernel itself was able to handle a missing 
PS/2 controller fine.
