it consumes extra runtime memory, but why not build a simple firmware
cache behind the request_firmware() interface. In this case it can be
transparent for the driver and we won't have an extra workaround for
suspend/resume stuff for every driver. How many firmwares do a normal
system really have to hold in memory for suspend/resume actions?
