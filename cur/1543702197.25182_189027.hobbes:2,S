I have tried to revert it out:
--- mm/readahead.c.orig	2004-01-07 15:17:00.000000000 +0100
+++ mm/readahead.c.my	2004-01-07 15:33:13.000000000 +0100
@@ -480,7 +480,8 @@

 		 */
-		if (ra->ahead_start == 0 && offset == (ra->start + ra->size -1)) {
+		if (ra->ahead_start == 0) {
 			ra->ahead_start = ra->start + ra->size;
 			ra->ahead_size = ra->next_size;
but the sequential read performance is still the same !
Reverting out the other part of the patch (that touches mm/filemap.c) the
sequential read performance comes back like in 2.6.0.
I don't know why... but it does.
