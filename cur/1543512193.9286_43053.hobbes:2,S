	For some reason my laptop w/o devfs seems to be working just fine
w/ it's PCMCIA devices...  The major/minor limitations are about the only
thing I see here, and I agree it would be nice to find a way around those.

	Not true, userspace daemons can handle hot-plugging, and w/
static major,minor's you can actually just slap something on and talk to
it via the major,minor appropriate for that device, at least once the
kernel is updated, but you can do that for at least some things w/o devfs
(I seem to recall you can force a scsi rescan/reset for new devices).
