Unless you use the top line of CPUs they are very likely to work with no
problems at that speed. Almost all CPUs are manufactured in one batch and
rated according how they fit the specifications. Since slower CPUs have
a better price/benefit value they have a greater demand so better CPUs get
often downgraded.

Obviously you must be referencing Windows 95/98/ME - these 'operating systems'
do not even support SMP so Abit is very well aware that the board is beeing
run with either Linux/Windows NT/Windows 2000/FreeBSD/BeOS/....

I am experiencing constant lockups with my BP6 / SCSI only setup.
Thanks to the BP6 website I finally figured out that I am stuck with
revision 1.1 of the board where they have used another VTT voltage
regulator Q6 but did not adjust the capacitor EC10 accordingly. Thereby
they did not only disregard the manufacturers specifications for the 
voltage regulator but they have also failed to test the new board for
stability.
