Got it, the rule will be followed.

AFAIK, the dual-core in BF561 have their own L1 memory which can be
configured as cache respectively. So there is no hardware to help cache
coherence management, it is very hard to implement SMP, right?
Maybe NUMA is a solution, but it is not a wonderful solution.
In some application product, BF561 core A is running Linux kernel
+Applications while BF561 core B is just for some complicated
video/audio codec algorithm.
Any Linux multicore solution in BF561 situation is highly welcome.

I will send out the SPI patch ASAP. and your signature is very
interesting, it looks like a fish -:)
Another question: when is the merge point from -mm to linus mainline, is
it the same as the merge window after 2.6.21 released?
Thanks again
