   Yep. And at the time I asked you to send it to the maintainers and the like.
When you were shown the patch your sentiments were:
1) Some of that stuff is against old drivers, I have newer
   ones in -ac so no biggie.
2) The ixj instances look like real bugs, and that you'd
   have a closer look.
3) If there are any merge issues in your -ac tree, no big
   deal because they'd show up as obvious compile errors.
4) Otherwise, it looked just fine to you.
I don't recall you saying anything about "make sure to tell the
maintainers" But, on the other hand, I can't prove that you didn't (I
don't keep detailed mail logs anymore except for what I send out
myself), so if you did I apologize.
Later,
