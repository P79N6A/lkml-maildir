What's the latest status on these?  Last I heard, some cleanup was going to 
happen to make kgdb suitable for the mainline, did that ever happen?  Also, 
it would be nice if I could connect to a remote kernel running the kgdb stubs 
w/o having to run gdb on the same ethernet segment.  Would that be difficult 
to fix?
Thanks,
Jesse
