I'm working on a prototype Hitachi tablet, it uses a Fujitsu 4-wire
resistive touchscreen. {10.4" I think}
I've found that windows-xp embedded uses a generic ps/2 driver for the
device.
I've ripped this thing to pieces on several occasions looking for chips
to help the porting, my problem is that I can not find the
analog-digital converter for this thing.  The connector goes to a
surface mount header on an 8 layer board.
I loose the traces almost instantly.  Given that I can't find the
converter anywhere what should I do next?
I've done my homework and found that this HAS to be either serial or usb
attached according to Fujitsu.
Aparently it's neither.  There are no unknown USB devices {or known
matching}, and there is no activity on the single serial port on the
system.  Since the windows driver uses PS/2 as the interface I have a
horrible feeling this thing has an interpretation layer that makes it a
PS/2 mouse, and that may or may not royally be a nightmare.
I would have posted this to a different group but there is no "input"
mailing list.
Help?
I'll give a reward to anyone willing to actually help me get this hacked
out.
Reward defined:
  Permanent shell access to my personal development envirnoment for
testing kernel code.
  Equipment in the environment: ARM, Alpha, x86-32, MIPS/Origin, HPPA,
SPARC, PPC
