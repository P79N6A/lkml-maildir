The user-mode port of 2.4.4 is available.
The swap problems that were in the 2.4.3 UML are fixed.
It is now possible to attach already-running debuggers and debuggers other 
than gdb to UML.  See 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/debugging.html
 
for details.  There, I give an example of using strace as an alternate 
debugger.
gprof and gcov support now work again.  They can be enabled during 
configuration under the 'Kernel Hacking' menu.
UML can boot from an initrd image.  This done with 'initrd=<image>' on the 
command line.
I fixed a long-standing race which caused sleep to hang.
The project's home page is

Downloads are available at
