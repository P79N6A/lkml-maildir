#define MAX_LGUEST_GUESTS \

struct lguest lguests[MAX_LGUEST_GUESTS];
I could kmalloc that array, of course, but is it worth it to get rid of
one line in a Makefile?

No, it's host-SMP safe.  There's no guest SMP support though, which
keeps things nice and simple.

No, that's why the lguest process gets the error string (and prints it
out).  Biggest usability improvement I made in a while.
The kernel log is the absolute worst place to report errors; iptables
and module code both do that and the #1 FAQ is "What happened?"
I didn't make the same mistake this (third) time!  Here's lguest when
the guest crashes:
        # lguest 64m bzImage ...
        ...
        lguest: CRASH: Attempted to kill init!

Indeed, and I really wanted to use it, but it still doesn't allow
overlapping ranges.  The first cases are in the middle of 0 ...
FIRST_EXTERNAL_VECTOR-1, and if LGUEST_IRQS is large enough, 
SYSCALL_VECTOR is in the middle of FIRST_EXTERNAL_VECTOR ...
FIRST_EXTERNAL_VECTOR+LGUEST_IRQS 8(
Nonetheless, I switchified what I could in my update (testing now).

OK, I'll run some tests here.  There shouldn't be any danger here
though....
Thanks!
