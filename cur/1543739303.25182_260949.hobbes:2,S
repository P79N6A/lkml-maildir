That works great on x86, but this solution was developed for PowerPC and 
MIPS embedded systems development not x86 desktop systems. For those 
platforms you either need a boot loader that can bring up the system into 
graphics mode (possible with U-Boot) or to init the video right when the 
framebuffer console driver is brought up.
From the sound of it that might be too early to spawn a user mode 
process?
