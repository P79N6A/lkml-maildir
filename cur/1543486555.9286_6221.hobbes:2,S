Hey, I see you've got the same laptop as me, not that many of them
around... (is it 6300, by any chance? I've got mine from NetExpress,
BTW)
Have you managed to make your soundcard completely working? It seems
to be SoundBlaster, but kernel complains that it is only 8-bit and
says that "it must be a really old one" ... :)
Sincerely,
Paul
