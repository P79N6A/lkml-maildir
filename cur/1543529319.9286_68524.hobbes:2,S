Make that 2nd, 3rd and 4th best respectively. Best has to be to
scrap the current unwieldy config altogether, and replace it with
one that isn't anywhere near as confusing in the first place.

WHat that needs is somebody to have a real good think, and to
actually document ALL the places where the autoprobing of
interface cards can conflict, along with how they conflict. Given
that, an "integrated solution" couldn't be that hard to do...
Best wishes from Riley.
