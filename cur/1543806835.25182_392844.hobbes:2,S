Free, but not open source, and that's an issue with a mission critical 
application. For home use it doesn't matter, for business use it really 
does. Only one person has the source, and he could be hit by a bus like 
anyone else. Or if he uses as much tact in person as he does in email, 
he might become unavailable at any moment.
I wasn't complaining about the price of ProDVD, just noting that when it 
first came out I tried to buy a license and found that Paypal wasn't an 
option.
