yeah - on PCs if for whatever reason the TSC misbehaves (and that's 
quite frequent) then this code sets a minimum boundary for behavior. If 
sched_clock() is totally random or does not advance at all or goes 
backwards all the time then rq_clock() still functions and falls back to 
jiffies-granularity behavior in essence.

if you call scheduler_tick() with virtual time then the "safety" 
measures in rq_clock() do not kick in and sched_clock() behaves 
correctly as far as the scheduler is concerned. (if everything is in 
virtual time then the scheduler has no way to observe/notice that in 
reality this is a virtual machine.)

yes, that has the least impact for .23 - i have added your array.c patch 
to my queue.
