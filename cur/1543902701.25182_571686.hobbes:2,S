no - it appears that 'trickle' only happened with one of your patches 
(to which i replied with that 'trickle' mail). With what i have booted 
now (only your original patch and nothing else, 100 Hz and !dynticks), 
netconsole output stopped here:
 Calling initcall 0xc0603f55: netpoll_init+0x0/0x39()
 initcall 0xc0603f55: netpoll_init+0x0/0x39() returned 0.
 initcall 0xc0603f55 ran for 0 msecs: netpoll_init+0x0/0x39()
 Calling initcall 0xc0604257: netlink_proto_init+0x0/0x12a()
 NET: Registered protocol family 16
and no output ever since - and the box has been up for a few minutes.

eth0's irq count is stuck at 5 interrupts - and has not changed for 
minutes.
i tried ethtool -s eth0 msglvl 65535, but (sa expected) there's no 
output. I've attached below ifconfig output and ethtool -S output - 
maybe that tells you something new about the state of eth0. (to me it 
only tells what we already know: tx timed out once and eth0 is stuck 
ever since.)
Btw., i definitely need your help with this bug as it's now hopelessly 
out of my league :-/
