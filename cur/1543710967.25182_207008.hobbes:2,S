Hi, 
I think it should be 0xAC (0xA4 with 4th bit flipped)
as the version reported is 10.12:
i8042.c: Detected active multiplexing controller, rev
10.12.
From little debug info that I've been sent ThinkPad's
controllers seem to be flipping 4th bit sometimes, I
can't quite pinpoint the exact sequence.

P.S. Sorry for breaking the threading...
