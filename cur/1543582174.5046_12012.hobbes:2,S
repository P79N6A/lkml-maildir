Any suggestions of things I could try to help pinpoint the problem and 
let you know the results? Everything was fine before 2.4.1.
I've been using the pcmcia-cs without kernel pcmcia support up until it 
didn't work with 2.4.1, then I tried using the kernel pcmcia and no deal 
there either.
As soon as I try to start pcmcia my machine freezes. When using 
yenta_socket I can see that the TI pcmcia and eth0 (intel eepro100) are 
both on irq 11.
when using the pcmcia-cs way of it I tried "exclude irq 11" in 
config.opts and /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia set "PCIC_OPTS="irq_list=9,10,15 
pci_irq_list=9,10,15"
as was suggested in this post :
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=inspiron
+8000+pcmcia+2.4.1&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&rnum=1&seld=929215370&ic=1
It didn't work for me - at least not with 2.4.1-ac13 to ac15
I didn't disable my minipci ethernet because I need it and if the IRQ's 
for pcmcia didn't use 11 now I wouldn't think I would need to.
