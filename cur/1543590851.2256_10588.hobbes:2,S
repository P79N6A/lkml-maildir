Hi
               I am trying to implement a distributed file system. For that I
write a file driver. I want to know the following things
1 . If I am writing a new file system, is it necessary to modify the existing
structs including inode struct. 
2 . If it is not needed, will a simple registration of the file system is
needed to mount the file system
                More over I am new to this area. I am doing as my graduate
project. I need someones help to crack the working of VFS
Thanks in advance
                          Blesson Paul
