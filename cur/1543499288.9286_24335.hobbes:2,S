Probably about the same time as the average man in the street knows
as much about how his car works as the mechanics do...

I know...

Wrong: Windows gives plenty of clues as to when to apply the said fix:
One should apply the said fix every time one switches on the computer,
as that's the only way to guarantee a stable Windows system.
Of course, if you want a system you can actually do something on,
that's a different story...

You think I don't know that!!!
Let's get things straight: *I* am well aware that one needs to know
what the problem is before one can fix it. The problem is that the
vast majority of users do NOT realise this, and look at software - ANY
software - as being a tool they can just pick up and use. Microsoft is
what it is now BECAUSE of this very fact - old Gates'y realised that
very early on, hence M$'s fabled marketing success - they RELY on that
very fact...

According to the US Dept of Defence, it was "not very likely" that
problems would be caused by representing dates with just two digits
for the year. Can Linux afford the same kind of backlash that decision
caused?

I also don't expect a travel agent to have to ask me to show him how
to operate his computer, but that happenned today...
