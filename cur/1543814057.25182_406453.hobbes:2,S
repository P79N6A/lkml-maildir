On the other side, this is the mailing list where we had the most
interesting discussions about this topic, and where the original "I request
inclusion" mail was sent months ago. If I remember well it was about kernel
2.6.14.
(Anyway I still do not understand why every discussion about reiser4 ended
in a flame war... But, of course, I undestand very well why the inclusion is
such a challenge.)
This topic is still open and there will be a further discussion, I guess...
