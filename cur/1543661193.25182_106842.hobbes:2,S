What you say is right (except that it misses symbols exported from 
modules), but I don't see what you mean the problem is?

Well, I hope you mean into the kernel tree, it sure doesn't make sense to 
put it into the kernel itself.
Anyway, I think rusty's approach is to deal with the kernel-internal data 
structures from inside the kernel tree (during the build, that is) and 
generate data in a fixed format (.modalias) for depmod to read. Since 
depmod is external, it needs a fixed interface. Makes sense to me.
