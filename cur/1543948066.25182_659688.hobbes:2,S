Yes. That's what I proposed too. In one of the CPU isolation threads with 
Peter. The only issue is that you need to simulate CPU_DOWN hotplug even in 
order to cleanup what's already running on those CPUs.

I'm not sure how to interpret that. I think you might have mixed a couple of 
things I asked about in one reply ;-).
The question was that given the restrictions you talked about when you 
explained tiny-cpusets functionality I asked how much one gains from using 
them compared to the taskset/numactl. ie On the machines with 2-8 cores it's 
fairly easy to manage cpus with simple affinity masks.
The second part of your reply seems to imply that I somehow made you think 
that I suggested that cpu_isolated_map is managed per thread. That is of 
course not the case. It's definitely a system-wide mechanism and individual 
threads have nothing to do with it.
btw I just re-read my prev reply. I definitely did not say anything about 
threads managing cpu_isolated_map :).

You clipped the part where I elaborated. Which was:

In other words how would an app place its individual threads into the 
different cpusets.
IRQ stuff is separate, like we said above cpusets could simply update 
cpu_isolated_map which would take care of IRQs. I was talking specifically 
about the thread management.

We still want to be able to run normal threads on them. Which means IPI, 
memory management, etc is still needed. So yes they better show up as normal 
CPUs :)
Also with dynamic isolation you can for example un-isolate a cpu when you're 
compiling stuff on the machine and then isolate it when you're running special 
app(s).
