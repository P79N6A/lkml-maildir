Safe module unloading is a very difficult problem.  So much so that
disallowing unloading modules completely has been discussed in the past.  
Digging around an lkml archive for more info on why module unloading is
inherently problematic, and not at all easy to do (well, not at all easy
to do well) is recommended.
