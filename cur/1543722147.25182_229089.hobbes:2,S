Subject: [Patch] tiny update to Documentation/SubmittingDrivers - list X.Org as well as XFree86

Here's a small patch that lists X.Org as well as XFree86 in
Documentation/SubmittingDrivers in the section talking about video
drivers. I think that since a lot of distributions and individuals are
moving to X.Org, but a lot are also staying with XFree86, it makes sense
to list both.
Patch is against 2.6.7
