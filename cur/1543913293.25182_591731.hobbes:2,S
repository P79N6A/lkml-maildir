This will discard EXPORT_SYMBOLs potentially used by
out-of-tree modules.
I also saw ~10% size reductions, but then at run-time test modules
failed to load, they didn't find needed symbols.
OTOH if I know that I am not going to be using such modules,
then this can be done. Will require another CONFIG_xxx, though.
