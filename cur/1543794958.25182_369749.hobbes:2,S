There's an out-of-tree reference, the pci.ids website, that carries 
this information, do we need the reference info in the kernel as well?  
So far two people raised an objection, the other wants to maintain 
an out-of-tree driver, D. Fox didn't say why he needs the symbols.
There's some other cleanups to be done yet, as >100 files define 
own PCI_* symbols instead of referencing the header...
Would you prefer to revert the patches or rather me put the removed 
symbols back again via a new patch series?
Cheers,
Grant.
