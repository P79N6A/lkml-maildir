I am trouble shooting a new driver and have found a new
kernel item that makes trouble shooting a bit harder.
When I unload my test driver and before I can reload it
(reseting the interrut controls)the Kernerl disables
the chattering interrupt.
Once the kernel has disable a spurious interrupt is there
a way to get it back?
