I don't see how you win nothing.  I create an overlay filesystem.  I 
delete a bunch of files in the overlay and it doesn't show through.  All 
my other files are still links to the originals, with the
I would dearly love to use something like to make it easy to track 
changes made all over a source tree.  If I could sync them up at the 
begining, then make all my changes in the overly, then doing a diff is 
really easy since you just look for places where the inodes are 
different between the two filesystems.  Like having hard links, but the 
filesystem breaks them for you when you write.
