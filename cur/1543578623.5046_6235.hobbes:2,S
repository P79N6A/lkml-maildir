I don't doubt you will come up with a workable solution at build time. 
However, working out a valid graph at execution time is trivial and
efficient, given a list of precedence relations of the kind you're
suggesting.  In fact you don't even have to work out the graph before
starting the initialization, it's also trivial to keep a count of
unsatisfied initialization conditions at the beginning of each
initialization sequence and block until the count goes to zero.  (In
essence, evaluate a priority sort on the fly.)
