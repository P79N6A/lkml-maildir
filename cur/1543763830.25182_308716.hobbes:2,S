And as they are doing with e.g. the complete gcc documentation.
No documentation for the C compiler (not even a documentation of the 
options) will be neither fun for the users of Debian nor for the Debian 
maintainers - but it's the future of Debian...
The Debian Social Contract says:
  Our Priorities are Our Users and Free Software
The next "editorial changes" to your social contract might remove the 
"Our Users and"...
Seriously:
There might be real problems with non-distributable firmware, but the 
known extremist position of Debian on such issues produces negative 
emotions if something like this comes from Debian.
