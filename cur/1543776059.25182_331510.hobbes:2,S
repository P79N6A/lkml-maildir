If it's the general info that's associated with the file, and may even 
be stored inside the file, then yes, that's fair.
Although I could certainly imagine foo/.../descriptions being a 
directory that's world-writable, allowing each user to maintain their 
own file inside of it.  You can even set these per-user descriptions to 
be stored somewhere else, like the user's home directory, and that could 
work for CDs.

Why is that a problem?  Put it in a script.  Mount each user's unionfs 
at boot.
And it's "something like unionfs" -- maybe it's a feature of metafs or 
reiserfs that we haven't thought of yet.  It certainly can't be unionfs 
as it stands, as unionfs doesn't work on top of any reiser.
