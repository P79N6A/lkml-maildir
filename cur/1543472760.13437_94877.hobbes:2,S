Note that you can also make a bootable floppy using lilo -- I prefer
this because:
(a) system map, and .config, lives with kernel.
(b) I don't have to worry about the "special" nature of some file
in my permananetly mounted file system.  [I mostly just treat the
floppy as a black box.]
(c) I can pass boot parameters to the kernel, at boot time.
(d) It's easy to archive kernels (just keep a stack of floppies).
Here's the script I use.  It could probably be improved for flexibility,
user friendliness, etc...  [I've cleaned it up slightly while posting,
but I don't think I introduced any bugs.]
#!/bin/sh
# derived from lilo's Manual.txt
# $1: kernel, $2: System.map, $3: .config, $*: lilo config args
PATH=$PATH:/sbin
umount /fd 2>/dev/null
set -e
mke2fs /dev/fd0
[ -d /fd ] || mkdir /fd
mount /dev/fd0 /fd
cp /boot/boot.b /fd
cp "{$1:-arch/i386/boot/bzImage}" /fd/linux
shift
cp "${1:-System.map}" /fd/System.map || echo No System.map
shift
cp "${1:-.config}" /fd/.config || echo No .config
shift
echo image=/fd/linux "$*" | 
	lilo -C - -b /dev/fd0 -i /fd/boot.b -c -m /fd/map
umount /fd
