No, if Xen wasn't an issue there wouldn't be anything to do for the PAE 
case at all (since the PGD is trivial.)
Copying PMDs is more or less an analogous case of the !PAE case, once 
the allocation is already done.  The allocation should be trivial 
though, since this would be a one-time thing.

As much as I'd rather see Xen fixing this than having it continue to 
impact the kernel, I presume it will take some time to flush the broken 
hypervisors out?
