Windows NFS server... ugh...

/dev/console doesn't exist. No wonder. Windows NFS server
can't provide device nodes, I suspect. Use devfs, or
better still, use initrd (see below).

I am using initrd for early userspace & NFS root mount.
Initrd allows me to do various non-trivial setup tricks
before I exec init.
Also I can troubleshoot stuff by booting with
init=/bin/sh (launches busybox shell in initrd)
instead of init=/linuxrc
My initrd image is at work. Do you want me to send
it to you tomorrow?
