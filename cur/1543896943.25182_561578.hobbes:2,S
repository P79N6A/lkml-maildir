Hi,
I have a Kubuntu 7.04 distro with Qt4 development packages installed.
Trying to do a 'make xconfig' fails with:
  HOSTCC  scripts/basic/fixdep
  HOSTCC  scripts/basic/docproc
  CHECK   qt
*
* Unable to find the QT installation. Please make sure that
* the QT development package is correctly installed and
* either install pkg-config or set the QTDIR environment
* variable to the correct location.
*
  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/conf.o
sed < scripts/kconfig/lkc_proto.h > scripts/kconfig/lkc_defs.h
's/P(\([^,]*\),.*/#define \1 (\*\1_p)/'
  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/kconfig_load.o
  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/kxgettext.o
  SHIPPED scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.c
  SHIPPED scripts/kconfig/lex.zconf.c
  SHIPPED scripts/kconfig/zconf.hash.c
  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.o
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `scripts/kconfig/.tmp_qtcheck',
needed by `scripts/kconfig/qconf.o'.  Stop.
make: *** [xconfig] Error 2
Is this a problem with my setup or that kbuild/kconfig can't handle Qt4?
I noticed that scripts/kconfig/Makefile checks for:
pkg-config --exists qt
pkg-config --exists qt-mt
whereas the Qt4 installation I have the *.pc files are:
Qt3Support.pc
QtCore.pc
QtGui.pc
and also the places where kconfig checks for qconfig.h doesn't seem to
be where Qt4 keeps it (in my installation),
/usr/share/qt4/include/QtCore/qconfig.h
/usr/share/qt4/include/Qt/qconfig.h
Anyone else run into the same problem?
