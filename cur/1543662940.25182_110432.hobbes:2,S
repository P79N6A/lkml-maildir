You mean that two locking mechanisms are used, where one of them
shouldn't be doing all that much ? Well, yes.
Now, is this a problem, or just a symptom ? I'd say it's a symptom:
we already have a perfectly good locking/synchronization method,
and that's through the register/unregister interface, so the
module-specific part is unnecessary.
That much about the theory. Of course, in real life, we have to
face a few more problems:
 - if callbacks can happen after apparently successful "unregister",
   we die
 - if accesses to other static data owned by a module can happen
   after apparently successful "unregister", we may die
 - if a module doesn't "unregister" at all, we die too
But all these problems equally affect code that does other things
that can break a callback/access, e.g. if we destroy *de->data
immediately after remove_proc_entry returns.
So this is not a module-specific problem.
Agreed ?
