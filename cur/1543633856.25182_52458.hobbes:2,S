Are we perhaps forgetting the _point_ of open source?
We're not supposed to be writing code and then releasing it when it is
done. We _want_ incremental changes, and open breakage.
Do bugs happen? Should we expect locking problems if the author is working
on changing the locking (which everybody who has ever looked at the code
admits was totally broken)?
YES.
Am I personally disturbed over the fact that PIO is still totally broken?
Yes. I don't like that part at all, but I do know that Martin is aware of
it, and I keep pushing on him all the time. Martin claims to be on top of
it, and getting close to be able to fix it. I haven't seen any real reason
to doubt him on that so far. We'll get there.
