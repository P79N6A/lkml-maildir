Damn,
I can't believe I've just lost a night tracking the issue, without
seeing the discussion here ;-)
I came out to this very same conclusion, and was about to send a patch
that fixes it, by doing a memcpy before starting the instruction
replacement.
(I wouldn't say anything, as this is solved, but my night have to get
some value, after all! ;-)
So I'm with Jeremy. We don't lose too much by putting a memcpy there,
this code is not exactly critical. It also seems cleaner, and less
error prone. I have a patch ready here, but I think by this time, you
guys have too ;-)
