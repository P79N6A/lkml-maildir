Subject: [RFC] Fair-user scheduler

Current Linux CPU scheduler doesnt recognize process aggregates while
allocating bandwidth. As a result of this, an user could simply spawn large 
number of processes and get more bandwidth than others.
Here's a patch that provides fair allocation for all users in a system.
Some benchmark numbers with and without the patch applied follows:
		 	user "vatsa"		    user "guest"
		    (make -s -j4 bzImage)      (make -s -j20 bzImage)
2.6.20-rc5		472.07s (real)		   257.48s (real)
2.6.20-rc5+fairsched	766.74s (real)		   766.73s (real)
(Numbers taken on a 2way Intel x86_64 box)
Eventually something like this can be extended to do weighted fair share
scheduling for:
	- KVM
	- containers
	- resource management
Salient features of the patch:
	- Based on Ingo's RTLIMIT_RT_CPU patch [1]. Primary difference between 
	  RTLIMIT_RT_CPU patch and this one is that this patch handles 
	  starvation of lower priority tasks in a group and also accounting
	  is token based (rather than decaying avg).
	- Retains existing one-runqueue-per-cpu design
	- breaks O(1) (ouch!)
		Best way to avoid this is to split runqueue to be per-user and
		per-cpu, which I have not implemented to keep the patch simple.
	- Fairsched aware SMP load balance NOT addressed (yet)
Comments/flames wellcome!
