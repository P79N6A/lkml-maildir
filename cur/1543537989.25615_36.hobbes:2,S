Oh yes, we do!
What good is a low latency response if there is no QoS to guarantee
enough CPU and memory?  I don't consider locking memory pages and the
FIFO scheduler a valid solution to this, because a single misbehaving
process can cause a complete denial of service.
I find guaranteed disk and SCSI bus throughput much more important than
your MIDI stuff, because more people are burning CDs under Linux than
there are MIDI users on all operating systems combined ;-)
