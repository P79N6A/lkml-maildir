Intriguing, when I had no ide chipset compiled in kernel, only libata 
drivers, I got no mention at all about my dvd writer.  I even had the 
scsi cd driver installed and generic devices, still nothing seemed to 
initialize the dvd drive.  It detected the second pata bus but no 
devices attached to it. 
this is using the kernel mentioned in the subject header.  
2.6.16-rc1-mm2.  using the amd/nvidia drivers for pata and sata.
Is there anything i can do to give more info to the list to figure out 
why my atapi writer is being ignored by pata even when there are no ide 
drivers loaded?

I'm not familiar with labeling ...will have to look into it, since 
borking a kernel after changing the drivers can result in a non-bootable 
system depending on how the partitions are setup across the devices. 
(since you'd have to change them in fstab and such before a reboot).  A 
way around that would be very useful.
