Hello:
I am getting the following errors on linux kernels 2.4.18-19.8.0 (Redhat 
8 production kernel)
and kernel 2.4.21-pre3 and 2.5.59. 
Feb  1 19:15:32 localhost kernel: hdc: ATAPI reset complete
Feb  1 19:33:29 localhost kernel: hdc: status error: status=0x58 { 
DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
Feb  1 19:33:29 localhost kernel: hdc: drive not ready for command
Feb  1 19:33:31 localhost kernel: hdc: status error: status=0x58 { 
DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
Feb  1 19:33:31 localhost kernel: hdc: drive not ready for command
Every few minutes this error is written into the log and my system 
freezes up for about 1 minute.
Killing magicdev stops the problem from happening. If I mount a CDROM, 
the error repeats.
I have used hdparm to disable DMA on my drive - no change.
The drive is a SONY CDRW - it is set as the master on a cable (its slave 
is a Toshiba DVDROM).  My hard drive is on a separate cable.
Can someone please help ?
