Having upgraded from 2.4.0-test6 to 2.4.0-test7, I find that I
can no longer make a TCP connection through a Cisco PIXfirewall.
I can get through with UDP and ICMP no problems, but any TCP
connection attempt is stopped.  the PIX logs it as:
%PIX-6-106013: Deny TCP (no connection) from 202.37.12.5/23 to 10.6.0.12/1108 flags RST ACK
The 202.37.12.5 address is the address of the machine I'm trying
to connect to, the 10.6.0.12 is the machine inside the fire that
I'm telnetting from.  If I telnet with 2.4.0-test6 then I have
no problem.
Can anyone tell me what wasdone between 2.4.0-test6 and 2.4.0-test7
that would upset the PIX like this?
Thanks inadvance
Kevin
