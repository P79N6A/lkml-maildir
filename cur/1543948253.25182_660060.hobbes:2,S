Subject: Intel 945GM: 2.6.25-rc3 report (with a possible regression)

Hi,
this mail is to give feedback about the 2.6.25-rc3 kernel, on an Ubuntu
7.10 system, running on a Toshiba Satellite U305. Video is a Intel
845GM, and I run 915resolution at start to make X happy with the correct
widescreen resolution. 
A lot of data is collected here (if more is needed, tell me):
http://www.dea.icai.upcomillas.es/romano/linux/info/
1) The minor regression is that I cannot have any more a correct
console. I tried a lot of combinations, but without a framebuffer,
console is garbled by ubuntu splash and/or X. With the .config copied in
the site above, I do not have console (a random pattern appears as I
switch consoles). With intelfb framebuffer, sometime it works, sometime
it doesn't work, and everytime break resume from STR. (I mean, the
laptop seems to resume, but the screen is blank).
I have a doubt about this: is it possible that some state is maintained
across reboots? Because sometime two reboots in a row led to different
results; for example, after following 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/
+source/initramfs-tools/+bug/147606
I had a nice console, but after the failed resume and a sysrq-b reboot,
no console again. 
2) LCD/CRT switch. It's the first time I tried it, so no idea if it ever
worked. Without a CRT connected, nothing happens pressing the key
combination (fn-F5), correctly. When I connected a overhead proyector
(CRT), pressed fn-F5, and the LCD went off and the CRT on (ok); after
that the LCD never came on again. pressing again fn-f5 two times lead to
a all-off, a third time made the CRT switch on, and again. The laptop is
working but the LCD stay black till the next reboot. (It is very similar
to what seems to happen after resume).
3) on the nice side of things, it seems that now echo mem
> /sys/power/state works (at least in X, I do not have a console to test
it...).
Thank you very much, 
		Romano
