 I keep getting emails from people which have seen my post.
To all of them (and everyone else):
 There's an undocumented bit in an undocumented register in
the built-in graphics device of Intel's i810 (i815?) chipset
(GMCH).  Setting that bit to a 1 solved out this problem
(which someone affectuously called 'the damn blinking
problem').
 Get the code at 
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pb/wmi810.tar.gz
 ,
compile, install, read the README/INSTALL. It's as simple as
that.
 To everyone who has tried to help in this mailing list, my
apollogies. This should be fixed in the XFree driver (I hope
it'll be fixed in the next release). Also, my thanks to
every single one who tried to help.
