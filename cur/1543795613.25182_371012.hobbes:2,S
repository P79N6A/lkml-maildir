I completely agree.  I just watched in mute horror as Chandra and Alan
spun off into the rcu blackhole trying to create one-size-fits-all
notifiers.
Making the user do the locking it needs to do is simple and sane.
And the reason USB's notifiers are implemented correctly, is they don't
use the notifier core, but rather, reimplemented their own, due to the
locking mess.
