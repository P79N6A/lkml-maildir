Sorry ? page structs are not in cpu cache at all.
phys_to_nid() on my 16 GB x86_64 machine uses one single cache line, shared by all pages.
This single cache line is cache hot yes, not "struct page"s ...
And on this machine, thats about 224 Mbytes of 'struct pages'
You carefully commented your alloc() function saying it is touching two cache lines.
But you omited to say that free() function needs 3 cache lines if CONFIG_NUMA
For SLAB use, page struct is needed because we use lru.{next|prev} to store slab/cachep pointers, but for a pure page allocator, unless I misread your patch, we dont need it, if virt_to_nid() can do its job without it.
