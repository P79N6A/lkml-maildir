Before all the bizzare mispels are dealed with, let me
beg for "dont" and "cant" be pardoned. We dont enforce
"double space after period" and "always terminate log messages
with a period" rules, because those do no good and
cant lead to misinterpretations anyway.
Dunno why, but /me thinks the same applies to donts and cants.
And I just feel that ' is a string delimiter and "don't" hurts
my eye.
