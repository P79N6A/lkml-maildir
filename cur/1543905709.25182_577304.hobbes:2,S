We don't normally use globals to modify function behaviour.

This one seems also weird. Are you sure this doesn't remove _NX from
more than the intended area?

This doesn't look correct. PSE/KERNPG/GLOBAL/address surely need to be set
for EFI areas too.
The changes to this file are quite messy.
Perhaps it would be better if you just use change_page_attr() afterwards.
This would make it using 4K pages instead of 2MB, but that wouldn't be a catastrophe.
What exactly are you trying to do here? Just remove _NX for some areas?
