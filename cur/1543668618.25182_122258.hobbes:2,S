Well, I got bored.
size=<ram>%+<swap>%
So size=100%+50% will set the tmpfs size at 100% the size of your ram
+ 50% the size of your swap.
It's just an idea. It's still simple and gives you what you seem to want
(in part... there's no dynamic changes on swapon/off) and what I want
(the ability to set the size off just real ram).
It seems like a decent compromise so I'm sure someone'll hate it. :)

Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some
of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi.
No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."
