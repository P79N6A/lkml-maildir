Hi,
Tried latest patch with the same result - freeze...
No extra patches added.
running from console as root
mmap002 from memtest-0.0.3
with RAMSIZE defined as 90 MB (I have 96MB)
after a while with heavy disk access (thrashing?) the drive
becomes silent - no more progress...
[if you can not repeat this - try with less memory 32 MB...]
Magic works!
Magic memory
 Constantly LOW on inactive_clean (0 is the most common)
 lots of shared memory (almost equals active)
 [can be normal condition since mmap002 produces dirty
  mmaped pages]
Magic process:
  Manual samples gave the following locations.
  (NOTE: not a call trace)
  We are trying to clean pages, but do we make any
  progress since disk is silent?
Trace; c0127d85 <page_launder+3d/724>
Trace; c0126dad <deactivate_page_nolock+13d/248>
Trace; c0127e00 <page_launder+b8/724>
Trace; c0128035 <page_launder+2ed/724>

Trace; c0127e00 <page_launder+b8/724>
Trace; c012fd38 <try_to_free_buffers+4/138>
Magic Sigterm (Alt+SysRq+E)
 Gives you a running system again.
Notes:
 Probably timing critical for entry into this state
 since adding a few printk:s makes it happen less often.
 I have even got complete mmap002 runs succeed - but
 disk is running too much and for too long time...
 a lot more than 10 min - normal run on previous testX
 did usually take less than 3 minutes.
