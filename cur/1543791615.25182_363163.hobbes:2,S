Interresting bug report. You have to know that the machine (nForce2 
based) that have the ntpd problem is NFS root and import via NFS several 
mount points. In fact this machine don't have any hard disk and make 
everything over NFS. ( This way, with a passiv water cooling and passiv 
power supply I enjoy an absolutly silent dektop. )
I have an other machine (VIA based) with a kernel 2.6.12 that is NFS 
root the same way but don't have the ntpd problem.
