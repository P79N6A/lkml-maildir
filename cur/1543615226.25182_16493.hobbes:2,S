That's what /proc/cpuinfo says. Is there an instance where one can find
the "official" families and model numbers? Something like a standard?
The only thing I've found on the net is this:
  
http://grafi.ii.pw.edu.pl/gbm/x86/cpuid.html#AuthenticAMD
Which doesn't list the ELANs. I couldn't also find something on AMD's
page.
