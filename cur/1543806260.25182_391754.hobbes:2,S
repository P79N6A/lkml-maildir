Yes it is available, and a whole slew of GUI applications use it.   
It's called "hal", or Hardware Abstraction Layer, and it has small  
hooks into udev and a bit of sysfs code so that it has a list of all  
devices of various types and knows what their associated udev-created  
device nodes are.  This means that I can configure udev to put my CD  
drive on /dev/burner and correctly written GUI programs will just  
find it and work.

Your average low-tech user installing stock Debian (Not even  
something targeted at user-friendliness like Ubuntu), will end up  
with udev/hal installed.  When he plugs in his burner, it will get  
the name /dev/cdrom[0-9] behind the scenes, and hal will notice.   
When he starts up k3b, it will use hal and automatically notice his  
drive, showing him brand, serial number, etc.

Uhh, both happen.  The system tells userspace "I just got/have a  
device with brand 'foo', specs 'bar', serial 'baz', etc".  Userspace  
(behind the scenes, without your low-tech user caring) creates a  
device node "/dev/cdrom[0-9]" and alerts hal, which sends it to your  
application, which nicely alerts the user.  As an admin who does a  
lot on the command line, I can tie certain drive serial numbers to / 
dev/blue_burner and /dev/red_burner for my own ease-of-command-line- 
use without breaking the aforementioned hal system.
