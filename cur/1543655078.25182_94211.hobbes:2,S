2.4.20-ac1, Debian testing.
While running `updatedb --localuser=nobody 2>/dev/null`, I receive several pages of the following message:
Dec  5 13:43:25 perseus kernel: Directory sread (sector 0x18) failed
Dec  5 13:43:25 perseus kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Dec  5 13:43:25 perseus kernel: 02:00: rw=0, want=12, limit=4
Some of the numbers are different sometimes.  I can post my syslog if anyone is interested, but I'm not even sure if this is a kernel issue.
Disk configuration is as follows:
pryzbyj@perseus:~$ mount
/dev/hda1 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
/dev/hda3 on /home type ext3 (rw)
/dev/hda4 on /usr/src type ext3 (rw)
