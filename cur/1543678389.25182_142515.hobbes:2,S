Been using 2.5.x all this time. Just did the following mod on 2.5.72-bk3:
#ifdef CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
        if (state == 4) {
                if (state_string[1] == 'b') {
                        do_suspend_lowlevel_s4bios(0);
                } else {
                        software_suspend();
                }
                goto Done;
        }
#endif  
And it activated bios suspend just fine. It didn't resume properly though.
The bios resume screen was left behind and the whole setup hung. I've
been using the suspend2disk functionality of this laptop under apm and 2.4.x
just fine (for months really - I rarely 'rebooted' my laptop) so I don't
think it's the bios that's b0rked.

Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some
of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi.
No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."
