I compiled my system from scratch following the guide of the LFS. LFS recommends that you create a symbolic link from /proc/mounts to /etc/mtab. After reading the mount man page, that seems to be my problem. mtab shouldnt be a symlink. Thanks for the help. I'm going to e-mail the LFS mailing list about their mtab symlink now
