"Minor" but leads to interesting results in the end when coupled
with something like noflushd that regulary send those signals ;)
Not only we leak them, but we also get nr_queued_signals reaching
nr_max_signals. This has the side effect of making do_notify_parent()
silently fail when a pthread is dead (libpthread use an RT signal).
The end result is that after a few days, a machine running noflushd
and thread intensive apps like evolution and gkrellm will have dozens
(or even hundreds) of zombies as the child threads are never reclaimed
by libpthread "manager" thread since it never gets the signal...

I'll cook something tomorrow (I'm away from any 2.4 machine tonight).

Interesting... though hopefully, I didn't see anybody else causing
such a constant increase of nr_queued_signals so far on this laptop...
