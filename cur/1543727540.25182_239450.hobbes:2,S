Well yes, that's exactly why there is a discussion. As I have written
before, filtering cannot be perfect exactly because of this. Either you
leave unknown commands unfiltered (and risk a problem with new commands
until you update your kernels), or you add the _policy_ to filter
unknown commands and risk not working with new devices for no good
reason.
And if you really want to try and cover everything, you want to add
filtering tables per _device_. Which is basically impossible to do, and
is completely unmaintainable.
But I've already stated that before.
