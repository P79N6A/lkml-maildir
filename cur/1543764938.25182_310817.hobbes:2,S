Yes.  And if you accidentally lose the flash disk, you are locked out of your
own data. ;-)  The same happens if the data on the flash disk is lost (which
occurs, from time to time).  You should be _really_ careful doing such things
and IMO it's not to be tried by Joe User.
OTOH, the encryption of the system image during suspend is generally
a very good idea.  IMO we should also check the integrity of the image
at that time, which would require computing some checksums on suspend.
Greets,
Rafael
