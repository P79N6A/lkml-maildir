Right, especially not the events with the same DEVPATH, like "remove"
beating an "add". But I'm not sure if the number isn't useful. Whatever
we may do with the hotplug over netlink in the future, we will only have
/sbin/hotplug for the early boot and it may be nice to know, what events
we have already handled...

How about just reserving 20 bytes for the number (u64 will never be
more than that), save the pointer to that field, and fill the number in
later?
Thanks,
