ok. I too fixed up the shpte #ifdef tangle in there as well, and it was
complex for no good reason, so i suspected that it was missing a line or
two.

hm, i somehow missed to add this, this was reported once already.

the limit is only there for 32-bit ptes on 32-bit platforms. 64-bit ptes
(both true 64-bit architectures and x86-PAE) has a ~64 zetabyte filesize
limit. I do not realistically believe that any 32-bit x86 box that is
connected to a larger than 2 TB disk array cannot possibly run a PAE
kernel. Just like you need PAE for more than 4 GB physical RAM. I find it
a bit worrisome that 32-bit x86 ptes can only support up to 4 GB of
physical RAM, but such is life :-)
