I'll tweak it a bit, so that it's identifed as a C-7x0 not as
an A-300, and merge it through Greg into 2.6 and 2.4.  Thanks
for the patch!
Here's where I wish Sharp took a more enlightened approach to
their firmware:  they _could_ just modify the firmware revision
number and descriptive strings.  They're gratuitously requiring
a new host-side driver for each new product variant, which is
just a PITA.  Maybe by the time these get distributed in the US,
that can be resolved.
You wouldn't happen to have the C-760 product ID too, would you?
(That's got more flash and battery power.)
