I think that for architectures that do allow allnoconfig to build, they
have a fallback for these situations.  allnoconfig is a good quick way to
see if the core code builds ok for an architecture.
So maybe you could choose (even at random) defaults for the above two
things rather than erroring.  That would also help with randconfig builds.
If you make it work, let me know and I will reenable the build.
