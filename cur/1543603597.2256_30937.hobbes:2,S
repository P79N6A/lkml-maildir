Should be fine with ext3 and XFS.  It's not a journaling problem as
much as NFS assuming a particular property of the filesystem.
Resierfs had a particular difficulty with NFS, mainly because the NFS
spec assumes that every file can be looked up by a 64-bit cookie which
doesn't change over reboots, and that's a hard invariant to deal with
when you've only got 32-bit inode numbers in the kernel and when your
filesystem is tree-structured so that the file metadata on disk can
move about.  The VFS has been extended a bit in more recent kernels to
allow Reiserfs to give NFS the hints it needs to get the file handles
right.
Cheers,
 Stephen
