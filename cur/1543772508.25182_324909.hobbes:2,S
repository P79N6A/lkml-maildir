I've just started merging my Mac sonic work into 2.6.12-rc6. m68k doesn't 
yet implement the modern DMA API, but it is easy to fake it for a while 
for macsonic.c. So I don't mind converting macsonic, jazzsonic and the 
shared sonic driver core to the new API.
But, I knowing nothing about the Jazz DMA controller. I need some help 
from the MIPS people:
Would I be right to say that vdma_{alloc,free}() can be changed to 
dma_{,un}map_single? The other Jazz specific routine that sonic uses is 
vdma_log2phys, and I don't know if that has a better alternative.
