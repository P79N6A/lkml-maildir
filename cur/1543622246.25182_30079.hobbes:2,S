Oh absolutely.  Even a one-page-per-hour leak would be catastrophic.
But there is a problem.  If CPUA is always setting pages dirty,
and CPUB is always setting them clean, CPUA's counter will eventually
overflow, and CPUB's will underflow.  Drat. 
One fix for this would be special-case over- and under-flow handling:
	if (TestSetPageDirty(page)) {
		preempt_disable();
		nr_dirty_pages[smp_processor_id()]++;
		if (nr_dirty_pages[smp_processor_id()] > 2,000,000) {
			fit_it_up();
		}
		preempt_enable();
	}
	void fix_it_up()
	{
		spin_lock(&global_counter_lock);
		global_counter += 1,000,000;
		nr_dirty_pages[smp_processor_id()] -= 1,000,000;
		spin_unlock(&global_counter_lock);
	}
	int approx_total_dirty_pages()
	{
		int ret;
		spin_lock(&global_counter_lock);
		ret = global_counter;
		for (all cpus) {
			ret += nr_dirty_pages[cpu];
		}
		spin_unlock(&global_counter_lock);
		return ret;
	}
Or something like that.
Then again, maybe the underflows and overflows don't matter, because the
sum of all counters is always correct.   Unless there's a counter roll-over
during the summation.  No.  Even then it's OK.
hmmm.
