Ok, so it would seem to be writeback related _somehow_. However, most of 
the differences (I _thought_) in ext3 actually show up only if you have 
*both* "nobh" and "data=writeback", and as far as I can tell, just a 
simple "data=writeback" should still use the bog-standard 
"block_write_full_page()".
Andrew?
Although as far as I can see, then ext2 should work as-is too (since it 
too also just uses "block_write_full_page()" without anything fancy).
Strange.
How about this particularly stupid diff? (please test with something that 
_would_ cause corruption normally).
It is _entirely_ untested, but what it tries to do is to simply serialize 
any writeback in progress with any process that tries to re-map a shared 
page into its address space and dirty it. I haven't tested it, and maybe 
it misses some case, but it looks likea good way to try to avoid races 
with marking pages dirty and the writeback phase ..
