Hmm.. That looks "impossible", so it's most likely a serious bh corruption 
issue. But what corrupts it is hard to guess at - the actual trace to that 
point has nothing to do with the MO drive itself, so you've either hit a 
generic ext2 bug (hey, it's possible, I guess, but sounds very unlikely), 
or the ide-scsi driver has corrupted memory. 
The latter is obviously the more likely schenario, but it does require 
somebody with the MO device to actually try to figure out how the 
corruption occurs.. Probably with a big printk buffer and a lot of 
printk's..
