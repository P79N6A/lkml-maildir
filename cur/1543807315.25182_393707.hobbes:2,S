This is 2.6.16-rc2 on a generic PC - Gigabyte 7ZXE mainboard with AMD 
Duron 1300, 896M RAM, PS2/keyboard, PS/2 mouse, ATA disk, 2 PCI NICs 
(rtl8139c), Matrox AGP Graphics, BT878 TV card. There were no psmouse 
probmes with up to 2.6.15. 2.6.16-rc1 not tested since iptables was 
broken.
PNP: PS/2 Controller [PNP0303:PS2K,PNP0f03:PS2M] at 0x60,0x64 irq 1,12
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12

mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice

lsinput tells the following about the mouse:
/dev/input/event2
    bustype : BUS_I8042
    vendor  : 0x2
    product : 0x6
    version : 0
    name    : "ImExPS/2 Generic Explorer Mouse"
    phys    : "isa0060/serio1/input0"
    bits ev : EV_SYN EV_KEY EV_REL
IIRC it's a Microsoft mouse with 5 buttons and a scrollwheel.
I have no idea what actual acivity caused these messages - the machine 
was probably running movie playing with mplayer or tvtime during the 
time the messages appeared, with about 2 hours between them.
