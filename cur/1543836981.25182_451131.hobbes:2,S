Looking at my build it appears bytes_out is being placed in the .bss.
A little odd since it is zero initialized but no big deal.
Could you confirm that bytes_out is being placed in the .bss section 
by inspecting arch/x86_64/boot/compresssed/misc.o and
arch/x86_64/boot_compressed/vmlinux.   "readelf -a $file" and then
looking up the section number and looking at the section table to see
which section it is was my technique.
If bytes_out is in the .bss for you then I suspect something is not
correctly zeroing the .bss.  Or else the .bss is being stomped.
I'm not certain how rep stosb can be done wrong but some bad pointer
math could have done it.
