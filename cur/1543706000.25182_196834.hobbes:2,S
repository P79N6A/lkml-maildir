By that stage though, it has already passed through the
imbalance_pct filter, and with the higher precision and
averaging of previous loads, it might take a while to
get there.

Right, it should not be moved. I think Anton is seeing a problem
with active balancing, and not so much a problem with the imbalance
calculation though.

Yes, although as long as it's node local and happens a couple of
times a second you should be pretty hard pressed noticing the
difference.
