There are other, harder problems associated with doing this is userspace.
Really, the device needs to be considered separately at each level of
driver processing.  At the USB level it may still appear to be the same,
but at the SCSI level it may appear different.  Or at the SCSI level it
may be the same, but at the gendisk level it may be different (different
media, partition table changed).  Or at the gendisk level it may be the
same, but at the filesystem level one or more of the partitions may be
different (superblock changed).
Each level would need its own way of checking for changes and recreating 
the appropriate data structures.  And while making the determinations, we 
would need to temporarily set the device to read-only.  Yes, userspace 
could do _some_ of the work, but it would need a lot of help from the 
kernel.
