softirq tasklets would be unsafe too, oh well, if you take it really
from irq context (irq/softirq/tasklet) then just a spinlock isn't
enough, it'd need to be an irq safe lock or whatever similar plus you
must be sure to never generate exceptions triggering the call inside the
critical section. sounds like we need some per-arch abstraction to cover
this, we for sure don't want an irq spinlock for this, then we can as
well leave the semaphore for all archs but parisc.
