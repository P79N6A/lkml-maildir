I'm afraid I can't check anymore, the disk has been moved to another

I finally solved the problem by initializing the partitiontable on
another machine where the kernel could get the right geometry. Once
that was done the originally machine had no problem accessing all
13.5Gb.

Yes on both questions.

PS: why do you use `Guest section DW' these days? It keeps confusing me
