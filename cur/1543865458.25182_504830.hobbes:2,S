We can always fix the user space tool later, but it is important to
get at least the kernel interface right, so we can add the functionality
later without breaking new user space on old kernels or vice versa.

So what do you do with the samples for object_id == 0? I would expect them
to be simply added to the sample buffer for the kernel, which is sort
of special in oprofile anyway.
