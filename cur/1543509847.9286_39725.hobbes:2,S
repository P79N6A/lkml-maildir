Nope, that's not it.
Checking messages after boot shows:
insmod: /lib/modules/2.2.12/fs/nfsd.o: unresolved symbol do_nfsservctl
(modprobe by hand gives the same error, and the above was probably
triggered by modprobe anyway.)
I fiddled with the source and couldn't get the module to work in
2.2.12, and finally gave up and compiled it in, which seemed to work.
(I.e, the user side daemons now load--I haven't bothered to see if it
actually works.)
I don't know how to fix this problem with the module.
Looked sorta like someone didn't include the right stuff in filesystems.c ??
