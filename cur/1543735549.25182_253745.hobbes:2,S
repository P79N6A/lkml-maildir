The point is, you need to make a choice if you want to infer the
tty from an fd. You can't assume stdin and stdout point to the same
console. And if we talk about video mode settings, why would I want
to use the fd that the command gets keyboard input from?
The shell backtick obviously uses stdout of the command inside
the backticks. ;)
