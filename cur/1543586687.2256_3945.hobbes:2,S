This is not correct Ingo. I haven't seen the HP code but if You store processes
in slots S :
S = FS( goodness(p, p->processor, p->mm) )
and You start scanning from the higher slots, as soon as you find a task with a
goodness G' that is equal to the max goodness in slot You can choose that
process to run.
Again, if You haven't found such a goodness during the slot scan but You've
found a task with a goodness G' :
G' >= SG - DD
where :
SG = max slot goodness
DD = SG(i) - SG(i - 1)
You can select that task as the next to spin.
This was the behaviour that was implemented in my scheduler patch about 2 years
ago.
Beside this, I this that with such loads We've more serious problem to face
with inside the kernel.
