Well unless the parport stuff changed to support ports where one cant 
read the data latch, its still needed. It is true this hasnt ever 
*worked* although the code looks ok (with the exception of the ECP/EPP 
stuff thats in there).
I'll see if I can find some time for a bit of arm26 TLC once I've move 
house (could be 6 months though) as I'll actually have enough space to 
get the machine out of its packing box again...
