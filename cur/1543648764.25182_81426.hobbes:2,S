Does not work here.
# mount /dev/fd0 /floppy/
# mount /dev/hda1 /floppy/test/
# umount /floppy/
umount: /media/floppy: device is busy
# touch /floppy/foo
umount -f /floppy/
umount2: Device or resource busy
umount: /dev/fd0: not mounted
umount: /media/floppy: Illegal seek
# touch /floppy/foo2
# mount
/dev/fd0 on /floppy type vfat (rw,sync)
/dev/hda1 on /floppy/test type vfat (rw)
In other words, your suggested method does not work here. (Kernel 2.4.18, 
util-linux-2.11n)
# mount -o remount,ro /floppy/
/dev/fd0 on /floppy type vfat (ro,sync)
/dev/hda1 on /floppy/test type vfat (rw)
This, however, seems to work.
