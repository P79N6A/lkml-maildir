d_path displays the path from the rootfs, whereas dentry_path displays
the path from the root of that filesystem.

this patch was intially developed with Al Viro. He preferred to keep the
two functions separate. BTW: this patch owes credits to Al Viro for his
initial set of ideas.

my patch was generated about  a year or so back using probably the
2.6.18 code base which had the "//deleted" convention. That got copied
in my patch. But since then I see that the original code has changed to
use the " (deleted)" convention. 
Yes this patch has to be changed to be consistent with the existing
code.

yes. good observation. I will send a patch with this optimization and
the above mentioned change.
