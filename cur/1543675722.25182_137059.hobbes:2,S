Hi
I'm running 2.4.21-rc6, and one of my drives has failed with the following messages.  Does this indicate a hardware failure?
All but one of the partitions are raid1, so they still work. The one raid0 partition, which holds less important stuff like squid cache files, obviously doesn't.  I tried to remount it read-only, but mount hangs for ever. It would be nice if linux could deal with hardware failures like this gracefully, and allow the fs to be unmounted.
here is the log:

more of the same.
Get back to me if you need more info.  I'll try the drive in another machine soon to check it.
Cheers
