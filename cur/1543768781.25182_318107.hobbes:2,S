Done. Does transmeta have PAT btw ? I know newer VIA has it,
but I haven't looked through the docs to double check its
implementation yet.

Noted.

AIUI, only as long as we don't have an MTRR covering the same range marked WC.
It seems to be the only thing I could find documenting the differences
between 'uncached' and 'uncacheable' in this context.
Though I've only looked through the Intel & AMD K8 docs, I don't have
the K7 ones to hand.
