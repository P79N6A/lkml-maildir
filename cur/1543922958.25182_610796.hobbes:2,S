As it stands this is a very old build bug.  I believe those
symbols have always been exported inside of #ifdef CONFIG_SYSCTL.
So if this is really something we want to stop doing we should
be able to take a few extra moments remove the code from the
two problem drivers, and remove the exports.
It didn't look like any of the other users could possibly be
modular.
