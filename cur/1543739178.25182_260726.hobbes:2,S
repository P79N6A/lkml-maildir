Hi,

yes. (maybe. suppose logical volume.)

yes, absolutely, for us.
Our target is customer's production system, not developping/debugging
system. The chance of capturing fault analysis materials may be only
one time. If a kernel destroy the memory using user process(page cache
, buffer cache), looking the pattern of destroy is great helpful to 
analyze. (note that I have encountered such case many times)
We also analyze user proccesses at the crash time from the dump.

You should chose a dump tool you like.
We believe we need whole memory. But we understand there is an opinion
like you (reduce saving memory is better). We don't force to use our
tool. We make "mini kernel dump" as independent from kernel as possible.
Thank you.
