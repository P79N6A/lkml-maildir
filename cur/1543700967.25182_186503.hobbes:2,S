I usually work this sort of thing out by "random sampling".  When
everything is in steady state, break into kgdb and start looking at task
backtraces, see where they are all sleeping.
If it's in the pagefault handler, go up to do_page_fault() and work out the
faulting address.  Compare that with /proc/pid/maps to see if it's libc or
whatever.
Repeat the above N times until you have a decent feel for what's happening
in there.  It doesn't take long.
