Well, popup dialogs are very annoying...
The current system has enough windows for dislaying the important informations
(hierarchy, help, informations).

To my mind, the current configuration system provides enough options (ie views)
for most of the users without having a program too complex/big...
Moreover, I think that the Split & Tree views are very practictal.
The +/- icons (even if they are not available in the GTK+ version) allow you
to change an option without displaying the other columns.
It may be very useful if you have a small screen size. You don't have to scroll
the window...
