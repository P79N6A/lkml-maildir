Subject: [PATCH] doc/oops-tracing: add Code: decode info
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/22/32

From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
Add info that the Code: bytes line contains <xy> or (wxyz) in some
architecture oops reports and what that means.
Add URL for a script by Andi Kleen that reads the Code: line from an Oops
report file and generates assembly code from the hex bytes.
(This script does not handle Code: lines that contain <xy> or (wxyz)
markings.)

+Alternatively, you can use the shell script from

  Usage is:
+decodecode <oops.txt
+
+The hex bytes that follow "Code:" may (in some architectures) have a series
+of bytes that precede the current instruction pointer as well as bytes at and
+following the current instruction pointer.  In some cases, one instruction
+byte or word is surrounded by <> or (), as in "<86>" or "(f00d)".  These
+<> or () markings indicate the current instruction pointer.  Example from
+i386, split into multiple lines for readability:
+
+Code: f9 0f 8d f9 00 00 00 8d 42 0c e8 dd 26 11 c7 a1 60 ea 2b f9 8b 50 08 a1
