Short of dmidecode, assuming you're going to do what I think
you're going to do, I think the following should be sufficient
(change dmi_printk to use printk). If you really need dmidecode,
give me a pointer to it, not that I'm sure how to revert the
BIOS image...
This is assuming it's the BIOS which causes the problem, as opposed
to the embedded controller which I upgraded from 1.00 to 1.02
contemperaneously.
And the answer to 'where is the new firmware' is, for BIOS & embedded
controller:

Sadly they aren't indexed properly from the main IBM site (i.e.
find 'T23 BIOS' finds 1.02).
