hm, why the distinction along whether the debugger == real parent? What
wrong can happen if we always move traced tasks to the ptrace list? The
task will be both in the ptrace list and in the parent's child list, and 
everything should work as expected. This looks a more symmetric and 
simpler thing to me.

i'm not sure about this either. What happens if an (untraced) parent has
traced and untraced children, and does a wait4. Would it confuse the
debugger if the parent could get one of the traced tasks as a result in
wait4? And how does the debugger solve this problem?
