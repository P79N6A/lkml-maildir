That looks appropriate for 2.6.23.x:

However it is a bit mystifying that
55d9fcf57ba5ec427544fca7abc335cf3da78160 would cause a dma mask problem
(isn't it?)
The scsi people might want to restore
55d9fcf57ba5ec427544fca7abc335cf3da78160 and then apply Miquel's patch on
top for 2.6.24, or do it for 2.6.25?
