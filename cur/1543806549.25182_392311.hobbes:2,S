Actually, one of the tasks that was moved might need to resched right
away, since it preempts the current task that is doing the moving.

No real work is lost.  This is a loop that individually pulls tasks.  So
the bail only stops the work of looking for more tasks to pull and we
don't lose the tasks that have already been pulled.

I need that bail in the loop, so it can stop if needed. Like I said, it
can be a task that is pulled to cause the bail. Also, having the run
queue locks and interrupts off for over a msec is really a bad idea.

Thanks, and thanks for the comments too.  I'm up for all suggestions and
ideas.  I just feel it is important that we don't have unbounded
latencies of spin locks and interrupts off.
