        IMHO, this isn't good. I just gave this a run with 2.5.15, and 
opl3_oss.c wasn't even touched during compile (either into the kernel or as a 
module); it's completely passed over. more than likely when inserted with 
modprobe, OSS emulation would fail from functions not being there. I haven't 
tried that yet, but this would be my guess..
                                                        BL.
