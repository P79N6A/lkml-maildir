Per-CPU counters are interesting because they avoid the atomic
operation _and_ potential cacheline bouncing. Given the fact that less
commonly used counters in the reclaim path are already per-CPU,
I think that it might be worth to do it here too.

OK... You could change the atomic counters to per-CPU variables
in "struct shrinker".
