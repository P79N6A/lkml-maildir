wrong. It _is_ a safe method. Since you seem to be so sure and Pavel has
posted his patch, could you please point out the insecurities in the ELF
capabilities patch? Linus' problem was not with the security side, but
rather with some conceptual issues.

you are really naive if you think that putting priviledges into the
filesystem guarantees security. If you are priviledged enough to edit root
owned ELF sections then you are probably priviledged enough to use a 'disk
editor' as well to tweak the filesystem directly, no?
the ELF method _is_ elegant in many ways: 
- First, capabilities-enabled binaries are actually pretty rare, about 1%
  of all binaries. ext2fs (just like many other filesystems) makes no
  distinction between executable files and data files. (why would it)
  _What_ you do with a file is up to you. ELF is the preferred way to
  define executable files, and no, it's not built into the filesystem.
  Capabilities (as present in Linux) are inherently tired to executables,
  so putting it into the filesystem possibly introduces unnecessary bloat. 
- With the ELF method we'd immediately get capabilities
  on _all_ filesystems.
- The ELF method is also very flexible in some ways, eg. potentially it
  could be extended to include per-binary (mandatory) PGP signatures as
  well, which would be checked by the kernel (or better, by external
  hardware which has an unreadable master key) wether the binary is signed
  validly to run on the system. You want to extend the filesystem (and
  tools) for that again?
i think the way how capabilities are passed along exec() should be defined
by the binary loader, and not the filesystem. And exactly this is what
Pavel's ELF-capabilities patch does. We need minimal support from the
filesystem to pinpoint and maintain security-relevant executables (we have
this, the setuid bit), but further 'finegrained' access can i think much
better be done in the binary loader.
