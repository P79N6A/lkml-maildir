Hi Jason,
so far I ignored this because it worked, but I know my customer will
complain later anyway: What is the deeper meaning of this warning which
shows up once per registered UART port on my (x86) boxes?
void kgdb8250_add_port(int i, struct uart_port *serial_req)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_KGDB_SIMPLE_SERIAL
	if (should_copy_rs_table)
		printk(KERN_ERR "8250_kgdb: warning will over write serial"
			   " port definitions at kgdb init time\n");
#endif
...
When I look at kgdb8250_add_platform_port, it starts with a call to
kgdb8250_copy_rs_table, and I'm wondering now if that wouldn't be more
appropriate here.
