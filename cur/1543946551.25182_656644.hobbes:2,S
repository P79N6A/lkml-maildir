I could certainly go along with that ... reducing the proportion of
control files returning untyped strings.
My sense of kernel-user API's is that usually the less said the better.
Identify the essential information that one side requires from the
other via a runtime API, and pass only that.  API's represent a
lifetime commitment, so the less promised the better.
Perhaps my primary concern with these *.api files was that I did not
understand who or what the critical use or user was; who found this
essential, not just nice to have.
