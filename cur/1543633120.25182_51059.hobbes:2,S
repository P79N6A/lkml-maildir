Just to make sure I'm reading this correctly, you're saying that as
long as a buffer is OK for DMA, it should be OK to use a
sub-cache-line chunk as a DMA buffer via pci_map_single(), and
accessing the rest of the cache line should be OK at any time before,
during and after the DMA.

If I understand you, this means non-cache-coherent PPC is wrong as
well -- pci_map_single() goes through consistent_sync() and turns
into:
	case PCI_DMA_FROMDEVICE:	/* invalidate only */
		invalidate_dcache_range(start, end);
		break;
What alternate implementation are you proposing?
Thanks,
  Roland
