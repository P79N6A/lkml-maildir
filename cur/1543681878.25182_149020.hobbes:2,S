Conman,
Was running O6int, and after running my laptop for 1/2 day, I
experienced obvious slowdown, and not just xmms is jittering, 
licq is not functioning smoothly, etc. Was running licq, xmms, 
couple of aterm, ssh. Prior to these, was running lmbench.
Now running O6.1int, no problem at the moment, but noticable 
improvement especially when hiding/unhiding aterm (using wmaker).
Will keep you updated.
