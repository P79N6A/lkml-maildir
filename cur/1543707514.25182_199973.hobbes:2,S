Is backlight off or is it enabled and just screen content is
black ? (Do you have working backlight control keys on the kbd ?)

That's interesting. 
Enable radeon debug options and send me the output. Also try
commenting out the call to radeon_map_ROM(rinfo, pdev);
in drivers/video/aty/radeon_base.c and send me that output
as well (send me both, even if commenting out the call "fixes"
it).
