It's clear a painful change is needed.  **We don't have a choice.**
However, the fewer places we have to make source code changes the better.
What we agreed upon when this was discussed last year was the following:
dev_t is extended to a 12:20 (32-bit size.)  I personally would rather
have seen a 64-bit size (32:32) but was outvoted :(
New major 0 is reserved, except that dev_t == 0 remains the code for "no
device".  The unnamed device major becomes major 256.
If (dev_t & ~0xFFFF) == 0, the dev_t is interpreted as an old-format
dev_t, and is interpreted according to the following algorithm:
	if ( dev && (dev & ~0xFFFF) == 0 ) {
		major = (dev >> 8) ? (dev >> 8) : 256;
		minor = dev & 0xFF;
	} else {
		major = dev >> 20;
		minor = dev & 0xFFFFF;
	}
