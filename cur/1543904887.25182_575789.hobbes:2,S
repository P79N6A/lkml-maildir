inotify doesn't scale for lots of directories. I have about 18,000
directories under ~ on my laptop, and that's with a few source trees
that I use infrequently tarballed up.
But yes, if we had a full filesystem events notifier, then we could
just toss updatedb aside and have the benefit of a live index into the
system. It's been suggested before, at least by me. Other projects
want this as well, such as an on-demand virus scanner, or a live
backup to another site, or beagle/tracker who would like to index
documents on the fly. beagled already uses inotify, I think, but as it
takes over my system (in a bad way) whenever I tried to run it, I had
no choice but to remove it.
Perhaps it was choking on the 18k subdirectories, dunno.
