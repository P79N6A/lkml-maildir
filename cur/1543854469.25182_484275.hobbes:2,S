I'm not sure in what sense the test could be called "intentional".
IIRC, the problematic test run used only the following changes to the
defaults:
        cd /debug/fail_make_request/
        echo -1 >times
        echo 9 >verbose
        echo 1 >probability
        echo 1 >/sys/block/hda/hda2/make-it-fail

You could.  Generalizing the test tool might be preferable to requiring
the target configuration to change away from the default of the distro.

The patch raises the default stacktrace-depth from 10 to 32, and
although there is indeed no guarantee this is enough, in practice I
found the filesystem became hopelessly scrambled before ever hitting one
of the kjournald cases again.
Testing on a 400Mhz Pentium II, performance did not seem to be too much
of a problem; rather, logging failures over the serial line seemed the
bottleneck.
