Subject: BUG POWERPC: snd-powermac hangs since 'Merge 32 and 64 bits asm-powerpc/io.h'
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

When playing audio with the snd-powermac driver on a PowerMac G4
Quicksilver (Tumbler audio) the sound hangs after a few seconds.
- The time before a hang varies from one second to one minute.
- Killing the process playing sound and starting again will allow
sound to continue (for a few more seconds).
- Many different userspace audio systems and different audio sources
all encounter this bug--definitely a kernel issue.
- Vanilla kernels from 2.6.20 up to git HEAD show this behavior.
Others have reported this bug on distro kernels.[1][2]
I used git-bisect to find that the regression first occured after git
commit 68a64357d15ae4f596e92715719071952006e83c "powerpc: Merge 32 and
64 bits asm-powerpc/io.h" by benh.[3]
My kernel debugging skills are admittedly limited, but I scattered
printks through some relevant files and found that audio stops just as
snd_pmac_pcm_update in sound/ppc/pmac.c encounters a struct dbdma_cmd
with xfer_status == 0x8088. Normally it should be 0x84 (ie: ACTIVE |
RUN) or 0x0. Hopefully this means something to somebody. I'm willing
to do more debugging if more information is necessary, kindly CC me on
replies to this message.
Thank you for your time,
