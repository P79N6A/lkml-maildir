ide=nodma option would help you. It disables DMA on every
IDE interfaces.

for certain devices as boot-option in kernel 2.4.20 ?
E.g. you have three devices and want one of them (not all) to come up PIO
instead of DMA.
As using hdparm gives errors and delays for about 20-30 seconds on this
device
it would be better to turn it off right from the beginning.
