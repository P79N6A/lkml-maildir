For your information, you can found patches for pwc driver for 2.6.9-rc2 that
doesn't support binary interface, but add support for big resolution without
binary code. This add some source code to decompress data from the camera.
Please see 
http://www.saillard.org/pwc/
 for patches.
Note: if you have an old webcam that's not supported by the driver, i'll be
happy to write the decoder part the chipset1.
