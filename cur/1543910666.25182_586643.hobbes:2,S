Which event?
If you enable CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_CLASS, does everything work the same
again?

What specific udev rule are you matching against here that is now
broken?

The reason is we don't need the usb_device class anymore, but we still
provide for the compatibility if you have an old distro with old udev
rules that is expecting it (only rule we ran into was the one for the
usbfs /dev nodes, but there might be more.)
