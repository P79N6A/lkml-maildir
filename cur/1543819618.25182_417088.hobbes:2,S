DMA-mapping.txt exlicitely states it's planned with 
virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt, and IO-mapping.txt starts with:
<--  snip  -->
[ NOTE: The virt_to_bus() and bus_to_virt() functions have been
        superseded by the functionality provided by the PCI DMA
        interface (see Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt).  They continue
        to be documented below for historical purposes, but new code
        must not use them. --davidm 00/12/12 ]
<--  snip  -->
Patches to update Documentation/ are always welcome, but these two files 
already explicitely mention virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt, as deprecated, so I 
still don't see any urgent action required.
