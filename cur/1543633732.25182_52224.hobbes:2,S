Giving it a thought now, though, why not just sox out a very short (and
silent, if you want) wave file at boot? That way at least the first
thing played won't be something you really wanted to hear.
I've also noticed that while this is going on, whatever app is trying to
play sound generally gets bogged down, probably because the "noise"
plays about half as fast as the proper sound.
I've tried ALSA, but it always locks up after "Found IRQ X for pci
Y.Z:T" or whatever it is, for reasons unknown to me, even after adding
much printk. If anyone really cares, I might recreate my debug output.
Oddly enough, I'm also running 2.4.19-pre10-ac2+preempt+hobbs (the last
being a tiny hack to the mtrr code, and not related to the problem), and
I was running 2.4.18 at the time I got this laptop.
Are you saying that older kernels work properly? I've got a copy of
2.4.17 around here somewhere, I might look at the diffs...
Anyway, thanks for forcing me to think about it
