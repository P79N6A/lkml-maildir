Hi,
The most current linux distributions use nerwer glib's. I believe version 2.0 or 2.1? Therefore some programs which i wrote wont compile anymore.
Especially when i call: setfpucw
It is unknown in the more up to date linux distributions.
Does anybody know an alternative for this call which can be used in the newer libs? Perhaps this is the wrong channel to ask, exept for i didnt know where to ask as it goes for linux questions.
Any suggestion would be great.
Sincerely,
Mipam.
