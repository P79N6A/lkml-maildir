Hi,
It is possible to customize the bdflush deamon in order to made it
synchronizing one disk every 30sec and an another every days ? (without
hacking a lot the kernel sources )
Sounds strange, but on an embedded system I have a NAND Flash file
system and a hard disk. NAND can't be synchronized as regularly as the
hard disk because of the number of write limit. that's why the question.
I'll appreciate any clue,advice or link.
regards,
