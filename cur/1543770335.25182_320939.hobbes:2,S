It's just strange if you're able to see my SCSI devices only through
ATAPI.

It's "unintentional and not supported". Users are supposed to convert the
device name into scsi numbers (e.g. using lsscsi) in order to to enable
cdrecord to peek around until it finds that number instead of directly
opening the correct device.

Udev is supposed to handle physical to logical mappings. No other program
should need to care, except for lsscsi and similar programs.

If I need RT privileges, I'll need to suid untill the non-root RT support
is ready and I'll be glad that it's supported.

AFAI read, burnfree isn't supposed to do anything unless a buffer underrun
occures. If that's true, I'd prefer a warning message to really destroying
my CD.

I had to write a wrapper, and wrappers tend to indicate bad programs.
