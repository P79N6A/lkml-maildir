If it comes to the killing, it will start with the first row, or using your 
patch, with the only man in the first row, named kenny. Now imagine a 
phalanx of spawned kennies protecting a running-wild application from being 
killed ...
If you set the oom_adj to mark the goat under normal conditions, the system 
will adjust itself to abnormal conditions.

So your kill-kenny does not only require having exactly one goat system-wide 
and no process having the same process name, but also constant supervision.
I think it's a really great design!
