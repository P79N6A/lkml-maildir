I'm not sure how you knew I had 2GB of swap. ;)
I just always thought it was a good idea to have some just in case.
I did not know having swap would actually, in some cases, degrade
performance.
Are you saying that, if I turn off swap, the amount of cache used will
be the same, but that when other programs need more memory, the kernel
will take it from cache? If so, I will try, since that would be
an ideal solution.
And while O_STREAMING sounds good, I'm not really up for rewriting
all the rsync-like apps. I want my OS to deal with it.
Thanks.
