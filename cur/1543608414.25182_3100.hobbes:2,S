  Hi, all. Version 196 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
This is against 2.4.14-pre7. Highlights of this release:
- Fixed race in <devfsd_ioctl> when setting event mask
  Thanks to Kari Hurtta <hurtta@leija.mh.fmi.fi>
- Avoid deadlock in <devfs_follow_link> by using temporary buffer
				Regards,
					Richard....
