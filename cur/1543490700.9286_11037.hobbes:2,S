Subject: [RFC] Rights for hardlinks

  Hello.
  A few days ago I found out an unpleasant thing about hardlinks. See
the following situation:
  Lets have an innocent user A and evil user B. The user B writes
a program which will watch for example /tmp directory (or any directory
he has a read access to) and every file of user A hardlinks to some
other directory. Now user A can't effectively delete the file which is
especially unpleasant when there is quota on this system. The best
thing (OK after writing a system administrator) he can do is to truncate
the files but then he will sooner or later exceed inde quota. And usually
normal user won't notice anything till the quota will be exceeded...
  So I thing it would be good if hardlinks would be allowed only on files
the user has write access to. I've consulted the Single Unix specification
and I thing this behaviour is possible. There si witten:
  The implementation may require that the calling process has
  permission to access the existing file.
And later in description of EACCESS:
  ...the calling process does not have permission to access
the existing file and this is required by the implementation.
  So do you thing it has a sence and is possible to change the current
behaviour?
