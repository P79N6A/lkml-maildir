    Hi all :)
    I noticed lately that my traffic control rates were being very slow,
about 40% less than expected, and finally spotted the problem: cpufreq.
    Looks like HTB puts buckets according to the requested rate but
assuming that the CPU is running at its default clock or something like
that.
    Any way of fixing this without disabling cpufreq?
    I'm using kernel 2.6.20.14, Athlon64 1000/1800MHz, HZ=1000 and a
combination of HTB/SFQ in my traffic control.
    Thanks a lot in advance :)
