Time for I/O is not generally "wasted" as you say. It is given to
other tasks. Of course if there are no other tasks that want the
CPU then, I guess, you could call it wasted.
You can measure the time from when you make a system call to
the time your code gets control back. There are several
high-resolution (rdtsc) and low resolution (gettimeofday) ways
to do this.
