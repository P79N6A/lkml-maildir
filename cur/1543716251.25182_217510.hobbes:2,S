Only spin_lock_irqsave(), not spin_lock_irq().  The patch needs the old
flags to determine if interrupts were originally enabled, the flags are
not saved for spin_lock_irq().
In theory, spin_lock_irq() should never be called when interrupts are
already disabled, the corresponding spin_unlock_irq() will
unconditionally enable interrupts.  So it should be possible for
spin_lock_irq() to pass a constant flags value to
_raw_spin_lock_flags(), stating that interrupts were enabled before
spin_lock_irq().  Two problems with that :-
* The flags value for 'interrupts were enabled' is arch specific.
* I have seen buggy code that does spin_lock_irq() when interrupts
  are already disabled.  Unconditionally enabling interrupts while
  waiting for a contended spin_lock_irq() will perturb that code.
For now, the patch only improves the performance of spin_lock_irqsave().
