There is a gfp_mask there :)

This sounds like a lot of work, just to reimplement what a semaphore 
does for you :)
When you down(), you sleep, waiting for new work.  Each time new work 
occurs, on any cpu, you call up().  This is perfect for a kernel thread, 
which can sleep, just like a semaphore needs.  If you want to be 
interruptible by signals (such as sysadmin killing your thread, for some 
reason), then use down_interruptible().
There is typically one special case -- killing your thread on shutdown. 
  The typical solution is to set a flag thread_shutdown, and then up().
