Hi,
   I am new to Line and have some questions about how Linux system resolves
module dependency. Now I need to control the loading order of a driver so
that at system boot up time, it can be loaded after the sd and sg driver,
but before the low level HBA drivers (like qlogic HBA driver). I know that
there's module.conf that specifies module parameters, but I don't know which
parameter we can use to specify to control the loading order at boot up
time. Anyone has any ideas about that? Thanks.
