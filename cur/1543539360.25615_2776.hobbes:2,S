I don't think that booting from RH 6.2 CD-ROM will enable
USB support (?), but otherwise this is correct.
The OS should either be built with USB keyboard support so
that when the USB host controller driver disables legacy
emulation you still have a working keyboard, or the OS
should be built with _NO_ USB support, so that the BIOS
will continue providing legacy emulation support for your
keyboard & mouse.
