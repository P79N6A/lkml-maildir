Absolutely agreed.  Note that this goes hand in hand with
another issue, no matter how scary it may sound to other
people ... <drum roll>
	DOCUMENTATION
Because, without documentation we can only see what code
does and not what it's supposed to do.
This in turn means other people cannot identify bugs in
the code, simply because they're not sure what the code
is supposed to do.

Rik
