All I know is a number of different people, from different companies are
suddenly very worried about this.  The fact that they don't want to
comment on it in public leads me to believe that there is something
behind their fears.

It is a good start.  And as all OpenIB members are also IBTA members, I
am asking for the group's position as to this change.

I know that, almost all groups do.  Although $9500 does seem a bit steep
for spec prices :)

One specific IBTA member has issues with the adaption of Linux, and has
already done one thing to restrict a full IB implementation that would
work on Linux.  And as for insane, have you ever tried to actually read
that spec?  :)
