alpha user space .h define uint64_t as unsigned long,
include/asm-alpha/types.h defines it as unsigned long long.
Using a different definition (if it's possible) will be
confusing. Using the same definition as user space means
than code like:
uint64 t u;
printk("%lu", u);
will not compile on alpha. This problem is solved in C99
by using PRI_xxx format specifier macro, I'm not a great
fan of this idea.

surely vim allow to define your own set of type ?
