no crashes or build failures so far, so it's looking good!
There's one new compiler warning that i had to fix - but that's all. Find 
the patch attached below.
Btw., there's a handful of warning fixes i carry in tip/warnings/* topic 
branches - you can find them in tip/master via:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/tip.git/README
the ones affecting drivers/media/ are:
  f3e67e2: fix warning in drivers/media/video/usbvision/usbvision-i2c.c
  491af31: fix warning in drivers/media/video/cx18/cx18-mailbox.c
  728342a: fix warnings in drivers/media/dvb/ttusb-dec/ttusb_dec.c
  4dda565: fix warning in drivers/media/dvb/frontends/drx397xD.c
  a2e4f4a: fix warning in drivers/media/common/tuners/mxl5007t.c
  8317adf: fix warning in drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/anysee.c
this one appears to be GCC warning about a real bug:
  8317adf: fix warning in drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/anysee.c
the others are fixes for false positives - i reviewed the affected code 
paths and each commit log includes the analysis about why it is a false 
positive.
You might ask, how did these drivers/media/ commits get into tip/master? 
It is a side-effect of us keeping tip/master continuously -Werror clean 
for 32-bit and 64-bit x86 on allyes/allno/allmod and randconfigs as well, 
Those warning fixes (for the whole kernel - including drivers/media/) go 
into the tip/warnings/* branches.
Please have a look and git-cherry-pick the above commits if they are still 
relevant to your tree and if you agree with them. Thanks,
	Ingo

this warning:
  drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/af9005-fe.c: In function ‘af9005_fe_refresh_state’:
  drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/af9005-fe.c:223: warning: ‘loc_abort_count’ may be used uninitialized in this function
triggers because GCC does not recognize the (complex but correct) error flow
between:
     - af9005_fe_refresh_state() and af9005_get_post_vit_err_cw_count()
Annotate it.
