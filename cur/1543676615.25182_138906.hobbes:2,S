Me too.
I had it running for 24 hours with heavy stress testing
and a load above 7 all the time without problems. I then
stopped this test, and the box locked up 2 hours later,
and locked up about 7 or 8 times in the past few days :-(

This is not a "normal" symbios logic "sym53c8xx"
storage controller, but a "Symbios Logic 53c1030",
which uses the Fusion MPT driver. This is the first
time I'm running this driver, so I don't know if it's
considered stable (but I guess so)
Unfortunately I can't replace it as I don't have any
spare SCSI controller which fits right now.

I always have the system running with text console and
screen blanking disabled. Alas, I see no oops :-(
IMHO it doesn't look like the kernel crashes with an oops,
it does look more like it suddenly goes into an endless
loop or ridiculously high load somehow.
Last time I hade this freeze, I noticed that the system
answered my ICMP ping messages with a delay of more than
60 seconds. This looked like the system was very busy
at that time.
I'm now running with 2.4.20rc2, and also have syslog
routed to another system on the network. We'll see if
I can get any more information out of this.
