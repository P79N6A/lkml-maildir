We should get ext2 and friends to move the sucker _out_ of struct inode.
As it is, sizeof(struct inode) is way too large. This is 2.5 stuff, but
it really has to be done. More filesystems adding stuff into the union
is a Bad Thing(tm). If you want to allocates space - allocate if yourself;
->clear_inode() is the right place for freeing it.
