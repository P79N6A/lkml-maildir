And glibc relied on thisall the time, have a look at
<bits/siginfo.h>:
...
	 /* kill().  */
	struct
	  {
	    __pid_t si_pid;	/* Sending process ID.  */
	    __uid_t si_uid;	/* Real user ID of sending process.  */
	  } _kill;
With those older kernel we loose already with glibc :-(.

What kind of old binaries?  glibc 2.1 has externally 32bit uids - and
realtime signals (which use siginfo) are not supported by libc5 AFAIK.

m68k pads to 16bit.
Alan> You are wrong that it is safe to use the other bytes.
I'm not convinced.  Could you please check this again?  I don't see
another way to handle it portably.
With my patch programs using struct siginfo continue to work correctly
- and no recompilation is necessary.
