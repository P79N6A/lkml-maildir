I had proposed this compromise in good faith to Rusty at the very 
beginning of the debate but have not received an answer about it from 
him yet.
Since it appears impossible to get formal "approval" from a "community" 
composed of very diverse elements (for better and for worse) we will 
probably implement this short-term solution to restore tainting.
