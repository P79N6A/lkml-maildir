I don't know what was going on with your systems, but I've been using XFS
since the original 1.0 Linux release from SGI and I'd guess that I've had to run
xfs_repair less than 10 times and most of them were on Alpha and Sparc64
before issues with those arches got ironed out.
Right now I have XFS on both Alpha and Sparc64 and I haven't had
any issues on either box. Infact the Sparc64 box's XFS filesystem was
converted from reiser3 because the some part of the filesystem got
mysteriously corrupted in such a way that reiserfsck and the reiser3 driver
both thought it was fine but accessing a certain file would cause a lockup.
I really hope the reiser4 userland tools are a lot better than the reiser3
tools, that's an area that reiserfs has lagged behind hugely IMO.
