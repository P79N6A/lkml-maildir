Hmm, e.g. in OpenMP you would have another thread that just reads /proc/cpuinfo
in a loop and starts new threads on new CPUs?
That sounds ...... "expensive" 
The other use case in glibc I know of is the Opteron optimized
memcpy which can use different functions depending on the number of
cores.  But having a separate thread regularly rereading cpuinfo for
memcpy also sounds quite crazy.
