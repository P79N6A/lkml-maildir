I agree with you, but that is only true for edge-triggered APIC
interrupts, though - for level-triggered ones we will just re-take the
interrupt when we unmask it again.
Which is kind of sad. Is there some fast way to read the status of a 
level-trigger irq off the IO-APIC in case it is still pending, and to do 
the mitigation even for level-triggered?
(Btw, if there is, that would also allow us to notice the "constantly
screaming PCI interrupt" without help from the low-level isrs)
