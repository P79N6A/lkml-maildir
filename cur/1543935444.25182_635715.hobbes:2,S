In previous patch series, Arthur sent fixes for the mthca IB driver.
Other IB drivers like mlx4 also need this on Altix systems.  Basically
anything where the device DMAs some data into userspace and then DMAs
a "completed" status to another buffer in userspace leads to a problem
where the "completed" DMA might pass the actual data in the Altix
fabric, which leads to the userspace process working with bogus data.
