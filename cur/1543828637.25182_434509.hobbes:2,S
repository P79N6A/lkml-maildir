Yup.

Not that I'm aware of.  I just tried three CPUs doing
fadvise(FADV_WILLNEED, 1GB) with the fourth CPU trying to write the file,
but it didn't lock up as I expected.

tree_lock was initially an rwlock.  Then we made it a spinlock.  Then we
made it an rwlock.  We change the dang thing so often we should make it a
macro ;)
Let's just make it a spinlock and be done with it.  Hopefully Dave or
ccb@acm.org (?) will be able to test it.  I was planning on doing a patch
tomorrowish.
