GAS is one of the latest. There is a version (later, I think) that is
broken.
GNU assembler 2.9.5

This assembler was configured for a target of `i686-pc-linux-gnu'.
GAS is not lying. The code I fixed for the second time was broken.
There is no way that a "movl something, %ax" should ever even assemble.

And if you were told that warnings of this kind are preferable, preferable
to whom?
Cheers,
