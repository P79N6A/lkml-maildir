2.2.14aa1 supports 4g of RAM on IA32 and 2Terabyte of RAM on alpha (wihout
per-process limit on alpha) with production quality. Apply the below patch
against 2.2.14 if you can't run an unstable tree.

If you use 2.2.14aa1 you can apply these two incremental patches (they
should go on the top of 2.3.x as well) to allocate more ram per-process
(something like 3.5G). The two incremental patches are _not_ a good idea
if you need a large I/O cache (like for webservers). For scientific
application that only needs lots of RAM they should be fine.
