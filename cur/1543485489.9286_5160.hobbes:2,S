Arrghhh... Turns out that I also didn't.
$ mkdir foo
$ (cd foo; sleep 10) &
$ rmdir foo
$ mkdir bar
$ cd bar
$ rmdir .
rmdir: bar: Invalid argument
$ uname

Sorry. From /sys/kern/vfs_syscalls.c it looks like FreeBSD explicitly
checks for "."... Hmm... OK, it's not a big deal. Sorry, I misparsed you,
assuming that you want -EBUSY on rmdir() back. So it's -EINVAL and for
completely different reasons... Fine.

	Linus, could you apply this patch? IMHO it makes sense - it
explicitly forbids rmdir of one's pwd. Current directory of anybody else
is still fair game.
