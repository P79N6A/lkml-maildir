Yes, In Japan, situation is mostly the same.
We are trying to increase number of Linux community developer with
Linux Foundation Japan or CELF people in Japan.
In our discussion, the problem is not only Language.
In case of some developer, once he step forward (he try to send patch
or comment on LKML), he got some comment and he can work with
community even if it's slow (because of he was non-native).
So, I thought if some key document are available in Japanese like
HOWTO, that will help such early stage of developers.

I will be able to help this as a stand point of Japanese situation.
