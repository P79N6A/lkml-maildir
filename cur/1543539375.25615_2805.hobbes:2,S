This is all perfectly fine, but is completely irrelevant for hardware
that generates interrupts rather than expecting to be polled.
For such hardware, "real time" does, in fact, mean "fast enough",
since what matters is how quickly after the interrupt is generated the
relevant action (if any) is taken. This is a function of several things: 
  * the delay in the CPU noticing the IRQ (h/w dependent, mostly)
  * the delay between the CPU noticing the IRQ and the execution of
       the IRQ handler.
  * the delay between the execution of the IRQ handler 
        and the execution of the relevant code path.
  * the number of CPU cycles needed to execute the relevant code path
        directly.
  * the number of CPU cycles "stolen" by other code while the relevant
        code path is running (e.g. preemption driven by other IRQ's)
--p (whose "real time" control system for processing film canisters
     sorts about 15% of the rolls of consumer 35mm film in the USA)
