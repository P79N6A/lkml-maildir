Hi Barry, Alan, Tim.
Alan,Tim: Enclosed is a version that fixes both this alias
problem and other prospective ones without destroying the users'
environment or spawning a subshell. Can it be used?
This patch also deals with another problem I discovered: If it
gets run on a system where gcc isn't in the path at the time, the
output at that point is very dependant on which shell one is
using. This modified version will always display "<None>" if that
occurs.
Finally, I tweaked the script such that the modules list is
sorted into alphanumeric order.

I've worked out what was happenning there, and the unalias -a is
indeed ineffective in the subshell - but that's because all the
aliases are applied before the subshell is invoked, so there's
nothing for it to do...

I've just had this facility pointed out to me - it's one I'd
never met before and, as a result, was not aware of. As a result
thereof, I've reworked my copy thereof to use this for EVERY non
shell command in the script to prevent aliasing from causing
problems with any of them.
I note that your patch deals with the aliasing issue for the ls
command, but I can see no point in leaving the job half done,
hence the use thereof for ALL commands other than the in-built
echo command throughout that script.

It would fix it, but would require the user to change the
permissions of the script before running it as the said script is
currently distributed with 644 permissions, and patches from
earlier releases have no means of creating a script with any
other permissions. That's probably the biggest headache here.

The latter was my third version, but it's not necessary with the
anti-alias facility in use and I have thus withdrawn it.

No problem.
