With large system you mean >32GB right?
I think on a large systems some tuning is reasonable because they likely
have trained admins. I'm more worried on reasonable defaults for the
class of systems with 0-4GB
The /8 was to account for the overhead of page tables and mem_map and
leave some other memory for the system, but you're right it might be less 
with hugetlbfs.
