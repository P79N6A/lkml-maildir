Subject: Latest on Athlon Via KT133A chipset solution?

I noticed discussion of the various Via KT133A chipset problems related to
Athlon optimized kernels has trailed off. Are people successfully using
the patch that Alan Cox posted, or are there still problems?
I just ran into this last night (I thought all the Athlon chipset bugs had
been fixed in 2.4.4 prior to last night).
Anyway, just requesting status, and I'll gladly offer any testing help
that's needed.
