Dear Linux Technology Developers,
The reservation deadline for exhibiting at the Inaugural LinuxWorld 
Greenhouse is fast approaching. We're pleased to inform you that we 
are now able to offer you Greenhouse stations which have 2 meters of 
counter space -- initially it was only one meter. That's more bang 
for the buck and this allows you a greater floor presence to make an 
even bigger impact!
At this time, you should send a reply which indicates your interest 
in participating in the LinuxWorld Greenhouse. This is not a formal 
commitment, but please only respond if you are seriously interested. 
Once you've reserved a station, we'll generate and fax you an invoice 
and participant agreement for you to sign and return. No space is 
guaranteed until we receive your payment, with the signed agreement 
and have approved your participation.
All stations are on a first-come, first-served basis and their 
allocation and placement, and participation are at the sole and 
absolute discretion of show management.
The Greenhouse is designed to give emerging developers from the Linux 
community the opportunity to promote their technology in an 
affordable way. Participation in the Greenhouse is aimed at small 
companies (up to ten employees) which are on technology's cutting 
edge.
If you cannot yet justify a full booth on the exhibit floor, this is 
the way to ensure that you have a presence at the show. The exposure 
that your company will have to the attendees will be similar to 
larger companies but at a fraction of the cost.
LinuxWorld is the premier exposition targeted at Linux developments 
and will attract thousands of qualified attendees.IDG, whose history 
of hugely successful pavilions such as Developer Central at Macworld 
Expo, is offering up and coming exhibitors the chance to make their 
statement to the Linux community.
Please note that your deadline to RSVP to this invitation is on or before:
               *** Friday, January 14, 1999 ***
We're excited about the LinuxWorld Greenhouse -- as we are about 
LinuxWorld in general and we look forward to having you be a part of 
the show. Please take a moment and let us know where you stand today 
-- simply reply to this message by sending a response of "yes", 
"maybe", or "no thanks". If you're undecided, let us know immediately 
if you have any specific concerns or questions that we may answer for 
you to assist in your decision process. If you aren't able to 
participate, we value your feedback and would appreciate it greatly 
if you include some commentary as to the reasoning for your "no 
thanks" decision.
Best regards,
Greenhouse Management Team
