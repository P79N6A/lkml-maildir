What pointers are you talking about?  Let me ask a better question. If
I have a pointer to an ide_drive_t or ide_driver_t or just the struct
device, how do I get to the block_device (bdev) that points to it?
So I have the /sys/block/hda/device object (which really is a symlink to
the /sys/devices/...) but I want to get to the object that
represents /sys/block/hda/device/block:hda which is also a symlink back
to /sys/block/hda. Right now the only way I know to do that is to follow
the sysfs.
