Strange. There is not a lot in between those two registrations. The "cfq 
registered" comes from cfq_init(), and the "loop: loaded" thing comes from 
loop_init(), and in between them in the link there is just floppy.o.
And I don't see that _any_ of those three has changed. Yes, cfq got an 
__exit added to its exit function, and floppy got __initdata added, but 
neither of those should make any difference what-so-ever.
Just for interest, what happens if you disable floppy support? It doesn't 
look like you have a floppy on that system..
