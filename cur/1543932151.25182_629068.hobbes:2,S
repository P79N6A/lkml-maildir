I'm not sure that you are warning about the right things.  If you want
a real nightmare scenario in that area, consider this:
	int x[20];
	int *p = x + n;
	int *q = x + m;
	p - q
	((char *)p - (char *)q)/4
	((char *)p - (char *)q)/sizeof(int)
The first two are equivalent on all targets we care about.  However, an
attempt to make the second one "more portable" silently creates the
code that'll do something entirely different as soon as we get m > n...
