Subject: [PATCH] ia64: panic if topology_init kzalloc fails
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/1/5

From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
There really is no sense trying to continue if the kzalloc of
sysfs_cpus[] fails in ia64 topology_init.  The code calling
into here doesn't check errors very well, and one ends up with
a nonobvious boot failure that wastes peoples time debugging.
See for example the lkml thread at:
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/2/215
Since the system is totally dead when this kzalloc fails, not
having yet even booted, might as well announce one's death
boldly and plainly.
