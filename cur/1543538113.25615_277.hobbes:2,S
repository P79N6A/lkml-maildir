Even with these changes, you still can't call code inside (say) a DSP
library while keeping RT priority. Which matters to some problem
classes.
Victor: what about a patch that provides the kind of feature I'm
suggesting, but either costs very little to your kernel-space RT
threads (just a single test in the RTLinux scheduler) or can be
configured out entirely? This way, you can squeeze out the last bit of
performance, or can opt to pay a small performance penalty for
increased features. Everyone is happy, because there is choice.
