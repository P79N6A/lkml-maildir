What problem is that, exactly?
My Dell has an internal USB BT adapter that briefly appears
and then disappears again on resume (or stays if I have "enabled" it
via the BIOS key).
I wonder if that has anything to do with the (new in) 2.6.23 pauses
that machine has on resume (about every 10th time).
Cheers
