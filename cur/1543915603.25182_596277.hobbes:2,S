This seems to me to be an unnatural and inappropriate separation.
Move the whole of the security blob into the cred if you must have
a cred (which I was soooo glad Linux didn't have after having dealt
with it in Solaris) rather than having two blobs to deal with. If an
LSM requires a different treatment between when a task is a subject
and when it is an object the LSM should handle that itself.

So put all these fields into one blob and attach them to the cred.
Actually, if you put all these fields in the task blob maybe you
don't need to do your COW thing at all.
