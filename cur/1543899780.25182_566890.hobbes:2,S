Yes, I know what you mean; I was occupied with other work stuff on
Friday and not well on Saturday, and by that stage there was a backlog
of about 500 emails for me to wade through... :/

Sure.  As I pointed out in another email, it's unrealistic to expect
the freezer to be able to stop everything in a state where any
arbitrary mutex is free.  But as long as you don't need to do anything
that depends on getting a mutex while the system is frozen, there
should be no problem.
