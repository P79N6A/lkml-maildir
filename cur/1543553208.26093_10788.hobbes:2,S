Linus,
But it contains an erroneous part in microcode.c:
-       if (c->x86_vendor != X86_VENDOR_INTEL || c->x86 < 6){
+       if (c->x86_vendor != X86_VENDOR_INTEL || c->x86 != 6){
                printk(KERN_ERR "microcode: CPU%d not an Intel P6\n",
cpu_num);
It was not in Daniel's cleanup patch which I saw but came from elsewhere.
Are there Intel CPUs with family>6 which do not support the same mechanism
for microcode update as family=6? The manuals suggest that test for ">" is
correct, i.e. that Intel will maintain compatibility with P6 wrt microcode
update.
Perhaps Richard can clarify this?
Regards,
Tigran
