Good grief! I'm having this too, and I was desperate thinking I was the
only one, and ultimately offering the blame to gcc 3.4.1 which is what I'm
test-driving now on my laptop (Mdk 10.1c).
Now I remember that -mm4 has some issue about remap_page_range kernel
symbol being renamed to something else, which is breaking the build of
outsider modules (i.e. not the ones bundled under the kernel source tree).
Or so it seems.
Maybe someone on the lkml may have a clue and help here?
