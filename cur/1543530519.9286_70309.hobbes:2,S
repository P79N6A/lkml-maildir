For the first time since 2.3.35, kernel PCMCIA/Cardbus is actually
working for me!  I'm using a 3cxfe575bt (3Com Cardbus) fast ethernet
card with no problems. Even survives apm suspend-resume cycles, and
plays well with others (PCI sound devices and USB). Yippee! :) 
Previous problems as late as 2.3.48 included:
1) Keyboard and mouse lockups at random once pci-socket loaded;
   lockups were guaranteed once the 3Com card was inserted, and not freed
   when the card was ejected.
2) All APM calls would kernel-oops once pci-socket loaded (did anyone
   else see this behavior?).
Machine is a IBM ThinkPad 390E, with latest BIOS, using a TI 1251
Cardbus controller.  I'll test with a borrowed non-Cardbus card (3C589)
soon...
Many thanks to everyone's hard work in bug reporting, debugging and
fixing this!  Hopefully this success eventually propagates to all the
others with this annoying problem...
