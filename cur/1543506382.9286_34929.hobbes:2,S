	The point is, it makes it harder, and he can't subscribe other
lists to it, since those other lists wouldn't be on the posters list.
	There is always a balance between security and usability.  We
need to find that balance.  I believe this list to be one where in
general it is intended to be very open, but we may have to cut that
back a small bit in order to keep at least some of the junk off of
the list.
