1) A driver should ALWAYS put its /proc information under the
/proc/module/... tree.
2) This does not change /proc/modules at all, and has nothing to do with
/proc/modules.
Perhaps my example, with init_module(), confused you into thinking it
worked only for dynamic modules.
These days, modern kernel modules function exactly the same, whether
they are static or dynamic modules.  That's why module_init() and
module_exit() exist:  to enable a single codebase to support modules,
without #ifdef MODULE all over the code.
