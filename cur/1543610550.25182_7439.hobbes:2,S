Test for ->s_root is bogus and had been removed - check the patch I've sent.
However, that variant suffers from the following problem: if ->read_super()
fails after it had done _any_ iget() (root inode, journal, whatever) -
we are screwed.  Sure, we do iput().  And then we have inode stuck in icache,
with ->i_sb pointing nowhere.  When it finally gets evicted we call
inode->i_sb->s_op->clear_inode().  Oops...
