   Looks like David converted this macro into a no-op, then moved it into
   netdevice.h.
   Problem is, some non-network drivers were using it too.
They shouldn't, it's backwards compatability crap for net drivers
only.  Use explicit ->owner references elsewhere.
   Maybe we should put it back the way it was and go edit all the netdrivers?
Absolutely not.
Yoshfuji posted a patch on linux-kernel to fix this already.
