One data point:  rc3 worked just fine for me on one machine, OHCI
and EHCI under light testing (which included a keyboard).
Please be sure to provide full debug info with future reports,
including "lspci -vv" info, "dmesg" output showing usb init
and showing the failure, info about the USB devices you're
using, and "how I broke it" info.  "alt-sysrq-t" traces are good
for kernel hangs...
There seem to be a bunch of reports floating around that
are basically "it doesn't work for me" ... and devoid of enough
info that anyone could actually track down the problem
