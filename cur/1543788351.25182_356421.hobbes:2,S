No, it's not about fairness.
It's about BUGS IN YOUR CODE.
If you need fairness, you need to implement that yourself. You can do so 
many ways. Either on top of spinlocks, by using an external side-band 
channel, or by using semaphores instead of spinlocks (semaphores are much 
higher cost, but part of the cost is that they _are_ fair).
