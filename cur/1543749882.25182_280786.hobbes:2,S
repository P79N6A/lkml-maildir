drivers/parisc/superio.c does something similar.  I'm not sure I'd hold
it up as a shining example of how to write a driver ... constructive
criticism welcomed, thought there's some outstanding changes still in
the parisc tree that need to go upstream.

conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
