        Hi all
        Say I have a driver that realizes a "virtual irq" (/dev/irq).
        User application waits for interrupts by calling select() for
        that device. Obviously such a driver doesn't need much of code.
        What a maximum latency between irq occurance and
        userapp reaction I should expect?
