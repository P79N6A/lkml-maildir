Hi Michal,
You've implemented mq_open() in user space by combining open()+ioctl() 
syscalls. I think it's racy:
What if two processes call
{
    fd = mq_open("dummy",O_CREAT,0777,{.mq_maxmsg=10000});
    mq_send = mq_send(fd,buf,10000,0);
}
I think setting the queue options and creating a new queue must be 
atomic, i.e. we need a new syscall.
Could you replace the printk's with Dprintk or something like that? User 
space misbehaviour such as bad pointers should not generate printk messages.
