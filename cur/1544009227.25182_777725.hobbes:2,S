Sounds good.
It seems the /dev/console driver is registered only after all the pci,
video, acpi, ... drivers, so it's not surprising, that if any of these
driver in these subsystems calls request_module(), or a process in
initramfs tries to access the "dead" /dev/console node, things will go
wrong.
