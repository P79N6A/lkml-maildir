I have no clue what you sent it to, so I added linux-kernel again.

In case we wanted to use different types, we would also have to
change the accompanying %lu into %llu. Only changing jif to u64 will
cause a problem, as the compiler does _not_ automatically
promote/demote types in varargs that already have a certain size. In
other words,
int foo(unsigned long x)
{
        printk("%llu\n", x);  /* and */
        printk("%lu\n", x);
}
will throw a warning (rightfully if you ask me).
