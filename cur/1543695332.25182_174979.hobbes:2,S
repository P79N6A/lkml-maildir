Subject: 2.6.0-test8-bk3 net/ipv4/tcp.c change broken?

The 2.6.0-test8-bk3 change to delay pending signals checking in
net/ipv4/tcp.c appears to be broken.
On machine A I run X and an xterm. Within that xterm I rlogin to
machine B. On machine B I start emacs in text mode (emacs -nw).
When machine A runs 2.6.0-test8-bk2 or older, emacs works as usual:
it uses the xterm's entire size, and responds correctly and instantly
to control characters like ^S (I-search, not xoff) and ^G (Quit).
When machine A runs 2.6.0-test8-bk3 or later, emacs starts in a
tiny 24 rows by 80 columns mode, ^S incorrectly sends xoff, ^G
isn't seen by emacs until after a one second delay, and similarly
there is a one second delay between exiting emacs and getting the
next shell prompt. While running emacs, if I beat on it with ^G
and ^L it eventually (after about 5-10 seconds) goes into the
xterm's full rows/columns mode.
Reverting 2.6.0-test8-bk3's net/ipv4/tcp.c patch (included below)
fixes these problems.
