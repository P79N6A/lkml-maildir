i would like to change the page cache size for some
fs/performance tests under 2.4.0-test3/i386.
does anyone know how the right way to do that??
PAGE_SIZE is defined in asm/page.h as (1UL << PAGE_SHIFT)
PAGE_SHIFT for i386 is 12, so PAGE_SIZE is 4096
in linux/pagemap.h PAGE_CACHE_SIZE is defined as PAGE_SHIFT.
there is a (unclear) comment that indicates (in my opinion :) 
that page size _will_ probaly increase in future.
so that is what i've tried in order to get a page cache size of
- let's say 8192 in linux/pagemap.h:
original version:
#define PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT      PAGE_SHIFT
#define PAGE_CACHE_SIZE       PAGE_SIZE
#define PAGE_CACHE_MASK       PAGE_MASK
...
my try:
#define PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT      13
#define PAGE_CACHE_SIZE       (1UL << PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT)
#define PAGE_CACHE_MASK       (~(PAGE_CACHE_SIZE-1))
after rebuilding the kernel and rebooting the system 
hangs after mounting root (ext2). no messages.
thx,
Norbert
