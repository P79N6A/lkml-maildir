Er, this is a macro. :-)
In fact we rely only on atomic_read(&running_helpers) being still zero after
helper_finished() has woken us up, but I think that's acceptable.
IOW, if the wait_event_timeout() returns with retval different from zero, this
means that atomic_read(&running_helpers) returned zero at one point after
we'd set usermodehelper_disabled, which is enough.  OTOH, if it doesn't
return with retval different from zero, this means that either one or more
helpers are waited for to finish or they are coming and going very quickly,
which would be suspicious enough to cancel the suspend, IMHO.
