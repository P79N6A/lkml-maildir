Quite true. But there are bugs at kernel bugzilla which
1- People care about it being fixed
2- Tests beta kernels to see if its fixed
3- Reports success/failures
But still these bugs are unresolved. I do not say/mean kernel hackers do not 
care them or something like that but it would be better to get these kind of 
bugs ( with user base who tests them ) fixed before pre-2.6 releases.
