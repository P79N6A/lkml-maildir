Hi,
When I cat "/proc/meminfo", I found there were too many memory cached which may result in kernel oom and killing something. I want to disable the cacheable feature, or limit the maximum of memory sizes which could be used for cached data. But anyone know how I shall do in the kernel? I use 2.4.20 kernel. Thanks.
