Hi,
the nice thing about text interface as opposed to a struct is that the userland can parse a "CPU_FAMILY=6" as good as 0x6, but if you decide to change the format of the /proc entry, with a binary interface, this means you MUST update the userland as well, while with a text interface and some trivial error processing, adding a field would in the worst case mean that the userland app will not profit from the new info, but it will NOT BREAK.
I do realize this means that the userland apps have to be carefully designed and implemented, but at least, a kernel upgrade wouldn't imply an upgrade of half the OS tools. Once programmers start to realize that error processing is a must anyway, this is a trivial step (and no, "Your proc is broken, go fix it" messages are not error processing ;).
