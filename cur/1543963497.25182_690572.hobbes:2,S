In practice, though, such MTRRs are never seen.  Even in the presence of 
such pathological MTRRs, I'm sure one can figure out a *much* smarter 
overlap algorithm.  I'd have to sit down and think about it, but I'm 
pretty sure one could; the basic observation, though, is that any set 
mask bit that are in a position <= floor(log2(range_len))-1 don't matter 
at all, since the range WILL end up covering both the 0 and the 1 case 
in this bit position.  At this point, you can test only a limited number 
of points (I *believe* you can reduce it down to only the beginning and 
the end, but I haven't proven that, so don't count on it yet.)
The key, of course, is to look for the case of multiple MTRRs matching 
the range.
