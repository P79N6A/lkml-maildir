Well, "..." is mostly used by script kiddies -- they usually have
their rootkit collection there :-).
It would be nice to decide on one escape into "meta" namespace,
uservfs and similar projects probably should be converted to use same
escape.
[Uservfs currently uses things like cat /tmp/foo.tgz#utar/bar.gz#ugz
... essentially using # as another separator. It should probably be
converted to use same meta escape].
