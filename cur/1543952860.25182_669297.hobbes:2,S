First of all, I didn't see Andrew's message until awhile after yours,
due to some kind of email problems...

Thanks.  That's news to me.  Not that I mind the news.

No, nothing in tree like that.
Would such an auto-generator use source files or compiled modules?
Using the latter means that (a) something like allmodconfig must be done
and (b) it only works for the compiled $ARCH(es), whereas using source code
has neither of those "problems."
I can work on updating
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/scripts/module-params
 (from Oct-2006).
Comments welcome.
