Hi,
I know about the limitations that have to be considered when using DMA
memory (contiguous space and <16MB). I'm interested in this topic because
I get out of DMA memory messages almost every day when writing to XDF
disks with mtools or xdfcopy.
Theoretically, it must be possible to just move some adjacent pages out of
<16MB memory area, update the page tables and use that freed memory as DMA
memory henceforth, when DMA memory is requested.
Are there any objections to this idea, has anyone already done it?
