Subject: Boot failure during IDE initialisation

I have been unable to get any of the development kernels to boot since
early 2.3.99.  Now I have narrowed down the point at which the system
reboots.  It is during IDE initialisation, specifically:
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
I've just tried 2.2.17-pre6 with the IDE patch and it gets slightly
further:
ide0: BM-DMA at 0xffa0-0xffa7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
ide1: BM-DMA at 0xffa8-0xffaf, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:DMA
is printed and *then* the system reboots.
It's a P233-MMX and here is what dmesg shows for 2.2.17-pre9 (which
works without any problems):
hda: IBM-DJAA-31700, ATA DISK drive
hdb: Maxtor 91536U6, ATA DISK drive
hdc: QUANTUM BIGFOOT2550A, ATA DISK drive
hdd: IBM-DALA-3540, ATA DISK drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
EZ-drive is present on hda and hdb.
Configs available on request.
