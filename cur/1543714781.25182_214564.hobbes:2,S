Bravo!  You've made my day :-).  What kind of devices do you have
available?  When I repair the #$%@! capstan on my Archive cartridge
tape unit, I need to test with that...  The need for tape backup was
the reason I bought my card in the first place.  At the moment, the
only device I've got that's even halfway convenient to use in testing
is an Olympus optical disk unit (removable media).  The driver works
reliably with that, but I've got a sneaking suspicion that a tape unit
would stress things a bit more (error handling and such).
Per Christoph's critique, I've successfully combined the three driver
source files into a single source file, and eliminated all the
deprecated includes as well as the structure typedefs.  Still to do:
add support for multiple HBAs, and eliminate distasteful hacks in
detection code.  Dunno how I'm going to test the multiple HBA code...
