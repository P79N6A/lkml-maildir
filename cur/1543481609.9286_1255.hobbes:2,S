Further from my previous email, here's an strace from mv
stat("testing", 0xbffff730) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
lstat("autoexec.bat", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0660, st_size=111, ...}) = 0
lstat("testing", 0x804bb28) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
rename("autoexec.bat", "testing") = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
Cheers,
Alex
