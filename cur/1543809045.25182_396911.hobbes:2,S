Tiny changes.
- The icmp remote DoS fix.
- Dropped a patch that broke booting with 'quiet' bootparam
- the 'dm_crypt: zero key before freeing it' change

I'd love more hours in the day to push more of them upstream, as
I bet would other vendors kernel maintainers.
Should anyone want to drink from the firehose that is 'redhat kernel bugzilla',
let me know, and I'll see if I can't get a fedora-kernel-bugs mailing
list or the like set up.
Some subsystem maintainers (ACPI for example) really help out here,
and add acpi-bugzilla@list.sourceforge.net to all the Fedora ACPI bugs.
(I believe that list actually gets bug reports from other distro bugzillas too)
(There's also a few 'meta-bugs' -- enter FCMETA_ACPI as a bug id
and you get a link to a dependancy tree showing all the ACPI bugs
reported. There's a bunch of those for various subsystems which
makes it a little easier to track, though again, it's time-consuming
just sorting through stuff).  Off the top of my head, theres one
for USB, SCSI, ACPI, ALSA, SATA (All with FCMETA_ prefix)
Some of them are a bit sparse due to lack of time & effort so far.
