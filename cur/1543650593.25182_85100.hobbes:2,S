Why are files limited to 4GB? (2^32). Simply because I never
thought anything bigger was needed :-)  Initially files were limited to
2^24 (like cramfs), but because of compressed metadata I thought I could
justify an extra 8 bits in the inode, in consideration of the
extra functionality.
Going from 32 bits to 40 bits say is a bigger jump - an extra
2 bytes per file inode (1 byte for the extra file size, and 1
byte because the file start block pointer must increase
by 1 byte as well).  Considering the fact I've tried to squeeze
every last byte out...
However, I could add the extra two bytes if people thought
it was worth it.
Alternatively,  squashfs uses different inodes per file type.  I could
add an extra "big file" type to deal with files bigger than 4GB.  This
would mean > 4GB files are supported, with only one extra byte per inode
for smaller files.  I'll think about it...
