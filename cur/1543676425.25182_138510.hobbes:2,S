Yeap, that is a way ...

Aha ... that is the bit I was missing - cool, thanks; the only thing,
although I don't think I will have a problem with it, is that the 
notifiers are going to be called before my __initcall, probably (or
even worse, there is no defined order) ... well, I don't think that
will be a problem.
