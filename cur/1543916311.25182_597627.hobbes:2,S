As a bare minimum requirement the list presented here shall use same
names as used in /proc/cpuinfo
On this box I read:
vendor_id	: GenuineIntel
model name	: Pentium III (Coppermine)
This info must be present in Kconfig text (help text) too.
I always have trouble selecting the right CPU before so I welcome this patch
that give me more info - and maybe a bit too much.
