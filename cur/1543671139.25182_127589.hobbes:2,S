We have emulation layer for non-ALSA mixers. This layer turns mute off 
automagically when volume is greater than zero. This layer doesn't work 
100%, because ALSA API is more extended and there is no way to map the 
extended features to limited API.

Most of PCI cards which are based on AC97 supports muting for analog i/o.

We mute almost everything. Today, we preset only some of digital controls
and we preserve volume settings for USB devices (might be changed, of 
course).
Our policy is: Don't allow to users to jump from skin when default volumes 
are invalid. Because we cannot determine the settings of an user amplifier
(analog path), the most safe is mute everything.
