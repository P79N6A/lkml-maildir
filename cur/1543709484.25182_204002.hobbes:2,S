Subject: Server suddenly freezes but awakes upon SysRq!?

Hello
We have some problems with a server that started to suddenly freeze
every now and then which means that it does react to ping and tcp
connects but does not allow a login nor returns the shell or does syslog
write anything to disc or network.
Funnily it always immediately awakes when we presses 'AltGr+SysGr+h'
although a login on the console did not work before.
What could be the cause of this "sleep" mode if a sysrq ends it?
We noticed that at least 1-2 freezes occured right after accessing the
external usb2.0 backup harddrive.
The server is a dual-p3 with a 3ware ide-scsi RAID and very low load as
postfix+apache server.
bye,
-christian-
