Thanks for the excellent work and excellent explaination. If you
need some help with rework once we discover the latest and gratest
GAS, let me know. I write this kind of stuff for a living
although I use the "backwards" assemblers. I have been hacking with
gas for some time now so AT&T syntax isn't too bad anymore.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
