* Pablo, the bug you saw was bad interaction between blacklisted NCQ
device and dynamic queue depth adjustment.  Patches are submitted to fix
the problem.  Just drop the blacklist patch.  Your drives should work
fine in NCQ mode.  My gut feeling is that your problem is power related
from the beginning.
* Marcus, you're on via's ahci controller, right?  The problem you saw
was bad interaction between blacklisted NCQ _controller_ and dynamic
queue depth adjustment.  Patches submitted.
Thanks.
