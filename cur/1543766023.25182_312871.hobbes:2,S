I don't see that in the license.  As point 5 showed: "Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License." So you don't need to
do anything more than supply the source of the LPGL work. In fact, it
may not be a good idea to add a bugfixed version of the libary without
going through the vendor. You don't know if the application that uses
this depends on the side effects of the bug.
