Hi,
I recently changed the kernel from 2.2.15 to 2.2.17 and added new promise 100
card. During 3 days 2 production servers crashed 4 times and had several
lockups when there was zillion messages like
VM: do_try_to_free_memmory failed for XXX 
we then changed the kernel to 2.2.18pre3 + ide + raid patches, ( we
couldn't revert to 2.2.15 because we needed promise 100 cards to be working.)
The situation persists, we have had two crashes on those servers today.
The machines are usually very heavily loaded, 5-50.
Please help.
Are there any patches to fix this behaviour ?
Chris
