Hi Andrew,
here are a bunch of patches from linuxtv.org CVS. Nothing
exciting, just bugfixes, cleanups and support for a number
of new card variants.
One hunk from my previous patchset didn't make it into
2.6.12-rc4, but still lingers somewhere in rc3-mm3,
thus the "make dvb_class static" patch will be rejected
when applying to -rc3-mm3:
dvb-core/dvbdev.c from 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/21/321
Please apply.
Thanks,
Johannes
