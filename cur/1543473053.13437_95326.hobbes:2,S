I switched to kernel 2.1.132-ac2 :
The problem i have so far:
- Bad TCPv4 checksums messages 
(on a ppp link, they happen mostly during heavy ftp transfers)
- RealPlayer v5 doesnt work properly
a strange problem, if i let it sit there alone it works
but as soon as i switch window, move the window or try
to multitask (:) the player stops and prints the following
to stdout :
****audio: write error: 502 bytes errno: 11
- Until 2.1.131 applying a patch was fast at first but it was getting
slow to a crawl in the end. When i synced i could heard the system
syncing -very- slowly.
(i'm use IDE disks)
I also experienced netscape looping forever and taking 100% cpu, however
i dont know if its kernel related or not.
I can give more detailed reports on request (just tell me what you
need:)
greets
Enrico
