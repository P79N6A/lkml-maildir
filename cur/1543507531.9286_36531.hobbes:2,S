Well, there is a point. This is a advanced good old { "CON:", "COM1:", etc. }
MSDOS idea. And
     1. There are only 256 majors in the system. Enough for today,
        but that is not a _huge_ number, is it ?
     2. In other UNIXOIDs you could not open device file twice. ( I think
        you understand  that I mean ). That's why CLONE devices was invented.
     3. I don't want to care about major number/device driver at ALL when
        I try to write some 'pure' software kernel module without
        hardware issues. That is not a NATURAL WAY.

There is no such metter. Just look below.

Very interesting. I'll take a look.

Even you don't need to find out a major+minor, look for such
file in  /dev tree, etc.. Your user program would simply open
"/dev/MY_UNIQUE_DEVICE_NAME" and you could  create that device
file every time from module's INIT_MODULE() routine by  calling
sys_unlink & sys_mknod functions (indirectly, of course ).
