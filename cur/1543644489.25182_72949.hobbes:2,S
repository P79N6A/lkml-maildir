   True, but I was wondering whether driver writers will have an implicit
   assumption on readX/writeX being atomic.  I don't think anyone ever
   promised that, but I suspect all existing implementations are indeed
   atomic (it's true even for old Alphas which don't have sub-word
   load/stores).
   
On many platforms, two consequetive __raw_writel()'s might even
combine to an atomic 64-bit store to PCI space. :-)
I don't think the proposed 32-bit behavior is off the mark, and
anyways x86 can actually make the 64-bit store I believe if it
wants at least on more recent processors.
