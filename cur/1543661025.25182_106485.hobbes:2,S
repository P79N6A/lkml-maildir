It's called the PGP web of trust.  There's already some 107 signatures on
the PGP key - who else would you want signing it?  The point is that we've
already (presumably) proved via the web-of-trust that PGP key 517d0f0e is
in fact the proper key, and that for an intruder to post a valid signature
of a trojaned .tar.gz would require them to *ALSO* compromise the machine
that the signing is done on (hopefully a different machine than ftp.kernel.org).
Yes, an intruder could leave a forged signature with a random key easily. But
to leave a forged signature with the key that's already on my keyring is a
lot harder...
