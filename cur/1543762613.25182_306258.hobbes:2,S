Please try attached patch. What you see may be the linker deciding to
re-shuffle some sections a bit more than usual.
Patch has been in -mm for a while.

#   kbuild: Avoid inconsistent kallsyms data
#   
#   Several reports on inconsistent kallsyms data has been caused by the aliased symbols
#   __sched_text_start and __down to shift places in the output of nm.
#   The root cause was that on second pass ld aligned __sched_text_start to a 4 byte boundary
#   which is the function alignment on i386.
#   sched.text and spinlock.text is now aligned to an 8 byte boundary to make sure they
#   are aligned to a function alignemnt on most (all?) archs.
