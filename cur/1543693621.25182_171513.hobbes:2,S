I think you have wrapped yourself in nomenclature, and by using your own
definitions of terms in strictly traditional meanings you have  created
problems which aren't really there.
If you don't like it don't use it. If you insist on your own definition
of "thread" then your paragraph above may have meaning, but since your
definition doesn't seem to match the way Linux is going to work, I'm not
sure it's meaningful in any relevant context.
