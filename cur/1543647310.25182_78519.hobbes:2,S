   It first calls devinet_ioctl() with cmd as SIOCSIFADDR. In this we reset 
   netmask and broadcast address.
I understand now.
But, I believe that this resetting of the netmask/broadcast address
is required behavior for this SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.
You can use rtnetlink messages to do this more precisely
(f.e. via a tool such as 'ip') and thus to avoid the excessive
netlink messages.
After scanning relevant portions of Stevens Volume II, it seems
the code you are deleting are required behavior of these ioctls
and it is how BSD behaves.
