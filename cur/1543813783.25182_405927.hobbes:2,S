would it be useful to add a compile-time-option and additionally
a kernel-command-line option for some bogus-code like
if ( commandline-enable || compiletime-enable ) 
{
	/* Enable all Soundcards- Found */
}
?
- no default behaviour is changed
- general purpose Kernels can have Quirks integrated if needed

PS:
can someone give me a (kernel-programming-beginner-level) hint, for the first 
question how to ensure to only execute if running on the right Mother-board?
Af far as I believe the quirk so-far only checks the cipset, so it might
behave wrong on other Mainborads!
