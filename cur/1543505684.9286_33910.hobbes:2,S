IMHO, the point where drivers want to do readl/writel (or similar
things like insl/outsl) without byte-swapping is where they are using
those things to transfer a buffer of bytes, just doing it four bytes
at a time (or 2 in the case of readw/writew/insw/outsw etc.)  In that
case you don't want byte-swapping.
You do want byte-swapping on a big-endian platform where you are
accessing a quantity which is interpreted as a 32-bit (or 16-bit)
integer.
I think readl/writel are primarily defined for transferring 32-bit
quantities, and therefore should do byte-swapping on big-endian
platforms (as indeed they do at present).
For the cases where a driver wants to transfer 4 bytes from a buffer
of bytes, it would be *extremely* convenient to have readl_ns,
writel_ns, etc. variants which don't do the byte-swapping.  It would
save a lot of #ifdefs in driver code.  On a little-endian platform,
readl_ns == readl, etc., of course.
Can I send you a patch to add the *_ns variants?
Regards,
Paul.
