I would expect glyphs to be rendered into bitmaps on-demand and cached.
I would expect the cache to have such a HIGH hit rate that it's not 
worth dedicating hardware to the relatively infrequent event of 
rasterizing a glyph.
Now, providing the means to efficiently use those cached bitmaps, on the 
other hand, is definately worth the effort.
