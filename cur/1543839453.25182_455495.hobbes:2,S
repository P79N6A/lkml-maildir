Ah, OK - the debian-glibc thread the OP referred to began:
"Starting with 2.6.18, the official kernels do not have the sysctl 
syscall anymore (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/15/54
) or rather it has 
been replaced by a dummy syscall that always fail and print a message 
in the log, and thus the sysctl() function will not work anymore."
However the referenced link is about an -mm kernel.
Sorry for the noise.
