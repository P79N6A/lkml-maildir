Pivot_root seems to be broken in 2.6.15-rc1-mm2.
I havea initramfs filesystem, mount a ext3 filesystem (which has /mnt)
at '/root' and
  cd /root
  pivot . mnt
and it says -EINVAL.
After putting in copious tracing printk, the offending test is:
	if (user_nd.mnt->mnt_parent == user_nd.mnt)
		goto out2; /* not attached */
If I remove this, it works (or seems to).
Presumably the initial root file system is 'not attached'.  But that
shouldn't be a problem, should it?
Could this be related to the new shared mounts stuff???
