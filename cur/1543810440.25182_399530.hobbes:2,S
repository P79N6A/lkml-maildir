Reload a complete tree of devices like lvm2 does:
It loads inactivate tables wherever it needs to in the tree,
then suspends the devices in the correct order (according to
the dependencies of the live tables to avoid ever 'trapping' I/O 
between two devices), then resumes them in order.

I should have said: try hard to avoid allocations in any code run 
during the 'DM_SUSPEND' ioctl - if you really have to, your options
include PF_MEMALLOC or a mempool, as appropriate.

Either that, or:

This dodges the allocation problem because it happens in the DM_TABLE_LOAD 
ioctl where I was able to remove the restriction recently.
