Sure sounds like a great idea. I just signed up for a large partition (>
1700 GSIs) to try this over the weekend.
The problem with oapic_renumber_gsi() is that it didn't actually migrate
to x86_64 because it doesn't have sub-archs so far. But using actual
number of interrupts vs. range is definitely promising idea. I was also
thinking that all the complexity is actually located on the first
IO-APIC, this may have some potential for compression only coming into
play on non-zero IO-APICs. But using the total number of IRQs used is
definitely the most logical thing to try...I will test this shortly -
Thanks, --Natalie
