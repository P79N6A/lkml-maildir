It should not happen provided the total amount of dirty data for
detachable devices is restricted to allow enough room for opening a
dialog.
That's no different, in principle, than the restrictions that are used
to ensure some types of kernel memory allocation always succeed.
There's no exact calculation, just a notion of "this many megabytes
should be enough for a dialog".
