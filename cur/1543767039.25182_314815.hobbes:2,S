I've looked at the code.  Look in fs/proc/base.c (Linux 2.6.10),
proc_root_link().
I don't see anything there to prevent you from traversing to the
mounts in the other namespace.
So why is it failing?  Any idea?

Having a file/directory which represents namespaces held by another
process makes much more sense to me than new system calls and
inventing yet another id space to represent namespaces.
And, given that you can look at the filesystems another process can
see by doing ptrace on it, it might as well be accessible in a more
natural way.
