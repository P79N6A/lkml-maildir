I agree that turning this flag on does not seem like an interesting
solution.
Well, I wonder how important this issue of not sharing L1 instruction
cachelines with scheduler code is. If we care as much about it as Ingo
states, I wonder why we leave about 22 BUG() macros in sched.c
(calculated from the number of ud2 instructions generated on x86), which
adds up to 7 bytes at the end of many scheduler functions (7 bytes
coming from ud2, jmp and .p2align on x86).
And 22 markers in sched.c is already much more than needed. I actually
propose only 5 in my patchset.
