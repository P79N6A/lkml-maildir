I have an HP zv5200z laptop running a x86_64 kernel.
In order to get cardbus devices to work, I had to patch the kernel to get 
the cardbus to actually see those devices.  (We will call this patch 
"cardbus.patch".)
I went to patch the current FC5T1 kernel and found that the patch no 
longer applied.  On further investigation I found that the patch had been 
added to the kernel, but some helpful soul had added a subroutine that 
made it absolutely worthless to anyone on x86 architecture.
in drivers/pci/probe.c at line 408 there is the following code:
        /* Attempts to fix that up are really dangerous unless
           we're going to re-assign all bus numbers. */
        if (!pcibios_assign_all_busses())
                return;
The problem with this is that for x86 and x86_64 this function is defined 
as 0.
include/asm-x86_64/pci.h:18:#define pcibios_assign_all_busses() 0
include/asm-i386/pci.h:14:extern unsigned int pcibios_assign_all_busses(void);
include/asm-i386/pci.h:16:#define pcibios_assign_all_busses()   0
include/asm-ia64/pci.h:18:#define pcibios_assign_all_busses()     0
This "fix" makes the patch absolutely useless to me.
Is there a way to get this to only run the fixup where needed or to make 
this patch less problematic or just remove the test entirely?
My cardbus devices will thank you.
