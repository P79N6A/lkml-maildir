After an extended delay I have been able to confirm that the above
commands do not cause 2.4 (Debian's 2.4.27) to do anything unusal.
Mount just reports:
  mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0,
       or too many mounted file systems
And there is nothing exciting in dmsg:
  loop: loaded (max 8 devices)
  HFS+-fs: unable to find HFS+ superblock
  HFS+-fs: unable to find HFS+ superblock
  HFS+-fs: unable to find HFS+ superblock
Thus it seems that 2.4 does not suffer from this bug.
