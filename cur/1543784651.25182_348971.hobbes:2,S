I am indeed unaware of the problem.  Could you try the latest kernel with 
the ntfs patches in it (Linus already merged them in the official git 
tree) and tell me if it now works?  Thanks a lot in advance!
Note you will need to try the ntfs driver itself and not ntfscp as libntfs 
does not have these changes yet hence ntfscp will not work just the same 
(it does not use the kernel driver at all, it only uses libntfs).
Best regards,
