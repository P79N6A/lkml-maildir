intel-agp would hang during modprobe until I backed this one out.
Am still seeing a hang trying to modprobe yenta-socket during early boot.  I'm
not seeing any obvious candidates to back out here - the -rc4-mm1 version is
identical, and -rc4-mm1 boots OK for me.
I wasn't seeing any output from alt-sysrq-T, but it occurs to me that maybe
the console level wasn't set nicely yet - this is happening pretty early in
rc.sysinit.
Is there an undocumented requirement for a newer modprobe?  I'm currently
using the Fedora -devel tree's version:
# modprobe -V
module-init-tools version 3.2-pre7
