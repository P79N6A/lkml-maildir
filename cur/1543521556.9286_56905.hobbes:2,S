Any effect will be dependent on the size of the caches. Any effect
would be very small (might be non-existent) on a Celeron (128kB L2
cache), and might be quite noticable on a 2MB L2 Xeon. Cache sizes
inbetween would be expected to have intermediate affect.
Anybody benchmark how much of the L2 cache gets dirtied in a
"typical" (probably read/write) syscall that also goes through
schedule()?
