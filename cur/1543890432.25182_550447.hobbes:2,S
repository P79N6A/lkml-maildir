We are mixing the time-of-dat at boot time into the pool already,
using ktime_get_real() in random.c:init_std_data().  The problem
though is if the board doesn't have a valid RTC clock, or its battery
is dead, and the time-of-day clock is getting set by userspace, then
unless userspace also mixes in the time once it's been set via ntpdate
or whatever, it won't help the entropy pool.
