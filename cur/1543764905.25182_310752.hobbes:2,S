I suppose if pairing of entry and return probes is important for a user,
he/she can always do the following:
static int ready;	// 1 = everybody registered
			// 2 = everybody knows we're registered
...
	ready = 0;
	... register_kprobe(&kp)...
	... register_retprobe(&rp) ...
	/* instant XXX -- see below*/
	ready = 1;
and in kp.pre_handler do
	if (!ready) {
		// return probe not registered yet
		return 0;
	}
	ready = 2;
	<body of handler>
and in rp.handler do
	if (ready != 2) {
		// Probed function entered during instant XXX,
		// so kp.pre_handler didn't act on it.
		return 0;
	}
	<body of handler>
Keeping a whole group of kprobes, jprobes, and retprobes in the starting
gate pending a "ready" signal (e.g., for SystemTap) could probably be
handled similarly.
Unregistration shouldn't be an issue.  At any time you can have N active
instances of the probed function, and have therefore recorded E entries
and E-N returns.  Hien's code handles all that on retprobe
deregistration, but the user's instrumentation should never count on #
probed entries == # probed returns.
