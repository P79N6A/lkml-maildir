Merry post-christmas.
I released a new version of the bzip2 linux kernel patch for kernel
version 2.4.20.
It is available at: 
http://shepard.kicks-ass.net/~cc/
 (if it is offline,
please try again later).
So I wish you all a happy new year.
Have fun.

PS: The old 2.4.18 patch is also still available.
