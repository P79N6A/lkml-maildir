IIUC, __per_cpu_data is insufficient for Alpha as stands, to use
thread-specific gcc tricks (__thread prepended to the decl, even
though they had a perfectly good __attribute__ extension already).
So, I guess we're stuck with something like:
DECLARE_PER_CPU(int x);
If we're going to do this, we can also mangle the name as well to
avoid accidental "direct" accesses:
eg:
	#define DECLARE_PER_CPU(var) 
		var##__percpu __attribute__((section(".percpu")))
	/* If not SMP: */
	#define per_cpu(var) var##__percpu
(From my reading, ## on "int x" and "__per_cpu" is well-defined).
Thoughts?
Rusty.
