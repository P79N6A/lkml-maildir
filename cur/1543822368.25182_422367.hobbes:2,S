Hi Greg,
XenStore is a shared namespace (similar to sysfs or open firmware) 
between domains.  The interdomain communication primitives exposed by 
Xen are very lowlevel (virtual IRQ and shared memory).  XenStore is 
implemented on top of these primitives and provides some higher level 
operations (read a key, write a key, enumerate a directory, notify when 
a key changes value).
We use XenStore to implement our virtual drivers (this infrastructure is 
called XenBus).  The drivers are split between a backend and frontend.  
The frontend is the portion of the driver that runs in the guest and the 
backend is the portion of the driver that runs in the host (and actually 
virtualizes the underlying device).
The xenbus_mkdir, etc. functions you see operate on XenStore.
Regards,
Anthony Liguori
