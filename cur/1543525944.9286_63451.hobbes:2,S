  Hi, all. Ever since kernel 2.3.42 (or thereabouts) PCMCIA hasn't
been working for me, so I've had to drop back to 2.3.36. With the
latest-and-greatest (2.3.46-pre2) kernel I get the following kernel
messages:
=====================

=====================
whereas for 2.3.36 I get:
=====================

=====================
This is on a Dell Inspiron 3200. Is there some extra setup that I have
to do to get this working? I've installed the latest cardmgr tools
from pcmcia-cs, but that doesn't help.
