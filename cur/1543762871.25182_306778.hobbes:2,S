I got that error on 2.4.30-rc1 a couple of times, and now cannot
reproduce it :-(
But if you got it too, then it wasn't just bad luck.
The ext3 code in 2.4.30-rc does have a few more checks for IO errors
which will cause the journal to be aborted and produce this error, so
I suspect that change which caused the problem is a change in ext3.
However that doesn't mean the bug is there.
The extra code in ext3 seems to just check if buffer_uptodate is false
after it has waited on a locked buffer, and triggers a journal abort
if it isn't.  This should be perfectly safe, and I cannot find any
logic error near by.  But nor can I find any errors that would cause a
buffer returned from raid1 to not be uptodate (unless there really was
an IO error).
