The answer to this is pretty much the same as why the -mm tree isn't in
git either.
The RT tree is made up of lots of patches (over 300). Our goal is to get
RT into mainline Linux. RT isn't just one type of system, it extends all
over the kernel, and the patches may be rewriten over and over. Managing
this in quilt is a lot easier than managing it in git.
That said, there's been talk about making a git tree for others based on
the quilt queue. The thing is that a new git tree will need to be created
for every release. Which means that it will be difficult for others to
simply update their local repo since you will get a bunch of errors with
not being from the same head.

Which arch? We are already on PowerPC, ARM and MIPS. Thinking about sh?
The best would be to read the code and look at my paper:
http://ols.108.redhat.com/2007/Reprints/rostedt-Reprint.pdf
(Internals of the RT Patch)
This will give you an idea of what is needed to port to another arch.

No, in fact, I think it's about time to add these to our FAQ:
