That's just putrid. You've proposed an interface that
combines the worst of ASCII with the worst of binary.
It is now well-established that ASCII interfaces are
horribly slow. This one will be no exception... but
with the '\0' in there, you have a binary interface.
So, it's an evil hybrid.
An ioctl() is a syscall with scope restricting it to a
single fd. This is a fine user interface, not a bogus one.
(keep 32-on-64 operation in mind to be polite)
If you'd rather have a normal (global) system call though,
that'll do too, likely leading to a bit more type checking
in the glibc-provided headers.
Adding plain old syscalls is rather nice actually.
It's only a pain at first, while waiting for glibc
to catch up.
