I wouldn't mind having a new doc infrastructure, but I don't see this as it.

I think that we don't want to give up html/pdf/ps output formats in
favor of just text or C source code.  If we do continue to have
multiple "rich" output formats, we need even more rich syntax rules
than we have right now.  OTOH, if we dump all of those rich output
formats, we have less tool spice that is needed.
(I'm not ignoring Andrew's question here.  I'm just applying the
7 patches/series and looking at it more.)

Yes, but I dunno what either.

It's great that Rusty took the time to produce all of this documentation.
Few people do that today.
Were current kernel-doc tools not sufficient?  If not, why not?
