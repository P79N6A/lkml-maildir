The SMI is an unbearable abomination and it is an issue that even Microsoft
has been unable to make Intel respond to properly. It makes Rambus seem brilliant.
The basic idea: take a high speed well optimized processor that is the most
critical performance component of your system and arbitrarily divert it to managing
fans completely outside of OS control is so unbearably stupid, arrogant, ugly and 
nauseating as to be hard to believe even in this industry.
