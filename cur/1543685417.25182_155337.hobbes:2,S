That answers the question that poped up in my mind.
"How does the tool know where the blocks are, and in which order it can
'move' then without corrupting the data.(*)
Seems it doesn't know it.
But it is possibel(*2) to do what the programm wants to do, you only
have to find out the order in which you have to copy the blocks to
prevent garbage. That's all the magic.
*: I mean the point where it copies the data from the sparse-file to the
block-device.
*2: All you (theoretically) need is 1 free block, or you go over
temp-space(e.g. memory) somewhere else.

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as

wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
