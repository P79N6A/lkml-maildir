Just send me the url&branch-name for a tree which you want included in -mm.
I typically pull all the trees once per day.  I usually won't even look at
the contents of what I pulled from you unless it breaks.
IOW, -mm is like a tree to which 70-odd people have commit permissions,
except it's 70 separate trees and I independently jam them all into one
tree daily.

yup.

git will sort that out.

I'll leave that question to a gittier responder.  But yes, you'll get
shouted at if Linus's final commit contains irrelevant commit and merge
stuff.
