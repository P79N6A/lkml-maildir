That sounds like a typical bug during driver development... you're
probably wedging the hardware by doing the wrong access.
I didn't see the source for saa716x_read or write in the code you
posted, so it's hard to say if there's a problem with them.
Is your interrupt handler getting called?  Is the device generating
interrupts?

Just pci_enable_msi() as usual.
