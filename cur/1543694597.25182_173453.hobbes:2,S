Simple example:
dd if=/dev/urandom of=foo count=1 bs=31k
for i in `seq 10`; do cat foo >> bar; done
cp bar foo
time gzip foo
time bzip2 bar
ls -l foo.gz bar.bz2
Notice how bzip2 runs ~80 times longer and output remains ~60% bigger.
And now try this:
time bzip2 foo.gz
ls -l foo.gz.bz2 bar.bz2
How wonderful, bzip2 runs fast again and the result is even smaller.
:)
While this example is constructed, it demonstrates nicely where bzip2
sucks.  It also demonstrates how simply bzip2 could be improved.
Anyone up for a fun hack?
