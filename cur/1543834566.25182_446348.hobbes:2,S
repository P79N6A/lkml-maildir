The advantage with walking the task list is new entries are always added
at the end.  Neither of the other two proposed orders does that.  So
in fact I think the problem will get worse leaving more tasks skipped,
because in those cases new tasks can be inserted before our cursor in
the list.  The proposed snapshot implementation has a similar problem
in that new process could get skipped.
The simplest version I can think of is to place a cousin of the
tasklist into struct pid.  Allowing us to use a very similar
algorithm to what we use now.  But since we can pin struct pid we
won't have the chance of our current position being deleted.
