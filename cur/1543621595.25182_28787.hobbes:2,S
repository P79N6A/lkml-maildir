Hi, how can I call some kind of APIs from kernel mode,
such as open, ioctl and close? Because I need to use
some services of another kernel module from my kernel
module and I have no source code of the module which
provides the services. Now I can only access the
module in user space using the open, ioctl and close
APIs. Can I do the same thing in my kernel module?
Thanks.
Michael
