I don't know about a formal standard, either.
Nevertheless, in my initial post, I wasn't talking about rmdir (2), I was
talking about rmdir(1)'s behaviour on linux-2.[12].x breaking gcc/fixincludes
for building cross-compilers.
The cause of this problem is the fragment from gcc/fixincludes below:
> echo 'Removing unneeded directories:'

This fragment relies on rmdir(1) failing when $file contains "."- So the actual
problem is gcc/fixincludes requiring "rmdir $LIB/." to fail (Of cause this can
easily be worked around by modifying fixincludes, but is a different topic).
AFAIS, this fragment is present in all gcc-releases I have handy right now:
gcc-1.42 (Sep. 91), gcc-2.3.1 (Oct. 92), gcc-2.7.2.3, egcs-1.1b, egcs-1.1.1 and
egcs updated from cvs a few hours ago.
IMO, this is indicates that this fragment must have worked on all (most?) hosts
which have been supported by gcc (BTW, it did on linux-2.0.x) and which have
been used as hosts for cross-compilation.
Given this assumption is true and considering that fixincludes doesn't work
anymore for cross-compiling on linux-2.[12].x, because of rmdir(1)'s
behavioural difference, this might also indicate that all (most?) platforms but
linux-2.[12].X issue an error/warning on "rmdir ." (de-facto standard?).
