Since we're now discussing how to effectively port the kernel to C++, 
I'd suggest getting g++ to accept these structure initializers, and move 
them incrementally to standard C++ code.
Should be similar to the conversion to C99 initializers.

It looks like you don't value your time much. You're comparing human 
time (yours!) to machine time.
If we accept your 1.4 C++ vs C factor, then these 200,000 people would 
be compiling 2.6.24 instead of 2.6.16.12.
(Of course, not all code benefits equally from C++. I'd guess the VM 
internals wouldn't benefit as much, filesystems and drivers benefiting a 
lot).
C++ compilation isn't slower because the compiler has to recognize more 
keywords. It's slower because it is doing more for you: checking types 
(C++ code is usually free of void *'s except for raw data) and expanding 
those 4-line function to their 14-line goto-heavy equivalents.

C++ works excellently for things like list_head. The generated code is 
as efficient or better that the C equivalent, and the API is *much* 
cleaner. You can iterate over a list without knowing the name of the 
field which contains your list_head (and possibly getting it wrong if 
there is more than one).

Why would it be rejected?
A static constructor is just like a module init function. Why are 
modules not rejected out of hand?
