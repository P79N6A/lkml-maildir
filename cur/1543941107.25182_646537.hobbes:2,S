Hi Boris,
Thank you for the confirmation of original behavior.

end_that_request_last() is not called when __blk_end_reuqest()
returns 1.  Then, the issuer isn't waken up.
So I think the BUG() or error messages should be there.
And fortunately, the issuer seems not to mind whether
end_that_request_first() is called for the remaining bio or not.
So I think Jens' patch is fine.
Thanks,
