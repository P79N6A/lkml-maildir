The ones I use (after I broke every build from here to Kingdom Come with
my dreaded cpumask patch ;) are I believe the same ones Andrew recommends:
  Cross-Compile Tool Chains used in Patch LifeCycle Manager
  
http://developer.osdl.org/dev/plm/cross_compile/
They work pretty slick - download, unpack, set the specified ENV
variables, and build away.  I build several arch's on my desktop PC.
I did report a breakage in the alpha build a couple of weeks ago to an
email I found embedded in the tools, and haven't heard anything back. 
Don't know if that's been addressed or not.  I should send that message
out again.
