Yeah, I don't like it much either.  native.h doesn't say what the
alternative is.  native_paravirt.h is kind of contradictory.

In the paravirt case, they all come into one ops structure, which has to
be declared in one place.
Of course, those headers can do:
#ifdef CONFIG_PARAVIRT
#include <asm/paravirt.h>
#else
...
#endif
I'll try this and see what happens.  Playing with the x86 headers can be
extremely hairy 8(

I'm just shuffling code here, and if the other approach works, I won't
even be doing that.
But I'm happy to submit a separate patch which cleans these...
Thanks!
Rusty.
