Jan, I think the problem is about long UDF structures names.
The only purpose for this patch is to set up braces and spaces
properly. I'll make lines shorter as soon as _this_ patch become
veryfied and included in main kernel. Moreover I also should
get rid of macroses and other stuff. Lets do work by small steps ;)
But you are absolutely right!

Thanks for note. I've it just missed.

This became from my local git branch. Thanks. Will be removed.

Jan I've messed up with this patch and my prev patches that already
in -mm tree. Actually udf_alloc_i_data was introduced by my prev patch.
I'll fix this mess.
