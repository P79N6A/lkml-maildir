The counter's placement was poor in that version of the patch. The
results are very suspect and likely invalid. It would have been more
helpful if you provided some kind of unique identifier when requests
for complete disambiguation are made. For instance, the version tags of
your patches are not visible in Subject: lines.
There are, of course, other issues, e.g. where the arch sweeps went.
This discussion has degenerated into non-cooperation making it beyond
my power to help, and I'm in the midst of several rather urgent
bughunts, of which there are apparently more to come.
