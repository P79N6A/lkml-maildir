{su}{8,16,32,64} doesnt matter too much to me vs {u,}int_t{8,16,32,64}_t.  as 
long as people stop using __{su}{8,16,32,64}.  using the latter though does 
mean headers will more likely be "just usable" w/out needing linux/types.h 
include.  but then people would be forced to include stdint.h or similar 
before a linux header ... and that sucks.
unless of course we start adding appropriate C library includes for 
!__KERNEL__ ... i'd love that personally

i dont get your bool comment.  the "bool" type is already a standard type.  
there is no conversion needed.
