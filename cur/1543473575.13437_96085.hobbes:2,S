I've been using that version with 2.1.xx for quite a while -- 0.83K
flat-out doesn't work with the Lite-On chip in my LinkSys card. Apart
from a few annoying bugs (10/100 auto-sense is very broken, and there
are some nasty ARP bugs), it's working fine. It certainly hasn't ever
rebooted my system, and it's a lot better than not having a working
ether card at all.
My vote's for including 0.89H in 2.2.0.
