Looks quite ok to me...

Is it really neccessery to have ifdef here?

And here? ... It would be nice to use slightly shorter identifier.
'KJUMP_IS_KEXECED' should be enough.

Hmm, is this enough? Should it use struct ptregs for normal registers?
What about segment registers -- they could change between kernel
version. Should some kind of 'version of kjump protocol' be
introduced?
What about CX/DX/fpu state? GDT pointer?
Actually I think that you _do_ need to save FPU. You should probably
use relevant swsusp parts here.
