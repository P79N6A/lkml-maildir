Hi,
I'm writting a char driver for a home made ISA I/O board. I noticed the
driver's release function which is called by kernel after /dev/myboard is
closed is receiving an invalid minor number value.
Should I assume the minor number information is not valid when that function is
called or is it a bug?
Best regards,
