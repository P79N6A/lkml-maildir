You might want to check and see what is actually being
used for the solid-state disk. Some solid state disks
are SRAM and DRAM. SRAM is fast, it doesn't require refresh,
is now as cheap as flash, and does R/W forever. It retains
its data for 10 years of power being removed by using an
embedded battery.

This is exactly what I proposed on this list a long
time ago. It is now a reality.
