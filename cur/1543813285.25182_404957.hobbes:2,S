DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is great for finding the really stupid kinds of bugs, and 
it's definitely worth doing every once in a while.
However, DEBUG_PAGEALLOC makes many things orders of magnitude slower, and 
it eats memory like mad (because it turns some slabs into whole pages - 
but it still doesn't help small allocation debugging that much). So unlike 
DEBUG_SLAB, it's not reasonable to have it on all the time.
IOW, DEBUG_SLAB is something that a distro kernel can reasonably enable 
for users by default (I think fedora-devel does, for example). In 
contrast, DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is more of a "useful for special cases" thing, 
where you want to validate that there's nothing _obviously_ bad going on.

I suspect that once DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is on, whether you do DEBUG_SLAB or 
not is a toss-up. The interesting cases tend to be
 - neither: usable for benchmarking
 - DEBUG_SLAB: perfectly usable for normal work
 - DEBUG_PAGEALLOC (with or without DEBUG_SLAB): debugging tool only
At least that's my opinion, maybe others have other experiences.
