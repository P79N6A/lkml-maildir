One hint is that this bug is triggered when you attempt to add a request
in from of one that has already been started. In case of ide,
ide_do_drive_cmd with ide_preempt would trigger this. That may or may
not be a bug, depends on if the driver knows what it is doing or not.
If the driver knows what it is doing, then this patch should cure your
problem.
