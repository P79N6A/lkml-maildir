OK, I missed that information in your last mail then, I thought
you had done successful NFS tests and then failed on a local cp.
Looks like we need to focus on more XFS/NFS testing in 2.6; will
do.

Understood -- its good to have it narrowed down to XFS.  Was that
ext3 test on the same DM device, also at 5.5 Tb with LBD, and NFS
involved too?  Could you send me your xfs_repair output and also
your filesystem geometry (xfs_info).
thanks.
