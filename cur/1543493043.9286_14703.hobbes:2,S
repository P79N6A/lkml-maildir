yep this should work. (i optimized this because the above takes about 300
cycles to do, but it's an incorrect approach) But i doubt this is the
cause of the numeric instability observed, nothing i know of relies on the
tag/status word exported through the ptrace interface. [but i agree that
we should be rather correct than fast]
