Those were problems with the usb_id program, not problems in the 
kernel.  How up-to-date is your udev installation?

Nothing wrong with that.  You should expect that removing a device 
while it is use would produce a few error messages.

There's no indication in the log that the disk problem was at all
related to the sound card.  Nor is there any indication that all your
USB buses were affected; only the disk drive got messed up.  The card
reader, the hub, the keyboard, and the mouse all seem to have survived.

Sure it does.

The events in your logs are not oopses.  The program segfaults, which
means that the crash occurs in userspace, not while the program is
running in the kernel.
