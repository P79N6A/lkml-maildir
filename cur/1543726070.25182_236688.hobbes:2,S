The Caps Lock problem goes away with voluntary-preempt=2.  It makes
sense that 3 would be problematic, as for audio work you don't want the
soundcard interrupt redirected.
The obvious next feature to add would be to make certain IRQs
non-schedulable, like you would for an RT system.  For an audio system
this would be just the soundcard interrupt (and timer as stated above). 
Then, while it still might not be hard-RT, it would blow away anything
achievable on the other OS'es people do audio work with.
