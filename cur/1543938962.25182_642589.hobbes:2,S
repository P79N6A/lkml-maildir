Historical note: old kvm versions (like the what will eventually ship in 
2.6.24) have a page-based rmap (hooking the rmap list off 
page->private).  We changed that to an mm based rmap since page->private 
is not available when kvm maps general userspace memory.

You also need the mm (or rather, the kvm structure, but they have a 1:1 
relationship) to be able to lock and maintain the shadow structures 
properly.
