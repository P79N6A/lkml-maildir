  Right, that would make things much cleaner. Will try for it.

  It's the way it is in posix-timers and I'm not sure I understand why. We take
a ref on the specific task if notify is SIGEV_THREAD_ID but not for
SIGEV_SIGNAL.
  I'm wondering what I'm missing here, shouldn't we also take a ref on the task
group leader in the SIGEV_SIGNAL case in posix-timers?

  I missing something too here ;-)
  If someone cared to explain why there is no ref taken on the task for the
SIGEV_SIGNAL case, it would be much appreciated. Is this a bug in posix-timers?
  Thanks,
  Sébastien.
