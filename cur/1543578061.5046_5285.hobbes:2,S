   Yuck.  A new file_opo just to get a few benchmarks right ...  I
   hope the writepages stuff will not be merged in Linus tree (but I
   wish the code behind it!)
It's a "I know how to send a page somewhere via this filedescriptor
all by myself" operation.  I don't see why people need to take
painkillers over this for 2.4.x.  I think f_op->write is stupid, such
a special case file operation just to get a few benchmarks right.
This is the kind of argument I am hearing.
Orthogonal to f_op->write being for specifying a low-level
implementation of sys_write, f_op->writepage is for specifying a
low-level implementation of sys_sendfile.  Can you grok that?
Linus has already seen this.  Originally he had a gripe because in an
older revision of the code used to allow multiple pages to be passed
in an array to the writepage(s) operation.  He didn't like that, so I
made it take only one page as he requested.  He had no other major
objections to the infrastructure.
