If you have to hide the operation so deeply like this, maybe you can
do something similar to sparc64, by explicitly doing the per-cpu fixed
register and offsets, and still get the single instruction relocs that
powerpc can do for up to 64K by doing something like:
	&per_cpu_blah - &per_cpu_base
to calculate the offset.
