Why don't you use ioread8() instead of defining atmel_getb()?
You'd still need something PPC64-specific to initialize the iomem cookie,
but the accessors would go away.
Unfortunately, ioread8() and associated interfaces aren't mentioned
under Documentation/, but there are some hints in lib/iomap.c.
