I am running 2.5.52bk5 with you GNU patch. Doesn't help.
I do a modprobe i810 and I get:
FATAL: Error inserting i810 
(/lib/modules/2.5.52bk5/kernel/drivers/char/drm/i810.ko): Cannot allocate 
memory
This is from dmesg:
[drm:drm_init] *ERROR* Cannot initialize the agpgart module.
Uninitialised timer!
This is just a warning.  Your computer is OK
