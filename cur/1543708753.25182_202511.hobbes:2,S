What do you actually want to do them?  Linux doesn't do the traditional
unix spl scheme for coplexity and performance reasons, see
www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/ana97/full_papers/small/small.ps
for a related paper.  Give that linux hardirq handlers should be very small
there's no performance gain in that area for sane architectures, too.
