Checking in gfp.h, I see:
#define __GFP_DMA       0x01
#define __GFP_HIGHMEM   0x02
#define __GFP_WAIT      0x10    /* Can wait and reschedule? */
#define __GFP_HIGH      0x20    /* Should access emergency pools? */
#define __GFP_IO        0x40    /* Can start physical IO? */
#define __GFP_FS        0x80    /* Can call down to low-level FS? */
#define GFP_KERNEL      (__GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_FS)
Thus, it looks like it's not a dma allocation.  By my reading, it 
appears to be a standard GFP_KERNEL.
