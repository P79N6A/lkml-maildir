Oh, don't look too closely at some pseudo-code, it's not like the code
would actually do that for a minor number. But for things like major
number allocation for disk devices, it might not be too far off. And we 
migth even want to start off the minors at some "random" offset (obviously 
while keeping the alignment right for the partition handling)
