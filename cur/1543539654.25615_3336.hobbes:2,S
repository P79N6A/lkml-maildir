This patch affects only some ioctls (there are some other fixes as weel,
bit "shield" part of it is exactly that).

It's other way around: it's patch to allow ONLY know-to-be-good commands
(like DISABLE_SEAGATE or EXABYTE_ENABLE_NEST) so equivalent command for WD
will be rejected while DISABLE_SEAGATE can be sent even to IBM HDD.

Not exactly. As Linus said it's a LOT of band-aids to avoid the "obvious"
holes. You know where to find such stuff.
