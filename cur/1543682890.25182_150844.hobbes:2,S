No. It may be handled entirely in an interrupt service routine, but
never by the hardware alone, even the "smart" hardware that does
IP checksumming. There isn't enough information available. The
echo request contains the IP that the caller seeks to respond.
The responder needs to know, not only its IP address, but also the
IP address of all the IPs it's going to ARP (proxy ARP).
