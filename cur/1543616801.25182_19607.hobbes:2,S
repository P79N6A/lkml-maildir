Point well made. How about
#define PRIO_TO_TIMESLICE(p) \
  (MAX_TIMESLICE -
((USER_PRIO(p)*(MAX_TIMESLICE-MIN_TIMESLICE))/(MAX_USER_PRIO-1)))
#define RT_PRIO_TO_TIMESLICE(p) \
  (MAX_TIMESLICE - ((p*(MAX_TIMESLICE-MIN_TIMESLICE))/(MAX_RT_PRIO-1)))
If people agree with this, I'll submit a new diff (with the right options).
