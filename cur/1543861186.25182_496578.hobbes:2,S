Sure, no problem.
Checking it into my tree with /proc/acpi/sony is
no different than what is in -mm today.
When we push upstream, however, the /proc/acpi/sony part should be gone,
or at least scheduled for removal.
I suggest a sub CONFIG option under CONFIG_SONY_ACPI, say,
CONFIG_SONY_ACPI_PROCFS so you can #ifdef the code that
is going away.
thanks for stepping forward Mattia,
