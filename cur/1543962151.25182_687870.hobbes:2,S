So well. I'm still unsure about the advantage of having some opencoded
probe loop in the driver, instead of implementing it in a common place
and doing all of it with a single API call.
We can still call dma_get_required_mask() and adjust the mask to that
in dma_set_mask_weak(). That can _additionally_ be done there.
