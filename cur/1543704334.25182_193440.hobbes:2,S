On ARM at least, gcc 3.2.x seems buggy.  It's along the lines of this:
 3.2.0: incorrect function argument offset calculation.
 3.2.x: miscompiles NEW_AUX_ENT in fs/binfmt_elf.c
        (
http://gcc.gnu.org/PR8896
) and incorrect structure
        initialisation in fs/jffs2/erase.c
I suspect that the fs/jffs2/erase.c problem is not ARM-specific, though
I'm no compiler expert.
However, gcc 3.3 seems table on ARM, and I'm not aware of any problems
with any further 3.3.x releases.
