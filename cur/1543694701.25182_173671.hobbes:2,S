Ok, this is good to know. Have you ever tried 2.4 based kernels with
that motherboard ? Also, have you ever tried running multiple
drives with that controller ? Somehow I still have this feeling
that with only one disk connected to a HPT374-controller it might
work without problems, while with multiple disks it becomes
unstable (this is the case with a a friends Epox 4PCA3+
based machine in addition to my two machines).
Can you perhaps send me off-the-list your .config and output of
/proc/interrupts so that I could compare those to mine ?
