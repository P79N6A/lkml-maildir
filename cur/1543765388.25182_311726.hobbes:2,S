I have seen exactly the same on my fathers computer and could solve this
by not starting the udftools. Didn't have the time to digg further into
this... 
Can you confirm thats really a udf problem? Just run
"/etc/init.d/udftools stop" or the similar for your distribution and try
mounting again.
Cheers,
