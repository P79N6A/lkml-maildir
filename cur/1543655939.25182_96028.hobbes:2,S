	This is a constant battle for programmers trying to develop sophisticated 
applications for sophisticated operating systems.
	If all of the applications are cooperating, you can do it fairly easily. 
First, ask the kernel how much physical memory there is. Then fudge a 
reduction based on kernel usage. Then subtract the amount of RAM each 
application is 'really using' by asking it.
	If you write all the applications, this isn't hard to do. If you have to 
cooperate with other applications you didn't write, things get trickier. If 
you're the only application, things are really easy.
	There are any number of heuristics and guesstimates. Ultimately, I recommend 
mostly leaving your memory usage user-configurable.
	DS
