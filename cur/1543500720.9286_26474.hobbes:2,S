so far I have had only one freeze by X that required hitting the reset ....
Ctrl-Alt-Backspace kills X and dumps me back to the console, and then I can
re-start X...
so far I have only heard from a few people (2?) that have SMP 2.2.x / XFree
3.3.3.1 on there system, and are having this problem. No UP systems yet ..
the UP systems I have heard from are not running X3.3.3.1 (the UP systems
seem to have X3.3.2.x)...
XFree recommeds that if you are running a version that isolder than 6-12
months upgrade.. X3.3.3.1 is almost that I believe... please upgrade to
3.3.3.1 it if you have problems (freezing) then after you have upgraded if
you are still having problems then let me know.. thank you...
There are various distros that these people are using also. debian 2.1
supposedly comes with 3.3.2.3 (so I have been told?)

maybe he (Linus) should start using egcs at least testing with it then, as it
is "going" to be gcc 2.9 soon, and most distros are going that way.
</suggestion>
Currently I think that most glibc2.1 distros include (?)egcs(?),  and no
longer include gcc. Someone that is not comiling there kernel very often
should not have a special C compiler on a system just for the kernel. Besides
how often does one compile a kernel that is not developing? (last compile
I did was when 2.2.10 came out)
If egcs is causing kernel 2.2 compile problems than this is a another issue
as more and more distros come with it "exclusively" .  More and more will
experience problems.
I have noticed thou that occasionally a process gets scheduled (read on SMP)
and run and then shoots the CPU usage to 100% (am logging now if it occurs
again I will know which CPU) for that process and stays there until it is
killed.  Other have reported this with bdflush, but I have had this happen
with kflushd (yesterday) and bdflush (rare maybe 1 time), as well as Netscape
(yes Netscape), and possiblly other programs (cannot recall).
If this happens with Xwrapper could it be what is causing X to freeze? I am
also using a hardware cursor, if XFreezes and I have a hardware cursor will
the hardware cursor continue to operate even though the software is not
working properly?

I don't have gcc 2.7.2.anything on my system ie RH 6.0 in fact it is egcs
1.1.2 not 1.0
I just upgraded to the new X 3.3.3.1 rpms at RH's site. these are updates but
I am not sure what they fix..
