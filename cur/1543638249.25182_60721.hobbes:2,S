Sure, if you just want to run DOS and DOS programs you could do
better than using emm386. But if you are actually tring to
emulate a PC, it should have been able to load emm386 without
emm386 even noticing the difference. I guess this just proves
that vm86 isn't well suited for a complete emulation.
IMHO nowadays a reasonable requirement for a good architecture
is that it can easily emulate itself. I guess from that point of
view x86 is not a good architecture, but that shouldn't stop us
from trying to get as close as possible.
