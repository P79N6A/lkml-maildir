Maybe. I use an old Cross LFS build, as well as Debian (does Debian 
officially support m68k?), and there also exists an unofficial Gentoo 
port.

Nothing, except that uniformity across platforms follows the principal of 
least suprise. That generally makes life easier downstream.
I personally have created and used m68k cross toolchains as "m68k-linux", 
"m68k-linux-gnu" and "m68k-unknown-linux-gnu". AFAIK it's quite arbitrary.
This wasn't an issue before we came to depend on cross compilers. Since we 
tend to need them more as compilation becomes more expensive, IMHO we 
should follow the practice of the embedded architectures.
