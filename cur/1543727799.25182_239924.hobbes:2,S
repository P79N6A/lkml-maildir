That's the question.  From talking to gcc developers in the former Cygnus 
office, it's thought that alignment-restricted architectures are supposed to 
do bytewise access (or equivalent) to PACKED fields, but nobody was sure if 
every architecture implements this, or even if it's the formally defined 
behavior for PACKED.  That's a subset of GCC developers of course.
As far as I can see, if PACKED doesn't work this way on all architectures then 
it's broken and needs to be fixed.
