That was with the patch.  He gave me a copy of the full source tree.. read
the last thread, udma not working....  
Still can't see why it's not working, but i'm not exactly a kernel hacker,
but i'm not that dumb either to start a second thread after i got replies
and followed the instructions in the first thread.  Also try reading th
eoutput i sent, if you noticed it had th epatch in the listing, but people
are just lasy i guess.. ah well.
