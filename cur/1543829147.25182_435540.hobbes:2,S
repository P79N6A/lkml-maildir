 Hi,
 We're using a 2.6.X kernel,
  and are experiencing intermittent dropped connections when the number 
of concurrent connections exceeds ~ 1000.
  Does anybody have any insight into what might be happening here and/or 
troubleshooting techniques
 for isolating the problem.
 What system resources is TCP dependent on?
 Many thanks,
 Dave
