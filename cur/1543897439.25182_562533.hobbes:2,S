I would suggest changing it. It makes it more obvious to the casual that
there are no other callers of the 'internal' functions. It's a matter of
taste though; if you feel _very_ strongly about it then feel free to
ignore me.

Yes, that looks right. As a matter of course you should also run 'make
headers_check' before submitting your new patch, to make sure everything
is sane. That'll tell you if your exported pps.h is trying to include
other header files which aren't also exported.
