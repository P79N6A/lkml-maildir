... [Lots more of these]
This is odd. I have only ever seen this error when my sound
card or module parameters are misconfigured. However, since
this occured after using the sound card all day long, I'm
not quite sure what to make of it. I was in the middle of
playing a game (under Wine) when sound stopped working.
Reloaded the sound modules. Now /dev/audio plays silently.
There are no messages in the syslog. The Tropez+'s Wavefront
synth still plays and the mixer still works however, so the
soundcard isn't completely dead.
