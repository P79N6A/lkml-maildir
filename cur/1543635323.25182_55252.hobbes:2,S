I generally prefer to use EIDE for hard disks, and SCSI for other peripherals, (and disks which are for, e.g. databases, but certainly not for boot disks, or general usage disks).
I tend to find 'silly' problems occuring with ATAPI devices, such as a motherboard/ATAPI CD-ROM drive combination that would never boot from the CD, because the BIOS reset the bus just before booting, and the CD-ROM would respond 'not ready'.  Generally SCSI peripherals tend to have a bit more thought put in to their design.
John.
