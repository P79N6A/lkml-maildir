That's fine.  Despite not having an open source hypervisor, we really 
don't have evil intentions, and we really don't want to create tension 
or impede the progress of anyone else.  We think this work has positive 
benefits for Linux, our hypervisor, and others as well.
Some of our code did very much need fixing, and the positive thing we 
can take away from such a heated discussion is that we probably got more 
eyes on our code, maybe trying to find the evil, and instead finding 
bugs or things we could have done better.
At least someone did need to play devil's advocate, as this is an 
important thing to get right for the future direction of Linux, and I 
respect you for doing so, and don't take offense.
