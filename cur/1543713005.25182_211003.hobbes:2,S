Hi,
Because I subscribed to linux-kernel recently, so I didn't get the patch after the cmpci.c posted (A user posted it). The driver after 6.0 has added kernel patch so I posted patches based on my CVS from them.
To me it is easier to keep one version for kernel 2.4 and 2.6, with a few patches, that keeps driver functions consistent.
I can post changes since my 5.64 (current version for kernel 2.6) and to 6.16 (kernel version for kernel 2.4) and the diff file of 5.64 of mine and the kernel.
Sincerely,
ChenLi Tien

To what kernel do these patches apply?  Certainly not current 2.6.
If you intend to raise 2.6 patches, please ensure that they are against the
latest kernel.org kernel.  And please ensure that the patches are in `patch
-p1' form.  The headers should look like:
--- a/sound/oss/cmpci.c 22 Mar 2004 17:07:02 -0000      6.64
+++ a/sound/oss/cmpci.c 29 Mar 2004 22:58:49 -0000      6.65
Also, a single patch per email is preferred.
Thanks.
