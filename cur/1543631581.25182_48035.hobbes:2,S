Hello,
My kernel (2.4.17 with Usagi/Preempt/lm-sensors patches) has hang with
these kind of messages (from /var/log/messages):
kernel: recvmsg bug: copied 99564C37 seq 9956A67C
...
kernel: recvmsg bug: copied 99564C37 seq 0
I waited some minutes but had to reboot with the button because nothing
was responding.
I have reguraly the same (I suppose) hangs: I hear an access on a disk
(the one with /var/log) and it hangs. I suppose I've been lucky this
time since I have something in logs.
I've (allmost) never had anything in logs except this afternoon.
The last time I had something was on January 16th (same kernel, without
Usagi).
Here is the full log:
http://crazy.fred.free.fr/tmp/bug.txt
The log looks awful, it seems syslogs had some trouble..
It seems there is another message but maybe not very useful since it is
allmost unreadable.
I use:
- Linux 2.4.17 SMP on Abit BP6 (dual celeron) with 384MB RAM
- Usagi patch
- preempt patch
- lm-sensors patch
- gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release)
- binutils 2.11.2
- glibc 2.2.4
PS: please CC since I'm not on the list.
