*Only* if the perceived need comes from performance issues.
Threads are a rather nice programming abstraction *if used right*, and  
processes (i.e. threads without shared memory) certainly aren't a  
reasonable replacement, just as you wouldn't want to replace subroutines  
with processes.
In *this* role, performance is a rather secondary issue (unless it's  
abysmally bad).
Coroutines can do a lot of this, but as soon as you have hard-to-predict  
scheduling, or want to block on system calls, you want real threads, not  
coroutines.
