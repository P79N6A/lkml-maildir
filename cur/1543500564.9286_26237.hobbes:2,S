I have heard that several people are having X crashing /
freezing problems, and the only similarities so far seem to be
SMP (I have not heard about any UP's having problems yet) and
XFree86. There seems to be different window managers, different
apps running, different configurations, and different
distributions, and different kernels. The only similarities so
far seem to be X.
I am assuming that everyone who has had X crash is running XFree
3.3.3.1 (is this correct)
My guess is that something is probably wrong in X itself or in
the kernel i/o that is afecting X but am guessing at this point?
I have in the past (with 2.0 kernels) had io failed requests and
X crashes, but that stopped with 2.2. 
In 2.2 my mouse sometimes stops working correctly. IE, it moves
but the mouse clicks do not do anything, or it moves but not in
the direction that I want it to (suddenly it can only go up and
down or something?), or the mouse and keyboard do not have any
effect on X. (except control-alt-backspace and that does not
always work)
So now I have a few questions:
     1) is anyone who is running a uniprocessor machine having
problems with X 3.3.3.1 and the 2.2 kernels that is causeing
them to either reboot or force an X shutdown as described above?
( ie is this an SMP problem exclusively or is it occuring on UP
machines as well)
     2) if anyone has experienced this have they found a fix?
     3) how does one tell if this is kernel related or X
related?
     4) with 2.2.x what compilers can be safely recommended ? I
remember that in 2.0 there were problems with gcc 2.8.1 that
XFree86.org recommended not using that one as it caused io
problems, could egcs be having a similar effect? (ie is anyone
who is NOT using egcs with 2.2 having this problem?)
my machine is:
DUAL P-233MMX
128 Meg RAM
Diamond Stealth 3D 2000 4Meg video card (PCI)
Linux Kernel 2.2.10
XFree86 3.3.3.1
egcs 1.0.x
glibc2.1
RH6.0 
    until today I thought that I was the only one having this
problem but it seem that there are more of you out there.
thanks .. Joe
