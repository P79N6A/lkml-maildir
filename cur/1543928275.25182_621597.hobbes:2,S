That would be hard to believe. Linux cannot shut down CPUs
completely (put them back to SINIT state) because there is no generic
interface for this and it might be impossible. They just get put 
into a HLT loop.
And even if they were in SINIT they would still need the HT connections
otherwise it would be impossible to ever wake them up.
The way HT setup is normally done is that the BIOS sets it all up
and then it never changes (except for some error conditions that 
may cause SYNC flood)

While that may help I doubt your analysis of the source of the problem
is correct. Most likely something is broken with the IO-APIC, but not
related to HyperTransport.
It would be better to properly root cause before applying.
