AFAICS one of the first sysctl concepts is to be redundancy tolerant.
If you take fs for instance, it's being declared here and there.
It means "if it doens't exist yet, we create it with mode (555) else
 go cycle to the sub-branch (fs-nfs....) btw, we have a register(fs) so
no problem for me.Lockd has to do with nfs so it should be preserved at
the same place IMHO.

I used both ntfs, coda fs scheme having in mind independant sysctl
registering in forthcoming releases.
But hey ! "I'm an absolute beginner" :) Maybe you and Andrew can tell me
what to do with this ugly patch ;) e.g. no sysctl.h -> include stuff in
inode.c ...
