Moderation always gets tricky once you get past the non obvious spam 
phase. However if Dave isnt keen to follow this path, there is certainly scope
for people to do a 'best of linux-kernel' list. I imagine a lot of the
less full time developers would benefit from that.
Interesting project, hard work and probably not terribly rewarding
