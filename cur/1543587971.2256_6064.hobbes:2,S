Well it's not actually possible to do a fix in userspace for a odometer type of counter that can be reset. I don't know what you mean about policy but this reset "feature" is a shure way to get bad values. I have not seen one good reason to have a reset other than it easier to read and that is something that can be fixed in userspace.
