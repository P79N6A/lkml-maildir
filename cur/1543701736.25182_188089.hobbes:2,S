I would not call it 'lag' if an ls of /usr/bin takes 20 secs vs 1 sec
before... I mean the scroll speed limits e.g. the compile speed...
Well I now tried xterm, gnome-terminal (gtk2), multi-gnome-terminal
(gtk1), xvt, aterm, wterm, Eterm, and yes they are all (except for
Eterm) plain text on solid background - so no eye candy. Interestingly
Eterm, wterm and aterm seem to not be affected by that issue.
