These patches were written by Maneesh Soni. Since the Read-Copy Update
infrastructure has not been accepted into the mainline kernel yet (although
there were murmurings of it being acceptable) you will need to apply
those first. Here they are, apply in this order. Too big to post
inline text though. These are provided against 2.5.36-mm1.

There has been quite a bit of testing done on this and it has proven
quite stable. If anyone wants to do any additional testing that would
be great.
Thanks.
