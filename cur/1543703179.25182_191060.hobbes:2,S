this sounds like a broken disk or a bad cable. please try to delete the 
span array on the hpt370 controller and then recreate the volume by 
selecting the disks in reversed order. so that the second disk comes 
first. if it there are still errors at about the 32 file then send me 
the geometry data and the first 16 sectors of your disks.
