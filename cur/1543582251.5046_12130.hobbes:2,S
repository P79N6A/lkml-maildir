Thanks for this information. I patched my the kernel with it.
After rebooting with the new kernel i can see the bitmask
for every process running on my server.
#cat /proc/1310/cpus_allowed
ffffffff
Now, if i want to run this process on only one cpu, i which way
do i have to set the bitmask ?
Let's say, i want to run it on cpu0. how look's the bitmask ?
Thanks 
Regards
Thomas
