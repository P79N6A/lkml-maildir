What machine this was on? Kernel config won't allow you to unselect that
option if AT Keyboard is selected, and that's always selected when
CONFIG_PC is.

I tested it then, and now again. And I can't get the prompt you're
getting.
	$ bk clone linus test
	$ cd test
	$ bk -r get
	$ make defconfig
	$ bk pull ../input
	$ make oldconfig
doesn't ask ANY questions.
I can imagine that option being asked about on a Mac, but there it might
make sense, or at least cause no harm if you enable it, even if it's
not needed.

The changes to the keyboard/mouse controller code (i8042.c) are added
powermanagement callbacks, which are very much needed, and added ACPI
probing, which, although not strictly needed, is a less intrusive way of
detecting whether a kbd/mouse controller is present.
Regarding libps2, that doesn't touch the controller code itself, only
the mouse and keyboard drivers. It's a refactoring of the code,
eliminating a bunch of duplicate code which had a tendency of diverging
and that was causing problems. It shouldn't change any functionality per
se.
> Does the work actually _fix_ anything,
The refactoring itself didn't fix any problems, and it wasn't intended
to, but it uncovered some bugs that when fixed, made real problems go
away, like the ACK timeouts in RESET_BAT code path.

Does a few months in Andrew's tree count?
