[ Upstream commit 6d329af9967e7ab3f4a3d7f1e8ef87539c3a069f ]
Commit 147e70e6 ("cxgb3: Use SKB list interfaces instead of home-grown
implementation.") causes a crash in t3_l2t_send_slow() when an iWARP
connection request is received.  This is because the new l2t_entry.arpq
skb queue is never initialized, and therefore trying to add an skb to
it causes a NULL dereference.  With the old code there was no need to
initialize the queues because the l2t_entry structures were zeroed,
and the code used NULL to mean empty.
Fix this by adding __skb_queue_head_init() when all the l2t_entry
structures get allocated.
