When I ping two linux machines on a private link, I get 0.1 ms delay.
When I send large TCP/IP stream data between them, I get almost
10 megabytes per second on a 100-base link. Wonderful.
However, if I send 64 bytes from one machine and send it back, simple
TCP/IP strean connection, it takes 1 millisecond to get it back? There
seems to be some artifical delay somewhere.  How do I turn this OFF?
Cheers,

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
