(hating to reply using Outlook, but forced :)
All the (current) new bootcode was written with the idea of "binary
level compatibility" firmly in mind. I had actually worked backward from
the original as86 output to come up with the equivalent gas instructions
when the assembly was questionable, simply because I knew that that encoding
worked. I did that with the idea that 'hey, if it compiles to the same
opcodes, were fine' -- that was the sole plan at the moment: to have a 2.4
kernel that doesn't need as86/ld86 to build.
Yes that makes the source wrong on a pure "syntax" level in quite a few
spots, but does it truly matter if (a) it assembles to the correct
opcodes, (b) gives some much needed testing and real life usage of gas,
so that it finally will do the right things when it comes to 16 bit asms,
and (c) is planned on being (for lack of a better word) "optimized" back
to correctness later on down the road (when everyone's using, or better
yet are forced to use, the latest binutils).
You bring up some valid points, but I feel the intent of the patch was
misjudged.
Just a few points on the latest binutils (which now might be a requirement
of the next 2.3):  The changes to the bootcode were intended to be
included with a kernel that had a minimum binutils of 2.9.1.0.7, because
I didn't feel it was worth a binutils upgrade to 2.9.5 to each and every
person in order to have "syntactic perfection" (due to the fact that only
the *latest* binutils produce the most correct code for most every case).
I just wanted joe user to be able to still compile, but without the
dependency on as86.
I've heard we might go to binutils 2.9.5 now, and if it happens I will
happily rework the code to be more clearly, properly written.
Hope that explains my thoughts a bit.
Thanks for the feedback.

I think this is still a 'work in progress'. I hope that somebody adds
a directive to gas that tells it to assemble 16-bit code so the source
code doesn't have to be wrong to get it to make 16-bit code. The
prefix 0x66 is a switch. It changes the default oprand size of the
processor. If the processor is in 32-bit mode, 0x66 is used to make
it do word, instead of longword operations.  If the processor is
in 16-bit mode, 0x66 prefix makes it do longword instead of the default
word operations. Therefore, an assembler needs to 'know' when to
not use 0x66. In other words it needs to know the current operation
mode of the processor.
Maybe a switch like ".i-32" (Intel 32-bit) ".i-16" (Intel 16-bit)
needs to be added to GAS.
