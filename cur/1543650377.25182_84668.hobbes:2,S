The i8xx draws the frame buffer memory from AGP as well as the texture
mappings and other goodies. The practical impact of that is that if you
want any useful video mode you need AGP initialized first. For UMA video
devices its an extremely neat way of avoiding pre-allocation of fixed
size frame buffers before the OS boots
