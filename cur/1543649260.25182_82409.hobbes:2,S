Oracle are not the only users of this, nor the only database in
the world (though they often think they are) ;-)
There is *something* in the kernel ... whether it's useful or not
is a matter of opinion - what we see as remaining to do is to 
provide hooks for generic interfaces (eg shmem, mmap, sbrk).

Would be if it wasn't needed to alleviate all the overhead incurred
by rmap. As it is, the extra ZONE_NORMAL load kills large boxes dead ;-( 
Will provide speedups for the fork+exec cycle for the low end too.
