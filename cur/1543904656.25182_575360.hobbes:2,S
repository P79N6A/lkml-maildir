    My understanding is that "ata" has been already used, so there's no sense 
in introducing "ide". Anyway, Segher will just say that "device_type" shoudn't 
matter and even be present. ;-)

    In my understanding, as "mmio-ide" currectly makes no sense, it shouldn't 
even appear there.  And since "mpc8349emitx-cf" (or whatever would be most 
generic name for those boards with the same type of CF IDE mapping) should be 
imply the shift value, this property should also be optional, i.e. passing 
hard coded value with platform_device would do.
MBR, Sergei
