It cuts the other way as well though.  If it is prohibitively hard and
difficult to get fixes out for bugs in the Linux kernel, then companies
will tend to choose other operating systems to run their applications on.
I guarantee you that IT managers and CTOs do not share your enthusiasm for
slow, correct coding when faced with their business being down, their
revenue stream being interrupted and their stock options losing value.  
If you ignore those concerns then you may find that wolf at your door as
IT managers choose other operating systems (e.g. FreeBSD, Solaris), kernel
developers choose other operating systems to work on (e.g. FreeBSD), and
Linux companies start going under.  
I'm really kind of surprised that companies like SuSE, VA and RedHat
haven't started talking about forking the kernel already.  Those companies
are serving the administrators and managers whose needs you are openly
admitting that you are not concerned with.  For those companies the
present state of affairs isn't sustainable.  
And I don't ask you to care about it.  I guess my point is just that the
linux kernel is an experiment in what happens when you ditch the managers
and administrators and business-types and try to write a major software
project entirely driven by developers.  I will place a friendly wager that
the experiment will show that not all the needs of those people are as
dismissable as many software developers seem to think.
