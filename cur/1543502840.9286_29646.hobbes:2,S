Hi,
The results I get are stable, ie 0 other running processes on an otherwise
quiescent system. I consistently get 120MB/s from the buffer-cache.
I now know this is due to the smaller page-cache index (or something
similar).
BTW: I get 20.25MB/s from my IDE Maxtor DiamondMax+ 5120 10GB harddisk. I
think that's quite fast, but there's lots of new faster SCSI disks
emerging.....
My processor is a Celeron 300A oc'd to 464Mhz, with a memory bus speed of
103Mhz. Since the level 2 cache of the celeron runs at full core speed (ie
464Mhz) memory performance rocks 8o) . Ideal for small (efficient)
algorithms. My memory is a unified (2 banks on 1 DIMM) 128MB 8ns DIMM,
working at CAS, RAS to CAS and RAS of 2. It's all tuned for speed, etc.
Email me for more info....
Dan
