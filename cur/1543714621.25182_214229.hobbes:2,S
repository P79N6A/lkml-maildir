It is DirectColor and setting the palette should work. If it doesn't
then we indeed have a bug, but so far, I didn't have any problems
with MacOnLinux which does fbdev and sets the palette properly not
with XFree which does also set the palette. In DirectColor, the
palette is actually a gamma table.

Yes, that's not a radeonfb problem. The current 2.6 fbcon driver is
completely broken in this regard imho. It tries to adapt the display
mode on stty and setfont, which usually doesn't work properly since it
can't calculate supported modes properly (well... radeonfb sort of can
but it's the only one who can and there are still issues). On the
other hand, it doesn't adapt properly to changes done via fbset.
I have done some workarounds for this but they triggered other bugs
in the fbcon driver at that time, some of them causing memory
corruption, so I didn't commit my changes upstream.
A bunch of this should have been fixed by now, I need to re-sync with
James Simmons and see if I can make that to work now.
