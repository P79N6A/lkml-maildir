You need the kernel side timeout. Consider this case
One page of memory holds the parking code
A second page is swapped to disk and holds the resume code
You park the disk
You wakeup
You got to page in the resume code
So you really do want the kernel helping to avoid a deadlock

Also puzzles me- why is this needed ?
