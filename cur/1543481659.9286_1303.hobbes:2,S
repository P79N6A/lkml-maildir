Ahem.  This is referring (in BOTH instances) to process/thread level.  No
'thread' can.  if you want to include via hooking an interrupt so be it, but
don't you think that's a little beyond the argument on either system?

Pfft.. Oh dear, it's been weeks since I laughed.  I think this was referring
to re-entrancy of and in the kernel.

Can someone more knowledgeable explain to me whether or not the KERNEL runs
on more than one processor..  I am curious, because that would be
interesting to hear.
