Was this announced on linux-kernel as well?  I don't remember seeing it.
I'm not convinced about the practicality of converting all static
initialisations to code-based initialisations though - I can see
that the number of initialisation functions scattered throughout
the kernel is going to increase dramatically to achieve this.
With a 2.4 to 2.6 kernel bloat already on the order of 140% for
similar functionality, I can only see the kernel getting more and
more bloated _for the same feature level_ because we're trying to
add more features to the kernel.
I'm not entirely convinced that is an all round sane approach.
