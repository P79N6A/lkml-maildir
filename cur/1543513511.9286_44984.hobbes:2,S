Since the problem is deterministic, why can't we check for this at
build time? I.e. right after the kernel is compressed run the
decompression code and see whether it runs out of heap space, then
issue an error, or automatically increase the heap size or
whatever. Just an idea.
On the other hand if simply increasing the heap fixes this for the
foreseeable future then maybe there's no point...
