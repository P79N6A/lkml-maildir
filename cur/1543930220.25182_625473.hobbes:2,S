Thanks.
Neil in your testing please confirm the preconditions for setting 
the Apic Extended Broadcast flag (bit 17) are present.
If that is the case it makes sense to always set that bit on conforming
systems but we will also want to print a message noting that the
BIOS has a bug, and we are working around it.
Thanks,
Eric
