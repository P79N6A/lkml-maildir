It's highly useful but poorly documented method of referencing 
repository B's objects from repository A.
When you clone locally
	git clone --reference linus-2.6 linus-2.6 nigel-2.6
it will create nigel-2.6 with zero objects, and an alternatives file 
pointing to 'linus-2.6' local repository.  When you commit, only the 
objects not already in linus-2.6 will be found in nigel-2.6.
It's far better "git clone -l ..." because you don't even have the 
additional hardlinked inodes, and don't have to run "git relink" locally.
