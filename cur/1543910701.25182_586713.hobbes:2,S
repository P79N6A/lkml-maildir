Subject: [PATCH for 2.6.23] i386: Mark NUMA support experimental
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/21/144

I did some testing and found quite a lot of problems (doesn't
boot at all on non NUMA and misassigns cores on Opteron systems).
Mark it as experimental and warn against its use for now.
It's still default y for SUMMIT/NUMAQ because it'll presumably
work on these systems.
