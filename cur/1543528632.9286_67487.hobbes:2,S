Subject: [PATCH] time.c kernel 2.2.14
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

If you decide to reply to this on the linux kernel mailing list, please CC your
response to my email.
This patch adds an option to kernel configuration to disable TSC skew
correction.  On SMP machines with two (or more) processors which run at
different speeds, the TSC code causes several problems.  This patch simply
disables the TSC code in the kernel.
Please note that this has not been extensively tested and may have significant
problems.  I am posting this patch because ideally, I'd like someone more
competant than me to fix the arch/i386/kernel/time.c code to automatically
disable TSC code when running on dissimilar dual-(or more)CPU SMP machines.
