Thanks for the clarification; I was thinking so but I appreciate to be sure.

I'll do that next time it crashes ;-( and keep you informed; however the
network is still working OK on this station: pings from the station to the
server and vice versa pass as fast as usual, xloads or xosview displayed on
X terminals work correctly, although the load average on the Linux (NFS
client) box is climbing to very unusual heights and quickly stabilize at
13-15 while CPU is 95% idle... (the load average on the Solaris server is
normal and it seems to continue serving other machines).
In all cases thank you for the prompt answer.
