patched against 2.5.24-dj1 (one failed hunk) generates errors:
# make clean
<snip>
make -C /aicasm clean
make: Entering an unknown directory
make: *** /aicasm: No such file or directory.  Stop.
make: Leaving an unknown directory
make[3]: *** [clean] Error 2
make[3]: Leaving directory 
`/usr/src/kernel/linux-2.5.24-dj1/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx'
make[2]: *** [aic7xxx] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/kernel/linux-2.5.24-dj1/drivers/scsi'
make[1]: *** [scsi] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/kernel/linux-2.5.24-dj1/drivers'
make: *** [_clean_drivers] Error 2
patching it against 2.5.24 (starting from 2.5.13 and patched up to) gives the 
same failed hunk as with 2.5.24-dj1
patching it against 2.5.24 (the tarball) generates a lot of failures and 
offsets...
so i would like to try it, but it just is not possible...
