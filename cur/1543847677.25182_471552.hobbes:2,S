Well as you know, lately we've had problems with 
invalidate_inode_pages2() failing to invalidate pages (regardless of
their state). So I was thinking truncate_inode_pages() might be
better for directories since there seem to be more a guarantee that
the pages will be gone with truncate_inode_pages() than
invalidate_inode_pages2() (due to the fact there will not be any
dirty pages).
But since you have to call truncate_inode_pages under the
inode->i_mutex, there might be a performance hit...
