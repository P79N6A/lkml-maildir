Subject: [PATCH mm] swapless page migration: fix fork corruption
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Several times while testing swapless page migration, gcc has tried to
exec a pointer instead of a string: smells like COW mappings are not
being properly write-protected on fork.
The protection in copy_one_pte looks very convincing, until at last you
realize that the second arg to make_migration_entry is a boolean "write",
and SWP_MIGRATION_READ is 30.
Anyway, it's better done like in change_pte_range, using
is_write_migration_entry and make_migration_entry_read.
