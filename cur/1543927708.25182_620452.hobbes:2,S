FWIW from a "real time" database POV this seems to make sense to me...
in fact, we probably rely on filesystem metadata way too much
(historically it's just "worked".... although we do seem to get issues
on ext3).
I have a (casually stupid) simulation program... although I've observed
little to no problems on all my XFS tests using it.
