indeed, there could be a connection, and it's certainly a fun race. The
proper fix is Manfred's suggestion: check whether the EIP is a kernel
text address, and if yes, whether it's a HLT instruction - and if yes
then increase EIP by 1. I've included the fix in the -33-02 -RT patch.
Andrew, Linus: upstream fix is below - i think it's post-2.6.10 stuff.
Tested it on SMP and UP x86, using both the IO-APIC and the local-APIC
based NMI watchdog.
i think x64 needs a similar fix as well.
