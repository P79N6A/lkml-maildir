hotkey.c was expected to replace all platform specific driver under
acpi directory, and I have ever expected that ACPI spec would define
standard device ID, and AML method name and event number for common keys
such as brightness control, output switch. So, I was expecting the hotkey.c
could become the generic driver when such spec was published and accepted
by OEMs. But, I don't know if such kind of things will happen.

So, if there are NO standards, and we don't want mess up user space tools with
a dozen of totally different acpi proc interface for different platform 
drivers. We have to use  generic code to create  unified interface for the 
sake of clean user space tool.  Some technique are:
1. use input layer to translate any hot-key event into key code defined in 
input.h
2. use backlight class (driver/video/backlight.c)  to hook generic brightness 
control interface for brightness control under sysfs. 
3. use output class to hook generic output switch control interface for 
display output switch control under sysfs.
4. other generic code.

I think the maintainer of asus_acpi, toshiba_acpi, ibm_acpi, sony_acpi, 
panasonic_acpi, msi_acpi, ... should use the techniques mentioned above.
for new platform, Please don't just fork a new driver from toshiba_acpi.c, or
the existing ones in drivers/acpi. They also need to use  generic code 
mentioned above.   Then, the platform specific driver could be accepted into 
mainline. Otherwise, I don't know how these kind of platform specific driver
can be maintained, and deployed by OSV.
