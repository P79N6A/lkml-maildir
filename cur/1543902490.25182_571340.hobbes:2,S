No need to blame anybody, especially since it seems that one more person
forgot about adding linux-ide ML.  ;)

The thing is that ide-{disk,scsi,tape} really don't support
REQ_TYPE_BLOCK_PC type requests so ide.c::generic_ide_ioctl()
is not the best place to add handling of SG_IO.

I still haven't got the trace.  Andrew, please (re)send it in PM, thanks.

Could be...

Fully agreed.
Thanks,

[PATCH] ide: add support for SCSI ioctls to ide-floppy
Now that ide-floppy supports SG_IO we can add support for SCSI ioctls
(except deprecated SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND and legacy CDROM_SEND_PACKET
ones - we can add them later iff really needed).
While at it remove handling of CDROMEJECT and CDROMCLOSETRAY ioctls from
generic_ide_ioctl():
- This prevents ide-{disk,tape,scsi} device drivers from obtaining
  REQ_TYPE_BLOCK_PC type requests which are currently unsupported by
  these drivers and which are potentially harmful (as reported by Andrew).
- There is no functionality loss since aforementioned ioctls will now be
  handled by idefloppy_ioctl()->scsi_cmd_ioctl() (for devices using
  ide-floppy driver) and by idecd_ioctl->cdrom_ioctl()->scsi_cmd_ioctl()
  (for devices using ide-cd driver).
