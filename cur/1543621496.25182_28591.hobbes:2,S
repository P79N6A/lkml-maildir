Subject: [BK PATCH] Merge e1000 gigabit driver (yay)

Linus,
I'm pleased to submit to you a BK merge of Intel's e1000 driver.  The
license is now "GPL or (BSD + patent grant)", which should satisfy those
concerns.
I would also like to publicly thank Intel for this work.  The two
contributors listed have been very responsive to feedback, and they have
put a good deal of work into beating the driver into shape for a kernel
merge.
Now I just hope I can convince them to open up their hardware specs :)
Kind regards,
	Jeff
