Subject: [patch] [sched] yield speedup, 2.5.3-pre5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/1/28/63

the attached patch speeds up sched_yield() context switch performance by
about 5%. (This patch depends on the previous bitmap-cleanup patch,
functionality-wise.)
instead of dequeueing/enqueue the task from the same array we can skip a
number of steps even in the generic case. If a yielded task has reached
maximum priority (as they do if they yield a number of times) then we can
skip even more steps - the task only has to be queued to the end of the
runqueue.
