Yes, indeed. I muttered about this long ago - let me see, yes,
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106271659930542&w=3
My patch did the opposite of your patch: I removed the
add entropy call in input.c.
I don't recall the details, but I think my reason was that some events
are synthetic, and I wanted all entropy calls to be derived from
actual outside sources.
Also, when there are several sources, all constant or almost constant,
then merging the streams might cause one to see variation where
there isn't really any.
Also that is a reason not to do the adding so far away from the source.
