TLS #3 overlaps BIOS 0x40, but code which calls borken APM / PnP BIOS 
and sets up protected mode 0x40 GDT segment does so by swapping out the 
TLS segment with the identity simulation of physical 0x400 offset, 
swapping it back afterwards.  Short of bugs in that code (which there 
are, btw), you shouldn't need to be concerned with it.
I believe 9,10,11 are reserved for future users like yourself or 
expanded TLS segments.  I think a bank of 3 TLS segments in the GDT is 
working fine now (does NPTL even use more than one?).

Totally movable, actually, just means breaking module dependencies.

That change is visible to userspace, unfortunately.

Nothing.
