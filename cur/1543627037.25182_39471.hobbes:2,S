Hi,
*read below for a problem report against the tulip network driver[1]
It looks like the bridging feature of the kernel has changed between 2.4.17
and 18.
I have a machine running 2.4.16 running as a bride without problem.  While
testing the network cards for another bridge I had to restart.
Unfortunately, it didn't complete.  Nothing would respond except for sysrq.
I was able to sync, unmount, and reboot successfully.
Debian does this for you automatically, but if you do it manually it does
the same thing.
o Setup a bridge like normal
o start it up
o ifconfig br0 down
o brctl delbr br0
*boom*
2.4.16,17 work just fine, but 2.4.18 does not.  Looking through the
changelog, 2.4.18-pre4, or 5 look suspect.  Also, it is not fixed in
2.4.19-pre6.  I can test the 2.4.18-pre kernels if you'd like, just let me
know.
[1] Also several times I was able to get my tulip network card to stop
forwarding packets after a soft-reboot from the lockup mentioned above.  I
was able to reproduce this in 2.4.17, 2.4.18, 2.4.19-pre3-ac4 (possibly
2.4.19-pre5-ac3 though didn't check to make sure but I used it several times
during my testing), and 2.4.19-pre6.  None of the other network cards in
this machine did this (3c509-isa, pcnet32-pci, eepro100-pci)
I don't have a serial cable ATM but I could buy one in a few days if a
ksymoopsed sysrq-t would help.
