Uhm.  So what happens when the user has stored into the page and now
the kernel wants to read from it?  There's still data in the cache for
the user mapping that's non-coherent with the kernel mapping.

Sure it does.  It affects whether other writes to that page show up in
the shared read-only mapping.
