This is something I've wanted for a very long time; if memory serves,
OpenBSD does it with a /proc (processes) and /kern (general
kernel-exported data), which always seemed like a logical division.
And with a proper sysctl() interface, there's no reason you couldn't do
/kern (or whatever) in userspace (think user-space NFS) if you just -had-
to have that information in filesystem form.
