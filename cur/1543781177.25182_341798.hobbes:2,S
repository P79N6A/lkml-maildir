This is from NetBSD 2.0:
sa_mask blocks other signals
SA_NODEFER does not block other signals
SA_NODEFER does not affect sa_mask
SA_NODEFER and sa_mask does not block sig
!SA_NODEFER blocks sig
SA_NODEFER does not block sig
sa_mask blocks sig
This is from SFU 3.5 on WinXP (*):
sa_mask blocks other signals
SA_NODEFER does not block other signals
SA_NODEFER does not affect sa_mask
SA_NODEFER and sa_mask blocks sig
!SA_NODEFER blocks sig
SA_NODEFER blocks sig
sa_mask blocks sig
(*) original signal.h did not define SA_NODEFER, so take this with a
grain of salt
