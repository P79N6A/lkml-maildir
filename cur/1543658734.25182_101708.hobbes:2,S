UTF8 delete behaviour should be pretty trivial to add.  It's liketly to
be more involved than simply adding a
	/* multi-char UTF8 thing? Continue until we hit the first one */
	if (tty->utf8 && (c & 0x80) && !(c & 0x40))
		continue;
to the loop in n_tty.c: eraser(), but it might not be _much_ more than
that.
