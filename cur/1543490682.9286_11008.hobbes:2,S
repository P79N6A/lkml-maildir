It looks like you haven't yet found a solution, so I'm going to try
stabbing at it...
This sounds exactly like what was happening with our Linux router when the
gc stuff wasn't cleaning up quick enough and new routes were being dropped
until enough packets got tossed out later that it started working suddenly
in a few seconds.  It seemed exactly like the ARPs weren't working as you
described; however, it doesn't have any relation to 2.2.1 vs 2.2.2, so it
may not be what you're experiencing.  I don't see any changes between
those kernels that would produce the problem you are seeing, though.
How loaded is your system?  Does it handle a lot of IP traffic to/from
different IPs?
If so, or for lack of anything better to try, perhaps try the following
which will disable the minimum cleanup interval and should always allow
new routes to be added to the route cache:
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/gc_min_interval
Note that apparently this problem has been fixed by Alexey's new routing
patch which looks like it just got folded into the 2.2.4 pres, so if in
fact this is the problem, it may be fixed in 2.2.4.  Let me know if in
fact it makes any difference. :)
