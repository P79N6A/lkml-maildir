Subject: rtl8187 rate control doesn't work

Hi
Now the compat-wireless-2.6 package is working and I get an Internet
connection with my rtl8187 based card. (It's on an ASUS P5B Deluxe)
I used the compat-wireless-2.6 package for this log, but I have the same
problem with the version integrated in kernel 2.6.24-rc6
The Access Point is some rooms away so the signal is not the best at my
location. When starting the device with no fixed rate it wants to
connect with 54MBit/s and as iwconfig says it was successful but I can't
ping any device in the wireless LAN. (it's the first part of the log)
The rate will not be slowed down it stays fixed at 54MBit/s.
After starting the device with rate fixed to 11M I get a connection to
the Access Point and iwconfig's output looks the same as without fixed
rate, but I'm able to ping the all devices in the network. (second part
of the log)
Now it slows down the rate to 1MBit/s
iwconfig looks like this (fixed rate to 11M):
wlan0 IEEE 802.11g  ESSID:"mehrtenswlan"
      Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Access Point: 00:1A:XX:XX:XX:XX
      Bit Rate=1 Mb/s   Tx-Power=27 dBm
      Retry min limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr=2352 B
      Link Quality=50/64  Signal level=16/65
      Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
      Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0
With no fixed rate there is an Bit Rate=54 Mb/s instead of 1Mb/s.
With rate fixed to 18MBit/s I have the same problem as with no fixed rate.
