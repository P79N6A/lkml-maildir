This is almost right after boot.  I generated about 40 bus resets just
to stir things up a little:

Also:
I couldn't cause the problem when using 4 Fireboard 800s through
several hundred bus resets (usually took <= 40 for the Indigita card)

Okay, so the code looks like this now:
                        DBGMSG("PhyReqFilter=%08x%08x",
                               reg_read(ohci,OHCI1394_PhyReqFilterHiSet),
                               reg_read(ohci,OHCI1394_PhyReqFilterLoSet));
                        reg_read(ohci, OHCI1394_IntMaskSet);
                        hpsb_selfid_complete(host, phyid, isroot);
                        DBGMSG( "IntEventClear %08x "
                                "IntEventSet %08x "
                                "IntMaskSet %08x",
                                reg_read(ohci, OHCI1394_IntEventClear),
                                reg_read(ohci, OHCI1394_IntEventSet),
                                reg_read(ohci, OHCI1394_IntMaskSet));
this is in 2.6.16-rt29 which has proved to be the easiest to provoke.
I actually couldn't get 2.6.18 to break earlier this morning (few
hundred resets).
Okay, I've lost host1 (on the Indigita), but this time the last print
statement is:
Nov 27 10:38:27 spanky kernel: ohci1394: fw-host1: IntEventClear
00000000 IntEventSet 04588000 IntMaskSet 818300f3
just like all the other hosts.  I can confirm that no bus reset
handlers are called, and there are another 4,000 lines of statements
from the other hosts after the last from host1.
