Subject: [PATCH] updated preempt-kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/10/20/2

Testers Wanted:
patches to enable a fully preemptible kernel are available at:
	
http://tech9.net/rml/linux
for kernels 2.4.10, 2.4.12, 2.4.12-ac3, and 2.4.13-pre5.
What is this:
A preemptible kernel.  It lowers your latency.
What is New:
* sync with new kernel releases
* if HIGHMEM_DEBUG was on the preempt counter would be incremented at
times but never decremented.  this resulted in preemption becoming
permanently disabled.
* if HIGHMEM_DEBUG was not on, HIGHMEM would crash the system horribly
due to a case where preemption was enabled without a corresponding
disable.
* reapply dropped hunk to pgalloc to prevent reentrancy onto per-CPU
data
The next few patches are going to work on identifying any remaining
per-CPU variables that need explicit locking under preemption.
