I tried with serial console. The only thing I get is:

================================================================================|
and nothing more. Well, this was done with the double console, so that I
will try again as soon as I have a bit of time with just the serial console
on. 
But the "external" behaviour for me is like your: it stops, then at restart
the HDD led stays on and nothing happen.
