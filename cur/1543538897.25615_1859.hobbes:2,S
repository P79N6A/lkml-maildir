	That is yet another alternative. The point is to put all of
the process killing logic in user-land - not to quibble about
possible implementations of such logic.

	Well, ok. Let's quibble. Assume, for sake of argument, that 
the kernel puts out a kernel log message whenever VM is low 
(as Rik pointed out, this is defined as:
	(total pages RAM + total pages swap) - (pages in ram+pages in swap) < some limit
)
	Now, also assume that we have a daemon that watches the 
kernel logs for said error message. (plug in to syslog, whatever)
	That daemon could be whatever you want. A family of ``warm fuzzy''
daemons for the desktop systems, or a hard-nosed server system,
or a combination. The point I'm trying to make is that it would
be in USERLAND, where you don't have to recompile the kernel to
produce major changes in how the near-OOM scenario will be handled.
Desktop
-------
	*) Pop-up window 
	*) Switch to inactive VT, text dialog
	*) Etc...
Server
------
	*) List of ``essential'' programs, not to kill unless completely necessary
	*) List of daemons to restart
	*) Some sort of expert system
	*) Etc...
