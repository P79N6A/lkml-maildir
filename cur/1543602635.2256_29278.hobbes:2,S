be careful with MAX_ARG_PAGES, because struct binprm is allocated on the
kernel stack, so if it's too big, the kernel stack will overflow in
unexpected places. A realistic limit is 1-2 MB, that causes a 1-2 KB
kernel stack footprint.
(ob'plug: or use the patch i posted, the size of struct binprm is constant
and small there :-)
