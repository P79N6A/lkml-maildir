No, not for a group. We could extend account_user_time() and
account_systime_time() in this regard.

I think the percentage of time when it didn't have any runnable task in
its runqueues.

Good point. I think we need to subtract out the time it was waiting on runqueue
when calculating idle time.

So, in this case, 
	idle time = (t4 - t3) / [ (t6 - t1) - (t2-t1) - (t5-t4) 
?
This idle time will be a per-cpu stat for every cgroup and needs to be
consolidated across cpus into a single idle-stat number, just like how
top does it.
