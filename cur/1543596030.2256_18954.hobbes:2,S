Hi!
What are the maximum socket buffer sizes for:
net.core.rmem.*
net.core.wmem.*
net.core.optmem_max
As far as i can tell these are ones to adjust when "tuning" 
e.g. the netlink sockets between the kernel and userspace?
I have not been able to find this information anywhere...
Best regards
Martin
