I am also getting strange effects. I boot into  2.6.11-rc4 and the
console fonts looks fine. Come back a day later and the console font has
  corrupt characters. E.g. Displays a "D" instead of an "L" and stuff
like that. It is mostly readable, except for a few characters.
It is only the local console that is corrupted. ssh into the box
displays correct characters, so all I can assume is that the VGA console
is being programmed with different characters. The bad characters also
survive a soft reboot( During BIOS boot up), until the linux kernel
starts booting, and then it switches to a good font.
