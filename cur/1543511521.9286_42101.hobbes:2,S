Hmm, there was a report a few days ago about something similar to this (from
<zinx@linuxfreak.com>, I believe). I did eventually spend about 30 seconds
trying to reproduce it, and failed. IIRC, the processes that were trying to
access the smb fs weren't SIGINTable but could be SIGKILL'd. I did notice at
work that it's impossible to smbumount smbfs's that were connected to dead or
rebooted servers. If I ever have any free time I might poke my nose into this,
after I've sorted out my current weird PPP problem (downloads max out the
connection, but uploads fizzle out and die..); is anyone actively maintaining
smbfs?
W.r.t the hanging processes, does ps l show anything useful, or does it just
give the address of __down or similar? If the latter, hacking the semaphore
deadlock detection stuff out of Andrea's IKD might be instructive, it's just
a few lines of code in sched.c, ISTR.
