John,
SG_IO ioctl users would normally expect to see DRIVER_TIMEOUT
(plus a suggest mask) in sg_io_hdr::driver_status when a
mid level timeout goes off. So that needs to be "wired"
in libata (along with some other transport errors I suspect).
Here is an example of a timeout using the scsi_debug driver:
# modprobe scsi_debug ptype=9 delay=200000
# lsscsi -g
[0:0:0:0]    comms   Linux    scsi_debug       0004  -         /dev/sg0
# sg_start /dev/sg0
start stop unit: transport: Driver_status=0x06 [DRIVER_TIMEOUT, SUGGEST_OK]
START STOP UNIT command failed
