Hi.
Version for rc4 is out (easy...):
http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~magallon/linux/kernel/2.4.18-rc4-jam1/
Aout reported floppy hangs: I have checked that it hangs even with
plain 2.4.17, and so have done other people, so I think it is not
an irqrate-A1 or sched-O1 problem.
Nobody uses floppy with 2.4.17 ?
Common patterns ?
Enjoy...
