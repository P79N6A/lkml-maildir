By the way, because of oops happens on early stage of boot,
you not need any image to reproduce this bug:
something like this will be enough:
1)cd /tmp/ && qemu-img create hda.img 10M
2)cd linux/mm/source/code
3)qemu -kernel arch/i386/boot/bzImage -hda /tmp/hda.img
if you add "-s" to qemu options you can after that do:
gdb vmlinux
$target remote localhost:1234
$br gth_timeout
$continue
