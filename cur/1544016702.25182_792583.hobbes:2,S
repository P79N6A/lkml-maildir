time advanced in 100ms
weight=2
64765.988352
67012.881408
88501.412352
weight=3
35496.181411
34130.971298
35497.411573
Measured from an RT shell doing..
   while sleep .1; do cat /proc/sched_debug >> /debug; done
..for a pinned chew.  Not necessarily gnats-arse accurate, but good
enough to see the margin of error is pretty high with weight=2.
