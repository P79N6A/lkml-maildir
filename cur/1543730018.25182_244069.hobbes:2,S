The arch specific SD_NODE_INIT was the missing piece from previous -mm 
releases.  Now that it's there, things seem to work.  I still have to poke 
around to see if there are places where we're trying to scan across all CPUs 
looking for busy ones and *then* checking to see if they're in a domain.  
John said he'd take a closer look.
