Seems sane to me.
It needs to handle %z as well as %Z.
The layout of `struct kern_log_entry' may be problematic.  Think of the
situation where a 64-bit kernel constructs one of these and sends it up to
32-bit userspace.  Will the structure layout be the same under the 32-bit
compiler as under the 64-bit one?
How do you actually intend to use this?  Will it be by adding new
evt_printf() calls to particular drivers, or replacing existing printk's or
both?
Would it make sense for evt_printf() to fall back to printk() if nobody is
listening to the log stream?
