I am connected to my Linux server via a 56kb modem with PPP. I can

skunkworks -> quark == PPP
The +++ sequence in a packet can't affect the modem because you 
need at least 500ms (lowest you can set it) of quiet after the sequence to
change its mode. The data strings will never be the last thing sent, so
you can't get 500ms between characters no matter how hard you try.
That said, please do `ps` and see if whatever you used to start your
PPP link (chat or whatever) is still running. If it is, it might still
have your ttyS?? channel open and be echoing something that could
screw things up.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
