I'd say that it should be safe, I would think, to allow for an option that
would allow this maybe through the parallel port... I know that there's a
console-on-serial option, but I don't have a serial printer.  I have a
parallel dot matrix.
I think that there should be an option in the kernel that would allow for
selective messages (i.e., just oops or whatever, user configurable in make
*config) directly to /dev/lp0 or /dev/lp1.
