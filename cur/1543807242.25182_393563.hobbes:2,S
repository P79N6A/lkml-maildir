Why do people always thing a source code control system is magically going
to fix all bugs and wipe their ass for them?
You still have to work out which patches are relevant and merge them. If 
he's just merging a new set of changes constantly, it won't help you a damn. 
What is needed is somebody to do the grunt work, not SCM magic. I'll try to
help with Randy's suggestion of a shared pool of patches in a common dumping 
ground at least - I've needed pretty much the same thing in the past for the 
test.kernel.org stuff ... mainly fixups needed to get the tree to boot so
we can test it.
