Quite.  It should be `busaddr_t'.  `physaddr_t' should be reserved for
physical addresses that only the mm layer sees...

A bus address is not a pointer...

Obfuscation?  If it's made mandatory right away I agree.  If it's the
wrong name, I agree.  (kphysaddr_t is the wrong name).  If it has the
wrong semantics: i.e., it doesn't always hold a bus address, I agree.
But if it does have a consistent meaning how can you call it
obfuscation?
Bear in mind that unsigned long is the *wrong* type (on x86 with 64-bit
PCI), though that hasn't arrived yet.  And char * is also the wrong
type.

This is clearly not true: we have device drivers that _ought_ to work on
many architectures but don't because they make assumptions they
shouldn't.  This doesn't stop the drivers getting written and used for a
long time, and that makes changes to the core architecture, as well as
porting, difficult.
I favour not only the typedefs, but structs for catching mis-typing when
enough drivers have been cleaned up (as with ptes at one time).
