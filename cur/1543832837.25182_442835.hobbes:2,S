The deprecation I believe actually predates feature-remove-schedule.txt
From include/linux/sysctl.h

And I can't actually find any user space applications that continue
to use sys_sysctl.
So the combination of the two patches and makes the deprecation official,
and makes it a compile time option so we can disable sys_sysctl now,
but still have recourse if some parts of user space need the code.
Currently the we dup the internal helpers which makes maintenance
of the code a nightmare.
