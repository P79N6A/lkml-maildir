There's an interesting security implication here.  I used to think 
"why don't they make a device node instead of exporting
numbers, udev could then simply make a link to it"
It'd be simpler, and the minimalists could use the node in sysf directly.
The security advantage is that we don't get a device with some default
permissions that might get abused.  The udev config can decide
to create a node with stricter than usual permissions, or decide
to not make the node at all.
