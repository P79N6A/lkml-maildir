The ISO_8859_1 acute accent, u with diaeresis, and registered sign, have been in Config.info since Feb 2002.
Andy's tools seem to have extended them to 16-bit characters during a merge.  A "minor gaff"?  Okay, I guess that's fair.  He promises that he doesn't know how to type a latin capital A with a circumflex on his keyboard;-).
Moving on...  Is the fix to restore the 8-bit characters, or use 7-bit characters?
Thanks,
-Len

Bug Intel, not me.
I personally think they shouldn't be changing non-ACPI-related 
Configure.help entries at all, and what you point out was one of the 
minor ACPI gaffs I mentioned to Marcelo and Alan.
