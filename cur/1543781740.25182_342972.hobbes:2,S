Maybe the distros need to just increase the default FD limit to 1024.  I
hit this constantly with gtk-gnutella, if try to download a file that's
available on more than 1024 hosts it will open sockets until it hits
that limit then bomb out.
1024 seems way too low these days given the proliferation of "swarming"
P2P protocols like gnutella and bittorrent.
