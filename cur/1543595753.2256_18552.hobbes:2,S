Updatedb fills memory full of clean file pages so there's nothing to flush.  
Did you mean "evict"?
Roughly speaking we treat clean pages as "instantly relaimable".  Eviction 
and reclaiming are done in the same step (look at reclaim_page).  The key to 
efficient mm is nothing more or less than choosing the best victim for 
reclaiming and we aren't doing a spectacularly good job of that right now.
There is a simple change in strategy that will fix up the updatedb case quite 
nicely, it goes something like this: a single access to a page (e.g., reading 
it) isn't enough to bring it to the front of the LRU queue, but accessing it 
twice or more is.  This is being looked at.
Note that we don't actually use a LRU queue, we use a more efficient 
approximation called aging, so the above is not a recipe for implementation.
