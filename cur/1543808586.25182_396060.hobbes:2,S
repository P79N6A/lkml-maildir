I'd like to get some short but, however, fully descriptive statements about how
you do your module development. I mean, what your way of doing coding,
insmod-ing, rmmod-ing, ... And what about code, that cannot be <M>, just [*] or
must-be-built-in.
Hm, actually there's nothing more to say. Except that I'm tired of rebooting. ;)
I tried kexec() but somehow I dont have all IDE devices sometimes on 'kexec -e'.
So this just not a solution for me... :)
