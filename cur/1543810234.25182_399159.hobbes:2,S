I still do not see a need to do that at clone() time
but I assume you have your reasons for postulating this ...

here I agree, changes between *spaces should be independant 
from exex(), but IMHO there is no need to reuse existing
interfaces for that, a syscall will do fine here ...

I don't see why not have both, the auto-created
*space on clone() and the ability to create empty
*spaces which can be populated and/or entered

hmm, sounds like a misnomer to me ...

definitely by some system-unique identifier ...
