#for-akpm is usually only in very few -mm release anyway, so it's not
like it would have made much difference. We/you/I need to improve that,
certainly.
Honestly, for bsg, it wasn't much of an issue. We had build problems
when bsg was merged which was unfortunate but got fixed quickly. Having
bsg in -mm would not have caused any testing of the driver in question
outside of what it already received, given the nature of it.
