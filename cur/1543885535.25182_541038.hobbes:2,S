We need to point out _one_ of the faulty spots only.
But I see that kconfig records file:line for properties and menu entries
but not for symbols.
Any special reason why file:line is omitted for symbols (except size of allocated
memory)?
Without looking into details it looks more relevant to have file:line for symbols
rather than for prompts / properties..
