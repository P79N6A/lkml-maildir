See attachment. I was lucky: On the first run with strace
mplayer could play the DVD (still using Tron). But this was
not reproducible.
Both strace files are attached. Hope this helps.
I noticed something else: If I run regionset to report the
supported region, then it returns on 64bit:
% regionset
regionset version 0.1 -- reads/sets region code on DVD drives
Current Region Code settings:
RPC Phase: Unknown (I)
type: NONE
vendor resets available: 0
user controlled changes resets available: 0
drive plays discs from region(s): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, mask=0x00
I am pretty sure that this drive is not region-free. On 32bit
(booting grml-0.9 from CD on a 2nd drive) I get the expected
"region 2 only". Of course I used the same 32bit executable.
Regards
Harri
