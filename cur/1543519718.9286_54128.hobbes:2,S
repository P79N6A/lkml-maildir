Does it really matter if config.mk is in /boot/config.mk-VERSION
or /usr/src/linux-VERSION/config.mk for Joe Average ? Not really.
Do I often compile kernels that I do not install on the same machine?
Yes. In that case, there is no /boot/config.mk-VERSION for that
kernel. There is however an unpacked and configured kernel source.
In fact I sometimes have several kernels of the same version unpacked
in different directories with different configs. In that case,
/boot/config.mk-VERSION would not work at all.
You really need to take _all_ considerations into account.
Mike.
