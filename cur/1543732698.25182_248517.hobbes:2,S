If you can find a way for a user to exploit this it's an issue.  Looks
like it's not, and doesn't warrant such a big change as your patch.
The fact that you introduce a new field and then almost always supply it
with NULL is a clue that it's not the right direction IMO.  Something
simple (as you mentioned) that grabs i_sem and rechecks during suid
setup in binprm_prepare is sufficient.  Worth it?  Guess I'm not
convinced.
