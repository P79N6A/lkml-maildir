These patches cause a lockup during execuion of `halt -p'.  See phuzzy foto

It's fairly obvious why, when one looks at lock_timer_base().

The above helpers seem rather verbose and cumbersome.  Looking at the

I expect you'll find that the generated code could be improved by
tightening those functions up a bit.
For example,
static inline void timer_set_deferrable(struct timer *timer)
{
	timer->base = (struct timer_list *)((unsigned long)timer->base |
			TBASE_DEFERRABLE_FLAG);
}
And I don't think we need the _flag in the names: timer_set_deferrable(),
timer_deferrable(), etc.
And the patch uses `unsigned long' everywhere to represent a flag which
can be 0 or 1.  It would be better to use unsigned int.
