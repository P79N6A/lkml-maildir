    I had *exactly* the same problem. 2.6.13 honors the "sync" mount
option for VFAT, that's the reason.
    Even if your device has wear leveling built in, you better not
use "sync" on a flash device. If you search the mailing list archives
(try searching for my nick "DervishD" and "usb-storage") you can see
that this issue was discussed before. I think it was a month ago,
maybe a bit more.
