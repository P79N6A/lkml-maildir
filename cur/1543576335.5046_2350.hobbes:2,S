Beta release v1.11 of the UPX executable compressor 
http://upx.tsx.org
offers new, tighter re-compression of compressed Linux kernels for x86.
Additional space savings of about 15% have been seen using
"upx --best vmlinuz" (example: 617431 ==> 525099, saving 92332 bytes).
Both source (GPLv2) and pre-compiled binary for x86 are available.
