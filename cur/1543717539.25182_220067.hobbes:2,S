Of course, this is a good reason to do a __builtin_constant_p()
wrapper that gcc can optimize:
static __inline__ __attribute_const__ int ffs(int x)
{  
	if ( __builtin_constant_p(x) ) {
		unsigned int y = (unsigned int)x;
		if ( y >= 0x80000000 )
			return 32;
		else if ( y >= 0x40000000 )
			return 31;
		else if /* ... you get the idea ... */
	} else {
		__asm__("bsfl %1,%0\n\t"
			"cmovzl %2,%0" 
			: "=r" (r) : "rm" (x), "r" (-1));
		return r+1;
	}
}
