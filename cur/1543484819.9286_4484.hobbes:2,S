Oh, please. _Hurd_ is your idea of a fancy new project? Look, the Mach 
microkernel is hardly a new idea. In theory, it was great. In
practice, not so great. This hasn't changed in at least ten years. My
objection to Hurd isn't because I fear change; it's because I used to
have a Mach-based machine on my desk, and I have no desire to do so
again.
It's not enough for an idea to be different. It also has to be good.
The flip side of this fear of change you see is endless hordes of
people constantly reinventing the wheel. How many crappy X toolkits do 
we need? Instead of writing two or three new windowing systems that
will probably never be finished, why not just try to improve the
existing ones?
Look at Berlin. I don't think it's necessarily a poor idea, but I do
have serious doubts about whether it will eve be finished. And even if 
it is, what chance does it have of displacing X?
