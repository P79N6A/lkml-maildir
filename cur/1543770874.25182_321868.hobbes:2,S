AFAIK in the i386 "toy" implementation, when a CPU is offlined, it stops
taking interrupts and stops running tasks, but it _still_ executes a while
loop in the context of its idle task (with IRQs disabled). The loop
is exited when we have to bring online the CPU again. What this means is 
I don't think by offlining the CPU, we are removing any activity associated
with the corresponding h/w thread. 
Maybe the toy implementation could be modified to take care of it? Something
like lowering the priority of the h/w thread so that it consumes minimal 
CPU resources to execute its while loop.
