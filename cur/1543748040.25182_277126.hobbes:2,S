If you make that change, at least also change the caller of __is_prefetch
As the patch stands it will break the build of fault.c - I suspect you 
didn't compile test it.??
Also, addr gets passed in to is_prefetch() from several different 
locations before it gets passed on to __is_prefetch() - are you sure it's 
correct to just remove the function argument - can you prove that it does 
no harm? could it be that the correct fix would be to actually use it for 
something instead?  I don't know the code enough to be able to answer 
that, but I think it's a good question that needs to be answered.
What kernel source is this against? it doesn't seem to apply to my 
2.6.10-rc3-bk2 tree here.
