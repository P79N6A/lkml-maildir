The performance relative to mutual exclusion is quantifiable and very
reproducible. These results have people using arguments similar to what
you made above baffled. Systems as small as 4 logical cpus feel these
effects strongly, and it appears to scale almost linearly with the
number of cpus. It may be worth consulting an x86 processor architect
or similar to get an idea of why the counterargument fails. I'm rather
interested in hearing why as well, as I believed the cacheline bounce
argument until presented with incontrovertible evidence to the contrary.
As far as performance relative to RCU goes, I suspect cases where
write-side latency is important will arise for these. Other lockless
methods are probably more appropriate, and are more likely to dominate
rwlocks as expected. For instance, a reimplementation of the radix
trees for lockless insertion and traversal (c.f. lockless pagetable
patches for examples of how that's carried out) is plausible, where RCU
memory overhead in struct page is not.

I suppose if it's not headed toward mainline the counterexamples don't
really matter. I don't have much to say about the RT-related issues,
though I'm aware of priority inheritance's infeasibility for the
rwlock/rwsem case.
