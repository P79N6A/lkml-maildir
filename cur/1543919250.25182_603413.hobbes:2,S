The rules for using sysfs information are currently only laid out for
the driver model. We would need similar rules for every other user of
kobjects.
This only works if we make the following the general rules:
- You may not rely on any information in sysfs to be present.
- Exceptions to that rule are documented for that special user of sysfs.
