yeah, it should have. In any case, things are looking good so far with 
your fixes. (Any suggestions wrt. how to trigger as many different 
codepaths in the networking code as possible, to increase coverage of 
locking scenarios mapped? I've tried LTP so far, and a few ad-hoc tests.  
Perhaps there's some IP protocol tester i should try, which is known to 
trigger lots of boundary conditions?)
