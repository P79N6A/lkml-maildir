I don't currently see any strong application motivation to provide this
kind of functionality in a general purpose 2D API, and so it wouldn't
make a lot of sense to push this into the 2D-centric X protocols either.
When that changes, we'll want to explore how best to provide that
functionality. One possibility is to transition applications to a pure
GL drawing model, perhaps using glitz as a shim between the 2D and 3D
worlds. That isn't currently practical as our GL implementations are
missing several key features (FBOs, accelerated indirect rendering,
per-component alpha compositing), but those things are all expected to
be fixed at some point.
The real goal is to provide a good programming environment for 2D
applications, not to push some particular low-level graphics library.
