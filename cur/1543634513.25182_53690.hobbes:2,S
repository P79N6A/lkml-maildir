Most of those buyers care about cost efficiency, not design
efficiency.  If a 4 way Dell can just match a 2 way Sun, and for
half the cost, guess who gets the sale.  Doesn't matter if it's
"naive" SMP or a beautiful cross-bar design, blessed by MIT.  Yes,
it's ugly.  Sure, it would be nice if everyone loved computing so
much that they actually cared enough to make the distinction.  They
don't.  Get over it.
As long as Linux is true to the market it will thrive.  The moment
the motivation becomes someone's pedantic notion of "purity", it's
gone.  I believe Linus understands this, and I'm thankful.  I'm
guessing that gift of understanding comes from a time when a certain
programmer couldn't afford to pay for the elegance that was offered
at the time.
