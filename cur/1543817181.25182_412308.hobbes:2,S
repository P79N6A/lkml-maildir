Again, see do_generic_mapping_read()'s ghastly tricks - it checks i_size
after each readpage().
i_size can increase or decrease under our feet if we're not holding i_mutex
(and we don't want to).  So userspace is being silly and the main things we
need to care about here are to not leak uninitialised data and to not oops.
A readpage() outside i_size will return either all-zeroes or some valid
data which isn't actually within i_size any more, so I guess we're OK.
