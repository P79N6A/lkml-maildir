That does it!
Works:
	mount -t udf /dev/hdc /mnt/dvdrom/
Shows no complaints, no log entries, and no files:
	mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdc /mnt/dvdrom/
	mount /dev/hdc /mnt/dvdrom/
Does anyone want the first few K of this DVD to see why the autodetection
is not working better?  Do you want me to upgrade past Kernel 2.4.2-2 first?
Is RedHat 7.2's kernel good enough?
Thanks!
