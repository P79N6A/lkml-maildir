yeah. I thought about that too, the problem i found is this thing in the 
old lib/semaphore-sleepers.c code's __down() path:
        remove_wait_queue_locked(&sem->wait, &wait);
        wake_up_locked(&sem->wait);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&sem->wait.lock, flags);
        tsk->state = TASK_RUNNING;
that mystery wakeup once i understood to be necessary for some weird 
ordering reason, but it would probably be hard to justify in the new 
code, because it's done unconditionally, regardless of whether there are 
sleepers around.
And once we deviate from the old code, we might as well go for the 
simplest approach - which also happens to be rather close to the mutex 
code's current slowpath - just with counting property added, legacy 
semantics and no lockdep coverage.

great! Meanwhile a 100 randconfigs booted fine with that tree so i'd say 
the implementation is robust.
i also did a quick re-test of AIM7 because the wakeup logic changed a 
bit from what i tested initially (from round-robin to strict FIFO), and 
as expected not much changed in the AIM7 results on the quad:
  Tasks   Jobs/Min        JTI     Real    CPU     Jobs/sec/task
  2000    55019.9         96      211.6   806.5   0.4585
  2000    55116.2         90      211.2   804.7   0.4593
  2000    55082.3         82      211.3   805.5   0.4590
this is slightly lower but the test was not fully apples to apples 
because this also had some tracing active and other small details. It's 
still very close to the v2.6.25 numbers. I suspect some more performance 
could be won in this particular workload by getting rid of the BKL 
dependency altogether.
