Right, but then my card refuses to dma into anything with address smaller
than 04000000.
I have thought of doing get_free_page until I have enough of pages with
large addresses (and then free all the small ones as 64mb is a finite
amount) but this would place a big load on the system during buffer
allocation.
I was hoping for something more elegant, but I am not adverse to writing
my own get_free_page_from_range().
