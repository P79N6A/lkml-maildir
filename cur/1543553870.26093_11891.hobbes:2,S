Jeff, in x86 alone, there are 13 different compile targets (2.4 tree),
soon to be more when Cyrix III & Pentium IV get added.
Although it doesn't make sense on all of these, it's possible to
compile any of them with SMP support too.
That's 30 different combinations.
Suggesting to put all these into one file isn't a bad idea,
it's bordering on insanity. What do you hope to achieve by doing
this, apart from the end user not having to choose a custom kernel
for their architecture ? Much better to have several kernels built
seperately for each arch, and have the user pick which one
(or even have the distro installer autodetect) at install time,
as SuSE, Red Hat, Mandrake, and several other distros are now doing.
Everything all in one may be the way NT does it, but that does not
mean it's a good idea. In fact it's anything but a good idea.
Please don't try to bring the braindamages of NT to Linux, it
just isn't meant to happen.
regards,
Davej.
