Subject: [PATCH 2.6.9-rc1 0/3] zlib_inflate and ppc32 changes

Hi.  This series of patches first changes zlib_inflate/ to be more
easily picked at by moving some non-core functions into their own file.
Next, this switches zlib_inflate_trees_fixed(...) from using a static
table, to generating that table.  This can save us up to 4kB from the
vmlinux (ppc32) and when used in the boot/ code, up to 8kB.  Finally, we
switch arch/ppc/boot/ from using it's own version of zlib to using
lib/zlib_inflate.  All of this should also lead the way for
lib/inflate.c going away.
