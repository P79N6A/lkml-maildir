I've kind of opposite here. with rc2-mm2 boot message says that fixup is 
applied. "athcool stat" says 'c1 bit disabled'.
Everything stable. When I enable that bit with "athcool on" the system 
will lock up solid after an hour or so.
With 2.6.1-rc1-mm1 I could enable that bit manually and everything was 
still stable afterwards ...
