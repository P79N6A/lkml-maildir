Not in kernel but userspace, seems like Linux:
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/dynamic_pager.8.html
     The dynamic_pager daemon manages a pool of external swap files which the
     kernel uses to support demand paging.  This pool is expanded with new
     swap files as load on the system increases, and contracted when the swap-swapping
     ping resources are no longer needed.  The dynamic_pager daemon also pro-provides
     vides a notification service for those applications which wish to receive
     notices when the external paging pool expands or contracts.
