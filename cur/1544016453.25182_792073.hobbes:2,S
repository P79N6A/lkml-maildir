Ok, numbers first, incremental below:
* dbench 50 (higher is better):
spin        1282MB/s
v10         548MB/s
v10 no wait 1868MB/s
* 4k creates (numbers in files/second higher is better):
spin        avg 200.60 median 193.20 std 19.71 high 305.93 low 186.82
v10         avg 180.94 median 175.28 std 13.91 high 229.31 low 168.73
v10 no wait avg 232.18 median 222.38 std 22.91 high 314.66 low 209.12
* File stats (numbers in seconds, lower is better):
spin        2.27s
v10         5.1s
v10 no wait 1.6s
This patch brings v10 up to v10 no wait.  The changes are smaller than
they look, I just moved the need_resched checks in __mutex_lock_common
after the cmpxchg.
