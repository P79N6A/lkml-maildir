gah, diff(1) is actually not new to me, but I forgot to use it :(
Thanks for spotting this!

I tried to be "super-keen" and applied x.bz2 to pristine 2.6.17-rc4, but 
the scsi error persists (logs, .config coming in a few minutes.)
Furthermore, I had to do 2 more things to get rc4-mm* compiling:
1) apply the attached patch, as the compile breaks with:
      CC      drivers/pci/msi-apic.o
In file included from include/asm/msi.h:11,
                  from drivers/pci/msi.h:71,
                  from drivers/pci/msi-apic.c:8:
include/asm/smp.h:103: error: syntax error before '->' token
make[2]: *** [drivers/pci/msi-apic.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/pci] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
(this has been reported with 2.6.17-rc3-mm1, but was not fixed?)
2) disable CONFIG_ROOT_NFS=y, as the compile breaks with:
   GEN     .version
   CHK     include/linux/compile.h
   UPD     include/linux/compile.h
   CC      init/version.o
   LD      init/built-in.o
   LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
fs/built-in.o: In function `nfs_root_setup':nfsroot.c:(.init.text+0x1809): 
undefined reference to `root_nfs_parse_addr'
:nfsroot.c:(.init.text+0x1810): undefined reference to `root_server_addr'
fs/built-in.o: In function `nfs_root_data': undefined reference to 
`root_server_path'
fs/built-in.o: In function `nfs_root_data': undefined reference to 
`root_server_addr'
As said before, .config and dmesg for rc4-mm2 in a moment, netconsole is 
not working...hm.
Thank you!
Christian.
