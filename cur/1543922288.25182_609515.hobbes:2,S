This was a question. I was perfectly aware that iptables alone
does not prohibit binding, and there are reasons to inhibit binding.
But sometimes, a coder does not know where to start - chances are,
that someone else wanting to do bind(2) inhibiting is doing it
with a syscall table change. Or coder did not notice that a firewall
is sufficient for the task to be achieved (which is not always the
case - hence the question).
