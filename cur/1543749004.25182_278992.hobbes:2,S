This is something which is requested countless times.  Everybody doing
development of sophisticated programs adds some kind of self
monitoring.  And there is of course profiling.  The most widely used
program which needs this is probably the JVM.  Don't ask me for the
specific class, but the JVM developers asked for these clocks in this
form.  Without the support available the Linux JVM is never going to
reach par.
