Yes. I had those pages not mapped at all earlier. The reason I switched
to zero page is to continue support cases like:
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009cc00 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000000009cc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000cc000 - 00000000000d0000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000e4000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 00000000cff60000 (usable)
In this case if some one does a dd of /dev/mem before they can read the
contents of usable memory in 0x100000-0xcff60000 range. But, if I not
map reserved regions, dd will stop after fist such hole. Even though
this may not be a good usage model, I thought there may be apps
depending on such things. Having said that, I do not like having dummy
zero page there very much. So, if we do not see any regressions due to
usages like above, I will be happy to remove mapping reserved regions
altogether.
Thanks,
