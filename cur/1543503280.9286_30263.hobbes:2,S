Hi Alan.

Along the lines of...
 Q> cd /usr/src
 Q> bunzip2 < lka/4/2.2/linux-2.2.10.tar.gz | tar xv
 Q> mv linux linux-2.2.10
 Q> cp linux-2.2.8/.config linux/2.2.10
 Q> cd linux-2.2.10
 Q> make oldconfig
 Q> make dep clean modules modules_install bzImage
For reference, /usr/src/lka is a symlink to ~ftp/lka and the latter is
where I keep my masters of the Linux Kernel Archives cd's with all the
kernel tarballs in, plus your prepatches where I have them.
Note also that /usr/src/linux normally doesn't exist on my system.

Nodz - that makes sense...

No idea - the only labels on the cards are printed on the chips
themselves, no serial numbers, model numbers, nothing like that. When
I got them, the important thing was that they worked with Linux, and
I took several models back because they didn't before settling on the
ones that did...
Just a thought, but do the ne2k ethernet cards actually need the full
32 io ports, or do they use less? If the latter, presumably the above
could be tweaked such that they only get allocated 0x360 to 0x377 in
this case, thus not clashing with the printer port?
Best wishes from Riley.
