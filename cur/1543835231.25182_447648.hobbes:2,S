I won't rule anything out, but for some it'll be impossible (such as
i386). It'll depend on the exact architecture I suppose.. for x86_64 a
gcc patch was needed (which took MONTHS to get in), I don't know how ppc
and such deal with this, I'll be talking to the respective maintainers
about this in the near future.... but I would not call it "fairly
generic".
