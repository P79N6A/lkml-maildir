Thomas did a great job of explaining and without any flaming or ad
hominem attacks.
We have now formed a decent plan for doing the accounting in a stable
way without adding new fields to sk_buff, thankyou for the catch.

The virtual block device can refcount the network device on virtual
device create and un-refcount on virtual device delete.  We need to
add that to the core patch and maybe package it nicely so the memalloc
reserve/unreserve happens at the same time, in a tidy little library
function to share with other virtual devices like iSCSI that also need
some anti-deadlock lovin.
