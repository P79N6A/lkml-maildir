So true... but for that bloat you get your oops and panic messages
on the screen, get cooperation with the VM, and reduce latency.
Other platforms? You're dreaming if you think they matter.
If video had been in Linux from the start, XFree86 would not be
alive today and that would have pretty much killed BSD. (OK w/ me)
Even today, I strongly suspect that XFree86 (and most of GNU BTW)
couldn't live without Linux providing developers.
