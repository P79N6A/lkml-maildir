I probably should add that with "original" stack back trace a trace of
a 2.6.10 kernel was meant, if that wasn't clear, but the DM code is
still the same in 2.6.14.

This part of the call trace is actually good for >1500 bytes of stack
usage and is what kills us and should be fixed.
I'm surprised that there are no other bug reports regarding DM and
stack overflow with 4k stacks.

Yes, you're right. Just forget the do_mount() patch. It's the wrong approach.
