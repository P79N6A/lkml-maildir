Maybe my misunderstanding of the code, but:
Looking at the code, it seems to me that try_to_freeze() will be called very 
likely from the signal-delivery path (get_signal_to_deliver()). Isnt
that correct? If so, consider a thread as below:
 Thread1 :
	for_each_online_cpu() { online_map = 0x1111 at this point }
		do_some_thing();
			kmalloc(); <- blocks
Can't Thread1 be frozen in the above blocking state w/o it voluntarily 
calling try_to_freeze?  If so, online_map can change when it returns
from kmalloc() ..

Fundamentally, I think it is important to give the ability to block
concurrent hotplug operations from happening ..
