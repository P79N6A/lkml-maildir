It seems fairly low risk to me; its basically the same structure with
the same calls happening in the same order, but just slightly rearranged
in the source.  Of course, if I'd seen this patch earlier I could have

Yeah, the kpte_clear_flush change helped as well.  I have a patch to
make that into a pvop as well, since its useful to do the clear+flush in
a single call.
