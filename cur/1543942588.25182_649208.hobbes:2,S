There a company that is providing a common API for writting Windows
and Linux drivers. Last time I was using a Macraigor JTAG it was based
on this proprietary dual platform driver.

The dual platform driver was from Jungo.

WinDriver™ USB for Linux automates and simplifies the development of
user-mode Linux device drivers and hardware control applications for
USB peripheral devices. No Linux kernel knowledge or kernel level
programming required.
