That file has a one bit error on download[*] and fails the bunzip CRC
checks.  New copy uploaded as kbuild-2.5-common-2.5.8-3.bz2.  No
change, new name to defeat http caching.  -2 had the same problem,
hence -3.
[*] Might be the upload, might be sourceforge, might be the local
    Telstra web proxy.  DKDC, do a fresh copy just in case.
