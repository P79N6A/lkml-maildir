Hi Ingo,
I just tried it on my main machine (SMP Dual Athlon MP, with a Gig of
RAM), and I just got the following dump on boot-up.  It never made it to
a prompt.

This looks like it was triggered by bounce_copy_vec calling kmap_atomic
which is now just kmap with irqs disabled.  Does this need to change to
__kmap_atomic?  Is this also used to make things more preemptible, and
start removing the local_irq_saves?  I'd like to know so that you don't
need to make the patches yourself and I can handle things like this, but
I need to know what the general ideas are.  Also, am I the only one that
has highmem support enabled, because this looks like this bug would have
been triggered by anyone.
Thanks,
-- Steve
