Hi,
They are the maximum amount of time that a send or receive call will
block for. The standard socket error returns apply, so if data has
been sent or received, then the return value will be the amount of
data transferred; if no data has been transferred and the timeout
has been reached then -1 is returned with errno=EAGAIN just as if the socket
was specified to be nonblocking. If the timeout is set to zero (the default)
then the operation will never timeout.
Steve.
