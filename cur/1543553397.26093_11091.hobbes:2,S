Subject: Sample device driver - 2.2 and 2.4 support?

I've been assigned a device driver that uses the old (2.0) PCI
support APIs - and is still working on 2.2.
I need to get this driver working on 2.2 and 2.4, I'm assuming I'll
need to go switch to the newer PCI stuff - but am curious about the
toleration support in later 2.2 kernels; is it complete enough that
I can migrate to 2.4, and still compile on 2.2?
The device:
  1-2 DMA
  1   IRQ
The driver:
  mkalloc
  __get_free_pages
  virt_to_bus
  request_irc
  wake_up
The driver has similiar functionality to a sound card:
  Send/Receive (possibly large) data to device via DMA (page fixing, etc)
Is there a cononical example (esp. wrt 2.2 <-> 2.4 changes) I should look
at ?
Thanks,
