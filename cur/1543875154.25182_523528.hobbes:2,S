yes. Every msi-x capable piece of hardware in the field will crash if it does 
any form of interrupt balancing. (okay that is not that much stuff out there... 
I know, but the patch is not that big at all - all it does is subtly add a few 
read flushes to make sure that critical changes in the msix vector tables are 
pushed out at the proper time).

I think Mitch was way too sensitive when he worded his e-mail. We should really 
be trying to get this fix into 2.6.21 at least.
Mitch, can you re-post this and include Eric Biederman, linux-pci, our intel 
platform guys and perhaps Linus and Andrew?
A lot of vendors (not just us) will be pushing msi-x capable hardware out, and 
this fix is absolutely needed. Getting it in soon is really preferred. Not to 
mention that Mitch has spent well over 8 weeks I think making sure that this is 
indeed the issue and the proper fix...
