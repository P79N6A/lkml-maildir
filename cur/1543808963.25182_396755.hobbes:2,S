It runs Debian Sarge for AMD64.  I have lots of other machines, but only
this one gets the reboots.  None of the others have SCSI, and none are
dual-CPU with memory on both nodes, just to name two obvious things
different on this machine.
And my symptoms are the same - nothing in the logs, nothing sent to the
syslog server, nothing on the serial console.  Just like a power cut.
