x86-64 system calls had a similar problem. I solved it by putting
them into a separate file with macros and including it multiple 
times with different macro definitions.
It would be quite useful to have it in a separate file: I'm still
toying with the idea to write a memory profiler to compute a better
list of slab sizes than the relatively dumb power of two default. Previously
it was trivial to change the table at boot, now it would be a bit
easier at least if it was a simple file that could be easily
rewritten.
