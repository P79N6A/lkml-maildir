But this is not how innovation works.
99% of innovation is not "think up something new" but rather "improve
upon what exists". Eg, Watt did not invent the steam engine, rather
he improved upon the Newcomen atmospheric steam engine (Watt
optimised out the use of atmosphere). The atmospheric steam engine
built upon the work of an italian who used a bowl and tube mercury to
demonstrate the fact that atmosphere exerts a pressure. etc...
Innovation is the process of building on other people's ideas.
You stated the following in another email:
"Maybe a picture would help.
Creating new software:  $$$$$$$$$$
Copying existing software:       $"
Perhaps, if you consider that innovation is a building process, not a 
'think of something completely new' process we could restate that as:
Creating new software:  		$$$$$$$$$$
Building upon existing software: 		 $
And possibly we might consider that the reason why 'creating new
software' is so high is precisely because it refuses to acknowledge
how innovation actually has worked throughout the ages, that its a
process of building new ideas on old, refining what exists to make it
better. That so much software is closed source and hence impossible
to build on adds greatly to the cost and stifles innovation even
further.
So perhaps its actually commercial software (in the sense that
commercial software is nearly always closed source) which is causing 
'cost of innovation' problems in the software industry, not open 
source software.
