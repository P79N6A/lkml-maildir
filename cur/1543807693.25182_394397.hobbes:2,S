It wasn't.  The issue is more complicated, you can have
three host drivers driving the same hardware:
* ide-generic driver
  - ISA like support
  - also works for PCI in legacy mode
* IDE PCI generic (the one Alan refers to)
  - generic IDE PCI support
  - by default doesn't grab IDs for which we have other drivers
    (can be forced by using kernel parameter)
* chipset specific driver
The most common mistake is to built-in ide-generic driver
and compile chipset specific driver as module...
To William:
CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC=n is a likely solution for your problem.
