Honestly speaking I whole-heartedly agree with you. For me also
the strive for technical excellence is what make things and
Linux in particular attractive. Moreoever, I spent all my life under
Unix, and have no desire to deal with Windows.
However, what I wanted to stress is that StarOffice (in my opinion)
is currently the single most important software which allows MIGRATION
from Windows to Linux. On example of my proverbial wife - she has 10 years
worth of work in Word and all people she communicates with require Word.
Moreover, there is no format to which even to convert Word documents to.
even if we'd like to (yes I use LaTeX myself).
As a remark, if I'm not mistaken Linux kernel does contain workarounds for
specific hardware (firmware) bugs/imperfections (correct me if I'm wrong)?
At the cost of technical purety ?
Is there a principal difference with keeping important software  working ?
Replacing any buggy piece of hardware for a Linux-compatible one is at
most $200, while replacing your life's work which happen to be in
different format just cannot be done.
But again, I actually agree with you :). And will recompile the kernel if
needed (never did it yet, so a bit scared), or edit the binary. But will
everybody do ? 
Anyway, I got too philosofical where the issue seems to be really minor.
