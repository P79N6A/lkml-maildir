The codec initialisation failed so the codec is NULL.

Boom as we dereferenced the codec.
Is there any reason why we should allow i810_probe to succeed
when there is no codec?
If not we can make i810_ac97_init fail in this case.
If so then we'll have to make sure that every dereference of
codec in this driver checks whether it's NULL.
I personally don't see a reason why we should allow it to
continue when the codec doesn't exist.  What do you guys think?
Cheers,
