Hello,
I'm trying to get a HighPoint Rocket SATA (4 port) card working with
kernel 2.4.X.  Currently it hangs just after detecting hdc (IDE cdrom).
If I append hdg=noprobe hdi=noprobe, etc the box boots fine, but the
SATA drives are no where to be found.  I'm currently using 2.4.22-ac1 to
support the onboard intel SATA which works fine. 
I'm not sure what other information you'd need to help me debug this,
but I'm willing to provide whatever is needed.
Thanks,
Dale
