Yes.  The freezer is only one part of the PM infrastructure that we have
currently and that is not very sophisticated, so to speak.
I'm all for changing this infrastructure, but in an organized way (ie. we
discuss what to do next, we do that and then we go to the next step) and in
the order that everyone will be comfortable with.
So, let's finish this thread and start over from discussing what needs to be
done, how (ie. in what order etc.) we are going to do that and who is going to
do what.  Shall we?
Greetings,
Rafael
