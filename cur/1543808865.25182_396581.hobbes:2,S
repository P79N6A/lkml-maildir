Ahh, I see.  I've never seen anyone use it in conjunction with an si 
prefix.  I also think that they use it in RFCs because at the time they 
started writing them, bytes were not always 8 bits on all machines.  
Today it is a pretty safe assumption that a byte is 8 bits, so most 
people use the two terms interchangeably ;)
As for 1000 vs 1024 powers, I personally use the general rule that B = 
bytes and is in powers of 1024, and b = bits, and is in powers of 1000.  
For some reason the telecom industry likes to talk in terms of 1000 bits 
per second, but the rest of the sane world uses bytes in even powers of 
two.  Generally it's people trying to sell you something that use powers 
of 1000 so they can make it sound bigger.  I really hate that.

I had that same thought a few weeks ago so I gave it a try.  I formatted 
a partition with UDF, put some files on it, then booted windows to see 
if it would take it.  It didn't :(

Hrm... interesting, I wonder how complete it is and what it's license 
is?  The fsck in the udftools package was never actually implemented 
unfortunately.
