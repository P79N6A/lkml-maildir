I'm really a newbie. Maybe I missed the whole point but
stay sure you don't need flex and bison to parse this.
It's _really_ simple, you need little code of little
complexity, to get something of flexible that can be
used for long time.
If you don't trust me I can write a little C library to parse
this just for provide a proof.
This isn't only simple to parse, but even simple to generate,
that's an important point.
