Subject: [PATCH] wait_task_zombie: remove ->exit_state/exit_signal checks for WNOWAIT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/24/52

The first "p->exit_state != EXIT_ZOMBIE" check doesn't make too much sense. The
exit_state was EXIT_ZOMBIE when the function was called, and another thread can
change it to EXIT_DEAD right after the check.
The second condition is not possible, detached non-traced threads were already
filtered out by eligible_child(), we didn't drop tasklist since then.
