thanks for the report - this made me review the hrtimer state engine 
logic, and bingo, it indeed has a nasty typo! Could you try the fix 
below, does it fix your problem? It might explain the crash you are 
seeing, because the typo means we'd ignore HRTIMER_STATE_PENDING state 
(which is rare but possible).
