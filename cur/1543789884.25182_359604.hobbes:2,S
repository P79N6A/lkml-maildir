I'm not sure what you're thinking here.  Instead of my asking a dozen
stupid questions, I guess I should just ask you to explain what you
have in mind more.
The function call you show above has no 'mask' argument, so I don't
know what you intend to update mems_allowed to.  Currently, a task
mems_allowed is only updated in task context, from its cpusets
mems_allowed. The task mems_allowed is updated automatically coming
into the page allocation code, if the tasks mems_generation doesn't
match its cpusets mems_generation.
