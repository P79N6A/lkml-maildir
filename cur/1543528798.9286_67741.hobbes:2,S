Yes, you can currently do this. Turning off overcommit doesn't stop COW,
but it takes away it's memory/swap advantage.

/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
overcommit_memory:
This value contains a flag that enables memory overcommitment.
When this flag is 0, the kernel checks before each malloc()
to see if there's enough memory left. If the flag is nonzero,
the system pretends there's always enough memory.
This feature can be very useful because there are a lot of
programs that malloc() huge amounts of memory "just-in-case"
and don't much of it.
Look at: mm/mmap.c::vm_enough_memory() for more information.
