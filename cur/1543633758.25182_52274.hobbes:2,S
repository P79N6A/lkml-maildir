Wrong.  Check for stack _space_ will mean that maximal depth of nested
symlinks depends on syscall.  Definitely not what you want to see.
There is a static limit (no more than 5 nested), but it must be
explicitly known to checker - deducing it from code is easy for a
human, but hopeless for anything automatic.
