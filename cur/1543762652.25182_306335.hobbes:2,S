When I started doing these cleanups I asked Steve if the form I'd chosen 
was OK with him - several styles were in use in different files (and even 
within files, so I picked one style to make consistent), and he indicated 
that the style I'd picked was OK by him. Once I get through all the files 
it'll be consistent throughout.
