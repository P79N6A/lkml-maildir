Yes.
Note that NT is highly particular about where on the disk its root partition
is, otherwise NT (or the loader) will go belly up. It is easier to install
NT first, then Linux after.

Excuse me? My configuration seems to disagree with you. to wit:
boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
default=linux
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.0.35
	label=linux
	root=/dev/hda4
	read-only
	append="bigphysarea=768 mem=96M"
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.0.32
	label=linux.old
	root=/dev/hda4
	read-only
	append="bigphysarea=768 mem=96M"
other=/dev/hda1
	label=dos
	table=/dev/hda
The "dos" entry loads the NTLOADER.
