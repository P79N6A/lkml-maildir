Please could you have the /dev/raw RAW_SETBIND ioctl require
CAP_SYS_ADMIN?
It basically allows you to create arbitrary raw block devices,
so should go under the wing of the mknod() capability.
Hopefully, 2.3 will get a CAP_MKNOD soon (Chris?) and it should
be moved under the wing of that eventually..
Matthew.
