It isn't an issue of getting a hook into the FUNCTION_PROLOGUE
(mcount() here) but rather of emulating the CALLER_ADDR[0123]
defs which map onto the gcc internal __builtin_return_address().
Doing so using the affectionately dubbed "Three Stooges Algorithm"
called out in the MIPS ABI is both complex and nondeterministic.
The entry FUNCTION_PROLOGUE hook provides a means to log the path
traveled thus far.  __builtin_return_address() gives a way to
snapshot a stub of the stack invocation. Together they provide
somewhat complimentary but useful debug information.
We could log the stack invocation progress in the latency
instrumentation itself by noting a new invocation in the
FUNCTION_PROLOGUE and unwind of the same in the currently
unused FUNCTION_EPILOGUE hook.  So we're just shadowing the
actual runtime stack in effect with a data structure which
can be traversed far more easily.
