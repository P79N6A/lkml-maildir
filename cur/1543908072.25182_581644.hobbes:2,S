By the compiler, or by the CPU?  If you're depending on volatile writes being 
visible to other CPUs, you're screwed either way, because the CPU can hold that 
data in cache as long as it wants before it writes it to memory.  When this 
finally does happen, it will happen atomically, which is all that atomic_set 
guarantees.  If you need to guarantee that the value is written to memory at a 
particular time in your execution sequence, you either have to read it from 
memory to force the compiler to store it first (and a volatile cast in 
atomic_read will suffice for this) or you have to use LOCK_PREFIX instructions 
which will invalidate remote cache lines containing the same variable.  This 
patch doesn't change either of these cases.

No, but I can reason about it and be confident that this won't break anything 
that isn't already broken.  At worst, this patch will make any existing subtly 
incorrect uses of atomic_t much more obvious and easier to track down.
