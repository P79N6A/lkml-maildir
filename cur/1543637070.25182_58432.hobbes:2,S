The big change here appears to be the move to per-device request queues.  
Somebody apparently already started to update this driver (you?) but 
obviously didn't try to compile it.  This is new territory for me, so I'll be 
moving gingerly in here for a while.
For those locks, I just removed the &'s, which seems like the right thing to 
do.   The "Controller" lock really seems to be a request queue lock.  Now I 
think I need to allocate and initialize a request queue, possibly in 
DAC960_CreateAuxiliaryStructures.  Am I getting warm?
