In reading Steve Dodd's post, among others, a few key realizations occurred, 
for me.
1) The mailing list linux-kernel *is* the change repository.
This is precisely how comp.sources.minix worked, all those years ago: if you 
followed the newsgroup you knew everything there was to know about Minix, if 
you didn't you knew nothing.
2) Only patches to unstable kernels will ever be considered for inclusion in a 
kernel.
Not unreasonable, when you think about it, but not obvious either, unless you 
read this mailing list.
3) The patch submission process is ad-hoc and informal.
Or, perhaps, it seems that way to someone who's not actually primarily focused 
on the kernel.  Over time rules of thumb have arisen such as whom not to 
flame, what format to submit patches in, which ideas are `hot' and which will 
languish.
You can predict a lot from this and a few subsidiary observations.
First: only kernel-centric patches will flourish, because only people who 
follow the group will be able to negotiate the caucus, and only people who are 
primarily focused on the kernel will bother.
Second: any kernel functionality which forms a sufficiently large and modular 
chunk will have to spin off and use its own resources, as has happened with MM 
and with ISDN.  The traffic flow in the main list will swamp anything that's 
not primarily focused on the kernel.
Third: the kernel list won't ever see a real pressing need for a CVS because 
they're comfortable with the list's use as a patch repository.
