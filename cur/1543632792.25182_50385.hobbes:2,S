It means the scsi driver has no error handling. Either a, add
appropriate error handling routines, or b, enable the option in
the scsi menu labelled "Use SCSI drivers with broken error handling [DANGEROUS]"
This is the fallout of a patch from Christoph Hellwig to make it more
obvious which drivers are still in need of attention.  This patch is
missing from Linus' tree, so things compile fine there. As there's been
little to no progress at fixing these, I'll push the same patch to Linus
in the next round, so things will break there too.
    Dave.
