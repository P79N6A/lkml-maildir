There's never yet been a difference, outside of some patches by bcrl.
But totalram_pages comes "before" any idea of page cache, so it's in
normal pages.

PAGE_SHIFT.

Very irritating: the time I've wasted on "correcting" code for the
"difference" between them!  Yet there's still plenty wrong and I've
largely given up on it.
Probably never will be a difference: but the idea was that the page
cache might use >0-order pages (unclear what happens to swap cache).
I wish they'd waited for a working implementation before introducing
the distinction; but never quite felt like deleting all trace of it.

I haven't seen your context; but "12 - PAGE_SHIFT" sounds like a
bad idea on all those architectures with PAGE_SHIFT 13 or more;
you'll be on much safer ground working with "PAGE_SHIFT - 12".
