Kernel 2.5.45, 2.5.51, 2.5.52 and 2.4.20 which I've tested.
Redhat 8.0, VIA VT8235 SB, Lacie USB2.0/1394 10GB HDD.

Sometimes I got the messages below during copying some large data. (in
kernel 2.5.45)
   drivers/usb/core/message.c: usb_sg_cancel, unlink --> -22
   drivers/usb/core/message.c: usb_sg_cancel, unlink --> -22
   drivers/usb/core/message.c: driver for bus 00:08.2 dev 2 ep 2-in
corrupted data!
If the messages were shown, it spent more longer than 20 secs.
Although it didn't show the same messages above in kernel 2.5.52, but it
copied slowly as before.
The connection of USB2.0 devices, OS and the ehci-hcd is suspect in my test.

   Intel and I seemed to get into the same situation.  :)
   BTW, do u have any solution for  following problem.
   **If two USB2.0 devices (HDD and CD-RW) are pluged into the same usb hub,
       Two situations I met as follow. ( check /proc/scsi/scsi )
        A. 2 devices are found and can be attached.
        B. 2 devices are found but only one device can be attached.
   Thanks for your response.
BR,
  Joseph
