Sounds like you can use a fair scheduler. Here is my standard blurb:
Fairsched is a hierarchical fair CPU scheduler. Processes are divided
into groups and each group receives guaranteed CPU time allocation
proportional to its weight. The standard scheduler is used to schedule
processes within a group. It can be used to divide CPU time fairly
among users or for more flexible CPU time allocation on busy compute
servers. Kernel patch, documentation and a testing utility can be
found at:
http://fairsched.sourceforge.net/
Rik van Riel also has also written one. His is less flexible but
significantly simpler, get it from:
