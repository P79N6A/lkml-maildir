What wrong here is you have to read in each NS record (and the records
for the parent
file) and modify them.  You are just doing one and expecting the server
to do the work
of unlinking just the one.  You have to do each link yourself.  I will
fix.

I have code that translates MAC to DOS, DOS to NFS, NFS to MAC, etc.  
You have to convert the
names using the tables in NWFS, file NWCREATE.C.  There are tables I use
to generate the 
MAC names from an NFS name using these tables of valid and invalid
characters for each
namespace.  I have to do it for all the server Namespaces, since Netware
can cross mount 
NWFS volumes created under Linux.
