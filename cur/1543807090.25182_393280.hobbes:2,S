The fact that you seem to sling mud at everyone that doesn't agree
with you makes that seem questionable.

It's hard to have a serious discussion with you because you just keep
parotting the same things and pointing fingers over and over.

And you never did answer my question about why cdrecord is the only app on any
OS to use devicename:scsibus,target,lun to specify the target device. Every
other tool out there, e.g. mount, fsck, tar, etc, all use the device name
exported by the OS, e.g. /dev/c0t0s0d0, /dev/hda1, /dev/nst0, etc, so why
is it necessary for cdrecord to be different?
