Subject: typo: HOSTCCFLAGS instead of HOSTCFLAGS in lib/Makefile

 In lib/Makefile in Linux 2.4.24, near the end there is:
gen_crc32table: gen_crc32table.c
         $(HOSTCC) $(HOSTCCFLAGS) -o $@ $<
                         ^^
 It should be HOSTCFLAGS, not HOSTCCFLAGS.
 There aren't any other instances of HOSTCCFLAGS in 2.4.24, or any in 2.6.1.
 please CC on replies, since I'm not subscribed.
