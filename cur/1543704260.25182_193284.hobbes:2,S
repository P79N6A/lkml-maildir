jwz's DadaDodo program <
http://www.jwz.org/dadadodo/>
 was inspired by 
Burroughs' cut ups, and it does this sort of Markov chain-based 
generation....
                                                                                
I'm not so sure that Markov chain analysis for spam filtering will work well
in practice for email, though, particularly when dealing with international
email. I don't write / read German or French well, but I can write in them
enough that a German / French speaker can figure out what I'm trying to say,
maybe. My German in particular is bad enough that it probably wouldn't fit
Markov chain models of how someone fluent in high German would write,
though. Similarly, look at some of the fractured English emails that appear
on this list. I can understand them, but a Markov model relaxed enough to
allow them will also include a lot of random spam....
later,
chris
