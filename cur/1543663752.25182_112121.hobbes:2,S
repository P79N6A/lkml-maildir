I tested on an Asus A7V8X motherboard (KT400) with a GeForce4 Ti 4200 
AGP8X. The module loads correctly, at last! It sets the apperture size 
correctly and all, but when I start XFree, I get do not get any 
graphical screen, but text mode garbage. Characters of all colors, with 
no sense at all. I had exactly the same problem in other kernels.
I played a bit with the NvAGP option on XF86Config file. According to 
the documentation, 0 is PCI mode, 1 is NvAGP or fallback to PCI if 
failed, 2 is AGPGART mode or fallback to PCI if failed, 3 is autodetect. 
If I set it to 2, 3 or comment it, I got the same problem with the 
garbage and had to reset the PC. Setting it to 0 would make it run in 
PCI mode, and it always works. I tried setting it to 1, thinking that 
maybe the documentation is wrong. X started successfully, but the card 
was in PCI mode. I read the logs to confirm it, and indeed, the NvAGP 
module fails to identify the AGP chipset and falls back to PCI.
I tried setting NvAGP to 2 again, to read the logs and see if there is 
something I could find out, but unfortunately the log had nothing but 
garbage. I tried several times with no success. The log is always garbage.
