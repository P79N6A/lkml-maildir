No, but from an application's point of view they're the same. They're
both directories unable to report the number of subdirectories they
have. So, they should be handled the same. Either with nlink==1, or
nlink==0, but I think it will be difficult to migrate to the later if a
lot of existing software implement the first one.

I agree.
