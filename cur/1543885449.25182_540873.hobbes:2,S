Subject: Re: [PATCH 1/2] Use common cpu_is_xxx() macros on AT91 and AVR32
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

> Several drivers shared between AT91 and AVR32 chips use cpu_is_xxx()
> to handle CPU-specific differences. Currently, such code needs to be
> inside #ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_AT91 because the macros don't exist on AVR32.
> 
> By defining the same macros on both AT91 and AVR32, these #ifdefs can
> be eliminated. Since the macros will evaluate to a constant value for
> CPUs that aren't supported by the current architecture, any code that
> is only needed on AT91 will be optimized away on AVR32 and vice versa.
