It's not that simple.  Including a copy of the license is a license
requirement for any redistributor, yes.
But if you, a sole copyright holder, were to distribute your program,
without any copy of the GPL, claiming "it's under the GPL", you're not
a violator.
Then, any redistributor adds a copy of any version of the GPL (because
you didn't specify a version number).  At this point, is the program
licensed by *you* only under this specific license?
Now, if you picked one of the various versions of the license, to make
things easier for redistributors, does it mean you're choosing that
particular version of the license, even though the license itself
says otherwise?

I can't say either of these, indeed.  Or rather, I can, but I wouldn't
know whether I was right ;-)
