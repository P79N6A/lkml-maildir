Hi Dimtry,
It was actually my blunder.. I noticed the change in date after 2-3 days, but 
by that time I have already sent 3-4 mails. Though I didn't checked in to 
bk directly, but probably the wrong date propogated through Greg's merges.
I am sorry for that.. I know I have created confusions for lot many others.
