| Do someone know how to add a system call for the kernel 2.4.8 ?
There are _many_ examples of adding syscalls on the web.
Try searching with www.google.com if you haven't already.
I expect that the real problem is that a patch that works for
2.4.8 won't work for 2.4.18 and vice versa, e.g., due to the
method used for defining the end/size of the syscall table.

That's very close to working.
Here's how I did it for 2.4.18, but like I said above, it won't
apply cleanly to 2.4.8.  You'll have to use just a small amount of
gray matter to fix it:
  
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/syscall_ex/
contains a howto, kernel patch, and test program.

You should modify the new syscall number to a value to is not used,
and modify your userspace program to use that new syscall number.
