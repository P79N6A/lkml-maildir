Yeah.
One -could- take linear combinations, as Peter drew in his ascii art,
but would one -want- to do that?
I imagine some future time, when users of this wonder why the API is
more complicated than seems necessary, with two factors determining
task-groups where one seems sufficient, and the answer is "the other
factor, user-id's, is just there because we needed it as an interim
mechanism, and then had to keep it, to preserve ongoing compatibility.
That's not a very persuasive justification.
