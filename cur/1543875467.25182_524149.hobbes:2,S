No, you have it backward.
It is valid to pass void* to a const void* function.
It is *not* valid to pass const void* to a void* function.
Right now __chk_user_ptr is a void* function, meaning
that all the places where it gets passed a const void*
are technically illegal -- gcc would warn about these, and
it is a (separate, as you observed) bug that sparse does not.
The patch changes __chk_user_ptr to be a const void*
function, meaning that it will be legal to pass either void*
or const void* to it.  This is the correct semantics.
