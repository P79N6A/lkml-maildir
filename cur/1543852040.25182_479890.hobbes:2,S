I'm basically an end user here (as far as the kernel is concerned), so
let me ask the basic "dumb user" question here:
How should I do my async I/O if I just want to read or write
sequentially through a file, using O_DIRECT, and letting the CPU get
some work done in the meantime?  What about more random access?
I've already concluded that I should try to keep my read and write
files on seperate disks and hopefully on seperate controllers, but I
still seem to be fighting this thing to keep it from blocking.
