HI
I have an Intergraph TDZ-310 SMP box with one PPro 200Mhz processor.
I have no problem runing 2.4.9, but trying 2.4.16+ kernels
it hard freez after:
ESR value before enabling vector: 00000004
I dont have time to test the case since it is in use 24h a day.
What shoud i try? Is it a known bug?
Banai
