Matching on uniq (and having uniq available) makes sense when you want
to perform device-specific setup and want it to work even if you
change your BT adapter. Imagne yopu have a keyboard that yoou want to
handle in a special way and after you set up your BT card gets fried
and you buy another one. When matchign on uniq your setup will not
change at all.
