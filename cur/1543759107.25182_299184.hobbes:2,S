until its fixed properly, how about this ?
+#ifdef CONFIG_PPC64
     return cur_cpu_spec[0]->cpu_features & CPU_FTR_ALTIVEC;
+#else
+    return cur_cpu_spec->cpu_features & CPU_FTR_ALTIVEC;
+#endif
Brings about an interesting conundrum with teh 2.6.x.y branch.
If fixing something properly is invasive, would we want to allow
band-aids to get things working ? This would make things more difficult
wrt Linus being able to pull the previous .y branch into his current
tree, but bitkeepers conflict resolution is really unsurpassed for
such situations in my experience.
