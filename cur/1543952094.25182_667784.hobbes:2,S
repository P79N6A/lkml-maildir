Thanks for taking a look!
bitops_{32,64}.h are getting pretty empty ;)
Both contain find_first_bit/find_first_zero_bit, i386 has them inlined,
x86_64 has an ugly define to select between small bitmaps (inlined) and
an out-of-line version. I think they should be unified much like how
find_next_bit and find_next_zero_bit work now (in x86#testing).
Both define fls64(), but i386 uses a generic one and x86_64 defines
one all by itself. The generic one is currently not suitable for
use by 64-bit archs... that can change.
x86_64 defines ARCH_HAS_FAST_MULTIPLIER, i386 not. This affects a
choice of generated code in the (generic) hweight function. It would
be nice if that could move to some other file.
x86_64 has a mysterious inline function set_bit_string, which is
only used by pci-calgary_64.c and pci-gart_64.c. Not sure what to
do with it.

Seems, indeed. You missed the "return r + 1;" ;-)

The comment rightly mentions that ffs differs in spirit from the rest
of the functions here. The type to be used here it always a 4-byte one
(int); most other functions operate on longs. I have not checked if the
explicit size is absolutely necessary, but I feel much safer with the
explicit size there.

I'll see if I can come up with something better.
