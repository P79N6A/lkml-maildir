   Wheee... zero timestamp from Cobalt box.  Artemis (correctly) drops
   this packet (due to PAWS test because a zero timestamp is "older" than
   the most recent timestamp Artemis saw from cobalt-box).  Upgrade it's
   kernel and retest :-)
BTW, I bet the platforms which "worked" to this Cobalt box
did not enable TCP timestamps for the connection.
