OK I didn't actually get around to test pre3 in life. But at least
it's nice to hear that this is apparently not my fault ;-).

That's spurious and will vanish soon. I just peplaced IDE_MAX and 
IDE_MIN with the generic min() max(), which are showing nicely where
int entities of different size are compared.
