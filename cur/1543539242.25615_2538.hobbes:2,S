I believe others have already addressed the silliness
of arguing against a common language on an international
mailing list, so I will merely point out that, in fact,
your mailer is broken in that it sends long text/plain
lines without the "format=flowed" parameter.
RFC 2646 discusses this problem of "embarrassing line
wrap":
1.  Abstract
   Interoperability problems have been observed with
   erroneous labelling of paragraph text as Text/Plain,
   and with various forms of "embarrassing line wrap." (See
   section 3.)
   Attempts to deploy new media types, such as
   Text/Enriched [RICH] and Text/HTML [HTML] have suffered
   from a lack of backwards compatibility and an often
   hostile user reaction at the receiving end.
My point is that interoperability and I18N are complex
subjects, and accusing those who desire a monolingual lkml
of "racism" should not be done without more forethought
and attention to the problem than you have apparently put
into it.  You are free to start linux-kernel-babel if you
disagree :-).
