Yes, a one-to-one correspondence between the entry and return handlers
is important. I've tried to address this by passing the same
kretprobe_instance to both the entry and return handlers.

Right, and this scenario would also occur on UPs where the kretprobe'd
function has nested calls. This has been taken care of (see below).

In case someone wants to calculate the entry and exit timestamps of a
function using kretprobes, the appropriate place for it is not the
entry and return handlers. Thats because the path from when a function
is called or from when it returns, to the point of invocation of the
entry or return handler is not O(1).
Looking at trampoline_handler(), it actually traverses a list of all
pending return instances to reach the correct return instance. So any
kind of exit timestamp must be placed just before that and passed to
the return handler via kretprobe_instance (as you just suggested).

This is what I'm trying to do with this patch. I hope I've not misread
what you meant here, but as you'll notice from the patch:
+               if (rp->entry_handler) {
+                       copy = *regs;
+                       arch_prepare_kretprobe(ri, &copy);
+                       if (rp->entry_handler(ri, &copy))
<------------ (entry-handler with ri)
+                               goto out; /* skip current kretprobe instance */
+                       *regs = copy;
+               } else {
+                       arch_prepare_kretprobe(ri, regs);
+               }
the entry handler is called with the appropriate return instance. I
haven't put any explicit "match" test here for ri. The reason is that
the correct ri would be passed to both the entry and return handlers
as trampoline_handler() explicitly matches them to the correct task.
Note that all pending return instances of a function are chained in
LIFO order. S the entry-handler which gets called last, should have
its return handler called first (in case of multiple pending return
instances).
Another cool thing here is that if the entry handler returns a
non-zero value, the current return instance is aborted altogether. So
if the entry-handler fails, no return handler gets called.
Does this address your concerns?
