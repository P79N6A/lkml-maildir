The point, if I understand it correctly, was that when rpmbuild is not
install and rpm is not building-capable not to fall back to rpm and
instead yell loudly that rpmbuild is missing.
To which some said that right now "do not fall back, ever, just
require rpmbuild" may just be the best.
I have no opinion though.
