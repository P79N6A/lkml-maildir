Subject: Need help reporting bug, no 3D accel with Matrox g400

I need help reporting a bug.
It appears that some later kernel versions
do not support 3D acceleration in some cases.
I'm getting this problem with Debain etch and Ubuntu
Dapper. I first thought it was a problem caused by
switching to xorg but Ubuntu 5.10 is fine and it uses
xorg. 
----------------------------------------------------
The 3D acceleration doesn't work with xorg using the
mga driver for a Matrox g400.
My test case is ppracer which runs dreadfully slow.
This is a Debian etch machine with Debian's 
2.6.15-1-k7 kernel.
This is what I have found so far.

[mga]
DRM for MGA broken since 2005-Aug-04.
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4797
The 3D acceleration for mga appears to still be
broken.
Where and how may I respectfully plead for this to be
fixed?
:^)
Thanks
