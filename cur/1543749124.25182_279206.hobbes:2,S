The HZ=1000 is the culprit?

Humm, that might also reduce the obviousness of the irq activity in
the audio, there are times when I can hear it very plainly while a
low level audio src is in use, like the sub-millivolt levels that come
out of my Hauppauge WinTV-GO+FM card.   I keep having to turn the
master down to almost zip in order to keep it from sounding like I
have mice chewing in the walls, but its coming from the speakers. 
Onboard AC-97 audio of course.  Crappy stuff...   Humm, 100HZ would
translate to 10 millisecond intervals.  If you had a 4 millisecond 
latency,
that would be spread over 4 of the 1000 hz interrupts.  That sounds
rather confusing to the service routine I imagine.
I'll do that just for grins & report back.
