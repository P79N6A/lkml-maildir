this sounds close, but not quite.
first, it doesn't matter what the distance between the patterns is -
8, 16, 32, 128, 512, 2048 byte distances all suffer from the same
problem. 
second, the *odd* part is that your point (2) is exactly what is *not*
happening (i had coded for that situation). that is, we end up with
pattern n *NOT* overwritten and pattern (n+1) overwritten.
finally, the fact that using an 8bit sample size eliminates the
problem seems to suggest that the DMA burst size is not it.
did i get something wrong ?
