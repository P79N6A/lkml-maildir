OK.  So with that patch, nfs_writepages() may still leave I/O pending,
uninitiated, yes?
I don't understand why NFS hasn't been BUGging as it stands at present.  It
has several end_page_writeback() calls but no set_page_writeback()s. 
end_page_writeback() or rotate_reclaimable_page() will go BUG if the page
wasn't PageWriteback().
