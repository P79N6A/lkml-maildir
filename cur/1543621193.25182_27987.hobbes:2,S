Thanks.  Do to some cut-and-paste haste, my original patch converted tabs
to spaces, so that patch won't apply.  Here is a correct version for anyone
wanting to use it.  Also, my net connnection was down this morning, so I failed
to see the other recent thread about this subject, [PATCH} 2.5.5-pre1 VESA fb.
Adding those correspondents to the cc list.
