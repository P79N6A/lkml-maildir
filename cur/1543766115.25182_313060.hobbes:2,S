+Q: What happens to devices during swsusp? They seem to be resumed
+during system suspend?
+
+A: That's correct. We need to resume them if we want to write image to
+disk. Whole sequence goes like

+
+Q: What is this 'Encrypt suspend image' for?
+
+A: First of all: it is not a replacement for dm-crypt encrypted swap.
+It cannot protect your computer while it is suspended. Instead it does
+protect from leaking sensitive data after resume from suspend.
+
+Think of the following: you suspend while an application is running
+that keeps sensitive data in memory. The application itself prevents
+the data from being swapped out. Suspend, however, must write these
+data to swap to be able to resume later on. Without suspend encryption
+your sensitive data are then stored in plaintext on disk.  This means
+that after resume your sensitive data are accessible to all
+applications having direct access to the swap device which was used
+for suspend. If you don't need swap after resume these data can remain
+on disk virtually forever. Thus it can happen that your system gets
+broken in weeks later and sensitive data which you thought were
+encrypted and protected are retrieved and stolen from the swap device.
+To prevent this situation you should use 'Encrypt suspend image'.
+
+During suspend a temporary key is created and this key is used to
+encrypt the data written to disk. When, during resume, the data was
+read back into memory the temporary key is destroyed which simply
+means that all data written to disk during suspend are then
+inaccessible so they can't be stolen later on.  The only thing that
+you must then take care of is that you call 'mkswap' for the swap
+partition used for suspend as early as possible during regular
+boot. This asserts that any temporary key from an oopsed suspend or
+from a failed or aborted resume is erased from the swap device.
+
+As a rule of thumb use encrypted swap to protect your data while your
+system is shut down or suspended. Additionally use the encrypted
+suspend image to prevent sensitive data from being stolen after
+resume.
