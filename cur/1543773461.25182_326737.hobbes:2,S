The issue I had here was that Reiser4 wasn't appearing in menuconfig for
me as I did not have ZLIB_INFLATE set, and the ZLIB_INFLATE option wasn't
appearing either (I think it's because it doesn't have a prompt). I just
followed the pattern for all other filesystems referencing ZLIB_INFLATE,
and the comment in lib/Kbuild suggests this is the proper approach:

I was getting linker errors:
| fs/built-in.o(.text+0x8f465): In function `gzip1_alloc':
| fs/reiser4/plugin/compress/compress.c:59: undefined reference to `zlib_deflate_workspacesize'

| fs/built-in.o(.text+0x8f697):fs/reiser4/plugin/compress/compress.c:184: undefined reference to `zlib_deflate'
select'ing ZLIB_DEFLATE fixed them.
Reiser4 is working for me after the two changes.
