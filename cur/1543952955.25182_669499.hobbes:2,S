No clearly I'm the one confused/on drugs.
I see it now.  I swear I checked my own freshly pulled tree and
gitweb several times...

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] file capabilities: remove cap_task_kill() (-git)
The original justification for cap_task_kill() was as follows:
	check_kill_permission() does appropriate uid equivalence checks.
	However with file capabilities it becomes possible for an
	unprivileged user to execute a file with file capabilities
	resulting in a more privileged task with the same uid.
However now that cap_task_kill() always returns 0 (permission
granted) when p->uid==current->uid, the whole hook is worthless,
and only likely to create more subtle problems in the corner cases
where it might still be called but return -EPERM.  Those cases
are basically when uids are different but euid/suid is equivalent
as per the check in check_kill_permission().
One example of a still-broken application is 'at' for non-root users.
This patch removes cap_task_kill().
