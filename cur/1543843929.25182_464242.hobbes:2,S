When comparing two different approaches to a problem, it is unreasonable
and disingenuous to try to force the onus on the proponents of one
particular approach to do all the benchmarking for both sides. Everybody
has to help try to find the correct solution.
Furthermore, Mathieu already did provide numbers, if you go back and
look.

This is getting very silly, and unnecessarily abusive. Real problems
exist on both sides of the fence, which have been discussed ad nauseam.
If you don't recall them, then go back and read the thread again. The
question is how to strike a comprimise between two different set of
problems, which Ingo and Karim actually seemed to be making progress
on towards the end of the thread.
