I assume that Linus's dissatisfaction with the GPLv3 means that this 
licensing characteristic is implied. I suppose it might be valuable to 
have an explicit declaration on this issue.
As for the rest of my message, my remarks and assumptions about how Linux 
is governed by the most restrictive clause apply to today's kernel (ie, no 
GPLv3 code at all).
I was honestly hoping that this debate wouldn't ignite until when we were 
much closer to having the real, final license. Or perhaps that it would 
ignite with the purpose of participating in the development of GPLv3. 
Neither seems to be the case, and so notwithstanding your concers about 
people merging in GPLv3 code, if the issue's not dead already, it's 
probably frozen until the real, live GPLv3 gets released.
Cheers,
Chase
