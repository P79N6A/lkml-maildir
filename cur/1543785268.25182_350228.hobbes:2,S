According to the MMC documentation, you can thoeriticaly send at most
65535 (16 bits int) blocks in one WRITE(10) CDB. This would means
sending a buffer of ~127 MB on case of writing a mode 1 data track (2048
bytes per block)...
Now, practically, it is really not safe to send more than 64 KB per CDB
(Mostly device related). And with such values, you have the following:
 - at 100 Hz  -> 64 KB * 100  = 6400 KB/s  <=> ~4.62x  DVD 
 - at 250 Hz  -> 64 KB * 250  = 16000 KB/s <=> ~11.55x DVD 
 - at 1000 Hz -> 64 KB * 1000 = 64000 KB/s <=> ~46.20x DVD
I would suggest to leave to default value of the timer frequency to 1000
Hz and to add some more comment in the Kconfig.hz file. (Patch attached)
