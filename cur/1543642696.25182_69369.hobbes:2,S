There are not. If SETLEDS fails, then there is the GETID command, which
is also allowed to fail (fails on AT (non-PS/2) keyboards, which are
still common), and it most likely also fails on your keyboard. That's
all.
If you kill the SETLEDS command, then even without a keyboard, the
keyboard will be detected, and sent commands, which will have to time
out every time.

Yes. The keyboard was assumed to be always present.

It can.

Yes, but because the BIOS often writes nonsense to these config
registers, Linux knows several southbridges and can fix the routing by
hand.

Most likely the interrupt routing is controlled by the southbridge (the
ISA bridge device). See arch/i386/pci/irq.c. Maybe it's as easy as an
entry for your southbridge is missing.

Not really. Most of them are actually documented. Namely for built-in
devices like USB controllers, because those cannot be wired differently
by different board manufacturers.

Try the southbridge instead of the northbridge. I have several of the
documents, and can send it to you if you tell me the right chip number.

Well, the emulated keyboard is a very very ugly kludge. It uses SMM and
SMI to handle the keyboard, and then pushes keystrokes into the keyboard
controller. It disables any extra keys on the keyboard, and the keyboard
LEDs. The Linux USB stack isn't too big to enable the keyboard the sane
way on those systems.

Any machine with an USB keyboard enabled in the normal way will try to
set the LEDs on a non-existing PS/2 keyboard. Which will take time.
