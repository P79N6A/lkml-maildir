Hello,
I hadded lots of trouble with my ide ZIP 250...
I was using ide-scsi under pre 2.4.21-rc1-ac3, but since 2.4.21-rc1-ac3
the ide-scsi wasn't working for my ZIP, so I tried ide-floppy, and it
was the beginning of the same problem as under the 2.5 kernels...
It seems to me the problem was that I use the "raw Zip" without
partition, which didn't trouble ide-scsi, but with ide-floppy...
I have made a primary partition, and now it seems to works perfectly
well with XFS on it ;-)
Is it really needed to have a partition table on a ZIP?
	Grégoire
