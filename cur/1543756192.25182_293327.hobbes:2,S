I'd use lilo in that case. AFAI understood it can start from any device
provided the BIOS can access the boot files. (May require a 5MB /boot 
partition if the disk is larger than the BIOS can access)

If grub parses the partition table, it will do that without any BIOS
support (except maybe for reading the raw data). So even a GPT-aware BIOS
should not change a thing.
