Yes, this patch fixes the issue for 2.6.18 too. 
Just a note, there still seems to be some inconsistency regarding the
errno returned by mkdir:
   client:# mount server:/export /mnt -o ro                         
   client:# mkdir /mnt/a/b
   mkdir: cannot create directory `/mnt/a/b': Read-only file system
   client:# find /mnt
   /mnt
   /mnt/a
   /mnt/a/b
   /mnt/a/b/c
   client:# mkdir /mnt/a/b
   mkdir: cannot create directory `/mnt/a/b': File exists
Depending on the context, mkdir returns EROFS or EEXIST - shouldn't we
get always the same errno?  Using the patch from my previous mail (or a
2.6.17 kernel), mkdir will always return EEXIST in this case. 
Thanks,
 Thomas
