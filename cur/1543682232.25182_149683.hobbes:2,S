Subject: ARP with wrong ip?

Hi,
I have a problem with ARP in this machine:
Kernel 2.4.20
1 ethernet interface with IP 192.168.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
1 loopback interface with IP 194.147.150.10 netmask 255.255.255.255
default route to 192.168.10.190
Packets are being sent to ethernet interface 192.168.10.1 with IP dst 194.147.150.10.
After receiving these packets it tries to find out the mac address of default gateway (192.168.10.190)... but it's doing it from the wrong src IP address!!
22:49:10.875002 0:b:cd:4d:82:72 ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff 0806 60: arp who-has 192.168.10.190 tell 194.147.150.10
22:49:11.867673 0:b:cd:4d:82:72 ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff 0806 60: arp who-has 192.168.10.190 tell 194.147.150.10
Is this a bug?
Regards,
Carlos Velasco
