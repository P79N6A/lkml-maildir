I have -rc6 running on a P4 for a few days, doing the test script, 
compiles, Opera and found it to be comparable to 2.4.18.

My current linux related activities in rough order of priority:
- Testing of 2.4/2.5 kernel interactivity
- Testing of Swsusp for 2.4
- Testing of Opera 7.11 emphasizing interactivity
- Research of NFS i/o errors during transfer 2.4>2.5
- Learning 2.5 series kernel debugging with kgdb - it's in the -mm tree
- Studying 2.5 series serial and ide drivers, ACPI, S3
