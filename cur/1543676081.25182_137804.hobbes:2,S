exactly, this was my idea. Since we've the same race locally even on
ext2, maybe it worth to share the fix for all the fs somehow, the
problem sounds the same. You may still need callbacks to get right the
distributed fs though. still I was just wondering if the conceptual fix
could live in the highlevel rather than replicating it in the lowlevel.

cool thanks!

btw, we can discuss this some more next month at OLS too, if we didn't
clear all the issues first.

exactly, I didn't rename it yet in 2.4 since it would provide no runtime
benefit, but it is exactly the same thing ;).

agreed.
