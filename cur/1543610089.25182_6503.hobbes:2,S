Subject: SiS630 chipsets && linux 2.4.x kernel == snails pace?

I have a few systems that use the SIS630 host bridge, the 5513 IDE bridge,
etc, etc, etc, and they are slooooooowwww under 2.4.x, whereas 2.2.19
performance seems to be fairly decent.
It does appear that support for the SiS5513 was added sometime recently,
or I've just gone blind ... But trying (2 hr make dep on 2.4.14) to get a
kernel with SiS5513 support started.
Anyway, various configs, system information, dmesg, and so forth can be
found at 
http://www.realityfailure.org/~jjasen/SiS630,
 as I'm gonna be
here for a while. :(
