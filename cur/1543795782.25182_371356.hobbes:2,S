That is the problem, waiting for Intel to do hardware magic, or even to 
decide IF they do it. Like assuming that everyone has SMP because a few 
percent of the users have dual core chips. The majority of the markey 
will have SMP someday, but ignoring the current status isn't realistic.

Love to see it, I'm only semi-convinced it can be done in a way which 
actually produces significant benefits.
