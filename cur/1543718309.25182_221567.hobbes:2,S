The idea is new to me, I have to admit it.

I'm not sure I get what you mean here.

Correct. Same as #1 and #3 then.

Correct again, like all other proposed implementations.

Correct, same as #3. Except that with #3, the time will come when both
the fan speed measurement and the low limit fit in the same divider
value, so hardware limit can be restored. The fact that your
implementation completely disables the hardware limit is a problem.
>   - Update frequency of the fan speed will be halved.
This is another serious problem, methinks. And it doesn't quite match
your requirement of "as close as possible" above. If we simply alternate
two dividers, one per update, then there's no reason the fan speed won't
have changed inbetween. In a way, this is similar to my other proposals
in that matter, except that my implementations stick to the last "good"
value once they get it, so we don't have to change the divider often if
the fan is stable.

You're right here too, that's a problem. Some chips stop measuring
anything when accessed for register reads or writes. This is the reason
why all our hardware monitoring drivers cache the read values for some
time (typically 1 to 2 seconds). So reading the fan speed twice in the
same update, after changing the divider inbetween, is not an option. It
would add a very long delay to the update operation, it's just not worth
it.

Not necessarily. If the BIOS restores an arbitrary low limit, it can
trigger. In any case, if the BIOS does this, it promises trouble, but if
we read the register value on each update and display it to the user (as
opposed to display a different one and process it in software), at least
the user will notice. This is a minor argument against your
implementation, and #3 as well.
Your proposal is very similar to #3, it seems. The idea is the same
(optimal accuracy all the time) and the problems are the same too. The
only advantage of yours is that you will get the "correct" divider value
at step 2, while it may take more than that in #3. But in the long run,
your method endlessly changes dividers while #3 stabilizes and doesn't.

This is more or less implementation #4. Granted, this is by far the most
simple implementation. However, some chips have dividers up to 128. With
such a divider, readings at relatively high speed are *really* bad. At
5000 RPM you may have a resolution no better than +/- 2370 RPM, if I'm
not mistaking. We may not care about ultimate accuracy, but still... We
could decide that, for example, "32 should be enough for everyone" but
it may not be, some people have really slow fans, or fans emitting a
single tick per rotation. Deciding of one single divider will be fine
for most cases, but just not all, so this is probably not acceptable.
These people would be losing something from manual mode we have for now.
This is the reason why #2 has my preference. It does the best it can
with the user's hardware, while still being safe with regards to
hardware low limit and nasty BIOSes. The extra code required is
reasonable (IMHO), and the clock divider changes are limited to the
minimum required.
Thanks for your proposal, however.
