I _knew_ I enabled the DMA, but it seems that is switches off when I start
the transfer:
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: ide_intr: huh? expected NULL handler on exit
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
ISO 9660 Extensions: RRIP_1991A
VFS: busy inodes on changed media.
This is on hdc, which is the DVD. Harddisk has DMA on.
