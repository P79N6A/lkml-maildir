>(A) Do not check "build aic7xxx firmware".
	I want to build everything from source and I believe that is
important to other people as well.

	On one hand, I still prefer my solution of not needing db
at all to build the aic7xxx firmware.  I believe that compatability
problems in my db configuration is a system administration bug in the
one of the db packages or both, but I haven't fully disected it yet.
	On the other hand, what you describe sounds like an
improvement over what is in the stock kernel.  So, even though I'm not
inclined to jump to it right now, I appreciate your telling me about
it.
