Well, for example you might want to msync a number of disjoint parts of the
mapping, then write them all out in one hit.
Or you may not actually _want_ to start the I/O now - you just want pdflush
to write things back in a reasonable time period, so you don't have unsynced
data floating about in memory for eight hours.  That's a quite reasonable
application of msync(MS_ASYNC).
