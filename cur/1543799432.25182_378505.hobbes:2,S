Subject: Possible Bootloader Optimization in inflate (get rid of unnecessary 32k Window)

Hello, Whom do I talk to about acceptance of Patches in the Bootloader?
I have seen, and coded once some time ago for priv. uses, do infalte the 
gziped linux kernel at boottime in "arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c" and " 
windowlib/inflate.c" the deflation algorthimn uses a 32k backtrack window. 
Whenever it is full, it copies it .... into the memory. 
While this window makes a lot of sense in an userspace application like 
gunzip, it does not make a lot sense in the bootloader. As userspace 
application the window is flushed to a file when full. The bootloader 
"flushes" it to memory (copies it in memory). That 1 time copy of the whole 
kernel can be optimized away, since we do not keep track of a window since 
the inflater can read what it has written right in the computer memory, while 
it unpacks the kernel.
What would the optimization be worth? 
* A faster uncompressing of the kernel, since a total 1-time memcopy of the 
whole kernel is been optimized away.
* I'm not sure about the size, the memory or disk footprint. If the 32k static 
(!) memory array in compressed/misc.c, I don't know if it safes 32k running 
memory, or 32k on-disk size. Since I don't know the indepth working of these.
Before I code this again (I know that this optimization has worked with a 2.4 
kernel), I want to ask, would such patch be accepted? now or once ever? who 
should I forward this?
Greetings,
Axel
