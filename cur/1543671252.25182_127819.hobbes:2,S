You could do it nowadays using dynamic binary translation, and an
absurdly simple CPU capable of accessing a large memory.  You'd need a
DIMM for the large memory, but get away with discrete logic for the
CPU if you really wanted to.
At perf board sizes using discrete logic, expect it run run quite slow :)
