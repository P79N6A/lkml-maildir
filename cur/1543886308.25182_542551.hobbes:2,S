I think I've told you a few times already that mentioning the filename
in the file is pretty braindead and not exactly helpful.
Would be good to have an automatic check for this as I'm getting a little

I don't think any kind of copyright statement or comment is appopinquate
for a file that does nothing but including an asm-generic header.  This
file should a single line, namely:
#include <asm-generic/marker.h>
