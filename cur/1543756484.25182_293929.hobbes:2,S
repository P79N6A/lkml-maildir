One possibility, perhaps, would be to have a boolean flag "sched_domain"
on each cpuset, indicating whether it was a sched domain or not.  If a
cpuset had its sched_domain flag set, then that cpusets cpus_allowed
mask would define a sched domain.

Ok - seems it should work with the above cpuset flag marking sched
domains, and a rule that _those_ cpusets so marked can't overlap.  Other
cpusets that are not so marked, and any sched_setaffinity calls, can do
whatever they want.  Trying to turn on the sched_domain flag on a cpuset
that overlapped with existing such cpuset sched_domains, or trying to
mess with the CPUs (cpus_allowed) in an existing cpuset sched_domain so
as to force it to overlap, would return an error to user space on that
write(2).
If the sysadmin didn't mark any cpusets as sched_domains, then fall back
to something automatic and useful.
Inside the kernel, we'll need someway for the cpuset code to tell the
sched code about sched_domain changes.  This might mean something like
the following.  Have the sched code provide the cpuset code a couple of
routines, one to setup and and the other to tear down sched_domains.
Both calls would take a cpumask_t argument, and return void.  The setup
call must pass a cpumask that does not overlap any existing sched
domains defined via cpusets.  The tear down call must pass a cpumask
value exactly matching a previous, still active, setup call.
So if someone made a single CPU change to an existing sched_domain
defining cpuset, the kernel cpuset code would have to call the kernel
sched code twice, first to tear down the old sched_domain, and then to
setup the new, slightly different, one.  The cpuset code would likely be
holding the single global cpuset_sem semaphore across this pair of
calls.
