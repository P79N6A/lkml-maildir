This will only work dandy if the server runs the same OS on the 
same architecture and its own system is well enough equipped to
do software installations and bootstraps. Although I'm using Linux on
my server as well as the same architecture as most of the clients
I sometimes experience troubles working in the chrooted client
environment.
