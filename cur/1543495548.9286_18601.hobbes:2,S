Subject: Missing Blacklist entry for Regal in drivers/scsi/scsi.c in 2.2.x

Hello,
after upgrading from RedHat 5.2/i386 (2.0.36) to RedHat 6.0 (2.2.5) I
noticed that I couldn´t boot with my Regal SCSI CD changer attached
when the option "probe all LUN´s" was set to YES when I compiled the
Kernel. So I had a look at drivers/scsi/scsi.c and I didn´t find the
Blacklist entry for the REGAL that was in 2.0.35 and 2.0.36 in either
the 2.2.5 that came with RH 6.0 nor in 2.2.7 and 2.2.8.
It would be really nice if this blacklist entry would be in future
2.2.x Kernels.
Bye,
Henning
