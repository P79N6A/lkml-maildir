Is this version really working well on the new Powerbooks ? From what
I've seen in this thread there are still issues and it's still a work in
progress, so it may be too early to integrate the changes in the kernel.
Also, some other comments on the code itself:
+#if defined(CONFIG_RELAYFS_FS) || defined(CONFIG_RELAYFS_FS_MODULE)                                                    
+#include <linux/relayfs_fs.h>
+#endif
While the relayfs code is ok for debugging, I'm wondering if it should be left in the final version at all.
+       int                     is0215;         /* is the device a 0x0215? */
No need for that, just use udev->descriptor.idProduct == 0x0215 (in a macro perhaps)
+       int                     overflowwarn;   /* overflow warning printed? */
I would use a static variable in the case -OVERFLOW: block here.
+               dev->xy_cur[i++] = dev->data[19];
+               dev->xy_cur[i++] = dev->data[20];
+               dev->xy_cur[i++] = dev->data[22];
+               dev->xy_cur[i++] = dev->data[23];
There is obviously a pattern here:
	for (i = 0; i < 15; i++)
		dev->xy_cur[i] = dev->data[ 19 + (i * 3) / 2 ]
I'm wondering if the same formula doesn't apply for more X and Y sensors (like 16 X
and 16 Y sensors on the old Powerbooks, 26 for the 17" models)
+#if 0
+               /* Some debug code */
+               for (i = 0; i < dev->urb->actual_length; i++) {
+                       printk("%2x,", (unsigned char)dev->data[i]);
+               }
+               printk("\n");
+#endif
Please dump that.
+               /* Prints the read values */
+               if (debug > 1) {
+                       printk("appletouch: X=");
+                       for (i = 0; i < 15; i++) {
+                               printk("%2x,", (unsigned char)dev->xy_cur[i]);
+                       }
+                       printk("  Y=");
+                       for (i = ATP_XSENSORS; i < (ATP_XSENSORS + (9 - 1)); i++) {
+                               printk("%2x,", (unsigned char)dev->xy_cur[i]);
+                       }
+                       printk("\n");
+               }
What is the point in doing this since the dbg_dump is called a few lines
later ? Best is to modify dbg_dump to know about the new number of
sensors...
+                       printk(KERN_INFO "appletouch: atp_probe found interrupt "
+                              "in endpoint: %d\n", int_in_endpointAddr);
Why is this useful to know ?
+       if (dev->is0215) {
+               dev->datalen = 64;
+       } else {
+               dev->datalen = 81;
+       }
Braces are not needed here.
PS: please inline the patch instead of attaching it to the mail, it's
much more easy to quote it that way.
