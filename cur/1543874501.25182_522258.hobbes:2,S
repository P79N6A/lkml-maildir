Ok quickly going over the code that hasn't made the list
- recvmsg not supporting MSG_TRUNC is rather weird and really ought to be
fixed one day as its useful to find out the sizeof message pending when
combined with MSG_PEEK
- RXRPC_MIN_SECURITY_LEVEL reads into rx->min_sec_level and then if it is
invalid reports an error but doesn't restore the valid level
- Why does rxrpc_writable always return 0 ?
- rxrpc_process_soft_ACKs doesn't itself limit and check acns->nAcks is
always below RXRPC_MAXACKS, as this is a stakc variable it ought to be
paranoid about it. I think its ok from the caller check but its very hard
to prove...
It needs a lot more eyes/review due to the complexity and network
exposure though - not your fault, whoever designed RXRPC's 8)
