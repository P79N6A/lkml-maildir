In  NTFS it's  illegal  IIRC.  At least  the  fs correction  utilities
complain about a block being assigned to two files.
Same with HFS+.
Sometimes  there seem to  be several  things with  the same  name. But
that's because of hidden extensions (.lnk for example).
I'm talking out of the book here, maybe the real-world implementations
of Windows  are different. I can't  tell, I only used  Windows once to
ssh into a screwed-up router.
