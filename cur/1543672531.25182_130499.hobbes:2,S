I don't see why moving up should be wrong - the ABI is {guaranteed | supposed} 
to remain backward compatible so the libc itself should be fine, and using 
the newer headers to build apps shouldn't hurt - at least I can't see any 
obvious cases (there are probably some, but at any rate I, have seen this 
work without problems a number of times, without rebuilding libc but using 
new features from the kernel, like iptables).
In any case, it doesn't change my example, just let Joe Admin rebuild glibc as 
well :-)
