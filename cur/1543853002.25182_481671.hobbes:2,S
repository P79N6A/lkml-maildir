It shortens out if the current cpu is not the first cpu of the span. But 
at that point it has already done load balancing for the cpu that is not 
the first cpu of the span!

Ok.

This would mean we would have to determine the least loaded group first.

Yes we want that. Maybe we could remember the load calculated in 
sched_group and use that for a certain time period? Load would only be 
calculated once and then all other processors make their decisions based 
on the cached load?

Right. However, if we follow this line of thought then we will be 
redesigning the load balancing logic.
