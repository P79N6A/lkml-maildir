None of this is valid.  The great majority of machines out there will
continue to have the same number of zones.  Nothing changes.
What will happen is that a small number of machines will have different
runtime behaviour.  So they don't benefit from the majority's testing and
they don't contrinute to it and they potentially have unique-to-them
problems which we need to worry about.
That's all a real cost, so we need to see *good* benefits to outweigh that
cost.  Thus far I don't think we've seen that.
