Well, yes and no.  What you really need is a conservative estimate
of how much entropy is contained in n bits of input; a cryptographic
hash, such as MD5, will distill out the "truly random".  The comments
in drivers/char/random.c claim that the input hash is cryptographically
noncritical, but to be pedantic, maybe MD5 the audio noise before
writing to /dev/random.
Assuming the sound-card output looks like reasonable noise of
a few LSBs amplitude, a conservative estimate might be 0.1 bit
of entropy per sample.  This is 9600 bits of entropy per second
from a stereo card, more than enough.
A small daemon would wake up every so often, check if /dev/random
needs topped up, read some audio samples, MD5(), write(),
ioctl(# of claimed entropy bits).  I haven't seen the i810 RNG tools,
but I guess they do something similar.
