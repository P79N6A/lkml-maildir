It certainly isn't.

You don't need to modify other programs. You just need to display the 
progress bar and block _user input_. I don't even claim to know X, but I 
would be extremely surprised if you technically can't say "don't let 
the user touch any other windows except this one." The user couldn't care 
less whether tasks are frozen or not by the kernel. What matters is that 
the user can't shoot himself in the foot while snapshotting.
Furthermore, we probably do need to do other things to ensure safety, like 
remounting filesystems read-only but again, this has nothing to do with 
snapshotting per se. What the kernel needs to worry about is (1) providing 
an atomic snapshot that is consistent and (2) resuming to that snapshot 
safely. If the _user_ loses data that was generated between snapshot + 
shutdown, it's absolutely no concern for the snapshot operation!

But you just explained how we can! We shouldn't bend over backwards for 
snapshotting just because the filesystems don't currently support 
something we need.

Don't worry, I am used to cold water :-).
