Grab display also stresses the main memory bus and bus arbitration logic
which caused problems on some older chipsets many of which handled
overlay mode fine. Equally some other older chipsets couldn't get
PCI<->PCI right but worked for main memory.
BT8x8's are very good for finding chipset problems.
