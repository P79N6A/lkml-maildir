[deletia]
These are counting semaphores, right?  If so, would this make sense?
        struct fast_semaphore *FS_create(char *ID, int initial_count);
        [FS_down/FS_up the same]
        int     FS_get_count(struct fast_semaphore *);
The FS_get_count() is less useful, but being able to pass the initial
count to the semaphore is pretty important.
