Hi Andre,
Thanks for responding.  The days of the lame OS are, I hope, numbered.  That is why I am here.  Since assembling this box and getting serious about changing to linux I have got myself 95% M$-free.  I do, however, earn a good deal of my living from stuff I produce on computer, and there are some very specialised apps I need that have not been ported and which won't run under Wine.

I knew a little about that before, and a lot more now.  Even so, I would not have thought that there would be so close a relationship between a specific zone and "/" as to account for the significantly better performance I see when running bonnie from that directory.
Can I just end with a thanks and a plea ?
The thanks is for all those on the list who have responded, on list and by private email, to my questions.  I am conscious that questions of that kind are not really what this list is for, and I came here only as a last resort.  No-one flamed me.
The plea is that you (or someone), might revise ide.txt to go into a little more detail about UDMA 100 issues, especially with regard to : specific drives and controllers - the use of CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_MODES and append=idex=ataxx.  I know from private emails from people following this thread, and from other lists and newsgroups, that this would be very welcome.
Regards,
Geoff
