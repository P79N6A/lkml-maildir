I think that we need to have device tree (or rather list) stable while
we performing system-wide state transitions, such as shutdown.
Otheriwse if device_shutdown runs simultaneously with device discovery
and new devices get added to the list we risk leaving them (and
potentially thier parents) running. I think we had something like that
before klist conversion - kobject_add was taking device_subsys.rwsem.
However there are dangers if some device goes offline on its own right
in the middle of shutdown process and bus code deadlocks... Maybe we
only need to disable adding new devices in suspend/shutdown path while
allowing removal... I am not sure.
Overall there is lack of consistent locking in suspend/shutdown area:
shutdown interface uses BKL, suspend (swsusp et all) uses pm_mutex and
C_A_D handler does not have any locking at all at the moment.
