No you're better off sending patches ;)
A lot of these have started appearing recently, which I think is due to
GCC becoming more vocal. Unfortunately many of them are false positives
caused by GCC not seeming to grok that this is ok:
void foo(int *x) { *x = 1; }
...
int x;
foo(&x);
return x;
It's a pity because it creates noise, but still it's beside the point.
New code going into the kernel should be 100% warning free, and so if
the eHEA guys had missed an error case they'd spot the warning before
they submitted it.
Doing the initialise-to-some-value "trick" means you only spot the bug
via testing.
cheers
