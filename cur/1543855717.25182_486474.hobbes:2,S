Hi Adrian
It's the second patch(x86_64: When user could have changed RIP always
force IRET (CVE-2006-0744)) that trigger this bug.
We have run crashme on a IBM server with 2 Intel dual-core CPU, a SUN
server with 2 AMD Opteron single-core CPU and a SUN server with 8 AMD
Opteron dual-core CPU.
Running crashme can trigger kernel panic on all platforms after the
second patch is applied to 2.6.16.4. And when kernel panic happens,
there's only "Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init" on
the screen.
Please let me know if you need any further information.
Thanks,
Forrest
