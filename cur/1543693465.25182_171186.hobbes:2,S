Subject: initcall ordering of driver w/respect to tty_init?

I have a tty driver, arch/v850/kernel/simcons.c, who's init function is
called via __initcall:
   int __init simcons_tty_init (void)
   {
           struct tty_driver *driver = alloc_tty_driver(1);
   ...
           err = tty_register_driver(driver);
   }
   __initcall (simcons_tty_init);
I'm getting errors because this init function is being called _before_
tty_init, and tty_kobj (which is the `parent' kobj of simcon's kobj) is
apparently not setup correctly yet when the simcons_tty_init calls
tty_register_driver.
Since there seems to be no way of ordering basic initcalls, I can see
why it's happening.  But what's the proper way to avoid this?  Other
tty drivers that call tty_register_driver also seem to get initialized
via initcalls (usually declared with module_init), so maybe this
problem exists for other drivers too.
Thanks,
-Miles
