For example. Unix bench's execl test result on x86_64 was
== just after boot without mounting any cgroup fs.==
mem_cgorup=off : Execl Throughput       43.0     3150.1      732.6
mem_cgroup=on  : Execl Throughput       43.0     2932.6      682.0
==
I believe this is worth ot be urgent.
I'm now trying performance improvement patches but it's too late.
Thanks,
