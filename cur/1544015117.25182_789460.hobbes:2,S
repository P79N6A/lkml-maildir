Thanks for confirming that the unexpected diff
is a fature of git rather than a bug.
Since I had used "git mv", I had expected everything
to show up as a move.  However, I understand that
comparing file contents over that move and other code moves
told a different 'big picture' story.
I guess using 'git mv' gave me the false expectation
that git actually tracks moves like other SCMs
and it would show up that way in the diff -- though
now that I think about it, I like the comparison
of the two endpoints that git did even better.
I guess you can make an argument either way about
how to handle moves.  One problem that both have to
deal with is that a history on the old (now missing)
file location doesn't work, and that by default
the history on the new location stops unless 
log --follow is used.  gitk doesn't use --follow
by default, and when it is added, the history
looks pretty strange.
thanks,
