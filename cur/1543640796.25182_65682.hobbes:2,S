Agree. I was worrried about the case when shm_destroy() is called while
trying to do a shm_get_stat().  But since shm_ids.sem is used to protect
almost every shm operations, so I think that removing the ipc_lockall()
totally should be safe.

Hmm...note sure about the tradeoffs either.  Having one lock per IPC ID
does make sense to me, but the cacheline bouncing should also be avoid. 
I need to re-think about this read-write lock and the ipc_ids.sems.

I like it better too.:-)
