And it is the biggest source of security problems that has ever existed.
One of the reasons the UNIX implementation (corba and others) haven't worked
real well is:
1. complexity of usage
2. nonportability (a version on SUN will tend to fail to communicate with one 
on HP)
3. security verification.
M$ hasn't had to deal with #2 (since all the world is intel ((their view)),
and obviously doesn't deal with #3. #1 is handled by not allowing people to
use it (the cause of so many "undocumented interfaces"), and instead force
the use of interfacing languages that ignore #2 and #3.
