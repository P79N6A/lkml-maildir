Ok. got time to look into this.
The answer is simple. load_balancing in the recent kernels is happening
using SCHED_SOFTIRQ and in -rt tree that happens not in the idle process
context but in the context of softirqd for SCHED_SOFTIRQ.
This breaks the dynticks load balancer and also the regular idle load balancing
too :(
Am on to fixing the problem now :)
thanks,
