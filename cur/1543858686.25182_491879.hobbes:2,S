Subject: [BUG] 2.6.19-rt14 does not compile with CONFIG_NO_HZ

Hello,
For your Information, I get the following compile error when
CONFIG_NO_HZ is NOT configured on 2.6.19.1-rt14:
------------------------------------------------------
   CC      kernel/sched.o
kernel/sched.c: In function '__schedule':
kernel/sched.c:4135: error: 'notick' undeclared (first use in this function)
kernel/sched.c:4135: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
kernel/sched.c:4135: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [kernel/sched.o] Error 1
------------------------------------------------------
For me it is not a real problem as I configured the kernel now as a
tickless system.
Attached 2 config files, 1 showing the error, and 1 that is working.
Kind Regards,
Remy Bohmer
