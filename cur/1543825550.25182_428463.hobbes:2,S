Yes, that's the key issue I think - the interface now has more inputs.

Ok, so there is no existing "classification" abstraction?  The
classification is tied to the scheduler implementation?

Ok, sounds like that problem is solved - just the classification one
remaining.

Looking forward to it.

Hmm, guess the vicar disclaimer was a good one to make.
Well maybe you'll find the attached file motivating, then.
