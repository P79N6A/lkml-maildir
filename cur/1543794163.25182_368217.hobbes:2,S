Yes, I'm pretty sure.  The datapoints are like this:
1) Existing vbetool with 2.6.14 and previous works
2) 2.6.15 w/no-COW-on-reserved makes existing vbetool fail
   immediately (of course)
3) 2.6.15 w/no-COW-on-reserved still fails with MAP_SHARED
   patched vbetool
4) 2.6.15 w/COW-on-VM_UNPAGED works with existing vbetool
5) 2.6.15 w/COW-on-VM_UNPAGED _FAILS_ with MAP_SHARED patched
   vbetool
That #5 is the key.
If we use MAP_SHARED and let vbetool modify the real BIOS data
area, resume fails.  That's convincing enough for me :)
