Please don't do this. It's gross. As long as we have
the bus number mangling, stuff can stay as it is.
When the bus number mangling goes, the old-style
entries can go as well. I'm working on a patch that
makes the old-style entries be symlinks like this:
../../pci%d/bus%d/dev%d/fn%d/config-space
That solves the problem for good, in the right way.
It allows for migration to something sane.
