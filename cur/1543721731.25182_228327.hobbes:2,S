Is this acquired knowledge, or new Netfilter policy?
How dependant are the iptables tools on the specifc kernel running?
Ie
Can I build iptables for use on 2.6.7 kernel with 2.6.6 linux-libc-headers? 
(probably)
But could I build iptables for 2.6.7 kernel with 2.4.20 linux-libc-headers? 
(probably not?)
The INSTALL file states specifically to use 
KERNEL_DIR=<<where-you-built-your-kernel>>
