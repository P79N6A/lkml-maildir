Well, I can add to this. I just tried 2.3.99-pre2 on my toshiba laptop with
the Intel PII4 IDE chipset. Everything works (seemingly) ok when it runs.
However, if I have to run fsck on the drives, they get completely screwed
up. It always finds errors in the form of "Inode ### is in use but has dtime
set\nInode ### (same one) has imagic bit set." So I fix/clear this for about
100 inodes, and then fsck check again...BAM, same errors all over again.
All this went on (me thinking it was harddrive going down in flames) until I
rebooted back to 2.2.14, where fsck's came back clean. I don't recall this
occuring on my UltraSPARC (which has been running 2.3.99-pre2 for a few days
now, and I thought I'de give it a try on the laptop), but I don't think I
have fsck'd a drive since I booted that new kernel, so who knows.
