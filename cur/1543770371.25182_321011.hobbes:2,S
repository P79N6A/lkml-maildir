I don't believe that drive is vulnerable to the traditionally
described SI issue, as it's based on  Marvell bridge IP.  If that
drive was vulnerable, so would be the drives of more than one other
large vendor.  I would bet something else is actually the root cause,
and by using smaller transfers or something you're just hiding the
race condition, not fixing a root cause.
(obviously i'd love to see a bus trace of the hang in action, but not
everyone can swap their cars for bus analyzers...)
