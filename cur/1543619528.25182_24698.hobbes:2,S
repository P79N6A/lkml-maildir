Maybe, maybe not.  When hacking on filesystems I try to produce
"viro-style" patches, which are a series of patches, each containing
a single transformation.  Each one is tested in isolation in addition to
the final product.  Extremely useful for nipping problems in the bud
sooner rather than later.
