Hmmm... read the code again :-).

I think this test in reality does something different then comment states.
For first port of PDC20262/65 this test increases secondpdc variable
(so it is 1 after test). For second port this test is true
(its PDC20262/65 && secondpdc == 1 && port == 1) so we don't test whether
2nd port (not controller!) of 1st controller is enabled.
Or I am reading it wrong?
