Unfortunately I have to back it out, it breaks the build.
In file included from net/tipc/core.h:41,
                 from net/tipc/addr.c:37:
include/linux/tipc_config.h: In function 'TLV_SET':
include/linux/tipc_config.h:306: error: implicit declaration of function 'memcpy'
include/linux/tipc_config.h:306: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function 'memcpy'
I truly think adding linux/string.h to unifdef-y along with:
#ifndef __KERNEL__
#include <string.h>
#else
 ...
#endif
in linux/string.h is a much cleaner and less error prone solution :-)
