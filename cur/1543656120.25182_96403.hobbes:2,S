As far as I can see early_serial_setup should be capable of being
used to dynamically setup a serial port at any time in the boot
process - this is certainly the case in the 2.4 kernels.
However if it is used during architecture initialization, for example,
then the serial8250_reg uart driver has not been registered and
initialized even though it is used in the early_serial_setup call.
What was wrong with the 2.4 implimentation where the registered
serial ports were saved until the serial driver was ready to use them?
