That's exactly the point.
If you allow a user to think they over-rode a trip-point
but that trip point never fires unless they enable polling mode,
then they're not going to get what they asked for.
Yes, SuSE enables polling mode by default, but that is just
distro specific "value add" that should eventually be fixed.

I actually agree with you for passively cooled embedded systems.
Indeed, that is the topic of one of my OLS papers.
However, for an off-the-shelf laptop that the vendor ships
with a specific active and passive cooling model, Linux
is not currently set up to ignore what the vendor provided
and go off on its own.  Yes, it could be done, but for
99.99% of cases, I expect it would be a mistake.

We are mis-using _TSP today, and over-riding it
is a hack on top of a bug...
_TSP is only supposed to be for the passive cooling
algorithm -- which by definition is polling based.
It is not intended to be used for active cooling at all.
That is what active trip were invented for...
