Hmmm...it looks like the information is there, but the PRI page looks
different than the one defined by the kernel. Which could make sense,
depending on whether "vendor specific" refers to the JEDEC vendor ID of
the device or the command set ID.
I'll try to ask someone from the Atmel flash group about this.
Anyway, I could of course add a fixup based on manufacturer ID and
convert the PRI information into something the kernel understands.
Would that be a better idea?
