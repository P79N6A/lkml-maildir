There's a more limiting problem, energy. Assuming that the energy to set 
one bit is the energy to reverse the spin of an electron, call that s. 
If you have each value of 128 bit address a single byte, then
    T = s * 8 * 2^128   and   T > B
where T is the total enargy to low level format the storage, and B is 
the energy to boil all the oceans of earth. That was in one of the 
physics magazines earlier this year. there just isn't enough energy 
usable to write that much data.

Not me, if you are going larger than 64 bits you have no good reason not 
to double the size, it avoids some problems by fitting in two 64 bit 
registers nicely without truncation or extension. And we will never need 
more than 128 bits so the addressing problems are solved.

I'm gradually copying backups from the 90's off DC600 tapes to CDs, 
knowing that they will require at least one more copy in my lifetime 
(hopefully).
