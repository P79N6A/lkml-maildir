That's the sunrpc van Jacobson congestion control stuff again. I'm
hoping Linus et al will agree with me to kill it off at some
point. Now that we have NFS+RPC support over TCP we should really be
doing UDP without van J. like everybody else does.
In the meantime, try either Alan Cox's 'ac' series kernels, or the
NFSv3 patches to the kernel. Both have a fix to match the NFS writing
speed to the congestion in the RPC layer.
Alan's stuff can be found in the 'alan' subdirectory on
ftp.kernel.org://pub/kernel. The NFSv3 stuff can be found on:
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/linux-2.2.8-nfsv3.dif.bz2
Note: If you choose NFSv3, you'll also have to patch your 'mount'
program using the patch in the nfsv3-mount subdirectory at the above
address.
Cheers,
  Trond
