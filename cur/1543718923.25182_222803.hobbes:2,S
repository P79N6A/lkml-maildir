I think that this would be minimal.

If that is what you want (and it's not an unreasonable desire) there is 
nothing to stop CKRM from imposing this view of the world on top but you 
shouldn't be forcing this view on others.  I.e. it's easy to consolidate 
separate grouping mechanisms to have a common grouping for all 
KernelObjects but it would be very close to impossible to try to present 
separate groupings for each KernelObject if there was only one 
underlying grouping.
