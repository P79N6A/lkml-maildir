memcpy(skb2->data - 16, skb->data - 16, 16);
This is for purely bridged packets.
IP connection tracking first gathers all fragments, before the bridged IP 
packets are sent out the packet is fragmented. However, since this 
fragmenting actually happens while the IP packet "is in the bridge code", no 
existing code makes sure the fragments' Ethernet headers are correctly 
filled. Now, AFAIK an Ethernet header has length 14 bytes, so don't ask me 
why the magic number 16 is used (Lennert got IP fragmenting fixed).
A nice comment in front of that copy is certainly needed...
