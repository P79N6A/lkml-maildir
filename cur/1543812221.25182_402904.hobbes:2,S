Considering that the old code was apparently known-broken due to not 
honoring the use_clustering flag, I would say that the more likely thing 
is that very few people use sg in the first place, and we should wait and 
see what the reaction is to actually fixing a real bug.
Doing more than page-sized transfers can be hard/impossible in virtualized 
environments, for example.
In contrast, upping the limits should be fairly easy, I assume. Same goes 
for if some driver disables clustering even though it shouldn't. No?
