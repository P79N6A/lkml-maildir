Actually, it can not be put back in C. Manipulating stack pointer from
gcc inline assembly is just undefined. Its back in C so we can edit
it, but it needs to get back to assembly before merging with Linus.

Hehe, try it.
You may not do function call at this point, because you are
overwriting your stack. See mails with Andi Kleen. This *needs* to be
in assembly.

Its there to prevent Heisenbugs.
