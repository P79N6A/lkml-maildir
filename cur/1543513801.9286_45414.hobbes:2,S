<br>In Linux kernel versions through 2.2.13, files Documentation/sysctl/fs.txt
and Documentation/proc.txt both state that /proc/sys/fs/file-nr's second
number represents the number of used file handles, when it appears to actually
indicate the number of allocated but unused file handles.&nbsp; This is
corrected in the first two hunks of the attached diff.
<p>There is a separate issue in that kernel/sysctl.c treats the variable
nr_files as if it were the address of an array of three integers, despite
nr_files being a single integer defined in fs/file_table.c (and followed
by the definitions of nr_free_files and max_files).&nbsp; The remainder
of the attached patch, messily, puts the three variables in a structure
and then separately defines max_files because it is exported to modules.&nbsp;
I've provided this for completeness, but an alternate, and probably more
appropriate, patch would be to simply put a warning line at the definition
of nr_files in fs/file_table.c:&nbsp; "CAUTION: kernel/sysctl.c depends
on the following three integers being defined in the current order".
<p>I do not subscribe to this list and would appreciate being cc'd on any
replies.&nbsp; Apologies in advance if this post is ill-advised or misaddressed.&nbsp;
I couldn't locate an entry&nbsp; in the MAINTAINERS file for sysctl or
/proc.
