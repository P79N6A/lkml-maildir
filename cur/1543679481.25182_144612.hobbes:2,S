That's the case on x86_64 yes.

I assume on 2.5 has this problem, not 2.4, right?

But a mask is not good for AMD64 because there is no guarantee 
that the bypass/iommu address is checkable using a mask
(K8 uses an memory hole for IOMMU purposes and for various
reasons the hole can be anywhere in the address space)
This means x86_64 needs an function. Also the name is quite weird and 
the issue is not really BIO  specific. How about just calling it
iommu_address() ?
