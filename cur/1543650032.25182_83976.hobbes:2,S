As a non-root user:
a. I can't do readlink() on /proc/1/exe ("ls -l /proc/1/exe")
b. I can do "cat /proc/1/maps" to see what files are mapped
That's backwards. If a user can read /proc/1/cmdline, then
they might as well be permitted to readlink() on /proc/1/exe
as well. Reading /proc/1/maps is quite another matter,
exposing more info than the (prohibited) /proc/1/fd/* does.
