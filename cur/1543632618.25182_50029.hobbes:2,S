I have confirmed with the Canadian CRTC, that we have no explicit laws or
regulations for the control of spam and that the CRTC has no plans to get
involved, even though they have the legal authority to do so.  Basically,
they gave me the go ahead to retaliate against spammers, since neither spam
nor anti-spam is regulated.
There are various procmail recipes for the control of spam.  The trick is to
create general purpose recipes that are not tied to specific
spammers/messages.  The Spambouncer is a set of recipes that will generate a
reply message to spam and I am doing something similar on my own site.  If I
receive spam, I send it back.  If everybody would do that, then it might
have some effect.
What we really need however, is active anti-spamming.  We need system that
will subscribe them to each other's mailing lists on an ongoing basis.  If
they like spam so much, then they can send it to each other.  I have started
to do this by collecting the e-mail addresses of spammers.  I then put them
in invisible mailto: links on my web site for spammer spiders to harvest.
A while ago, AOL returned all spam in batches back to the originators,
causing their servers to crash.  A spammer sued, and AOL won.
If anyone is interested in starting Yet Another Procmail Spambouncer, then
you can count me in.
Cheers,
