I don't know how other arches deal with IRQ_PENDING, but ARM (OMAP at
least) disables the IRQ on IRQ_PENDING. The problem is that by threading
the IRQ we take some control away from the low level code, which needs
to be replaced.
I'm open to potentially removing the irq disable()->enable() cycle on
IRQ_PENDING if it's only done on OMAP. My feeling is that it's in other
ARM's which would make that change more invasive, but I haven't actually
researched that.
