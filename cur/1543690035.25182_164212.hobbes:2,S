The AI scheduler is only used for _development_.
For deployment, the rules learned from the AI scheduler are converted to 
C code (or compiled directly to machine language) and used in real-time. 
  I don't expect the rules to be so complex that the C version would use 
much more CPU than the current interactive schedulers being worked on by 
Con, Ingo, and Nick.
During development, the AI scheduler would be used in real-time, and 
that would have a significant effect on the performance of the system. 
But since it's a constant, the relative interactive behavior should be 
about the same between AI and deployed versions, even though the AI 
version uses a lot more CPU time in the kernel.  That is, if the system 
works well with the AI scheduler, it'll work even BETTER with the 
compiled version.
