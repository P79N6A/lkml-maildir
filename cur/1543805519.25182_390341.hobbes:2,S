For incremental backups, it has to work out which files have been added
or removed across the whole disk; whether it stores this in temporary
files or in memory, if there's more file metadata than fits in physical
RAM, it'll be disk-bound working that out at the end no matter what you
do. And avoiding temporary files means you don't have problems with
those (growing) files landing in the backup.
(Now some of its design decisions, like the decision to represent things
like the sizes of files with a custom `infinint' class with a size of
something like 64 bytes, probably were insane. At least you can change
it at configure-time to use long longs instead, vastly reducing memory
usage to the mere 5Gb mentioned in that post...)
(Lovely feature set, shame about the memory hit.)
