It is actually subtly different (the <N> priority thing) which I always
thought was the reason why printk() is not called printf(). It is not
called cmn_err() because of different semantics, so it would cause more
headache than usefullness. So, if it can't be printf() and cmn_err() -
what is there left as a possible name? printk(), of course :)
Sorry if I sound like a depressed human - I planned to try 2 new ideas
wrt pollfd allocation this weekend and instead I am faced with a sudden
requirement to fill in TWO YEARS worth of tax return forms so I am :(

Tigran.
