One thing that I would very much like to have is the ability to create 
a new
shell with a new keyring, such that I can still see and use the old 
keyring,
but I can create new keys without modifying the old keyring, even to the
extent of masking out keys in the old keyring without modifying them for
other processes.  From my brief glance at your patch, that's not a 
feature
you have implemented.  I would also like the ability to mark a key as
unreadable except by kernel threads or processes with CAP_KEYRING.
If I can pass key "handles" of some sort over UNIX sockets, then I can
also pass an unreadable key to a daemon process which uses it to
access my files until I revoke the key.
Cheers,
