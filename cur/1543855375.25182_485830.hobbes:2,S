"acpi=noirq" and "pci=noacpi" are not reliable in IOAPIC mode --
as, by definition, they skip the processing of the ACPI interrupt itself.
On some systems this happens to work, and on some systems it doesn't --
depends on if there was an override for the SCI or if it appears as
a standard PCI interrupt.
So the bigger question is why you need these workarounds in the first place.
