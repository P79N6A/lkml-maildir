You've lost the plot somewhere Riley.
omirr == "online fs mirroring", a sort of migrational raid-a-like
whereby two filesystems could be kept in sync with one being the
canonical version and the other (possibly remote, or slow) as a
backup or similar.
It went into the kernel at about 2.1.3x and out again at about 5x,
where it became obvious that it was causing too many complications
and was better left to userspace.
