Dell D610 running FC5, works fine with -git5, locks up
 in less than a second after selecting the GRUB entry
 for -git7, with NumLock on and nothing else working,
 SysRq included, except for the power switch (no need
 to keep it down for 10 secs though - it powers off
 right away).
Since bzdiffing patch-2.6.18-git5 and -git7 shows there
 are framebuffer changes, I'm wondering whether anyone
 had already stumbled into similar issues.
Video card is an Intel i915GM.
Thanks in advance, ciao,
