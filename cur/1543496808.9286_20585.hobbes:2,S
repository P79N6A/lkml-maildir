yeah.
but what does linux do differently? I assume it reads the identification
from port 0x170... how can it fail?

'hdparm -I' gives quite random results
(now I tried with 66.666*5.5 MHz settings ;) ):
Model=BI-MTDAT3-15=3 0  & &$& &$&$& & f$f$&$&$, FwRev=5TOG7AA3,
  SerialNo=fv& & &$W 2GGW106643
Model=BI-MTDAT3-1553 0  & " " f$&&f&f$  " &$" , FwRev=5TOG7AA3,
  SerialNo=&6&d&$& W 2GGW106643
Model=BI-MTDAT3-15=3 0  &$" " &$&$" " &$&$fdf$, FwRev=5TOG7AA3,
  SerialNo=fv&d&d& W 2GGW106643
when I execute 'hdparm -I', I get EVERY time these:
kernel: hdd: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
kernel: hdd: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
for ~2% of the runs bit1 is also set:
status=0x53 { DriveReady SeekComplete Index Error }
but disk revolution is not scary status bit ;)
Don't know about 2.0 kernels, I used them last time in Jan 1998.

hdparm -I gives more ridiculous (and DIFFERENT) numbers every
time I run it...

For some reason it gives error=0x04 { DriveStatusError } ...
