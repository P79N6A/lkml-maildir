Why do people ever want a "converter"?
If you are converting your current filesystem to an _experimental_
filesystem, wouldn't you want to have a backup in case the new filesystem
had a bug in it?
Considering that such a conversion tool would be used only very rarely,
wouldn't you want to make a backup in case the conversion tool was broken?
The safest conversion is to make a backup with tar or similar, and then
restore it after a formatting the new filesystem.
Cheers, Andreas
