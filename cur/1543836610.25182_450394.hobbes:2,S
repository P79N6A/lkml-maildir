It's hard.
Perhaps we could merge it and stick a printk in there saying "if you have
the hardware for this driver, please send an email to ...".
Then when we get a few people we ask them "do you want to become an mxser
tester".
Then we add a comment to the driver (or ./TESTERS) recording the names of
the people who have volunteered to test this driver.
So next time this sort of thing happens, we know what to do.
Would such a system work?  Maybe.  Partially.  If it does, it would be
modestly useful.
