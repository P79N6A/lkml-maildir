That doesn't mean it is the right implementation. Most devices don't
need
this check so might as well have a fast path. You can at least reduce
the cost by setting a flag on devices that potentially have this problem
(or a PCI_ANY PCI_ANY quirk for platforms with it globally)

That will be fun given some laptop SMM touches config space.

Some of the Intel CPU's are very bad at lock handling so it is an issue.
Also most PCI config accesses nowdays go to onboard devices whose
behaviour may well be quite different to PCI anyway. PCI has become a
device management API.
I dislike the "Hey it sucks, lets make it suck more" approach when it
seems easy to do the job well.
