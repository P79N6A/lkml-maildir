Subject: [patch-2.4.0-test11] show_mem() to dump free pages

Hi Linus,
In arch/i386/mm/init.c:show_mem() we calculate the number of free pages
but don't printk it out. Therefore, we must either a) remove the variable
and the calculation or b) make use of it. I think b) is obviously better.
The patch below was tested under 2.4.0-test11.
Regards,
Tigran
