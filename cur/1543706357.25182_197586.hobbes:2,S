Audio on my thinkpad (snd-cs46xx) gets dramatically slowed down when I
use my wireless card. It is a pcmcia orinoco card. It appears that the
yenta socket driver uses the same interrupt as the sound card. Does
this sound familiar to anyone? This has happened for a little while,
but this started sometime in the last few months...
I just checked, and this doesn't happen with the old OSS drivers
(under the same kernel) Does anyone have any ideas?
