you have just as much standing, and you certainly went to great lengths
(writing patches, testing stuff, etc.) to address this issue - it is
just an unfortunate situation that the issue here is _not_ clear-cut at
all. It is a longstanding habit on lkml to try to solve things as
cleanly and generally as possible, but there are occasional cases where
this is just not possible.
e.g. technically it was much harder to write all the latency-fix patches
(and infrastructure around it) that are now in 2.6.11-rc2, but it was
also a much clearer issue, with clean solutions; so there was no
conflict about whether to do it and you'll reap the benefits of that in
2.6.11.
so forgive us this stubborness, it's not directed against you in person
or against any group of users, it's always directed at the problem at
hand. I think we can do the LSM thing, and if this problem comes up in
the future again, then maybe by that time there will be a better
solution. (e.g. it's quite possible that something nice will come out of
the various virtualization projects, for this problem area.)
