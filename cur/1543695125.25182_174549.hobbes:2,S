Apparently loading DRM after radeonfb is okay.  Loading radeonfb after
DRM is okay as long as the DRM is not in use.  For some cards, the fb
after the DRM would still be okay (sis, tdfx at the moment, for
example), but it isn't the case on radeon, apparently.  Other than that
there aren't any issues I know of.
I've moved the Linux DRM to old-style probing as pci.txt described,
which hopefully restores the ability of fb and drm to coexist as well as
they have in the past.  I hope some linux developers can get this all
done right so that the two can coexist better.
