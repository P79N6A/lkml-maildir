well, I can think dozens of real time applications off the top of my head that
need beter than 1ms timing resolution (think sensor fusion)  1000 clock
interrupts/sec is wasteful when what you need is 1 very precisely timed
interrupt.
why do we redesign anything?  to make it better.  TCP is not the only thing in
the system.
if you are in love with the existing system, it shouldn't be hard to make it a
config option.
