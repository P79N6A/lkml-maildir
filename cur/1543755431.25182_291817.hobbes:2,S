Hmmm, that sounds like the local APIC does not wake up the PIT
interrupt properly after sleep. Hitting the keys causes the timer
interrupt to get called, and that explains why it keeps running. But
the timer ticks are not happening as they should for some reason.
This should not happen (tm)...
I've noticed that the only machine I have with ACPI C2/C3 support
does not do anything in the C2/C3 loops, it just spins around and
consumes more power than in C1 with hlt!
That's because we currently don't have any code to enable the C2/C3
states in the southbridges on many Athlon boards. It's the same
problem on my Crusoe laptop ALi 1533 chipset.
I think we should have some ACPI code that scans the southbridges,
and sets them up with C2/C3 enable functions that can be
enabled/disabled via /sys.
Does anybody happen to have documentation for the ALi 1533, 1535
or M7101 chipset, BTW? I'd like to know how to enable the C2/C3
on it.
