Hi,
I just joined the linux-cluster list after seeing a few of the messages 
that were cross-posted to linux-kernel.

If you havn't looked at it already, you might want to try out the Spread
group communication system. 
http://www.spread.org/
It is, conceptually although not code-wise, a decendant of the Transis
work (and the Totem system from UCSB)  and is relatively widely used as a
production quality group messaging system (Some apache modules use it
along with a number of large web-clusters, a few commercial clustered
storage systems, and a lot of custom replication apps). It is not under
GPL but is open-source under a bsd-style (but not exactly the same)
license.
Like transis it has a client-server architecture (and a simpler API).

I would expect transis to definitely do better then 128k/s given tests we
ran a number of years ago, but on upto medium sized lan environments the
totem/spread protocols are generally faster with less cpu overhead. I know
Spread could get 80Mb/s a number of years ago. We recently re-ran a clean
set of benchmarks and wrote them up. You can find them at:
http://www.cnds.jhu.edu/pub/papers/cnds-2004-1.pdf
I admit some bias as I'm one of the lead developers of Spread, and we (the 
developers) have been building group messaging systems since the early 
90's -- so I may look at things a bit differently -- so I would be very 
intersted in your thoughts on how you could use GCS and whether Spread 
would be useful. 
Cheers,
Jonathan
