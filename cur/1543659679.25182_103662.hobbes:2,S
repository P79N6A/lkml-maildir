Subject: [PATCH] Re: [BUG] cardbus/hotplugging still broken in 2.5.56
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Can you test the enclosed patch. It seems to be both simple and to 
resolve the resource collisions and the "No IRQ known" problem.
I added a smal comment (and modified another) so future janitors won't 
move pci_enable above pci_assign_resource again.
If everyone is ok, I can send it to Linus for inclusion in BK (I have 
the green light of Dave Jones).
Thanks,
