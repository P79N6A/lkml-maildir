Subject: [PATCH 2/3] will_become_orphaned_pgrp: partially fix insufficient ->exit_state check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/2/84

p->exit_state != 0 doesn't mean this process is dead, it may have sub-threads.
Change the code to use "p->exit_state && thread_group_empty(p)" instead.
Without this patch, ^Z doesn't deliver SIGTSTP to the foreground process if
the main thread has exited.
However, the new check is not perfect too. There is a window when exit_notify()
drops tasklist and before release_task(). Suppose that the last (non-leader)
thread exits. This means that entire group exits, but thread_group_empty() is
not true yet.
As Eric pointed out, is_global_init() is wrong as well, but I did not dare to
do other changes.
Just for the record, has_stopped_jobs() is absolutely wrong too. But we can't
fix it now, we should first fix SIGNAL_STOP_STOPPED issues.
And. Even with this patch ^Z doesn't play well with the dead main thread. The
task is stopped correctly but do_wait(WSTOPPED) can't see it. This is another
unrelated issue, will be (hopefully) fixed separately.
