Subject: Ethernet driver tweak for error correction codes

Is it possible to use up the src, dest MAC addresses (12B) and the CRC field (4B?)
on a point-to-point full duplex Ethernet link for my own data?
I would like to implement an error correction on this, because I'm gonna build
a freespace laser link which would run just this way. And i want to use it on
foggy days too when there will be a lot of bits fallen out.
Is it possible to do it in the kernel somehow cleanly? How should I try to do it?
