Almost every function in my driver is exported (only during this
debugging phase, of course). Nevertheless, even if it wasn't, the kernel
oops output should still show the call trace (even though ksymoops
wouldn't be able to translate it to symbols), do you agree??

This driver does not write to / read from userspace, except in case of
certain IOCTLs, which are not called when the problem happens. Anyhow,
these copies_[to|from]_user are not spinlocked.

Any other hints??
If anybody needs to have a look at the code, please let me know (I don't
want to send it to the whole list, just to save BW).
