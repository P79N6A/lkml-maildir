I'm getting the following messages when I start a ppp link.  I assume
they refer to specific types of compression, and that if I include the
proper magic in /etc/modules.conf I can make ppp happy.  I can't find
where this is documented.  Could someone give me the clue, or tell me
the proper magic:

Jan 12 19:12:25 localhost pppd[262]: Serial connection established.
Jan 12 19:12:26 localhost pppd[262]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/ttyS0
