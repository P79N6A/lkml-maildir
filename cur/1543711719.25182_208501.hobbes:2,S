Running RH9 on a AMD686. Kernel 2.4.8 works fine.
I receive the follwing error when booting my new 2.6.4 kernel:
_______________________________________________________
*VFS: Cannot open root device "LABEL=/" or unknown-block(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)*
_______________________________________________________
Upon compiling the kernel I was informed that:
Root Device is (3,2)
Does that have something to do with it? Please advise the appropriate 
action to webmaster@sunshinearcade.com
I tried it with initrd as well as the above both with the same error.
Below is my grub.conf
