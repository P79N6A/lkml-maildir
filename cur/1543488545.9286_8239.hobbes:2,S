  Hi, all. Version 12 of my msr patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
Some documentation is also available here.
The patch provides user space access to Model-Specific Registers (MSRs)
and Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) via device driver interfaces.
The patch also includes a crude page colouring algorithm (off by
default) and improvements for the MTRR interface.
This is against 2.2.2+devfs. Highlights of this release:
- Added MTRRIOC_KILL_ENTRY ioctl(2)
- Trap for counter underflow in <mtrr_file_del>.
- Trap for 4 MiB aligned regions for PPro, stepping <= 7.
- Removed redundant test in arch/i386/kernel/perfmon.c
- Laid foundation for futher Cyrix fixes/cleanups
- Laid foundation for AMD support
Also, I note from my logs that I didn't send an announcement of v11 of
this patch. The changelog for that version is:
- Correction for Documentation/mtrr.txt
- Ported to kernel 2.2.2
				Regards,
					Richard....
