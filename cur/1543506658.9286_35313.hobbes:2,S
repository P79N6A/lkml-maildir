BSD uses a two-stage bootloader.  The second stage is usually a file
called "boot" in the root directory of the root partition which is
"tied" to the real-mode bootstrap by a utility program in the same way
that vmlinuz'es are tied to the lilo bootstrap via the lilo program.
This allows more flexibility because the second stage boot loader only
needs to be installed once (since it knows how to walk the filesystem
to load whatever kernel you want) HOWEVER it can't do all of the
advanced things that linux needs, like initial ramdisk loading.
