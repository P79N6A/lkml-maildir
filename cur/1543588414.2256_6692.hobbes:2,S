Then, if the FPU is fine, you have just proven that the storage
where the FPU context is saved, gets overwritten. Further, once the
initial write occurs, all subsequent fnsave/frestore operations also
encounter the same spurious write. --OR some continuously-running
floating-point has sneaked into the kernel.
