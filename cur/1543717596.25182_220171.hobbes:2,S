The only thing I was thinking of doing was to export the symbol
__kernel__NR_kexec_load.  With a little care we could probably export
the system call numbers just as easily from /proc/kallsyms.
At this point that idea seems to add no real benefit.  Except for
allowing for a user space that can more easily track syscall renumber in
the kernel, which seems to be the wrong problem to solve.
So if kexec could actually get a reserved system call number that
would be the best solution I have seen in this thread.
Andrew how close are we to a point where we can look at kexec inclusion?
