Users have also reported that this patch fixes performance problems
from web servers using sendfile(). In the case of lighttpd they
actually stopped using sendfile() for large transfers and wrote a user
space replacement where they could control readahead manually. With
this patch in place sendfile() went back to being faster than the user
space implementation.
