I understand tx_loadsz is practical TX FIFO size. 
If there is no FIFO, tx_loadsz becomes 1.
Is it wrong?
 - tx_loadsz is properly initilized in autoconfig().
 - FIFO is enabled in serial8250_clear_fifo() called from autoconfig(),
   if FIFO exist.
 - autoconfig() is called from serial8250_isa_init_ports().
 - serial8250_isa_init_ports() is called from serial8250_console_init() etc.
I can't find the problem you are pointing out.

Right, we can't know how many byte exist in the FIFO.
So this patch is waiting the FIFO becomes empty at first
by calling "wait_for_xmitr(up)".
(This is the same logic with original.)
After TX FIFO become empty, we can decide the available 
TX FIFO depth by up->tx_loadsize.
