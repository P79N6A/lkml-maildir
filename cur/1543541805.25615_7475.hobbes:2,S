	Umm... Why am I getting this image of programs duhveloped in 
assumption that system directories are world-writable? Ah, yes - that's
because the fscking lot of them _is_ duhveloped that way.

	file-is-a-stream is bloody opposite to file-is-a-P-list, damnit.
And that's what the forks are.

	I suspect that it was rather "how does one make atom's properties
persistent?" On a LISP-based system. In late 70s/early 80s. By folks who
couldn't stand UNIX and would be seriously pissed by your assumption.
Ummm... Wait-a-minute, you said that you bet? I'm sure that in the other
