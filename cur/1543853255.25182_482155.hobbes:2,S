elv_next_request() returning NULL means nothing wrt the queue being
empty.

I think you are making this way too complicated, it's actually pretty
simple: you call blk_put_queue() or blk_cleanup_queue() (same thing)
when _you_ drop your reference to the queue. That's just normal cleanup.
When a device goes away, you make sure that you know about this. I said
that SCSI clears q->queuedata, so it knows that when ->request_fn is
invoked with a NULL q->queuedata (where it stores the device pointer),
the device is not there and the request should just be flushed to
heaven.
Don't make any assumptions about when request_fn will be called or not.
That's bound to be racy anyway.
