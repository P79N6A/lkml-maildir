There's another wrinkle to this problem.  The pcmcia build pulls in
asm/pgtable.h, which needs asm/page.h --> asm/page_offset.h -->
linux/config.h before CONFIG_nG is defined.  The pcmcia Makefile sets up
the includes such that 'linux/config.h' finds the _pcmcia_ config.h file
rather than the kernel configuration file.  So, it remains undefined.
I hacked around it by doing this:

  extern __inline__ pgd_t *get_pgd_slow(void)
  {
  	pgd_t *ret = (pgd_t *)__get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL), *init;
However, it's ugly.  Any ideas for a more elegant solution?
