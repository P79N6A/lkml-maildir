The Intel (and, I assume, the AMD) hardware random generator cannot be
audited.  There is no way to tell if it is a RNG.  These days, you
don't need to be paranoid to lack trust in such devices.
Governments could easily pressure Intel or AMD in a number of ways.
Perhaps other forces could corrupt the RNG implementation.
I've heard that Intel's RNG "whitens" its output in a way that hides
failure and makes analysis difficult.  This cannot be turned off.
This doesn't add to my confidence.
Adding the putative RNG's output to the pool is a Good Thing.
Depending on it may not be.
