A paranoid application should only need to read ~500 bytes if it is
generating a long-term RSA private key, and in that case, it would do
well to use a non-blocking read, and if it can't get enough bytes, it
should prompt the user to move the mouse around or bang on the
keyboard.  /dev/random is *not* magic where you can assume that you
will always get an unlimited amount of good randomness.  Applications
who assume this are broken, and it has nothing to do with DOS attacks.
Note that even paranoid applicatons should not be using /dev/random
for session keys; again, /dev/random isn't magic, and entropy isn't
unlimited. Instead, such an application should pull 16 bytes or so,
and then use it to seed a cryptographic random number generator.
