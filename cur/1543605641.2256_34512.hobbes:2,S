This is hisax.  What version are you using ?  Maybe it's been sorted in 
the last year or so ?

OK, but I've been told by other people that there are problems and this 
is consistent with my experience of this release.

It seems odd that that the module compiles and links OK, and loads into 
a uniprocessor kernel if it's broken in any way.  Or can it be broken in 
some subtle SMP specific way ?

I've built it from the sources that shipped with RH 6.2 using the GUI 
tool to specify SMP support.  I think it's installed properly in as far 
as all three CPUs get used once its installed.  Very cute !  Roll over 
NT etc !

I can do, but I'd like to know what to do differently first.
