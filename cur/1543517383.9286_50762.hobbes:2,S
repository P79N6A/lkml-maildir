And I'm just experiencing againg a rollback segment corruption again, and it
seems there hasn't been any crash. So I suspect there is something else :-(
As you suggested, I'll try to upgrade them to a 2.2.13 compiled with a egcs.
I noticed a similarity with two sites on which I had corruption: they both
running HP servers with a HP NetRaid (amird) controller. One runs a 2.0.36
kernel, and the other a 2.2.9 kernel (RedHat 5.2 and Mandrake 6.0).
Maybe it could be something wrong with amird driver or HP NetRaid firmware ?
