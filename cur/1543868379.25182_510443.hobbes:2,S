read_lock isn't free, and I suspect we're calling this function pretty
often (every pagefault?) It'll be measurable on some workloads, on some
hardware.
It probably won't be terribly bad because each lock-taking is associated
with a clear_page().  But still, if there's any possibility of lightening
the locking up, now is the time to think about it.

It's already there, via rmap.h

Am having trouble parsing that sentence ;)
