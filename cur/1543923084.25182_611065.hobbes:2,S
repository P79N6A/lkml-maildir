Justifying anything with code with not GPL compatible licences has zero 
relevance here.
And there's value in making life harder for such modules with 
questionable legality. As an example, consider people who experienced 
crashes of "the Linux kernel" caused by some binary-only driver.
Not that uncommon e.g. with some graphics drivers.
This harms the reputation of Linux as being stable.
The solution is not to support proprietary drivers, the solution is to 
get open source replacements.

No, it's still a reason for fixing the real problem.

But this does not result in any obligation of supporting low quality 
external code that destabilizes the kernel of people using it.
If it's low quality code doing something useful - well, how many hundred 
people are on Greg's list only waiting for some driver they could write?

With your "without any replacement" you needlessly excluded the 
reasonable solution:
The solution is that someone other than the author either takes the 
existing external code or rewrites it from scratch, submits it for 
inclusion into the kernel, and maintains it there.
Let me repeat that Greg has said he has hundreds of volunteers for such 
tasks.
