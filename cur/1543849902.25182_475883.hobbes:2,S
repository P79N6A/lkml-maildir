Hi!

Thanks, looks okay to me. I guess Andi Kleen would be right person to
review it in detail?
Lack of assembly modifications is good.
I guess this should be now removed? (include/asm-i386/suspend.h)
arch_prepare_suspend(void)
{
        /* If you want to make non-PSE machine work, turn off paging
           in swsusp_arch_suspend. swsusp_pg_dir should have identity mapping, so
           it could work...  */
        if (!cpu_has_pse) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "PSE is required for swsusp.\n");
                return -EPERM;
        }

I'd do plain old return NULL; here.

Perhaps disabling PSE here can help getting some testing?
Okay, I guess I should really test this one... Seems good enough for
-mm to me, but it should preferably stay there for a _long_ time.
