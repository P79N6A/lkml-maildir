Forget it - I realised this is already supported by kbuild in a nice way.
The _shipped functionality can be used here, so the RTL8180 Makefile
now looks like this:
EXTRA_CFLAGS = -DRTL_IO_MAP
obj-m		:= rtl8180.o
rtl8180-y	+= r8180_if.o r8180_pci_init.o usercopy.o
rtl8180-y	+= priv_part.o
And the binary only .o file is named priv_part.o_shipped.
No added complexity to kbuild - but I need to document this somewhere...
