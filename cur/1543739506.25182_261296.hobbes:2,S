If a malicious module loads, you lose instantly. You cannot relaibly check
module integrity on this system anymore. E.g. the malicious module might
patch the module checker to check a signed module instead of the malicious
one. Or the Exploit saves the old module, puts in the patched one, loads it
and puts the old one back in place.
Therefore you have to check on loading the module, independent from the
program loading the module. (Or you'd have to check the program loading the
module and provide a reliable way to prevent any race condition, which
would be much harder.)
