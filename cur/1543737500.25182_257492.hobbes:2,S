Andrew, 
Nishanth's patch is a nice cleanup.
Please apply.
Germano, we should include this patch on top of
latest Linus's changes (which are on the mainline BK repository)
to start the QA testing process.

So I would say there are some good reasons to apply this patch.
Presuming this delay is somewhat long (it's a little hard to determine
this from the code, so your input here would again be appreciated),
having most drivers delay for long times using msleep*() goes a long way
towards consistency IMO. Since your timeout values are variables,
though, this becomes a little more difficult to argue :) Then again, if
we could figure out a way to use seconds (or some other human time-unit)
to express the delays, I think using msleep*() becomes pretty obvious.
Or even if it doesn't happen now for whatever reason, down the road this
makes the change that much easier

Out of curiousity, why? Would it be particularly hard to do? If that is
the case, that's fine, I'm just wondering...

To be honest, I think the arguments for using msleep() in general are
far stronger. msleep_interruptible() was recently introduced to have the
same effect except allow for a TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE based sleep. Since you
are checking for a signal after returning from schedule_timeout(),
msleep() isn't an option here ... What can be done here, actually, I
just realized is to remove the signal_pending() check, as
msleep_interruptible() does this as well.
There is another thing my patch didn't do, though - the
	current->state = TASK_RUNNING;
call is unnecessary, because schedule_timeout() / msleep_interruptible()
takes care of this.
I have made these changes in the following patch -- please revert the
previous cyclades patch and apply this one. Let me know if this is more
satisfactory (it definitely simplifies the while-loop a bit).

Description: Uses msleep_interruptible() instead of schedule_timeout().
This allows the removal of one conditional, as msleep_interruptible()
should only return non-zero if signal_pending(current) is true.
current->state also does not need to be set, as msleep_interruptible()
(actually, schedule_timeout) is guaranteed to return in TASK_RUNNING.
