Subject: Why do so many machines need "noapic"?

Some systems lock up without the noapic option. I found one
that will freeze while trying to set up the timer interrupt.
Passing 'nolapic' makes it freeze just after:
   Setting up timer through ExtINT... works
Sometimes it will boot up and then freeze during the startup
scripts. Passing the noapic option fixes all that, but it
then gets 1000 spurious interrupts per second on IRQ7 (which
only shows ehci using it.) Kernel version is 2.6.22.
