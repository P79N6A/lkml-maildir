Hmm.  Would something (untested) like the following be horribly
wrong/bad?
define archhelp
        @echo '  zImage           - Compressed kernel image (arch/sh/boot/zImage)'
	@if [ -d arch/$(ARCH)/configs/SCCS ]; then bk get -q arch/$(ARCH)/configs/;fi
# Assume board_defconfig
	for board in arch/$(ARCH)/configs/*defconfig; \
        do \
                 echo -n ' ' $$board | sed -e 's|arch/$(ARCH)/configs/||g' ; \
                 echo -n '        - Build for ' ; \
                 echo -e $$board | sed -e 's|.*_||g'; \
        done
endef
I kinda like the idea of documenting the various defconfig targets, in
make help, so maybe even adding that to the normal help section iff
arch/$(ARCH)/configs exists...  Thoughts?
