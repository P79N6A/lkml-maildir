right now.. it probably doesn't.
However I think conceptually, touching a timer before init_timer() is just
wrong. For one... it would prevent init_timer() from being able to use
memset() on the timer. Which it doesn't today but it's the kind of thing
that you don't want to prevent happening in the future.

I don't see how that is different....
