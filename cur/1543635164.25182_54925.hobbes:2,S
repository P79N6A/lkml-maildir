Perhaps, we could agree that the BKL is used wrongly if it
won't fulfill its presumed function, or fulfills another function
than the obvious without a comment stating that, or fulfills
a non obvious function without any comment ?
The first case is IMHO the worst, because, although BKL
can't hurt technically, it obscures locking.
