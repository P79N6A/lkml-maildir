<blinks> WTF does FS have to that? But anyway, the most trivial way is
to have the driver set blk_size[major][minor] to sector size and do
	fd = open("your_device_name",O_RDONLY);
	lseek(fd, 25600, 0);
	read(fd, buf, 16384);
Driver will get a sequence of requests in its queue. Requests will have
->rq_dev set to your device, ->sector from 50 to 81 and ->nr_sectors == 1
(provided that they will not get merged, indeed). It's up to the driver
to decide what to do with them. For the rest of kernel device is just a
linear array of blocks. Where/how do you get the data for block number n
is entirely up to the driver. You get to decide how to interpret these
numbers - upper layers simply do not give a damn. If you treat
req->sector==50 as "access sector with LBA==50" - that's it.
