git makes it easy to have many branches that get merged upstream, would it 
really help much if these changes were initially done as seperate branches 
and then merged in?
if so there are two ways to do this
have Ingo (and others) create a small forest of branches that get merged 
into linux-next
have Ingo (and others) create a small forest of branches that get merged 
into one 'please pull' branch that gets merged into linux-next
the second has the advantage that merge conflicts between the different 
branches will be resolved before they go upstream, and there's less work 
to be done upstream (as the upstream doesn't need to keep adding branches 
to pull)
the first may have an advantage in terms of making the different branches 
more visable.

there are always going to be cases where the problem can only be found by 
bisecting it, but I agree that there seems to be a little too much 
reliance on bisecting (but that was a heated topic a few weeks ago, let's 
not re-hash it now)
