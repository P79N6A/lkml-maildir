The stock gettimeofday doesn't just return xtime.  It uses `rdtsc' (on
Intel) to see how long it's been since the last timer tick (when xtime
was updated).  See arch/i386/kernel/time.c, grep for do_gettimeoffset.
Obviously your solution is unable to make this correction.  More's the
pity, I liked it otherwise.
