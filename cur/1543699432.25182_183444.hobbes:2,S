Can you be a bit more specific about the type of unfairness? The only
instance I clearly noticed is that one process can grow its RSS at the
expense of others if they already have a high PFF. That happens more
often in 2.4 and helps a lot with some benchmarks.
I did notice, though, that after an initial slowdown, qsbench improved
during 2.5, while the compile benchmarks got even worse.

Incidentally, all these places where rmap is used by the core VM were
introduced in 2.5.27 as well. In particular vmscan.c was completely
overhauled. But apparently you suspect subsequent changes to the core
to be a problem. I am curious what they are if that can help fixing
the slowdowns I'm seeing.
