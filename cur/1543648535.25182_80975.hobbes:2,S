The SELinux module uses almost every hook so far.  A number of companies
and distros are currently auditing this module, and it will probably be
submitted for inclusion into the main kernel tree after they are
finished.

I have a set of patches to send you today that will solve that problem,
by allowing people who do not want the hook to compile them away into
nothingness.  DaveM agrees with the proposed way of doing this.

I agree with this, and argue to mark the functions as
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() to make some people feel a bit more warm and fuzzy
that these hooks will not be co-oped for non-GPL use (this includes me.)
In short, I like Christoph's patch.
