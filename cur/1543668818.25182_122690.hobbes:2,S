It has created exceptional situations which are rather tying our hands in
other areas.

Yes, mmap() overhead due to the linear search, VMA space consumption,
additional TLB invalidations and additional faults.  The latter could be
fixed up via MAP_PREFAULT and are independent of nonlinearity.
Here's Ingo's original summary:
- really complex remappings (used by databases or virtualizing
  applications) create a *huge* amount of vmas - and vma's are per-process
  which puts a really big load on kernel memory allocations, especially on
  32-bit systems. I've seen applications that had a mapping setup that
  generated 128 *thousand* vmas per process, causing lots of problems.
- setting up separate mappings is expensive, causes one pagefault per page
  and also causes TLB flushes.
- even on 64-bit systems, when mapping really large (terabyte size) and
  really sparse files, sparse mappings can be a disadvantage - in the
  worst-case there can be as much as 1 more pagetable page allocated for
  every file page that is mapped in.

I think that's right - the system call is very specialised and is targeted at
solving problems which have been encountered in a small number of
applications, but important ones.
Right now, I do not feel that we are going to be able to come up with an
acceptably simple VM which has both nonlinear mappings and objrmap.
