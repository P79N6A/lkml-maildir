Hi,
I'm running kernel 2.2.5 on caldera openlinux. I have ip-aliases enabled
and 1 alias (eth0:1) set up, which has worked fine.
I also run ucd-snmp to retrieve traffic info for eth0 and eth0:1 (trying)
I, however, cannot pull traffic info (packets/octets/etc) for an aliased
interface.
I have tried ucd-snmp 3.3.1 and 3.6.1. 
I'm running procinfo 16, if that helps.
The ucd-snmp people says the info is pulled from /proc/net/dev. My
aliased interface is not listed under there (but is in ifconfig).
Is this an oversight in the proc programming? or is it supposed to be like
that?
In any case, how can I alleviate my problem?
Thanx,
-Cygnus
