With 2.6.22-rc3-mm1, I've got a long-running video transcoding going
on. In other windows, I'm compiling, reading email, etc. with no
noticeable problems.
If I fire up lguest and leave it sitting at a shell prompt for a
couple moments, when I return to type something at the prompt, it can
take 2-3 seconds for my input to echo. Once it starts responding,
typing latency disappears. Suspend the other app and the latency
disappears.
The system isn't swapping and has basically no I/O load.
Ok, my transcoding just finished as I was writing this. So I've
reproduced the problem with this Python script that I had handy:
memload.py:
#!/usr/bin/python
a = "a" * 16 * 1024 * 1024
while 1:
    b = a[1:] + "b"
    a = b[1:] + "c"

Mathematics is the supreme nostalgia of our time.
