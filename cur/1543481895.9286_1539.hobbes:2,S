Actually not all "winmodems" lack DSP. What all of them lack is a
processor that controls it (and responds to AT commands). So one has to
program the dsp which doesn't take that much processing power. 
You can distinguish these two kinds of modems by the label on the box -
some of them require a Pentium 100 to run, but some don't. thought both 
are marked  for Windows only.
