I guess this is possible. It is often only a single request
that is on the dispatch list though, so I don't know if it
would make sense to reorder it by priority again.

I've thought it was SOFTBARRIER ensures the device driver (and
hardware?) sees the request in this order, and HARDBARRIER ensures
it reaches stable storage in this order.
Not exactly sure why you would want a softbarrier and not a
hardbarrier. Maybe for special commands.

OK - but I'm wondering would it ever make sense to do it any
other way? I would have thought no, in which case we can document
that requests seen by 'elv_next_request', and those requeued back
into the device will not be reordered, and so Tejun does not need
to set REQ_SOFTBARRIER.
But I'm not so sure now... it isn't really that big a deal ;)
So whatever you're happy with is fine. Sorry for the nose.
