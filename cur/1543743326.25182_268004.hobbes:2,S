Great, use udev for that.

I agree, use udev.

I agree, use udev.

Fine, have them use udev.

We aren't talking about 2.4 here though.  2.4 is a totally different
subject.

You don't want to do that.  The kernel doesn't want you to do that.
Userspace doesn't want you to do that.  No one wants that.

udev will show you that /dev/ttyfoo really is /sys/class/tty/ttyD12143:
	$ udevinfo -n /dev/ttyfoo -q path
	/class/tty/ttyD12143
So you do have that "linkage".  Don't mess around with kernel names,
it's not allowed.  Mess around with userspace names, that's allowed.
