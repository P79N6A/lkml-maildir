I expect that you'll find that the ide code ends up doing
down_write(pci_bus_sem), which will enable interrupts.
(We don't know which interrupt is pending this early - that'd be
interesting to find out, but we shouldn't be enabling interrupts in there).
To whom do I have to pay how much to get this darn patch tested?
