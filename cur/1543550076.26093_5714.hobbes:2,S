I'm finally back from Linux Kongress and Linux Expo and
will look at the latest tree and integrate the fixes I
made while on the road later today (after I get some
sleep).
I have fixed this particular bug, which was caused by
us moving unfreeable pages to the inactive_dirty list
and back again, while not accomplishing anything useful.
The fix for this is trivial and I'll post it later
today (cleaned up and working in the current source
tree).
regards,
Rik
