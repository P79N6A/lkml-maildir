there are very many good reasons why this for linux is not the right
solution, including the fact that the linux tcp/ip stack already is
quite fast so the "gains" achieved aren't that stellar as the gains you
get when comparing to windows.
Also these types of solution always add quite a bit of overhead to
connection setup/teardown making it actually a *loss* for the "many
short connections" types of workloads. Now guess which things certain
benchmarks use, and guess what real world servers do :)
