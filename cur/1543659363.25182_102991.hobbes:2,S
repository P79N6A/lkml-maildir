Well, I was trying to keep my email short. Yes, if you login to a 
compromised machine, and then obtain krbv5 credentails the evil root user 
can access/delete/modify your files stored on a RPSEC_GSS NFS server.
With RPSEC_GSS, a compromised machine, on it's own (no logged in users
except evil root), can not access/delete/modify files stored on the NFS
home directory server, which is quite different than the normal case. This 
helps when the exploit-of-the-day hits at 4am Saturday morning.
As a matter of practice you shouldn't leave cached credentials lying
around when you not logged in. Unless you have a very strong reason not
to, kill your ssh-agent and run kdestory on logout (.bash_logout and 
friends).
