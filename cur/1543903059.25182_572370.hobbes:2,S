Normal memory hot-add does work as advertised. The problem in this case
is really a corner case, as I pointed out to Kamezawa-san. The only way
to enter the problematic code path (namely zone_spanned_pages_in_node())
is via free_area_init_node(), which in this case is only triggered by
hotadd_new_pgdat() if there's no existing pgdat.
Kamezawa-san wasn't able to reproduce this particular problem due to the
pgdat being preallocated, and I imagine that this is the common case for
most users. I have a slightly different use case where we might tear down
the node entirely, either to hand it off to another application, kernel,
or explicit power gating. In which case we have to start over via the new
pgdat path.

It'll be Monday before I'm by a system I can test this out on, so perhaps
someone else will beat me to it. If not, I'll give it some more testing
and follow up then.

That's probably something worth resurrecting if it's broken in current
kernels. It should be pretty trivial to hook something like that up via
sparsemem anyways.
