Don't we need to unlock the rq regardless of what fork does?
Also, the alternative would be to set preempt_count to 0 if
CONFIG_PREEMPT and 1 if CONFIG_PREEMPT && CONFIG_SMP.  I figured Linus
would balk at that sort #if/#else in do_fork.  And, even then, is it
safe to start the task with a preempt_count of 0?
