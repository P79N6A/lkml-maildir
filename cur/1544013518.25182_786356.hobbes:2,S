From a standards perspective 
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cut.html
 vs 
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/awk.html
 is probably 
a wash, but from a simplicity perspective using the tool that _isn't_ its own 
programming language is probably a win. :)
I made the change in the second round of patches I just posted.
Thanks,
Rob
