Ah.  Yes, it matters.
Running the completion in process context is nicer from an interrupt latency
point of view.  But the completion code also runs set_page_dirty(), which
takes locks which are not interrupt-safe.  Running set_page_dirty() from
interrupt context can deadlock.
So if it's convenient, yes, let's do the completion in process context.
If not convenient then we'll need to find some way of running
set_page_dirty() outside the interrupt handler.
The set_page_dirty() is there to cover the case of direct-io into a
mmapped region of another file.  We need to tell the VM that the page
has been changed, because the CPU's ptes don't know that.  And we do
have to run set_page_dirty() after the read IO has completed.
The other thing we've lost is the BIO-pruning and recycling effect: the
current direct-io code will reap BIOs while it is actually submitting
them, so the peak consumption is kept under control.  Plus there are
cache-warmness issues.  But without having a process there to do all this,
we obviously have to lose some things.
Maybe, that's not very important in real life.

Well, you're using waitqueues now - please try the fancy new ones.
As ever, profiles will tell us what's going on.
