Subject: Boot hang with ikd, 3c905 driver & serial console in 2.2.12

Hello all,
While I was trying to diagnose an unrelated problem, I seem to have stumbled
across an odd interaction with the 3c905 driver, ikd and serial console
support.
I am using the vanilla 2.2.12 with the only patch applied being
2.2.12-ikd1.gz.  I am able to boot fine with any two of the three enabled,
but with all three enabled, my boot hangs after the 3c905 driver first
announces itself, but before it prints any information about my ethernet
card, it locks.
No information is available from SysRq+anything, and the NMI oopser that I
enabled in ikd prints nothing.
It's worth noting that I don't have to have a console=ttyS1,9600 specified
to get it to hang.  merely having the serial console compiled in will cause
this.  And, as I noted above, this system boots fine with ikd+3c905 enabled,
ikd+serial console enabled, or 3c905+serial console.  Just not all three.
My system is a RH60 base, 2.2.12.  Hardware is Abit BP-6 dual 366 celeron,
128MB RAM, NCR53c875E (Tekram 390-F), 3c905b ethernet, PDC20246 ide
controller.
As no OOPS is generated, and the system is locked hard and not finished
booting, I'm unsure what other information I can gather.  I'd be happy to
provide more information if you point me in the right direction...
Thanks!
Tom
