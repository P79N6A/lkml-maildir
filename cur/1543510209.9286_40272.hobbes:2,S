I have been reading this list now for almost two years, late this evening
I ran into a situation where the current (2.2) NFS does not appear to be
working (much heavier use of NFS then origionally planned). I have been
aware of the knfsd patches and that they seem to solve many (most)
problems. I went looking and it took me 1 hour 18 min to track them down.
The problem is that this is after knowing what I was looking for and even
knowing the package name! 
I pity the newcomer who attempts to make this work.
count this as one more frustrated vote for including whatever fixes are
needed as soon as possible.
