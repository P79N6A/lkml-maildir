Doing some tests I've discovered that BPP doesn't influence this behavior 
(kernel 2.6.9-rc1 + your patch, CONFIG_FB_3DFX_ACCEL=y):
BPP   800    1600    3200    6400	<-- VYRES
8         OK       OK       OK       X
16       OK       OK       OK       X
24       OK       OK       OK       X
32       OK       OK       OK       X
The upper limit for VYRES (after a lot of tests) seems to be around 
4100/4200 (with 4100 all seems OK while with 4200 there are some 
corruptions). This is the same for all BPP.
I don't understand why I have this problem only with 
CONFIG_FB_3DFX_ACCEL=y...
