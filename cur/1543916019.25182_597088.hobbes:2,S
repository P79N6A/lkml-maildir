Sounds good, thanks.

OK, fine with me then.

I'm fine having them in the spec as long as the interface is made
generic enough.

This doesn't mean we do not want separate files. The same problem
exists for many other hardware monitoring features. For example most
thermal sensor chips have one high temperature limit per temperature
channel. However some of them have a single limit register for several
channels! The approach we have taken so far was to have individual
files, and it's up to the driver to keep them in sync.
Another example is alarm files. Some chips have a single alarm for
out-of-range voltage measurements. Others have separate alarms for low
voltage and high voltage limit crossing. In that case, we decided to
have either a single file (in0_alarm) or separate files (in0_min_alarm
and in0_max_alarm) depending on what the chip supports. Admittedly this
is not very consistent with what we did for the shared temperature
limits.

No, there's no such established precedent. This was only a suggestion
from me as it seems to make some sense. If you don't like the idea,
just ignore it.
