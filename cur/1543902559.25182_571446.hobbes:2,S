MAC-VLAN could gather this information based on it's parent
device (ie, if parent-dev has VID 7, then add VID 7 to the meta
data.  There would be no need for any driver changes I think.
Other than TCP-dump, or some other raw protocol that wants to see
the VLAN header in user-space, I can't think of what use this would
be, however.  And, if you just disable VLAN accel in the NIC (see below),
that would make this mac-vlan hackery not needed at all?

I think a better method would be to allow disabling VLAN HW accel for a 
NIC with
ethtool.  Then, the packets will be received by the software stack with 
the vlan
header intact.  Something sniffing on the physical dev will 
automatically get the
VLAN header.
Thanks,
