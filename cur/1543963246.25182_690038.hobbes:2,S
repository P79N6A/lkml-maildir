So because the bitflag can't prevent taking the same lock twice on two
different vmas in the same mm, we still can't remove the sorting, and
the global lock won't buy much other than reducing the collisions. I
can add that though.
I think it's more interesting to put a cap on the number of vmas to
min(1024,max_map_count). The sort time on an 8k array runs in constant
time. kvm runs with 127 vmas allocated...
