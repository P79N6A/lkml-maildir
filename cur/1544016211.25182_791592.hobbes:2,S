Subject: [PATCH] sys_waitid: return -EFAULT for NULL
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/13/460

It's always been invalid to call waitid() with a NULL pointer.  It was an
oversight that it was allowed (and acts like a wait4() call instead).
