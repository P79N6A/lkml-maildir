That's exactly the reason why we want only _ONE_ proper virtualized
timer device instead of 10 new variants of broken hardware.

All you need is exactly ONE paravirt clockevent device and ONE paravirt
clocksource for _ALL_ hypervisors. Cast that into stone with a
paravirt_ops->clockwahtever interface and we are all happy.

The above will give a real benefit as it is a well defined interface,
which can be verified on both ends.

As I said before: I have no objection against expanding / changing the
clockevents interface to deliver absolute expiry time, which we have
already handy.
I just refuse for a good reason to convert it from ktime_t (nanoseconds)
to an absolute cycle value. This can be done on the hypervisor side of
the paravirt clock event device. Same applies for clocksources. The ones
which need nanosecond from/to whatever conversion can do it _IN_ the
hypervisor and not in 10 different grades of madness in the kernel code.

Yes.

I understand that you want to make this as fast as possible, but TSC is
broken in more than one way and it just makes me barf, when we have yet
another way of dealing with it in the kernel.
Please keep the paravirt interface abstract and treat it in the same way
we treat the kernel - userspace API. The kernel hides all this hardware
crap away from the user space and the same applies for a sane paravirt
interface. This is also a benefit in terms of portability. 
For devices, which already live on top of an abstraction layer in the
kernel, e.g. clocksources, clockevents, interrupts, we can share one
implementation accross multiple platforms.

By the crude mechanism I'm fighting.
