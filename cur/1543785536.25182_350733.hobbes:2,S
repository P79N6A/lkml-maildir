I am not sure about that. IIRC, x86_64 has a 128-byte L1 cacheline.
So, count, fdt, fdtab, close_on_exec_init and open_fds_init would
all fit into one cache line. And close_on_exec_init will get updated
on open(). Also, most apps will not likely have more than the
default # of fds, it might not be a good idea to optimize for
that case.

Can you benchmark this on a higher end SMP/NUMA system ?
Thanks
