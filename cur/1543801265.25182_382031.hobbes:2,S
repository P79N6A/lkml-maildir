That isn't DRI. DRI is a good deal smaller than the crazy nvidia stuff.

X servers have been implemented a variety of ways involving mixed user
and kernel space environments, user space only, pure kernel space, and
even downloading the server onto a graphics coprocessor and talking X
protocol to it.
The actual performance properties are heavily dependant upon the
architecture of the cards of the period. The flavour of the past few
years is the DMA command stream which happens to lend itself well to
splitting rendering between the kernel and user space.
