Sorry if I was not clear. The problematic commit after bisecting is
a69b176df246d59626e6a9c640b44c0921fa4566. Reverting this commit and
commit edd319dc527733e61eec5bdc9ce20c94634b6482 fixes the problem. So
all other commits in the XFS merge for 2.6.25 seem to be OK. I had to
revert the second commit only to avoid a merge conflict.
And I forget to mention on my first post: Please CC me on all replies.
I'm not subscribed to the lists.
