Yes, exactly. It then causes some BUG in kfree during unroll.

Someone triggered a too large vmalloc request, that was the scenario here.

Meanwhile I thought about an even simpler solution:
__vunmap must not rely on area->nr_pages when picking the
release methode for area->pages. It may be too small when
__vmalloc_area_node failed due to lacking memory. Check
for the vmalloc address range instead.
