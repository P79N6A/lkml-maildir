Hi,

Aliases between user and kernel mappings of a page are handled by
flush_page_to_ram the old interface) or {copy,clear}_user_page,
flush_dcache_page and update_mmu_cache (new interface). Sparc64 already
uses the new interface and there are patches for ppc and ia64 to use it.
The new interface allows flushes to be avoided, leading to rather nice
performance increases.
See Documentation/cachetlb.txt for more info.
Cheers,
Anton
