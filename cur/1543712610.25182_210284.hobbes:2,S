Thanks, Matthew, for reviewing these, and the initial feedback.
I should give credit to Christoph Hellwig - he's the one who initially
recommended to me that I use a common ADT for both cpumask and nodemask,
about 4 months ago.  I will never admit in public how much time that
one line comment of his cost me ... ;-).
