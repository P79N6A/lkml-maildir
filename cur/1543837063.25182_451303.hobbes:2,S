Hi!
> This patch adds 4 new r/w sysfs attributes to the hdaps driver:
> 
> /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/sampling_rate:
>   This determines the frequency of hardware queries and input device updates.
>   Default=50.
> /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/oversampling_ratio:
>   When set to X, the embedded controller is told to do physical accelerometer
>   measurements at a rate that is X times higher than the rate at which
>   the driver reads those measurements (i.e., X*sampling_rate). This
>   reduces sample phase difference is, and useful for the running average
>   filter (see next). Default=5
> /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/running_avg_filter_order:
>   When set to X, reported readouts will be the average of the last X physical
>   accelerometer measurements. Current firmware allows 1<=X<=8. Setting to a
>   high value decreases readout fluctuations. The averaging is handled
>   by the embedded controller, so no CPU resources are used. Default=2.
> /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/fake_data_mode:
>   If set to 1, enables a test mode where the physical accelerometer readouts
>   are replaced with an incrementing counter. This is useful for checking the
>   regularity of the sampling interval and driver<->userspace communication,
>   which is useful for development and testing of the hdapd userspace daemon.

Kill the printk?
