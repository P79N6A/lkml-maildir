My favorite example of this is selinux, which you don't see unless you 
enable other unobvious things first. I say unobvious because until you 
do it the first few times you don't see the option, you ask menuconfig 
where it is, and it isn't there. So you go use your favorite tool to 
search the Kconfig until you find out why.
Now that's in part a failure of the menuconfig tool I use, which may not 
be in xconfig (I'll try that later today when I build a new kernel), but 
it seem odd that a major feature would not show unless something obscure 
were selected, and that the crypto features needed for selinux would be 
good candidates for SELECT.
Just because config is something mostly done by advanced user doesn't 
mean it should be difficult or time-consuming.
And why say "should have done" for the SCSI mess, it's correctable, if 
everyone agrees that you are right (who would dare disagree ;-) then it 
can be fixed.
