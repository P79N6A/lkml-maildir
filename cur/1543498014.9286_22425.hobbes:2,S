Wheel does not currently work with Logitech M-C48 mouse on serial port
using inputattach. It works fine otherwise.
I used
CONFIG_INPUT_SERPORT=y
CONFIG_INPUT_SERMOUSE=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEMU=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEMU_IMPS=y
and
./inputattach --mmwheel /dev/ttyS0
(--mouseman gives same result)

The keyboard focus stays on vt 1 when X switches to vt 7, unless I
press ctrl-alt-F7. I think you mentioned this one a while ago though.

AT keyboard still isn't working here without PS/2 mouse. I haven't tried
it with the M-C48 plugged into the PS/2 port yet.
It prints:

but doesn't respond to keypresses. 
USB keyboard and mouse are working fine except the mouse wheel is
backwards. Not surprising since that's not a part of boot protocol, and we
don't have an HID parser.
Also, I use matroxfb with a Matrox Millenium I, and the screen area to the
right of the penguin boot logo shows a corrupted segment of vt 1 from the
previous boot (a bunch of X stuff). It doesn't do that with plain 2.3.5.
