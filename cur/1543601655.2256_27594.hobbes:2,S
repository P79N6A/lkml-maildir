You break the locking scheme of the mm structure.
Right now the rules are
1 get a mm_struct pointer by whatever means (walk the process list and
    read task->mm, walk the mm_list)
2 increase mm_users
3 release the spinlock you acquired for 1
4 you can do with the result what you want.
With your patch applied, we would have to restrict rule 4 - at least
modifying the vma list is not possible anymore, probably further
changes.
AFAIK right now no external mm_struct user modifies the vma list, but it
could be a problem in the future.

Does that solve the latency problem? That problem is pagefaults vs.
