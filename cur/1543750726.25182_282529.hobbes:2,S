Some of these subtle bugs are only discovered a year
after the distribution with some particular kernel has
been deployed - at which point the kernel has moved on
so far that the fix the distro does might no longer
apply (even in concept) to the upstream kernel...
This is especially true when you are talking about really
big database servers and bugs that take weeks or months
to trigger.
