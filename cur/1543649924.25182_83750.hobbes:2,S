which version of loadlin does this patch?
Hans Lermen changed the gdt structure in version 1.6b to enable it to
boot a win4lin-enabled kernel - he also changed things recently (1.6c)
to boot kernels of between 0.5 &1.5Mb compressed.
(IF I sat down for half an hour I could comment better.. but you
probably know the answer straight-off anyway :-))
