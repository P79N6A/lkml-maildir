Tough. What if kswapd's memory runs out?
A more complete solution would be to assign memory reserve levels below 
which a process starts allocating synchronously. For example, normal 
processes must have >20MB to make forward progress, kswapd wants >15MB 
and the NFS server needs >10MB. Some way would be needed to express the 
dependencies.
I think more and more people will hit this problem as filesystems become 
more complex due to clustering, and migrate to userspace where it can be 
more easily managed.
