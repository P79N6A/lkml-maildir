Information:
Booting Linux-2.4.22 with mem=16M, I can still compile the
kernel as `make -j 16 bzImage` with the following resources:

After a `make clean`, this configuration normally takes
about 3 minutes to compile. With mem=16M, it takes about
12 minutes. Not too bad.
The kernel is as 'modular' as one can make it. I don't have
any built-in stuff that I don't use. This helps keep it
small. But...it is growing in size for no obvious gain.

Both of these kernels have the exact configuration and are
built with the exact same tools.
