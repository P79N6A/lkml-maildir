"AUX" is (was) a reserved "filename" in DOS.  The Linux MS-DOS
filesystem preserves (protects) that.  The extension part does not
matter; it only checks the first 8 characters of the filename.
You'll need to use a different filesystem or filename...
fs/msdos/namei.c:
		for (reserved = reserved_names; *reserved; reserved++)
			if (!strncmp(res, *reserved, 8))
				return -EINVAL;
/* MS-DOS "device special files" */
static const unsigned char *reserved_names[] = {
	"CON     ", "PRN     ", "NUL     ", "AUX     ",
	"LPT1    ", "LPT2    ", "LPT3    ", "LPT4    ",
	"COM1    ", "COM2    ", "COM3    ", "COM4    ",
	NULL
};
