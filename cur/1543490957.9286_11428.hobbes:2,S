I'd love to hear what actually happens. I'm only speculating that the
above _might_ result in problems on an unmodified 2.2.4 - but there
haven't actually been any complaints. There might be other interactions
that just make the issue never come up.
For example, when you run low on memory and do something, the non-free
buffers are under incredible pressure, so it might easily start using the
free ones quickly, and once they are in use again they will be free'd up
eventually. 
That's why I'd be interested to hear whether anybody has actually ever
seen any bad behaviour.
