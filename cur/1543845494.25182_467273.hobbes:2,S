OK, please excuse me wasting your time, it's late over here... I've
actually been looking at Linus' git tree (pulled yesterday) while
writing that mail, not 2.6.18.
2.6.18 does _not_ contain the address reversal detection.
Using the git tree instead of 2.6.18 WOL works as expected, without
having to reverse the MAC address.
