Yeah we could. But unfortunately a competence test with the inability to
write C code isn't part of the Unix spec.
You can help them enormously using the gcc extensions so gcc warns about
any unchecked set*uid call, rather than redesigning expected behaviour
to cause obscure random kills that won't even be noticed/explained.
