Well, it is a clear limitation. It hasn't mattered too much until
now, but it is one of the other issues that SGI hit (aside from
io efficiency) because they have 16K filesystems created on ia64
systems that I believe they want to access with x86-64 systems.
I'm slowly looking at patches in the background, but I'm hoping to
be able to spend a decent chunk of time working on them again soon.
It isn't trivial :)
