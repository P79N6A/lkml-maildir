Well, hrm, maybe.  If this task has one sibling thread, and that thread is
in the process of exitting then (current == next_thread(current)) may
become true before that sibling thread has had a chance to dump its process
accounting info into the signal structure.
If that dumping happens prior to the __detach_pid() call then things are
probably OK (modulo memory ordering issues).  Otherwise there's a little
window where the accounting will go wrong.
Have you audited that code to ensure that the desired sequencing occurs in
all cases and that the appropriate barriers are in place?
It all looks a bit fast-and-loose.  If there are significant performance
benefits and these issues are loudly commented (they aren't at present)
then maybe-OK, I guess.
