Hello,
currently I am writing a patch to be able to make TLBs on any IO-devices 
coherent to the CPUs TLBs. So I was looking in the kernel-sources for places 
where not only the local but all TLBs are flushed. So I came up with 
flush_map() in the arch/i386/mm/ and the arch/x86_64/mm/ directories.
Now my questions:
1. In the x86_64 part of code the flush_kernel_map() does a 
local_flush_tlb_one() but in the i386 parts a local_flush_tlb_all(). Is the 
mentioned athlon bug the cause or can it be changed to work as in the x86_64 
code?
2. Can the flush_map() function be replaced by a flush_tlb_all() respective 
flush_tlb_page(). If I can do so, what would be the correct value for the 
first argument 'vma'?
If it is not posible could you please tell me why not...?
Thank you very much!
