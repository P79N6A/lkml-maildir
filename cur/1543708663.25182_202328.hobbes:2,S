On a related matter,
I compile my kernels for 486 but buils system aligns
functions and labels to 16 bytes, with results like this:
00000730 <islpci_eth_tx_timeout>:
     730:       55                      push   %ebp
     731:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
     733:       8b 45 08                mov    0x8(%ebp),%eax
     736:       8b 40 64                mov    0x64(%eax),%eax
     739:       05 14 03 00 00          add    $0x314,%eax
     73e:       ff 40 14                incl   0x14(%eax)
     741:       5d                      pop    %ebp
     742:       c3                      ret
     743:       90                      nop
     744:       90                      nop
     745:       90                      nop
     746:       90                      nop
     747:       90                      nop
     748:       90                      nop
     749:       90                      nop
     74a:       90                      nop
     74b:       90                      nop
     74c:       90                      nop
     74d:       90                      nop
     74e:       90                      nop
     74f:       90                      nop
Losing on average 15/2 bytes to alignment, my kernel lose
# echo $((`cat System.map | grep '0 ' | wc -l`*15/2))
149632
bytes only due to function alignment, not counting jump target
alighment.
Is there any way to prevent this?
