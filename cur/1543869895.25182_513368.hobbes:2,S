And what do the SMT and Multi-Core scheduling options in the kernel
config are for ?  Because of this thread I re-read the help text, and
it looks like on could de-select the SMT scheduler option, get a
working SMP system, and see what difference ? I suppose its related
to migration and cache flushing and so on, but where could I get
more details ?
And more strange, what is the difference between multi-core and
normal SMP configs ?

I don't know myqsl internals, but you assume one thread per query.
If its more like Apache, one long living thread for several connections ?
Its the same to answer 4+4 queries than 8 at half the speed, isn't it ?
