     Well, I know that the bios on the HP Omnibook 5700 doesn't support
     e801 (it says it does, but e801 only returns 10mb on my 128mb home
     machine) and that the bios on the FIC 601(V?) motherboard doesn't
     either.
     Apparently e820 is the recommended Windows way of detecting memory,
     because you can map around memory holes with it.  And since nobody
     in the computing world gives a damn about backwards compatability
     unless it's forced on them at gunpoint, e801 becomes simply an
     inconvenient entry point which you can either ignore or return
     garbage in.

                    \/       detect scheme detects is, umm, eye-opening.
