CRC not!
The IP checksum is not the CRC. Some new network boards "know" about
the IP checksum and can compute it. The CRC is a hardware-computed CRC
that is appended to every Ethernet packet. The CRC must be received
intact or the packet is rejected (dropped). If it's possible to 'tell'
your board to exclude the CRC, this is not what you want.
If you already know this, then the possible problem is that the
packet length is wrong. The IP checksum is a 16-bit integer of
16-bit integers. This means that the packet length must be an even
number. Your driver may be returning the wrong length. Also, when
you transmit, if the hardware is going to do the checksum, what
does it expect at the checksum offset in the IP packet? Hardware
checksums usually don't 'skip' some offset so the checksum value
should probably be 0 when it goes to your hardware.
