Current News
Goldmark Industries, Inc. (GDKI - News), a rising Urban Entertainment force, is pleased to announce that the Company has enhanced its Executive Leadership with the addition of accomplished artist, Frost, as Vice President of the Music Division. Frost is very well respected by already established act and is looked at as a role model by up and coming talent. He was the pioneer of Latin Hip Hop, which has exploded, with the extremely popular, Regaetton over the past 4 years. Frost will serve as an ideal Vice President of Music Operations within Goldmark, due to his extensive musical knowledge, skills, history and experience. His presence on the Board of Executives will only serve to be advantageous to Goldmark's overall growth.
Frost -- originally known as Kid Frost -- was a pioneer in the field of Latin hip-hop, cutting some of its very first records and helping to bring exposure to other bilingual MCs. Pioneering Latino rapper Frost only gets better with age. The veteran East Los Angeles rapper, who became a hip-hop icon in 1990 with his groundbreaking single "La Raza" has stepped up his game in the last decade, sharpening his lyrical skills and becoming an authority figure in the rap world. His success allowed such Latino rappers as Cypress Hill, Fat Joe, Big Pun to make substantial hip-hop inroads.
His music features a hard-hitting mix of hard-core hip-hop, smoothed out cuts for the ladies and laid-back songs for cruising. This versatility is one of Frost's strengths, something that keeps him fresh. "The thing keeps my name in people's mouths is that I keep reinventing myself," Frost explains. "I don't just keep on making the same music I want to take bilingual hip-hop a trend I was the forefront of one step further while still kicking vivid rhymes about the code of the streets with authenticity."
Frost is an original and knows about originality. Rapping since 1980 Frost scored his first record deal with Electrobeat Records thanks to the help of his long time mentor and frieend Ice-T. When deciding on his name, Frost decided to model his moniker after that of the man who helped start his career, choosing Frost since Frost comes before ice. Then known as Kid Frost, Frost became a regular on the car show circuit in the mid 1980's. When he released "La Raza" and his debut album, "Hispanic Causing Panic" a few years later, his visibility exploded and helped the Lowrider culture thrive in Southern California and eventually Worldwide.
Frost says, "As I see the KRS-Ones and the LL Cool J's still in it, I won't budge. A lot of people might say that I'm too old. But I don't think it's your age or how you rap. It's your rap skills that keep you in the game. As long as we make that knocking Chevy music, we're going to stay in this rap game."
Frost is a more than welcome addition to Goldmark's Board of Executives.
This is one decision that is easy as it is profitable
-----------------------
A tree does not move unless there is wind.   You never miss the water till the well runs dry. Rough as a cob. Your all washed up. Raking in the dough. Tastes like chicken.   Which came first, the chicken or the egg. Spring to mind.   Shit end of the stick. Water under the bridge. As uneasy as a cat near water.   Pull it up by the roots. Stop and smell the roses. That's water under the bridge. Spring forward fall back. When it rains it pours.   Sick as a dog.   Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. Survival of the fittest.   Timber! Sweet as honey.   Survival of the fittest.   Raking it in.  Plain as water.
Welcome to my garden.  The squeaky wheel gets the grease.   Shall I compare thee to a summer's day. To live from hand to mouth. Play a harp before a cow. Your in hot water. Still water runs dirty and deep.   What's good for the goose is good for the gander. That's a whole new can of worms.   Still waters run deep. A stepping stone to. Plain as water. Stone cold sober.   A thing of beauty is a joy forever.   Through the grapevine.   Seed money. Sick as a dog.   Weed out. Take time to smell the roses. The stronger the breeze the stronger the trees. What on earth? When we love - we grow.  Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. A thing of beauty is a joy forever.   You never miss the water till the well runs dry.
