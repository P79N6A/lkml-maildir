Which is not a problem with the (b) variant where the bootloader
provided command line replaces the compiled in one. It does not change
your habit of not setting up a commandline - or an empty one. 
This would also ensure compability with grub and friends, which I
consider as a real strong argument to avoid breakage all over the place.
