Applied, and I'll queue this up for -stable too.
Please, when mentioning specific commits please also provide
the changelog headline along with the SHA1 hash.
The reason is that when this fix is moved over to another
tree where the SHA1 of the causing change is different people
studying your fix won't be able to find it without more stable
contextual information.
Thanks.
