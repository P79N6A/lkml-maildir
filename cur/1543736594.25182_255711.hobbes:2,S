but I don't need to, so I'd leave it disabled instead.
I'd also really leave the two things separated. There's no reason the
user should ever know the cryptoswap password. it only needs to know the
suspend/resume password. This way the cryptoswap password can be
choosen very big randomly and in turn with a lot more random bits than
what an user could remember by memory.
So you should only consider asking a "preventive" suspend password,
never the cryptoswap password, the latter will be transparent to the
user. suspend will automatically store safely the cryptoswap password on
disk, so you shouldn't even notice the swap methods are encrypting data.
