I don't want to start the next flamewar too, but I've tested your
patch several weeks ago and it worked very well for me, i.e.
neither netscape, nor xemacs nor X died during heavy mmap() and
malloc() tests. I had also merged it with andrea's vm-global-2
and got good results (vm-global-2 seems smarter than the default
kernel). anyway, since your oomkill patch only acts in desperate
situations, I think it's a good thing because when an app must die,
and it's better if we can choose which one.
BTW, it seems as andrea's vm-global-2 works well with lastests 2.2.17pre
kernels containing marcello's fixes (couldn't get a kill yet, but if it
happens, the oom killer should help).
Cheers,
Willy
