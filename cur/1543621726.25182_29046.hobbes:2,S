  I believe I'm the anonymous `he' you refer to.

  I had the impression that most people just stopped whingeing on lkml
but didn't actually try the code.  I've had very very little feedback
or apparent interest on gcml2.  In the meantime ESR's Python code got
less buggy and faster and I upgraded my main devel box to a distro
which had Python2 on it.  The Python code had limped up to the `adequate'
mark and my time is finite so I moved on.
  Look if I thought gcml2 was a serious contender to be used as the kernel
config tool of choice I would drop everything else and finish it.

  So you're implying that I colluded with ESR to use gcml2 as a decoy
to ease acceptance of his Python2 implementation?  Hah, I *wish* I was
that organised or devious!
