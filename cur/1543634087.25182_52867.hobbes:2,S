You are using old drivers. The oddities with the newer SBP-2 drives has
been fixed in later 2.4.19-pre kernels, aswell as the source from our
subversion repository. You can get a tarball of the repo from here:
http://svn.debian.org/linux1394/tarballs/
Move drivers/ieee1394/ out of the way, and unpack that (still requires a
2.4.19-pre kernel though).
