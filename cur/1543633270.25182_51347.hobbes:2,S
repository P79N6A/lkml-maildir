Hmm.. 2.5.21 and the bug is still there....
Well, here's why it happens:
the mp_ioapic_routing structure is if-deffed for IO_APIC,
while it's extensively being used in mp_parse_prt() which is if-deffed for 
ACPI_PCI only. Therefore, it ends up being undefined when we have
checked on ACPI and LOCAL_APIC, and off IOAPIC.
How to fix it?
Umm, I do not know.
I'm a newbie...
I was hoping somebody else would fix it, but that's not happening.
The ifdef statements have to be set up correctly..
I am still curious as to why this file is even being compiled....
it seems to contain only multiprocessor stuff....
But it's compiled for everybody that says yes to LOCAL_APIC,
including non-smp boxes....
