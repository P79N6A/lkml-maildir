The IBM Thinkpad documentation mentions this (or used to) you cannot
suspend a Thinkpad (using APM?) while there is a card powered in the
PCMCIA/Cardbus slot.  You could try doing "cardctrl eject" before
suspending - I find that this works for me (Thinkpad T22).
The message "apm: suspend: Unable to enter requested state" is an
indication of an error from the BIOS.
