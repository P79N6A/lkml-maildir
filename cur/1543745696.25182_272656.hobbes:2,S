I thought about that when writing up this patch, but decided against it.
I figured it was overkill and was going to make the patch more complicated
than it needed to be to solve the main problem I have seen, which is
userspace code, usually hotplug/coldplug scripts, reading config space
when an adapter is running BIST.
If you think there are usages of the pci_bus_* functions in the
kernel after the adapter device driver gets loaded, from callers other
than adapter device drivers and userspace APIs, I would have to agree
with you. I was hoping to keep this patch as simple as possible.
Having to protect the pci_bus_* functions requires a lookup in these
functions to find the pci_dev to get the saved_config_space, which
I was hoping to avoid.
Ben - do you have any concerns with this limitation for the use you have
for this set of APIs?
