Hi,
	I'm trying to comunicate some parameters from kernel to a module.
	I define a new function somwhere in kernel and after rebuilding
the version of my function is something like :
c027b7f0 function_R__ver_function (# cat /proc/ksyms | grep function)
(somewhere in *.ver files I can see the correct version)
And if I want to insert my module in kernel I get an error :
func.o: unresolved symbol function (because of the wrong function version)
Something is wrong, but I don't know what ...
You can help me ?
Best Regards
Adrian Stanila
P.S. I'm a newbie in kernel hacking and I don't want to disturb you but
if you can help me ... please answer to my email :)))
