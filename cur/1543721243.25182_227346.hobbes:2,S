Hello
If I go to the line in make menuconfig reading "USB Human Interface Devices (HID)"
and enter <Help> I get
"There is no help available for this option".
Maybe the help is not intended to be there.
However what I consider being a bug is that when I <Exit> from the help, the cursor
jumps at the start of the USB chapter and because USB is lenghty the original
position is lost.
This doesn't happem for other entries wher <Help> is available.
