WARN didn't help much. I then got the warning twice, followed by
another BUG:
process klogd
ehci_irq
usb_hcd_irq
handle_IRQ_event
handle_fasteio_irq
do_IRQ
So I set it back to BUG. Crashing hard isn't so bad when I
know what is coming - I simply remount everything synchronously
before trying.
I hope these printk's help. I can add more of them too, if needed.
Big transfers seems to bring out the worst - I always get the
crash on the first megabyte now. 
During boot I get lots of those "Hardware error, end-of-data detected"
messages, but I've never seen it crash during bootup.
