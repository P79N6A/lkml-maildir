I do have the latest version of modutils (at least, the one required by
Documentation/Changes - 2.4.2), but I still have to all the line add
path=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/* to /etc/modules.conf. 
ONLY then it works. At least it worked until yesterday... Yesterday I
found out that I can't use CD-ROM on one of the machines, and, in
particular, when I am trying to access it - together with ide.o,
iso9660.o, also get loaded lp.o, parport.o and parport-pc.o... with no
visible reason... But I am not sure if this should be associated with
modutils or whatever... Why did I need that line?
Thanks
Guennadi
