My only beef with this patch set is that it seems
a bit much to create a totally new function name every
time we want to set some kind of new attribute on some
DMA object.  Why not add a "dma_set_flags()" or similar
that can be used later on to set other kinds of aspects
we'd like to change?
You can make the arguments "u32 flags" and "int dir".
Actually you should probably use the dma direction
enumaration instead of 'int'.
