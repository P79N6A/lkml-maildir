Yes indeed...
I was trying to reduce time taken by a processes handling lot of files (thus 
vmalloc()ing fdtables and fdset). I noticed a high oprofile hit in 
fget_light(). I suspected overhead caused by vmalloc(), but obviously, once 
the vmalloc() mapping is done, the array of pointers wont be used until vfree().

Your point is valid. And it seems there is not much cpu used to linearly scan 
vmlist (to find the vm_struct), at least on my little servers.
