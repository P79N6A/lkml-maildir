I assumed the condition 'while (start_pfn < end_pfn  && .. )' asks for atleast
a PAGE_SIZE difference between them and hence went ahead with that patch.
My guess was a 1-byte , 2-byte or a (PAGE_SIZE -1)-byte reservations may not even
go into that loop.  However we just need a fix for this problem. So if there is a 
better fix that you have please post it to lkml.
