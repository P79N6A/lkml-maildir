That statement is misleading.  The kernel has _always_ used the command
line passed from the boot loader in preference to the built-in command
line.
The thing that's changed is that the kernel how honors the value passed
from the boot loader in R2 to find out where the ATAG list is - as
documented since 2002 that it will eventually do.  That's 5 years
of warning.
