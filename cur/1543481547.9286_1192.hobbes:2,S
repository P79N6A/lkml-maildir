Until 2.1.1xx (early '100s), there was a bug that resulted in processes
hanging on TCP connections.  Now and then, I have hundreds of "inews -h"
processes running at the same time.  Some percent of them stay forever,
connection (over the local interface) is "ESTABLISHED" from one side and
"SYN_RECV" from the other side.  At one moment, IP guys fixed this and
this effect disappered.
Now, in 2.2.0-final, it is back again :-(
