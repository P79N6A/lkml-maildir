I ran some tests lately that showed gettimeofday() to be 50x slower than
rdtsc() on my 600Mhz machine.  Many userspace apps that need a cheap
high res timer have to use rdtsc now due to the excessive overhead of
gettimeofday().  It would be more correct if these apps could use
gettimeofday() for various reasons (cpufreq and SMP issues).
So this patch is addressing a real problem.  I'd be interested to see if
the performance is good enough to replace rdtsc in these cases.
