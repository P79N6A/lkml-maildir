Ok looks like your cold medicine is working well for you ;-). This patch 
on top of the other patch has the memory freeing _and_ burns good cds. 
Well done. I only tested with a video cd. Can someone confirm audio cd 
(although it seems obvious it would help both).
Andrew did you threaten to make a 2.6.8.2 since 2.6.8{,.1} cannot safely 
burn an audio cd?
