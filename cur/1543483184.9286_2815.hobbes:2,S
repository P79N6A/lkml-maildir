Well, it's possible that bitkeeper can help with this somehow.  I'll have
to think about it.  Part of what you described is somewhat similar to
something we're gonna have to do anyway, just to get people interested in
actually using a source mgmt system for the kernel.  What I mean is that
we will be providing a a revision controlled version of the kernel, with
all the history we can find (thanks to Riley's most excellent web page,
we're feeling like it will be pretty complete) when we release v1.0 of
bitkeeper next month.  
Until bitkeeper becomes (he says confidently) the default way of doing
business, we'll be taking each update released by Linus, checking it in
and making both the tarball and the patch available on ftp.bitmover.com
(soon to be ftp.bitkeeper.com, the owner of that domain has given it to
me because he wanted to be helpful to the Linux community, way cool).
I still need to add module support to bitkeeper, so I can't really
address the problem yet, but that might help if we had the x86 module,
the generic module, etc.
