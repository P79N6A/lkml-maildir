Could you spell out what "DLM" stands for at the top of the header file,
like you do in the configuration blurb, something like the following:
< * Interface to DLM - routines and structures to use DLM lockspaces.
> * Interface to Distributed Lock Manager (DLM) lockspaces.
To some outsiders, DLM is just another unrecognized three letter
acronym.
