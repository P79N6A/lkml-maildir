Can you test it on 2.5? It applies cleanly and builds with 2.5.3, but I
was having trouble booting the 2.5 kernel on RedHat 7.2. Not needing to
work on 2.5 just yet, I gave up rather quickly and just tested on 2.4.
Anyway, I can send you my test patch and a brief description of what I
looked for to make sure it was working on 2.4.
