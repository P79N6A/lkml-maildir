Yes.

Can you try the attached mem-eater passing it the number of kb to be eaten.
	i.e. '# while :; do ./eatm 9999 ; done' 
This will print the number of bytes eaten and the timing in ms.
Adjust the number of kb to be eaten such that the timing will be less than 
timeslice (120ms by default for spa).  Switch to another vt and start 
pressing enter.  A console lockup should follow within seconds for all spas 
except ebs.
Thanks!
