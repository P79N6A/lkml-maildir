Do you perhaps have a video card with 128MB on board? I had the same
symptoms as you, and it turned out to be the vesafb driver. It basically
tries to ioremap the entire framebuffer and can't fit it in the reserved
area because it's only 128MB. You can either boot with vga=0 or some
such text mode, which disables the vesafb, or patch vesafb to only
ioremap the space needed for the video mode selected. BTW, the same
applies to rivafb and others I suspect, if your video card has 128MB ram.
