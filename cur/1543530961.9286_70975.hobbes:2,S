Snipped from the DU man page:
            MADV_SPACEAVAIL
                      Ensure that resources are reserved
  [ENOSPC]  The behav parameter specifies MADV_SPACEAVAIL and resources can
            not be reserved.
Not particularly verbose, and I presume it's only a point-check
against overcommit, since another process could come along and
gobble everything up.
