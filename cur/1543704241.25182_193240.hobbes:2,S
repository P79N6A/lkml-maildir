It's a good first start, thanks for doing this. You really want to be
storing this info in the queue, though, there's a hardsector size just
for this very purpose. That way other layers know about the hardware
sector size as well, not just ide-cd. And you get other things right for
free as well, for instance ide_cdrom_prep_fs() needs a correct hardware
block size or it will build wrong cdbs.

Hmm, you made it a bit more confusing. It should read that writes must
be hardware sector aligned. Something ala
	if ((rq->nr_sectors << 9) & (sector_size - 1) ||
	    (rq->sector & ((sector_size >> 9) - 1)))
		problem

if you feel you must print this, then do it in the same line as the
other cdrom info printed.
