Maybe, but right now it certainly isn't. Trying to migrate everything
to devfs is likely to leave you with half of the neither-process-nor-
device stuff in /proc and the rest in /devfs, leaving you with two
kitchen sinks. Please don't try to do this.
Besides, I don't quite understand all the fuss about /proc. It's not
overly hard to distinguish process and non-process entries (isdigit),
and I doubt that readdir'ing over the respective wrong kind is much of
a performance issue. So moving them elsewhere may at best create a lot
of forced upgrades (i.e. basically everything reading /proc also reads
non-process entries).
Some people argue that the non-process entries in /proc should
disappear entirely. I don't want to re-iterate this particular
discussion, just let me say that a large percentage of people putting
things into /proc disagree with this view :-) Also let me point out
that /proc entries are typically self-contained, which is a major
advantage for deployment.
