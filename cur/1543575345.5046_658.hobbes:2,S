This is precisely my problem.
K6-2, model 8, stepping 12.
Thus far, everything is *fine*, as long as MTRR is not compiled into
the kernel.
If MTRR is compiled into the kernel, I get lock-ups in X *only*, and
the entire machine locks.
I have no data on other CPUs; as I said, I previously had a P166, so
no MTRR there to compare against.
I assume that since you had a K6 266 earlier, with no problems, that
the problem must exist in this model and stepping of the CPU
(otherwise, if it were X you would have seen the problem
previously. Ditto for the kernel).
Kernel gurus, ideas for a workaround, other than "Don't use MTRR"?
