Subject: TIMER0 interrupt's problem in kernel 2.6.21 ( realview-smp_defconfig)

I am running kernel 2.6.21 on my realview_eb_mpcore system.
at the beginning I found the program is stuck at calibrating
loop................, this is because that the timer0 didn't give out
any interrupt.
after enable the timer0's interrupt, I found that even when there is
no timer interrupt the interrupt routine (realview_timer_interrupt()
)is still reached.
I added a timer interrupt disable instruction in the routine
realview_timer_interrupt() , which makes sure that after the first
interrupt the interrupt would be disabled. even in this situation , I
can still see that the interrupt routine is accessed by the cpu.
I guess this maybe caused by the problem of the gic_ack() or some
other functions?
does anyone ever meet such a situation?
anyone knows how to handle this?
any idea is  appreciated.
regards,
Yang
