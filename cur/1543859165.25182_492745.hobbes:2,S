I leave the actual hardware acquisitions up to HPA, I just try to keep
the machines up and running without too many problems.  HP has been
incredibly supportive of kernel.org in the past and I for one have been
very appreciative of their hardware and would love to continue working
with them.

I've mentioned this to the other admins and the consensus was that there
would be quite the outcry to suggest this - if the consensus is to
disable gitweb until we can get it under control we would take doing
that into consideration.

On average we are moving anywhere from 400-600mbps between the two
machines, on release days we max both of the connections at 1gpbs each
and have seen that draw last for 48hours.  For instance when FC6 was
released in the first 12 hours or so we moved 13 TBytes of data.

The script that deals with the uploads also deals with the packaging -
so yes the problem is related.
