i'm not really one to argue on behalf of VMI, but i don't think it's as
dire make it out.  the VMI is client code of pv_ops, and as the kernel
changes that client code will simply have to adapt.  of course there are
theoretical limitations, but let's keep it grounded to practical reality.
the whole premise is evolution.  so throw out specific issues, and let's
adapt rather than fall deep into theoretical rhetoric.
thanks,
