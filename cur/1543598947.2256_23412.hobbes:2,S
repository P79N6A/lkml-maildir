Bonding reorders packets, which causes frequent retransmits and stalls in TCP.
One setup that doesn't is multipath routing (ip route .. with multiple 
nexthops over different interfaces). It'll only load balance (srcip, dstip,tos)
tuples though, not individual flows, but then it has the advantage that
it actually works.
