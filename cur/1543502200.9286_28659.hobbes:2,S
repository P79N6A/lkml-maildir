How often does a Macintosh user see the command line?
Is it a requirement of Windows 95 to use the DOS prompt?
Heck, Windows 95 *does* present a different filesystem when you're at
the command line (suddenly everything has abbreviated names). I'm not
arguing this means Windows 95 is a good design, but rather that it is
not as much a stumbling block for users as you're making out.
I think this is a fabricated reason to put the functionality into the
kernel. GUI users *don't* use the command line. People who do use the
command line will understand the implications and will move the whole
directory (using tar, or recursive copy).

This is a programming issue not a user issue. You might as well argue
that /proc is broken by design because procutils needs to be modified
every now and then to understand new entries.

Then fix the shell. Bash isn't in the kernel.
For another example of shell magic consider the dotfile standard. The
kernel doesn't have a "hidden" bit. The shell and GUI alike both hide
files beginning with a period. Why is this impossible for albods?

Why? They're different things. Why should they look the same?
