...and yet another method for root filesystems is to use a boot
commandline arguments.  So, you have
a)sysctls (/proc entries)
b)initrd (and thus /dev entires)
or 
c)Boot args
How many API's do you need?
If you need an elaborate interface, aren't you better booting an
initrd and using that to launch your config tool that then builds and
mounts your root fs?
