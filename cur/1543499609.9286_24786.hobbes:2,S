 Mixed SCSI/IDE, although the miscompares only happen on the IDE drive. 
As a side-note, if I use a compare prog that performs reads in 16Mb
blocks, the same input file will actually miscompare with itself (!!!). 
'diff' and md5sum do not aggravate the problem.
 If I compare 2 files (between SCSI and IDE) it works fine, If I compare
between SCSI/SCSI it also works fine.  
 My guess is there may be something happening with read buffer
management.  The files are OK as written, we just see errors at
read-time when the data is returned from fread().
