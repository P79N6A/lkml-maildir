(looking at .28 code)
run_hrtimer_pending() reads like:
while (pending timers) {
  __remove_hrtimer(timer, HRTIMER_STATE_CALLBACK);
  spin_unlock(&cpu_base->lock);
  fn(timer);
  spin_lock(&cpu_base->lock);
  timer->state &= ~HRTIMER_STATE_CALLBACK; // _should_ result in HRTIMER_STATE_INACTIVE
  if (HRTIMER_RESTART)
    re-queue
  else if (timer->state != INACTIVE) {
    // so another cpu re-queued this timer _while_ we were executing it.
    if (timer is first && !reprogramm) {
      __remove_hrtimer(timer, HRTIMER_STATE_PENDING);
      list_add_tail(timer, &cb_pending);
    }
  } 
}
So in the window where we drop the lock, one can, as you said, have
another cpu requeue the timer, but the rb_entry and list_entry are free,
so it should not cause the data corruption we're seeing.
