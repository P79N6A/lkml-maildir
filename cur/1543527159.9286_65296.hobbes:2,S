Dear Stephen,
   In a perfect world people wouldn't remove
floppies until it was safe. I agree the amiga's
ability to "mount" more floppies than drives was
useful before hard disks but less so nowadays. I
suppose the closest equivalent now would be
CD or tape libraries.
   However, to protect users who have a
removable media removed whilst writes are occurring -
Is there a way of remembering unwritten data
and requeueing it if a semi-written media
is placed back in.
   If the data were retained for 5 minutes
or until a different disk were inserted (check
for fs-ID).
   Hmmm, it doesn't sound like a trivial amount
of work - maybe user education is easier.
   Tim
