These are _kernel_ headers.
Sure, applications are abusing the kernel headers as userspace library.
But this is wrong, that's not what they are designed for.
Look at the code MySQL uses for including atomic.h and you understand 
what I'm saying.
If stuff from the headers is generally considered useful for userspace, 
someone should simply start a new project containing the small subset of 
the headers containing such stuff cleaned up for userspace.
