I've now received this and it's linked from:
http://www.earth.li/~noodles/hardware-e3.html
Interesting (to me at least) points:
* Camera source included and seems to present as a standard v4l device.
* The keyboard driver is a module (not included) - there's a stub
  present presumably so basic init works.
* The Pegasus USB networking module is compiled in; I've confirmed it
  initialises such a device, but see no network traffic (CONFIG_IP_PNP
  and friends are enabled in the .config provided, but I guess this may
  be from a debug tree?)
* There's Belkin USB serial device support in the .config as well, but I
  can't see any output when I hook up such a device.
I've setup a list at:
http://www.earth.li/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/e3-hacking
for anyone who wants to discuss the hardware/software of the device.
What I'd really like to see is a dump of the flash from the device, in
the hope that the startup scripts might do something with the ethernet.
However I don't have the appropriate kit to be able to do this.
Alternatively it looks like there's a serial console on ttyS0 (UART1 on
the OMAP?), but I can't see any obvious pads where that's brought out
to.
(Oh, and as a semi related aside; if anyone has GPL contacts in Linksys
I'd be most interested to know about them - I'm completely failing to
get hold of kernel source for the WMA11B, which runs 2.4.17-rmk3-cot1.)
