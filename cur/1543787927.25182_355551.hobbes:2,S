  i was not privy to the design discussions: unfortunately i was only
  given brief conclusions and hints by the designer.
  my guess is that yes, as the later messages in this thread
  hint at, CAM is probably the key: 256 blocks of 32-bit CAM,
  something like that.
  CAM is known to help dramatically decrease execution time
  by orders of magnitude in linked list algorithms such as
  searching and sorting, esp. where each CAM cell has built-in
  processing, like the aspex.net massively-deep SIMD architecture has.
