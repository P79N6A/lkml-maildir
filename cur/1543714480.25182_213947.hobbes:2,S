Well, bear in mind that in a number of ways these patches actually
simplify the hugetlb code, although I think most of that is not
inherently related to making the hugepage allocation on-demand rather
than prefaulted.  Nonetheless, doing the demand allocation is actually
really easy.  Even if you add COW as well, which these patches don't,
it doesn't actually make the hack any worse than it was already, but
it does make it more useful.
