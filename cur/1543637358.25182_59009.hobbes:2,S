It was not my intention to provide something unimportant to lkml, but
the same config worked on the same machine in linux-2.5.27 and then was
not working on 2.5.28.  Since it had only recently broken, it's more
likely that whatever broke it will still be fresh on somebody's mind and
I was hoping that would make it easier for someone to fix.
