Good. Then don't go around calling it ext2 any more. I don't want to have
people even _wondering_ about the stability of the central Linux
filesystem. 
I would also suggest that Stephen actually drop ext2 altogether. There's
just too much historical stuff in most filesystems - things like having
"." and ".." in directories, even though Linux doesn't need them and they
only complicate renaming and loopback mounting a lot. There's also a lot
of code to handle concurrent writes etc, which can't happen any more.
This is why I'm so upset at even the notion of extending ext2 - not only
do I dislike the fact that Stephen was going to do it in-place (and I'm
happy to hear he no longer considers that), I think that if people are
doing a new filesystem, it should be done like "ext2" was originally done: 
by designing a new one, rather than building more scaffolding on top of an
old one.
