Hi,
developing a driver (currently with a vanilla 2.4.20 kernel) for a PCI
card i encountered a mysterious behaviour. I get the IO addresses from
the card configuration space and use ioremap_nocache to get virtual
addresses for usage with write[bwl]. This works to some extend (the card
behaves as expected). But then at some random moment i get error
messages about dereferencing a NULL pointer and severe crashes
afterwards. When i put a printk("%p\n",address) before each write[bwl]
everything is fine (appart from lots of log entries). I also tried wmb()
after the write commands which didn't help. Any idea?
Mit freundlichen Gruessen / Best regards
