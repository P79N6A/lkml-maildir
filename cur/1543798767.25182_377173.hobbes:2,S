Hrm... there is a wmb in the unlock path, I suppose on all platforms,
and iirc, ppc & ppc64 implementation of config space accesses do a full
sync. On x86, they are IO ports, thus I would expect them to be fully
sychronous, but I can't guarantee that semantic is respected accross all
architectures.
