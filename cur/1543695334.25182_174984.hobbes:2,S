Try first to isolate the kind of disk activity happening: is it writes,
reads, a mix of them ?. Start some monitoring program like "vmstat",
"sar" or even "xosview" or "gkrellm" to see the kind of disk access
pattern happens when your box does things of its own :-)
Also, to put swap out of the equation you could disable it and see if
the problem happens again, etc.
