On Thu, 19 Apr 2001, Marc Karasek did have cause to say:

Most gettys and such take a /dev/tty* argument, which has to be changed to
point to the serial port for a serial console. Config scripts (and
anything else) specifically using /dev/tty or /dev/console should work
fine, however. (I wouldn't recommend pointing a getty at /dev/console - we
had some issues on a headless server trying that. Easiest to point it at
/dev/ttyS0 or whatnot.)
