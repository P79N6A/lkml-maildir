It probably depends where in the 2.5 cycle you are up to. 
While there are still a lot of changes going in, it isn't so critical.
When it gets to 2.5.99 and later, you need to track absolutely everything. 
Even if that means entering the problem, and 20 minutes later entering the 
patch that corrects it, and the next day closing the bug against Linus' next 
release. 
Given a resourced bug tracker, and the various test projects, this could be a 
nice smooth release producing a product without gaping holes. But its 
probably a bit soon to tell...
