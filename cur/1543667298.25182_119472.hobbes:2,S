Hey,
I've seen several emails (google) telling me request_module() is
supposed to be broken in earlier versions of 2.5.x (e.g.
http://hypermail.idiosynkrasia.net/linux-kernel/archived/2003/week02/0127.html
). In 2.5.65, is it still supposed to be broken? The function returns 0 but the module I'm trying to load isn't actually being loaded. In 2.4.20, it works.
Thanks,
Ronald
