Subject: [PATCH] ibmtr 2.3.48 kfree in hard irq fix and shared ram paging implementation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Attached is a patch for the ibm token ring tropic chipset driver that
implements shared ram paging on the adapters. This patch improves that
performance of these adapters significantly. Please see the readme file for
more details.
This patch was put together by Mike Sullivan of ibm fame who asked me to
forward this patch for inclusion into the kernel so that he can get an idea
of what is involved in submitting patches / drivers.  I'm sure he will
shortly be submitting his driver for the lanstreamer cards that is currently
available on the ibm site. :)
Also the patch contains the small fixes required to stop the warning: kfree
in hard irq meseages as well.
Alan - I have a patch for 2.2.14, but will hold off until 2.2.15 is released
following your message about 2.2.15pre12
Thanks all
