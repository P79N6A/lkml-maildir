DMA0 is used by lots of 386/486 era systems for memory refresh. It is
also "borrowed" by some other systems that know it isnt available to the
OS. There are a couple of heuristics I've seen suggested by vendors of
things like sound cards
1.	Check the PnPBIOS information (never looked into this myself)
2.	Assume DMA 0 is free if the machine has a PCI bus detected
3.	Read the DMA 0 counter a few times. If it is continually 	changing
don't use DMA 0
#2 is certainly a good idea IMHO, I don't know how well the others work.
