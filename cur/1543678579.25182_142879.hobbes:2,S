Did you enable parallel port (lp) in BIOS, and in the kernel?  In my
experience this could happen if you do 2) and didn't do 1) ....
Promise uses exactly what IRQ?  You didn't told us.  I have 2 boxes with
Promises here (20265, 20267, yes I know older ones) and they use 10 and
12 respectively, without problems ...
