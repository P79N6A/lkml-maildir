I know this is insane, and will probably make my computer explode, 
however, is there any way to rescan the IDE bus?
I have in the past booted a system to upgrade, taken it single user,
mounted all filesystems readonly, then chrooted a bash to a nfs server,
pulled the old hard disk, put in the new one, dd'd a pre-written filesystem
onto the new disk, (with linear set in it's lilo)
rebooted, refdisked to get the first partition ending in a sane place,
then rebooted again, and continued installing.
It was a laptop, and it would have been really annoying to make a 
PCMCIA supporting bootdisk, with NFS, and network drivers.
So, is it possible to skip the reboot?
