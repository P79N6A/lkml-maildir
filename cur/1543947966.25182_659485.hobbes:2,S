yup, I'll grab that.  I'll even write your changelog for you (grr).
But first, let's do this:
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>
People are adding `noinline' in various places to prevent excess stack
consumption due to gcc inlining.  But once this is done, it is quite unobvious
why the `noinline' is present in the code.  We can comment each and every
site, or we can use noinline_for_stack.
