I think the issue is that there is no main "security" contact for the
kernel.  If we want to make vendor-sec that contact, fine, but we better
warn the vendor-sec people :)

vendor-sec handles a lot of other stuff that is not kernel related
(every package that is in a distro.) This would only be for the kernel.
