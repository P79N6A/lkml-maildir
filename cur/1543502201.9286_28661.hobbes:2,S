Well, the Mac does not store icons with every file in the general case,
it just stores the type and creator codes, which is similar to a mime
type thing. The icons itself are stored in the desktop database.
But there is an exception on the Mac that I use quite often: There is
a custom icon attribute that allows one to have a customized icon for
each individual file, This comes handy if you have a directory full of
images (for example JPEG's from your digital camera) and each icon is
not the generic JPEG icon but a thumbnail of the original. If you have
the thumbnail in the same file as the JPEG, all file management will
affect the thumbnail as well (move, copy ...).
