LVM can already do snapshots at the device level.  It integrates with
ext3/XFS/reiserfs via sync_super_lockfs/unlockfs so that what is in
the snapshot is a consistent, clean filesystem.
There might need to be a little touchup with ext2 to support these
calls, but even in the current state you get a usable filesystem
snapshot, with the exception that the filesystem has not been marked
clean.
As for a filesystem-level ext2/ext3 snapshot, this has also already
been done (sf.net/projects/snapfs).  The people who took over that
project have removed all of the released files and CVS, but you can
still get the CVS from the sourceforge CVS backups.  I also have a
version here, but don't have any time to work on it.
Cheers, Andreas
