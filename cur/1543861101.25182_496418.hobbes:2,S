Thanks for looking at this.
What you have here is the basic boilerplate for any generic container
subsystem. I realise that my current containers patch has some
incompatibilities with the way that nsproxy wants to work.

The current model is that rmdir fails if there are any processes still
in the container; so you'd have to kill processes by looking for pids
in the "tasks" info file. This was behaviour inherited from the
cpusets code; I'd be open to making this more configurable (e.g.
specifying that rmdir should try to kill any remaining tasks).

Right - the way to do this would probably be some kind of
"container_clone()" function that duplicates the properties of the
current container in a child, and immediately moves the current
process into that container.

If you want to be able to attach to different namespaces separately,
then possibly they should be separate container subsystems?
