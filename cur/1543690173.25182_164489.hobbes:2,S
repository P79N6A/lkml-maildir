in scsi.h there on line 215 is a list of variabls of type u8, now this 
is not defined as a type anywhere in scsi.h and with the only include (2 
includes i might add) is types.h.  This file does not define any type 
u8, rather there is a type __u8 that defines u_int8_t.  This looks like 
a mistake in scsi.h to me. Is there any reason why this is not wrong?
This is found in vanilla kernels from at least test4 and i bet further 
back as well.
