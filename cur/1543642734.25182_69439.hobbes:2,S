i have spinlock debugging enabled - but indeed the trace could be
incorrect, let me re-check it.
doh, wrong script called ... the right backtrace is:

(we definitely need kksymoops in the 2.5 kernel - it's just *so* much
easier to debug various crashes with kksymoops enabled - especially when
debugging over a serial line.)
and this lockup definitely looks related to the signal changes.
