I'm glad the patch has struck a spark!  Yes, there doesn't appear to
be anything else that you'd need to do.  Except, why was it disabled
in the first place?  I think you'll need to reassure yourselves that
whatever the reason was has gone away, before reenabling.
Andrew, please drop 06/15, I don't think anything after depends on it
(but it came about when I was looking at uninlining pte_offset_map_lock).
