Hello Trond, Andy.
Thank you, both, for the prompt reply.

Actually, I just played around with the timeouts... It seems to work (only
one try, which is quite bad statistics...) also for a soft mount (hard
mount works anyway) when I raise "retrans" to 20. At retrans=15 I still
get a timeout (but much later, after about 30MB transmitted). This is for
an internal connection via only one switch, and with no significant
network load at the moment.
Which makes me wonder, since our system did not have any such problems for
years with the default retrans=3 (and soft mounts), until we ran into
2.4.20. That's why I actually did not expect that there was a need for
finetuning these parameters, and not by this amount... . 2.4.19 was
running fine, so something has to have changed on the way to 2.4.20.

I will test the patch tomorrow, yes, thank you. I'll keep you informed.
Best regards,
