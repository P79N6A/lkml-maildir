How about
"Say "Y" or "M" if you have a Promise Fasttrak (tm) Raid controller
and want linux to use the softwarraid feature of this card.
This driver uses /dev/ataraid/dXpY (X and Y numbers) as device names.
If you have a Promise Fasttrak(tm) card but do not use the BIOS provided
raid feature, say "N".
