I now know what the problem is.
In drivers/scsi/aha152x.c, there is an array of two scsi hosts:
        static struct Scsi_Host *aha152x_host[2];
There is also the aha152x_probe_one method.
The problem is that each re-insert of the card creates a new 'host' via aha152x_probe_one,
which increments the registered_count variable. This variable is used as an index into the afore-
mentioned 2-element host array. When registered_count is 2 or greater we're in no-man's land,
hence the crashes. I'm currently testing a fix for this, which I hope to post soon.
