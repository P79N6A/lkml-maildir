Yes there are two styles of the controllers.
Are we up to flag settings based on the hwif->chipset ident?
if (hwif->chipset != ide_pci)
	do_an_irq_thingy...........
Since some device that are PCI cards but have this flag used for other
identification..........OOPS.......
if (hwif->pci_dev)
	do_an_irq_thingy...........
This may be a better option............ponder...........
