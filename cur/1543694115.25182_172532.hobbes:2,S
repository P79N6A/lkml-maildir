Tried this. It wants jade. Installed jade. jade is a X Window
System appliaction. During compilation of
docbook-utils-0.6.13 I got a message:
Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:
I am doing this on a router where I have no X server. How can
I view Linux Kernel HTML documentation on a router where I have got only
an ssh access and no X server?
I suggest considering replacing the DocBook bloatware for something
more sane in the kernel tree. You could maybe generate the html
docs yourself and simply put them somewhere into the Documentation/
directory into the kernel sources. Or at least on the web, but then
the people offline couldn't even read the instruction manual for their
kernel.

I don't use any distro. I have compiled my operating system from scratch.

Your talk about distros is OT. I don't have any distro. I have built my
system from the source. I just
want to know how to build the kernel HTML docs.
I have built Gnome, Qt, Xfree86, gcc, glibc, j2sdk1.4.1 and mozille from
sources, but haven't used dpkg or rpm yet.
If Linux Kernel is package-only, please tell me. I will do a cat /dev/zero >
/dev/hda then and move on to OBSD then.
