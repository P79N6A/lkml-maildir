Subject: [README] linux-kernel has moved
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/17/1

The old vger ate it's primary disk the other evening, and I was
scheduled to move the lists to the new site soon anyways.
So everyone can now get their 200 email a day linux-kernel fix
once more, just join up using majordomo at vger.redhat.com
No digests, no archiving, just the plain lists.  I'll turn on
the features later when I get more time on my hands.
I'll send out notifications similar to this as I move other
lists over to the new machine.
Thanks for your patience/understanding.
Later,
David S. Miller
