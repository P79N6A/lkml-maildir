The notifier is auto-disarmed by mmu_notifier_release, your patch
works the same way. ->release is further called just in case anybody
wants to know the notifier was disarmed.

Good point, it has to be called earlier for GRU, but it's not a
performance issue. GRU doesn't pin the pages so it should make the
global invalidate in ->release _before_ unmap_vmas. Linux can't fault
in the ptes anymore because mm_users is zero so there's no need of a
->release_begin/end, the _begin is enough.
In #v6 I was invalidating inside unmap_vmas so it was ok. The
performance issues you're talking about refers to #v6 I guess, for #v7
there's a single call.
Thanks!
