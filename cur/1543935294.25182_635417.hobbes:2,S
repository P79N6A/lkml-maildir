Dear all
A lot of google searches reflect that, the latest kernel supporting
Huawei EC321 CDMA PCCARD is 2.6.17. My version (2.6.22-14 on Ubuntu)
doesn't work.
I am not sure if I should file a bug somewhere or how to contact the
right person. I see another version of this card (Huawei E220) was
discussed on this list and so I though this is the right place to post
this information. Redirect me to someone else if I posted in wrong
place, thank you. 
I can give away my card to someone if they can use it to modify driver
to add the support back. I can also type some commands and get you the
result if you ask me to. What I cannot is describe it technically good
enough to show the problem without other's prompt/help. I also cannot
debug program or read source code.
I need to emphasize this is a very common model card in China mainland,
it's the "default" one, many of my friends has it. So it make sense to
get the support back.
dmesg on 2.6.22-14 (that doesn't work):

Some other users on the Internet says this is because the device is
mis-recognized (should be 3G data card but mis-recognized as GSM modem.
I am not sure if this is the case, because I could not find the phase
"3G data card" in drivers/usb/serial/option.c in  2.6.22-14 kernel, this
phrase existed in 2.6.17 in option.c
For your information, EC321 is a CDMA card, in sales people's words,
it's way too different from GSM. I am dumb on this anyway.
Best regards.
