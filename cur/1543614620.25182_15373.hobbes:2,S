I have tested on a couple of legacy free boxes. However they still have
what were once ISA devices lurking (IDE initial setup etc). Many PCI only
boxes have serial ports, parallel, floppy, even ISA style audio devices
on the mainboard internal busses
ISA slots I agree is a useful distinction however
