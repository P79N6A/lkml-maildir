Hello Charlotte,
     I have just noticed that the garbled X-server mode is different
than what I thought it was. rinfo->depth is 24, but rinfo->bpp is 32.
(measured in radeon_write_mode). I haven't yet thought through the
implications of this. I've been unable to get the display correct, but
I've been trying to fix the wrong mode.
     The console mode is ->depth==8, ->bpp==8, and presumably the same
when it's garbled, but I've been unable to reproduce the problem since
instrumenting the kernel.

That sounds like a good idea to me, but I'm not very familiar with the
programming practices here.

It looks like the X.org radeon driver doesn't support 24bpp.
