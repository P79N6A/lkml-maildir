By that logic CONFIG_SMP should be "y" by default.
Now i find the name NR_CPUS a bit misleading it seems that
this should be MAX_CPUS but "legacy is as legacy does".
Using the names i prefer i would suggest in *config we
replace CONFIG_SMP with CONFIG_MAX_CPUS and give it a
default of 1.  Then make CONFIG_SMP dependant on
CONFIG_MAX_CPUS > 1.  That way we avoid adding yet another
option. KISS for the users.
