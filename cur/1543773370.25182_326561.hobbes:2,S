it seems you don't like the patch for some personal reasons, and now your are 
trying to find arguments against it. The best method to get the perfomance 
implications is trying it (the patched kernel).

If you introduce something new (higher resolution clock), you should start with 
something clean. Just hacking it in the first attempt, anf then making it 
beautiful in a second attempt is a waste of time IMHO.
