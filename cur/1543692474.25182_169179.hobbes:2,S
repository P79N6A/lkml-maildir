Has anybody checked out whether the kernel works with -mregparm=3? I
forget who did a lot of the work on it originally, and it certainly _used_
to work fine. The improvements to both code size and performance were, if 
I remember correctly, measurable but not huge.
One worry (apart from just broken compilers and missing "asmlinkage" 
annotations) is that having compiler-version-dependent calling conventions 
makes for another variable to take into account when chasing down bugs and 
worrying about things like the Nvidia module etc. So it's probably not 
worth doing unless the advantages are clear.
