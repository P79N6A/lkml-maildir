   Perhaps these people worried about thread performance need to set their
priority scheme to SCHED_RR. Especially if it's a database you probably
want it to take a lot of your CPU time. This should end up with more
aggressive allocation of time slices, as long as appropriate sleeping is
going on it should fix this kind of thing.
   I've done some multimedia programming in Linux and appropriate thread
priority makes the difference between choppy and smooth thread
interactions.
