Hello,
on my custom board I have some leds mapped on a dedicated chip
connected via i2c bus.
If I try to use the heartbeat trigger I hang the system... I suppose
it is due the fact the led_set_brightness() function is called inside
a kernel timer.
How I can solve this problem? I thought to modify the trigger adding a
kernel thread who manage the led which in turn is controlled by the
kernel timer. It could be the right solution?
Thanks in advance,
Rodolfo
