I agree that it's a hack, but after digging around in the PCI code over
the last month and a half it has grown on me. :)

Yes, that idea doesn't work all the time.  If you let pci_assign_resource
allocate from the root of the resource tree, you will get all the resources
you want no problem.  However, it's entirely possible that you will be
allocated resource ranges that are intermingled with the ranges that are
behind other bridges or devices.  There's no sane way to program the
hotplug bridge's BARs in such a situation.
As I said above, I agree that the reservation scheme is hackish, but since
there's no clear way (to me at least) to rework the resource allocation
system to handle this problem, I feel its advantages outweigh its
disadvantages at the moment.
