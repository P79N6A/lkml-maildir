Thank you for trying, 
I also been using for compiling kernel for several days,
but, as Andi mentioned, currently the aki_copy is *dangerous* 
when any processes/threads ara using fpu register.
I read the code of laze FPU state saving and confirmed that 
if the function does not generate exception than
'kernel_fpu_begin/end()' should assure fpu safe inside kernel.
However, it is not enough where exception could rise, as Takahashi
mentioned.
I also have benchmark for small buffer which is enough to fit in cache
which I would like to show that aki_copy does perform well for this 
circumstances. 
But I have something urgent todo(homework :)) and I will come back to it
as soon as possible.
Thank you,
Akira Tsukamoto
