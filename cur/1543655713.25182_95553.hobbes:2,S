Yep, it's smc-ircc :)

Should I give up on it and go for Daniele's smsc-ircc2 ? I confess I hadn't
 used 2.5.xx for a couple of weeks awaiting for some form of stabilization
 of the new module code (don't blame me - I can only, ahem, "test" on
 my work laptop), and I had forgot about smsc-ircc2.
Since it seems someone could make some of the modular stuff work
 I'm back in the game :)
