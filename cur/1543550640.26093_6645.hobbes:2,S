I had another thought regarding resource scheduling -- has the idea
of a "weightless" process been brought up?  Weightless means it doesn't
count toward 'load' and the class strictly has lowest priority in the
system and gets *no* CPU unless there are "idle" cycles.  So even a
process niced to -19 could CPU starve a weightless process.
Perhaps if memory was needed, the paging code would page out weightless
processes first... etc?...
