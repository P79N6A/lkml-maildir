No.  Modern hard rivers are dar more complex than that.  All the ones I
have seen in the research labs are including at least a 200 MHZ ARM
processor on board.  Basically because of silicon feature size designers
have found themselves trying to fill put space.  So now have imbeeded
processors on many hard drivers.  They are really smart now days.  From
the discussion I have seen on this board it appears most people are
stuck talking baout 5 to 10 year old drive technology.  If people really
want to try and squezzy that last 5-10% performance out of the drivers,
go talk to the engineers, someone who actually designs them.  The
preformance increases will be a lot more and a lot easier to come by.
