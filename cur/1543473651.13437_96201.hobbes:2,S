	By any chance would this be what you are interested in?
	"Rule Set Based Access Control in Linux"
	
http://agn-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/people/1ott/rsbac/eng.htm
	It looks to be much more extensive than merely ext2fs ACLs.  There's
a curious remark in the ongoing list about "Role based ACLs":
]	Add Access Control Lists (ACL) module, based on roles (sic!),
]	users and request types. Likely for 1.0.8 or 1.0.9. 
	Not sure if that means that ACL's are currently in or out (my guess
is that they are not quite there yet) in the current version (1.0.7)
	There is also "Pretty Secure Linux" which is a project referenced
from that page but the link is currently down.  I don't have any further
information beyond that...
	Solar Designer had some secure Linux kernel patches, but AFAIK those
where not related to ACLs for ext2fs.
