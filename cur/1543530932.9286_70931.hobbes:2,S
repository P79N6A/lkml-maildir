I do not think this works.  All "linear" does is tell LILO to store
linear values in its map file and compute the corresponding CHS values
at boot time.  This limits LILO to accessing the first 8G of disk
always.  (Has this been changed in recent versions of LILO?)
Grub, on the other hand, can be configured to use LBA mode to talk to
the BIOS.  This *will* get around the 8G limitation, but it only
applies to recent versions of Grub (CVS sources; not sure about
released versions) and fairly recent BIOSes (last few years).
