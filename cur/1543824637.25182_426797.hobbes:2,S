Well, at least the cnxtserial.c file looks suspicious to me :
static int rs_write(struct tty_struct * tty, int from_user,
                    const unsigned char *buf, int count)
{
        int     c, total = 0;
        unsigned long flags;
        struct cnxt_serial *info = (struct cnxt_serial *)tty->driver_data;
                                                         ^^^^^
        if (serial_paranoia_check(info,tty->device, "rs_write"))
                                       ^^^^^
          return 0;
        if (!tty || !info->xmit_buf)
          return 0;
=> tty already referenced twice before the check. Either the check is
   useless, or the person who wrote it had a good reason for it which
   was not considered when writing the two lines above. I would suggest
   to start from something like this :
static int rs_write(struct tty_struct * tty, int from_user,
                    const unsigned char *buf, int count)
{
        int     c, total = 0;
        unsigned long flags;
        struct cnxt_serial *info;
        if (!tty)
        	return 0;
        info = (struct cnxt_serial *)tty->driver_data;
        if (serial_paranoia_check(info, tty->device, "rs_write"))
        	return 0;
        if (!info->xmit_buf)
        	return 0;
Further :
          c = MIN(count, MIN(SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE - info->xmit_cnt - 1,
                             SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE - info->xmit_head));
          if (c <= 0)
            break;
=> info->xmit_cnt and info->xmit_head are signed ints. If you encounter
   memory corruption (eg: during your ethernet transfers) and those get
   negative, nothing prevents the buffer from being overwritten past the
   end.
Further :
          if (from_user) {
            down(&tmp_buf_sem);
            copy_from_user(tmp_buf, buf, c);
            c = MIN(c, MIN(SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE - info->xmit_cnt - 1,
                           SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE - info->xmit_head));
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            memcpy(info->xmit_buf + info->xmit_head, tmp_buf, c);
            up(&tmp_buf_sem);
          } else
=> What the hell is this ? c was assigned the same value above, so
   we get :
   c = MIN(MIN(count, MIN(SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE - info->xmit_cnt - 1,
                       SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE - info->xmit_head)),
                      MIN(SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE - info->xmit_cnt - 1,
                       SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE - info->xmit_head));
   I'm not sure this was what the developper originally intented to do,
   but although useless, it does not seem incorrect. However, I don't
   know if he wanted to further reduce the buffer for any reason.
Also, it appears that nothing prevents any code running outside the
loop from changing info->xmit_buf between the restore_flags() and
the cli(). I don't know if this is functionnaly possible, but at
least it is possible by memory corruption (eg: padding too large
for a packet and writing zeroes past the end of one buffer).
You should definitely add printks or at least double checks
everywhere within this loop I think.
That's all I can tell, I don't know this platform at all.

Willy
