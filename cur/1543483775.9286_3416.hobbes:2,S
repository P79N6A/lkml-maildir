This is the standard mode of operation. The number of biods you run
on on other Unices has no impact on the max number of concurrent requests;
they just define the max number of concurrent async requests. Congestion
avoidance still takes place, and can go down to one.
As a rule of thumb, whenever the congestion avoidance algorithm gives
you problems, either your network or server is overloaded, or the
_max_ congestion window is too big. You shouldn't be seeing timeouts
on a big scale during normal operations at all. If you do, and try
to remedy the situation by increasing the network load even more (by
bumping the min congestion window) you usually make things worse.
