Subject: [PATCH] UML: BLKGETSIZE takes a long, not an int
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/15/348

The BLKGETSIZE ioctl expects a pointer to a long, os_file_size was providing
an int. Therefore, ubd access to host block devices caused a segmentation
fault on 64 bits systems.

Of course. I should have sent it correctly the first time. And I am terribly
sorry for the mess my mailer have done with my second mail.
Here is the hopefully correct patch, against current git.
