Read through the manual for your modem, and if it's not crappy, it will
have methods to let the user fix a bad firmware flash.  Without costly
RAM and backup batteries.
There are simple things (from one external ISDN terminal I know) like
having an emergency firmware in ROM that is activated by a special
powerup sequence.  It will then set the connection to a specified speed,
wait for a new firmware upload and flash that.
No big deal, you just have to get along without AT commands for
updating.  Similar things exist for at least some motherboard BIOSes
which have a write protected boot code which can load and flash the BIOS
from floppy without needing the rest of the BIOS to work.
IDE drives have nothing like that?
