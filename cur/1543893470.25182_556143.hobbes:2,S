The cast isn't done right. Doing "fd = (long) dev_id;" doesn't help, 
since you pass fd to mconsole_get_request() as is. And 
mconsole_get_request() expects an integer:
int mconsole_get_request(int fd, struct mc_request *req)
This will generate at least a warning on arches where sizeof(int) != 
sizeof(long). And as you say, then there is the problem with void 
pointers and longs.
And by the way, AFAIK, GCC has the habit of breaking compatibility with 
some userspace apps when a new GCC major version is released. And, 
AFAIK, they're moving towards standards, so relying on GCC's 
"guarantees" may backfire.

An example is sparc64:

Really, a kmalloc() isn't such a big deal, it only happens once and 
we're not in interrupt context. One the other hand, ensuring safety and 
portability on other arches is something that needs to be taken care of.
Of course, you could also cast to int when calling 
mconsole_get_request(), but IMO that doesn't look nicer.
