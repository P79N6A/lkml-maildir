Also, please try disabling the group scheduler and run the test again.
The group scheduler has known bad interactivity issues. Also be on the
watch for any abnormally high disk activity, to rule out starvation
due to the kernel choosing poor candidates for swap-in/swap-out.
(Running a vmstat 1 in a console ahead of time and watching for high
IO Wait -- the last column printed -- will give you a good indicator
other than the drive LED.)
