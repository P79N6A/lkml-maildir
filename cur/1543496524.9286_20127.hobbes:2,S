My system fails to boot any kernel past 2.2.5.
The system has a DPT SCSI controller and all drives are SCSI.
IDE drives are Zip and CD-ROM.
The kernel boots up until it identifies the first IDE controller
and then it dies.  No debugging information availble: ALT-SYSQ
doesn't work.
Before I get into gory details (and currently I'm unable to get
any), is this something common I can fix easily or do I need to dig?
My searches for information elsewhere didn't tell me anything that
seemed relevant.
I tried 2.2.9 and noticed the problem there, but have also tried
2.2.8 and 2.2.7 with the same results.
