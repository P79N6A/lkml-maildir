Not between -pre12 and -pre13, actually.  OTOH, new rd.c code _is_ new
and VM modifications between -pre12 and -pre13 might affect it.
rd.c _is_ screwed up right now, so I'd recommend to be careful with
vanilla -pre12 or -pre13.  I'm merging Andrea's stuff for normal
ramdisks with, erm, getting initrd into sane state, so as soon as
it gets local testing I'll post the patch.
