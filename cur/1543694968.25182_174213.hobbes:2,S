Okay, I'm scheduled to build a system next month, give me the name of a
good controller which will do four drives and which can be used as a
dumb controller as well, and I'll grab six drives for the build and run
a test (baring a change in schedule, obviously).
I'll run as many RAID configs as make sense, whatever the hardware
supports. And also four way RAID-1 for a heavy read application, to see
if the software RAID does better than the controller, if it can do that
at all.
