Maybe you have selected only RAID part of HPT370 in your kernel config, 
not the driver part at all.
RAID part in menuconfig (this seems to be on): 
<*> Support for IDE Raid controllers (EXPERIMENTAL)
  ...
  <*>    Highpoint 370 software RAID (EXPERIMENTAL)
But you also need the driver, as in menuconfig (this seems to be off):
[*]     HPT366/368/370 chipset support
Maybe the RAID part should not be selectable without the driver,
but when making own kernels you should know about many options
anyway.
