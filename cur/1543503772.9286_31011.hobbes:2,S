Exactly. But it has never been intended to be a realtime system in the
true sense of the word. Nor is that something we want to aim for. Consider
for a moment that systems like QNX don't implement things like the page
faulting half of virtual memory (though they still have separate address
spaces) and ask yourself why they don't even in 1999 and you might begin
to understand why there will never be an absolute guarantee on latency in
Linux. Our average performance will be better though.

But the traditional time share algorithm (SCHED_OTHER) is in fact better
for throughput (and fairness) than round-robin, et al. If you want
SCHED_RR, it's there. I guess the proposal is that we "progress" to
non-multi-user, non-time-sharing systems. Please point me to one of these
more modern systems so I can avoid it.
