Do you have a premonition... Game-test goes down in flames. Volatile to
the extent where I can't catch head or tail. It can behave like in
A3-O12.2 or as an unpatched 2.6.0-test2. Trigger badness by switching to
a text console. Sometimes it recovers, sometimes not. Sometimes fast,
sometimes slowly (when it does recover).
I'll withdraw under my rock now. Won't come forth until everything
smells of roses. Getting stressed by being a bringer of bad news only.
Please speak up, all you other testers. Divide the burden. Even out the
scores.
Greetings,
Mats Johannesson
