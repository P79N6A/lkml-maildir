Unfortunately the kernel is already full of counting semaphores. 
Priority inheritance won't save you, as the task which is going to call 
up() need not be the same one that called down().
Jamie Lokier's suggestion of raising priority when in the kernel doesn't 
help. You need to raise the priority of the task which is currently in 
userspace and will call up() next time it enters the kernel. You don't 
know which task that is.
There are three solutions I can think of:
1) don't have SCHED_IDLE
2) promote all SCHED_IDLE tasks into SCHED_OTHER whenever *any* task is 
waiting on a semaphore.
3) an audit of semaphores for 2.5
I'm quite fond of option 1.
