This is totally wrong in two ways.
Let me fix this, the IOMMU on these machines is per PCI bus, so this
figure should be drastically lower.
Electrically (someone correct me, I'm probably wrong) PCI is limited
to 6 physical plug-in slots I believe, let's say it's 8 to choose an
arbitrary larger number to be safe.
Then we have:
max bytes per bttv: max_gbuffers * max_gbufsize
		    64           * 0x208000      == 133.12MB
133.12MB * 8 PCI slots == ~1.06 GB
Which is still only half of the total IOMMU space available per
controller.
