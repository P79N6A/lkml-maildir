Yup.

This patch looks like it should certainly fix the problem, but that is 
still some god-awful ugly overkill in locking.
I'd rather make the rule be that you have to take the task lock before 
modifying things like the parent pointers (and all the other fundamntal 
pointers), since that's already the rule for most of it anyway.
And then the tasklist lock would go away _entirely_ from /proc (except for
task lookup in ->readdir/->lookup, of course, where it is fundamentally
needed and proper - and will probably some day be replaced by RCU, I
suspect).
