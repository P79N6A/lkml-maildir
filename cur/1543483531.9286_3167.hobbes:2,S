        Hi;)
        I've found strange bug with PPP under Linux:
        1. PPP connections. Modems are: USR Robotics and Multi-master
(tested also both Mul-
timaster modems).
        2. Kernel: 2.0.32 2.0.36 2.2.1
        3. pppd 2.2.0 2.3.5
        What happends: TCP connection's freezing when hex sequence occup:
0x74 0xab 0x2b 0x2b 0x20 (attach included). All other TCP connections
still alive.
Try to up/down loading attached file or via telnet connections type: cat
TEST.
Both cases this tcp connections freezes (but netstat -an shows
ESTABLISHED).
Maybe I'm wrong? I've tryed all software combinations described above on
different
computers. Also I've tryed -bsdcomp -pc asyncmap combinations with pppd.
