So what you're saying is that diff and patch should drag along all the BK
functionality, databases, and so forth.....
%  ls -l /usr/bin/diff /usr/bin/patch
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root        64540 Jun  5 14:57 /usr/bin/diff
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root        83828 Jun  5 22:41 /usr/bin/patch
% man diff | wc -l
    310
% man patch | wc -l
    675
