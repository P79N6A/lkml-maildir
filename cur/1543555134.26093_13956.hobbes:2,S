Reading from port 0x313 (my ISA NE2000 is at 0x300-0x31f) hangs my
machine dead.  Unfortunately, reading from that port is exactly what
the isapnp code does on boot, if compiled into the kernel.
Is it the network card's fault (probably), or is there a less invasive
probe that isapnp could use (unlikely, I guess)?
Tim.
