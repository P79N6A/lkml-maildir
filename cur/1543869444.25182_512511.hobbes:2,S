Alan,
Where do I look in the kernel to see if there is
'driver support' present based upon the card?
As I mentioned as well, the same driver is used
for the PCI Driver (using 6042 chip). So, at some
level, the support is there.
The key is does Linux *Kernel* support for PCI
Express have support for this card? Which goes
back to the initial question - where/how do I
look to see if it does????
thanks Alan for any more insight!
Tom
