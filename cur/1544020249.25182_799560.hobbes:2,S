How many devices actually have the _PS3 method (or whatever it is that we 
end up executing)? We might be able to simply flag it, and say "ok, if we 
have a _PS3 method, we'll have to suspend early, otherwise we can leave it 
for a late suspend".
Definitely not perfect, but perhaps a way to get the safe thing on 99% of 
all cases, and have to live with the horrid ACPI rules on some things.
I thought the _DSW thing is common for setting up wakeup, but _PSx is not. 
But I have not looked at many ACPI tables in my life. I try to active 
avoid it if I at all humanly can.
