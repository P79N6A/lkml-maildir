That leaves the question of what the default behaviour should be.  If
we have to switch to 512Byte in the long run anyway, there is little
point in postponing the pain.  Make it the default, and old behaviour
depends on the flag.
If we can avoid the pain completely, use that better fix instead, even
if it isn't ready before 2.7, and ignore the problem until then.
Can we?
