Fair enough. Reverted.
I think I'll stop accepting any ACPI patches at all that add new features, 
as long as there doesn't seem to be anybody who reacts to bug-reports. We 
don't need ACPI features.
We need somebody who answers when people like Andrew asks about patches to 
support things like memory hotplug (which was also a problem over the last 
weeks). Here's a quote from Andrew from a week or so ago: "repeat seven 
times over three months with zero response.".
It's not worth it to accept new stuff if we know it's not going to get any 
attention ever afterwards.
