looking at the code this no longer looks obvious -- does anyone know what
is the correct definition of totalram_pages? It would be nice if
totalram_pages stood for "total number of RAM pages" but it doesn't
seem to... It seems to be a sum of "low" and "high" pages. Does it include
kernel text/data/init or not?
