	ethtool -i. Unfortunately, not yet implemented in all driver,
but Jeff is on the case.
	There might also be a sysfs way to do it, but it probably
involve lot's a grep or similar magic.

	ifrename allow you to rename interfaces based on both driver
name and PCI address, so another option is to make sure interface
names are consistent and meaningful.
