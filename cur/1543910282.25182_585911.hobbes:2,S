I replaced a HDD in my OFXW911 enclosure and am starting tests now.
While backing ~80 GB from its current reiserfs partition up in order to
reformat to ext3, using find | cpio, I got that error 4 times:
Aug 18 13:24:58 stein ReiserFS: sdd1: Using r5 hash to sort names
Aug 18 13:47:41 stein firewire_sbp2: status write for unknown orb

Aug 18 14:50:08 stein firewire_sbp2: status write for unknown orb
Aug 18 14:50:39 stein firewire_sbp2: sbp2_scsi_abort
Aug 18 14:57:24 stein firewire_sbp2: status write for unknown orb
Aug 18 14:57:54 stein firewire_sbp2: sbp2_scsi_abort
cpio finished with exit code 0, and I compared one of the directories
within which a command was aborted after remounting the disk.  Seems
that error was properly recovered from.
I will test if more of these errors occur in write access or with ext3,
but at least I have a way now to get one error per ~20 minutes
continuous IO, on average.  Then I will proceed to examine the new
stack's sources for potential related bugs.  Will take a while though
because I have other projects going on at the moment.
