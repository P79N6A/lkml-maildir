Hi,
The primary purpose of these patches is to introduce a signed divide,
which is useful for NTP. While I'm at it I cleaned up the API, so it
should be a little easier to use.
It uses a new header <linux/math64.h> for it instead of using
<asm-generic/div64.h>. asm-generic/div64.h has the problem of an
all-or-nothing approach, so any arch not using it has to implement the
whole API and usually it's enough to provide only one of them.
<linux/math64.h> allows to selectively functions as needed.
In the long term we can first depricate using <asm/div64.h> and even
later do_div() completely.
bye, Roman
