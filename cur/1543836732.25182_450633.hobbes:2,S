Open source is all about trust. Person A takes a patch from person B
because person A has trust in B (conditional on the patch meeting a
technical standard). In B's technical ability, in B's intentions, in B's
sincerity, in B's honesty when he says "this is my work and you can use
it because nobody but me has a claim on this".
Using a fake name is not a good way to gain such trust... At all.
Explicitly refusing to say who you really are just lowers the trust even
more, because it gives a strong appearance that something really fishy
is going on. 
Personally I would be extremely hesitant to take any patches from anyone
who refuses to give out his real name. Because trust is about a person.
Because trust means not having to hide things that matter. And a persons
identity does matter for taking patches.
