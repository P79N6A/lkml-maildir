Hi Phillip,
your recent patch "pktcdvd: Allow larger packets" changed 
PACKET_MAX_SIZE in the pktcdvd driver from 32 to 128.
Unfortunately, drivers/block/pktcdvd.c contains the following:
<--  snip  -->
...
static void pkt_start_write(struct pktcdvd_device *pd, struct 
packet_data *pkt)
{
        struct bio *bio;
        struct page *pages[PACKET_MAX_SIZE];
        int offsets[PACKET_MAX_SIZE];
...
<--  snip  -->
With PACKET_MAX_SIZE=128, this allocates more than 1 kB on the stack 
which is not acceptable considering that we might have only 4 kB stack 
altogether.
Please either fix this before 2.6.16 or ask Linus to revert commit 
5c55ac9bbca22ee134408f83de5f2bda3b1b2a53.
TIA
Adrian
