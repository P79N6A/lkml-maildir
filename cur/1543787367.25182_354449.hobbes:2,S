Subject: Re: [RFC][PATCH] identify in_dev_get rcu read-side critical sections
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The original motivation for this patch was in __in_dev_get 
usage.  I'll try to test a build, but should submittals be 
incremental? first addressing in_dev_get, then 
__in_dev_get?  What seems resolved so far follows.
The exchange below suggests that it is equally important 
to have the rcu_dereference() in __in_dev_get(), so the 
idea of the only difference between in_dev_get and 
__in_dev_get being the refcnt may be accepted.
Correct usage may be a question with the mismatched 
definitions (in terms of refcnt) of __in_dev_get() 
and __in_dev_put() that superficially appear 
paired and this may merit a comment.  If interested, 
examples are mentioned in 
www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0509.1/0184.html
and
www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0509.3/0757.html
But when the refcnt is employed for the DEC Alpha, 
rcu-protection or other locking must be in place for 
multiple CPUs, which apparently affirms the value 
of the marking of an rcu read-side critical section 
done by the calling function which has the vision of the 
extent of use of the protected dereference.
Is this all reasonable to you?
Thank you very much.
