Would an above average Unix system suffice?
How about MULTICS?
It's been done for:
    Irix and Trusted Irix
    Solaris and Trusted Solaris
    UNICOS
    HP/UX
    AIX
    SystemV
    Xenix

Rubbish. No privileged software can be installed.
Software that runs as a user without capabilities
can be installed freely. It only requires analysis
if it violates policy, which on a system with
POSIX capabilities means running in possession
of capabilities.

It's been selling in the marketplace for
the past 20 years.

Ah, no. You don't seem to understand the concept.

Probably just as well, all things considered.
