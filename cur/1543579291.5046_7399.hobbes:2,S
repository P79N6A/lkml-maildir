ok i'm spouting lots today sorry! :)
can i just say this solves even more problems?
there's a problem with the current apache pipeline code where if a
pipeline consists of, say, a light request followed by a heavy request. a
"light" request is say, a static file, something that essentially is
served immediately.  a "heavy" request could be a dynamic request which
has to go off and fetch something from a distant database.
the heavy request may take several seconds to get the info and form its
response.  all that time apache is delaying the final packet of the first
light request *hoping* that it'll be able to form a nice big buffer for
the kernel.
with SIOCPUSH and nagle this problem disappears.  apache can make sure to
write() to the kernel at the end of each request, no matter how small.
it will SIOCPUSH the response out if there's nothing more in the pipeline,
otherwise it'll proceed to the next request in the pipeline.  if the next
request is heavy, the kernel will eventually push the last request out
when the nagle timer expires... rather than after several seconds or
whenever the heavy response starts to be written.
damn that's sweet.  now if only i had a portable version of this :)
