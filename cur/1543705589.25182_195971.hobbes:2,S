No, normal mkisofs does not warn, are you sure that your distributor did
not patch it?

Really? Quoting Joerg Schilling:

| 
| Definitely wrong too: Joliet is a half hearted hack on ISO-9660.
| If you like to have large files in ISO-9660 (and/or Joliet!), you would need
| multi extent file support.
| 
| In order to implement this, you need an OS to test with....
| 
| Solaris has no multi extent file support
| 
| Linux fails with several other problems in the vicinity of large files on 
| ISO-9660 and in such a case auto activates evil mount options that prevents
| you from using such media.

Interesting, what should be "multiple extents" then?

I have never seen this warning on mounting "defective" filesystems.
