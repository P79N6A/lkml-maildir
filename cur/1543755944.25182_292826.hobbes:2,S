I wish I had found your patch before I went to the trouble of writing my 
own!  Yours is just as good as mine.

Without rtnl_shlock(), something complains about RTNL not being locked. 
I don't know much beyond that.

Yes, I can see that.  Either way is fine by me.

On the MTU parameter?  Yes, it's network byte order, big-endian.

It's probably better to compare your patch with its apparent successor, 
however.  The tiny DHCP client in the klibc package already supports 
setting the MTU.

A friend of mine just had the misfortune of running into the exact same 
problem, but then he had the fortune of finding your patch.  So at least 
the curse has a temporary remedy. :-)  The long-term solution is klibc, 
I hope.  klibc in initramfs could ease a lot of pain.
