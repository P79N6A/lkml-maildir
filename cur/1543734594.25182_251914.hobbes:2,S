The patch comes at an awkward time - I'd prefer that the leak fix be merged
up immediately, but the rest appears less serious.  And you're playing in
an area which likes to explode in our faces.
Had you not rolled three distinct patches into one (hint) I'd have
forwarded along the leak fix and sat on the rest for post-2.6.9.
What can we do about this?
