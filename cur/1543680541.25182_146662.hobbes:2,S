That was just fun, but OK, I forgot the 'fun' tags... ;-)

Well the original code already had 2 different semantics:
In the MP case it returned the mask of currently allowed CPUs which should 
have been 1 for UP but was 0...
So as the value returned by apm_save_cpus() was only used for apm_restore_cpus
() I optimized it away. Which was just an other change of the semantics...ACK

OK, I see you're right and your actual patch looks better to me because it 
makes the semantics consistent! So come on and let's take it into the 
tree...!
