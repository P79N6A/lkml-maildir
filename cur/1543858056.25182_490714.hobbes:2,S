If sc() is implemented with cmpxchg(), then this is a very silly piece of
code.  cmpxchg() returns the current value if it fails, rendering a repetition
of ll() pointless.  In some circumstances, you should really do it by putting
the cmpxchg() up front with what you expect the most likely substitution to
be, and that then doesn't require the initial load.
