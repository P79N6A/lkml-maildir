Oops; I didn't see that flag. It seems it was added at the same time LUN 
scanning became the default. It would be good to document the 
availability of default_dev_flags in /Documents/scsi.
It appears that the broken RAID systems are based on Maxtronic Arrays, 
such as the Arena Premium 8600. They just released a fixed firmware, so 
the source of the problem should be fixed. (It was also broken for Mac OSX.)
