Stephanie,
All test are GPL, so anyone can do anything they want with them.  We would
be happy to donate test to any project.
The truth is that we modeled test cases after LTP, meaning that a test case
is
a simple executable that returns 0 for success and anything else to indicate
failure, so copying a test from posixtest to LTP should be very easy.
I was under the impression that LTP did not want to accept a bunch of test
cases that did not currently have an associated implementation in Linux.
It sounds like this is not exactly correct.  How about test cases that will
probably
always be implemented in user space?  Isn't LTP specific to kernel testing?
