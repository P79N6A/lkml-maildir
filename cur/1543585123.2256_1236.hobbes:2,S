That is right, UDP is an unreliable transport so it doesn't
matter which packets we drop in such a case.
In fact, the current choice is optimal.  If the problem is that we are
being hit with too many packets too quickly, the most desirable course
of action is the one which requires the least amount of computing
power.  Doing nothing to the receive queue is better than trying to
"dequeue" some of the packets there to allow the new one to be added.
