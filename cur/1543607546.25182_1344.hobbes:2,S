Yes there is, since TASO applications need to wrap at 1<<31, 
not TASK_SIZE.  Note that TASK_SIZE should _not_ be changed
for TASO applications, since they can explicitly map memory
above 4G.  An example here is em86, in which the low 4G is
reserved for the emulated program, and the emulator lives in
high memory.

I think you're working too hard to make this "efficient", and
in the process making the code hard to read.  A subroutine
containing a simple search-forward loop is just as effective.
