On for an initrd, it will never work, since initrd checks for minix, ext2
and romfs only (see drivers/block/rd.c, identify_ramdisk_image()).
BTW: what's with the new initrd scheme (using loading a cpio image into a
tmpfs)? I'm still waiting for this to go into the official kernels
(currently I use my own patch doing the same thing for tar images).
