As I said, I've done all of that. My guess is: it's not a hardware problem, it 
seems to be consistently at exactly the same place every single time.
I have no way of measuring whether my compiler modifies data exactly Nx32Mb 
away...and as I have 192Mb, I don't know if that's even the fault, though I've 
got a K6-II@500MHz (running at 533MHz, more stable that way- keeps behaving 
strangely at 500MHz)
I'm still scratching my head about it, frankly. I finally found my local 
Mandrake kernel source tree, so I'll see if the toolchain even builds that. If 
it doesn't, then I'll have to hunt in other areas for answers.
Cheers, and thanks for your comments.
