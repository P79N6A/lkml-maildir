There are plenty of funnies in the i810 audio (actually mostly the driver
just doesn't seem to want to lie down and behave not such the hardware).
The crackling audio isn't one of the problems seen anywhere.
What AC97 codec is attached to your card, and also does it help if you
turn volume levels down a bit and turn all the recording inputs right off ?
