Humm, as I see it, the choices presented in a make xconfig do not 
allow the choice of the athlon-xp, just the athlon.  Are there any 
worthwhile optimizations the added '-xp' would bring into play?  
Making it enough faster to make that choice a worthwhile choice?
Said another way, what file would I edit after the .config has been 
saved in order to put that into effect for the subsequent build?

Oh?  As that stuff is pretty invisible during a make today, how would 
one go about determining if thats in effect on this machine?
