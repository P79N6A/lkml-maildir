It's Linux's way of saving you money :)

There have been many reports of this happening, but they
are tapering off now.

It's surprising that 2.4.10->2.4.13 actually doubled throughput.

Really?  Are you saying that on a controller which can
do 85 megs/second, you can't read files through the filesystem
at greater than 17?  Which filesystem?

OK, that's normal and proper.  Almost all the kernel time
is spent copying data.

Well...   We seem to have three issues here:
1: Why isn't the controller achieving the manufacturer's
   claimed throughput?
   Don't know.  Maybe it's the software copy.  Maybe it's the
   device driver.  Maybe they lied :).  It'd be interesting
   to test it on the same machine with the vendor's drivers
   and win2k.
2: 0-order allocation failures.
3: Poor `cp' throughput.  This one is strange.  Perhaps
   `cp' is using a small transfer-size and the kernel's
   readhead isn't working properly.  Could you experiment
   with this some more?  For example, what happens with
	dd if=large_file of=/dev/null bs=4096k
