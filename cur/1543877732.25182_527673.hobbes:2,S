My guess is Firewire (IEEE 1394); "F193" on a different system (different
chip vendor) *is* Firewire.  This BIOS seems to have wrongly copied ACPI
tables from a similar system with a fancier southbridge from the same
chip vendor.  (ISTR the vendor's reference design used the fancier chip.)

That's my assumption; yes.   Another system lists "AUD0" and "MODM", but
shows neither as a wakeup device.  As I said, "confused".
