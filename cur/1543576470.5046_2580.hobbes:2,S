Greetings,
Up to and including -test12, tdfx.o has built and run nicely.
Starting with -test13-pre1, and continuing to -test13-pre4,
tdfx.o (and other modules e,g the olympic.o token ring driver)
have not been successfully created. In general, modules work fine,
it's just a few that have been broken byu the makefile changes.
# uname -r
2.4.0-test13-pre4 
# lsmod

However, "modprobe tdfx" yields 34 lines of "unresolved symbol" 
messages and a failure to load the module.
Other info: 
modutils version: 2.3.21
gcc version: egcs-2.91.66
More info on request
Hope this helps direct attention to the problem -
