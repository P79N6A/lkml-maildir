First of all, I put the blktrace and vmstat logs on my webspace because they 
grew too big for the list to handle. :-)

Just let me know once you got them, so I can safely delete them again.
At the moment, I am trying without preemption but for example doing a untar 
kernel sources still results in sluggish system responsiveness. :-(
If I can do anything else, please let me know.
