Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi Linus,
Please pull the 'drm-patches' branch from
ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git drm-patches
Sorry this is so late, after much talking at LCA we decided to pull TTM 
from this round and I had to re-order a lot of things, so highlights of 
this bunch are
intel driver suspend/resume support - can bring back text mode now.
basic radeon r500 CP support
sysfs cleanups.
fix pci_set_master not being called breaking some radeons.
Dave.

    mga_dma: return 'err' not just zero from mga_do_cleanup_dma()
    
    While reading some code I stumbled across the use of 'err' in
    drivers/char/drm/mga_dma.c::mga_do_cleanup_dma() and I think there's a small
    problem.
    
    The variable is only used inside #if __OS_HAS_AGP which is fine, but all that
    ever happens is an assignment to the variable - it is never actually used for
    anything.  The variable is nicely initialized to zero which is also what the
    return statement at the end of function returns (always at the moment).
    
    It looks to me like that function should be returning 'err' instead of always
    just returning 0.  Here's a patch to do that.

    drm: add _DRM_DRIVER flag, and re-order unload.
    
    Allow drivers to addmaps that won't be removed by lastclose or unload.
    The unload needs to be re-ordered to avoid removing the hashs before
    the driver has removed the final maps.

    drm: Fix ioc32 compat layer
    
    Previously any ioctls that weren't explicitly listed in the compat ioctl
    table would fail with ENOTTY.  If the incoming ioctl number is outside the

    This make the fence related ioctls work on 64-bit PowerPC.

    drm: fd.o bug #11895: Only add the AGP base to map offset if the caller didn't.
    
    The i830 and newer intel 2D code adds the AGP base to map offsets already,
    because it wasn't doing the AGP enable which used to set dev->agp->base.

    Add suspend/resume support to the i915 driver.  Moves some of the
