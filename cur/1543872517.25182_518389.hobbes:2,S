hg bisect found the below patch as the culprit, and reverting it does
fix the regression. It's supposed to address "sometime ac/battery update
stops after resume from disk." This thread:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/24/111
 appears to talk about the same issue,
and therefore it may be solved without the below patch, so perhaps we
can all be happy.
Regardless, I think my laptop no longer being able to go into S3 sleep
is a bit more important than someone else's laptop merely not showing
the correct AC status :-).
Please revert. (git patch id ed41dab90eb40ac4911e60406bc653661f0e4ce1)
