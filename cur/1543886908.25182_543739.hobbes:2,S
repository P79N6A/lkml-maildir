Eric, that's complete nonsense.  What Intel documents and what Intel
tests are two very different things.
Intel appears to be afraid of what they call "the crack", but the
semantics of the transition are quite well understood.

A lot of the Intel manuals are boilerplate written by technical writers.
 Once you're used to them you can spot it quite easily because it's
carried from generation to generation with little change, even when it's
blatantly obsoleted.
I can tell you there is tons of production code out there which *never*
reloads CS after switching into and out of protected mode.  It just
plain has to work, on every x86 CPU ever made, with the obvious
semantics.  With Intel's VT, you want to avoid sticking in that mode for
extended periods of time, for performance reasons, but it will work even
there (it kicks to interpreter, though.)  Staying long enough to load
the segment registers is not an issue.
