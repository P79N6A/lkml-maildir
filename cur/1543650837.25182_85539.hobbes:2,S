Oh! Ok, that's exactly like the user-definable ACL groups I was
describing. My mistake, I thought you were suggesting some crazy ACL
symlink like: "Make file foo's ACL be the same as file blah's ACL" and
if I then go and add some untrusted user to blah's ACL it would then
automatically change foo's ACL. That just seemed a bit out there, but it
was just my mis-interpretation. Sorry :)

Eh, as long as the ACLs are per-file, I can't ever accidentally give
access to a file I didn't mean to. The corner cases of "remove my
ex-friend from all my files" could be annoying, but could be done w/ the
equiv of chgrp -r

Hmmm. I'm way out of my realm of competency here. I just know ACLs were
*really* useful w/ AFS. 
I probably should just go read the specs. Anyone have a pointer, or care
to explain what the differences are between AFS's ACLs and POSIX ACLs?
thanks
