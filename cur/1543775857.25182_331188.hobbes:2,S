Ext3 has stronger guaranties than basic filesystem consistency.
I.e. in ordered mode, file data is always written before metadata, so the
worst that could happen is a growing file's new data is written but the
metadata isn't updated before a power failure... so the new writes wouldn't
be seen afterwards.

Thanks for you input!
Is there an option in XFS,ReiserFS,JFS to enable ordered mode?
