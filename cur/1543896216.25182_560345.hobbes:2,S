This was never a bug, and should have been named a warning. It's also gone 
in the current source-tree, since we instead of warning now just return 
ZERO_SIZE_PTR, and if somebody then dereferences that zero-sized 
allocation, then that is the *real* bug.
So I'm sure the patch description is misleading, but I'm not sure whether 
the patch itself is wrong per se. But I'm dropping it for now.
