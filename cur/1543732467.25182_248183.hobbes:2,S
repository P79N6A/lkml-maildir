Hi Sam, I found out what was triggering the problem: symbolic links.
The setup was like this:
directory A contains Makefile, source code etc.
B is a symbolic link to A.
If I change directory into A, then "make clean" works fine.
If I change directory into B, then "make clean" only cleans .tmp_versions.
Strange but true...
All the best,
Duncan.
