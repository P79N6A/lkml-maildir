Morning list
I noticed following problem with recent kernels 2.4.[3-8]. If I use overlay
with my Brooktree card and the window has a certain size, the picture is
broken. After digging through the mailinglist archive I found a fix.
Commenting out pci_fixup_via691_2 in linux-2.4.x/arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c
fixed the problem, overlay was working again. I think the problem is that
pci_fixup_via691_2 is fixing something that isn't broken with my hardware
and therefore breaks it.
I have an "old" Athlon 700 on a Asus K7V mobo with the KX133 chip.
