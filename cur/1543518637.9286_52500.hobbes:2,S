Well, I don't know what touch-typing is.  I ran accross it earlier today
as well.  I do type over 110 words per minute most of the time (save
when coding).  That would be 550 characters per minute.  So, yes, it is
VERY probable, especially in english, for me to press the same key
multiple times per second.  Specifically characters aedt (being some of
the most common in english).
