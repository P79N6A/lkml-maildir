1. In tcp_prequeue, why does the bh queue the packet in the prequeue and 
exits if ucopy.memory < socket's rcvbuf?
What is the relavence between the two?
2. TCP_CHECK_TIMER is a macro which is defined as follows
#define TCP_CHECK_TIMER(sk) do { } while (0);
What is the meaning of this statement? i.e., purpose of this dummy loop.
Your reply will be appreciated.
Thank you.
Anu
