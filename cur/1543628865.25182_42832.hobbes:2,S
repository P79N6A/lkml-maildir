Hiya, 
I tried to install Linux on one of my desktop's and got into a small
icky situation..
The harddrives on this machine are all attached to the HPT370 ata-100
controller.. The internal controller has an cd-r only.
After installing and rebooting with ata100 kernel was shipped with
slackware 8 it worked fine, but after I tried to upgrade the kernel to
2.4.18 it seems not to enjoy my configuration
I'm getting these alot.:
EXT2-fs error (device ide2(33,3)): ext2_write_inode: unable to read inode block - inode=65549, block=131077
and when I do the only cure is to power cycle :(
The Motherboard is an Abit VP6 with VIA chipset... and dual cpu's.
I tested the configuration in win2k and the drive seems fine there.
Reinstalled linux again and voila.. a few of these again :(
Is there some magical kernel parameter that can be set to help out here?
;-) since and older kernel did work.. or is there any patches worth
testing? ;)
Mvh/Best regards,
Arnvid L. Karstad
