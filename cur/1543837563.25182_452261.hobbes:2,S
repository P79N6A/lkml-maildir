For a user it's a "disk" no matter what cable type (SCSI, SATA, USB,
Firewire...) is used for connecting it to the computer. You can even
connect the very same disk to the machine using either SATA/PATA, USB or
Firewire cables depending on the enclosure, so making the naming of
SATA/PATA/USB/etc. disks different is much more confusing.
AFAIR long ago Linus said he'd like just one major number (and thus only
one naming scheme) for every disk in the system; with /dev/sd* we're now
getting there.
