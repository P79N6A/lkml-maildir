There's no technical reason why you couldn't shrink as well. But right now we 
don't have any filesystems that support online shrink, so the tools prevent 
that scenario. Online expand is quite common, though.

Ok.

We had considered that originally. It just seemed like too big of a hack. :) 
Plus I wasn't sure if there were locking issues with changing fields in the 
inode.

So...should I take i_sem or not? :)  Perhaps calling i_size_write() in 
include/linux/fs.h would be preferrable, since it seems to be doing different 
things for SMP and preempt.
Thanks for the feedback!
