Andrew,
	Here is a consolidated readahead patch against mm tree that takes care
of the performance regression seen with multiple threaded writes to the same
file descriptor. 
	The patch does the following:
	1. Instead of calculating the average count of sequential
		access in the read patterns, it calculates the
		average amount of hits in the current window.
	2. This average is used to guide the size of the next current
		window.
	3. Since the field serial_cnt in the ra structure does not
	 	make sense with the introduction of the new logic,
		I have renamed that field as currnt_wnd_hit.
	This patch will help the read patterns that are not neccessarily
sequential but have sufficient locality. However it may regress random
workload. 
	Results:
	1. Berkley Shands has reported great performance with this
		patch.
	2. iozone showed negligible effect on various read patterns.
	3. DSS workload saw neglible change.
	4. Sysbench saw a small improvement.
	I am not sure what good/bad effects this patch will cause
	on other workloads. So can we keep this patch in your tree
	for a while and see which benchmarks scream.
	I have generated this patch w.r.t to 2.6.8-rc4-mm1.
