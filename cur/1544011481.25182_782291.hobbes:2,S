Subject: [PATCH] futex: Cleanup futex_(un)lock_pi fault handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/18/382

Some apparently left over cruft code was complicating the fault logic.  Testing if uval != -EFAULT doesn't have any meaning, get_user() sets ret to either 0 or -EFAULT, there's no need to compare uval, especially not against EFAULT which it will never be.  This patch removes the superfluous test and clarifies the comment blocks.
Build and boot tested on an 8way x86_64 system.
