Then that is probably why it fails, the NMI or any other problem is less 
likely. Please try:
http://www.hojdpunkten.ac.se/054/samba/smbfs-2.4.19-pre9-poll.patch
I haven't tested this particular patch, but it is a re-diff of an old one.
Should be ok with -pre6 too.
You don't need to modify samba, but you do need to enable "SMBFS Receive
timeout" in the kernel config.
