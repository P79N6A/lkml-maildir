hi Frank - sorry about the late reply, was busy with other things. Your
ppc patches look mostly mergeable, with some small details still open:

what is the rationale behind the rt_lock.h changes? The #ifdef
CONFIG_PPC32 changes in generic code are not really acceptable, the -RT
tree tries to keep a single spinlock definition and debugging
primitives, across all architectures.
to drive things forward, i've applied the first 3 patches (except the
rt_lock.h chunk from the first patch), and released it as part of the
40-03 patch:

so that you can send followup patches based on this. Patches #4 and #5
are routed via the upstream PPC tree, so -RT should not carry them,
right?
