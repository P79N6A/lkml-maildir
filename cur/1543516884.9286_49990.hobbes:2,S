Has anyone noticed this problem with the memory zones as well?
Particularly on small-RAM embedded machines
I'm having to do some things that are wrong in the call to free_area_init()
on PPC.  We have to fill out every zone with at least 1<<MAX_ORDER pages
but we have no highmem and all mem is DMA-able on most PPC's so 2 of the 3
areas should be empty on PPC and probably other architectures (but that's
not allowed).
Even worse, we have some 4M RAM embedded machines that will fail (need >=
1<<MAX_ORDER pages of RAM in each zone and have 3 zones).  That means 2M in
each zone so small-mem embedded m68k/x86/strongarm's will probably have
trouble here too since they have will have to have 6M.
A possible partial solution would be to have zone 3 dependent on
CONFIG_HIGHMEM again.  Also, it would be nice if zone 2 could be empty for
cases where all of RAM is DMA-able.
