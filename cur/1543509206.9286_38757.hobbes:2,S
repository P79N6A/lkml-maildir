Not the system, the video card!

I think it is probably possible to infer from the Win98 video mode and resolution
how much ram, at least, is available.  For some chipsets that are supported by
XFree86, certain implementations (specific boards) still confuse it.

Actually I've had very little trouble setting up Win98 with various video cards
and misc. monitors, even generic ones.
Although it can take a little tweaking, the secret seems to be that the video
card's BIOS and/or driver set's some reasonably middle video parameters that seem
to work with typical monitors.  (Of course cheap cards seem to assume cheap
monitors and top of the line cards seem to assume a top of the line video
monitor.)
With XFree86 conversely, I nearly always have to tweak, guess, and play around
with things for a while before I get it right.
Part of my guess is that it's not just the chipset core, but other card details
such as dram/gram/sdram, bus interface, clock chip, etc. that determine what the
appropriate parameters are.  The BIOS/Driver combination know what works well and
XFree86 only has specific data points backed up with generalities.  In other
words, the driver knows that the card in question has cut corners to lower cost,
or something, and that the chipset should be run at no more than X framerate,
etc.  Conversely, a newer card/monitor combination might drastically increase the
speed compared to traditional versions of a chip and XFree86 would by default use
the more conservative configuration.
For things that are accessible, it's a way to get the benefit of the bios/driver
knowledge of what works best into Linux.
