I would agree with the lean and mean, but faster, that's another
question.  Even vesafb at 640x480-8 with ypan and mtrr is 30% faster
than vgacon (And for those of you with vesafb that cannot ypan, try
vgacon with the 'no-scroll' option for a more apple-to-apple
comparison).  And with chipset-specific drivers, it can be as much as 3x
faster than vgacon.
Anyway, my default console is still text mode, even though I'm the
framebuffer maintainer :-)
