Strange. I was just asking. Why would you think I would be silly and
refuse to recognize somebody?

OK, I should have checked there before asking here, probably.

There will be.

I don't object to having some more static ones. Fewer users will need
userspace tools for handling the dev nodes then ;-)
And of course, I'll adapt my patch to grab the assigned ones before
the unknown ones ...

I don't know much about DASD. They allocate block majors dynamically
starting from 255 backwards as far as I know. So, dev nodes need to
be created dynamically, I guess.

Well, Alt-SysRq-S does work; but it obviously misses to sync a number
of filesystems.

Well, I would be astonished if you adopted before we do ;-)
