Because if a serial/keyboard/other-console-input-device interrupt
arrives, from the user hitting the "BREAK" key sequence, you'll have
to enter OBP from a hardware interrupt handler.
Look, this thread is already tiring me, having to explain a lot
of things and not making much useful progress.  So I'll just be
honest and say that I'll go work on other things which need my
time and won't take part in this thread any more.
Take care.
