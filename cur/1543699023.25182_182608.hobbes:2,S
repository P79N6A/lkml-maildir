  I don't follow your thinking here, 2.6.0 is certainly frozen, but I
see no reason this can't be fixed in 2.6 if someone cares to do so. The
amount of code is small, and as long as the interrupt gets serviced by
exactly one CPU I doubt the performance could get worse.
  I don't see ia32 going away, either, unless you see 2.7 in a more
distant timeframe than I do. Looking at the power issue I predict
significant ia32 in laptops, and due to cost issues in desktops and
servers. Also, I suspect that Linux hackers have a much higher
percentage of SMP ia32 machines than the general public, which
encourages enhancements in that area.
