One concern I have about all this is sys_sync() and
umount->sync_inodes_sb().  Those functions _must_ write all inodes and wait
upon the result.  If pdflush is concurrently moving inodes between the
various lists, we'll miss inodes.
I suspect we're wrong already.  Adding more lists won't help.  Possibly
adding some tests for sb->s_syncing in the right place will plug the
problem, but it'll be hard to test and won't do much to clarify things.
An alternative fix is to add locking, which might be acceptable.
