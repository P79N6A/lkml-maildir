It's not an Abit KT7 or similar is it?
I was just helping my dad upgrade a machine based with one of those to 2.4 
today and until we turned off Generic PCI bus-master DMA Support and the 
VIA82CXXX drivers we kept getting the same messages the second the system 
booted up. 
It was rather annoying, as I'm not sure if it was because of this or 
something else, but we ended up with some minor disk corruption mainly 
around /usr/src/linux where I made the mistake of doing a make mrproper 
while it was like this. Went back to 2.2 temporarily and it was fine.
Can dig out/try anything on request.
