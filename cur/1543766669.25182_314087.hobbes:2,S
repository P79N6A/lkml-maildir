And btw, in case you think this flaming here is going to bring you forward
in any way:  it's not.  User mounts and namespace-related changes don't
belong into a lowelevel filesystem driver no matter what.  Whatever way
to handle user-private mount we're going to agree on it's not going to be
inside the fuse code.  So you're really better of stoppign the flaming,
stripping out those bits and help writing down a scheme that you'd want
to see in the VFS so we can see whether it makes sense and is implementable.
