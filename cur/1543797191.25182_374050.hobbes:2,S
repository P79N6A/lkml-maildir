Not especially.  To be accurate, it would have to be bumped every time
a driver is removed from the kernel -- or, more accurately, every time
the in-kernel API changes.  To be useful, such an increment would have
to only happen once a year or so, or else updating the packaging is
too much work.  Currently, the in-kernel API changes every month or
two, which means a driver compatibility serial number would be
inaccurate, futile, or both.
