Writing the partition table would still have to be done with
knowledge of its maximum size (i.e. the need to worry about
maximum partition table size wouldn't go away, just the need to
set a maximum size for every individual component in the table).
A program should write the ASCII representation into a buffer,
testing at that time for overflow.  I certainly wouldn't
recommend:
FILE *f = fopen("/dev/hda", "r+");
fprintf(f, "%u %u %u%c", foo, bar, baz, '\0');
:-)

Are you advocating the use of stupid parsers?

If programs writing the partition table know the amount of disk
allocated to the table they can zero-fill the rest (see above).

I think you are seeing phantom problems where obvious solutions
exist.
Of course you have to stuff the values into native binary formats
eventually.  I'm just talking about on-disk representation,
not in-memory.
On output, you can use the biggest integer size the machine
supports, e.g. %llu, because you wouldn't be able to handle the
partition at all if it was just too big for your machine.  Or you
use bignums and something other than printf(3).  Your attempt
to smear this approach by illogically associating it with C++
operator overloading is ridiculous.
On input, if a value is too big to handle, you just
fprintf(stderr, "Partition too big, tough luck for you!\n");
Or, in the kernel, you refuse to mount it.
Or if you really want to handle big numbers, you use a bignum
package for fdisk.  It's not like there's a magic solution with
_current_ partition tables for handling numbers that are too big.
The current approach to this kind of problem in the kernel is
more or less:
-- Choose a structure which imposes a size limit for every value.
-- When _any_ of those limits overflows, switch to a whole new
   structure.  Implement new code branches, syscalls, etc. as
   needed to handle both old and new versions.
Frankly, that sucks.

The /proc mess exists because people chose N ad hoc output
formats for /proc files.  If they had a consistent format like
s-expressions or one-value-per-file most problems with /proc
would not exist.
I'm just putting my hope in the belief that sooner or later Al Viro
will realize that there's a lot more similarity between the Plan
9 and Lisp/Scheme approaches to simple, architecture-independent
representations than he thinks, and swoop in to clean up this
mess :-).
