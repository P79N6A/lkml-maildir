what we saw during the rhel5 testing was that yes, the machine _was_ OOM
*temporarily*, but if instead of killing the task trying to allocate, we
postponed the killing a few times, it would give other tasks the opportunity
to complete writeout, or free up memory some other way, allowing the
allocating process to succeed shortly afterwards.

Maybe, but it does sound spookily familiar.
The last time Larry's patch got floated to lkml it was met with
"Ah!, but we have new oom killer changes in -git which might solve this".
We tried them. They didn't.
