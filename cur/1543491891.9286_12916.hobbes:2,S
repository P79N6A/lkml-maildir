well, not according to GNU. At least it's documented:
   `true' does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning
"success".  It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where a
successful command is needed, although the shell built-in command `:'
(colon) may be faster.
   Any arguments are ignored, except for a lone `--help' or `--version'
(*note Common options::.).
