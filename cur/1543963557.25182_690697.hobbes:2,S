Well, 'phys_cpu_present_map' of arch/x86/mach-voyager/voyager_smp.c is
only used in arch/x86/mach-voyager/voyager_smp.c, other files under
arch/x86/mach-voyager/ not.
And there's also a global 'phys_cpu_present_map', and is widely used
by files under arch/x86/kernel/.
I check these two 'phys_cpu_present_map''s types, the one used by
arch/x86/kernel/ files is not the one defined in
arch/x86/mach-voyager/voyager_smp.c. So
'arch/x86/mach-voyager/voyager_smp.c::phys_cpu_present_map' should become
static.
Thanks.
