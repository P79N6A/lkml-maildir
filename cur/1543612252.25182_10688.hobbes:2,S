um.  Auditing them all is a big task:
akpm-1:/usr/src/linux-2.4.17-pre4> grep -r del_timer . | wc
    800    2064   48299
akpm-1:/usr/src/linux-2.4.17-pre4> grep -r del_timer_sync . | wc 
     85     245    5384
I tried it, when I was a young man.
One mindset would be to just replace all the del_timer calls
with del_timer_sync by default, and to then look for the below
deadlock pattern.   But if you do this, Alexey shouts at you,
because his code actually gets del_timer right, by looking at
its return value.
I'd urge you to reconsider.  We have a *lot* of timer deletion
races in Linux, and squashing them all in one patch just isn't
feasible.

Nope.  The deadlock is where the caller of del_timer_sync holds
some lock which would prevent the completion of the timer handler.
It happens, and is sometimes subtle.
drivers/video/txfxfb.c is an unsubtle example.
