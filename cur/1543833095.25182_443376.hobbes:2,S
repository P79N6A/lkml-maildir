I see your point, but here's where I'm still uncertain:
If you have a lazy write policy, what exactly is gained by intentionally
delaying writes (beyond a certain size that is necessary to make things
like dancing trees actually effecient)?  If you trickle some data to
disk, then when memory pressure causes (or an app calls) a big sync,
then you have less to actually write.  What I'm suggesting, now, is not
a major write policy change, but rather a light process that is limited
to extremely low resource use (I/O, CPU, etc.).  It would take some of
the edge off of major syncs, and for many (most?) non-server users, it
could wholly eliminate memory pressure-induced heavy syncs.
