I would suggest to include the comment based linux document boiler plates
into that coding style recommendation. In that case it is clear, how you can
document the parameters of a function.
/**
 * foo: - do a foo job
 * @parameterbar: the bar parameter is used to bar
 *
 * Description: This is the long description of the function foo() which
 *   is closely related to bar()
 * section header: section description
 **/
int foo(long bar, long baz, struct magic *xyzzy)
(I am not sure about the section, and it most likely is helpful to include a
comment, that not all functions should be documented that way.
I realy think it is important to have at least a pointer from the coding
style document to the doc-comments.
Greetings
Bernd
