Don't know, sorry.  Your config works ok here (well, gets a lot further).
It's dying quite late in boot there - the page allocator has already been
used a bit, but then it falls over in a heap.
I notice you're set up for an i386.  Is the target CPU really an i386?  If
not, and if you change this, does it affect anything?
