Does it really reduce the wakeup's or only change who gets charged by powertop?
The system is going to wakeup once a second anyway. Looks to me that if the
timer is using round_jiffies(), that setting deferrable just changes the accounting.
My interpretation of the api is:
   * round_jiffies()  - timer wants to wakeup but isn't precise about when so schedule
                        on next second when system will wake up anyway;
                        e.g why meetings are usually scheduled on the hour
   * deferrable       - timer doesn't have to really wakeup but wants to happen near
                        a particular time. e.g. "I'll meet you at the pub around 8pm"
Therefore doing deferrable is unnecessary for timers using round_jiffies unless system
is so good at doing timers that it is going to skip doing timer once per second.
