One of the current issues with anonymous pages is the accounting when 
they become file backed and get dirty. There are performance issue with 
swap writeout because we are not doing it in file order and on a page by 
page basis.
Do ramfs pages count as memory backed?

Well COW sortof does that but then its a new page.
