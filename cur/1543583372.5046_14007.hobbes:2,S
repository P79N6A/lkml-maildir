And disadvantages: you can't have broken symlinks.
This actually turns out to be quite a bit of a problem when one tries
to use bind mounts with autofs. For one thing, it's perfectly legal
to have /autofs/foo as a symlink to /autofs/bar/foo, where /autofs/bar
is not yet mounted -- but a bind mount can't handle that...
