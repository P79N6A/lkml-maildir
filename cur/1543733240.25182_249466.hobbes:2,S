And, interestingly, the only user of the result of set_page_dirty() is
redirty_page_for_writepage(), whose results are ignored by all callers.
It appears that something is amiss here, as failed reservations aren't
reported until something attempts background writeback or IO syscalls.
That is, it would seem that checking the results of set_page_dirty(),
also called in the MS_ASYNC case, suffices, however, it does not return
useful results in most (all?) cases, and nothing now checks its result.
The calling convention looks very very odd also; filemap_fdatawait() is
the only apparent way to extract an ENOSPC result without calling the
->writepage() method directly, and this, instead of checking for things
returning -ENOSPC as one would expect, does a rather odd thing, that is
test_and_clear_bit(AS_ENOSPC, &mapping->flags), which will lose all but
one of the results whenever there are multiple concurrent callers of it
on a single inode. Worse yet, that can be legitimate, particularly when
multiple tasks concurrently msync() disjoint subsets of a file's data.
