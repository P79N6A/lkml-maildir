| # This patch includes the following deltas:
| #	           ChangeSet	1.823   -> 1.824
| #	include/linux/sysctl.h	1.30    -> 1.31
| #	     kernel/sysctl.c	1.31    -> 1.32
| #	           fs/exec.c	1.49    -> 1.50
a additional patch to linux/Documentation/{core|dump}.txt (e.g.)
or Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt sure would be nice.  :)
