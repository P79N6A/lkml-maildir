So slub_debug as a boot parameter is not enough.

Oh. No worry. By default slub puts its free pointer in the most dangerous 
area. In my experience it will bug immediately if there is something 
wrong. The mode of operations that I had in mind for development was to 
run until we crash somewhere. Then reboot with slub_debug to get the 
lovely report on who did it.

Hummm..... I need to think about this one.

Doing so will impair performance testing. Memory use will be changed due 
to the growth of all the objects etc etc. Generally I think running 
with slub_debug by default is overkill. 
Having said that you can do even more if you would run
slabinfo -v
to validate object from cron. That way you can check up on all slab 
objects.
