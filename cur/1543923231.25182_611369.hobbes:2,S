Yes, the patch works well on my Dell, and I've got several
follow-up patches to Brad's.  During the last i8k refresh
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/2/24/11

into mainline, so i8k is due for another facelift.
Needs the following in order to work correctly on my Inspiron E1705:
Add DMI Product name to i8k for Dell MP061 hardware (Inspiron 9400/E1705)
