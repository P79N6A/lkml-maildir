Sorry, but I don't see your point here...
You want to be able to restrict the access to a network card on the
basis of the MAC address ?
But, why don't you consider using the socket_create (and more generally,
the socket_* family) in place of adding new hooks ?
The point of a hook is to insert check-points to prevent people to
access features/data on the system. I hardly see the mac layer as a
feature/data by itself as it is part of "can I access network or not ?".
I might as well have missed your point, respected Sir (may I call you
respected Sir ?). :)
