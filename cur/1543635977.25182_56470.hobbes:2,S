unless you call pthread routines during the workload, pthreads cannot be
the reason for a slowdown.
Also I would suggest Andrew to benchmark 2.4.19rc1aa2 against 2.5
instead of plain rc1 just to be sure to compare apples to apples.
(rc1aa2 should also be faster than pre8aa2)
BTW, Lincol, I still have a pending answer for you, about the mmap
slowdown, that's because of reduced readahead mostly, you can tune it
with page-cluster sysctl, it's not only because of the expensive page
faults that mmap I/O implies. I've some revolutionary idea about
replacing readahead, not that it matters for your workload that is
reading physically contigous though.
