The review history goes something like this.
- That's a big patch why are you touching autofs and autofs4 at the
  same time?
<split>
- Hmm.  That change in the autofs4 patch looks fishy.
<patch postponed until the issue was addressed>
autofs4 uses pids more extensively than autofs and so the change is
correspondingly larger.
If you would like to look at what it would take to get autofs4 to only
store values as struct pid * instead of storing pid_t that would be great.
But for the most part I this is a massive global change that those of us
pushing it are responsible for changing as fixing up as much of the code
as we can, as is usual kernel practice.
