Subject: How to do -nostdinc?

There are two ways of setting the -nostdinc flag in the kernel Makefile :-
(1) -nostdinc $(shell $(CC) -print-search-dirs | sed -ne 's/install: \(.*\)/-I \1include/gp')
(2) -nostdinc -iwithprefix include
The first format breaks with non-English locales, however the fix is trivial.
(1a) -nostdinc $(shell LANG=C $(CC) -print-search-dirs | sed -ne 's/install: \(.*\)/-I \1include/gp')
The second format is simpler but there have been reports that it does
not work with some versions of gcc.  I have been unable to find a
definitive statement about which versions of gcc fail and whether the
problem has been fixed.  Anybody care to provide a definitive
statement?
If kernel build cannot rely on gcc working with -nostdinc -iwithprefix include
then we need to convert to (1a).
