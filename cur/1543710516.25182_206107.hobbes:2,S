That's not entirely true. Whether it's feasible depends on how the
MMU is used. The HPW (Hardware Pagetable Walker) and short mode of the
VHPT insist upon pagesize being a per-region attribute, where regions
are something like 60-bit areas of virtualspace, which is likely what
they're referring to. The VHPT in long mode should be capable of
arbitrary virtual placement (modulo alignment of course).
