by 'kernel virtual addresses' you do not mean the vmalloc() area
exclusively, correct?
Also, in my pagecache-in-highmem patches i've already got rid of the
notion of storing virtual addresses in kiobufs, now it's only a 'struct
page *' array instead of a virtual-address array. (will send it to you in
a minute so you can see what i mean and we can sync up)

great!
