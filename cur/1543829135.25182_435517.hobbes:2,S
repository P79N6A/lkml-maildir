Could we have a changelog for this patch?  A list of
what-i-changed-since-last-time bullet points is uninteresting and unuseful
for the permanent record.  Think in terms of some random person in
Barcelona who is trying to work upon your code two years hence.
The patch should be accompanied by a standalone description of what it
does, why it does it and how it does it, thanks.

Need a comment: what's VM_PFNMAP doing in there.

See, this is an incompatible change.  We used to have
	if (unlikely((vma->vm_flags & (VM_SHARED|VM_WRITE)) ==
			(VM_SHARED|VM_WRITE))) {
in there, only now it has secretly started looking at VM_PFNMAP.

Is there really no simpler way?

Needs changelogging, please.
Performance testing is critical here.  I think some was done, but I don't
reall what tests were performed, nor do I remember the results.  Without such
info it's not possible to make a go/no-go decision.
