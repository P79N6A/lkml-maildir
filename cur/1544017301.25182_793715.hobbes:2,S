I'm not seeing this with firefox over here.
The setup I have is the latest beta,
located in /usr/lib/firefox/ with a soft link to /usr/bin/
I don't have gnome2 vfs installed though.
just a bare firefox with 2 plugins(flash,null)
located in /.mozilla/plugins/
for restorecon.
not sure what distro you have, but with ubuntu
I noticed a quit a bit of other links created.
that is installing through apt-get, rather
just downloading the source and putting it wherever.
