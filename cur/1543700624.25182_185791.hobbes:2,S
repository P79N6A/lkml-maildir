Hi all,
i found very useful changing some of the tunable parameters defined in 
kernel/sched.c,
it would be really useful to be able to change these parameters in 
runtime, 
i seen these parameters are been changed from variables to defines in 2.6,
so i ask the kernel coders, is this technically possible in 2.6 ?
Regards, Giacomo Di Ciocco.
