Remember, the sample is biased, the hackers who'd like to hack it are
less likely to buy it, and some might be only making private changes
to avoid legal hassles.
And then, it doesn't have to be all that much.  Since you're talking
specifically about TiVo customers, how much has TiVo effectly
contributed in terms of code?  (It was pointed out before, I know, but
it's important to keep this in perspective, lest people lose sight of
what's at stake)

Only the earliest that you can't find for sale any more, right?

Well, then...  What's the point *for* tivoization, again?  To slow
down the contributions?  And that's good because...?
