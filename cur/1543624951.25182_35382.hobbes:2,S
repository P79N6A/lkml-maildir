I forget what an extremist you are. My claim is that
some processes benefit from big pages, some do not.
A 16G process needs 2^25 bytes of PTE at 4kbytes/page if I
did the numbers right. Just populating 4 million odd  page tables is a 
pain. I might be wrong about it, but I wonder if just scaling
up from a working 32 bit strategy gets you anywhere.
If you want to optimize for gnome, you get a very different
layout. But Hammer and ia64 are supposedly designed for huge
databases, routing tables, and images. Our good friends at Intel
claim "carrier grade" Linux  needs to run threaded apps
with 10,000 threads to depose Solaris in telecom - all sharing the
same monster address space.

What's the "common case" for 64 bit ? Do you really think it will
be on desktop soon?

sounds like it from what Andi wrote. disappointing.
