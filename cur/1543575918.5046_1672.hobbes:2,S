   This one breaks all archs but i386 and alpha. If some arch maintainer likes me
   to update its arch blindly implementing mm_arch structure as an `unsigned long
   context' and fixing up the miscompilation I will do.
Can you name the mm_struct member "context" still instead of
"mm_arch"?  Because many ports will simply:
typedef unsigned long mm_arch_t;
Then all the code changes will make the accesses look less
meaningful.  Consider:
	if (CTX_VALID(mm->mm_arch))
whereas before the code said:
	if (CTX_VALID(mm->context))
which tells the reader lot more.  In fact, retaining the "context" member
name allows most ports to operate with only one change, creating
the asm/mm_arch.h header.  You can in fact do this for all ports
which care about MMU tlb contexts (a simple grep such as
egrep -e "m->context" `find . -type f -name "*.[ch]"`
will show you which ports care).
