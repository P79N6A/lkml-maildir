It's excuses like this that have allowed this crap to endure for so long 
without getting fixed.  What patch do you have for these files that is 
conflicting?  I haven't seen any proposed patches for these two files in 
a long time, and BK only shows one minor change in the last 6 months, so 
I didn't feel that I was going to step on anyone's toes with this patch.
