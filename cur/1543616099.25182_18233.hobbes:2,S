NO; the standard here is clear: any access to a volatile object is a side
effect (see , and optimization is NOT allowed to eliminate side effects, and
must do them respecting sequence points, even if it determines that the code
will in fact do nothing (see 5.1.2.3, at least in the document I have which
one of the last draft, dated 18th January 1999). That's the whole point of
the volatile specifier.
