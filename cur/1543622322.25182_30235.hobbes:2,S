Well, I'm assuming the 41 MHz clocked bus is not a 66-MHz type PCI bus
(doesn't have the 66 MHz bit set and can't operate at 20.5 MHz if you
plug in a card that can't do 66 MHz operation), rather it's an
overclocked 33 MHz bus.
And running PCI over 33 MHz isn't legal in the PCI spec as far as I
know. You can go lower, but I think the limit is 16 MHz there.
