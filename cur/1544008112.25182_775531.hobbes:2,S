Who is the f*cking MORON that thinks that "documentation" has any meaning 
what-so-ever?
The fact that something is documented (whether correctly or not) has 
absolutely _zero_ impact on anything at all. What makes something an ABI 
is that it's useful and available. The only way something isn't an ABI is 
by _explicitly_ making sure that it's not available even by mistake in a 
stable form for binary use.
Example: kernel internal data structures and function calls. We make sure 
that you simply _cannot_ make a binary that works across kernel versions. 
That is the only way for an ABI to not form.
