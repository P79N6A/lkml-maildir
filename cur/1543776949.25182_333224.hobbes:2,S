You should /never/ give access just by inode, as that makes it very easy to
bypass security given by directory permissions.

And what the heck the format of the metadata is today/for this particular
file.

The only characters that aren't used in filenames today are '/' and '\0'.

And if I try to create a file or directory called metas?

Think a GUI that reads the directory to find out what is available and
present them as icons for mousing around. Then there is no way to futz
around with your metadata.
Think filename completion, bash style. No, not just bash uses this.
