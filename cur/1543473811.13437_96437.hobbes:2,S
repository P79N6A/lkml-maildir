Now that's simply unfair.  Is this truely your impression of what
GGI is all about?  Or KGI?  KGI simply tries to provide a way to
keep acceleration OUT of kernel land, and into userland via GGI (or
more appropriately GGI's extension libraries).
Linus, your words carry too much weight to be spreading FUD.
