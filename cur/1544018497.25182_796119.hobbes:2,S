I don't know how that solves the problem. Task with memory policy A
allocates an object, which allocates the "fast" page with policy A
and allocates an object. Then context switch to task with memory
policy B which allocates another object, which is taken from the page
allocated with policy A. Right?
(OK this doesn't give the wrong policy 100% of the time; I thought
there could have been a context switch race during page allocation
that would result in 100% incorrect, but anyway it could still be
significantly incorrect couldn't it?)

I am trying to respond to what you raise. "The" issue I thought you
raised above was that SLQB would grow freelists unbounded
 "the first cpu will consume more and more memory from the page allocator
  whereas the second will build up huge per cpu lists"
And this is wrong. There is another possible issue where every single
object on the freelist might come from a different (and otherwise free)
page, and thus eg 100 8 byte objects might consume 400K.
That's not an invalid concern, but I think it will be quite rare, and
the periodic queue trimming should naturally help this because it will
cycle out those objects and if new allocations are needed, they will
come from new pages which can be packed more densely.

So no response to my asking where the TLB improvement in SLUB helps,
or where queueing hurts? You complain about not being able to reproduce
Intel's OLTP problem, and yet you won't even _say_ what the problems
are for SLQB. Wheras Intel at least puts a lot of effort into running
tests and helping to analyse things.

Cool, I didn't realise it had hooks to do runtime resizing. The more
important issue of course is the one of extra cache footprint and
metadata in SLAB's scheme.
