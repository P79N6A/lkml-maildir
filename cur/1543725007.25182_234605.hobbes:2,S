Hi!
I had sent you an email about your Employee Benefits Program.
Did you get a chance to review it?
I would like to set up a time to talk about how to reduce the cost of
employee benefits, while you expand your benefits to attract and keep key
employees.
When is a good time to talk?
I would like to do a free analysis of your current benefits.
