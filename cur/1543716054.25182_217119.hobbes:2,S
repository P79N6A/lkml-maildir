Russell King is working on a lot of things for the MMU code in ARM.
I'm waiting to see where he ends up.  I believe he's planning on
removing the lazy PTE release logic.
I hacked at it for some time.  And I'm convinced that I correctly
forced the TLBs to be flushed.  Still, I was never able to get the
system to behave.
Now, I just read a comment you or WLI made about the page cache
use-once logic.  I wonder if that's the real culprit?  As I wrote to
Andrew Morton, the kernel seems to be assigning an awful lot of value
to page cache pages that are used once (or twice?).  I know that it
would be expensive to perform an HTG aging algorithm where the head of
the LRU list is really LRU.  Does your patch pursue this line of
thought?
