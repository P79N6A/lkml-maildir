No idea about that.
I think that you still didn't answer my question, or maybe I
didn't ask it well enough.  What device are you having problems
with? I don't mean what chipset, I mean what device that you
touch...

I don't see a way to know that currently.  It could be added
somehow if it's really required.  So far I haven't seen a full
problem description or requirement for this.
