thanks...i looked at the 1220 datasheet and it seems the chip is sane enough
so no special case like the 1250 is needed. the 1210 should be just the same but
with only one slot.

nice to hear it works.

mfunc0 is inta, mfunc1 is irq9, mfunc2 is activity led, mfunc3 is irq7,
mfunc4 GPI3, mfunc5 is the other led, mfunc6 is irq12...
this would give you irq7,9,12 but device control says parallel PCI only..

that's just an uninitialized ti1410. so we're using PCI
