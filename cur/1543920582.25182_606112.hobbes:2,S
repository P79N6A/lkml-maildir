If one of the maintainers, Vivek Goyal or Haren Myneni, cared
to improve the kdump list of files, I'd happily accept it.
My maintainer entry for kdump is:
KDUMP

M:	vgoyal@in.ibm.com
P:	Haren Myneni
M:	hbabu@us.ibm.com
L:	kexec@lists.infradead.org
L:	linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
W:	
http://lse.sourceforge.net/kdump/
S:	Maintained
F:	Documentation/kdump
and if Eric Biederman wants to improve kexec:
KEXEC
P:	Eric Biederman
M:	ebiederm@xmission.com
W:	
http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/
