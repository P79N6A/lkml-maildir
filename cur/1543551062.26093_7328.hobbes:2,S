Near the test3-4 kernel, I was not able to reach www.linuxtoday.com.
After some debug, I find that is because my linux box is emitting syn packet
with some really strange options (description of packet follows).
Can anyone tell me if this behaviour is normal or not ?
Here is the dialog from linuxtoday.
18:55:09.979659 eth0 > x.x.x.5.45762 > 63.236.72.248.www: S [ECN-Echo,CWR]

82580514:4082580514(0) win 5840 <mss 1460,sackOK,timestamp 27634996
0,nop,wscale
 0> (DF)
18:55:10.166933 eth0 < 63.236.72.248.www > x.x.x.5.45762: R 0:0(0) ack

0515 win 5840 <mss 1460,sackOK,timestamp 27634996 0,nop,wscale 0>
It goes on like this a few times but it's not really useful.
The packet is syn and the response is rst.
I suspect the server/firewall/router to dislike the option of the packet.
By the way this connection works perfectly with a windows server and a
linux2.2 box.
This problem is happening with other sites like www.sun.com, www.ibm.com,
www.intel.com.
PLEASE HELP !!!
