I am glad that somebody gets it.

Which brings us right back to where we started.
* Find all users of notifier_chain_register() and change them to the
  new API.
* If any of the calls to notifier_chain_register() are in service
  routines then add a new parameter to the service routine to pass in
  the module owner.  There are several service routines that do this,
  especially in the network code.
* Find all callers of all the modified service routines and change them
  to use the new API for these service routines.
* Repeat until you have propagated the new API all the way out to the
  end points, to the only code that knows the module owner.
Not in 2.4 thanks.
