Subject: struct pci_bus, no release() function?

At probe time, pci_scan_bus_parented() allocates and registers a struct
device for each PCI bus it scans.  This generic device structure never
gets assigned a "release" function.  
Attempts to unregister such a PCI Bus at runtime result in a kernel
message like:
Device 'pci0001:00' does not have a release() function, it is broken and
must be fixed.
Are architectures free to assign their own release function for
"devices" associated with struct pci_bus?  If so, does this have to
happen at boot, or can it happen right before the remove?
Thanks-
John
