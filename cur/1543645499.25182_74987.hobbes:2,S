Hello,
I have found that cdrecord 1.11a34 has stopped working on linux kernel 
2.5.38+. I have a SONY CRX185E3 ATAPI burner and it works fine on 2.4.19 
using "hdd=ide-scsi" kernel parameter, but with kernel 2.5.38+, cdrecord 
fails when trying to access the "/dev/pg*" device files. When I run cdrecord 
-scanbus, it complains with:
cdrecord: No such file or directory. Cannot open '/dev/pg*'. Cannot open 
SCSI driver.
I'm logged on as root. SCSI support is enabled as loadable modules (both the 
IDE-SCSI and SCSI generic support), as well as IDE CD-ROM. The "sg.o", 
"ide-scsi.o" and "scsi_mod.o" modules are loaded and I have used the 
"hdd=ide-scsi" kernel parameter. Also, on /var/log/messages, an entry 
reports problem locating char-major-97. I have a QDI Platinix P4 Motherboard 
with Intel 845 chipset.
Is this a known issue? Also, when running 2.5.38+, why is my computer's box 
IDE led activity continuously lit? On 2.4.19, it only lits when there is 
disk/CD-ROM activity, but on 2.5.38+ it's kept always lit...
Sincerely,
   Felipe Alfaro
