Actually I looked both at the struct and at the slab alignment just in
case it was changed recently. Now after reading your mail I also
compiled it just in case.

Not a big deal sure to grow it 33%, it's so small anyway, but I don't
see the point in growing it. sort() can be interrupted by signals, and
until it can we can cap it to 512 vmas making the worst case taking
dozen usecs, I fail to see what you have against sort().
Again: if a vma bitflag + global lock could have avoided sort and run
O(N) instead of current O(N*log(N)) I would have done that
immediately, infact I was in the process of doing it when you posted
the followup. Nothing personal here, just staying technical. Hope you
too.
