So my patch helped. From what you report it just sounds like you have a
really buggy X server overall. For your matrox mystique try the matrox
fbdev driver with XF86_Fbdev. I use this and haven't any problems under
2.2.X and 2.4.X. In fact I had problems running XSVGA with matroxfb but
when I switched to XF86_Fbdev everything was all better.

The problems with my patch where only related to console switches. Your X
server has problems all around. I have just begun to examine the XFree86
code in detail to understand it. All 230 Megs of it :-(  
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
