I teased 2 gallons of latex primer out of the cans, making it jump up 
onto some outbuildings, so I'm a bit late with the report, which is 
that it spit out a whole flurry of scheduleing while atomic messages 
when I tried it just now, and finally hung, requiring I exersize the 
reset button long before it got to rc.sysinit.  The best I could do 
might be a screen snapshot, but I haven't figured out howto shut the 
flippin flash off and use the available light, or try and scribble it 
all down.  And that would lead to violent deaths if I was a doctor 
trying to write prescriptions. :-( 
As an experiment to see if I could lay bleeding edge, I bled. :)
