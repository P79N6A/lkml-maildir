Hi Linus,
Here is a fix for a ugly race condition that occurs in wake_futex(). The
failure was detected on IA64 but may also occur on other architectures.
On IA64, locks are released using a "st.rel" instruction. This ensures that
preceding "stores" are visible before the lock is released but does NOT prevent
a "store" that follows the "st.rel" from becoming visible before the "st.rel".
The failure I saw is a task that owned a futex_q resumed prematurely and
was context-switch off of the cpu. The task's switch_stack occupied the same
space as the futex_q. The store to q->lock_ptr in futex_wait()overwrote the 
ar.bspstore in the switch_stack. When the task resumed, it ran with a corrupted 
ar.bspstore.  Things went downhill from there.
Without the fix, the application fails roughly every 10 minutes. With
the fix, it ran over 16 hours without a failure.
----
Fix a memory ordering problem that occurs on IA64. The "store" to q->lock_ptr
in wake_futex() can become visible before wake_up_all() clears the lock in the
futex_q.
