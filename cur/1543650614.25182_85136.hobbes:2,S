Temporary addresses are generated (on most links) but not used by default 
(latter is done by source address selection) by my patch.  
Set sysctl net.ipv6.conf.ethXX.use_tempaddr > 1 to use it by default.
(I have per-application setsockopt interface but it is not included 
 because patch for source address selection is not accepted at this moment.)
