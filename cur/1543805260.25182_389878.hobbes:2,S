Hi,
About TCP fast retransmit/recovery, it is described in RFC 2581:
1) When the third duplicate ACK is received, set ssthresh to no more
than the value max(FlightSize/2, 2*SMSS).
2) Retransmit the lost segment and set cwnd to ssthresh plus 3*SMSS.
However, in kernel 2.4.31 (or 2.6.15), cwnd is always set to 1 (in
tcp_enter_loss()), even there is only one packet is drop.
Does anyone know the reason?
Regards,
