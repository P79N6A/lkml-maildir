Randy, I'm testing right now the V7 of the driver after fixing all
your mistakes found. Thank you for your deep work: the sharing of the
buffer was a very good point. Finally I allocated both 2 (the bigger
and the smaller one at the initialization).
In a few minutes I will send the V7 patch.

Well, I can rename it, but there is a problem:
How should I write the name in other places?
I mean, for example, in Kconfig:
	tristate "KS0108 LCD Controller"
if the ks0108 is a LCD controller, then
	tristate "CFAG12864B LCD Display"
should be the right way to write it?
	tristate "CFAG12864B LCDisplay"
seems so ugly to me. Is it? Remember, this applies for all the other
places in the documentation / source code / ...
IMHO it seems better as LCD Display. Yeah, drivers/lcdisplay/ would be
nice, but I don't think the same about other places:
LCD Controller.
LCDisplay??
