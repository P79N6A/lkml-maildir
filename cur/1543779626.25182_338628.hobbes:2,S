Hi Guys/Gals,
	I watched some commercials and I almost puked when I looked at the
Microsoft Get the Facts for Linux vs Windows Server stuff.
They have a url which is 
http://www.microsoft.com/getthefacts
Is this crap any close to real or by any chance "realistic" ? Are these
"benchmarks" simple marketing?
.Alejandro
