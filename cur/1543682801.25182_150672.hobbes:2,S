Hi,
I am facing a lot of problems in trying to get the physical address(actually 
bus address) from of page.
The most obvious answer, virt_to_bus(kmap(page)) seems to work for pages 
that are NOT  in high memory.
For pages in high memory, I have read up a lot of documentation, and mailing 
list questions, but the only thing that seems to work for me is,
(page-mem_map)<<PAGE_SHIFT
Now, the mail i got this from says that this would work only when  mem_map 
[] starts at zero.
I am pretty confused here, this seems to be a obvious problem, why does 
Linux not have a pretty macro or function that would work in all situations?
PS. please cc me in any answers, as I am not subscribed to this list.
Thanks
sumanesh
