hm, you might need to do some special-casing around that function.

We did that because gcc 3.3 (iirc) was utterly buggered.  I forget what it
was doing exactly - generating out-of-line copies in various compilation
units, using more stack space as a result.  That workaround shrunk typical
x86 kernels by ~64k.
If recent gcc's have a -fdont-be-so-damn-stupid option we could use that.
