This has usually been caused by a screwup on patching on my part: A new
file is in the patch, and I apply the patch over the patched kernel, or one
that has a copy of the file from an extraofficial patch, etc. Result: The
contents of the file are duplicated, for no end of fun.
Start again with a clean tarball, use linux/scripts/patch-kernel for doing
the patching.
Good luck!
