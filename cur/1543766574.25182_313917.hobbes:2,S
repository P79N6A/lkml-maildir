The comment above this function specifically says no code is generated
here - the purpose of this function is to generate an error if the
journal superblock is the wrong size (e.g. someone adds fields without
updating the padding).

Looks to be debugging only, seems OK to remove.

I'm not aware of any current users of journal_check_used_features(), but
the complementary function journal_check_available_features() IS used by
ext3 and I can imagine that if we ever need to add some more journaling
features it would be useful instead of mucking in the journal internals.

Looks like the correct API is actually journal_load() so it seems OK to
unexport.
