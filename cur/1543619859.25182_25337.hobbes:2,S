generally we do not make any distinction between Linux threads that share
or do not share their VM. We certainly do not want to handle them
differently wrt. timeslices distributed.

the problem of lower priority tasks taking away CPU time from a higher
priority task is not new, it's present in the old scheduler as well. In no
way is this symptom related to threads that share their VM. The same
workload with forked processes will show the same symptoms.
i'd suggest to do the following tunings on stock -J9:
 - increase HZ to 1024, in include/asm/param.h
 - decrease MIN_TIMESLICE to 1 msec in sched.h.
 - decrease PRIO_BONUS_RATIO from 70 to 40.
these changes do two things: they decrease the timeslice of nice +19 tasks
(pretty dramatically, relative to current kernels), and they make sure
that heavily reniced tasks cannot reach interactive status easily.
do you still see higher priority CPU-bound task starving?

this in essence punishes threads that share their VM - including system
threads such as eg. kswapd or bdflush as well. This concept is broken
because the problem is not that the threads share their VM, that is just a
property of your particular workload. The problem is that while you have
lowered the priority of your java threads, they still show interactive
behavior and get a higher proportion of the CPU share they got previously.
i think your workload shows a weakness in the current handling of reniced
workloads, which can be fixed without adding any new mechanizm.

please also try the tunings i suggested, and compare the two kernels.
