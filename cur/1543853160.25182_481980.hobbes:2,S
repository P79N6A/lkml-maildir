I tried again, applying your patch after applying Linus' one (commit 
933cd864a5c95c296844493b65d868b7cf7548aa in Linus git). Nothing. Only
the first function of the card is discovered. 
I was trying to read the code, and I cannot find where the code in
socket_sysfs.c is supposed to loop over the various functions of the
card. Maybe there could be some problem there?
I would really like to help on this. My modem is dead from 1.6.13...
