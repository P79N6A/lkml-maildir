Note that culprit wasn't the slot that shares an irq with the highpoint
controllers (HPT370 on this board). We knew to avoid that slow from the
beginning (I have a BP6 at home), but I think we tried slot 5 out of
interest after we had verified slot 3 works. I think slot 5 showed the
problem as well - Jani?
Anyhow, we were more puzzled as to how the VIA USB controller, that is
disabled in both BIOS and kernel config can cause these problems. Or is
there something else wrong with the board's pci routing?
As regards to BP6, I find it bearably stable after upgrading to latest bios
ages ago (was it RU or what that solved the lock up issue).  It still locks
up once or twice a month - which I can live with.  But I digress.
