These macros have already been replaced in the synclink drivers.

No, the current situation is generic HDLC support is
an optional configuration for the synclink drivers.
The build option of generic HDLC must match that
of the synclink driver if that option is enabled.
if synclink is 'y' with generic HDLC option enabled,
then the generic HDLC module must be 'y'
if synclink is 'm' with generic HDLC option enabled,
then generic HDLC can be 'y' or 'm'
if synclink is 'y' or 'm' without the generic HDLC option,
then it is not necessary to build/load the generic HDLC module

The Kconfig addition of 'select WAN if SYNCLINK_XX_HDLC'
enables the above behavior.
I thought the Makefile change was to allow generic HDLC
to build as a module. I'll need to look at that closer.
