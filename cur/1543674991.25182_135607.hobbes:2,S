Maybe.
The below patch has been in -mm for some time.  It was supposed to kill the
IRQ if 750 of the previous 1000 IRQs weren't handled.
I disabled the killing code because it was triggering on someone's
works-just-fine setup.
There will be pain involved in getting all this to work right.  Do you
really think there's much value in it?
Attempt to do something intelligent with IRQ handlers which don't return
IRQ_HANDLED.
- If they return neither IRQ_HANDLED nor IRQ_NONE, complain.
- If they return IRQ_NONE more than 750 times in 1000 interrupts, complain
  and disable the IRQ.
