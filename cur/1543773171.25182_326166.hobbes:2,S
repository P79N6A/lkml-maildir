That makes the best sense, yes.

No need to check the list: any filesystem using simple_dir_operations
is using dcache_readdir, which implies there's no storage to be synced.
And we all agree that success is a more helpful retval than -EINVAL
when there's nothing for fsync to do.  Here's a patch if you haven't
done it already....
tmpfs, and all other users of simple_dir_operations, should return 0
to say directory fsync was successful, instead of the worrying -EINVAL.
