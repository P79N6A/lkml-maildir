And it is also obviously bull.  DOS 1.x (which was a pure CP/M clone)
used / as the option character, so for compatibility they couldn't use
it for paths... *especially* since DOS made it legal to type the
option immediately adjacent to a pathname (COPY FOO BAR/V).  DOS 2.x
actually had an option to use - as the option character, which made it
possible to use / as a pathname separator.  DOS 2.x also had a kernel
option to only recognize devices if the path was prepended with \DEV\
(or /DEV/), instead of polluting the namespace of every single
directory.  I believe OS/2 actually used this.
To this day, every version of DOS 2.0 and later allows you to use / as
the pathname separator in system calls -- but most utilities will see
it as an option marker.)
