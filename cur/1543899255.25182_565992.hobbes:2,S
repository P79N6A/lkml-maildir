Tip of the day:
Also test the compilation of the configuration you are changing.
With CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=n:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      mm/slub.o
/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.6/linux-2.6.22-rc6-mm1/mm/slub.c: In function ‘init_kmem_cache_node’:
/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.6/linux-2.6.22-rc6-mm1/mm/slub.c:1873: error: ‘struct kmem_cache_node’ has no member named ‘full’
...
make[2]: *** [mm/slub.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
Another problem with this patch are the added inline's:
gcc already automatically inlines static functions with only one caller, 
and decides for other static functions based on the size of the function.
