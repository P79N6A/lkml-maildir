This is an updated patch for SCx200 support.  This patch is against
linux-2.4.19-pre2 and adds support for some SCx200 specific features
such as the GPIO pins, the watchdog and flash mapping via the DOCCS
pin.  Compared to the earlier patch, I've cleaned up a few more
things, and have also added a driver for the ACCESS.bus found in the
SCx200 CPUs.
BTW, what format do you preferr the patches in?  Should I place them
inline in the body of the mail or as an attachment as here?
