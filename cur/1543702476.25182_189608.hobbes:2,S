And there are reasons for drivers still using the pci_* API. In tms380tr,
i support both PCI and ISA cards. The pci_* API supports mapping ISA cards
for bus master DMA by passing a NULL for pdev. The new API still fails
because of the BUG_ON(dev->bus != &pci_bus_type). Unfortunately, on 64 bit
platforms like Alpha, the mapping is required to set up the IOMMU.
