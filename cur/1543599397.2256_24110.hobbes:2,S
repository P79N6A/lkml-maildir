Subject: Treating parallel port as serial device

I'm looking to attach a serial device to my box that has only TTL level
I/O.  Since I'm more of a software than a hardware person making a
circuit board up with a max232 in is a bit risky...  I want to connect
the I/O to the parallel port.
What I need now is a driver that can read the input from a  pin on the
parallel port and treat it as serial input.  It sounds like the kind of
project that would have been done before, but I can't find anything that
even comes close.  Userspace probably wouldn't cut it as I'm reading as
9600 baud and usleep doesn't have nearly enough resolution.
