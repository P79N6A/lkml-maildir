Subject: RFC: bus_type and device_class merge (or partial merge)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	If there is a more specific mailing list than lkml for discussing
the generic driver model, please feel free to redirect me.
	I'm thinking about trying to embed struct device_class into
struct bus_type or perhaps just eliminate the separate struct
bus_type.  The two structures are almost identical, especially
considering that device_class.devnum appears not to be used by
anything.
struct bus_type {
	char			* name;
	struct subsystem	subsys;
	struct subsystem	drvsubsys;
	struct subsystem	devsubsys;
	struct list_head	devices;
	struct list_head	drivers;
	int		(*match)(struct device * dev, struct device_driver * drv);
	struct device * (*add)	(struct device * parent, char * bus_id);
	int		(*hotplug) (struct device *dev, char **envp, 
				    int num_envp, char *buffer, int buffer_size);
};
struct device_class {
	char			* name;
	u32			devnum;
	struct subsystem	subsys;
	struct subsystem	devsubsys;
	struct subsystem	drvsubsys;
	struct list_head	drivers;
	struct list_head	devices;
	int	(*add_device)(struct device *);
	void	(*remove_device)(struct device *);
	int	(*hotplug)(struct device *dev, char **envp, 
			   int num_envp, char *buffer, int buffer_size);
};
	At first appearance, a bus_type (PCI, USB, etc.) and a
device_class (network devices, input, block devices), may seem like
opposite ends of the device driver abstraction, but really I think
these are basically the same, and, more importantly, there can be many
layers of these interfaces, and the decision about which are bus_types
and which are device_classes is causing unnecessary coplexity.  For
example, SCSI defines both.  SCSI can be a hardware bus, bus it also
needs device_class so that scsi_debug (and eventually scsi generic) can
use the struct interface mechanism.
	If you look at the five places where a struct device_class is
actually defined in 2.5.52, you'll see that either the device_class is
not referenced by anything else or it has no bus type.  So, there
seems to be little use of the distinction.
device_class variable   Referenced elsewhere?           bus_type?
cpu_devclass            No                              system_bus_type
memblk_devclass         No                              system_bus_type
node_devclass           No                              system_bus_type
input_devclass          Yes (mousedev, tsdev)           (None)
shost_devclass          Yes (scsi_debug)                (None)
	Also, merging device_class and bus_type could also enable a
little more consolidation between struct device_interface and struct
device_driver (as with device_class.devnum, device_interface.devnum
does not appear to be used currently).
	Anyhow, I think this could shrink the drivers/base a bit and
make it slightly more understandable.  I'd be interested in knowing if
anyone else is contemplating or developing this or wants to point out
issues to watch out for.
