That is not the case. The "magic" ends in arch specific 
*_alloc_dma_coherent function tinkering around with __GFP_DMA and in 
x86_64 in addition GFP_DMA32.

Right.

And then about DMA zones being associated with arch independent memory 
ranges which is not the case. GFP_DMA32 just happens to be defined by a
single arch and thus is has only one interpretation.

I agree.
