Right then. I've just 'borrowed' the same motherboard (Asus PC-DL Deluxe) and 
CPUs from the local friendly computer place. I simply connected the hard 
drive to their combo and booted. SAME RESULT.
To confirm these (SEVERE) issues, I installed (deep breath, apologies, etc,) 
Windows XP Pro. Regrettably, the Micro$oft beast worked perfectly. Four 
processors in task manager, no hangs after several hours of 'doing stuff'.
I don't know what's going on with Linux and this motherboard. Is it the 
strangeness of Asus putting a Canterwood and Intel ICH5 chipset together to 
get the 533 FSB out of the Xeon?
The symptoms only show up if I'm doing 'dev'. In other words, I can boot into 
KDE, play music, watch DVDs and even play Enemy Territory - all with HT 
enabled. However AS SOON as I begin the configure/make/install cycle the 
system will hang. It's almost like an interrupt is gumming up the works 
somehow, but I lack the expertise to pinpoint it. For the record, I'm running 
a Radeon9800Pro graphics card.
I dunno why there haven't been more issues like this. Then again, most of the 
folk I hear on the Asus forums are using these mobos with Windoze.
What can I do to help you chaps get to the bottom of this? (Interestingly I 
note that turning off ACPI - not APIC - with HT enabled causes the kernel to 
not realise that HT is in fact enabled. I though the kernel used CPUIDs to 
work out whether HT was enabled?)
