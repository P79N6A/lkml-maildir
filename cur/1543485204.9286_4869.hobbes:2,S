I had problems with using a Future Domain TMC-950 (pathetic 8 bit card) scsi adapter, using seagate.c until I modified it -- it was giving HUGE interrupt latency.  That is, I'd loose characters at 2400 bps, with a 16550 uart.  My problem is, that I don't know if I fixed it properly.  But I have been using the changes without problems for quite a while. (I can't actually remember what I chanaged, though)  The seagate driver was broken, before 2.1.110 or so... so I was using 2.0.35 (i think?) until it was fixed... 2.0.x and 2.2.x are behaving the same, now.
Now, I'm wondering, is it just the slow cards that have problems?
