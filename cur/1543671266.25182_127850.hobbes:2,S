I didn't qualify this for two reasons:
 - also an ALSA mixer may choose not to show a "mute" button (or
   equivalent) to the user
 - how am I to tell if my mixer is an ALSA or an OSS mixer ?
That's why I think a "if there's a mute button, set it to unmute,
if there's none, don't worry" rule is easier to understand.
I'd also expect that "mute" will sometimes be confused with input
selection (at least that happened to me, because I'm used to
XMixer and didn't realize there was another set of controls, e.g.
in KMix), but the rule will still work.
