which ones, could you elaborate? I don't see anything controversial in
the above points.

I'm not at all against code complexity when it is worthwhile, but given
the potential ram and cpu overhead of the complex code and considering
this stuff should be ready in a few months I would prefer to keep things
simple.  Especially because if you really want, as said you could make
things complex (and slower ;) behind this new API w/o userspace
noticing.  Then you can drop the sysctl (or make it insignificant).

yes.
