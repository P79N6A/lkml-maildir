The problem is caused by the too high sequence numbers in stock
kernel, as I said. Plus, the sequence decrementing doesn't take
request/buffer size into account. So the starvation _is_ limited,
the limit is just too high.

If performance is down, then that problem is most likely elsewhere.
I/O limited benchmarking typically thrives on lots of request
latency -- with that comes better throughput for individual threads.
