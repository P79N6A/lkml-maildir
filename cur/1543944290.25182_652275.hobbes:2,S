The problem is how do we use a?  Usually we need to track your -rc tree
as our fixes go in ... some of which affect our development trees.
If we stick with (a) as the base, we don't get to pull in the fixes in
your tree.  If we use your tree we have to pull in (a) creating n
different merge points for the n different upstream trees..

Yes, this is effectively what I did with the post merge SCSI tree.
However, if you do this rebasing becomes a fact of life because you need
to rebase out all the dependencies you have before you merge (in fact,
it's a good way of checking whether your dependencies have been merged
yet or not, seeing what survives a rebase).
