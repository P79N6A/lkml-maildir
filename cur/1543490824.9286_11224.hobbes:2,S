Hello,
Enabling the "BSD Process Accounting" option will cause the 2.2.4
compilation (make zImage) to die with the following error messages:
acct.c: In function `sys_acct':
acct.c:197: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
acct.c:203: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
make[2]: *** [acct.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/root/linux/kernel'
make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/root/linux/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_kernel] Error 2
This seems to happen because of the code in the kernel/acct.c file.
Hope this is helpful,
Florin
