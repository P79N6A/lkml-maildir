	... it's a 2048 bytes/sector device, and Linux doesn't like that at all.
	Early in the
	initialisation of the driver, it tries to send a 1 KByte request to the
	device, and there's
	a check in the driver that essentially checks that the request size is a
	multiple of
	the block size.  And it's not - it's a fraction of it.
	What can I do?
Maybe tell us what kernel version you are talking about?
I think 2048 bytes/sector devices work reasonably well with recent
kernels.
Once things go well at boot time, and you come to partitioning,
don't forget the -b 2048 flag to fdisk.
