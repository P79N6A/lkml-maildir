Did it. Gentlemen, how long will it take you to notice something strange
in the following?
static inline int all_zeroes(u32 *p, u32 *q)
{
        while (p < q)
                if (*p++)
                        return 1;
        return 0;
}
Damn... OK, I'm building it with the obvious fix. Linus, could you pass me
one of those brown paperbags?

PS: folks, _any_ additional eyes are more than welcome. I tried to make
the structure of code as straightforward as possible, so it should be
readable...
