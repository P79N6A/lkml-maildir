The original intention essentially ignored efficiency. I've no
objection to dropping whatever pieces don't fit (or, for that matter,
whatever sort of NIH). The hope in posting all this was that some piece
might be found useful as an example or guide to doing the real patches
for mainline. If any of it is useful as it stands, that's good too.
