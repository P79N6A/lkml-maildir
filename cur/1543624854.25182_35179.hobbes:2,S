Chances are the binary win4lin module just needs to be recompiled
against a preemptive kernel.
Of course, it could need some specific preempt-safe work but more than
likely it just needs to be recompiled.  Binary modules most be
specifically preempt-kernel aware, like they need be SMP-kernel aware.
