One thing that will cause this is changing HZ to 1024, as seems to be a
popular thing to do lately. It causes an overflow in the general scsi 
timeout variable. The following one line patch fixes this - as will
changing HZ back to 1024. Again, this is only for the case where you have
changed HZ to 1024! If you haven't touched HZ, then there is another
problem.
