See <Documentation/fb/modedb.txt> for a little help: <quote>
Valid mode specifiers (mode_option argument):
    <xres>x<yres>[-<bpp>][@<refresh>]
    <name>[-<bpp>][@<refresh>]
with <xres>, <yres>, <bpp> and <refresh> decimal numbers and <name> a string.
Things between square brackets are optional.

I haven't done this, but I've seen emails using syntax like so:
(from /etc/lilo.conf:)
append="video=radeonfb:1024x768-32@100"
or:
append="video=radeonfb radeonfb.mode_option=1280x1024-32@60"
or:
append="video=radeonfb:1024x768-32@100"
Looking at the driver source code, I'd guess that the middle
one above is closest to correct.
ISTM that Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt needs a paragraph
about syntax for specifying parameters for built-in modules vs.
loadable modules....
