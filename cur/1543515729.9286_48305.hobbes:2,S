An internal compiler error is _always_ a bug in the compiler. You do not
really need to know this, but if that happens again you now know whom to
blame ;)

If only the kernel would be written in GNU-C ;-> In any case, pgcc-1.1.2
is waay old, and, naturally, many bugs have been fixed in pgcc-2.95.2
(gove it a try ;).
I also do not really recommend compiling the kernel with pgcc. It makes
your kernel bigger but not necessarily faster. The kernel is such a good
case of software engineering that compiler code quality does not have a
large effect on speed.
I'd guess upgrading compiler/binutils and removing the then bogus
alignment switches would be more useful.
