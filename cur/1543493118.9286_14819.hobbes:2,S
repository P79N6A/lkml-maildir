Actually it seems like more than 90% of the time in this test is spent in
munmap, particularly in filemap_sync. From quick looking at the sources, the
only routine which changed there substantially is filemap_write_page, so it
might well be because it waits for every dirtied page until it is stored to
disk and in 2.1.103 did not do that. I'm too tired now to investigate
further and actually think about it whether doing so is needed.
Cheers,
