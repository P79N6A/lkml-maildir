I tend to believe is (1). I was using 2.4.20-jam0 (-aa derived) all this
morning. It seemed to behave better than 2.4.20-rc4-ac1 on this point. I
compiled a couple apps without problems, had different apps and servers
running while both si & so and bi & bo were low. However, when I was
uncompressing mozilla-1.2.tar.gz the system locked up, just as
2.4.20-rc2aa1 did days before. ALT-SYSRQ allowed me to reboot, but I did
not take note of any kernel dump...
I am now running 2.5.47-ac6 and things are _way_ better in any aspect.
I'll post some vmstat output later when the system has been running for
a while. So far it has already uncompressed mozilla's source with no
slowdown or lockup.
