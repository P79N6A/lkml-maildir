So do I understand that hashing tmpfs inodes is perhaps the way to go?
Would the following also work? 
 - have a 32 bit counter: set inode->i_ino to count++
 - up the generation number each time the counter warps. 
Between boot cycles NFS could still get confused, that might be helped
by setting the initial generation to the system time. 
Thoughts anyone?
