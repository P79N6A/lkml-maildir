Hi,
For a small computer, I want to use PCMCIA compiled into the kernel. I 
only have 1 network card (fixed) in a PCMCIA slot. The kernel should 
boot (from disk) with a NFS root. Because I want to keep things as small 
as possible, I want to go without an initrd with cardutils.
So I'm wondering how to configure the network card from kernel space, if 
possible at all.
Regards,
Bas.
