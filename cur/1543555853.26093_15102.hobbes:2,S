also test11-ac4 contains the following patch which is broken and should
be reversed! (if xor.o is built as a module it will export the symbol
calibrate_xor_block_R??????? and require calibrate_xor_block ?!?)
anyway the only piece of code that uses calibrate_xor_block is
drivers/md/xor.c itself, so why export?

L.
