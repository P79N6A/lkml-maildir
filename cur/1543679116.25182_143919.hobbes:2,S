Stop right there.  Yes they do.  Mount those images and you'll find boot
disks identical to the RedHat-provided ones, except that the vmlinuz
kernel image is different.  The difference is produced by applying the
'serverworks.patch' file that is ALSO included right along with the disk
images.
Source and binaries, all wrapped up in one nice package.  Please do your
research before accusing vendors of not following GPL.  It shines a bad
light on our community.
