Yes. However, sometimes it is the only choice. 
So it does need to be fixed, and if it ends up being a noticeable
perofmance problem, then we can look at the hot-paths one by one and see
if we can avoid using it. We probably can, most of the time.

Hmm.. Grepping for "pfn_valid()", I'm starting to suspect that yes, with a
VM_IO approach and a fixed virt_addr_valid(), there really aren't any
other uses.
(virt_addr_valid() is useful for debugging and for validation of untrusted
pointers, but pfn_valid() just isn't very good for it. Never really was:  
it started out as an ugly hack, and it never got cleaned up. It should be
easily fixable with something _proper_).
