I'd love to, but unfortunately nobody seems to have come up with a way 
of doing this in Thunderbird that keeps it from mangling whitespace 
without a ton of hassle. I was able to get it to cooperate once (sort 
of, anyway, I think it may have still damaged something on the first 
try), but it required mangling a bunch of settings that made using it 
for normal mail impossible.
The last time I looked, the main "how-to" page I found had an addendum 
that "I gave up on this, it's too hard, I just attach the patches". If 
anyone has gotten any new insight..
