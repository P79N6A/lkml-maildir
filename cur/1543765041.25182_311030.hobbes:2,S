Hi,
 From 2.6.11 to 2.6.12-rc2, there are some changes in the joystick behaviour
that I don't think are expected. It's a simple joystick using analog.ko 
plugged
on a sound board using snd-ens1371. So here we go:
With 2.6.11:
$ jstest /dev/input/js0
Joystick (Analog 3-axis 4-button joystick) has 3 axes and 4 buttons. 
Driver version is 2.1.0.
Testing ... (interrupt to exit)
Axes:  0: 32767  1:-32767  2:-32767 Buttons:  0:off  1:off  2:off  3:off
Works ok, button0 is the one that serves as a gun trigger. All buttons
work as expected when I use them.
$ jstest --event /dev/input/js0
Joystick (Analog 3-axis 4-button joystick) has 3 axes and 4 buttons. 
Driver version is 2.1.0.
Testing ... (interrupt to exit)
# ...
Event: type 1, time 201830, number 0, value 0
Event: type 1, time 202082, number 0, value 1
Event: type 1, time 202229, number 0, value 0
Event: type 1, time 202355, number 0, value 1
# ...
I repeatedly press the button0, works OK.
Now with 2.6.12-rc2:
$ jstest /dev/input/js0
Joystick (Analog 3-axis 4-button joystick) has 3 axes and 5 buttons. 
Driver version is 2.1.0.
Testing ... (interrupt to exit)
Axes:  0:     0  1:     0  2:-31874 Buttons:  0:off  1:off  2:off  
3:off  4:off
Huh, now it says it has 5 buttons. The button0 is disabled, and hitting
the gun trigger (button0 in 2.6.11) changes the button4. Others buttons
work as expected.
$ jstest --event /dev/input/js0
Joystick (Analog 3-axis 4-button joystick) has 3 axes and 5 buttons. 
Driver version is 2.1.0.
Testing ... (interrupt to exit)
# ...

Still playing with the gun trigger, the negative time must be the jiffies
initialisation to -300*HZ, but the number 4 seems wrong.
Thanks.
