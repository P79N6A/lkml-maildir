Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.4-rc1 make i8042 work on a genuine i386 ibm ps/2 model 70.

Summary:
From reading 2.4.x pc_keyb.c it appears old ibm powerpc laptops
do not support the XLAT bit, refuse to set it, and continue
to pass normal scancodes.
My ibm ps/2 model 70 also refuses to set the XLAT bit, refuses to set it,
and continues to pass ``normal'' scancodes, and works just fine under
2.4.21.
Old 2.4.x behavior was to either (a) not initialize the keyboard
controller at all, or (b) when it was initialized to always attempted
to set the XLATE bit, ignoring failure.
So it looks like the correct solution if the XLAT bit is not set, at
boot is to attempt to set the XLATE bit, and if it will not set assume
the keyboard controller will not go into plain serio mode.
Here is a patch that implements that.  For everything that implements
the XLATE bit the behavior should be exactly as the previous version.
Eric
