Here it is.  I haven't tested the sigwait()+suspend lately, since
suspend isn't working with any kernel except 2.6.11.4 and I'm chasing
down other acpi errors in 2.6.13-*.  But here's a test case for how
sigwait() breaks when straced (see C file below).  It is with 2.6.13-rc4
on a Thinkpad 600X (Pentium III), Debian 'testing', libc
2.3.2.
  $ gcc waiting.c -o waiting -lpthread
  $ ./waiting
  Sigwaiting...[strace my pid, which is 3359]
  [in another shell I run 'strace -p 3359', and get:]
  sigwait() returned 4, errno=0, sig=77
In the strace window, I get 
  $ strace -p 3359
  Process 3359 attached - interrupt to quit
  write(2, "sigwait() returned 4, errno=0, s"..., 39) = 39
  exit_group(4)                           = ?
  Process 3359 detached
According to the man entry for sigwait:
       The !sigwait! function never returns an error.
so the return value should not be 4 (or the docs are not right).
Here's waiting.c:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <errno.h>
sigset_t mask;
int main () {
  int ret, id;
  int sig = 77;			/* easy to see if it gets changed */
  id = getpid();
  sigemptyset(&mask);
  fprintf (stderr, "Sigwaiting...[strace my pid, which is %d]\n", id);
  ret = sigwait(&mask, &sig);
  fprintf (stderr,
	   "sigwait() returned %d, errno=%d, sig=%d\n",
	   ret, errno, sig);
  return ret;
}
