I did not test, this might be interesting.
In fact, what would be very good would be sort of a new select/poll/epoll
syscalls with an additional argument, which would point to a structure
that the syscall would fill in return with the time of day. This would
greatly reduce the number of calls to gettimeofday() in some programs,
and make use of the time that was used by the syscall itself.
For example, if I could call it like this, it would be really cool :
   ret = select_absdate(&in, &out, &excp, &date_timeout, &return_date);
with <date_timeout> the date at which to timeout (instead of the number of
microseconds) and <return_date> the current date upon return.
Cheers,
Willy
