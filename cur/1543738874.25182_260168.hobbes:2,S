I can't say I've ever felt strongly about it. Wish I knew what was the best 
way. If we change the range of RT priority range by increasing it from 100 
to say 1000 then any arbitrary value to subtract will be wrong. How about 
just leaving the absolute dynamic priority value? Then we don't have any 
negative values confusing it, it isn't affected by increasing the range of 
RT priorities, and better priority values still are lower in value.
Cheers,
Con
