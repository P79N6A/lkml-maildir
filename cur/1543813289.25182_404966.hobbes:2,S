Except that is not going to happen because there are laws of physics 
that must be obeyed.  The phone line is encoded with 64 Kbps inside the 
digital phone network so there is no possible way to modulate more data 
than that.  There is also the problem that the A/D converter ( which is 
all the "software modem" is -- it's basically a stripped down sound card 
) only runs fast enough to support 56,000 bps.  Even if it could run 
faster, that would place even _more_ load on the cpu.

They ARE necessarily worse than real modems in that they require a fair 
amount of cpu cycles to perform all the DSP.  IIRC, this also has to be 
done in interrupt context to maintain the low latency required, which 
lowers the interactive responsiveness of the system - even when you are 
not transferring much data.
