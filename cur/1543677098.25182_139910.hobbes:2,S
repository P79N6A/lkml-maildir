Ha Matti, I was going to suggest you to send a patch to the man page
maintainer, but maybe the wording you ask for is there already and
you just have some outdated version of the manpages?

       O_DIRECT
              Try to minimize cache effects of  the  I/O  to  and
              from  this file.  In general this will degrade per-
              formance, but it is useful in  special  situations,
              such  as  when  applications  do their own caching.
              File  I/O  is  done  directly  to/from  user  space
              buffers.  The I/O is synchronous, i.e., at the com-
              pletion of the read(2)  or  write(2)  system  call,
              data   is  guaranteed  to  have  been  transferred.
              Transfer sizes, and the alignment  of  user  buffer
              and  file offset must all be multiples of the logi-
              cal block size of the file system.
