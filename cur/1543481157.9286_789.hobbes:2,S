AFAIK, the 2.1.127p3 version still works perfectly, you can find it at:
http://www-sop.inria.fr/prisme/personnel/pion/progs/linux/
Renaming it "2.2" and putting it on sunsite would be a good idea...
For 2.3.x, when stats per devices will be available, I might come up with a
smaller patch (namely, the idle time counting will be doable in user space,
hopefully).  Then the only remaining thing in the kernel would be the spin up
code.  Hopefully, that one would be includable ;-)
