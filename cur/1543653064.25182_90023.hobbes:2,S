One thing we've done before in other bug-tracking systems was to create
a "STALE" state (or something similar) for this type of bug. So it 
wouldn't get closed (I have seen this done as a closing resolution, but
I think that's a bad idea), but it wouldn't be in the default searches
either ... you could just select it if you wanted it ... does that sound
sane? (obviously we don't need this yet, but might be a good plan
longer-term).
