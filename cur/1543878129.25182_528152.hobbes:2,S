	while($arg =~ s/\[(.*)\s+(.*)\]/[$1$2]/) {
	}
should do it, and saves us the pre-matching. (Also note the + at \s)
(No need to escape [ and ] in the target pattern.)
I can also offer this gem which should do it the most saving way by
matching the inside of [] exactly once, and otherwise
matching/replacing only on \s:
	$arg =~ s{\[(.*)\]}{($_=$1)=~s/\s+//g;"[$_]"}e;
(I already hear everyone screaming... ;-)
