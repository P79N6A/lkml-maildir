Sure, that would be ideal. But how? You can't get that from the SMAPI
BIOS - it's totally opaque. You just write a constant to port 0xB2,
which triggers an SMI; the BIOS merrily does its thing in SMM and
returns; you see the final results in the CPU registers.

ThinkPad T43 BIOS 1.24, Hitahi HTS726060M9AT00 firmware MH4OA6GA. No
idea how to proceed beyond this.
The thing is, there *is* a working interface, which is also used by
the Windows drivers...

Why? BTW, isn't this similar to the queue freeze functionality needed
by the disk park part of the ThinkPad HDAPS?

We don't understand the controller interface sufficiently well to
fully abstract it (no specs, and the two conflicting drivers do things
somewhat differently), so for now the low-level driver may only handle
locking... Is there an easier way to just share a mutex?
Anyway, can you point out a minimal example (or two) of such low-level
drivers in the current kernel, so I can imitate the recommended
interface convention?
