I wanted to compile the kernel (2.0.36) on my P2 300 with 163840 kb
memory. make dep; make clean; make zImage are done without any warnings
or errors. But only until the end of make zImage. These are the last
eight lines I always receive:
	Root device is (3,3)
	Boot sector 512 bytes.
	Setup is 4416 bytes.
	System is 526 kb
	System is too big
	make [1]: *** [zImage] Error 1
	make [1]: Leaving dirctory /usr/src/linux/.../boot
	make [1]: *** [zImage] Error 2
I don´t know what to do. I´d pleased if anybody can help me. Thanx!!!
