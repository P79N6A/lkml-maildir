Subject: [RFC][PATCH 0/3] CGroups: CGroups: Hierarchy locking/refcount changes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/10/378

These patches present an alternative to some of the other cgroups
locking/refcount patches that have been proposed on LKML recently.
Several of these patches have been to address the race opened by
moving the calls to pre_destroy() callbacks outside of cgroup_mutex;
rather than continuing to patch up the holes caused by that change,
these patches introduce new locking/refcount rules to ultimately allow
the previous atomicity of cgroup_rmdir() to be restored.
These three patches give:
1/3 - introduce a per-subsystem hierarchy_mutex which a subsystem can
      use to prevent changes to its own cgroup tree
2/3 - use hierarchy_mutex in place of calling cgroup_lock() in the
      memory controller
3/3 - introduce a css_tryget() function similar to the one proposed by
      Kamezawa, but avoiding spurious refcount failures in the event
      of a race between a css_tryget() and an unsuccessful cgroup_rmdir()
Future patches will likely involve:
- using hierarchy mutex in place of cgroup_lock() in more subsystems
  where appropriate
- restoring the atomicity of cgroup_rmdir() with respect to cgroup_create()
