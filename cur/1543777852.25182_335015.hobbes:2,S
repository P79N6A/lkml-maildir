Hey Randy,
The mktemp command fails for me, but patchview keeps on going.
[njw@njw ~/tmp]$ patchview mypatch.patch linux-2.6.13-rc3
mktemp: cannot make temp dir /home/njw/tmp/XXXXXX/tmp.xV1xRT: No such file or directory
failed mktemp for patch files dir.
mkdir: cannot create directory `/fs': Permission denied
cp: cannot create regular file `/fs/Kconfig': No such file or directory
mkdir: cannot create directory `/fs': Permission denied
cp: cannot create regular file `/fs/Makefile': No such file or directory
[ ... ]
This patch makes mktemp work correctly for me and causes patchview to exit
if it happens to fail.
Thanks,
Nick Wilson
