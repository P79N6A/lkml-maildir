On my SuSE 10 system, I find the following lines in /etc/syslog.conf:
# print most on tty10 and on the xconsole pipe
#
kern.warning;*.err;authpriv.none         /dev/tty10
kern.warning;*.err;authpriv.none        |/dev/xconsole
Changing tty10 to ttyS0 and restarting rcsyslog has no influence on the
output of SysReq commands, but obviously they now nolonger appear on
tty10. So what's the correct way to delegate the output to serial console?
PS: kernel command line: ... console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty0
BTW: a short update of my freeze issue:
- memtest86 revealed a bad memory location
- accidentially beeing at tty10 when the freeze happend and sysrq-p
showed that the atheros module got stuck
- exchanging RAM and disabling ath0 seems to cure the system for 39
minutes so far ;-)
Bye.
