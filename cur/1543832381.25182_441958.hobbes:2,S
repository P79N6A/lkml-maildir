Sorry, this turned out to be my fault.
GCC had just recently been upgraded to 4.1.1, which apparently silently 
generates bad kernels with the version of H. J. Lu's binutils I had 
installed. I figured it out when going back to 2.6.17 didn't help. Why the 
crashes were sporadic I will never truly understand.
Going back to GNU binutils 2.17 and rebuilding GCC 4.1.1 fixed it. At least I 
learnt how to use Git, which is a truly superb tool. I'm now happily 
running -mm6.
