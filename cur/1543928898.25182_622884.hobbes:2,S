I've been giving the fix some QA - that change appears to have caused
a different regression as well so I'm holding off for a little bit
until we know what the cause of the other regression is before deciding
whether to take this fix or back the entire change out.
Either way we'll include the fix in 2.6.24....
Cheers,
Dave.
