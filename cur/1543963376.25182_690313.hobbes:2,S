There are some functions to set CPU affinity from user space:
sched_setaffinity()
sched_getaffinity()
And a user space program:
taskset
All have decent man pages.  They'll allow you to pin a process to a 
particular CPU, or set the normal behavior, which is to try and keep a 
process on the same CPU as long as possible.  There are some other 
utilities mentioned in the related section of the manpages - they allow 
you to tweak scheduler behavior.
Hope that helps.
Cheers,
Dan
