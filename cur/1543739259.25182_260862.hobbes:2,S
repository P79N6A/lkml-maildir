I'm trying to learn how to work with bitwise on obsolete stuff, but
checking there is good, too, right?
Is this right way to do it?
+typedef enum pm_request __bitwise {
+       __bitwise PM_SUSPEND, /* enter D1-D3 */
+       __bitwise PM_RESUME,  /* enter D0 */
+} pm_request_t;
+
+/*
+ * Device types... these are passed to pm_register
+ */
+typedef enum pm_dev_type __bitwise {
+       __bitwise PM_UNKNOWN_DEV = 0, /* generic */
+       __bitwise PM_SYS_DEV,       /* system device (fan, KB
controller, ...) */
+       __bitwise PM_PCI_DEV,       /* PCI device */
+       __bitwise PM_USB_DEV,       /* USB device */
+       __bitwise PM_SCSI_DEV,      /* SCSI device */
+       __bitwise PM_ISA_DEV,       /* ISA device */
+       __bitwise PM_MTD_DEV,       /* Memory Technology Device */
+} pm_dev_t;
Having __bitwise at every line in enum looks quite ugly to my
eyes. [Where to get sparse? I tried to google for it but "sparse" is
very common word (as in sparse matrix). And theres no
kernel/people/linus on kernel.org...]
