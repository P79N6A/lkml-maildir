That's actually the goal, but I agree we would need a flag to pass
when loading AES module to say "I want an exclusive usage of it and
therefore it can be run faster".
If you have several users of AES module, you can choose (a) use the
no-optimized version for all users or (b) choose which user needs to
be run quickly and make it exclusively use the AES hw module; the
others users would use the generic AES (the slower one).
