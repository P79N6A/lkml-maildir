Me too!  :-)

Nope. There is a generic pointer you can use. You just need to
figure out when to free it, assuming you don't want to leak
lots of memory. Student projects can leak -- lucky you!

Gotta love d_delete the function and d_delete the function pointer
in a struct. Discovery was cause for inventing new curses.
Along the way I stumble accross a "retval" that is only set once
and a "if(de &&" of "if(!de ||" (I forget) that is redundant.
Maybe in the proc or tmpfs code, just in case someone cares enough.
