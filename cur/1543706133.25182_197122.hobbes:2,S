Seems you make several device nodes for the _same_ device, with different
owners.  This is not the normal way to do i, are you going to
create a new set of nodes whenever there's a new user?
The usual way is to have only one node per device, and set permissions
so that all users can use the device.  Let the cdrom device be owned
by some group (cdromusers). Lett all your users belong to that group,
and give the group rw permissions.  Similar for other shared devices.

Seems you have a lousy soundcard (or sound driver) that isn't shareable.
Several solutions:
1. Replace with a shareable card.  I know the trident 4dwave cards are,
   there are probably others.  This is also useful when a single
   user want to run two sound programs simultaneously, such as
   both "system sounds" and a game and a background mp3/cd at the same time.
2. Use several cards, the best solution if your simultaneous users sit at 
   different locations.  Each may then have his/her own set of speakers.
3. Use software mixing, there are sound daemons available for this purpose.

Take a look at how groups & permissions works.  Then think about
what kind of soundcard you want.
