We're happy to say we won't sell or publish the material in any way 
*other* than the openlogging web pages.  I'm not sure what good that
does, the cat is out of the bag on the web pages so I can't imagine 
a market for the data which is freely available, but if you are worried, 
propose some language, we'll shove it in the above web page if the
language is reasonable (i.e., doesn't preclude openlogging itself).
