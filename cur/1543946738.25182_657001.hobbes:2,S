There is a big difference between accuracy and granularity. Even a coarse 
grained scale can be accurate (just within its resolution) and a fine 
grained scale can be very inaccurate if you shift around the scale.
Please keep this separate, otherwise this can go on forever...

Out of curiosity, what kind of hardware error do you expect?
If you have that crappy hardware you're better off initializing the clock 
with the correct frequency.

You need some kind of fix point and everyone is using 1sec for as base 
length, for some mysterious reason you're now trying to redefine it.
The PIT (and any clock based on it) has a certain resolution, so with an 
update frequency of HZ=1000 it produces a certain error, but why on earth 
are you trying to introduce this error as universal constant? This is a 
property of the PIT clock, applying this error to every other clock makes 
no sense.

Actually it's not that simple, ntp_update_frequency() only calculates the 
base length, time_offset had to be scaled as well (and back when requested 
from user space). You would add a lot of complexity for a silly little 
error, which the current mechanisms can handle just fine.

Again, what kind of crappy hardware do you expect? Aren't clocks supposed 
to get better and not worse?
Where do you get this idea that the 500ppm are exclusively for hardware 
errors? If you have such bad hardware, there is another simple solution: 
change HZ to 100 and the error is reduced to 15ppm.
I would see the point if this problem had actually any practically 
relevance, but this error is not a problem for pretty much all existing 
standard hardware. Why are you insisting on redesigning timekeeping for 
broken hardware?

There's nothing 'injected', that resolution error is very real and the 
500ppm limit is more than enough to deal with this. _Nobody_ is hurt by 
this.

The point is you are redefining a mechanism which has _never_ been 
intendend for purpose you're trying to abuse it for now.
Reread the original patch, it was intended for kernel with HZ of 2000, 
where the error would be 687ppm. Now we have other ways to increase the 
resolution, timekeeping isn't solely based on the PIT anymore. The whole 
reason for the original patch is pretty much gone by now.
If you really need some kind of adjustment for your extremely broken 
hardware, below is the absolute maximum you need, which doesn't inflict 
more insanity on all the sane hardware.

Revert bbe4d18ac2e058c56adb0cd71f49d9ed3216a405 and 
e13a2e61dd5152f5499d2003470acf9c838eab84 and remove CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST 
completely. Add a optional kernel parameter ntp_tick_adj instead to allow 
adjusting of a large base drift and thus keeping ntpd happy.
The CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST mechanism was introduced at a time PIT was the 
primary clock, but we have a varity of clock sources now, so a global PIT 
specific adjustment makes little sense anymore.
