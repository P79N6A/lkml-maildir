I'd prefer it if you (and everyone else) could give a meaningful
English-language Subject: to patches, please.
A well-chosen patch Subject: becomes a sort of globally-unique key by which
the patch is tracked - I munge it into a patch filename and it propagates
all the way into bitkeeper.  It can be used for searching email folders,
googling, inter-developer discussion, etc, etc.
Thanks.
