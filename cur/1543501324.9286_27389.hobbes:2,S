Hello to all
I used Linux with kernel 2.0.x (x < 28) as a dial-on-demand-router with
IP-Masquerading on dynamic assigned IP-Addresses. When the connection
was closed due to idle-timeout, the first IP-packet fires up the
connection but doesn't go thru. For example, when I read a webpage and
the connection goes down, and I then klick a link the connection goes up
but I have to stop the transfer in the web-browser and klick the link
again to get a reply.
Has this 'problem/feature' changed in newer kernels?
Bye
f.d.g.
