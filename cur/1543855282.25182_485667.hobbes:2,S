No, I think this was a total failure. We should have reverted it 
immediately rather than waiting for the fix. Especially as the damn thing 
wasn't even all that important.
I now (finally) have the patch from Andrew, but we should _not_ have had 
this thing broken for three days. It should have gotten reverted on the 
first report of trouble, instead of us telling people to just wait.
Broken compiles are simply not acceptable. Patches that cause them should 
be reverted _immediately_ unless a fix is available as quickly (which it 
wasn't due to turkey-day).
No excuses. People _should_ be impatient about idiotic failures like this.
