The hash table is likely to big anyways; eating cache and not helping that
much. If you're interested in some testing
I can send you patches to change it by hand and collect statistics for
average hash queue length. Then you can figure out a good size for your
workload with some work. Longer time I think the table sizing heuristics
are far too aggressive and need to be throttled back; but that needs more
data from real servers.
