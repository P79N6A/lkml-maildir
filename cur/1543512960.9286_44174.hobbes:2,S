I've used both and yes they are both still buggy and should remain  marked
as such.  Is anybody still actively maintaining them?
HFS at least seems like a good thing to have around when it actually works.
I havent looked at the code for HFS for quite some time so I dont know the
status of its progress.
I've sinned this week and now must use  a windoze boxs. I cant easily get to
the code right now.
