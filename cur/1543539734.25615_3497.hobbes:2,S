Subject: Reading turbo switch/key lock from kernel space?

I am working on some biometric authentication stuff in userland, and
as part of the procedure it would be nice to read the status of the
turbo switch or key lock from the kernel, and make it available as a
read-only sysctl.  Is this possible?
If so, is the status of those switches modifiable from kernel or user
space by default?
Thanks,
