That's pio4 (16.6666MBytes/sec).
pio6 should have the same cycle time as udma4.

But internally libata is probably breaking those up into 64KB transfers,
with gaps between requests.  The best it could do would be 128KB transfers.
To maximize throughput, some kind of host-queuing would be needed,
or just have the driver sit in a tight loop, starting the next I/O
immediately when the previous one finishes.  Linux isn't that quick (yet).
