Sure.  It's not really hard to do that in 2.3. 
The 2.3 VM doesn't force you to use generic_file_write().
grab_cache_page() and read_cache_page() can be used by other filesystems
to access the page cache, and you can use that in your own file_write
function to do any sort of transformations you want during the write()
system call.  You don't want to use generic_file_write(), as that
assumes that the disk blocks we're using for IO correspond exactly to
the contents of the page cache.  That doesn't prevent you from using
your own file_write function to update the page cache and then do any
other write-through you want to the buffer cache.
