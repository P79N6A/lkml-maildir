Unfortunately that was an older version of reiser4, and we are still 
analyzing why it has higher read performance than what we are shipping 
today.  Give me a week, and I'll have a better answer for you.  What we 
shipped has higher read performance than ext3, but something is not what 
it should be and needs fixing.
Green and Zam and Umka, on Monday please start work on seriously 
analyzing how the block allocation differs between the new and the old 
kernel, now that you can finally reproduce the benchmark on the old kernel.
