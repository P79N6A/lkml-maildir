This looks like a case of the old 2.4 interrupt handling problems
which got resolved by rewriting the ARM interrupt handling
infrastructure during 2.5.
The problem occurs because of the need to handle edge-triggered
interrupts (as is the case with Intel CPUs) differently from
level-triggered interrupts, especially when the peripherals are
designed to be used with level-triggered inputs.
In effect, you can end up with the situation where the device has
its interrupt asserted, but because the CPU doesn't see a change
of state, it "forgets" about the interrupt input.
I'm not aware of a solution for this problem with 2.4 kernels.
