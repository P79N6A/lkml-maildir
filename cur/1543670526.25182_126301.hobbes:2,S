Hey, if we have 50 million machines running 2.6 for three years, this
optimization saves 100 clock cycles per boot (most kstrdups are device
init), and machines boot once a month, and average 1GHz, that's three
minutes of saved time.
I think Jeff and I should start the kstrdup sourceforge project
immediately...
Cheers,
Rusty.
