Tough not 100% but I'm about 99% sure that having this kind of problem
no PCI bus would prevent any kind of proper level triggered IRQ handling 
  on behalf of the host controller... At least it seems very very 
unlikely. (Data transfer problems are a different story of course.)
And I personally never ever expirenced *any* problems with -u1 on any 
Linux systems I ever got in to my hands (startting 386sx 16MHz...).
Not even at the time I run the really buggy CMD640 mask revision for 3
years.

Sounds fairly well and is easy to implement...just adding
if (ch->pci_dev != NULL && ch->umask)
at the corresponding plase in ata_irq_request will do the trick.
