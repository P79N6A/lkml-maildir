"We" tends to imply 'I speak for all of us'. I was pointing out that you
don't speak for everyone. The humour in making that point didn't
translate and apparently I ended up confusing you as well which wasn't
the intent.
The joys of language.
To put it more clearly "Not everyone agrees with the remove exports"
approach, at least not the "all unused" part.
