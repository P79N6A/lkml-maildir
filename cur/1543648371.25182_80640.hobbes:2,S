Elilo already knows how to find memory, as long as you either use
the "relocatable" keyword in elilo.conf, or the "-r" command-line
option to let it know that it is OK to relocate.
Using this elilo option means that the changes I provided for
vmlinux.ld.S can be very slightly simplified, it isn't necessary
to define BASE_KVADDR as "KERNEL_START + KERNEL_TR_PAGE_SIZE", you
can just use:
#define BASE_KVADDR	KERNEL_START
