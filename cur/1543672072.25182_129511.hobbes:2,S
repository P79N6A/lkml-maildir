Subject: [2.5 PCMCIA SERIAL] name mismatch in 8250_cs.c

Hi all!
I think I found kind of a mismatch in the PCMCIA serial driver. The file 
is called 8250_cs.c, but the driver name, driver info, version string, 
log messages and comments inside the file still refer to "serial_cs". 
This seems to confuse the new module-init-tools, which try to modprobe 
the module serial_cs which of course isn't found.
A manual "modprobe 8250_cs" works fine.
