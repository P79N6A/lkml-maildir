So... how long do you have to stay in interrupt for it to be a bug?
There's *no* requirement that says "it may not take second to handle
an interrupt". Actually I guess that some nasty conditions (UHCI needs
reset?) may take that long in interrupt. Oh and actually few releases
ago, console switching was done from interrupt and it *did* take 2
seconds for me.
If someone assumes interrupts are "short", he has broken code already.
