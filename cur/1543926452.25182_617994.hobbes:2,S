Ok, I rearranged the dynamic page tables code (and fixed the bug that 31
bit processes had a 3 level page table instead of 2). It is working fine
with s390 specific versions of arch_get_unmapped_area and
arch_get_unmapped_area_topdown which do the page table upgrade. 
Which means we can drop the arch_rebalance_pgtables-call.patch from -mm
again.
