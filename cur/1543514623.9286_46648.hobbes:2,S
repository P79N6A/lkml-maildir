I'm not sure if this has been fixed, but I had quite a few errors (big crash
as well) on a system at work.  Completely related to SMP and IDE.  I
currently have 1 cpu removed to rememdy the problem.
This MOBO is a tyan dual p5 board with 2 233mmx cpus (currently, as I said,
one removed).  128mb of ram (2 32 mb simms and 4 16mb simms).  The first
crash couldn't be seen since the machine was in X.  There is an error for
today (around 10:30) in the log below.  When the machine crashed, current
open connections died (I had an ssh session to it and from that an rsh
session to another machine), connections were being listened on and still
pingable, nothing else worked.
I have attached the .config for the machine.
This is in the kernel log:

	dereference at virtual address 00000004 
-- Forwarded from the machine.  OOPS was typed in by hand the 2nd time It
	crashed --
Options used: -V (default)
              -o /lib/modules/2.2.10/ (default)
              -k /proc/ksyms (default)
              -l /proc/modules (default)
              -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)
              -c 1 (default)
You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will assume
that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running right now
and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
