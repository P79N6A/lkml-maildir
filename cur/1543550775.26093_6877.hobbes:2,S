That sounds similar to the vsyscall interface Ingo's been working on.
Why not use the read-only kernel page used for fast gettimeofday()
calibration with MSR offsets?
It's slightly more overhead than inlining the code, but it is still only
a small overhead (no kernel entry, just a function call to code in a
user-readable page).  People doing advanced dynamic compilation
techniques can always trace the vsyscall code and inline equivalent code
directly into their hot paths ;-)
