   We had a problems with synchronization between CPU and memory.
   But the problem was showing up us random crashes of applications with 
SIGSEGV and (rarely) SIGILL.
   But still to prove bug is not in Linux kernel and not in software we 
have killed three weeks, just to find out that Motorola has forgotten to 
publish one errata for their CPU.
   Probably to have an option to log this kind of signals would be 
useful. Because just blindly killing applications - is not correct too.
   I will vote for 'if unhandled -> log it' ;-)
