During a system call the userspace process switches to kernel mode and
the kernel executes the code on behalf of the process. 
Is it possible to create a client/server pair both in userspace where the client
can pull off the same context switch trick and run code in the server along the
same lines ? 
Just to stave off the inevitable I don't have in mind a library, and i don't
have in mind normal ipc/rpc. What I'm looking at is the paper at 
http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/d11/d11.html
 in particular 
http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/d11/node7.html,
 where the author suggest that the
X server could be implemented using "active contexts". Where a client X app can
context switch to become the X server to execute X calls. Short circuiting the
normal transport mechanism and giving a potential speedup for X. 
Now I haven't been able to figure out how to actually implement even a simple 
mechanism to achieve this, but then i'm not all that good. But seeing as a 
kernel can achieve this, i reckon this is a good a forum as any to get some 
pointers on the practicalities of doing something like this, though isn't the
mechanism it uses only possible for the kernel alone ?
The D11 concept seemed to be a goody, until I rapidly hit the edges of my 
knowledge, anyone have any ideas. Just in the general case of achieving 
something like this. Whether its an appropiate mechanism to use, or
whether or not GGI/DRI/DGA/Berlin/Y is better to implement is outside the
scope of whats puzzling me.
