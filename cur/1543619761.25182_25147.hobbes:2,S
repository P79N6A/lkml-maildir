Yep.  The i810 RNG userspace daemon, rngd, does this.  It reads from
i810 RNG data from /dev/intel_rng, tests the data, and injects it back
into /dev/random with the specified entropy bits.  (zero bits by default,
because we default to paranoia mode of not trusting, but that can and is
usually increased)
