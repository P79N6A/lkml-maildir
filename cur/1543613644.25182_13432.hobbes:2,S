Bug in recent 2.4.*.  It *should* stop.  One line patch has been
posted to the linux-kernel list a couple of times.  Check the archive.
It's probably in the recent pre-release kernels as well.
As a work around, try the following:
count=`blockdev --getsize /dev/ram0`
bsize=`blockdev --getss /dev/ram0`
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ram0 count=${count} bs=${bsize}
