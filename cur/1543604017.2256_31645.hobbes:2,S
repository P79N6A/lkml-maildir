   It's not just mtrr stuff, and it's not just arch-specific code either. In
   some cases, there is a need for a function which actually does flush the
   cache.
Example of this on ix86?
Regardless, the purpose of the cachetlb.txt interfaces is for the
generic VM subsystem of the kernel.  Nothing more.  If AGP, mtrr,
whatever weird device stuff needs this, it belongs in a different
area.
Franks a lot,
