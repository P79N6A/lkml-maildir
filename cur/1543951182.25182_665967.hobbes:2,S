I am using centos 5.1 along with 2.6.24.3 (as I want to use kvm-amd).
All this is working. I think by default this uses the new completely 
fair scheduler.
I want to default back to the old scheduler but compile with 
virtualization.
What option is it in the make menuconfig that is for the old scheduler.
Thanks,
Jerry
