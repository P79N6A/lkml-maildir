if inserting printk() in MIGRATE_RESERVE, I can observe MIGRATE_RESERVE
page alloc easily although heavy workload don't run.
but, there aren't my point.
ok, I guess my patch description was too poor (and a bit pointless).
So, I retry it.
(1) in general principal, the system should effort to avoid oom rather than
    performance if memory shortage happend.
    MIGRATE_RESERVE directly indicate memory shortage happend.
    and pcp caching can prevent another cpu allocation.
(2) MIGRATE_RESERVE is never searched by buffered_rmqueue() because 
    allocflags_to_migratetype() never return MIGRATE_RESERVE.
    it doesn't work as cache.
    IOW, it don't help to increase performance.
(3) if the system pass MIGRATE_RESERVE to free_hot_cold_page() continously,
    pcp queueing can reduce the number of grabing zone->lock.
    However, it is rate. because MIGRATE_RESERVE is emergency memory,
    and it is often used interupt context processing.
    continuous emergency memory allocation in interrupt context isn't so sane.
Then, unqueueing MIGRATE_RESERVE page doesn't cause performance degression
and, it can (a bit) increase realibility and I think merit is much over demerit.

Yup, I believe at that time your decision is right.
However, I think the condision was changed (or to be able to change).
 (1) legacy pcp implementation deeply relate to struct zone size.
     and, to blow up struct zone size cause performance degression
     because cache miss increasing.
     However, it solved cristoph's cpu-alloc patch
 (2) legacy pcp doesn't have total number of pages restriction.
     So, increasing lists directly cause number of pages in pcp.
     it can cause oom problem on large numa environment.
     However, I think we can implement total number of pages restriction.
