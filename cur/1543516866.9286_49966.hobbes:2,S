I'm looking for a way to "shadow" an existing filesystem. Basically, so
that any request to /newfs/<dirs>/<file> would be redirected to
/var/newfs/<dirs>/<file>. This would be handled completely in the
kernel. I figure that I can use the same inode numbers in the shadow
filesystem as in the actual FS, and just redirect reads and
writes. However, lookup is giving me problems (since it just says "find
directory n in inode i"). Is there an easy way to lookup a prefixed path
in another filesystem?
Thanks,
Drew
