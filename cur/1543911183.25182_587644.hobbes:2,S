If you have a patch to do so, I would appreciate it.
But the main reason I don't push such a change into Linus's tree is that
there are still a lot of statically allocated kobjects today, like all
driver definitions :(
Converting them to be dynamic is on my list of things to do, it's just a
ways down there.
