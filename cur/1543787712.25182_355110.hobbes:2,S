That's correct.  If your child is in TASK_TRACED because someone else is
ptrace'ing it, then you don't notice its state.

Actually, it can in two cases.  First is SIGKILL, which can always wake it
up suddenly.  The second is when we are not the actual ptrace parent, but
another thread in the same thread group.  (do_wait loops on all the threads
in the group and checks each one's children list.  my_ptrace_child does not
distinguish the ptracer from other threads in its group.)

Indeed.  I failed to notice this > test when the other just came up recently,
because I had a change to it kicking around in my tree for a long time.
I can't honestly recall and would have to reconstruct why I wrote it this way.
The simple change Linus suggested seems fine too, probably better.
Thanks,
Roland
