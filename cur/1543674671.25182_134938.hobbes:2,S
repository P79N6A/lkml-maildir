I believe (DaveM will speak with authority) that hitherto it has been
assumed that I/O (well, Input) brings data actually into memory: we use
flush_dcache_page if kernel memsets or memcpys data, not if it's read in.
If this mode+architecture departs from that, then we would need another
macro, which translates to flush_dcache_page (sufficient?) for that,
and is a nop for everything else.
And where would it be placed?  I think not where the flush_page_to_ram
used to be in filemap_nopage, but after the ->readpage.  Or... would
this tie in with Martin's s390 request for a SetPageUptodate hook?
