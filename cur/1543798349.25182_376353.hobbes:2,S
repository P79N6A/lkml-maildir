The system has been idle. Increasing the load should worsen the errors,
but they're pretty frequent so i might not see.
The computer's ISA-PNP Crystal Sound CS4235 soldered onto the
motherboard sounds best with the main pci latency timer set to 0, but
this gives serial overruns, so i've made a small 'mon', or modem on,
script to reset this:
# mon
/etc/rc.d/rc.acpidyn-modem restart
/sbin/setpci -v -s 00:00.0 LATENCY_TIMER=20
and another for when the modem's not needed, 'moff'
# moff
/etc/rc.d/rc.acpidyn restart
/sbin/setpci -v -s 00:00.0 LATENCY_TIMER=0
/sbin/rmmod 8250 serial_core
and this seems to work well.  The sound worsens as you increase the
00:00.0 LATENCY_TIMER.
