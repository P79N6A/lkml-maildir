Well, for TCP connections, this looks relevant (include/net/tcp.h:26):
/* This is for all connections with a full identity, no wildcards.
 * New scheme, half the table is for TIME_WAIT, the other half is
 * for the rest.  I'll experiment with dynamic table growth later.
 */
#define TCP_HTABLE_SIZE         512
so I'd have thought you ought to get 256.
