 Any specific references?  Recently I've been able to get seemingly quite
stable builds of MIPS64/Linux running on an R4000SC rev. 3.0 (I believe
the initial commercial release was 2.2 and that only differs by two
additional errata documented that are not related to 64-bit operation
anyway) and an R4400SC rev. 1.0 (the initial one).  It wasn't entirely
straightforward to get proper workarounds implemented and the errata used
to bite badly without them, but now the kernel seems to run quite well --
I used to get uptimes of a week with only an administrative shutdown
breaking them.
 But that's the kernel only -- we still lack a 64-bit userland which may
reveal additional gotchas.  Do you know of anything I should be aware of
beside the errata as officially documented by MIPS?  What is documented is
somewhat painful but not a showstopper -- I hope nothing else exists.
