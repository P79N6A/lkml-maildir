Version 0.90 MD superblocks (still the default) uses host-endian
values so you cannot move between architectures directly.  However
isn't too hard to make it work. 
Firstly, use
   mdadm --examine --metadata=0.swap /dev/DEVICE
to check that you have the right devices.
Then
  mdadm --assemble /dev/md0 --update=byteorder /dev/DEV0 /dev/DEV1  ....
That should assemble the array and update the superblocks so that they
are in the right byteorder and will assemble easily in future.
