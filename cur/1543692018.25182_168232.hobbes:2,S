Personally I never got the point for including something that you won't
need anyway. True you can say that it doesn't hurt anyone on the
computers nowadays but is there any specific reason for not having it
mandatory (eg. Fixing it)?

What does it cost if an unneeded driver is included in your kernel? 
Perhaps a few kB?
On a standard mass-market computer with 256 MB of RAM where the user 
uses Mozilla under KDE this is quite irrelevant.
EMBEDDED is for people that really have to count every kB to put a 
kernel onto a small floppy/flash/computer with limited RAM.
