Hi Anton,
Recently I am correcting warnings when compiling with GCC 3.2
kernel 2.4.22-rcX, had created a patch that eliminates these warnings of
the code ntfs, which is sent it to Marcelo Tosatti so that it includes
it, but it said me that is sent it to you, and that you verify it and is
sent it to him.
for reference: 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106076494608869&w=2
(originaly without considering -DDEBUG and file fs.c)
Ok, this patch only fix warnings and no other modifications.
The warnings is "warning: concatenation of string literals with
__FUNCTION__ is deprecated" that appears 190 (with -DDEBUG) times,
and also fix this "warning: deprecated use of label at end of compound
statement" that appers one time in fs.h.
Please review, and confirm to Marcelo Tosatti, for include in the kernel
main line.
The syntax that uses to correct this, is the same one used in
kernel.
fixes:
dir.c 18 
fs.c 13+1
inode.c 85
super.c 74
total 191 warnings fixed!!! (it took enough hours to me)
Thanks in advance.
Take Care,
 djgera
(sorry my english)
