So I downloaded:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/alpha/cdrtools-2.01a35.tar.gz
and built it, ran scgcheck on a SCSI hard drive. And you pass in
->mx_sb_len == 16 to the sg driver, so that's why it's not copying more
than 16 bytes back to you. There are 18 available in that first test
case. Here's that test case:
Testing if at least CCS_SENSE_LEN (18) is supported...
Sense Data: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 24 00 00 C0 00 00
---------->     Method 0x00: expected: 18 reported: 16 max found: 16
Sense Data: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 24 00 00 C0 FF FF
---------->     Method 0xFF: expected: 18 reported: 16 max found: 16
---------->     Minimum standard (CCS) sense length failed
---------->     Wanted 18 sense bytes, got (16)
Testing for 32 bytes of sense data...

FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
---------->     Method 0xFF: expected: 32 reported: 16 max found: 16
---------->     Wanted 32 sense bytes, got (16)
----------> Got a maximum of 16 sense bytes
----------> SCSI sense count test FAILED
----------> SCSI status byte test NOT YET READY
Changing your scsi-linux-sg.c to set max sense to 64:
Testing if at least CCS_SENSE_LEN (18) is supported...
Sense Data: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 24 00 00 C0 00 03
---------->     Method 0x00: expected: 18 reported: 18 max found: 18
Sense Data: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 24 00 00 C0 00 03
---------->     Method 0xFF: expected: 18 reported: 18 max found: 18
---------->     Wanted 18 sense bytes, got it.
Testing for 32 bytes of sense data...
Sense Data: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 24 00 00 C0 00 03 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
---------->     Method 0x00: expected: 32 reported: 18 max found: 18
Sense Data: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 24 00 00 C0 00 03 FF FF
FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
---------->     Method 0xFF: expected: 32 reported: 18 max found: 18
---------->     Wanted 32 sense bytes, got (18)
----------> Got a maximum of 18 sense bytes
----------> SCSI sense count test PASSED
----------> SCSI status byte test NOT YET READY
and it passes just fine. What's the deal?
