You're right - I was looking at doing git-apply --stat --apply

The "cat" bit was in there to represent the perl script piping the
patch directly into the program - there isn't a literal "cat"
command in there. 8)

The problem is that git apply doesn't have a "patch -R" mode - so
if I want to revert such a patch (okay, there's only been one instance
so far) it means falling back to the old way.  So that code exists
one way or t'other.

Yes, that is where the confusion's happening.
Thanks for explaining it - the script's now fixed and appears to work
as desired.
akpm - I'm afraid the ARM devel tree has been regenerated almost from
scratch, so you might encouter some issues next time you pull it.
However, despite this issue, the end result appears to be idential
(git-diff-tree -u broken-devel devel shows no changes, but the
individual changes for each commit are now correct.)
