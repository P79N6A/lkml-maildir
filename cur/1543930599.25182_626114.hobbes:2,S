Thanks Shaohua, I tested this as well and it appears to have worked
around the issue for me.
Now, in dmesg, I get:
system 00:01: ioport range 0x290-0x29f has been reserved
(...)
system 00:01: ioport range 0x290-0x294 could not be reserved
In /proc/ioports I see:
0290-029f : pnp 00:01
  0290-0297 : it87
    0290-0297 : it87
The it87 sensor now works without disabling acpipnp
