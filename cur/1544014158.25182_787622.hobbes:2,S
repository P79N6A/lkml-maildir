Note; there is a serious bug in 2.6.28-ext4-2 due to a typo on my
part; said typo disables journalling entirely on ext4 filesystems.
Oops.  My bad; there was a missing "else" what should have read:
+      } if (test_opt(sb, NOLOAD) && !(sb->s_flags & MS_RDONLY) &&
So please don't use 2.6.28-ext4-2.  I will be releasing a
2.6.28-ext4-3 to fix this up, as well as one or two other problems and
documentation fix ups.
