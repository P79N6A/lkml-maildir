That is what people are arguing it is.  It is certainly a *potential*
security hole.  There are two possibilities:
a) Either flink() is harmless and we should be able to add it.
b) This is a security hole, in which case /proc needs to be fixed.  In
particular, the open("/proc/self/fd/3", O_RDWR) in my example above
should return EPERM.

You've clearly changed it around; the file descriptor should be 4.

You'd think, but it doesn't work that way.  By the way, I
get:
lr-x------    1 hpa      eng            64 Apr  7 07:54 3 ->
/home/hpa/flink/testdir/testfile
lrwx------    1 hpa      eng            64 Apr  7 07:54 4 ->
/home/hpa/flink/testdir/testfile
... not l-wx------ which would be an O_WRONLY file descriptor.
Personally I would prefer if open() on
/proc/*/fd would actually operate as if a dup() on the relevant file
descriptor, which would be a significant change of semantics; however,
one could argue those are the saner semantics.
