It depends...
Do you need to use OSes other than Linux?  FAT16/32 seems to be a pretty 
universal filesystem at this point.  You can mount ext2 on Windows, but it 
is a pain.  Not certain what it takes to mount it on OS X.
I have encountered flash drives that do not format well for anything other 
than FAT16, but they were old and small.  Hopefully that problem no longer 
exists with modern hardware.  I would format it then test the hell out of 
it before trusting it with important data.
