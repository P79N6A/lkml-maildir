It works better for SCTP, because the vtags are constant.  No
rehashing is required there.
But, also consider that rehashing is only required for senders
sending at a high data rate.  (http clients will likely never
have to be rehashed.)  These packets will typically be large and
per-packet overheads will be overwhelmed by per-byte overheads.
Also, the rehashing is orderly and simple, the entry is simply
bumped to the next sequential hash slot and the socket hash
structure can already be cached at the time the action is
performed.  Rehashing, although a bother, would take little
time, and could simply be added as part of TCP's existing window
calculations.

Under SCTP I still have the traditional established hash for
lookups of out of the blue packets and packets containing
invalid verification tags.  Really long lookups would invite DoS
attacks on these.

But you could throw away all 30 cycles, plus the stacking and
unstacking of registers to get in and out of the algorithm.
Some architectures might benefit more.
Well, I thought you might find it interesting.  Perhaps somebody
reading this will experiment with it.  For SCTP it is one of a
number of techniques that allows OpenSS7 SCTP to drastically
outperform lksctp.
