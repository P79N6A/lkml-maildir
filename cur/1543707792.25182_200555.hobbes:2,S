Yes, it's simply the (small) price that has to be paid in order to be able to 
boast about our accurate semantics.

How about just "all", which is what we mean.

Yes, it doesn't seem worth it just to save a stack frame.
Actually, I erred there in that invalidate_mmap_range should not export the 
flag, because it never makes sense to pass in non-zero from a DFS.

It does, thanks for the catch.  Please bear with me for a moment while I 
reroll this, then hopefully we can move on to the more interesting discussion 
of whether it's worth it.  (Yes it is :)

Daniel
