 I don't know what check you refer to, sorry.  I don't think we do any
version checks in the APIC code.  Perhaps ACPI does some, but having no
use for it anywhere I'm not familiar with that area.
 If the "nmi_watchdog=1" option doesn't work for a PII system, then its
most likely a bug in BIOS IRQ routing tables -- either missing or broken
entries for the 8254 timer and/or the 8259A ExtINTA source.
