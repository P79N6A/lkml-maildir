It means that rpc.statd did not manage to unmonitor the NFS locks
before it shut down. The reasons for this could be multiple, such as
for instance if the client crashed and/or rebooted. It might also
indicate that the server could not be contacted in order to unmonitor
the lock.

Means that the kernel was unable to contact rpc.statd, or that was
unable to contact the server's rpc.statd for some reason.

There is nothing in the above to suggest that this must be a kernel
problem. The fact that you are seeing files in /var/lib/nfs/sm
in these cases rather suggests that the problem lies with rpc.statd.
Can you see any reason in your setup why it should be failing?
