Please enable SLUB to work around this for now, SLAB wants
LARGE_ALLOCS enabled when it really shouldn't require that

Christoph, this is why I had to have LARGE_ALLOCS enabled on sparc64
all this time, for that MAX_OBJ_ORDER logic in mm/slab.c in order
to get 512K and 1MB slab caches usable.
This inconsistency is painful for platforms.  If I enable LARGE_ALLOCS
on sparc64 then SLAB works but it's a total waste for SLUB.
Right now if I enable LARGE_ALLOCS, SLUB will break again due to
that KMALLOC_SHIFT_HIGH bug we fixed the other week, Christophe
can you at least push that fix to Linus if you haven't already?
Thanks.
