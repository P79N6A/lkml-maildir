Hi,
your email program has line-wrapped the patches, which means they cannot
be applied with the patch command.
I see that you are using evolution; with evolution you can disable this
wrapping for a part of the email by clicking on the "Normal" thing just
above the text entry window, and set it to "Preformat".
Since you still have the patches correct on your machine, could you
resend them in "Preformat" mode? That makes it a lot easier for people
to do anything with them
Greetings,
