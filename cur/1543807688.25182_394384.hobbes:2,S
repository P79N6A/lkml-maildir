Hi!
I wanted to know if anybody can show me how to resolve
an issue with my system.
I am having some problem if I attach an Intel webcam
(model CS330) through a high speed hub (forgot the
name and model of the hub). Once I got the webcam
enumerated and run an application, like gnomemeeting,
the system just hangs. I looked at /var/log/messages/
but it does not get me much clues even after I have
turned USB verbose messaging, as well as, spca5xx
messaging already ON. It kinda stopped in a middle of
a reg_write in the spca5xx system.
Any ideas?
Best regards,
Grant
