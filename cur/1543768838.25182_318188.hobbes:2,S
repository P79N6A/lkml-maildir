Or just accept the fact that flashes are a tad different from spinning
rust.  Expecting a decent wear levelling on the cheap USB sticks and
other forms of flash is plain unrealistic.
USB stick are a bit better than old 3.5" floppies were - if both are
used with fat, minix, ext, etc.  At least they don't die by lying in a
dark drawer.  But if you want them to last, your best bet is currently
to use JFFS2 on them.
Of course, JFFS2 sucks performance-wise, so the end result currently
is that USB sticks suck in some way, no matter what you try.
