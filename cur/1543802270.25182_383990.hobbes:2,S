Brain is engaged now, thanks ;). If you find time, could you maybe 
compile a 2.4.32 kernel using following config (slightly changed from

http://www.drugphish.ch/patches/ratz/kernel/configs/config-2.4.32-chris_s
And put a dmidecode[1] output onto your website. Is the BMC interface 
enabled in your BIOS?
