So? Gcc does that anyway. _Any_ good compiler has to.
And if the compiler isn't good enough to do it, then the compiler 
shouldn't be warning about something that it hasn't got a clue about.

You're wrong.
Yes, when declaring an array, you cannot use "array[-1]". But that's not 
because the thing is unsigned: the standard says that the array 
declaration has to be a "integer value larger than zero". It is not 
unsigned: it's _positive_.
However, in _indexing_ an array (as opposed to declaring it), "array[-1]" 
is indeed perfectly fine, and is defined by the C language to be exactly 
the same as "*(array-1)". And negative values are perfectly fine, even for 
arrays. Trivial example:
	int x[2][2];
	int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
		return x[1][-1];
	}
the above is actually a well-defined C program, and 100%
standards-conforming ("strictly conforming").
