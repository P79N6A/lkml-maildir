Hi there...
Im wondering... does anyone have information on the care and feeding of
Decstation4000s ?
I have a DecStation 4000 (mips based, IIRC), which I would LOVE to run
Linux on.
It has no internal OS AFAICT, although it has a SCSI HDD, and some sort of
bootloader.
It used to boot over a network.
what do I need to do to make it boot linux?
