Fair enough. I was not aware of the various wait_event_*timeout()
functions. Thanks for beating me over the head with this. Kind of shoots
down my fancy patch though :) Here's one that at least corrects the
comment that made all of this happen...
-Nish
Description: The comment for msleep_interruptible() incorrectly asserts
that the function takes into consideration wait-queue interruptions. The
wait_event_*() family of functions should be used in those cases.
msleep_interruptible() is only to be used when sleeping waiting for
signals.
