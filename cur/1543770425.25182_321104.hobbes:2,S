If you cleanly separate the ability to send SCSI commands from the ability
to write to a UNIX block or raw devive, you only need to check the programs
that explicitly need to send SCSI commands.
In former times, Linux did have this kind of clean separation between
e.g. /dev/sd0 and /dev/sg0. Just go back to the clean old model...
This could easily be done: Remove SG_IO from the list of ioctl functions
supported by drivers like /dev/sd0 and /dev/hda fix the bugs in ide_scsi.
