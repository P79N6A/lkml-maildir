Hmm OK, beagleindexer. I thought beagle didn't need frequent reindexing
because of inotify? Oh well...

Kswapd will use CPU when memory is low, even if there is no swapping.
Your "buffers" grew by 600% (from 50MB to 350MB), and slab also grew
by a few thousand entries. This is not just a problem when it pushes
out swap, it will also harm filebacked working set.
This (which Ray's traces also show) is a bit of a problem. As Andrew
noticed, use-once isn't working well for buffer cache, and it doesn't
really for dentry and inode cache either (although those don't seem
to be as much of a problem on your workload).
Andrew has done a little test patch for this in -mm, but it probably
wants more work and testing. If you can test the -mm kernel and see
if things are improved, that would help.
