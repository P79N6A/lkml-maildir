Thank you for the details.  I'll try to stick to per-cpu wherever 
possible for now.
Anyway, what do you think about adding the above text to the code (percpu.h
maybe) as documentation?  See the patch below.  (Dunno if the Signed-off-by
line is appropriate as most of the text is yours.)

Kind regards.
