Hm.. documentation/kernel-parameters.txt says:
	maxcpus=	[SMP] Maximum number of processors that an SMP kernel
			should make use of.  maxcpus=n : n >= 0 limits the
			kernel to using 'n' processors.	 n=0 is a special case,
			it is equivalent to "nosmp", which also disables
			the IO APIC.
but documentation/cpu-hotplug.txt says:
maxcpus=n    Restrict boot time cpus to n. Say if you have 4 cpus, using
	     maxcpus=2 will only boot 2. You can choose to bring the
	     other cpus later online, read FAQ's for more info.
It used to be (implementation wise) that maxcpus doesn't influence the number
of possible cpus but just indicated how many cpus were brought online at startup
of the kernel. Which is what cpu-hotplug.txt describes.
Other present cpus would appear offline and could be brought online later.
For s390 I added the possible_cpus kernel parameter back then, since my
understanding back then was that maxcpus doesn't and shouldn't influence the
number of possible cpus:
possible_cpus=n		[s390 only] use this to set hotpluggable cpus.
			This option sets possible_cpus bits in
			cpu_possible_map. Thus keeping the numbers of bits set
			constant even if the machine gets rebooted.
Dunno... it all looks like a mess ;)
