# # Something changed, but it didn't fix it it seems:
# # 
# # # mdadm -C /dev/md1 --bitmap=/storage/raid1.bitmap -l1 -n2 /dev/loop0 --write-behind /dev/loop1
# # mdadm: RUN_ARRAY failed: No such file or directory
# 
# FWIW, the following happens when I point --bitmap to /tmp/raid1.bitmap
# which is tmpfs, and also happens when I attach both loop0 and loop1 to
# files on tmpfs.
# 
# This would suggest that reiser4 is not solely at fault?
# 
# The difference btw is that I can reboot with 'shutdown -r now'
# instead of sysrq. And that mdadm hangs:
# 
# # mdadm -C /dev/md1 --bitmap=/tmp/raid1.bitmap -l1 -n2 /dev/loop0 --write-behind /dev/loop1
# mdadm: RUN_ARRAY failed: No such file or directory
# 
# # mdadm -C /dev/md1 -f --bitmap=/tmp/raid1.bitmap -l1 -n2 /dev/loop0 --write-behind /dev/loop1
# mdadm: /dev/loop0 appears to be part of a raid array:
#     level=raid1 devices=2 ctime=Thu Nov 17 11:04:31 2005
# mdadm: /dev/loop1 appears to be part of a raid array:
#     level=raid1 devices=2 ctime=Thu Nov 17 11:04:31 2005
# Continue creating array? yes
# [hang, no prompt, no reaction to ctrl-c, etc]
And even more info. It seems mdadm spins:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND                                                             
  749 root      25   0  1696  568  492 R 99.9  0.1   8:32.50 mdadm
Would sysrq-t be useful?
