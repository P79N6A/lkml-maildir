There are two different kinds of Rhine problems that are reportedly fixed
by turning apic support off:
a) No link, card's dead in the water
b) Netdev watchdog triggered despite recent Tx abort fix
No telling whether the cause is the same for both cases. I don't have
sufficient data on mobos or chip sets involved and where linuxfet helps. As
I am currently short on APIC hardware myself, I'll focus on clean ups and
improved diagnostics for now.
