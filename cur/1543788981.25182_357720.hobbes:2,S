A small number of 486 systems use 25Mhz, some boards allow overclock at
37.5Mhz on the PCI. I've been looking at this the past couple of days
for the libata via driver which I've been porting over and unfortunately
having been through the Northbridge manuals I can find no way to ask the
chipset what the PCI clock is set too.
