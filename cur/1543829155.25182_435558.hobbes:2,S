Consider this scenario with what you're proposing:
	thread				irq
	take mutex
	get_mctrl
					cts changes state
					take port lock
					mctrl state read
					tty->hw_stopped changed state
					release port lock
	releaes mutex
	take port lock
	update tty->hw_stopped
	release port lock
Now, tty->hw_stopped does not reflect the hardware state, which will be
buggy and can cause a loss of transmission.
I'm not sure what to suggest on this one since for USB drivers you do
need to be able to sleep in this method... but for UARTs you must not.
