Ok, thanks, I'll add that to the nmi_watchdog code.

The comments on these are:
#define NOTIFY_DONE        0x0000        /* Don't care */
#define NOTIFY_OK        0x0001        /* Suits me */
#define NOTIFY_STOP_MASK    0x8000        /* Don't call further */
I'mt taking these to mean that NOTIFY_DONE means you didn't handle it, 
NOTIFY_OK means you did handle it, and you "or" on NOTIFY_STOP_MASK if 
you want it to stop.  I'm thinking that stopping is probably a bad idea, 
if the NMI is really edge triggered.

There's a comment in do_nmi() that says that the NMI is edge triggered. 
 If it is, then you have to call everything.  I'd really like a manual 
on how the timer chip works, I'll see if I can hunt one down.
