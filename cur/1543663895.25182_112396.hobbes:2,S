Right now there are some other problems with gcc-3.3 too, ie the inlining
is apparently broken enough that we'll either have to start using
__attribute__((force_inline)) or we'd better hope that the gcc people
decide to take the "inline" keyword more seriously (it's being discussed
on the gcc lists, so we'll see)
But yes, these are all obviously with "early versions", and it may be that 
it changes before the real release.
