We try to avoid really long running softirqs (RCU tasklet in this case)
for better scheduling latency. A long running rcu tasklet during
an idle cpu may delay running of an RT process that becomes runnable
during the rcu tasklet.

Unfortunately, we aren't there yet. But it is in my TODO list for a 
generic nohz system.
