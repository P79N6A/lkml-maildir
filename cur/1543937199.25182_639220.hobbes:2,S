Hi Eric,
I'm still getting this message with the numa=fake=4 start option:
Faking node 0 at 0000000000000000-0000000028000000 (640MB)
Faking node 1 at 0000000028000000-0000000050000000 (640MB)
Faking node 2 at 0000000050000000-0000000078000000 (640MB)
Faking node 3 at 0000000078000000-000000009ff00000 (639MB)
NUMA: Using 27 for the hash shift.
Your memory is not aligned you need to rebuild your kernel
with a bigger NODEMAPSIZE shift=27 No NUMA hash function found.
NUMA emulation disabled.
Is there something else I need to change?  (This is on an AMD box.)
Thanks!
Mike
