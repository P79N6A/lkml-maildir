There's no requirement to give you full access to the machine.  If you
don't like that, don't buy it.

If they use some modules of their own writing, the general agreement
seems to be that they don't need to release the source code to those.
They should still give you the kernel source they used, along with any
patches they may have applied.

I'm having some problems myself with an STB manufacturer (Amino).  The
STB is running a Busybox/Montavista Linux of some kind, and I need to
make some changes.  To do this, they tell me I need the SDK, which is
only available under NDA, and then only after purchasing a support
contract for an ungodly number of dollars.  Somehow, I get the feeling
they are on thin ice here.
