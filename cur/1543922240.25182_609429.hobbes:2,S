Those are important questions, no doubt.  However, that does not
address Simon's question.  Especially in light of Linus' statement:
 "I'm also perfectly willing to unapply it if there actually are
  valid out-of-tree users that people push for not merging."
It seems that, whether submitted (and or accepted) into the kernel
or not, Simon has the obligation to respond to Linus' challenge.
