Hi,
I have compiled 'chown' (in fileutils, statically linked and stripped)
on an i686 box and tried to run it on i586 box.
I need to understand why
this one fails:
root:/# /bin/chown root:daemon try 
Illegal instruction (core dumped)
but this one succeed:
root:/# /bin/chown root:root try
Also, in general, how can I tell an i686 binary from
an i586 binary (or lower). Tool /usr/bin/file does
not help much.
Thanks,
-T
