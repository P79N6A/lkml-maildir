Ok. Let's just make the masking explicit in in_atomic() then, like you 
suggest:

I don't think this is a scheduler cleanliness issue: it's a consistency
issue. If "in_interrupt()" and friends do not care about PREEMPT_ACTIVE,
then neither should "in_atomic()".  The fact that the scheduler test gets
cleaned up is secondary - although it is obviously a result of being
consistent.

Hmm.. It will call wake_up() because it will try to wake up any klogd. 
What's the problem? Calling wake_up() should be fine from there..
