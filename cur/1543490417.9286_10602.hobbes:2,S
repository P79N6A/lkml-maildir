Do they claim how many sectors?
I bet they don't.  A lot of the better disks split up the disk in
"regions", and have a variable number of sectors: more sectors on the
outer edge where there is more room, etc. 
Density is important to modern disks, and as long as disks rotate you
will have a property where the outer tracks have more space.
Quite frankly, anybody who even _thinks_ he knows how the disk is
organized is living in the past.  Give up on it, and just consider it a
linear array of sectors.  Anything else just amounts to repeatedly
hitting yourself on the head with a virtual icepick, and is just about
as useful. 
Just say no to unnecessary complexity that just doesn't buy you
anything.  Linux uses a one-way scheduler for many good reasons, not the
least of which are that it is fair and that it is simple. 
The same goes for filesystems: trying to optimize the filesystem for
some random number of sectors per track is just stupid these days.
