Im currently using vesa for X, I would like to get some kind of acceleration
to play DVD's etc. I've tried the sis_drv in X 4.1 with the lavalamp
style effect i mentioned, the sis driver in X3.x gets the screen offset
totally wrong, ie the center of the screen is on the far right of the
physical screen, but this is a problem i can direct to the X lists.

This is on 2.4.13-ac8, sisfb also messes up the screen offset,
CONFIG_AGP_SIS is turned off as Configure.help mentions it doesn't
support the 5591/5592.

This is an "Advent 5490", which i think is Pc-World(tm)'s own brand name
they've applied to an oem laptop made by someone else, but i could have
this the wrong way around/totally wrong. It's a 900mhz celeron (coppermine), 
SiS everything.
Im sure other laptops with different badges on them will have the same
internals.

I've mailed SiS asking them if they have any support planned, no reply
as yet, heres to hoping...

Everything else (except the software modem, which i have no use for)
worked straight out of the tin with RedHat 7.2's vanilla kernel. Im
current using Alans 2.4.13-ac8:
/sbin/modprobe trident
Trident 4DWave/SiS 7018/ALi 5451,Tvia CyberPro 5050 PCI Audio, version
0.14.9d,
23:06:41 Nov 11 2001
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:01.4
PCI: Sharing IRQ 11 with 00:03.0
trident: SiS 7018 PCI Audio found at IO 0xd400, IRQ 11
ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x414c:0x4710 (ALC200/200P)
ac97_codec: AC97 Modem codec, id: 0x5349:0x4c22 (Silicon Laboratory
Si3036)
It works perfectly, as does the NIC.
Cheers, Gavin Baker
