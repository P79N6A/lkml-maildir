I just installed 2.6.15-gentoo-5, so I have a much more recent kernel.
 This strange behavior still happens.  I forgot to mention that I'm
using this on an P4, and the kernel is compiled 64-bit.
I sent Ben a copy of the whole dmesg output.  Here's the portion that
everyone else might be interested in:
