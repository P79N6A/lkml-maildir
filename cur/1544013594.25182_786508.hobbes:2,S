We've done measurements and for modern NCQ/TCQ disks the performance
for cache off vs cache on + barriers is close.  For ext3 barriers is
generally slightly faster, and for XFS it's even or sometimes even cache
off is faster depending on the workload.

The thing is that there's no reason for that at all with just a single
underlying disk.  There is absolutely no reason for not passing through
barriers, and there's also no reason why it should be any slower than
our most trivially volume manager, the partition remapping code.  In
fact there's no reason trivial device mapper tables couldn't be handled
by the partition remapping code..
