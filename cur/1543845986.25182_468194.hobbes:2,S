I fail to see which column you mean.
#TH perhaps? I think, that can be calculated under linux by
 (a) counting the directories in /proc/22429/task using readdir
or
 (b) get the nlink of /proc/22429/task and subtract 2, which should give 
     the same as (a), and, better than (a), should also be atomic
