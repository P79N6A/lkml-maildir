Not really, suspending doesn't work at all on my other notebook it
just freezes..
I'm basically trying to get that driver work on my eee PC [1], it's
cheap and tiny so I don't expect anything special in there..
The system is preloaded with Xandros (it's debian etch with a few
custom applications) and linux 2.6.21.4.
The system still locks up, although only if I leave the video
application running during suspending. I don't have to reload the
driver anymore after resuming if the video node doesn't get accessed
(I'm looking for races in the uvc driver at the moment).
thanks,
Markus
