I don't have the IDE TCQ options on and am still having an issue with a
kernel oops in the default kernel code.  I did some digging after  I
noticed it in 2.5.43 and found a possibility for a null pointer in the
code within the ide_iomio_dma function in ide-dma.c The problem shows
itself if you only enable the secondary channel of your IDE controller. 
I understand this is a strange set up, but it could happen in a machine
that boots off of SCSI and uses IDE disks for DATA or a CD Burner. I
came up with a fix, some extra sanity checks before this line in the
code:
hwif->dma_master = (hwif->channel) ? hwif->mate->dma_base : base;
Because it is the hwif->mate variable that is null when it gets here and
if hwif->channel is not 0 I am taking it from the logic on this line
that hwif->mate should not be a null variable.  So I applied the sainity
checks in the attached patch and this seems to work.  I did this against
the 2.5.43 and 2.5.44 kernels, and have posted patches for each of them
but no one seems interested.  If I am completely off base here, just let
me know and I'll go back to the code and look for a different way to
conquer this little bug.
