I suspect here is a slight misunderstanding: It will never be possible
to switch a kernel with a hibernation/resume cycle.
The new thing is, that you can use a 2.6.24-SLUB-kernel to load a
2.6.12-SLAB-kernel(*) and then have the *2.6.12* kernel continue to
run.
The jump that Rafael talks about is a complete switchover from the
kernel doing the resume to the old kernel (and all of its data
structures) from the hibernation image. The now again running old
kernel will discard any internal data from the resuming kernel and so
it is not important if there was a SLAB vs SLUB difference.
In some way you could see the kernel loading the image as a gigantic
bootloader and just as is does not matter if you use lilo or grub it
should no longer matter what bootloader/kernel was used for resuming,
now that a ABI for the resume has been defined.

different kernel versions was only merge recently.
