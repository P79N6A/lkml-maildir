No.  Kernel accesses to pages in the user portion of the address space
(0 .. TASK_SIZE-1) are done using the user permissions.  On classic
PPC this is implemented (in part) by setting Ks = Kp = 1 in the
segment descriptors for the user segments, which tells the hardware to
check the access as if it was a user access even in supervisor mode.
We do the same on ppc64 as well.

If you do find a ppc32 or ppc64 machine where the write succeeds
instead of returning EFAULT, let me know please.
