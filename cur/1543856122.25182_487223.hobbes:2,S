These counters depend on CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS.
The Kconfig comment for CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS states:
          VM event counters are only needed to for event counts to be
          shown. They have no function for the kernel itself. This
          option allows the disabling of the VM event counters.
          /proc/vmstat will only show page counts.
(By the way - note the "needed to for event" phrasing error.)
The header file, include/linux/vmstat.h, for these counters states:
	/*
	 * Light weight per cpu counter implementation.
	 *
	 * Counters should only be incremented and no critical kernel component
	 * should rely on the counter values.
Both these clearly state that I should not use these counters for real
kernel functions.
If that is so, I should find some other "time base" for the zonelist
caching.
If that is not so, then these comments need updating.
Anybody have any idea which is the case?
