Sure, and we do not have any demand for higly skilled, motivated kernel
developers ? If redhat wouldn't have employed then somebody else would
and maybe redhat wouldn't be in the situation of having access to their
knowledge and their support when it comes to really tricky solutions.
I don't think your point holds. They do not employ the developers out of
pure altruism. They have a knowledgetransfer and they can use that for
their support. They do earn their money with consulting. Or least to
say, that is where the real money should come from.
Greetings
Michael
