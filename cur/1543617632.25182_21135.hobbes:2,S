0xf0 shouldn't lead to an oom killing, there should be some other failure
before the killing. The above are normal warnings, they're KERN_NOTICE,
not KERN_WARNING nor KERN_ERROR.

That means there wasn't enough memory, sounds like your bootup
sequence is broken and startup something big before activating swap,
either that or you start something that takes more than 16+4m, note that
with any recent distribution it is very easy that you need 16+4 after a
little time after boot.
If you could provide a vmstat trace during the VM killing, that could
show better if the VM is the culprit or if it did the right thing.
I know for experience at the first VM killing people tends to point
the finger at the VM (me too sometime at first, see the pte-highmem
thread) but at least in my tree that never turned out to be the case
yet.

Can you try to boot with emergency, then activate swap, and then check
if it runs oom again despite lots of free swap available etc...? thanks,
