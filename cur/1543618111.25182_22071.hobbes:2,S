 Have you verified this empirically?  AFAIK, the intended way for the ESR
to work is to update upon write and clear upon read.  Now there are
various errata within specific implementations, but our code seems immune
to them (except from the Pentium case we handle explicitly), i.e. the
ESR's value as fetched by the handler is correct.  The value outside the
handler may be meaningless, but who cares?

 The "noapic" option only affects I/O APICs.  Local APICs get programmed
anyway.
