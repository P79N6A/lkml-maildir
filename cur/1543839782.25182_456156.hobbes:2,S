I am wondering why this new api didn't cleanup the pfn_to_nid code
path as well. Arches are left to still keep another set of
nid-start-end info around. We are sending info like
add_active_range(unsigned int nid, unsigned long start_pfn, unsigned
long end_pfn)
With this info making a common pnf_to_nid seems to be of intrest so we
don't have to keep redundant information in both generic and arch
specific data structures.
Are you intending the hot-add memory code path to call add_active_range or ???
Thanks,
  Keith
