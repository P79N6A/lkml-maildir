Interface wise there are per user credentials that need to remain with
the written data.  These credentials by there very nature are per
file.
Last I heard the current interface was only a rough approximation of
correct in that it is wrong if you are caching data and you have
multiple people writing per file.
So definitely at the top level you should have a struct file
so that the credentials needed can be computed.  As things
filter down it may be possible to change that.
