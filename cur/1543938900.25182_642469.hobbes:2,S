Subject: [PATCH] W1: w1_therm.c standardize units to millidegrees C
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/23/459

Here is the patch to standardize the temperature units to millidegrees
C for the two sensor conversion routines.  Previously the routines
were,
w1_DS18B20_convert_temp degrees C
w1_DS18S20_convert_temp millidegrees C
Unfortunately this will break any program using the ds18b20 value as
it will now be 1000 times bigger.  Fortunately there can't be that
many users out there, or some of these bugs will have been fixed by
now, such as the negative C error (see previous patch) that makes me
think the ds18b20 is the better choice to change because of the
current bugs.
