it sounds like what you want to do is change the root device.  use rdev to
change that (as is described in nfsroot.txt).  the kernel, though, doesn't
load the remainder of the kernel; it tries to mount the root device.  this
doesn't explain the 8000 (ahem) error messages, though.  when a kernel can't
mount the root device you usually get something like this (i'm doing this
from memory, excuse the wrong wording):
VFS: No such device 02:00
Kernel panic.
after which, you will find no more error messages.
for the original poster: what exactly is displayed on screen (i.e. how far
does it get?).  is it immediately after it uncompresses the image, or what? 
and what is the exact wording of the error message?
