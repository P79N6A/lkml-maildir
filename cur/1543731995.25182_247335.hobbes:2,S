I think that porting all file systems to LUFS is a mad idea :), 
but providing a facility in the kernel for user-space file system 
implementations could be great.
I am working on PackageFS (
http://packagefs.sourceforge.net
)
which is an user-space file system to manage packages:
it relies on LUFS, but I plan to port it soon to FUSE ( 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf
)
that, at present, is maintained by Miklos Szeredi and works with latest kernels.
PackageFS relies also on existent package managers, it will be transparent to all
package formats. I. e.: you can install a package by copying, 
and see package informations by a simple cat.
Now it works only in Debian distro, and it is far from complete (it is 0.09 version :) ).
So, what do you think about including a kernel module to make a user able 
to develop, install and use an user-space file system ?
Maybe Miklos Szeredi will write more details about FUSE which is the interesting part
for kernel inclusion.
Bye
Luca
