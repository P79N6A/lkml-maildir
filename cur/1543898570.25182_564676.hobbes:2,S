But on an 8K stack.  If you pretend to be on a 4K stack, and take 4K
away from that, those numbers are 100s of bytes away from eating the
stack.

We don't use very much of libc on kernel stacks.  Also, various things
have been done to reduce stack usage.  We no longer initialize kernel
stacks with a signal frame on them.  We now have IRQ stacks.  I've
also done some amount of general stack usage reduction.  I haven't
seen anything come very close to running out of stack.
