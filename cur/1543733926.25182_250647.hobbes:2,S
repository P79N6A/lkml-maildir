PCI: Found IRQ 5 for device 00:12.0
PCI: Sharing IRQ 5 with 00:10.0
The machine is a VIA Nehemiah CPU with:
    Ethernet controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6102 [Rhine-II] (rev 116).
      IRQ 5.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=3.Max Lat=8.
      I/O at 0xe400 [0xe4ff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xea001000 [0xea0010ff].
  Bus  1, device   0, function  0:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
eth0: Transmit timed out, status 1003, PHY status 786d, resetting...
eth0: Setting full-duplex based on MII #1 link partner capability of 45e1.
And of course no network connectivity.. without ACPI it all just works.  I
should have this hardware for a few more weeks if anyone wants to diagnose
it further.
