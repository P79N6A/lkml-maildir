Hi,
I'm trying to run a new (self-compiled) 2.4.21 kernel on my Acer
Notebook with Ali15x3 Chipset, revision 195 (C3) and experience a
freeze upon bootup at the partition check.
Kernel version <= 2.4.18 works fine on my laptop (including dma), all
kernels > 2.4.18 lock up at boot.
The partition check line shows: 
Partition check:
hda1 hda2 hda3 hda4 <
before it freezes. 
With the working 2.4.18 kernel the line shows:
Partition check:
hda1 hda2 hda3 hda4 <hda5 hda6>
hda5 and hda6 are swap and the main partition
respectively, running a reiserfs. 
I checked the mailing list and found some hints for 2.4.19 kernels,
but that bug doesn't seem to apply as my chipset revision is < C4,
apart from that it seems to be fixed in /drivers/ide/pci/alim15x3.c
Any ideas?
Please cc the mail to me. I tried to subscribe to the list an hour ago
but didn't get any reply yet.
Thanx,
Orm
