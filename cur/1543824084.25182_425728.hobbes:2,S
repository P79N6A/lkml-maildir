I did it allready, and it looks like solves the problem.
Yesterday i have more than 6 random reboots, and after i set from 3800 to
16000 the min free limit, i have none at this point. :-)
 15:51:45 up  7:21,  1 user,  load average: 0.85, 0.79, 0.67
Anyway, i interested about cache/buffer mechanism, because i have some
performance problems too, and i can see, these systems wastes the half of
memory instead of speeds up the operation.
Thanks,
Janos
