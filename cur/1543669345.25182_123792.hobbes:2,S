yes - at least "HP Designed" chipsets do.

I interpret "practice" as equivalent to "implementation" in this context.
I hedge by saying "HP designed" because HP tried to sell Intel itanic
boxes until current mckinley boxes became available. And SGI, IBM,
and other vendors are designing their own "high end" ia64 chipsets.
(eg NEC Azusa - 16 CPU itanic).
parisc firmware (both Legacy and PAT PDC) and current IA64 firmware number
the PCI busses.  I didn't want the parisc-linux implementation to
reprogram PCI Bus numbers because:
o lack of PCI Segment support (which I'm glad to see willy is fixing)
o the "view" of devices from both firmware and linux should match.
card-mode dino (PCI controller on GSC HBA) is the only exception where
firmware has no clue about the PCI controller.
hth,
