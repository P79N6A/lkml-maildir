Well, 8 times less cr3 reloads may be significant... for the copy
loop. Speeding up copy loop that takes  ... 100msec?... of whole
resume (30 seconds) does not seem too important to me.

It did not seem too much better to me.

Reason is "to crash it early if we have wrong pagetables".

I think it is just not worth the effort.
