Ehh .. no .. probably wouldn't be nice, but you cat do stuff like that on any
OS, so that doesn't really matter.
For my case, i would be glad if I just could do 802.11b on these cards right
now. 802.11g and 802.11a would be nice though.
However, if it is like that (the chip supports all frequencies), that would
mean, that a TrueMobile 1300 and TrueMobile 1400 practically is the same card.
(TM1300: 802.11b/g, TM1400: 802.11a/b/g)
Another thing about the TM1400 is, that it has 2 MAC adresses, but that's
probably due to, that 802.11a operates on another frequency than 802.11b/g (one
MAC is assigned to 802.11a, the other one to 802.11g).
