hm.  Kernel violates proper read() semantics in many places.  Looks like we
just did it again.

oic, yes, that thing.  Usually we'd zero out the on-stack struct, assemble
it then copy out the whole thing.  I guess doing it the way you have saves
a few instructions.  But it's the cache hit against *uinfo which will have
most of the cost, and we can't do anything about that.
Unless we just remove the __clear_user() altogether.  Who said that "Unused
memebers should be zero"?
