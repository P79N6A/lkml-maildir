Hi Jordan,
Sorry it took so long for me to respond.

I think your phrase "somewhat sane BIOS" sums up the problem nicely.
I threw in the UART1 config because UART2 has problems. Paranoia.
I'm not sure that the UART1 config is needed, so I'm willing to scrap
it, or wrap it in a config option.
If you are interested in my experience with UART2, see the kernel
buzilla report #5677.

I'm curious as to what trouble this could cause?

Your patch looks like it would also solve the UART2 problem.
What I still don't understand is why UART2 works fine in DOS and in
linux 2.6.13-rc6-mm1, but not in the current kernel - in short, why is
this needed?
My guess (not based on any data) is that a BIOS call (initiated by
Linux) uses the DDC, but doesn't restore the GPIO to its original
state. So, again, a BIOS problem.
Anyway, I recommend adding sanity checks on MSR_DIVIL_GLD_CAP and
MSR_LBAR_GPIO before writing to the IO port.  The code as-is may cause
problems on a non-cs5535 board.

I agree that PCI would work much cleaner.
I plan to revisit the GPIO & SMB drivers and get them to use PCI, but
that may not happen for a while.

Thanks for your input.
