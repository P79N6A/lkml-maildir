Subject: 2.2.1 - Toshiba Tecra Bug Again

An interesting one:
I compiled 2.2.1 twice on my machine (Toshiba Tecra 780 DVD), onve with
gcc 2.7.2.3 and once with "gcc version egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3
release)".
The gcc version boots and runs fine.
The egcs version says "uncompressing kernel" and halts!
Both were bzImages.
This seems to be the old Tecra bug again, but why should it depend on
the compiler since that bit of code is supposed to be in assembler
anyway?
(For those who don't remember:  The bzImage boot code uses the keyboard
controller to get access to 'high memory' in real mode, and it wasn't
waiting long enough for the Tecra's incredibly slow keyboard controller
to do its work.  The Tecra keyboard controller is slow enough to make
most Windows action games, especially Unreal, unplayable!  I can't type
fast enough to cause it a problem, though.)
