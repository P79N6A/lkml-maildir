2.6.21.4-rt12 boots on 4-CPU Opteron and passes several hours of
rcutorture.  However, if I simply do "modprobe rcutorture", the kernel
threads do not spread across the CPUs as I would expect them to, even
given CFS.  Instead, the readers all stack up on a single CPU, and I
have to use the "taskset" command to spread them out manually.  Is there
some config parameter I am missing out on?
						Thanx, Paul
