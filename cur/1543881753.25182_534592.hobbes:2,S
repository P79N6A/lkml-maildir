i've got several SMP systems with CFS and all distribute the load 
properly to all CPUs, so it would be nice if you could tell me more 
about how the problem manifests itself on your system.
for example, if you start two infinite loops:
    for (( N=0; N < 2; N++ )); do ( while :; do :; done ) & done
do they end up on the same CPU?
Or do you mean that the default placement of single tasks starts at 
CPU#0, while with mainline they were alternating?
