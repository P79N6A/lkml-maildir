1 - didn't try, I checked that the patch had not been reverted, and
    assumed that if it was broken and not changed it was broken still.
    And I only looked in pre2-ac2, if it was fixed and Alan patched it
    back broken.
2 - understanding vast stretches of uncommented code you may need to
    change is worthwhile reading. The corolary is that comments are worthwhile
    typing.
  I'll try to build a plain 19-pre2 kernel after I do a diff with the
2.4.18 to see that something has really changed. Thanks.
