The machine that I'm using is relatively fast, but on slower machine
it's possible to reproduce this same hang just by running,
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency
then pressing enter a few times .. Which would be a fairly common
happening with people using latency tracing an a serial port I would
imagine..
The other fix I test was using the hack for sysrq,
        if (up->port.sysrq || oops_in_progress)
in serial8250_console_write to then also check "irqs_disabled()" , but
I'm sure mass usage of the serial port would cause some issues with
that.. Although both fixes I tested resulted in the serial port becoming
garbled after about 10 min. with the preempt_thresh at 1 .
