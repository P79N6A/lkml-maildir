Or a refcounted struct cred. Which would be needed for strict POSIX thread
semantics likely anyways. But there never was enough incentive to go down
that path and it would be likely somewhat slow.

AFAIK (Trond will hopefully correct me if I'm wrong) in the special case of 
NFS there isn't much problem because the server does the (passive) authentication
and there is no background writeback from server to client. The client just 
does the usual checks at open time and then forgets about it. The server
threads don't have own credentials but just check those of others.
I can't think of any cases where you would need to do authentication
in the client for every read() or write() 
Overall the arguments for reusing current don't seem to be strong to me.
