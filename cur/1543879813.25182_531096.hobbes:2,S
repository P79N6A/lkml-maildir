Why? With current battery class we can do whatever everyone needs. No
need for wrappers.
Adding new properties is cheap and easy. Simple batteries using only
"simple" properties/attributes, and complicated batteries using
complicated attributes.
Because of your original design, simple batteries are stay simple, and
no noticing that there is some "complicated" attributes exists at all.
That's indeed great characteristic of that *universal* battery class.
For example, ds2760 is not really "simple" monitoring chip. ADC battery
is (it's in -hh tree so far). So, ds2760 is somewhere in between SBS
design, and dumb ADC batteries.
So, my another purposal, which I very like now:
Let's do self-documented properties. current_now, current_avg, e.t.c.
No more just "current", lets remove any ambiguousness!
