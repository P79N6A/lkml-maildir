The 2.6.11.1 source doesn't line up with your line numbers so I can't 
say. You'll have to see whether it's stuffing a 64 bit number into a 32 
bit number or vice versa and see if that will cause problems. I don't 
get those error messages when I compile the kernel so maybe someone put 
a cast in or fixed something. There are still plenty of warnings about 
uninitialized variable and so on which I would feel more comfortable not 
seeing. 111 the last time.
