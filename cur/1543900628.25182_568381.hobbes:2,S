We already have rudimentary multi-block size support via the
per-inode extent size hint, but we still cache based on the
filesystem block size ('coz we can't increase it).
All I want is to be able to change the index granularity in the page
cache with minimal impact and everything in XFS falls almost
straight out in a pretty optimal manner.

That's crap. Just because a machine has lots of memory does not
make it OK to waste lots of memory.
Cheers,
