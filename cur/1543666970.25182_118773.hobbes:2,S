True...for large files it'd be nice to know if you have the correct
tarball _before_ spending all that CPU time decompressing it.  It's a
trade off, mostly, CPU time for more generic useage.  I know this isn't
the Right Way(TM), but since fast computers are becoming fairly cheap, I
say the signature on the .tar file is a good way to go.  However, Linux
also runs sufficiently well on slow machines, and this would just make
them slower.  Shall we just follow the path of least resistence and keep
it as is?
