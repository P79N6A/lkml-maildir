We can do this using a few environment options.
Somewhere in a Makefile:
export CC_MAJOR=`magic`
export CC_MINOR=`more magic`
And in a Kconfig file:
config CC_MAJOR
	string
	option env=CC_MAJOR
And then we can do:
config CC_DEFAULT_INLINE
	bool "Force inline of functions annotated inline"
	default y if CC_MAJOR = 04
Shall I try to cook up a patch for this?
