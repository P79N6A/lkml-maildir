I'm not quite sure I follow, when the timer is running no signal should be 
queued, so nothing can be dequeued and no new timer can be requeued.
If that somehow is possible (although I don't see how), you'd found a bug 
in the signal/posix timer code, which should not be worked around in the 
hrtimer run queue.
bye, Roman
