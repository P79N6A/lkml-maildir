Hi Ted,
nice that you replied. It's a fact: Same application, same hardware, 
only Linux 2.2.0 instead of 2.0.36, and things no longer work. 
Setting CTS and clearing DTR also works in 2.2.0.
(I had reported the problem before: Without the change, the driver 
receives on FIFO full (10 characters in my case) every 10 seconds 
(it's the STROBE timeout) because I'm having one pulse per second.

During initialization both DTR and CTS are set. My program plays with 
TIOCMBIS and TIOCMBIC after the port is open, and it's definitely 
true that the receive interrupts are not enabled then.
As soon as I have some spare time, I'll redo the experiments. Wait 
for a while (if you can't believe it)...
Regards,
Ulrich
