The maintainers last patch to SLOB was the initial submission of the 
allocator. Then he acked subsequent patches. Most of the modifications to 
SLOB are my work. Attempts to talk to the maintainer result in inventive 
explanations why SLOB does not have to conform to kernel standards. There 
is no reasonable expectation that this will change.
