Third party? What are you talking about? Is the same maintainer and 
everything, anyway. I was just reporting.
And notice, he is CC'd as well as the IPW ML.
Then again, It works like a charm with the previous built-on-monday 
kernel from linux-2.6 git.
Something was done that broke the ipw2200 just like the in kernel hdaps, 
I'm just reporting, not complaining.
