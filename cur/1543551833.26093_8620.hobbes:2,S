In the interest of fixing this problem in a way that is portable to
other operating systems, the best long-term solution seems to be to
just remove the /proc support and provide similar support via the
existing ioctl interface.  Other OSs need this anyway, and there's
really no good reason to have the support duplicated if it interacts
poorly with /proc support in recent kernels.  (And I don't think the
amount of information is sufficient to justify a drmfs that folks will
have to mount.)
