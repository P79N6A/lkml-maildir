Hi,
I run the checkpatch.pl against the attache file and it reported some
confusing warning and error messages. The attached file has an obsoleted
syntax:
From "info gcc", Chapter 5.21 "Designated Initializers":
>  In a structure initializer, specify the name of a field to initialize
> with `.FIELDNAME =' before the element value.  For example, given the
> following structure,
>
>      struct point { int x, y; };
>
> the following initialization
>
>      struct point p = { .y = yvalue, .x = xvalue };
>
> is equivalent to
>
>      struct point p = { xvalue, yvalue };
>
>  Another syntax which has the same meaning, obsolete since GCC 2.5, is
> `FIELDNAME:', as shown here:
>
>     struct point p = { y: yvalue, x: xvalue };
However, the checkpatch.pl speaks about labels, which are incorrect, I think:
> $ /usr/src/linux/scripts/checkpatch.pl --file test.c
> WARNING: labels should not be indented
> #5: FILE: test.c:5:
> +       open: test_open,
>
> ERROR: spaces required around that ':' (ctx:VxW)
> #6: FILE: test.c:6:
> +       release: test_close,
>                ^
>
