	If you only have one writer, why not have the writer update an MD5 checksum
in the file along with the datawrite? If the reader sees an invalid
checksum, it repeats the read. This is simple, elegant, and foolproof. The
only possible flaw would be if you found two data sets with the same MD5
checksum. The instant fame would be well worth the inconvenience. ;)
