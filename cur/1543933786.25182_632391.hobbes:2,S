This patchset is intended to replace the ones currently in the MM tree:
	generic-gpio-gpio_chip-support.patch
	generic-gpio-gpio_chip-support-fix.patch
	generic-gpio-gpio_chip-support-gpiolib-locking-simplified.patch
	avr32-uses-gpio_chip.patch
	mcp23s08-spi-gpio-expander.patch
	mcp23s08-spi-gpio-expander-checkpatch-fixes.patch
	arm-pxa-gpiolib-support.patch
	arm-pxa-gpiolib-support-make-pxa_gpio_chip-static.patch
Changes since the version in mm include:  merging the various fixlets;
adding drivers for two I2C based GPIO expanders; and (the main reason
for replacement patches vs incremental ones) moving all non-platform
code into the new drivers/gpio directory.  Also, it now uses a new
internal "struct gpio_desc" abstraction -- somewhat visible to the
GPIO providers since ARCH_GPIOS_PER_CHIP is now gone.  All those
changes were posted previously.
Patches in this set are:
	- Add empty drivers/gpio directory and kconfig/kbuild support.
          Before this kicks in, platform support is needed.
	- Core gpiolib support.  Merges various updates as previously
	  discussed, notably simpler locking, the gpio_desc stuff (from
	  Eric Miao); and moving this from "lib" to "drivers/gpio".
	- Documentation/gpio.txt updates.
	- AVR32 platform support (at32ap)
	- PXA platform support (from Philipp Zabel, essentially unchanged)
	- PCF 857x I2C GPIO expander support ... a pretty widely used
	  family of "quasi-bidirectional" GPIOs (8 or 16 bits, many speeds)
	- MCP 23S08 SPI GPIO expander support ... with more traditional
	  push/pull outputs and hi-Z inputs
	- PCA 9539 I2C GPIO expander support ... a sixteen bit expander
	  using push/pull outputs etc (from Eric Miao)
	- Deprecate the older (unused) PCA9539 driver (from Eric Miao)
