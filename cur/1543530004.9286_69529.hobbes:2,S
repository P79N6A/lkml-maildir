Why not abort when adding two ints then? Just as much a part of C then
assigning structures...

Adding a memcpy() in a library for the kernel's use is much less intrusive.
OTOH, I don't know what a freestanding compiler is allowed to assume in
terms of availability of libc functions. There are two parties to be fixed:
The kernel must provide a freestanding environment (whatever that means)
and the compiler has to abide by it.
