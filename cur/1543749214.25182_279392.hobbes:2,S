But the interrupts are assigned early in the process, right?  We still
need to do that.

Ah, what's wrong with a little breakage :)

Why would it matter if we export this info to userspace?  Do any
userspace programs care about this information?

It looks good.  What's the main goals of this redesign (for those of us
who are old and forgot what you said at the last kernel summit...)
