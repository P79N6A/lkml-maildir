You mean, a software problem or a hardware problem?
One way to find out is to try going back to an earlier kernel.  When you
do, do these cycles continue to appear?
I'm not aware of any software problem that would show up like this.  
However, if you find that the cycles go away with an older kernel then you 
should build 2.6.11-mm4 with CONFIG_USB_DEBUG turned on.  That's the best 
way to start looking for clues.
