Same goes for me - I've got a PAS-16 running 2.2.0-pre8-ac1 and I'm
getting the same.  Mixer at 100%, amplified speakers at 100%, and it
sounds as if I'd just turned the volume down because someone came into the
room and wanted to tell me to answer the phone... Very quiet.  I didn't
have a chance to notice any differences between circa 2.1.131 and
2.2.0-pre7 because I had a SB AWE64 then.  Alas, I am back to my tried and
true PAS for now.  The AWE64 worked great, though!
