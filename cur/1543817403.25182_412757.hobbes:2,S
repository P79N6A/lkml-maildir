Subject: [RFC] sched.c : procfs tunables

Proper scheduling in a multi-tasking environment is critical to the success 
of a desktop OS.  Linux, being mainly a server OS, is currently tuned to 
scheduling defaults that may be appropriate only for the server scenario.
To enable Linux to play an effective role on the desktop, a more flexible 
approach is necessary.  An approach that would allow the end-User the 
freedom to adjust the OS to the specific environment at hand.
So instead of forcing a one-size fits all approach on the end-User, would not 
exporting sched.c tunables to the procfs present a flexible approach to the 
scheduling dilemma?
All comments that have a vested interest in enabling Linux on the desktop are 
most welcome, even if they describe other/better/smarter approaches.
Thanks!
