Because NTP is a completely different beast.  NTP is used to keep a
software clock synchronized with a remote source.  This software clock
is usually implemented as a software PLL on top of a high-resolution
hardware clock, with the remote clock serving as frequency reference.
What I need to do, however, is calibrate a low-resolution hardware
clock using a trusted reference (which could very well be a software
clock maintained by NTP).
