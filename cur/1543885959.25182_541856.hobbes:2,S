New meaning in the last 3 years?

So can SLUB.

That SLUB cannot do. And I do not believe you. SLOB must have some way to 
distinguish the objects and their sizes since kfree does not include size 
information. You can mix slabs of different size on the same page without 
metadata. Magic?
So how does kfree then know how to free the object? There must be some way 
where you get the metainformation. What is the point of your 8 byte 
metadata that keeps getting inserted? That does not consume memory on a 
page?
