This depends on whatever SELinux rulesets you are running. Its just a
good rule to have present that most programs shouldn't be self patching,
and then label those that do differently.

mmap MAP_FIXED can do this but you need to know a lot about the memory
layout of the system so it gets a bit platform specific.

mprotect(, range) rather than a page at a time. The kernel will do
merging.

Use POSIX shared memory

Is it really that costly to create a blank file, why do you need to do it
a lot in a JIT ?

This is all mprotect and munmap.

mmap (although you get more VMAs from that) so memset() is probably
genuinely cheaper if the permissions are not changing.
