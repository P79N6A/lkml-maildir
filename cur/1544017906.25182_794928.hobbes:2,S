The PV kernel has over 100K larger text size, nearly 40K alone in mm/ and
kernel/. Definitely we don't see the worst of the icache or branch buffer 
overhead on this microbenchmark. (wow, that's a nasty amount of bloat :( )

I had a bit of a poke around the profiles, but nothing stood out. However
oprofile counted 50% more cycles in the kernel with PV than with non-PV.
I'll have to take a look at the user/system times, because 50% seems
ludicrous.... hopefully it's just oprofile noise.
