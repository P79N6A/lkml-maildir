Rest assured, ;) this is definitely a module. It includes a kernel patch that 
makes it possible to include a lot of the kernel headers into C++, stuff like 
changing asm :: to asm : : (note the space, :: is an operator in C++) and 
renaming "struct namespace" to something containing less C++ keywords. The 
module also includes rudimentary C++ runtime support code, so that the C++ 
code will run inside the kernel. I'm afraid that the task of compiling it for 
2.6 is going to be pretty tough -- the kernel needs loads of patches to make 
it work within a C++ extern "C" clause, and it probably completely different 
patches from those needed by 2.4. Getting the build system to work is the 
least of the concerns.
