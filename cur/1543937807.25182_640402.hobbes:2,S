Do "nm -n vmlinux" on the kernel to set an address sorted list of 
symbols, and then look to see what's near the eip (c037c0c7) and near 
the top of the stack (c0100add, c0378980, c0101962, ...).  Some of these 
may be in data, or other strange places, but the ones which correspond 
to code are interesting.
