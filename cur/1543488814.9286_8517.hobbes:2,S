Thanks for info.
I'm kind of confused though. I though it already was in one of the 
2.1.x kernels?

I did took there a brief look, and I see something like:
|        /dev/hda        /dev/ide/hd/c0b0t0u0
|        /dev/hdb        /dev/ide/hd/c0b0t1u0
But I still don't see how does it make sure that it does the "Right Thing" 
and that the /dev/hdaX won't get renamed to some other id when there
appears a new parition/slice.
I guess I could use those "full" names in order to ensure that it is 
unquie, but what about the old '/dev/hdX' names?
Thanks,
Adam
