Definitely.  Note that you can't just bootstrap a bzImage this way;
you still need a boot loader to go before the kernel.  As I've already
mentioned I intend for lbcon to support this booting mode (with full
access to the ISO 9660 filesystem), but lbcon isn't ready for prime
time just yet.
*Furthermore*, no-emulation does have a limit on the size of the image
(640K), which means it may not be suitable to simply attach a stub
loader to the image anyhow (after all, you might as well just make a
disk image if you're going to do that.)
Hard disk emulation is known to be broken on many BIOSes, and as such
isn't really an option.
