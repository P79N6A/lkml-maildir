How about not passing the buck off to "the vendor" and helping "this 
vendor" make sanitized headers.
Not everybody copies RH and changes the text files from "RH" to "my 
distribution name".
Gentoo is my very strongly preferred distribution and I have a lot of 
respect and admiration for Martin for stepping in this bull*shit pool 
and trying to get something accomplished.
