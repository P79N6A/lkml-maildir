I just tested module wistron_btn on  one Acer Aspire laptop after 
adding one dmi entry.  The wistron_btn found BIOS interfaces.
One visible error is the bluetooth light won't turn on upon 
stroking bluetooth button.
Without wistron_btn module, the bluetooth light works.
 with acpi enabled, I didn't try acpi disabled)
wistron_btn polls a cmos address to detect hotkey event.  It 
is not necessary, because there do have ACPI interrupt triggered upon 
hotkeys.  
So, my suggestion is to disable this module when ACPI enabled.
We need to implement hotkey support from ACPI subsystem for my
Acer aspire laptop.
