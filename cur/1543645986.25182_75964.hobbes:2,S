It used to be a spinlock, but too many drivers did bad things with the
spinlock held, so I changed it to a semaphore so they could sleep while
it is held.  I think in 2.5, all of the nasty drivers can be easily
fixed (the usb core now can be told not to sleep when submitting an
urb), so this might be able to be changed back to a spinlock.

I don't know, do we agree that you can't sleep in those functions?  If
so, I'll look into fixing the usbserial drivers up.
