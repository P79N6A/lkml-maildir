FWIW, I downloaded install 'floppyC28.fs' from openbsd web site.
In order to mount it under Linux I use following command:
		mount /dev/fd0 /mnt -t ufs -o ufstype=44bsd,ro
Under Linux 2.2.12-20 the floppy mounts fine and I can can see files
there and write new files.
Under Linux 2.4.0-test7-packet I can mount floppy, when I do ls in /mnt
it shows no files. Dmesg output shows following warnings:
UFS-fs error (device 02:00): ufs_readdir: bad entry in directory #2, size
512: reclen is too small for namlen - offset=0, inode=2, reclen=12,
namlen=260

[etc... ]
I have looked at MAINTAINERS, but it seems nobody maintains UFS.
