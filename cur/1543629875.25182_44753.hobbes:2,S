Hi,
kernel/swsusp.c in 2.4.19-pre8-ac1 includes:
<--  snip  -->
...
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE
        ide_disk_suspend();
#else
#error Are you sure your disk driver supports suspend?
#endif
...
<--  snip  -->
You hit the #error when you try to compile swsusp into a kernel with a
completely modular IDE.
