I ran into the same problem when using an FC-6 .config file compiling 2.6.19-rc4.  In my case, the problem was that the configuration options for Serial ATA have changed since 2.6.18 (which the FC-6 config is based on).  I had to manually go in to the config (with make menuconfig) and turn on the SATA device that I have.  What kind of SATA controller do you have, and what does your .config look like?
