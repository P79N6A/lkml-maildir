Jeff,
pardon my ignorance here, but it would seem you're asking for two different 
things:
  (1) a way to call a 'fsck'-type program, at filesystem-mount-time, and
  (2) a generic way for your device to pass 'action' messages back to 
user-space
(1) can already be handled in user-space.  initrd is its name.
you can keep a fsck-type program in user-land, yet have it called early in 
the boot sequence if required.
(by definition, if the kernel can load, then the initrd image has loaded 
too..).
(2) i'll leave open to the masses.  however, given (1) can probably give 
you a /dev too, i think its probably already resolved via /dev 
interaction.  yes, you'd still need an /etc/rc.d script to fix it up later 
on in the boot sequence, but that isn't exactly rocket science either.
cheers,
lincoln.
