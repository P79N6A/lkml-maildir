No, because freeze sets the active vt for us.  How about that: mount the
tmpfs before freeze, put there what we'll need, open device files from
there instead of /dev, and chroot() after atomic_snapshot?  Then, after
resume we won't be chrooted and we'll be able to unmount the tmpfs
safely.
Greetings,
