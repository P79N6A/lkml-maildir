I've submitted patches to David Mosberger against 2.4 and 2.5 BK current,
and the latest 2.4 ia64 port patch, which moves efi.h from include/asm-ia64
into include/linux.  This is important now that the GUID Partition Table
(GPT) code is included in the stock 2.4 and 2.5 kernels, and can be used on
non-IA64 platforms - specifically for handling really large disks.  There is
no ia64-specific code in efi.h.  David agrees that it's proper to make this
change.
I've asked David, as IA64 port maintainer who currently "owns" this file, to
forward these to Alan, Marcelo, DaveJ, and Linus respectively.
For the curious, the posts to linux-ia64 with patches and explanations:
For 2.5 BK-current:
