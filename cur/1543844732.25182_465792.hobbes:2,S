Subject: [PATCH]: Fix ALIGN() macro
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/23/11

A regression or two were added by the crypto-2.6 tree merge.
I've tracked down one of them, and it's caused by the ALIGN()
macro truncating things down to "int".  Some of Herbert's new
code is aligning pointers using ALIGN() and this thus explodes
on 64-bit since the top 32-bits get chopped off.
It is arguable that perhaps we should make a special macro
for pointer aligning, but even in that case ALIGN() as a general
purpose macro should use the largest natural integer size in
order to not cause surprises for people.
I'm still trying to track down the other regression added by
the crypto merge.  I have it git bisected down to a single
changeset, but I haven't determined what's really wrong yet.
I should be able to kill that over the weekend.  I want to fix
this before merging my networking tree so I can be absolutely
sure that IPSEC doesn't break because of something in my tree :)
[KERNEL]: Do not truncate to 'int' in ALIGN() macro.
