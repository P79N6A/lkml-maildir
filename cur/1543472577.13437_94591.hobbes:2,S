I just caught it on it's way to oblivion. I had netscape window-shaded and
looked into things when system performance went the way of the dodo while
starting up an rxvt. The swap thread was sucking 40% CPU and VM usage was
upwards of 8 MB when I killed netscape. 
This also sounds vaguely like what happened with tkmidi on a Cirrus card.
The close window caused the X server to go nuts, sucking enough CPU time
to throw off mouse updates and leave the system screwed.
