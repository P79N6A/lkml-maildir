hi suparna..
I applied ur patches in order to get BUFFER AIO Support on linux-2.6.12-rc6 kernel .
but they are not getting applied as some of the patches are with respect to 2.6.9 some are with respect to 2.6.12 kernel...
So can you please tell me how to apply those patches ....
I have applied ur patches after applying linux-2.6.12-PAIO-* patches provided by bullnet
Thanks
