Depends. For IDE, that is so. For SCSI, actually no io_request_lock is
not held while doing the bounce copy. The write bounce copy never
happens with io_request_lock held for either, the copy-back on reads
only does if the caller holds io_request_lock while entering
end_that_request_first() (or its own replacement, __scsi_end_request()
for instance).
The read copy-back is nasty for most users regardless of io_request_lock
status, because it happens with interrupts disabled.

That's good advise :-)
