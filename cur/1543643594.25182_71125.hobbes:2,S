Let me get this straight.  If you run this exact procedure, what happens?
1. start with DMA turned on
2. dd the whole disk to /dev/null
3. disable DMA
4. dd the whole disk to /dev/null
5. re-enable DMA
6. dd the whole disk to /dev/null
7. disable DMA
8. dd the whole disk to /dev/null
Are you saying that steps 2 and 6 produce a sectoridnotfound error, while
step 4 and 8 works without problem?
