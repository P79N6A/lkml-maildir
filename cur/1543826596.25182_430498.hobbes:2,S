The "every 8 sectors" corresponds to the Linux page size (32-bit) of 4KBytes,
which is the basic block I/O unit in real life.
The 0x1007000 is broken down as:
07 == "host byte"   = DID_ERROR = "internal error"
10 == "driver byte" = SUGGEST_RETRY
So it could just be some kind of internal soft error within the device driver.
The messages certainly lack end-user clarity, though.

Probably tomorrow.  I haven't ported it forward yet (from a much older kernel).
But I don't think it will help here now, as these errors
don't really look like bad media -- gotta look inside the usb-storage code to find out.
Cheers
