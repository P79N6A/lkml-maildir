Sorry, I missed the original message.
As far as the timer message from airo_cs when you try
to remove the card:  This executes some code that is
pretty much common to all PCMCIA drivers that sets a
timer to do the actual driver removal asynchronous to
the REMOVAL event.  You can find it in airo_cs.c. 
I'll update the driver.
I haven't tried the recent 2.5 kernels, so I check if
I see anything.
