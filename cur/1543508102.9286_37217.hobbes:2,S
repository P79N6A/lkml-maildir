Of course, the argument can be made (and has been many a time in many
different forums) that using global variables (especially unprotected
by mutexes or other such mechanisms) is a **bad thing** in MT programming.
In many many ways, global variables are a big bad accident waiting to happen.
Better to make A (from your example) local to the thread that uses it,
and the same with B. If the variable needs to be shared between threads,
then make it global, but serialize access to it. If it doesn't need to
be visible to both threads, don't make it visible to both threads.
IMHO, that's just good programming practice. Granted, your example is
valid as far as the expected effects are stated, but that doesn't mean
it's good code.
