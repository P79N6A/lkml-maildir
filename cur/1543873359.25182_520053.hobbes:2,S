Yes, but on 2.6.20 and earlier kernels, most of the time with
development versions of the 1394 drivers. I still haven't tried
2.6.21-rc, will hopefully get to it tonight.

It will most certainly behave the same, unless you use the new
alternative FireWire drivers which are a whole different game. I hate to
say it but they don't have suspend + resume support yet. Like the
vanilla Linux drivers before 2.6.20/21, they have to be unloaded before
suspend or at least reloaded after resume.
