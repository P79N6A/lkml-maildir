As shown in the code included in my first e-mail, each thread simply
open("/dev/urandom", O_RDONLY), use read(2) to read 16 bytes, and
then close the file descriptor.
Duplicates appear quickly on: single CPU with HT, dual CPU without HT,
and dual CPU with HT (all with smp kernels)
But not on a lower end single CPU without HT (2.6.8-1.521 non-smp).

Will do next time!
