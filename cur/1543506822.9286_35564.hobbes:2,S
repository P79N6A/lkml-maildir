Well, this might work as long as poor Mike doesn't need to communicate
with non-Linux NFS-clients. However, it is (virtually) impossible to use
Linux v2.2.x NFS with w/rsize > 2048 against other clients. There is a bug
in Sun's nfs-client, which causes corruption, that only Linux triggers.
This bug has been fixed by Sun, but to little avail; lots of other 'ix:es
license Sun's (old, buggy) code.
I would REALLY appreciate if someone could look into this and see if it
would be possible to fix this on the Linux end. I know too little of NFS
myself to look into it, but I know that a lot of people using Linux in
bigger solutions needs this problem solved. Sure, in an ideal world, all
other OS's would bugfix their clients instead, but in the real world, this
won't happen, and that inflicts pain to us.
