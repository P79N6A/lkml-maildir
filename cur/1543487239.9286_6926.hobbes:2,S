Hmmm...maybe I'm confusing myself.  The bttv driver actually shuts off
the audio when the device is closed.  I think one of the ES1370, GUS,
or GUS Max shuts down the card at module unload, but unfortunately they're
all in another building and they aren't cross-wired well enough to test.  
The GUS Max definitely goes silent on a soft reboot though.  I haven't
connected one to an analog input and tested module unloading in a number
of years and I can't remember what it does in that case.  It definitely
forgets and reloads default values for the mixer when the module _is_
loaded, however, because I had to work around that behavior in a server
application.

On cards with software mixers (i.e. Linux scales all audio before sending
it to the card, or uses the card's wavetable synth with a volume setting
to simulate a mixer control) there is no hardware to read back, and I'd
imagine that there exist sound cards with write-only mixer controls.
What happens on laptops with sound hardware and power saving mode?  Does
the sound chipset power down if the sound driver is unloaded?  Would that
be a good idea if it wasn't already happening?

In the interest of consistent semantics between different modules for
wildly different sound hardware, I would advocate that the card default
to silent unless explicitly told otherwise, and not be active (even for
analog pass-through) if the device driver is unloaded.  Of course I'd
like mixer controls calibrated in dB and better realtime synchronization
with the sound hardware too.  Maybe this is more of a topic for
the ALSA group.
