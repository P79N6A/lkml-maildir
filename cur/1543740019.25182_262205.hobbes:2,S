Yes, for long periods of idle, I'd like to see the periodic clock tick
disabled entirely.  Clock ticks causes the hardware to exit power-saving
idle states.
The current design with HZ=1000 gives us 1ms = 1000usec between clock
ticks.  But some platforms take nearly that long just to enter/exit low
power states; which means that on Linux the hardware pays a long idle
state exit latency (performance hit) but gets little or no power savings
from the time it resides in that idle state.
