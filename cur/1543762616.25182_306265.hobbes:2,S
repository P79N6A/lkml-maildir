nope
a call instruction is effectively half a cycle or less, the branch
predictor of the cpu can predict perfectly where the next instruction is
from. The extra if() you do in front is a different matter, that can
easily cost 100 cycles+. (And those are redundant cycles because kfree
will do the if again anyway). So what you propose is to spend 100+
cycles to save half a cycle. Not a good tradeoff ;)
