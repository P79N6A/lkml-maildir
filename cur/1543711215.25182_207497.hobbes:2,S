I mean that I thought that if ->flags & REQ_SPECIAL were set, then
we were obliged to flush the driver request queue before treating 
this request, and I also thought that the driver was liable to receive
such things from somewhere else.
What I now suppose from your words above is that 
  a) ->flags & REQ_SPECIAL is something I can set all on my own.
  b) if I do (or even if I don't?), the ->special field is mine to use?
     (I am surprised since I dimly recall spotting it used for
     something).

It gets even worse, since I was using the very highest bits of ->flag
for a sequence counter.  Very successfully, I may add.  Is there any
other place I can simply add to the request a counter for the number of
(write) requests having gone through the driver?  The idea is that the
driver is the only one who knows the real time order in which requests
are received, so it must be the one to stamp them, and if somebody else
wants to receive these and preserve order, this sequence number must be
observed. But I didn't see anywhere to put them.
Are you going to say, set REQ_SPECIAL on everything and add all the
real request info and a bit more to ->special? I suspect you are!

I don't quite understand. Using a different make_request_fn for these
"special" requests is useful and indeed I do use one. But an "io
stack"?

Well, everything was working fine apart from death after revalidation!
But I am attempting a rewrite now in accordance with what you say,
which is why I am happy for elaboration/confirmation of (a-b) above.
I presume I can't get "special" requests off of anywhere but the READ
and WRITE free lists via blk_get_request?  It would be easier to debug
if there were a separate list.
