Judging from these graphs, all of the latency issues are solved, at
least on my UP hardware, and the latencies seem to be getting very close
to the limits of what the hardware can do:
http://krustophenia.net/testresults.php?dataset=2.6.9-rc1-Q6#/var/www/2.6.9-rc1-Q6/jack-test-1
The worst case latency is only 160 usecs, and the vast majority fall
into the pattern from 0 to 120 usecs.  All of the spikes above 120 are
almost certainly caused by netdev_max_backlog.  However these are not
long enough to cause any problems with my workload; the lowest practical
latency for audio work is around 0.66 ms (32 frames at 48khz).
