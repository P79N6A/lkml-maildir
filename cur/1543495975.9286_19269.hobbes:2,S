You are bothering the wrong person.
It is not Linus's job to go out and seek updates to drivers, it is the
driver maintainers job to sync up his work to Linus.
For some reason Donald does not do this work, and others are expected
to do it for him.  I, as well as several others, disagree with this.
You can bother Linus all day long about it, and the best he can do is
to tell Donald to get his act in gear.
Later,
