The delay accounting value was added to the end of /proc/pid/stat back
in July without discussion, so I assumed this approach was still
considered satisfactory.
Putting just these four values into a new file would seem a little
odd, since they have a lot in common with the other getrusage values
that are already in /proc/pid/stat.  One possibility is to add
/proc/pid/rusage, mirroring the full struct rusage in text form, since
struct rusage is already part of the kernel ABI (though Linux doesn't
fill in half of the values).
Or perhaps it makes sense to reorganize all the values from
/proc/pid/stat and its siblings into a sysfs-like one-value-per-file
structure, though that might introduce atomicity and efficiency issues
(calculating some of the values involves iterating over the threads in
the process; with everything in one file, these loops are folded
together).
Any thoughts?
David
