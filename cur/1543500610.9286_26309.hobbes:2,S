Kernel 2.3.9-4

UP
ip_masq.c: In function `get_next_mport':
ip_masq.c:798: `masq_port_lock' undeclared (first use in this function)
ip_masq.c:798: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
ip_masq.c:798: for each function it appears in.)
make[3]: *** [ip_masq.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[1]: *** [_subdir_ipv4] Error 2
make: *** [_dir_net] Error 2
masq_port_lock is declared within an #ifdef __SMP__
I just defined it unconditionally.  I don't know if that is the *right*
solution but it seems to work for me. (Well, at least it compiles. 
Haven't actually tried using it yet.)
