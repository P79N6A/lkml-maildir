    You know, there's one other possibility, and that's if the data that is

    Given that the two processes are on the same machine, I would expect a
    send() on a TCP socket to deliver the data to its destination faster
    than that, however.
You can measure this latency; and it's indeed very low (lmbench gives
28 usecs on one of my machines).
If process A blocks waiting for data, and process B sleeps after
writing this data intended to wake process A, it should wake almost
immediately.
If you don't see this I would suspect an application bug -- can you
use strace or some such and confirm this is not the case?
