UTF-8 2 bytes end with U+07ff which covers only Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew and
Arabic.
All JCK Unified Ideographs  (U+4E00-) and Extensions (U+3400-) have 3 byte
encodings with UTF-8. Some of the B Extensions even use 4 bytes (U+20000-)

For ASCII you have one byte.

Umm, thats a bit missleading. UTF-8 works with bit not byte prefixes.
Unicode code points are integers and depending on the encoding represented
as multiple code points, which can be represented as bytes.

You might want to look up Joel's Tutorial or just browse the Unihan Database:
