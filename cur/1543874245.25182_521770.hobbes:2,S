You must have missed this part:
"As for what happens at panic time, if the kernel knows how to modeset 
we can do whatever we want:  conservatively clear an appropriate 
scanout buffer and render our panic there, switch into a better mode to 
dump the panic if we think that's possible, or just hang without any 
output like we do today."
Where "an appropriate" might mean "currently active" which would give us 
what you and Peter are saying.  The point is, with the modesetting code 
in the kernel, we'll actually *have* all the information you outlined 
in your previous mail so we'll have a chance to dtrt when the panic 
occurs (which is to tell the user about it).
So don't worry, I'm not ignoring that point at all, doing much of 
anything after panic/oops is a crapshoot. :)
