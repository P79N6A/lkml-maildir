Because the VM recycle algorithm it's not well tuned for high intensive
I/O application. Apply these two my fixes and the problem will disappear:
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/my-2.2.12/no-swapout-2.2.10-B
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/my-2.2.12/shrink_all_cache-2.2.10-A
If you are also going to swap heavily some time you may want to apply also
this one:
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/my-2.2.12/trashing-mem-2.2.10-A
If you have an SMP machine you may want to apply also this other my patch
that rewrote reschedule_idle improving the global performance of the
system.
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/my-2.2.12/SMP-scheduler-2.2.11-E
All the above patches are ready for production so really don't worry to
apply them on a production 2.2.12.
Any positive/negative feedback is always welcome ;).
Thanks.
Andrea
