I useold AIM7 plus a small patch which is just to change a couple of data type to match
64bit.

My machine has 8GB. To simulate your environment, I reserve 6GB for hugetlb, then reran the testing
and didn't see any failure except:
AIM Multiuser Benchmark - Suite VII Run Beginning
Tasks    jobs/min  jti  jobs/min/task      real       cpu

Above info doesn't mean errors.
Perhaps you could:
1) Apply the attched aim9 patch;
2) check if you have write right under /mnt/shm;
3) echo "/mnt/shm">aim7_path/config;
