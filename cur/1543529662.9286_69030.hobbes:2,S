I am having problems with this: using matroxfb, having created a mode
which fits my monitor best, I would like to boot with that mode, so that I
didn't have to set this mode for all VTs.
If I have:
append="video=matrox:xres:1056,yres:688,upper:20,lower:0,hslen:6,left:62,right:100,vslen:120,pixclock:9000"
in lilo.conf, it just ignores the rest of the line after something like ^
this point, this way using a lower pixclock, which means a refresh rate
not very neat.
So far I could not solve this problem. Any ideas?
