I had trouble with DMA and compact flash cards on our board (prior to
the new revision) since it did not have the DMA lines (they weren't part
of the CF spec when the board was designed).  The way I booted was to
pass 'ide=nodma' and that worked fine (at least on the sc1200).
I could enable dma with hdparm later if I wanted (which of course made
the ide driver rather upset when it tried to then use the non existant
dma lines).
