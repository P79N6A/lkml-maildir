The problem  likely isn't the true "zombie" - the only thing that *those*
processes have left is a process table entry to save the exit code for a wait()
syscall that might not happen anytime soon.  And unless you have hundreds
of them sitting around causing pressure on the 32K process limit, they're
probably not a big problem.
More likely, what you're looking at is some process that has gone down into the
kernel on some syscall or other and gotten blocked.  Since signals aren't
delivered until it returns, it ends up "unkillable".
Traditionally, a common cause for such wedging was a lost/misplaced interrupt
from an I/O operation, so a read()/write()/ioctl() call wouldn't return because
the device hadn't reported it completed. (tape drives were notorious for this).
Often, power-cycling the I/O device would cause an unsolicited interrupt to be
generated, which would clear the "waiting for interrupt" issue and allow the
process to return....
