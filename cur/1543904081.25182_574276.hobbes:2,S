In fact I don't have strong feelings on this part of the interface
design either.  I pointed out the limitation to Davide, and 
pointed out that the related eventfd interface read()s an 8-byte 
integer, and Davide then just fired off a patch to Andrew which 
went into --mm.
It's the other problems with the interface that bother me more
(inability to retrieve previous setting when changing
the timer; inability to retrieve time until next expiration
without changing the current setting).
Cheers,
Michael
