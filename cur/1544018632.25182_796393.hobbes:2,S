i'd not mind it at all if the kernel could be built with other open-source 
compilers too.
Now in this case the patch you suggest might end up hurting the end result 
so it's not an unconditional 'yes'. But ... how much it actually matters 
depends on the circumstances.
So could you please send a sample patch for some of most common inline 
assembly statements that are affected by this, so that we can see:
   1) how ugly the LLVM workarounds are
   2) how they affect the generated kernel image in practice
My gut feeling is that it's going to be acceptable with a bit of thinking 
(we might even do some wrappers to do this cleanly) - but i'd really like 
to see it before giving you that judgement.
Another question: does LLVM always warn about such input/output aliased 
constraint width mismatch problems if they occur, or does it silently 
corrupt the resulting instruction sequence?
