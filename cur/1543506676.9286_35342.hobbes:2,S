Hi,
I can't reproduce crashes here, runs and runs.
but..
For grabbing crash data, you can use a serial console on another box
or if you have a line-printer, you can use that as a console. IKD+KDB
can be very useful for grabbing snapshots of odd events too.  (I have
a freshly extracted 2.3.15-2 diff (~100k gzipped) sitting here in case
anyone needs one)
