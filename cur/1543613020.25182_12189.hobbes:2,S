Right, but instead of trying to balance cache available memory and swap
my swapper will only be concerned whether the page can be evicted and
whether it is from the address range I want.
The scheme is like:
  open -> request buffer allocation -> start region_swapper  ->
     -> wait for freed memory to accumulate and reserve as it appears -> 
     -> when enough is available stop swapper and declare allocation finished
