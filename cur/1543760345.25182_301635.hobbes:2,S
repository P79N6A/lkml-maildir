Actually there's restrictions to how many pages are getting converted
as converting pages over from cached to uncached isn't trivial on ia64.

Actually I posted that earlier, but it must have gotten lost in the
noise. It's part of the genalloc/mspec patchset. I'll send it to you
directly.

Coming your way in a jiffy.

I don't see any problems with that. The way it's meant to be used is
that once pages are converted over, they don't go back into the
allocator.
