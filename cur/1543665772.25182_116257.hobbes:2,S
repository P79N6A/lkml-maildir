Subject: [PATCH 2.2] drivers/net/net_init.c array bounds
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Alan,
As discussed, appended patch against 2.2.24 addresses a potential array
bounds overflow of *ethdev_index[MAX_ETH_CARDS] (and similar) in
drivers/net/net_init.c
It also cleans up the declaration of i in etherdev_get_index (hopefully
only doing what the optimiser does anyway ;-).
The bit I'm cautious about are lines like:
	break;	/* have found a non-initialised slot */
I can't see why they weren't originally included - but that doesn't mean
there's some subtle but good reason for their absence (and consequent
subtle breakage by including them).  OTOH, I've been running with this
patch for many months and haven't noticed any side-effects.  And yes,
this patch is definitely broken without these lines.
FWIW, this doesn't appear to be an issue in 2.4 as things are done
differently there.
One thing this patch does NOT do is to clean up the various printk()s
which do not have a KERN_* - most of these appear to be fairly dramatic
(e.g. "this shouldn't happen" (er, "this shouldnt happen"? ;-)) so
probably should be KERN_ERR.
Thanks,
Neale.
