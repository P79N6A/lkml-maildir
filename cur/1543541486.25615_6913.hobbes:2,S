Currently you lose your "normal" file attributes (ie. the
ownership info and permission bits) when you transfer a
file over http.
Why would this be any different with extended attributes?
When you _do_ want to have these things transferred, you can
use a modified tar (or cpio or pax) archive format. Just like
the "standard tar" stores the normal unix attributes, it should
store the extended attributes.
And when we're talking about a "multistream file", just give the
user the whole directory in one .tar file...

Rik
