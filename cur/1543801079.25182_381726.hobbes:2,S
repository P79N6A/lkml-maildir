Beyond what was said by Stephen Hemminger, the driver reports a
NETDEV_TX_BUSY when !STATUS_ASSOCIATED: neither this patch nor mine
fix it. 
Btw the patch that I posted earlier forgets to protect against 
every undue wake-up through:
ipw_rx
-> ipw_rx_notification
   -> priv->link_up (work_queue)
      -> ipw_bg_link_up
         -> ipw_link_up
It will need some extra care to correctly play the
netif_{stop/wake}_queue dance.
