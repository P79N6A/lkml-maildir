This would indeed be bad when using CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU!  Good catch!!!

This look like a valid fix to me, at least as long as the lock is never
dropped in the meantime (e.g., to do I/O).  If the lock -is- dropped in
the meantime, then presumably whatever is done to keep the page from
vanishing should allow an rcu_read_unlock() to be placed after each
spin_unlock(&...->lock) and an rcu_read_lock() to be placed before each
spin_lock(&...->lock).
						Thanx, Paul
