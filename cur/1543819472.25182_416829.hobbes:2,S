I am not sure, this will apply to Samsung chips or not. But in case of
TI OMAP we had separated the directories based on the "Generation" of
processors produced by TI, which is OMAP1 (OMAP1510, OMAP1610,
OMAP1710, OMAP730, OMAP5910, OMAP5912) and OMAP2 (OMAP2420, OMAP2430 -
(2430 support is not added to git tree yet)). So directory structure
now becomes like
arch/arm/mach-omap1
arch/arm/mach-omap2
include/asm-arm/arch-omap
arch/arm/plat-omap - This directory contains the things which are
common between OMAP1 and OMAP2 generation of processors and can be
#ifdefed with specific CONFIG_ARCH_OMAP1/2. e.g gpio, dma apis etc.
