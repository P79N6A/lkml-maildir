OK, I don't know how good this idea is, but I want to know what people
think of this - actually, now that I think about it, there are hardly
any uses at all for it. But I think it would be an interesting thing for
me to write. So here it is: Raw FS. Mount any fixed size device to a
location. The mount point will have the following directory tree, for a
device of length 0x22C blocks
0/
    0/
        0
        1
        2
        .

In other words a device can be mounted as it's internal structure. New
files cannot be created, and the existing ones, as they represent blocks
of data, cannot be extended. Might be useful for low-level debugging and
stuff, and neat (and risky) to play with. Anyway, the other thing I want
to know is, is there any HOWTO on writing a FS driver? Or should I just
try to work from an existing one?
