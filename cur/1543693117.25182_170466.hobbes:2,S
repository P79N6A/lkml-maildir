First off, linux-kernel is probably not the place to be asking this.
You should try this on the linux-hotplug-devel list and at least cc: the
author of udev.  Anyway...

Try mounting it at /sys instead, that's the "recommended" place for it,
but udev should still be able to figure out where it is.

The fact that the config files are hardcoded to be looked for at
/home/greg/src/udev/ and you probably do not have that path on your
system?  :)

Are they from udev?  What do they say?  Any errors?
Yes, I need to write a better install script and instructions, sorry.
