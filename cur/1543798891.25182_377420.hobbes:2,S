did I mention that this driver really needs a rewrite :(
It is full of ugly hacks around the URB structure. The use of the URBs
for the bulk and isoc endpoints is not really how it should look like.
It will consume USB bandwidth even if there are not active data or audio
connections from this device. I am still curious that it is still
working (except for suspend).
