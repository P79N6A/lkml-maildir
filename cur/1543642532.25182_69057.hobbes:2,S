Never mind, I can see that the main function of the page lock here is to 
allow the filesystem to know there's no IO in progress on a block and so the 
block can be recovered and used for something else.  Leaving the page in the 
page cache during IO is a simple means of keeping track of this.
All the same, I have deep misgivings about the logic of the vfs truncate path 
in general, and given all the trouble it's caused historically, there's good 
reason to.  I don't know, it may be perfect the way it is, but history would 
suggest otherwise.
