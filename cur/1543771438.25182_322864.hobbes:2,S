One of the calls I got the other day was for loopback interface. 
Default MTU is 16K, which seems to screw everything up and do higher 
order allocs. Turning it down to under 4K seemed to fix things. I'm 
fairly sure loopback doesn't really need phys contig memory, but it 
seems to use it at the moment ;-)

Sounds like we still need to cope then ... ?
