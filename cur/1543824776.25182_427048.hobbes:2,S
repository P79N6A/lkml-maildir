Oh it won't all be in userspace, but at the moment the setup component
is, so things like setting the memory pools up is, however the TG work
won't solve all the problems in the world, so we need to wait for the
big code drop and then decide what needs to be done.

Sorry I meant on top of those things, it was the modesetting I'm
suspect on, if we can "secure" modesetting I think we can leave it in
userspace.

Exactly, Jon's problem is he tried to force X and X developers to bend
to his world view, he never realised that you don't need the X
developers to bend to your view of the world, you just present your
world view as being better and then more importantly you fix all the X
code to work with your code as well and still work in the abscence of
your code.
