S3 suspend-to-RAM has the same requirement. When the system enters S3, 
the PCI slot loses all physical power and the card's registers are 
completely gone.
So I've already had to fix up the aic7xxx driver to, among other things, 
reset the DMA base addres on resume. This should help for swsusp. 
Although maybe there are other requirements for swsusp... I think for 
swsusp we have to cope with a resume request that seems to come out of 
nowhere.
