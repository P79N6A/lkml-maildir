It didn't boot at first until I fixed this ;)

the issue is that the address will be a link time thing, which means 
lots of complexity. and it's only a handful of functions, so pinning 
these few explicitly looked to me like the best simple solution (eg 
anything else will be fragile and failures in this area are near 
impossible to debug, even when it'll work now complexity means it may 
fail in the future ;( )
