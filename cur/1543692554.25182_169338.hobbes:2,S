Nvidia can fix this easily. Either by having several versions of
their closed-source thing, or by having a open "interface" that
uses nvidia's calling convention for talking to their proprietary
binary code, and whatever the kernel uses for talking to the kernel.
That's the price of binary modules -
One extra level of indirection, or a bunch of different modules.
Of course there are plenty of other cards without
such problems.
