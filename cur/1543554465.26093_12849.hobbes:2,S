The Rubini book is being updated for 2.2 and 2.4, but I dunno when it
will go to press.
The best reference is the source code.  When working with the Linux
kernel, you -quickly- learn to hone your code-reading skills, because
the code is the best documentation.
When you want to figure out how to do something, find a similar example
in the kernel source tree.  When you want to figure out the conditions
under which certain code is called, examine all callers.  And all
callers of callers.  Until you are satisfied you see the complete call
path.
Use the source Luke :)
