Ah, indeed, thanks!
Offtopic. I noticed this problem while looking at this patch:
	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm-commits&m=120141116911711
So this (the old vma could be removed before we create the new mapping)
means that the patch above has another problem: if we are remapping the
whole VM_EXECUTABLE vma, removed_exe_file_vma() can clear ->exe_file
while it shouldn't (Matt Helsley cc'ed).
Oleg.
