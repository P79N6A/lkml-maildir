Oh yes, sorry I forgot, module tty_ldisk3 cannot be found, so ppp dies with 
exit status 1...
I didn't think ppp needs anything other than ppp_generic, the serial driver 
for ppp and the compression modules...
What is tty_ldisk3? could you help me on this? 
Also, I haven't been able to solve the cpu problem...
and also, modprobe warns of unknown symbols in /etc/modules.devfs...although 
the 2.4 kernel works fine...
