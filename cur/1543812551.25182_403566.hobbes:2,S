Yah.

So the lock memory is as much as the hash table? ;-)

Even with the 256K entry hash table, __dlm_lookup_lockres is still the

Note, this is uniprocessor, single node on a local disk.  Something
pretty badly broken all right.  Tomorrow I will take a look at the hash
distribution and see what's up.
I guess there are about 250k symbols in the table before purging
finally kicks in, which happens 5th or 6th time I untar a kernel tree.
So, 20,000 names times 5-6 times the three locks per inode Mark
mentioned.  I'll actually measure that tomorrow instead of inferring
it.
I think this table is per-ocfs2-mount, and really really, a meg is
nothing if it makes CPU cycles  go away.  That's .05% of the memory
on this box, which is a small box where clusters are concerned.  But
there is also some gratuitous cpu suck still happening in there that
needs investigating.  I would not be surprised at all to learn that
full_name_hash is a terrible hash function.

Daniel
