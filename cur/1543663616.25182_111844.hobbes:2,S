IDE on big boxes?  Is that crack I smell burning?  A desktop with 4 GB
is a fun toy, but bigger than *I* need, even for development purposes.
But I don't think EMC, Clariion (low end EMC), Shark, etc. have any
IDE products for my 8-proc 16 GB machine...  And running pre-patches in
a production environment that might expose this would be a little
silly as well.
Probably a bad example to extrapolate large system numbers from.
