Thanks for testing. I appreciate this and I'm more than just plain willing
to help out. Any thing goes to get this patch solid. :)
I'll come up with a patch tomorrow to try and get a clean stack trace. I've
made some change to the bug dump output to make it more preemption aware,
but, as you can, some tweeking is needed.
However, I don't think this is going to be a simple atomic violation problem
that I've seen numerous times before. That's what the previous patch tried to
address. It's seriously pointing to a problem with the rtmutex and/or how it's
used, maybe a corner case it's missing.
I'll start to look at it either tonight or tomorrow and see what's going on.
It's going to take me a bit so be patient. I'll definitely get back to you
on this. I've got a number of weeks to blow exclusively on -rt development,
so I'll be around for a little while longer, hopefully longer.
