	The major error in your reasoning is assuming that chips in the future will
use as much power as chips do today. This is just like all the people who 10
years ago said that the '486 was so powerful it would never be on the
desktop -- forever relegated to high-power servers.
	I think it's almost obvious that in about 20 years, Linux on 32-bit
machines will be as interesting as Linux on 16-bit machines is now. By 2038,
Linux on 32-bit machines will be as popular as Linux on 8-bit machines is
now.
	OS development always faces tradeoffs between supporting leading-edge
technology properly and maintaining compatability with low-end hardware.
Yes, a balance has to be struck, but ultimately, you have to move on.
