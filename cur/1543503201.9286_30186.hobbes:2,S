Hi,
Problem:
The de4x5 NIC driver deadlocks the system if the driver handles two (or
more ?) NICs. Loading the driver MODULE goes fine. Bringing eth0 up is no
problem, it works fine. Bringing eth1 up afterwards deadlocks the system. It 
also happens if eth1 is brought up first (then eth0 locks the system). It
doesn't matter if they share an interrupt or have seperate interrupts.
The deadlock leaves no special messages. The correct type of the
connection (100Mbit Full duplex) is detected, but the effect is 
0 Mbit/year (i.e. keyboard dead, ALT-SYSREQ fails, /dev/ttyS0 dead: system
dead)
It might be important: The cards are DLink 21140-based cards, and the
tulip driver (that I should not use regarding the docs) works fine.
