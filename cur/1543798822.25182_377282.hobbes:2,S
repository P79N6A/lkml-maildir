If you need a quad only copy then put it into asm/string.h (asm/io.h if
its operating on I/O space I guess) or somewhere similar as a generic
function that does just that. That allows people to come along and
provide the same functions for other platforms if they need it, and also
makes it possible for others to use this feature if their hardware has
the same feature.
Nobody expects you as a vendor to support it on sparc64, x86-32 or
whatever, nor to write sparc64 asm functions just to make it possible
for someone to do so cleanly later on.
