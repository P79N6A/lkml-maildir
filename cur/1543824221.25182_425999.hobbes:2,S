"acpi=off" is a superset of "noapic" here, presumably because the
board doesn't have MPS  tables that describe the IOAPIC when ACPI is
off.
"noapic" is a perfectly reasonable thing to use if you don't
have a lot of interrupt sources and there is no more sharing
in PIC mode than IOAPIC mode.
The advantage of using IOAPIC mode is that the system has more interrupt
pins
availalble and this allows sharing to be avoided.  It also allows
the system to target the interrupts to any processor when you
have more than one.
