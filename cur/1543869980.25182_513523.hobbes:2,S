The original proposal of this thread uses a RCU (read-copy-update) style
update of the previous 64 bits counter : it swaps a pointer (atomically)
upon update by incrementing a word-sized counter that is used, by the
reader, to get the offest in the array (with a modulo operation) for the
current readable data and as a way to detect incorrect reads of
overwritten information (we re-read the word-sized counter after having
read the data structure to make sure is has not been incremented. If we
detect an increment, we redo the whole operation).

When I say "clocksource read issue", I am talking about
race between the function you proposed earlier, which you say is used in
-rt kernels for latency tracing (get_monotonic_cycles), and HPET and TSC
"last cycles" updates.
