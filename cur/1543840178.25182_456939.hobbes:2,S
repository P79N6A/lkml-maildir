They do appear to be -p0
	They aren't adding the same thing twice to the same file. This patch
makes different arches source the same Kconfig.
	I seem to recall Chandra suggested that instead of doing it this way it
would be more appropriate to add the source line to init/Kconfig because
it's more central and arch-independent. I tend to agree.
