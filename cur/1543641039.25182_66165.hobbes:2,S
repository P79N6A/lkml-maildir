I'm not allowed to report second hand rumors from the folks who assisted with 
the debug of the x440 HAL, so I won't mention that they may or may not be 
using clustered logical interrupts and adjusting priority with the TPR.
I can admit that I have no clue how they assign IRQs to APIC clusters, whether 
randomly or if they try some load balancing scheme.
