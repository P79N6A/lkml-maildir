Subject: [PATCH] handle usb host allocation failures
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It looks like a host (like ohci or whatever) could try to allocate a new 
usb_device structure with usb_alloc_dev and get back a valid pointer even if 
the allocation of its private data failed.  I first saw this in the 2.4 
sources, but it looks like 2.6 has the same problem.  This patch attempts to 
fix it by freeing dev if the ->allocate() routine fails, and then returns 
NULL instead of a potentially dangerous dev pointer.
