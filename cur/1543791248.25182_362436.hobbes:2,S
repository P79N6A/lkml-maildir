No, I think it's been happening, it's just that said developers are  
still fixing the copious bugs in the various kernel concepts of  
"time".  IIRC John Stultz' rework is approaching completion, and when  
that goes in it makes life a lot easier for the various dyntick and  
variable tick projects.
