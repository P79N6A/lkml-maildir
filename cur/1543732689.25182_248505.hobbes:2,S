Makes sense, netdev_max_backlog never made a difference on my system
(via-rhine driver).
If you read that Microsoft paper I posted a link to earlier, they
describe all of the main categories of latencies we have dealt with. 
They give special mention to network driver DPCs/softirqs.
The worst offender was a driver that used a DPC/softirq to reset the
card if there was no traffic in 10 seconds, to work around a hardware
lockup bug in some versions.  Since the reset path was never designed to
be fast this caused problems.  They also mention a similar problem to
the one that still exists with the via-rhine driver (fixed in -mm) where
it uses a DPC to poll for link status.
