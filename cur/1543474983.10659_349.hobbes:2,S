I presume decreasing HZ might be good for improving the throughput on
computational jobs, compilation etc. and would kill interactivity, so
what if the scheduler monitors the type of processes running (whether
they exhaust their timeslices, for eg.) and decides on a nice value of
HZ every 10 seconds or so (maybe choose between the permissible values),
with HZ #defined to get_HZ().. wondering how intimately the rest of the
code depends on HZ being a constant, and whether the constant-HZ
dependent parts can't be kicked into reading the new value.. hmm?
