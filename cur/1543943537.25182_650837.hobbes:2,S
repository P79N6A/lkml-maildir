your first patch was outright wrong then you declared the second one a 
"cleanup" while it changes behavior: bad in my book ;-)

now that i pointed out the difference, your position changed to "changes 
behavior in minor ways" ;-)
This is fragile code and almost nothing in the MTRR area is "minor", we 
are just not touching this code unless it's really justified.
