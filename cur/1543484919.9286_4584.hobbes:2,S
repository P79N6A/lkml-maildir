Christoph , I was scanning the Linux 2.2.1 source tree with a Lint script
and found the following bug. If you aren't the maintainer or owner of this
component, just let me know.
Keep up the good work!

pcxe_init() does not check whether kmalloc() returned NULL. ch->tmp_buf may
be used in pcxe_write() without checking for NULL either.
./drivers/char/pcxx.c (1565): no immediate kmalloc check 27:
 =kmalloc(ch->txbufsize,GFP_KERNEL) [ch->tmp_buf]
