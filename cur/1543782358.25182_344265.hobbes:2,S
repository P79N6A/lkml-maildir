Subject: [PATCH 4/5] Add address translation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/24/187

Add a helper function to convert an arbitrary mapped virtual address to a
physical frame number.  Adapted from code by Chris Wright, added support
for large pages.
Because of the placement, this needs to be a macro; pgd_offset_k requires
init_mm to be defined, and getting the include files right seemed more
complicated than a macroized implementation.
A more proper location would be in asm/page.h, but that gets confounded
by the use of pgd_offset_k() again.
