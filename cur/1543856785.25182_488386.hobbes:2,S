I haven't measured speed.  Size wise, making them char shrinks vmlinux
text size by 112 bytes on x86_64 (using default config option).

It was suggested to declare another struct that embeds pagevec to perform
iteration.  But I prefer to have pagevec having the capability, it is
more compact this way.
It would be nice if you can review blockdev-specific dio code.  I would
appreciate it very much.
