This patch has conflict with sata_sis driver. They both register this
id 0x0180. But pci ide driver is loaded first. So if you have sata
drive connected as root, dang, you'll get kernel panic. I had this
problem with 2.6.14_rc4-mm1. Simply delete the third line from
structure sis5513_pci_tbl resolved it.
I know it's just a work around.
Can somebody tell me how to track file history under mm- tree?
