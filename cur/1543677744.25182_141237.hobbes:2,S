By the time we're done, there will be /sys/class/drivertype for every
driver in the system!
Seriously, do you think /sys/class/usb-storage is really appropriate?  It 
would be like creating /sys/class/ide-devices.  Wouldn't something under 
/sys/class/usb/ be better, say /sys/class/usb/mass-storage/ ?
Or would it be still better simply to create something like 
/sys/devices/pci0/0000:00:07.2/usb1/1-1/1-1:0/storage/ ?  A little 
confusing perhaps, because it would refer to the same physical device as 
its parent, but not inappropriate.
