For BP we have
/* On resume clear all MCE state. Don't want to see leftovers from the BIOS.
   Only one CPU is active at this time, the others get readded later using
   CPU hotplug. */
static int mce_resume(struct sys_device *dev)
{
        mce_init(NULL);
        return 0;
}
For APs mcheck_init() is called on resume. But as the respective bit
for an AP is usually set in "mce_cpus" after boot (which is correct, I
think) mcheck_init does not call mce_init, see:
void __cpuinit mcheck_init(struct cpuinfo_x86 *c)
{
        static cpumask_t mce_cpus = CPU_MASK_NONE;
        mce_cpu_quirks(c);
        if (mce_dont_init ||
            cpu_test_and_set(smp_processor_id(), mce_cpus) ||
            !mce_available(c))
  =>             return;
        mce_init(NULL);
        mce_cpu_features(c);
}
But we need to call mce_init to clear all MCE state.
IMHO the best location to call mce_init for APs is the cpu notifier.
