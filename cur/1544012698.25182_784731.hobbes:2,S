Yes, this patch is simple and straightforward, but now we can't change
->f_flags in non-preempible context. And the global lock is not very
nice anyway.
Once again, can't we use O_LOCK_FLAGS bit? I agree, it is a bit ugly,
and I won't insist if you don't like is.
	static inline int try_lock_f_flags(struct file *file)
	{
		return !test_and_set_bit(O_LOCK_FLAGS, file->f_flags);
	}
	static inline set_f_flags(struct file *file, unsigned int flags)
	{
		file->f_flags = flags & ~O_LOCK_FLAGS;
	}
Now, nobody should change ->f_flags directly (except create/open
pathes. For example, ioctl_fionbio() should be changed:
		if (try_lock_f_flags(filp)) {
			if (on)
				set_f_flags(filp, filp->f_flags | flag);
			else
				set_f_flags(filp, filp->f_flags & ~flag);
		}
If try_lock_f_flags() fails we do nothing, as if the current owner of
O_LOCK_FLAGS changes ->f_flags after us.
What do you think?

do we really need lock_file_flags() here?

Ditto. Nobody can see this file yet, we can change ->f_flags lockless.
But please correct me if I am wrong, I know nothing about fs/.
