Hi Ken'ichi,
This approach seems to have advantages also. For example, now one will not
require a kernel debuginfo file to configure kdump with dump filtering.
I think having to have a debug info file is a big restriction.
Now vmcore ELF note contain all the data rquired to filter core dump and
there will be no need to parse DWARF debuginfo and makedumpfile code will be
smaller and simpler.
Given the fact that more and more architectures are supporting multiple
page sizes. Now one can also export relevant kernel CONFIG variables
through this ELF note. makedumpfile's job will be simpler. You don't have
to make any guesses about various config options like page size.
This approach will make second kernel truly independent of first kernel.
Currently, if first kernel changes one shall have to regenerate the 
initrd for second kenrel. Hence in a sense, second kernel is dependent on
first kernel. Now kernel will export all the required data for dump filtering
so one does not have to rebuild the seond kernel initrd even if first kernel
changes.
I think overall the approach of exporting right info from kernel should 
help. Only thing is that we shall have to manage the ELF note better in
terms of making it more generic.
Thanks
Vivek
