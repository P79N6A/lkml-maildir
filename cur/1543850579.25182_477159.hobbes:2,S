This overflow list (you may call it differently, but still it IS a list), is 
not complete. I feel you add it just to make me happy, but I am not (yet :) )
For example, you make no test at kevent_finish_user_complete() time.
Obviously, you can have a dangling pointer, and crash your box in certain 
conditions.
static void kevent_finish_user_complete(struct kevent *k, int deq)
{
	struct kevent_user *u = k->user;
	unsigned long flags;
	if (deq)
		kevent_dequeue(k);
	spin_lock_irqsave(&u->ready_lock, flags);
	if (k->flags & KEVENT_READY) {
+               if (u->overflow_event == k) {
+		/* MUST do something to change u->overflow_kevent */
+		}
		list_del(&k->ready_entry);
		k->flags &= ~KEVENT_READY;
		u->ready_num--;
	}
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&u->ready_lock, flags);
	kevent_user_put(u);
	call_rcu(&k->rcu_head, kevent_free_rcu);
}
