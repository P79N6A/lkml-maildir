<br>Ok. I got the machine back together and I've got it using the Quantum
drive - not as a primary, but to get things off. Here's what I found:
<p>* copying >10MB files caused it to crash.
<br>* I got the source to 'cp' and added a call to sync() after every read/write
pair in copy.c. I was able to copy huge files without crashing - slowly,
what with all the syncs, but stably. Perhaps there's something to the "buffer-list
destroyed" messages&nbsp;i was seeing.
<br>* gpart may well be the coolest utility on the planet.
<p>I'm not a kernel hacker, but perhaps something has changed about how
file buffers are stacked up before a sync? the last thing it would print
before locking up would always be "in swapper task- not syncing".
<p>This is no longer a critical problem for me, since I don't rely on these
drives anymore, but it's still a problem to others. I got mail from a guy
re: my post yesterday saying he had the same problem, but he identified
his errors as coming after an upgrade from 2.2.10 to 2.2.13. These are
all quantum scsi drives - has scsi.c changed?
<p>the quantum drive's .config and /var/log/messages can be found at <A HREF="

- thanks for any and all help :)

<blockquote TYPE=CITE>I've got a problem I'm having a hard time debugging,
but here's what I have
<br>so far (these are two bugs, one should be easy to find&amp;fix)
<p>1) I have an AIC-7895. When I set the kernel up to compile in the aic7xxx
<br>driver, it loads it in the kernel but then it also loads the module
-
<br>redetecting the two channels, for a total of four hosts, causing an
<br>interrupt conflict, and panicking. No biggie, I just load aic7xxx by
module
<br>only, but you might want to fix it at leisure.
<p>2) *THIS IS THE KILLER PROBLEM*
<p>I have a Quantum Viking II 8.7gb drive. I was running RH5.2 (lk 2.0.36)
on
<br>it for ~8 months with no problems. Yesterday I tried to upgrade to
RH6.0 (lk
<br>2.2.5-15) and immediately began having errors.
<p>The condition was any bulk read or write, ie. copying a 150MB file around
or
<br>tarring up a big tree or running a tape backup. The message was something
<br>like
<p>&nbsp;Kernel panic: scsi_free: attempting to free unused memory
<p>I don't recall exactly. There were other errors - some bus timeouts
- but
<br>most were the above. The machine would not boot after that - when it
detects
<br>the filesystems, it would e2fsck since they weren't cleanly unmounted;
the
<br>act of e2fsck would cause the error again. I ran out and bought a WD
IDE
<br>drive; I got RH60 installed, but the partition table on the quantum
drive is
<br>so hosed that fdisk prints an empty table (but, surprisingly, properly
<br>detects the CHS of the drive.) If anyone has a utility that will allow
me to
<br>at least detect the ext2 partitions I can get my .config and
<br>/var/log/messages to help debugging.
<p>I used to have Quantum Atlas SCSI hot-swappables in a Dell Poweredge
2300
<br>running 2.2.5-15, and it crashed all the time too; our RAID card vendor
said
<br>something about Quantum's termination being non-standard, but I don't
know
<br>if that was tech support BS or for real. After having the viking blow
up
<br>with 2.2.5, I think it was for real.
<p>We replaced the hot-swappables with IBM drives and the condition went
away.
<p>In any event, it worked with 2.0.36 scsi; it fails with 2.2.5 scsi.
On
<br>different hardware, different motherboards, the drive manufacturer
is the
<br>only obvious similarity except that both machines are SMP, one is a
dual
<br>P2/400 the poweredge is a dual P2/450. In both cases removing the quantum
<br>drive stopped the problem.
<p>If anyone knows how to get my logs/configs off the quantum drive, i'd
be
<br>super-willing to do that - I need all the freaking files back off it
too!
<br>(my tape backup gave me ~75% of the machine back)
<p>any, all, and as much help as I could get would be a source of eternal
<br>gratitude.
