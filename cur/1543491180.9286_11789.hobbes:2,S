The obvious fix is to roll a bunch of these tiny programs into one and
differentiate using argv[0]. Fewer pages in core, fewer blocks on disk,
and better script performance. The natural extension of this idea is to
link all of /bin into one monolithic demand-loaded executable. Woohoo.
Tomsrtbt is most of the way there.
But we should all be ashamed for extending such a tangent on the list
anyway..
