Hi,
I have a Vibra16XS (yes, I know it sucks, but I can't afford better right
now), and, after about 15 minutes of mpg123 playing, it will suddenly go to
complete static. This can only be fixed by something closing the channel,
and then reopening it. I've also tried with large waves, only to get the
same result.
This is using 2.4.4-ac6, with only Netfilter hacks.
