Hm, I don't see how we can avoid holding locks for the whole pagetable
at once.  We need to hold the locks from between marking a particular
pte page RO until the whole pagetable is pinned; if we don't, pte
updates can come in from other cpus, which will fault on the RO but
won't be fixed up by Xen.
Could we avoid it by doing a series of partial pins, locking and
unlocking each one in the process, and then pin the whole pagetable?
