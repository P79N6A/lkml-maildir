I'm planning on releasing an updated version today, with the changes 
Eric pointed out were necessary (mainly not running it on non-Intel 
CPUs, since AMD maps high memory differently).  But it's good to see 
that the forward porting part of it will be easy. :)
I'm shooting for inclusion post 2.6.22, since I think the change is a 
bit too intrusive (mucking with early boot code) to push it before 
that.
Thanks,
Jesse
