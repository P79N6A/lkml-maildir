Seconded.  Exactly the same reasons I've refused to merge patches
into cpufreq to allow arbitrary tables to override BIOS tables.
Or patches to remove boundary checks.   Even when correctly
implemented, this stuff can be fragile as hell, so introducing
more things that cast doubt over its stability isn't something
I'm keen on at all.
