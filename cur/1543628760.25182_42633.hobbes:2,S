I'd go even further and suggest that pulling the mapping from a mask or
key to string out into a table and looping through it is preferable for
this sort of thing. You win later if you decide you need the same mapping
elsewhere or if you want to format your messages differently, add bits to
it, etc. Tables are generally easier to inspect for errors than code,
although Linus' version is very nearly a table.
Maintaining tables as code is a pain and is generally only a win for
small or sparse state machines.
