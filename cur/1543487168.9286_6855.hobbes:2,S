check out a program called Bootpart (
http://www.winimage.com/bootpart.htm
)
as this dos program will do the same thing as dding your bootsector from
your linux partition .. basically you follow instruction already mentioned
(set your lilo.conf so that boot= points at your linux root partition, then
run lil) then you boot into NT/98/whatever and run bootpart .. the /? switch
tells you just about everything you need to know and the program adds linux
to your NT boot loader for you .. very useful :)
