   There is a problem here: include/linux/modversions.h needs to be
   rebuilt before compiling *.c in the subsidiary makes.
I was assuminig that if the programmer made any changes which might
impact modverions, that they would be smart enough to know that they
needed to do a "make depend" first, which would generate a new
modversions.h. 
Your idea of a two-pass scheme is nice, but it means that whenever you
do a "make vmlinuz", you have to do one quick recursion down the tree to
check to see if modversions.h needs to be updated, and then another
recursion to actually do the compile.  
The design question is whether it's worth it to force programmers to
wait through the extra recursion, or simply ask programmers to re-run
"make depend" manually.
