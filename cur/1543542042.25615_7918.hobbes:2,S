I think you're mistaken about this.  Or, to be more precise, I think
your remarkable native talent as an implementor has given you some
unhelpful design biases that are only going to be cured by more
experience.  
I'm fairly sure that experience will prove survivable for the Linux
kernel and the rest of us -- but when you say things like the above, I
start worrying a bit...
