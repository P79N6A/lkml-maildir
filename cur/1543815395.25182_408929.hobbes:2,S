it's not that hard even. All you need to do is make the vm be lazy about
it; if it encounters a pinned page during scanning, move it THEN to the
pinned list. If it then gets pinned more no issue. The first unpin then
moves it back to the normal list (yes it's still pinned), but the first
time the VM sees it it goes right back to the pinned list.
That way there's no need to keep a "pin depth" at all...
