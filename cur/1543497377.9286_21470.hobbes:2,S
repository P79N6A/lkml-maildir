Is your server capable of supporting the NLM locking protocol? The
userspace nfs servers (Olaf Kirch's nfs-server) don't --as opposed to
knfsd and most non-linux servers. NFS partitions from these kind of
servers should be mounted using the 'nolock' mount option, and will
only support local locks (i.e. they are not shared over the network).
Cheers,
