I dont see a good reason for sending an signal to an application in response
to an syscall (expecially of the error code is well defined). Which
application would want to use a signal? It is so much work to guess which
syscall failed, so there is no reason for it. And  there is no reason to
kill an application if it receives -EPERM. The application most likely want
to write the error message.
