Please cc me on replies as I am not subscribed to the list.
I am running a standard debian 2.4.19-k7 kernel on a configuration that has an 
ide dvd rom drive and a scsi cd writer.
Sometime during boot sequence (I can't find where in any log or dmesg - but 
looking at the text flying by - soon after the scsi adapter is found and the 
bus is being scanned for scsi devices) the module ide-scsi gets loaded.
The problem is, I don't want it loaded because it prevents mplayer playing my 
dvds
I initially assumed it was something in the debian start up that caused it but
a) asking on the debian-user mailing list has not elicited any useful reponse
b) grep -r ide-scsi /etc throws up nothing (ie there is not reference to 
ide-scsi in modules or modules.conf or any initialisation sequence doing a 
modprobe ide-scsi)
c) scanning all through the initrd.img (loaded through the loop device) does 
not show any reference to ide-scsi either (although grep finds the sequence 
in bin/mount and then hangs locking my keyboard)
d) modules.dep only shows ide-scsi needing other modules (ide-mod, scsi-mod) 
not the other way round.
I am stuck, where can I look next?
[and I know I could just do a rmmod at the end of the start up sequence but 
...]
