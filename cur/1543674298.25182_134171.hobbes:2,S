Thank you.  Nobody seems to be able to type correctly today :-).  I had
actually found it, and looked it over.  It looks pretty nice, although
the lack of documentation is somewhat annoying.
However, if the ethX=.... exists, I would far prefer to use that.  (The
parameters for what  am doing have to be at bootup to work, it can't be
after the fact.  I hunted for a while, and I still couldn't find it,
btw.)  Otherwise, it's really up to the driver maintainers.  I will
adjust as they want, I will use the module_param stuff or the old
__setup stuff.  I would like to get this in, though.
