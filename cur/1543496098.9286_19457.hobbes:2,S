Sure it is. You don't think of it as one because it is normally given
to every user, but it is a privilege. Opening a network connection is
a privilege. Debugging your own process is a privilege.
It would be very good to take away the right to exec() privileged
executables, so that a cracker with a shell could not attack buggy
privileged executables in the normal manner.

This is what Linux 2.2 already does, except that all users get a full
set of inheritable bits.
