As far as I can tell, it has nothing to do with disk geometry.
Someone just cut couple of sectors at the end from disk, you compiled
your kernel without CONFIG_IDEDISK_STROKE, but still kernel for some
reason reports block size as if idedisk_set_max_address() was invoked.
I do not see how this could happen with 2.4.21-rc3... Can you recheck
that you are using 2.4.21-rc3 without any additional patches?
