I'm trying to draw the distinction between kernel-internal Xen-related
headers, and the Xen hypervisor ABI itself.  The stuff under
xen/interface is more or less copied in from the main Xen tree, so it
would be nice to keep it distinct.

The balloon driver isn't in this patch set, so I'll drop all references
to it.

Structurally it's just a u32.  I could wrap it up in a structure for
typedef reasons, I suppose.

Not sure what the deliberations were leading to those changes.

I know this ordering was the result of a relatively recent bugfix
replacing something that was completely broken.
