Don't we need a consistent indexing system for patches?
May be the subsystem maintainers can upload patches to some place over ssh/ssl
and the maintainer can _download_ them from there. The maintainer will simply
email the patch number and not the whole thing. And patches can be
numbered/named in some consistent manner.  Once the system is in place, we can
even automate md5 checksums etc.
Cheers,
Anuradha
