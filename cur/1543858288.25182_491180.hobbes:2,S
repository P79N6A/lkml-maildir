This doesn't make sense to me.  You do not want to cache the parity 
data.  It only needs to be used to validate the data blocks when the 
stripe is read, and after that, you only want to cache the data, and 
throw out the parity.  Caching the parity as well will pollute the cache 
and thus, should lower performance due to more important data being 
thrown out.
