So is your approach to this problem that because the security issue
isn't specifically in the kernel, we shouldn't discuss it here?
Dispite the fact that there are perfectly good ways of not only
working around the issue, but preventing it from even exising, that
could be implemented in the kernel?
Filenames _are_ arbitrary strings of bytes, I.E. binary data, and that
is how they should be.  I totally agree with that, (except that
obviously \0 and / have to be treated specially).
However, I don't see why it is any more logical to make the suggestion
that filenames generally be treated as UTF-8, IFF they are text at
all, than it is to suggest that filename should be arbitrary strings
of 32-bit words.
Why not:
* State that filenames are strings of 32-bit words.  UCS-4 should be
  the prefered format for storing text in them, but storing legacy
  encodings in the low 8 bits is acceptable, (but a Bad Thing for new
  installations).
* Let legacy applications store 8-bit values in those 32-bit words if
  they want to, but strongly recommend only 7-bit ASCII values are
  stored, not values 128-255.
* Create a divide - filesystems that support strings of 32-bit words
  in their on-disk format, and those that don't.  Those that don't can
  simulate 32-bit words for the new functions that require them, by
  padding with \0 high bytes.
* Hide all filenames with any values > 255 in them from legacy
  applications, by not returning data about them in existing legacy
  kernel functions.
* Introduce new routines to deal with 32-bit filenames, which Unicode
  applications can use when they need to store non-ASCII, (I.E. non
  7-bit).
* Note that UTF-8 stored in the low bytes is still acceptable, (but
  depreciated in favour of UCS-4).
* Note that this preserves the philosophies of:
  * No policy in the kernel
  * Filenames are arbitrary bytestreams, (but now optionally 32-bit
    ones, not just 8-bit ones!)
* Note that this is very different to my last suggestion, which was
  fundamentally broken in many ways.
