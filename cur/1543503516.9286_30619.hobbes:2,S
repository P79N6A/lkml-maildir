Hello,
I swiched my NIC from a 3c905B-combo to 3c905C-TXM and noticed
the normal 3c59x driver doesn't support this card(Init_module:Device or
resource busy). I got Donald B.'s 3c59x.c:v0.99L version, wich works fine
here.
That's why my vote :)
I tested this with pre7-2.3.11.
Thanks,
Arjan Filius

Argh!  All right, so how am I supposed to work with Linux when
everything's already been done?!  Can't these people leave some
broken MSDOS like parts so there's problems left to solve!?....
