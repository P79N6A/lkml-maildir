I guess I don't really see what was so bad about switching to the "none"
tracer, as the resize operation is expected wipe everything anyway.
Likely because for mmiotrace, toggling tracing_enabled is the same as
switching tracers.

I'm very much looking forward to this.

The "nop" having no buffers at boot would be enough, but this would be
even better.

Does this also increment the lost events counters?

Why not call tracing_on, say, logging_enabled?
IMHO tracing_enabled vs. tracing_on is incomprehesible, but
tracing_enabled vs. logging_enabled is a little more understandable.
current_tracer is self-explanatory, and tracing_enabled used to be.
Thanks.
