What exactly are you guys still talking about? Alan is looking at drivers 
and finds that in them outb_p is generally correct and correctly specified 
in bus-clocks for at least some (8390 was quoted). In those legacy drivers, 
the _p ops can simply stay and can use the 15-year old proven 0x80 outb.
(with molnar suggesting they be renamed isa_in/outb_p and me suggesting that 
if someone would be doing _that_ they might as well split them manually in 
outb(); slow_down_io() possibly renaming slow_down_io() to isa_io_delay() or 
similar).
Is this only about the ones then left for things like legacy PIC and PIT? 
Does anyone care about just sticking in a udelay(2) (or 1) there as a 
replacement and call it a day?
Rene.
