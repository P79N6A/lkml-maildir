Some people have written scripts to run in initrd for this the last
time. Using sfdisk -ld and shell scripts is very simple though not a
solution for everything, just for now.

The plan for Linux 2.7 is to rip out partition detection from the kernel
and do everything in userspace (probably initramfs). So someone could
start by making the partition detection code a library.
The detection script/program could then be run from udev (the hotplug
interface) when a new block device is created.
I don't know what can be done about the ioctl that tells the kernel to
reread the partition table. It could either be dropped or make the
kernel create a hotplug event but that seems rather ugly.

I think you're on the right way. But you see there are still a lot of
issues to be discussed.
