I know modern AMD processors have it.  I don't know about any others, nor
off hand where to look to find out.  Is there a better way to compose the
"depends on" condition so that it will be true on the modern common
processors and future common flavors, but false on the various ones we
don't know about?  (I really just looked around a little and figured that
!X86_F00F_BUG about corresponded to "P6 family".)
Thanks,
Roland
