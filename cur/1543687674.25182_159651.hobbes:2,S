Have some tests completed. 
Results are ..interesting.
All results:
 
http://developer.osdl.org/cliffw/reaim/index.html
On a gross level, the delta has indeed shrunk:
STP 4-CPU
STP id PLM# KernelName        Workfile  MaxJPM  MaxUser Host     Change
277851 2063 2.6.0-test3-mm3   new_dbase 5327.15  88     stp4-000  0.00
277455 2049 linux-2.6.0-test3 new_dbase 5324.95  92     stp4-000 -0.04
However, if we look at the detail within the runs, the two kernels do run
differently. It's not really good/bad, just different.
 
Basically, -mm3 runs a little slower, but steadier.
-test3 has bigger peaks and valleys, the average between the two over the run comes 
out about the same. Example:
Num children  JPM/-mm3    JPM/-test3
44            5079.77     5183.81
48            5130.43     4853.96
52            5102.86     5161.39
Numbers taken from:
-test3 ->

-mm3 ->

Sorry to be so vague..more tests are underway.
Code location:
bk://developer.osdl.org/osdl-aim-7
tarball:

Run parameters:
./reaim -s$CPU_COUNT -x -t -i$CPU_COUNT -f workfile.new_dbase -r3 -b -l./stp.config
./reaim -s$CPU_COUNT -q -t -i$CPU_COUNT -f workfile.new_dbase -r3 -b -l./stp.config
(3 runs each, average of all 6 reported)
