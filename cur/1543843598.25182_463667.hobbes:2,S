If you don't want to listen to my part of the argument then consider
the point of view of those who have maintained systems entirely based
on binary editing, namely systemtap and LKET. It's indicative that
all those who have been involved in tracing, be it by static
instrumentation of code or the use of binary editing, all favor some
form of static markup mechanism of the code.
