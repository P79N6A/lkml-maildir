Subject: [GIT PULL] FireWire updates post 2.6.24
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, please pull from the for-linus branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ieee1394/linux1394-2.6.git for-linus
to receive the following IEEE 1394/ FireWire subsystem updates.  Once
again it is almost all about bug fixes.  Most notable are David Moore's
fixes for isochronous reception which greatly enhance the new firewire
stack's usability in the IIDC domain (uncompressed video from industrial
cameras and webcams).  The storage driver firewire-sbp2 received some
attention too, prompted by user reports, but that's an ongoing story.
I let self-discipline slide this time and added 9 patches which have not
yet been in -mm and were not listed in the "What's in linux1394-2.6.git?"
report from January 17.  Half of those are bug fixes from November which
have been laying around waiting for last touch-up until we noticed in
January that they indeed address a good number of bug reports.  The other
new additions are bug fixes too.  Everything has been intensively tested
with affected and unaffected hardware.
Updated status of the new (still EXPERIMENTAL) drivers/firewire
subsystem:
  - integration with userspace libraries still with rough edges,
  - DV reception broken on OHCI 1.0 variants of VIA VT630x,
  - IP over 1394 still not implemented/ ported,
  - SBP-2 (storage) fragile during hotplugging on some setups.
Before distributors of kernel packages consider to enable the new
firewire drivers in parallel or instead of the classic ieee1394 drivers,
we ask that they first read up about all the caveats of the new drivers
at wiki.linux1394.org which we regularly update.
I will re-post the newly added patches in a reply.  Stat and shortlog of
the entire queue:
