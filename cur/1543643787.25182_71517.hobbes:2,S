Well, this was done in part to minimize change.  The version which
returns no value is far more common than the one which does, and would
require changing a lot more files (and would also make getting this into
2.4 harder too, which I would like to do someday if this gets into 2.5). 
The other reason is that CONVERT_foo makes it quite obvious what is being
done, where as __xxx at least in my mind has namespace imlpications
(like how it's used in libc, etc.  But kernel namespace isn't like the
rest I know..).
