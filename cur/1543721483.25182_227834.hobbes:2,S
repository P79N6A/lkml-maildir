Well, I can report that it looks just fine from here.  I'm running 2.6.7
with the staircase patch, and UT2004 - as well as everything else -
works great.  Machine is an Athlon XP 2600+ with nVidia FX 5600.  I
haven't tweaked any nice values or /proc settings.
FWIW, the whole 2.6.7 experience seems great.  All of the mysterious
troubles I had with 2.6.6 (eg failing to call init) seem to have
vanished, and everything is running beautifully again.  For me, at
least, 2.6.6 was a very ungreased turkey, but now I'm happy again!
Cheers
Alastair
