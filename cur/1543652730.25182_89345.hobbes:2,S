Don't disable the ide channel, set the hard drive type to none in the
bios, instead of auto.  I have 5 or 6 machines that are like that, 120 gig
drives in machines with 32 gig limits, and a few with 8 gig limits
If you are running 2.2.2x, make sure you put Andre's IDE patches in, as it
properly enables the controller to work at full speed, with DMA.
