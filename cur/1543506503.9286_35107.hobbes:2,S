Hi there,
Most dynamic kernel modules  have to  have an interface with user level
programs.
Right  now OS  Linux has only three  kind of  such interfaces:  device drivers,
system calls
and  pseudo files in /proc FS.  If you want to add your own module to Linux
kernel
you should  write your own special  pseudo-driver  or even use your own entry in
system_call_table[] i.e. you borrow some extra resource from system.
I propose an idea of new special system call for sending direct requests to
dynamic modules from
user level programs. Every dynamic module would have a special entry point (
like init_module &
cleanup_module) named syscall_module();
int syscall_module( char *module_name,  int request,  void *data, int size);
MODULE_NAME    - Name of the kernel module ( in user space area ).
REQUEST        -  A request number.
DATA      -  Address of  parameters ( in user space area )
SIZE           - Size of parameters
The user system call would  have the same prototype ( and name -  call_module ).
Every time user task make  that system call it redirect to module
SYSCALL_MODULE()  routine or
returns -ENOSYS if such module has not that entry point.
