I used to religiously test out ac kernels (in the 2.2, 2.3.x and early
2.4.x days).  I don't anymore, so the comparison may not be valid here. 
Anyway, I will try to either test 2.5.x on my router or else find a box
I can play with that doesnt' have so much important data on it.  (I hate
to say it, but I haven't been able to afford, $$ wise, backup for a few
years... I know... I can't afford not to either).
