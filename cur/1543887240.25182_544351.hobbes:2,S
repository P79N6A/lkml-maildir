Hello,
I'm not sure if it's correct place to deal with the issue.
In Documentation/devices.txt there is no info about adutux driver that
is included in the kernel:
...
		 65 = /dev/usb/usblcd	USBLCD Interface (info@usblcd.de)
		 66 = /dev/usb/cpad0	Synaptics cPad (mouse/LCD)
		 96 = /dev/usb/hiddev0	1st USB HID device
		    ...
...
The driver itself includes the following (drivers/usb/misc/adutux.c):
#ifdef CONFIG_USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS
#define ADU_MINOR_BASE	0
#else
#define ADU_MINOR_BASE	67
#endif
We need to update Documentation/devices.txt with this information. The
number of devices is 16.
I found an old mail tread for this:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0609.3/2173.html
But I don't see anything related to adu devices in devices.txt at all.
Please let me know what is the reason of this. If needed I will create
a patch for this.
