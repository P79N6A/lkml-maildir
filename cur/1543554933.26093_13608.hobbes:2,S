Richard,  before I read any further, I suggest that you get some
documentation on a few PCI VGA cards and read up on the register
addresses.  You may want to change your assumptions about what can and
can't be. ;)
And I can definitely say that if you don't allow access to these "extended"
VGA ports, BIOSes either enter infinite loops or else terminate without
initialising the card.  Trust me; I've been successfully running various
PCI VGA card BIOSes under an x86 emulator on an ARM machine for the past
few months.
