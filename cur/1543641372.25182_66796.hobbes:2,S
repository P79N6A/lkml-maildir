My frustration comes from the fact that my CPU time is being stolen from me
because of bad mechanical and software design.  I'm not even notified of
it.  If there were some way for the OS to over-ride or even be notified of
these events I'd have less of a problem with it.  As it is now, poor
system design is affecting OS design more and more.
} Systems designers are designing on the basis of thermal slowdowns being
} the optimal way to build some systems. Its actually quite reasonable for
} many workloads.

} Cpufreq doesn't handle this case yet in the 2.4 code but it already
} includes the needed udelay correction. Not everything CPUfreq has to
