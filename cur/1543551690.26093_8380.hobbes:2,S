ok just a few things i need to clarify:
	1) before upgrading to 2.4.0-testX, the machine was not howing as much
	memory used, after performing the same function.
	2) there is 0 memory shared, again under 2.2.17 a great majority of any
	used memory was shared.
	3) this machine has done *nothing*. It is idle. I booted it a day or so
	ago, logged in, since then memory has progressively dropped for no apparent
	reason.
It has been my experience that under 2.4 results from top/free etc are slightly 
'worse lookiung' than under 2.2.x but aren't really all that bad. eg: under
2.2.x on my workstation w/128MB of ram, 124MB used would give sluggish
performance under enlightenment, whereas the same case under 2.4 is fine, but
my boss isnt convinced. If the general consensus is that this is fine, ill take
it as gospel ;).
