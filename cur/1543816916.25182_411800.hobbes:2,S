I have no exact numbers in the hands as I'm in another country right now.
But! We tested Xen not long ago with iozone test suite and it gave 
~20-30% disk I/O overhead. Recently we were testing CPU scheduler and 
EDF scheduler gave me 33% overhead on some very simple loads with almost 
busy loops inside VMs. It also was not providing any good fairness on 
2CPU SMP system to my suprise. You can object to me, but better simply 
retest it if interested yourself. There were other tests as well, which 
reported very different overheads on Xen 3. I suppose Xen guys do such 
measurements themself, no?
And I'm sure, they are constantly improving it, they are doing a good 
work on it.
Thanks,
Kirill
