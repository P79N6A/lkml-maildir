Hello again,
I have downloaded DP83815 datasheet and I see that
> eth0: Wake-up event 0x200000a
means "broadcast received" and wakup on broadcast and 
unicast enabled.
> eth0: Wake-up event 0x80000a
Above means "unicast received" and wakup on broadcast 
and unicast enabled.
I will try to check if disabling wakeup makes any difference.
Rafał
