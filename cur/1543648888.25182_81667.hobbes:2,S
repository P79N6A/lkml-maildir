I think that on the host side the evidence is that "usbnet" is that
driver, and Pavel's patch is big step forward.  It forces all the
remaining questions onto the slave/target side (PDA for now).
Now, on the device side ... that's not really my call, but I agree
that'd be a good way to go.  The question is what's "best"?
Last I looked, no www.usb.org class spec or IETF RFC (even I-D)
standardized a reasonably simple/robust "IP-over-USB", so there
are only vendor-specific solutions.  Some of them deal with odd
hardware quirks, others deal with MSFT interop.  Lots of vendor
expectations have unfortunately been set on the MSFT side, where
creating product interop problems is sometimes seen as a win in
terms of market control or "product differentiation".
