I agree that "->exit_state = -1" makes sense, but I disagree in that I 
don't think it *matters*.
Most of the problematic kernel threads are long-running (as in "never 
exit"). Things like eventd, khelper, migration-threads etc will have init 
as their parent and never actually exit, so their ->exit_state doesn't 
matter. What matters is that they are on the children list, so when you 
have 1024 CPU's, and init has many thousand of these per-cpu threads as 
its children, then the *user* threads (that do exit) will cause problems!
I'd almost prefer to just not add kernel threads to any parent process 
list *at*all*.
