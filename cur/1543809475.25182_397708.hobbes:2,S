Hey Roman,
	I just wanted to make sure you know I'm not ignoring your suggestions.
I do appreciate the time you have spent, and I have been continuing to
work on implementing your idea. Unfortunately the code is not trivial
and very much hurts the readability. I expect thats a sacrifice that
will be necessary, but hopefully after some review cycles we'll be able
to come to something we both like.
I'm hoping to have a first pass patch I can mail this week.
thanks
