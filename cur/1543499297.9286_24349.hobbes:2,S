[1.] One line summary of the problem:
System loses all network connectivity 
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
I have several machines running kernel 2.2.10 (compiled without SMP
support) that lose network connectivity (they do not lose network at
the same time) after having been up for anywhere from 5 hours to 5 days.
The machines are still up when they lose network connectivity and there
are no errors in dmesg.  Running ifconfig shows the number of dropped TX
packets increasing--it looks like it's dropping all the transmitted
packets.
Running "ifconfig eth0 down" and then "ifconfig eth0 up" restores network
connectivity, but does not keep this from happening again.
As far as I can tell it is not a problem with the network card or a
problem with the switch port. I was originally using a 21143 Tulip card
(Kingston KNE100TX) with v 0.91 of the Tulip driver--I replaced this with
an Intel Etherexpress pro with the standard eepro100 driver that came with
2.2.9.
After discovering that this didn't solve the problem, I switched the 21143
Tulip card back into the machine, and upgraded the kernel to 2.2.10. I
thought this fixed the problem until the machine lost network
connectivity again.
I made the following changes to the kernel:
include/linux/limits.h
Change OPEN_MAX to 1024 from 256
include/linux/tasks.h
Changed NR_TASKS to 2048 from 512
I've also increased /proc/sys/fs/file-max to 8192.
