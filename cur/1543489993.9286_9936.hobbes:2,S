Hello,
I run iozone between two plain 2.2.3 boxes (server and client) :
/willy/u1/tmp > ~/iozone/iozone-2.2.1-ac3 200 8192 zz
        IOZONE: Performance Test of Sequential File I/O  --  V2.01 (10/21/94)
                By Bill Norcott
        Operating System: POSIX 1003.1-1990
        Send comments to:       b_norcott@xway.com
        IOZONE writes a 200 Megabyte sequential file consisting of
        25600 records which are each 8192 bytes in length.
        It then reads the file.  It prints the bytes-per-second
        rate at which the computer can read and write files.
Writing the 200 Megabyte file, 'zz'...63.280000 seconds
Reading the file...242.180000 seconds
IOZONE performance measurements:
        3314083 bytes/second for writing the file
        865947 bytes/second for reading the file
/willy/u1/tmp > 
The machines are hooked with a 100 Mb/s ethernet card.
The automount options specify : rsize=8192,wsize=8192.
With 2.2.1-ac7, I had around 3,5 Mb/s during reading. 860 Kb/s is
really bad.
Is that related to the 4k page size discussed in the list ?
A+
