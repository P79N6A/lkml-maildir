Hmmm ...

00:0b.0 Communication controller: PLX Technology, Inc. 9060SD (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Unknown device 125c:0640
/proc/pci 
  Bus  0, device  11, function  0:

I had to add ..
S 125c  Aurora Technologies, Inc.
        0640  Aries 16000P
to pci.ids to get it listed ...
00:0b.0 Communication controller: PLX Technology, Inc. 9060SD (rev 02)
