Thanks, this was it. I should've tried this first. Bart, the driver comes up 
just fine with acpi disabled in the most recent kernels.
ACPI is clearly broken on nForce 2, though, and booting my system with 
acpi=off, although allowing me to get to init, breaks USB initialisation. 
This breakage must have been introduced since 2.6.2-rc1-mm1.
