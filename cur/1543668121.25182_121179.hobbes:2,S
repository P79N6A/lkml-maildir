No generic kernel code _uses_ ->cpus_runnable on UP.
arch/s390{,x}/kernel/traps.c appears to use task_has_cpu() on UP,
but that's their bug and not an argument for slowing down UP kernels.
Hence, kernel/sched.c not calling task_release_cpu() to reset
->cpus_runnable to ~0 is not a bug.
The only bug (apart from s390's trap.c) is that task_set_cpu() performs
an unnecessary assignment to ->cpus_runnable on UP.
