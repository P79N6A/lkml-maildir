Sorry for my bad English but I'm an Italian 17 years old boy !!!
I look for the patch "Uniform Ide Driver" for kernel 2.2.x but
the web page of the maintaner 
http://www.dyer.vanderbilt.edu/server/udma/
is unrechable.
Where can I find it ???
I hav the 6.19 version for kernel 2.2.5 of this patch.
I patched the kernel 2.2.10 whith this but there was some errors
but I hav also compiled. 
Now I hav problem whitch scasi emulation whith cdrecord.
If it isn't a known bug I post most info.
Bye
   Daniele Nicolodi
