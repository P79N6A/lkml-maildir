For me, compiling a kernel or such was deadly. Not always, and the buffer
cache seemed to cover up for this until next reboot. Ate half of /etc once,
and kernel sources regularly.
I have:
                                Intel PIIX4 Ultra 33 Chipset.
--------------- Primary Channel ---------------- Secondary Channel -------------                 enabled                          enabled
--------------- drive0 --------- drive1 -------- drive0 ---------- drive1 ------
DMA enabled:    no               no              no                yes
UDMA enabled:   yes              no              no                no 
UDMA enabled:   2                X               X                 X
UDMA
DMA
PIO
(Master, drive0 is the disk (WDC WD135AA); slave, drive1 is ATAPI CD
(CRD-8400C)) [Yes, I know, but I'm not supposed to open the case (warranty)]
