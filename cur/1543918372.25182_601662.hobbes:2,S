It's not minor for any subsystem that has a non-trivial attach() operation.

What was wrong with my suggestion from a couple of emails back? Adding
the following in cpuset_attach():
struct cgroup_iter it;
struct task_struct *p;
while ((p = cgroup_iter_next(cs->css.cgroup, &it))) {
       set_cpus_allowed(p, cs->cpus_allowed);
}
cgroup_iter_end(cs->css.cgroup, &it);
