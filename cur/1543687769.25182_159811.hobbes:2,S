This is your message recast in the context of the kernel, or at least 
this is what it sounded like to me:
    *Sigh*.  The kernel oops *again*.  How dare you give me this kernel
    for free and then break it.  Fix it, right now, and I'd like an
    apology along with the fix.  Hurry up.
Maybe you didn't intend it to sound like that and you'd like to rephrase it.
