This is certainly the case. When I was packaging OSS for Xandros, our 
initial default was 50 percent. We eventualyl made it about 30, because 
even that was too loud on a laptop we were testing. There was little 
coherance between the various soundcards.
Waking the neighbors is the smallest problem. Blowing a speaker or 
makign the user deaf if quite another.
Yes, it's a distro problem. My Gentoo was build "-alsa" and so the 
alsa-sound init script does not 'go'. A simple rebuild will solve the 
problem.
