Not true, if this check does not pass, tp->ucopy.task is
never set, therefore prequeue processing is never performed.
This test must pass the first time, when both tp->ucopy.task
and user_recv are both NULL, in order for prequeue processing
to occur at all.
So his change did totally disable prequeue.
