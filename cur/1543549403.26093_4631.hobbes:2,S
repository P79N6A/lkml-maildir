Okay, in pre5 I got the scsi system to link
core-hosts-upperlayers.
We need to get the drivers outside drivers/scsi to link
as the _last_ ones in the host section:
core-hosts/i2o-upper.
Now this is difficult without moving things around, which is
bad. I'm not a makefile guru, so if you have any ideas go
for it. Alan problaly wants to verify the i2o stuff...
The perfect solution would be to remove the link order
dependency.
