There are two levels of hardware thermal control that will
kick in -- TM1 and TM2, and if they fail the hardware will
turn itself off.  Speaking for Intel processors only.
The reason is that the hardware needs to handle this case
where the OS crashes while in ACPI mode and is unable
to do any thermal control itself.
