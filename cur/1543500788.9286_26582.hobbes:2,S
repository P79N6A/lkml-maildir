May not have existed, then, which *would* explain it. :-)

Yes, that's the most difficult part.
The NetBSD manpage doesn't say what happens if you "mount -o
update,force,rdonly" when there are writeable descriptors open onto the
filesystem, and then try to use those fds.  I would assume further
attempts to write would produce errors (EROFS?), unless of course the
filesystem has been re-remounted read/write.
The manpage for umount says
     -f      The filesystem is forcibly unmounted.  Active special devices
             continue to work, but all other files return errors if further
             accesses are attempted.
I haven't looked at the relevant kernel code to see what *really*
happens.

*What* large table-walking?  All this means you have to do is have
every write check the relevant mount point to see if it's mounted
read-only, for downgrading remounts, and mark the filesystem as gone,
for forced unmounts.  (I suspect this is what deadfs is for.)

I know this.  I even think most of the people involved know it.
But there seem to be a few - not many, but very poisonous - who seem to
take any competition - indeed, almost any *difference* - as an
opportunity for "we're better than you" egoboo.
