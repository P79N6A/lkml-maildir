Thanks for your time. I get a kernel panic with the controller mode in BIOS
set to AHCI with Fedora Core 6. Once returned to IDE (setting used since
computer was built) I booted up. Added information: In Fedora 7 I can not
burn DVDs or CDROM using K3b with the Zip drive connected. Some
preformatting (I assume) is done rendering the CD/DVD useless then got an
I/O error. In Fedora 8 I am able to burn a CDROM using K3b but DVDs behave
as with Fedora 7. All is well when the Zip is totaly removed. This Zip
drive also worked under Microsoft 2000 { which was removed over a year
ago ;-) }. Fedora Core 6, Fedora 7, and Fedora 8 are all installed on
this machine. This drive did not work with a Ubuntu 7.10 Live CD on this
machine. I intend to try this Zip drive on another motherboard with the
above live CD.
