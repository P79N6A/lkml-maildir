Hi,
I noticed a problem in kernel 2.6.0-test10 which seems to be still there in
2.6.0-test11.. My ACPI battery status does not work! I compiled it into the
kernel (not as module) but /proc/acpi/battery/ is empty. Everything works
fine with kernel 2.4.22.
I get the following boot message (sorry for long lines):
ACPI: AC Adapter [ACAD] (on-line)
    ACPI-0352: *** Error: Looking up [Z000] in namespace, AE_NOT_FOUND search_node c11fc800 start_node c11fc800 return_node 00000000
    ACPI-1120: *** Error: Method execution failed [\_SB_.PCI0.LPC0.BAT1._BIF] (Node c11fc800), AE_NOT_FOUND
ACPI: Power Button (FF) [PWRF]
ACPI: Sleep Button (CM) [SLPB]
ACPI: Lid Switch [LID]
ACPI: Processor [CPU0] (supports C1 C2, 8 throttling states)
ACPI: Thermal Zone [THRM] (49 C)
The other ACPI stuff (Temperatures, LID Status, etc.) works, only battery
status doesn't. Would be nice if anybody could tell me if it's my fault or a
a kernel problem. Thanks in advance.
