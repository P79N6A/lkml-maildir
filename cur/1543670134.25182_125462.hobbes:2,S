You're right that 32 bits would be enough to hold the CRC. However, we do 
not yet know the checksum at compile time, so the trick I came up with is 
to use the linker to fill in the crcs afterwards, using assignment to 
absolute values. So while the crcs appear to be numbers to the C code, 
they are handled like addresses from the linker side, and things would 
most likely go badly wrong if the sizes aren't equal, though I have to 
admit I didn't try.
