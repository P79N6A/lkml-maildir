It is my understanding that the registered memory requirement has 
nothing to do with SMP but instead with the amount of memory you have. 
The more memory chips you have, the greater the signal loading on the 
memory bus.  More input drivers means more capacitance which means you 
need your output drivers to put out data sooner (relative to the clock 
edge, so registered delays by one clock) and stronger (greater drive 
strength).
In an SMP system (besides NUMA), multiple processors will talk to the 
same memory through a shared memory controller (like in a Northbridge), 
so although there are multiple processors, there is still only one 
memory bus.  Pulling off one CPU isn't going to change that situation.
