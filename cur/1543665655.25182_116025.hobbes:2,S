Hm, I thought I advised not doing this at all :)
Anyway, if we were to add this, you might want to:

Add a prototype of this variable to security.h so that everyone can

Why not initialize this when the security core is initialized?  Why
have a new initcall?
And when do you unregister this subsystem?
