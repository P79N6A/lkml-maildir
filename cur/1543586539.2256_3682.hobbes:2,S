Hey,
I just upgraded to kernel 2.4.3 on a k6 (233 mhz) with the processor 
type set accordingly, all the proper drivers compiled in and I get 
this big disgusting error message (my friend said that means i f***ed 
up) Sorry I don't have it, but I'll try to get it, because i'd have 
to write it down... I can't telnet-and-copy/paste for obvious reasons.
If I boot to kernel 2.4.2, it won't do that, so I know that lynx 
isn't the problem (and ftp has it too).
Pi
PS:
The SysRq key is a little funky in all kernels since 2.4.0... it 
doesn't accept help with the letter H, i have to hit the spacebar, 
and the log levels only change with the number pad...
