Just an idea - wouldn't it be useful to have dedicated errata pages
for recent stable kernels where important patches (such as the 2.4.18
personality fix, 2.4.18 samba oops fix or the upcoming 2.4.19 ide
updates) would be published? Finding a link to these in the kernel FAQ,
people would just patch their kernels instead of posting to lkml, which
could cut on the amount of duplicate bugreports significantly plus folks
wouldn't have to wait 6 months+ for an official update to get rid of an
oops.
