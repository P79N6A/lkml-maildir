Thank you Richard.  Many people, including very intelligent and literate
people have difficulty spelling.  There's a whole branch of psychology
to study the phenomenon.  We just observed that some people are
sensitive to bad spelling too.
Marcin's words seem insulting but may be a simple misunderstanding.
Rasterman's words could be interpreted as "i try hard to spell badly"
(because I think it's k3wl), or "i try hard to spell properly and it
takes me a lot of effort".
If anyone feels insulted by this message, don't be.  I wanted to raise
awareness of these simple misunderstandings, that is all.
