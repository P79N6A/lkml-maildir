Hi Ulrich,
I can comment on the issue of __SMP__ versus CONFIG_SMP.
The plan in my head is to fully support __SMP__ in 2.3 and 2.4, and
remove it in 2.5.  There are a lot of kernel trees in the world, plus
independent third-party modules.
In 2.3.XX I plan to submit patches to s/__SMP__/CONFIG_SMP/.  Most of
these are in arch-specific code, so it will probably be easier to
ask the arch maintainers to do it on their schedule rather than throw
patches around.
Anybody who wants to start changing code they are maintaining from __SMP__
to CONFIG_SMP, please feel free to do that any time (preferably after
the 2.3. fork).
Packages such as PCMCIA can do this if they want:
    #if defined(CONFIG_SMP) || defined (__SMP__)
There is no hurry on that change, but a year or two from now, I would
like to remove __SMP__ from the kernel build procedure, and it will
be nice if external packages are prepared in advance.
These are just my thoughts.  They are not anyone else's official plan.
