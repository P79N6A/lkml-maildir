I have to generally agree that the objections to the swap prefetch
patches have been conjecture and in general wasting time and
frustrating people.
There is a point at which it might be wise to just step back and let
the river run it's course and see what happens.  Initially, it's good
to play games of "what if", but after several months it's not a
productive thing and slows down progress for no good reason.
If a better mechanism gets implemented, great!  We'll can easily
replace the swap prefetch stuff at such time.  But until then swap
prefetch is what we have and it's sat long enough in -mm with no major
problems to merge it.
