md is 100% guaranteed perfect or your money back...
rsync is 100% guaranteed perfect or your money back...
your backups are 100% guaranteed perfect or your money back...
your hard drives are 100% guaranteed perfect or your money back...
your CPU and RAM are 100% guaranteed perfect or your money back...
your CPU and PSU fans are 100% guaranteed perfect or your money back...
