It's much more efficient to do
% bk undo -a`bk repogca`
(which deletes everything in the local repo that's not in the parent)
rather than pulling the entire repo over the wire again. [1]
You can check what would be deleted by this command with "bk changes -L"
similar to how you can "bk changes -R" to figure out what would be
pulled.
[1] Well, actually, it isn't *quite* that simple; in certain cases,
    repogca will delete more than it needs to.  But it's still more
    efficient than a re-pull.
