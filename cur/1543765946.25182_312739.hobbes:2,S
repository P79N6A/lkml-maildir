Done, pushed out. Can you verify that the end result looks sane to you? I 
just cheched that the diffstat looks similar (mine claims just 108 lines 
changed in aoecmd.c - possibly due to different diff formats).
And yes, my new merge thing seems to have kept the index-cache much better 
up-to-date, allowing an optimized checkout-cache -f -a to work and only 
get the new files.
Pasky? Can you check my latest git stuff, notably read-tree.c and the 
changes to git-pull-script?
