Well my problem first of all is that you did not read the full message. It 
discusses that later and provides page pools to address the issue.
Secondly you keep FUDding people with lots of theoretical concerns 
assuming Mel's approaches must fail. If there is an issue (I guess there 
must be right?) then please give us a concrete case of a failure that we 
can work against.

Allocations can currently fail and all code has the requirement to handle 
failure cases in one form or another.
Currently we can only handle up to order 3 allocs it seems. 2M pages (and 
in particular pagesizes > MAX_ORDER) will have to be handled by a separate 
large page pool facility discussed in the earlier message.
