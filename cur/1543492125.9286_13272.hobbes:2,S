Everyone says this, and I know it works (had to figure it out myself
some months ago) but I'd like to know: bzip2 is a better compression;
if it's just the better compression ratio then people could be bitten
by this again in a while, with no fallback. If, on the other hand, the
bzImage is a fundamentally different storage layout without this
(undocumented?) size limit, why make a zImage at all these days?
Details wanted!
