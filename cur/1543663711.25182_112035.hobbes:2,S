Alan kindly sent one of these beasts to me, which renewed my interest
in this area.  I'll forward stuff so far.

I'd like to hear Gregs comments first - Greg knows the hotplugging code
better than me.  It appears to have its own way of decending some of the
PCI buses, but it seems unclear why it needs to supervise removal of
devices which are downstream from the hotplug slot.
As far as inserting this device, there needs to be a fair number of other
to the PCI layer to make stuff work sanely.  Currently, in order, we:
1. discovering all devices
2. once all devices have been initialised, registering each
   device with sysfs and thereby letting the drivers know.
3. apply any fixups needed
4. initialise any resources that need initialising
The drivers quite rightfully moan, and it isn't a pretty sight.
IMO, what we should be doing, in order, is:
1. discovering all devices
2. apply any fixups needed
3. initialise any resources that need initialising
4. once all devices have been initialised, registering each
   device with sysfs and thereby letting the drivers know.
We need to wait until everything is setup for step 4 because we may
(and do in the case of this split-bridge) need to program PCI-PCI
bridges before the devices become accessible.
