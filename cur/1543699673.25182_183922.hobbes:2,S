Right. You have to disconnect all but the driver requesting the reset.

OK, we agree.
There is one pathological case. We could have a device with several
interfaces of the same kind. In this case we would reenter probe, if
the reset was requested from within probe().
Could we avoid any complication if we move the rebinding to another
thread always?
