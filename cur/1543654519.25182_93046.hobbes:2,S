It looks to me like that 2.5.44 also believes that you have
two HDDs connected to VIA, and none to Promise. Did not just
2.4.20 swapped hda/hdb with hdc/hdd?
It would be really handy if you could write down logs from 2.4.20. Or
capture them with serial console.
You can also boot 2.5.x, look at which address your via lives, and
then use ide0=... parameters. I believe that via should be configured
for primary IDE, so try booting 2.4.20 with ' ide0=0x1f0,0x3f6,14'.
