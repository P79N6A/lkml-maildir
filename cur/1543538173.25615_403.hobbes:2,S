Ok, backwards. rmmod lp parport_pc; modprobe -k lp; while X running did
work. Then I set IRQ back to auto, removed and modprobed again, and
tried to move the mouse -> hang (the autodetected IRQ is 7). It's the
IRQ autoprobing. Now what I haven't done yet is to try if IRQ
autoprobing would work before X starts up (i.e. conflict only with
active PS/2 mouse).
