Jens,
I'm continuing to have serious problems running vmware under kernels which
include your changes to cdrom.c and friends.  On rare occasions it will
load and recognize the cdrom, but mostly it just complains that /dev/cdrom
is not a CD device.  The one-line change you sent me last week is helpful,
but the problem still rears its head often.
If I revert your patches, it is 100% reliable.
Steve
