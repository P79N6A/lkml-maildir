Obviously, yes. (I think that reboot on Oops should be the default).
But what about the oops report? I think that this report must be stored
somewhere. How do you want to find a bug without it?
(new bug report:  Hey, my computer crashed yesterday at 21:15.
What's wrong?)
IMHO, the swapfile is the best & portable solution: NT uses
the swapfile, I've read the Solaris uses the swapfile, too.
