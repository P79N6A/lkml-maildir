Approximately 3% to the dbench benchmark we used.
My "standard" sanity check was to mount a ramfs filesystem and execute:
dbench -t 10 30
five times and generate an average from the reported "Throughput"
numbers displayed by the runs. 
dbench was chosen merely because of the contention on dcache_lock.
