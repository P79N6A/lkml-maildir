This is correct, as (looking at other programs from cdrtools) cdrecord is the 
only program that needs realtime scheduling.

But device enumeration is the central point when implementing -scanbus.
Note that all OS that I am aware of internally use a device enumeration scheme 
that is close to what libscg uses. This ie even true for Linux. If Linux did not
hide this information for /dev/hd* based fd's, I could implement an abstraction
layer.....
