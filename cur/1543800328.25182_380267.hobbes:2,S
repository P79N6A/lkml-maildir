Indeed, i'm going soon to get some sleep but leave memtest86 running for
 the night and when i wake up then i'll see if something is reported.
It's 2x256 pc2100 ECC memory. I also expect next week monday or tuesday
new memory, which i can use to replace this memory and exclude that
eitherway.
Thanks !
