Basically yes. But if you do not want _any_ security - you can drop it.
I started using Linux (and unix in general) in '96 (thanks Linus). And
now - feelin like an experienced linux (unix) user I feel more like
ever, I do _not_ want to be root
You do not understand the unix security aspects. You do not want unix
security and do not want unix. Then stop using it. People from redmond
allow you to trash your system without any special effort.
Stop bugging us. Have you noticed you never got response from Linus? He
is probably still laughing (or feeling pissed off) - Stop trashing his
(good) work, I know he is not the only one (I thank every Linux
developer)... Did you ever realize, that the unix security model hasn't
changed radically for 30 years? Beacause what? It is (opposite your
patch) mostly good.

Ok. If you want to fuck up other people's processes, do it. Kill init
and get strange panics. If you want to crash other people's work, do
it. But begone from _my_ box!!!! Go to a bar and get drunk (as you do
not seem to have anything better to use your time for),.

Yeah. If he wants to do that he logs in as root. 'killall -1'? 'dd
if=/dev/zero of=/dev/kcore'. Yeah, crash your computer if you want. But
the 'clueless user does not want to'!

Who are you not trying to convince? You propose a patch - you try to
convince us to drop the unix secuity model...

Or the user starts up daemons. He has root privileges after all.

Ok. My mistake. You want to use 'user profiles' but not use the
advantages...
You don't have to. You can use Windows if you want to. You can just use
root. As long as you do not hack /sbin/login or xdm, you will still have
to type login/password - no win, no gain.
If it wasn't for the nips, being so good at bulding ships
the yards would still be open in the clyde
get out to a war and get shot!
