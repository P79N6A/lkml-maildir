That's true with 2.6.28, the function tracer traces on function entries only.
But there is an add-on on ftrace which let one to trace on entry and
on return, the function
graph tracer. This tracer uses this facility to output a graph of
function calls and measure
the time elapsed during each function call.
You can also register two custom handlers to do some things you need
on entry and on return.

I want to add that on the function graph tracer. That can be done
pretty easily. The only
problem comes with the type of the return value. Would this tracer be
supposed to always
return a 64 bits value regardless of the real typ of the value? There
would be some pointless bytes
on most return values. I don't know how to proceed for this problem.

I would find it useful too. I thought about something like using
early_printk or something like
that...I don't know. That would be good to redirect the output to the
tty device of the user choice.
