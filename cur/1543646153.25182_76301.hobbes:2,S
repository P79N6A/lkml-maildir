Heh, looks like you ran the thing through Lindent without looking at the
output.  Lindent is a great place to start, but it does generate lines
like the following which you will probably want to fix up by hand
(unless you really want to try to maintain things like this...)
						volume_group->
						    volume_list[AIXppent->
								lv_index -
								1]->
						    le_to_pe_map_mir1
						    [le_number].
						    pe_sector_offset = offset;
oh, here's another one that's even messier:
							volume_group->
							    volume_list
							    [AIXppent->
							     lv_index -
							     1]->
							    le_to_pe_map_mir2
							    [le_number].
							    pe_sector_offset =
							    offset;
You also have a number of local variables that use InterCaps.
But, 80 column rants aside, the code looks much better, thank you for
cleaning it up.
thanks,
