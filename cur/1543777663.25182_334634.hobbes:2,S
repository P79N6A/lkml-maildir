This patch doesn't apply to 2.6.13-rc3:
patching file drivers/net/forcedeth.c
Hunk #1 FAILED at 87.
Hunk #2 FAILED at 100.
Hunk #3 FAILED at 135.
Hunk #4 succeeded at 145 (offset -3 lines).
Hunk #5 succeeded at 295 (offset -3 lines).
Hunk #6 succeeded at 305 (offset -3 lines).

Hunk #8 succeeded at 1502 (offset -87 lines).
Hunk #9 succeeded at 2112 (offset -133 lines).
Hunk #10 FAILED at 2221.
4 out of 10 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file drivers/net/forcedeth.c.rej
I think this is because 2.6.13-rc3 has forcedeth 0.35.
I can't find the patch for 0.35 --> 0.36. (Is this when the netdev archives 
were in limbo?)
I found the patch for 0.36 --> 0.37 here : 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-netdev&m=112101962422678&w=2
Are the earlier changes a prerequisite, or can I just fix the TX handler 
rejects manually?
Thanks,
Daniel
