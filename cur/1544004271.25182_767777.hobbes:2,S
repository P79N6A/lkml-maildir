Correction.  We were not trying to address boot-time hangs but I
believe we may have been trying to address expansion ROM related
PCI resource allocation failures that we were seeing during boot
with certain PCI cards.  However, I doubt that this is relevent
to your problem.  The transparent bridge sizing removal change is
probably a red herring.
