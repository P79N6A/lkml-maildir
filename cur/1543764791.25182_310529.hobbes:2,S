Hi Linus !
Do you intend to continue posting "commited" patches to a mailing list
like bk scripts did to bk-commits-head@vger ? As I said a while ago, I
find this very useful, especially with the actual patch included in the
commit message (which isn't the case with most other projects CVS commit
lists, and I find that annoying).
If yes, then I would appreciate if you could either keep the same list,
or if you want to change the list name, keep the subscriber list so
those of us who actually archive it don't miss anything ;)
Thanks !
Regards,
Ben.
