Technically, that seems correct, but does it really matter much? We're 
talking about 
"it's full of unreclaimable stuff" vs
"it's full of unreclaimable stuff and someone tried to allocate a page".
So the difference is only ever one page, right? Doesn't really seem 
worth worrying about - we'll burn that in code space for the algorithms
to do this ;-)
