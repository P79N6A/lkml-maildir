Subject: Are working modules going to be in 2.6?

I have downloaded any number of modutil this and init-mod that, built them
static, rolled my own initrd files, and as far as I can tell it just
doesn't work with 2.5.48+.
I build my own 2.4 and early 2.5 setups, they boot, right up to the point
where the "improved" module setup comes in. Since then I have to build the
drivers in to get a boot. That's acceptable for a single test machine,
it's not desirable to build a kernel for every config I support instead of
just building a new initrd file for a new config. 
Is there any plan to get this working, or if a magician can make it work
perhaps publishing the spell?
