Adding info to the sysfs side of tty devices is rather fraught (or was
last time I looked - I'd like to do exactly that with serial_core.)
Unfortunately, until it becomes easier (and maybe it recently has now
that tty_register_device returns the class device struct), /proc/tty
needs to stay.  But... I heard that Greg wants to remove struct
class_device...
So until this area gets sorted out I'm in no hurry to make any
changes in this area.
