Hello,
 I have a SVr4 disk with a UFS filesystem. I have compiled UFS support in
the Linux kernel (2.0.34, also 2.2.1). I am unable to mount the SVr4
filesystem from Linux. When I do fdisk, it says partition type is GNU
Hurd. Fdisk also says that there is a mismatch between the physical and
logical partition boundaries. 
 Any help would be appreciated.
TIA,
Raj
