I don't think so. Original kernel gives me 2 penguins and cpuinfo shows 2 
cpu's. Kernel is 2.4.19 with xfs patches and there is no "noht" option. I 
attached a dmesg file of this one. Btw, setting the processor also sets some 
other options (CMPXCHG, TCS, PGE, ...).

Give it a try. A dual Xeon won't take to much time to compile a new kernel ;)
