   That already exists in form of a packet socket bound to the ARP
   IEEE protocol. Marc is probably right though that running an arp
   daemon all the time just for that would be a bit of overkill
   though.
Then it stands to reason that it's _really_ overkill to have this kind
of stuff in the kernel too :-)
