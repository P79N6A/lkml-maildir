Thanks for your answer. In my case only acpi_use_timer_override helps with
timing issues, enabling apic. Unfortunately,  either the options hpet=force or 
acpi_use_timer_override  don't enable HPET on asus a6t. The situation is always
the same:
cecco:/home/cecco# grep Clock /proc/timer_list
Clock Event Device: pit
Clock Event Device: lapic
Clock Event Device: lapic
I don't understand because with Turion X2 or amd64 is so difficult to have hpet
and dynticks working. Is important to have a cool notebook, but Amd doesn't seem
 to understand it. Amd has introduced C1e state for a good powersaving, saying
it is equivalent to C3 state but I haven't any prove about this.
