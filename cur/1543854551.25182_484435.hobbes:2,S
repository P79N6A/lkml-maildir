Let's go back to what gpio_request() is defined to do, though:  it very
explicitly "does NOT cause it to be configured in any way", and succeeds
unless the specified GPIO has "already been claimed".
It's addressing problems related only to software configuration:

Example, it's a bug if two drivers both thinking they manage GPIO 17.

On AT91, and AVR32, yes ... since those GPIO controllers are also
involved in pin muxing, and they use a very simple mux model.
(And if the pin were assigned as a GPIO, or not ... so what?  That
doesn't mean that's how Linux must use it.)
But in general, no ... the general case is that GPIO controller(s)
and pin muxing are two separate units in the silicon, and there's
no one-to-one coupling possible.

See my previous email, which gives detailed and very specific examples
with respect to OMAP 5912 chips you get overnight from e.g. Digikey,
and where the pin-to-gpio mapping space is many-to-many.
