How did the calling process get that UID? You might as well go all the
way, and have the calling process supply all needed capabilities.
That (a sudo-like tool for capabilities) would be a perfect for named.
The tool already exists; I think I have it somewhere on my disk even.
(named is started in one place, in a script, so this is easy)

That problem is HUGE and totally unacceptable.

The immutable bit will not survive a backup and restore. I hope
you never need to do a restore, because your system will be broken
until you remember all the places you need to set the immutable bit.

Normal exploit code:
   adjust UIDs as needed
   exec a shell
New exploit code:
   read additional code from the network
   jump to the additional code
   (then fork, allocate more memory, read more code...)
There are many ways to take over the named process. After transferring
any additional code needed, the exploit code could act as a telnet server.

I suppose there are 3 interesting cases:
Already setuid-root   -->  no problem, just add capability data
Already run as root   -->  use sucap or execcap to fix this
Not currently root    -->  like setuid-root case, but mangle the header

Yeah, what fun! I just login to a 2.0 machine, add headers I like...

I do understand. I doubt I could explain it to the average admin.
Security features are worse than useless when they are not understood.
Every UNIX security book should explain that setuid-root executables
are a risk.

If you think fixing a MASSIVE SECURITY HOLE is just slightly better,
then I ought to just ignore you.
It is critical that privileged executables be easily recognizable.
Security scripts and human admins look for the setuid bit.

We simply need a way to mark an executable as being trusted.
There are several ways to do that. Some ways only work on ext2,
some ways are portable, and some ways work only with a patch.
The kernel should fully interpret a security header when it appears
in a trusted executable, with "trusted" being defined by the admin.
You can have your broken sticky bit solution as long as I can choose
the more reliable setuid-root solution...
>> One could also add specific trusted executables in the VMS manner.
...and the above is just another way to indicate "trusted".
