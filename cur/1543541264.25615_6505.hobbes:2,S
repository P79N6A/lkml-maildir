Subject: 2.4.0-test5 puts OPTi 82C621 IDE controller in bad state

This is in a kiwi opennote laptop that I use at work.  When I first boot,
everything is fine, but once the machine reboots, linux tells me that my /
is in an inconcistant state.  This is a quad boot machine, it has 95,
nt4wkst and nt4server installed along with linux (default: linux =).  After
booting linux, I have to turn off the machine and turn it back on to reset
the ide controller.  nt won't boot and neither will 95 after being in linux.
On another laptop like this, I tested 98 and 2000 on it (also same ide
controller).  98 and 2000 cause this same problem.
The kernel I used on this laptop before was 2.3.31 which was quite stable
for me and didn't cause this problem.
Any ideas?
lspci -vvx shows this on 2.4.0-test5  if lspci -vvx is needed from 2.3.31, let
me know.
