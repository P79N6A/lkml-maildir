seems that changing in the BIOS the options:
USB mouse Support Via :
and
USB Keyboard Support Via :
from [OS] to [BIOS] removed the problem . But why linux gives this problem
and FBSD no? What this option implies ? I've noticed that the IRQ of the USB
2.0 controller changes from 12 to 5 (12 was shared with the Sound Card) ,
and the other 4 UHCI devices continue to share IRQ 10 and 11 between them .
Please , make me light on this ....
Thanks
