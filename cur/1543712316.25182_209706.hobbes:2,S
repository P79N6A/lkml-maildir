The problem is that this happens only on Macs, it doesn't seem to be a big
endian problem, as I've just tested it on a different ppc32 machine and it
works fine. So I need someone who at least tries to figure out what
happens, before I can fix this rather mysterious bug. All I know is that
something gets corrupted, but I have no idea what.
bye, Roman
