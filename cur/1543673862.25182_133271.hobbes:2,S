Hi, 
  I am trying to build the latest 2.4.20 kernel for debugging but I did
not succeed. 
I have almost all the configurables parameters that are refering to
kernel debug in make menuconfig  but when it is compiling  I do not see 
any -g option to gcc. Any ideea what I'm doing wrong ? 
Cheers, 
Nicu
