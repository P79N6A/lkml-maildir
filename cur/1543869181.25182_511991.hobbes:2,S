Distros would have to enable "standard" backlights to maximize their 
target machines. In other words they will aim for backlights from the ACPI layer 
for x86_64/ia32 machine and pmac_backlights for select ppc machines.
Specially since most default kernels on distros use only vgacon for intel 
type machines.

That is the correct solution. Basically people that select PMAC_BACKLIGHT
expect there driver to automatically to work. Basically they want 
PMAC_BACKLIGHT to work as a generic selectfor there card. I will work up a 
patch.
