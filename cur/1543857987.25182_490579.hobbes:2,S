I'm also hitting this running at commit:
commit 7bf65382caeecea4ae7206138e92e732b676d6e5

I was at 2.6.19, then merged up to Linus's tree Friday 12/8 and now I
hit this. I have 2 identical systems with one difference, one has a DVD
ROM device hooked to the ATA controller.  This system displays the same
problem.  Since the other system without the DVD worked fine with the
same code, I removed the DVD from the problem system and it boots ok.
However I need the DVD, so I guess I'll start bisecting to see what
caused this. There's about 2000 commits from 2.6.19 to my head...
More to come...
Steve.
