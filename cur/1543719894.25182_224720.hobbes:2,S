One of the things that is nice about wireless-2.6 is that is affords the 
opportunity to totally rethink the wireless extensions.
Although a lot of people would howl, since HostAP is essentially new 
code from the mainline kernel perspective, a new userland API (and new 
or updated tools) could come along with it.
I have mentioned in the past (no offense Jean!) that I do not like the 
overly-generic wireless handler structure.  It is less type-safe than is 
generally preferred in Linux, IMO.
A low-level wireless driver should not implement ioctls, it should 
implement callbacks in some sort of 'struct wireless_operations' as is 
done in other kernel subsystems.
ioctl details should be hidden from low-level drivers as much as 
possible, through type-safe interfaces.  Strive to make both the 
wireless driver API and the wireless userland API easy to change and 
evolve over time.
