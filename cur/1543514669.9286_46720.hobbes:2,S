Subject: Filesystem corruption using raid on RH6.0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I installed RH6.0 on the first 2GB of a 34GB IDE drive. The other 32GB
(save 100MB for swap) were used for a partition /dev/hda4. Another 34GB
drive was added as a slave on the same IDE contoller and partitioned
with all 34GB in /dev/hdb1.
I then created a linear raid device with the following raidtab:
raiddev /dev/md1
 raid-level linear
 nr-raid-disks 2
 persistent-superblock 0
  chunk-size 4
 device          /dev/hda4
 raid-disk       0
 device          /dev/hdb1
 raid-disk       1
The mkraid /dev/md1 went OK so I mke2fs'd (-m0 -b 4096) a filesystem on
/dev/md0. Took a long time but seemed to finished without error. I tried
to fsck the filesystem and it reported being clean.
But when I tried to mount the FS, I got the following errors:

These messages appeared during the night and seem to indicate corruption
as well on the root device /dev/hda1:

I dismantled /dev/md1 and made a filesystem on /dev/hdb1. When I mounted
it I got the following messages:

The OS is:
Oct 30 16:06:41 curlyjoe kernel: Linux version 2.2.5-15smp
(root@porky.devel.red
hat.com) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release))
#1 SMP M
on Apr 19 22:03:51 EDT 1999
Would this problem go away if I upgraded to a newer version of the OS?
Thanks
John
