One little twist here is that if I end up going through all the
current warnings to clean them up then once I know that ratio I'll
have already done all the cleanup work, so whatever the bugs/noise
ratio turns out to be, all the work will already be done and then
(from my point of view) we might as well do it ;-)
More seriously; I'll try and sift through the pile I have at the
moment and pick out those that look like real bugs, then we can look
at that and see if it's worth-while...
In any case, even if there are only very few real bugs (or even none)
I'm still full willing to do the work to help us protect against
future bugs.
