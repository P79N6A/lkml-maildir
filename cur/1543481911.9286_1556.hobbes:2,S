Being log-based Oracle is happy enough to have its redo logs on raw devices,
 the database files can stay on filesystem. However, the combo of Oracle's
 buffer cache management on raw device usually gives a better performance
 than filesystem buffering because the LRU management of the database's own
 buffer cache isn't impartial. Knowing that certain data blocks are coming
 from a full table scan implies that these blocks do not go on the MRU end
 of the LRU list. Writing is of course another matter, but you'll probably
 find that databases are written less often than they're read :) 
Also, very large volumes of data simply shouldn't be cached. When your EMC
 box deals with the monthly rollup of 20GB of tables, it is clear that the
 usually lovely 4GB RAID cache is something you would want to bypass.
Tuning depends :)
