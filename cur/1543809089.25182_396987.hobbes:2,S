I wasn't entirely happy though ;-)

Yes, Nick is correct.  For db workload, the wake-ups type are mixed.
Some of them are random, some of them are not because we do interrupt
binding.  The break down between random/fixed is about 30/70.  Thus,
Nick's patch helps 30% of time.  With sysctl, we can regain the entire
up side for db workload while retain workload on the other end of
spectrum.
