I'm btw all in favor of making mmio tracing full fledged kernel infrastructure.
This doesn't mean "notifier" imo; this means a real flag in the struct page,
and then the page fault code can do
if (page->flags & FLAG_MMIO_TRACED)
	mmio_trace(page, regs, whatever..);
(probably surrounded by a CONFIG_ ifdef)
THis is a TON lighter than a notifier chain, and actually what you want,
you don't really want a notifier, you want a call back when a special kind of
page is touched.
