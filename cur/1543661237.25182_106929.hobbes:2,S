I think it really depends on the motherboard revision. I bought one of the very
first ones, with buggy bios, unusable USB, etc..., but at least I have none of
the 3 problems you cite here. I have no PS/2 mouse plugged, and happily use it
in APIC mode. The 'pnp os' setup doesn't seem to have any effect either. But I
do have other problems, such as a DL2000 card hanging very quickly if plugged
into a 64bit PCI slot, so I use it in a 32bits one.
And it's a pain to say, but although I really like this machine, I wouldn't
recommend it for mission critical applications.

Perhaps try to stabilize it with minimal hardware first, then add all
peripherals one by one and adjust the bios for each one.
Good luck,
Willy
