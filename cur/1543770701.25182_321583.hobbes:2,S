Yes, 30 will be default for basically anyone as ahci now advertises a
max depth of 30 and the drives typically all support a depth of 32. The
minimum value of those two is used.
Whether 2-4 is 'enough' depends on your workload. But usually 2-4 is
enough to get a nice speedup on heavier io, while still getting you good
latencies on the individual io.
