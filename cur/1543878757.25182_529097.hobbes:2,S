The filesystem has two interfaces.  One to the device underneith, one to
userspace.  Read-only should certainly mean that no writes cross the
userspace interface.  Traditionally it has implicitly also meant that
no writes are crossing the device interface.  Whether that was/is an
explicit requirement - who knows.
Journaling filesystems have introduced this thing called "journal
replay".  And I have to admit, it makes thing _a lot_ easier to always
replay the journal, even when being mounted read-only.
But "it is easier" is a pretty lame excuse.

In particular, it is a lame excuse when this claim is true.  If the
block-device is read-only, then journal replay will not work as expected
and all the "not so easy" work has to be done anyway.
Did I miss anything?  Is it actually easier to mount a read-only device
with unclean journal than mounting a read-write device and not replay
the journal?
