Subject: [PATCH] ibmtr_cs: fix hang on eject
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Sent this patch a few weeks ago to the addresses listed for Token Ring 
maintainers.  No response, and the linux-tr@ address bounced.  Resent 
here in case someone wants to pick it up.  Perhaps a MAINTAINERS edit 
might be in order also.

Ejecting a PCMCIA IBM Token Ring card that has not had its dev->open() 
called will reliably trigger an uninitialized spinlock oops when spinlock 
debugging is enabled. The system then hangs, occasionally softlockup 
oopsing.  Apparently ibmtr.c:tok_interrupt() doesn't expect to be called 
before tok_open(), but tok_interrupt() gets called anyway when the card is 
ejected.  So, set an already-existing flag which causes tok_interrupt() to 
bail out early upon card ejection. Tested by inserting and removing the 
PCMCIA card several times.
Patch against 2.6.21-rc6.
