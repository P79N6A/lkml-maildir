Thanks for your reply - unfortunately the client (which uses pgcc) is
absolutely fine =) The server (using gcc 2.95.2 but the same happened with
2.7.2.3 some time ago) is the problem, I posted that with the other
information.
I have had a problem that I cannot build _anything_ with 2.7.2.3 any more
since I upgraded to the unstable tree of Debian (I know, my fault).
Setting "CC=gcc272" (which is a valid executable - the default is gcc =
2.95.2, but the gcc272 package is an additional old gcc) gives me a huge
load of errors "dereferncing pointer to incomplete type" in
/usr/include/linux. (I suspect that the include files are messed up but I
installed all the packages correctly..)
I have to tell Mandrake that pgcc is dangerous.. because they apparently
build everthing with pgcc by default.
