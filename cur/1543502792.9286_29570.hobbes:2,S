It means there is no cd in the cdrom drive. But if you type hdparm
/dev/cdrom, it should display something like:
/dev/cdrom:
 HDIO_GET_MULTCOUNT failed: Paramètre invalide
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 HDIO_GET_NOWERR failed: Paramètre invalide
 readonly     =  1 (on)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 HDIO_GETGEO failed: Paramètre invalide
The important line is "unmaskirq    =  1 (on)" which said your command
has succeed. The errors came from that a cd does  not behave like a hard
disk (it's not always present, it's read-only, it does'n support the
full eide commands but a subset named atapi , ...)
So you have not doing something wrong.
Just don't check the hdparm result in your script or do a hdparm -qu
/dev/cdrom
