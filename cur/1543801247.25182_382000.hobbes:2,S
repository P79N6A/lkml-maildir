feel free to implement an assembly mutex fastpath, and it would 
certainly be welcome and useful - but i think you are wrong about SMP 
synchronization:

a mutex is like a spinlock, it must prevent loads and stores within the 
critical section from 'leaking outside the critical section' [they must 
not be reordered to before the mutex_lock(), nor to after the 
mutex_unlock()] - hence the barriers added by atomic_dec_return() are 
very much needed.
