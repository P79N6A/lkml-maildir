Your change is not correct: bpp is the _physical_ bits per pixel, i.e. it's 16
for both color depth 15 (5/5/5 mode) and color depth 16 (5/6/5).
To differentiate between 5/5/5 and 5/6/5, you have to look at green.length, and
apply standard fbdev fit-our-round-up[*] rules.
Note that some hardware in addition does RGBA4444, too.
