yep, this does the trick, however, this is just a brown paper bag over the issue, afaict.
Most of the usb serial drivers do something in the likes of
	struct usb_serial_port *port = (struct usb_serial_port *) urb->context;
	...
	tty = port->tty;
	...
	tty_insert_flip_{char,string,..}(tty,..)
in their _indat_callback()s.
In the keyspan case the port->tty is being accessed already in the ->open() function
from usb_console_setup(), before setting the termios settings and later again in the
_indat callback. I'm clearly missing the big picture here so what is the proper way
to initialize termios settings correctly in a driver?
