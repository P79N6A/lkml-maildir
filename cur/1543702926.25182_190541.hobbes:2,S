hmmm, I'll have to think on this one a bit.  You are described observed 
behavior here... can you go a bit deeper, and describe what two code 
paths are racing?  I think I might a _different_ race in the code we're 
looking at, but I do not yet see the race you are describing :(

Well -- A signal won't be pending until after you call 
schedule_timeout() ;-)  A signal, particularly SIGINT, might even occur 
_during_ the schedule_timeout().
