We had docs and Broadcom's GPL'd driver.

You're changing your story.  After first over-simplifying what Greg 
posted, you were complaining about Greg being disingenuous, when in fact 
Greg was doing nothing but describing (in a new and different way) how 
Linux drivers are already written.
Furthermore, presuming that drivers "definitely won't be maintained by 
volunteers" is rather presumptuous considering that volunteers are 
lining up, according to Greg.
I'm glad I didn't have a negative nelly like you around when I first got 
into fbdev driver hacking, my entry into the Linux kernel world.  "Don't 
bother, son, nobody wants you around anyway."
