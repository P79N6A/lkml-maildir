That a fairly unique problem, and is most likely in a minority 
application.  For that case a CONFIG option to ignore the 
firmware-provided command line would make sense.  I do not believe it 
should be the only option or even the default.
It would be particularly good if this could be standardized across 
architectures, which is another reason to do it right.
