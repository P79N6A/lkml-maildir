Why? As Masami indicated in an earlier reply, the annotation is to
prevent *only* kprobes.

Well.. we pass on control of a !kprobe breakpoint to the kernel. This is
exactly what permits debuggers like xmon to work fine now. I don't see
any harm in such breakpoints being handled autonomously without any sort
of kprobe influence.
