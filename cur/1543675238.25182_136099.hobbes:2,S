Yes. It's fixable, and I think that's a good project for 2.7, but I really
don't think that level of change is justified at the moment. Testing this
stuff is a pain in the ass, it's a lot of work to do properly and carefully.
And what does that change buy us in reality? Not a lot. 
I agree it would be nice to do ... just not the focus during a 2.6 
stabilisation effort, when we have so many other more important things to
work on, that would have real impact.
