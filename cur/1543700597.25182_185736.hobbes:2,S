Hi!
I just wanted to send kudos, as this version seems to be the first one
which does not generate a kernel panik just from the very start. It was
also possible to transfer ~20GB (firewire attached ide-hd) via the sbp2
module and then removing the sbp2/ohci1394/ieee1394 module several times
without it oopsing (that was enough last time I checked to generate a
kernel panik!)
Regards,
Soeren.
