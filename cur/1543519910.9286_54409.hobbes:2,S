I have the thermal paste and a cooler on top of the BX chip. This was
stable for about a month before it started hanging again last week.
It just froze on me while playing an MP3, and displaying the
screensaver, while I was involved with some paper. This is the first
time that it crashes on me while I'm in the room. Otherwise it only
crashes when I'm away. The screensaver had kicked in, but X hadn't
blanked the screen yet. 
My machine is normally not playing MP3s when it crashes.
I'm going to look into the 'breaking a spinlock' thingy, hoping that
it might turn up something....
My system is IDE, although I have an NCR875 card installed. (currently
nothing connected).
