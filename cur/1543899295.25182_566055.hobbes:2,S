Hmm, are we still adding new IDE drivers? Do you also have a
driver for the new libata layer? I think it would even be
simpler to do.
You could also make it an of_platform_driver at the same time
instead of adding more cruft to fsl_soc.c. Since we're already
about to add the electra_ide.c driver in 2.6.23, I guess there
should really be _one_ driver that is able to handle all
of_device based ATA hosts.
