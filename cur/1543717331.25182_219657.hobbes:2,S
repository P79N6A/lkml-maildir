Oliver was right about not using interfaces after they have been released.
I think the best approach will be for the hci_usb_disconnect() routine to 
release both interfaces when it is called.  Something like this:
    In hci_usb.h, add to struct hci_usb:
	struct usb_interface		*acl_iface;
    In hci_usb_probe, add near the end:
	husb->acl_iface = intf;
    In hci_usb_disconnect, add:
	/* Always release both interfaces whenever we must release either */
	if (intf == husb->isoc_iface)
		usb_driver_release_interface(&hci_usb_driver,
				husb->acl_iface);
	else if (husb->isoc_iface)
		usb_driver_release_interface(&hci_usb_driver, 
				husb->isoc_iface);
It's not necessary to set the interface private pointers back to NULL, 
since the USB core will do that for you when the interface is released.
