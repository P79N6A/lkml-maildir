Single-mouse-click configuration isn't going to happen soon.  It may 
not happen at all.
However, I believe pushing in that direction is worthwhile.
Configuration *can* be made a helluva lot easier than it is now.
Easier than I think most kernel developers would believe possible, at
least before sitting down to a serious think and abandoning a lot of
long-held assumptions about how things `have' to be.
CML2 was the first step.  It gives us a tool that can guarantee the
correctness and consistency of configuration changes according to a
rulebase.
The autoconfigurator that Giacomo Catenazzi started, which I am now
integrating with CML2, is the next step.  I expect it to reduce the
task complexity for typical configuration cases by 90%.  It's pretty
effective, including more than 2500 probes.
I don't know what the third step will be yet.  It depends partly on what
that remaining 10% looks like.
