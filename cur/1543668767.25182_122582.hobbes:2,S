Actually I've seen several CFs fail when used in LBA mode, not just 
those partitioned with cfdisk. I claim there's either a problem of
the manufacturers taking commands with LBAs or some driver problem
on the linux to address the CFs correctly.
Anyway, I see this as rather minor; drop down to CHS in BIOS and
everything works fine (here at least).
