just notice console handover patch got into mainline 5/8.
for early_uart_console, I have some ideas:
1. merged that into early_serial_console in
arch/x86_64/kernel/early_printk.c, and
move early_printk.c to kernel/, --- make it understand
     earlyprintk=uart,io,0x3f8,9600n8
     earlyprintk=uart,mmio,0xff5e0000,115200n8
in addition to vga, ttyS, serial
2. or make early_uart_console to be another CON_BOOT, and get rid of
late_initcall(early_uart_console_switch).
actually with late_initcall early_uart_console_switch instead of
console handover, we will lose char output from serial drv init to
late_initcall stage.
in this case, we need to EARLY_SERIAL_CONSOLE to select
early_serial_console or early_uart_console for x86_64 platform.
