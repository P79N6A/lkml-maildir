I haven't watched your videos yet but I tried one of the patches
  - with make xconfig: OK
  - with make gconfig: OK
  - with make menuconfig: less so, because:
When one switches a menuconfig _on_, one might miss that there are
subsequent options to configure.  (Although the availability of further
options is indicated by the '--->' suffix to the menu title.)
