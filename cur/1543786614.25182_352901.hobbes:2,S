Which has the potential to spam the logs with a user triggerable event
without even killing the responsible process.
Same problem, just worse.
I could live with a solution that enables it based on a config.
KERNEL_HACKING is no such config. That feature is almost always
enabled, because MAGIC_SYSRQ depends on it and a significant amount
of Linux-Admins like it for a "sync, remount ro and reboot" sequence.
So you need a new one.
