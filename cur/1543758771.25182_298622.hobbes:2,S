This is userland API. It should not change in random way during stable
series...
...but adding new /sys/power/state might be okay. We should not have
introduced "standby" in the first place [but I guess it is not worth
removing now]. If something has more than 2 states (does user really
want to enter different states in different usage?), I guess we can
add something like "deepmem" or whatever. Is there something with more
than 3 states?
