After applying DaveM's SPARC jumbo patch, I got the same warnings
(including the warnings about negative shift couts, etc.) as
bwoodward@cisco.com.
Also, during boot, the ESP SCSI driver hangs trying to detect devices.
Boot messages from 2.1.130:
----BEGIN----

The machine hangs at this point.  (The second line may be incorrect - I'm
not near my SPARC at the moment, but I do recall "Time-Out" became "TOut",
at least.)
Also, the DBRI sound module still won't build, complaining about
drivers/isdn/hisax/foreign.h.  I have yet to even determine what kind of
audio hardware I have in the SS10 - the drivers won't build at all in
2.1.130, and 2.2.0-pre7 refuses to find my hard disks.
While I'm on this topic, does the repeated use of the word "fast" coupled
with the 40 MHz clock mean I can use ultrawide SCSI devices on this
controller?
If I've left anything out, please contact me.
