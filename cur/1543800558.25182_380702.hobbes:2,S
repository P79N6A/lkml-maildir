Not really.  Your example, as Linus already explained, is a great
example of how _not_ to inline stuff.  If in doubt, don't inline.  If
a function is called just once, don't inline unless there are other
good reasons for it.  If you get a minimal gain (10 bytes) in text
size, don't inline.  The maintenance issue is more important.
