That's my intention, eventually, but currently that would cause some requests
to get dropped - when the kernel finds no entry, but has to call up to mountd,
it just drops the request until mountd gives it a definite export entry, be
that negative or positive.
I want to find some way of keeping those requests, so we don't have to wait 
for the client to resubmit them.
I was thinking of just feeding the whole thing up to mountd, and then trying 
to find some way for mountd to stick it back into the request queue if it's 
authorised.
I don't know if that's going to be possible without a fairly evil hack to the 
sunrpc layer. Perhaps it would be better to have an alternative return 
response from the *_dispatch routines which tells sunrpc to 'try me again in 
<N> jiffies'  instead?
