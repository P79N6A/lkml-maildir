This bit is an equivalent to 2.4 code in pc_keyb.c, that adds a
workaround for IBM PowerPC portables, which don't seem to support
translated mode:
       /* ibm powerpc portables need this to use scan-code set 1 -- Cort * */
        if (!(kbd_write_command_w_and_wait(KBD_CCMD_READ_MODE) & KBD_MODE_KCC))
        {
                /*
                 * If the controller does not support conversion,
                 * Set the keyboard to scan-code set 1.
                 */
                kbd_write_output_w(0xF0);
                kbd_wait_for_input();
                kbd_write_output_w(0x01);
                kbd_wait_for_input();
        }
As you can see, this sets the keyboard to scancode set 1, if
KBD_MODE_KCC (which is 0x40, same as I8042_CTR_XLATE), bit is set.
This should break your keyboard as well, if it supports mode setting.
I guess we could kill that bit, and ignore the old PowerPCs ....

Yes. The translate/don't bit is documented by IBM, though.

Does the machine by any chance have a PS/2 mouse port? If not, it may be
the reason - it would have an AT-style i8042, and those might not be
implementing that bit.
We could skip the above check if we don't detect the AUX port.
