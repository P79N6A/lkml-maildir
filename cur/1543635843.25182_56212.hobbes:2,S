I tried setting conf/arp_filter, proxy_arp, and looked at rp_filter but
didn't try anything with it. I'm using tcpdump on the machine sending
who-has and getting two packets back. I tried the obvious setting eth0 and
1, setting default, and setting 'all." The current settings, just the NICs
in question, are producing two arp-replies with settings:
newsmst01:conf# for n in */arp_filter;do echo $n; cat $n; done
all/arp_filter
0
default/arp_filter
0
eth0/arp_filter
1
eth1/arp_filter
1
lo/arp_filter
0
newsmst01:conf# 
This was with 2.4.19-pre10ac2+one smp locking patch.
Oh well, thanks anyway, if it's intended to work that way I'll look at
making it so.
