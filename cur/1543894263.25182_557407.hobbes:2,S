Not to the software installed in the device.
What they do is like an author A who distributes a program to user B
under a non-Free Software license, and to user C under a Free Software
license.
C passes the program on to B under the same license.  Now B has two
copies of the program.  One is free, the other is not.
Except that TiVO had no right to distribute the program under non-Free
terms in the first place, because it was not the author, and the
license it had explicitly said it couldn't impose further
restrictions.
