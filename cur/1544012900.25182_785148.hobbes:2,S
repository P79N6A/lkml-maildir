You can grab it, although currently the trees are undergoing some
changes, so what you pull today might now be there tomorrow..
Try to grab git://oss.sgi.com/xfs-cmds, it's in the xfstests subdir.
The QA harness currently only runs on xfs, nfs and udf, but this
particular test program should work on any fs if run outside the
testharness.
