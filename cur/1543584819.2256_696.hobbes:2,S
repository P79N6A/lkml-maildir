This is why I wish glibc would drop the whole idea of relying on
seekdir/telldir existing. The LFS does in fact not specify any
equivalent seekdir64/telldir64, and most implementations of *NIX don't
support them.
Currently, the VFS only allows us to support the minimum
implementation which is required to support the 32-bit interface.

I've got a more complete one. See the 'IRIX' patch on
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/2.4.2/linux-2.4.2-dir.dif
That patch also sign-extends 32-bit cookies at the NFS level, so that
we can
  a) convert cookies back so that the server accepts them
  b) match sign-extended 32-bit cookies in the page cache

Yes and no. All NFSv3 implementations are supposed to support 32-bit
client implementations. All you lose here is the ability to handle
multi-Gigabyte directories.
