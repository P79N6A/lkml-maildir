This is basically a kernel workaround for stupid app behavior.  It wouldn't be 
the first time we've provided such an option, but we shouldn't do it without a 
very good justification.  At the very least, we need a test case that 
demonstrates the problem and benchmark results that prove that this approach 
actually fixes it.  I suspect we can find a cleaner fix for the problem.
