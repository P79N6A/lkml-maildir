Perhaps I came off too strong, but I meant what I said, and I'm not only
talking about things being made clear with Eben and the FSF. Frankly, I 
don't know what did or did not happen behind closed doors and it would be 
wrong of me to make assumptions about that.
What I was really addressing here is that the whole F/OSS community 
exploded over the news that Linux was not adopting the GPLv3. I think it's 
fair to say that the reason why Linux is not adopting GPLv3 (aside from 
the very practical matter of gaining the consensus of copyright holders)
is that Linus and other top copyright holders don't think what Tivo is 
doing is wrong. But when that statement first came out, it was almost lost 
in the noise of "The FSF is not going to listen to us, and what about 
encryption keys?" The former probably has no place outside of LKML; the 
latter is the sort of thing you'd bring up at gplv3.fsf.org if you wanted 
to participate in the process.
So a lot of people spent a lot of time thinking Linus was just confused 
about the license and its intentions and that if they could just show him 
why he was reading it wrong he'd change his mind. The point I'm trying 
to make here about what _should_ have happened a lot sooner is that the 
problem should have been defined in the simplest possible terms: "We don't 
want to cut off Tivo. We don't think they are in the wrong." Then it boils 
down to a simple difference in philosophy and everyone can move on.
