sounds good, maybe linux-vserver and bsdjail can
share/utilize common code/functionality here?
(will have a look at the code soon)
also interresting enhancements might be
 - private namespaces (linux-vserver uses them)
 - certain virtualizations (loadavg, ...)
anyway, let me know if you are interested in
any cooperation ...
best,
Herbert
