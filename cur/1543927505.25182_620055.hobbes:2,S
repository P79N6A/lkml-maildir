Not neccessarily. It could a bug in one of the drivers using IRQ 21
(sata_nv or the nvidia ethernet), it could be another inactive device, or
it could be a hardware funny.
Nvidia stuff can be quite hard to diagnose as we have no documentation
but we can try. The first question is whether it is network or disk
triggered - seeing if heavy loads to one or the other trigger the problem
might be a first plan.
