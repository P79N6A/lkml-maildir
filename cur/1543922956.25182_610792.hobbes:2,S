Drift...
Is that something netperf should be using though?  Right now it uses the regular 
SO_[SND|RCV]BUF calls and is at the mercy of sysctls.  I wonder if it would be 
better to have it use their FORCE versions to make life easier on the 
benchmarker - such as myself - who has an unfortunate habit of forgetting to 
update sysctl.conf :)
