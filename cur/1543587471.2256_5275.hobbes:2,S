Forgot some things...
It also happens with dd, so it's not a bug in tar.
If I set the tar blocksize to 512 bytes, the offset changes to 512 bytes as
well.
If I set the tar blocksize to 57*512 bytes, I didn't see a problem (however,
could have been `good luck').
The problem seems to be there since at least 2.4.0-test1-ac10, which means
quite some people may no longer have known good backups of their valuable data
(of course we should not run 2.[34].x kernels on our systems, right? :-)
Since you have a different SCSI host adapter, the problem is most likely in
st.c. I was thinking of writing `predictable' data (or checksummed blocks or
so) to tape and add some data verification tests to st.c at the very last
moment before it sends a write command to the SCSI host adapter, but I haven't
found time for that yet.
