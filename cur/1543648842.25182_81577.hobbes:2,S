This is a very interesting architecture. Could you describe vaguely (for
someone starved enough for time he might have trouble finding time to
examine your tree) how cpu wakeup with the VIC proceeds?
Also, I'd like to say this patch is impressively isolated from generic
i386 code. Although I've not tested, it seems very clear from the form
of the code that it will have no impact on UP i386 or other subarches.
Thanks,
Bill
