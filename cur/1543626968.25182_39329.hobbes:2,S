how nice of you to say so.  As to automating, I don;t believe it can
work.  You will be adding volume to the log, making the log processing
more complicated, a replay of EES.

The poor sod who has to maintain this stuff.

Information that only the kernel has is not what I'm talking about, it
is all the stuff to make it easy to parse and collate, it has to be
possible, not necessarly easy.

What? generate reports that will be munged for statistics that will be
quoted in endless management meetings.

But you could get 90% of the advantage for much less effort by fixing
the problems with printk/klogd without implementing yet another
subsystem.

And this could be avoided using the "improved printk" by not compiling
the new features.
