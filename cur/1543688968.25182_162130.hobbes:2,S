Hi All,
I want to insert a module which will add a proprietary encapsulation header
(specific to our systems) and then send out the ppp packet over serial
interface (it will either be a High speed serial interface or a V.35
interface).
How do i insert a module between ppp and hdlc modules ?. Are there any
documents
which tells more about using the Channel Interface in ppp ?
Do i need to emulate a tty for doing this ?
Thanks,
Vanitha
