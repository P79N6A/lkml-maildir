The machine reboots before syslog gets to run.
What happens is:
	printk();
	reboot();
During that period, syslog is unable to run, and therefore is unable to
write the log message to disk.

I suppose you could modify softdog to delay the reboot using it's timer
(the timer fires the first time, you check data to see if it's non-zero.
If it's not, increment watchdog_ticktock.data, and set the watchdog to
timeout in 5 seconds, return).
You should probably prevent softdog_write updating the timer if the
data field is non-zero, so once you don't change the behaviour; this
is of course dependent on your test case.
