That is quite deliberate.
open() is supposed to generate an RPC call in order to ensure that
cached attributes (and hence cached data) are still valid (this is
part of what is known as NFS 'close-to-open' cache consistency).
If you are certain that you will never access the same file/directory
from 2 different machines, you can try to mount with the 'nocto' mount
option.
