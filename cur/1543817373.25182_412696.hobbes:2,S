Things like unused modules or loadable module support should have more 
or less zero impact on stack usage.

The -rt kernel contains something like this.

This has been discussed to death, and the consensus was that code 
resulting in a too high stack usage should be fixed.
If you find any stack problems with 4k stacks and the automatically 
enabled unit-at-a-time when using gcc 4.x in kernel 2.6.16-mm2, please 
send a bug report.
Regarding unit-at-a-time with gcc 3.x, it works most time for most 
people, but it's completely unsupported. If you want to use 
unit-at-a-time on i386, please use gcc 4.x.
