As I understand it if Vladis wants to submit his own change to the symbol
thats up to him, and he'll be liable for any fallout with the FSF, or
harm to Linux resulting, so long he's the one who signs it off.
If its FSF code perhaps it would be polite for Vladis to ask the FSF
first if he wants to do it nicely.
