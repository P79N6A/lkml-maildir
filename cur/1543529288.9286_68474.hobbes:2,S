Are you sure?  I gather that once you've started ACPI, you're not
supposed to call the APM BIOS calls.
Because of that, I would think that some APM BIOS power-off code assumes
some things about the state of the hardware, which may no longer be true
once you've started ACPI.  Things that might cause the APM power off
sequence to fail, perhaps in nasty ways.  At very least, that condition
was probably never tested by the BIOS manufacturers.
