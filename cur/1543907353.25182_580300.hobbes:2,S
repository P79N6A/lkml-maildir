Well, I can hardly argue with that thorough analysis. :)
I still like the idea of having the control in the core as much as
possible though. It allows people to experiment and figure out new and
clever ways of solving this in a way that can benefit all drivers.
So could we do most of what you propose, where we set the block size to
maximum, yet <= 512. Drivers can tweak this further by calling
sdio_force_block_size() (as need e.g. by my marvell card), and keep the
convention of 0 meaning "back to core default"? That way we can modify
the meaning of "core default" if more clever ways are available.

Right, sorry. It was late when I was hacking on this.

Quite right. I had no doubts that thing had room for improvement. But I
agree that we might as well select a fixed block size and stick with it
for the general case.
