 #ifdef DEBUG
-#define dbg(format, arg...) printk(KERN_DEBUG __FILE__ ": " format "\n" , ## arg)
+#define dbg(format, arg...) printk(KERN_DEBUG __FILE__ ":%s - " format "\n", __FUNCTION__, ## arg)
 #else
I was going to suggest you use the C99 __func__ rather than
__FUNCTION__ but after a quick test it doesn't seem to be supported by
egcs-2.91.66 so I guess that is out for the time being?  It is
supported by gcc-2.95 though.
