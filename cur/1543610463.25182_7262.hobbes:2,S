	Yes, this is true.  Rough enough as it is.  As one of the (minor)
device driver maintainers, I expect to test some of these versions (some
of which may be unexpectedly radioactive) as quick as I can and I keep
backs so my systems can be booted when a new version is unbootable (very
rare now days, thankfully).  This did NOT help that cause.  Making life
MORE difficult is not the way to get people to TEST things.
