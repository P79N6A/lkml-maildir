Well I do use hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda in init to set dma to 1. I know called
hdparm -d 0 /dev/hda and tried again, but it still fails. Do you mean
hdparm should not touch the device at all and a reboot without the hdparm
-d 1 /dev/hda would do the job? I could live with that for the moment, as
I don't have to repartition my drive very often...
