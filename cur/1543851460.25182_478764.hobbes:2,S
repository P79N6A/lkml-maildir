Hi!
> The purpose of the appended patch is to make swsusp work on i386 with PAE,

> 
> The patch creates temporary page tables located in resume-safe page frames
> during the resume and uses them for restoring the suspend image (the same
> approach is used on x86-64).
> 
> It has been tested on an i386 system with PAE and survived several
> suspend-resume cycles in a row, but I have no systems without PSE, so that
> requires some testing.

> Comments welcome.
