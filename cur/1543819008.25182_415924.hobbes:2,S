What we have in mind is something like 
http://test.kernel.org/
 for each
patch set. I guess we will start humbly at the beginning :)
Initially, the idea was to test the patch series we've been sending on
lkml. But as we've been running tests on existing solutions, openvz,
vserver, and our own prototype, we thought that extending to all was
interesting and fair.
The goal is to promote lightweight containers in the linux kernel, so this
needs to be open.

We've been working on that topic for a long time, we are very interested in
seeing what you've acheived ! Migration tests is also an interesting topic
we could add with time to the containers tests.
thanks,
C.
