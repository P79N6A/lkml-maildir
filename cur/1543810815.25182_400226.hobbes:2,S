Currently some people can't suspend with the mainline code because it cannot
free as much memory as needed on their boxes.  I think we should care for them
too.
Besides, if they could suspend, we'd have more users and more testing coverage
for device drivers, especially for devices that are no longer installed in
newer boxes. ;-)
