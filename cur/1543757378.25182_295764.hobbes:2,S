gcc has very much less developers than the kernel. It has worked for years
around CVS' shortcommings, plus being a core GNU package, it is quite
unlikely to /ever/ go for a non-oss SCM. Plus the bureaucracy (have to have
a paper signing over ownership to the FSF for any changes) make a fully
Linux-style development unlikely (and thus BK (which was designed as SCM
for the kernel) not really useful).
