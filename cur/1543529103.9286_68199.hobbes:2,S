I've been thinking about this change and still don't see what good it 
does.
On a UP -- no change except code is more complex
On a SMP box  performance loss without using affinity.
        Take two spinlocks instead of one, more cache boucing etc.
One a SMP box using affinit  no gain over just using affinity
   except whn we assign edge interrupts for one cpu and level to 
   a second and even then it is hard to imagine that it does anything
   good. I think you are optimizing for a coner case of an 8 way box at
   the expense of everything else.
The second problem is this idea of blocking _all_ interrupts on an IOAPIC
during the execution of a level interrupt handler. This seems like a definite
performance loss on a dual SMP where one processor would otherwise be able
to take and service an irq while the other handleed a different irq.
