I'm thinking along the lines of a 2Ghz P4 box performing skipless .mp3
playing, that is not able to compile the Linux kernel in anything less
than 24 hours.
This is where this reasoning takes us. "It's skipless it must be better!"

P.S. My .mp3 player doesn't skip when I perform heavy compiles. With
     the low-latency patches, this record should only improve. Hammers
     are for nails.
