I tend to agree. Especially since in some cases (i.e. after
a long compilation (read : lots of code)), the VM has the most
excellent idea to swap out all the GUI (X+apps) and everyone
here knows how long it can be to restore the GUI in that case.
Obviously the problem is very much lessened, in my case, when
i put the swap partition on the *other* drive than the root fs.
Both are ATA100 (40GB 60GXPs), and the system is more responsive
with swap on hdc while / in on hda, than both on hda.
