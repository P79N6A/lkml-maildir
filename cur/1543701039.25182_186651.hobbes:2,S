Does everyone who has this problem by chance have it occuring on an 
atapi cd recorder.  As of 2.6.0-mm1 my cd recorder is being labeled read 
only by the ide-cd driver.  Meaning, no matter if i set the readonly 
flag in hdparm to 0, cdrecord and others will refuse to write to the 
drive because it's being told it's read only.  I do not have fam loaded 
at the time of this testing.  Are there new ide-cd arguments required to 
use atapi cd writers in native mode?
