Hmm; here is Jeremy Allison's quote, describing something
he did with an SGI he was testing:
"Like Mindcraft, we also bound the interrupts from each network card
to a processor. This allows concurrent interrupts not to cause a
processor cache flush, which is an expensive operation."
I'm not a kernel internals genius; just trying to get a feel for
what impact these things have on system performance.
Thanks for the reply!

   It is better to dynamically share the CPU. NT has shortcomings which
   can be reduced a bit by that kind of tuning.
