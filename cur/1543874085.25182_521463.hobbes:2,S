You can't point it at NULL, we don't point it at loopback
just for fun.
There can be asynchronous paths elsewhere in the networking still
referencing the neigh or dst and they will (correctly) feel free to
derefence whatever device is hanging there.  So transitioning
to NULL is invalid.
You guys will need to come up with a better solution for this silly
situation with network namespaces.  Loopback is always available to
point dead routes and neighbour entries at, and this assumption is
massively rooted in the networking.
