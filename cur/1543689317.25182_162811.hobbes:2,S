Try the usb_set_configuration() patch I just posted this morning
(to linux-usb-devel).
Apply it, and you'll still get these messages ... but then you'll
be able to
    # echo 2 > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1.2/bConfigurationValue
and then it should work as before.  Granted that works as I expect,
I'll submit a cdc-acm patch later to get rid of the need for the
manual workaround.  And meanwhile, a hotplug script could automate
this for you, in /etc/hotplug/usb/cdc-acm ...
