The system bus does not need to be serialised because the CPU already
holds the cacheline in exclusive state. That *is* the cache coherency
protocol.
The memory ordering is enforced by the CPU effectively preventing
speculative loads to pass the locked instruction and ensuring all
stores reach the cache before it is executed. (I say effectively
because the CPU might do clever tricks without you knowing).
