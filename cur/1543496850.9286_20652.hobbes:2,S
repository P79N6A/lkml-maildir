While trying to figure out why the load on one of my machines was always
above 1, I ran across a process which appears to be stuck in an
uninterruptible sleep:
ps auwxl reports:
   100   511 23662 23654   0   0   1264   840 wake_up     D   pb  0:00
-bash 
There is nothing else on ttypb. I'm pretty sure this process was started
via screen.
I assume this is what is causing the odd load average.
The machine is a Dual P2/350 w/ 256meg of ram. It doesn't seem to be a
hardware issue, so I'll leave the rest out, but if someone is curious,
I'll make a more complete report.
The machine is up and seemingly stable (still serving half a million
hits a day). I can do any non intrusive tests people want as well
(sorry, I can't try another kernel until the weekend at the earliest)
