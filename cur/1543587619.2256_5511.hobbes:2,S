I can't reproduce it with ttyconfig either. But here is how to reproduce it 
reliably with menuconfig:
make mrproper
rm .config
rm config.out
make menuconfig
down
down
right
right
[Now in cpu selection have a Y next to M686.]
down to M586TSC
y
msg: M686=n (deduced from M586TSC)
enter to dismis msg
up
[now at M586]
y
msg: M586TSC=n (deduced from M586)
enter to dismis msg
down
[now back at M586TSC]
y
msg: M586=n (deduced from M586TSC)
enter to dismis msg
[now have a Y for both M586TSC and M686]
y
[nothing happens, as it is already 'y' it's expected]
down
[now notice colouring: M586TSC is green while M686 is grey like the rest]
down
[now at M686 which has the second y but is grey]
y
[nothing happens, as it is 'y' it's expected, but it shouldn't be 'y']
down
[now at MPENTIUMIII]
y
msg: M586TSC=n (deduced from MPENTIUMIII)
      M686=n (deduced from MPENTIUMIII)
enter to dismis msg
[only one Y left at expected position MPENTIUMIII]
I cannot reproduce any of this using make ttyconfig I am afraid...
The above in/output was with CML2 1.1.2.
There must be something... Can you reproduce this? I gave you all 
keypresses I used. I can reproduce it every time.
If I press 'x' after the two 'Y' have appeared at the same time and look at 
the generated .config it says:
# Intel and compatible 80x86 processor types
#
# CONFIG_M386 is not set
# CONFIG_M486 is not set
# CONFIG_M586 is not set
CONFIG_M586TSC=y
# CONFIG_M586MMX is not set
CONFIG_M686=y
# CONFIG_MPENTIUMIII is not set
# CONFIG_MPENTIUM4 is not set
# CONFIG_MK6 is not set
# CONFIG_MK7 is not set
# CONFIG_MCRUSOE is not set
# CONFIG_MWINCHIPC6 is not set
# CONFIG_MWINCHIP2 is not set
# CONFIG_MWINCHIP3D is not set
# CONFIG_MCYRIXIII is not set
And config.out contains:
# Intel and compatible 80x86 processor types
#
CONFIG_M386=n
CONFIG_M486=n
CONFIG_M586=n
CONFIG_M586TSC=y
CONFIG_M586MMX=n
CONFIG_M686=y
CONFIG_MPENTIUMIII=n
CONFIG_MPENTIUM4=n
CONFIG_MK6=n
CONFIG_MK7=n
CONFIG_MCRUSOE=n
CONFIG_MWINCHIPC6=n
CONFIG_MWINCHIP2=n
CONFIG_MWINCHIP3D=n
CONFIG_MCYRIXIII=n
This shows quite cleary that the state really is messed up indeed.
Let me know if you cannot reproduce this stil...
If there is anything I can help to narrow this down let me know (I don't 
know any Python I am afraid). Once I have my permanent netconnection back 
to home (will take a few days) I can give you a ssh shell account on this 
system if it would be helpful. At the moment the only interaction with the 
world is using a floppy disk or my Windows box and the modem in my Nokia 
7110... )-:
Best regards,
         Anton
