Sorry, disabling exec is security by obscurity (it will deter 95%
attacks, still!). You can do exec without actually invoking exec
system call -- you close some fds, mmap executable somewhere into your
address space, unmap old files ... and you've done exec() without
actually doing exec. (Mj's freezer does something pretty similar --
for example he could freeze bash then unfreeze it into your web
server!)
