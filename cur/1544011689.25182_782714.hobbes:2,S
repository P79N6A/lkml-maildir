I'm not the best person to answer, but if you enable TICKLESS kernel
and ACPI power states (and run one of the powersave governors,
basically treating your desktop like a laptop) then your CPUs will use
very little power.
You should be able to get an idea of the power being used by your
system by seeing how much time it spends in C1/C2/C3, using the
powertop application from 
http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/powertop/
it will also give suggestions about how to optimize your system.  Why
disable cores when the system will effectively do it for you?  If
you're really serious about conserving power, get a power meter that
goes between your power plug and the wall and measure the wattage
being consumed by your system.
