I assume the reason for including the synchro-test.ko module in the
standard kernel is to get people to run it :)
I realize that it's ofcourse most useful when it finds bugs, but I
thought it might be interresting to get some results from people even
when it doesn't find any bugs, so here are some results from a Athlon
64 X2 4400+ system running a 32bit 2.6.16-rc4-mm1 SMP kernel :
# insmod /lib/modules/2.6.16-rc4-mm1/kernel/kernel/synchro-test.ko 
mx=19 sm=18 ism=17 rd=14 wr=11 dg=7 elapse=180 load=5 interval=3
do_sched=1 v=1
# dmesg | tail -n 12
