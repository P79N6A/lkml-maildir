The logic in the kernel seems backwards here though.  We start
by assuming there is a keyboard, then when parsing the FADT
we reset this assumption if the BAF_8042_KEYBOARD_CONTROLLER
bit isn't set.  Which in turn forced SGI to include some
workaround code for their older PROM (which doesn't provide
the FADT table).
There's also a risk that if some code might get added that
runs before we parse FADT that could be confused into thinking
that the keyboard is present.
Wouldn't it be simpler/better to assume there is no keyboard until
we find positive evidence that there is one?
