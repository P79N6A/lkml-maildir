Nick,
	I was going thr' build_sched_domains and had a question
regarding formation of sched_groups for NUMA nodes. There are two 'for'
loops, each loop possibly allocating memory (sched_group) for one or more nodes.
My question is: in the outer loop, don't we need to skip allocating for
nodes for whom the inner loop has allocated in an earlier pass?
Taking the example of 4 node system which are in the same
sched_domain_node_span(), I see that we end up allocating 16
times (when 4 would have sufficed?).
What am I missing here?
