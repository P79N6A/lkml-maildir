I don't know if there can be such a thing as "final result" on these
kinds of questions, but yes, this one pops up regularly.  I agree with
Alan, who said (not long ago) that you are free to split the kernel up
yourself, maybe diddle the makefiles so they don't look for what isn't
there, or whatever.  That is your right under the GNU GPL.  You could
even make a web site out of it, allowing people to tick the portions
they wanted and download one customized tarball.
