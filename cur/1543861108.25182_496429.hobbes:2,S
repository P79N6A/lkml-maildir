Hi,
  I own a Sony Vaio VGN-SZ340 and I had problems regarding acpi + it's
dual core processor. The guys from Intel gave me a workaround and now
it recognises both cores.
  The problem is that it does not do cpu frequency scaling for both
cores, just for cpu0...And when I boot with acpi the Nvidia graphic
card doesnt work also.
  I don't know if you know about these problems regarding sony acpi.
The guys from Intel said that this notebook have 2 dst's. So to detect
both cores the workaround just uses the second dst (although frequency
scaling does work for both.)
  I can help you to fix this bug...I have the machine where we can do
some tests..
Best regards,
