There has been updates since then.
There's been a newer stable Slackware release since 10.0. Slackware
10.1 was released on  2005-02-06 and ships udev 050.
Slackware-current (the unstable/development branch) is currently using udev 054.
Both the udev 050 and udev 054 Slackware packages should install fine
on a Slackware 10.0 box as far as I can see. So people just need to
upgrade their distro, or at least the udev bit of it :)
I'm running Slackware-current here with udev 054 and everything is just fine.
