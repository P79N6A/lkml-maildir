We call into the driver with the lock held for the sake of consistency.  
When you get right down to it, you can write a driver who has no more 
concept of SMP locking than spin_lock_irq(host->host_lock); in the isr 
routine.  They need to know to drop the lock before calling scsi_sleep() 
in the eh routines, or they can drop the lock and sleep on some wait queue 
as well if they wish.  But, in general, in depth locking knowledge is not 
required.  Since I've ported the old aic7xxx driver to the new scheme, it 
is for certain an improvement over the old method in terms of ease of 
programming a driver to the API.

Right, both already handled.

It saves a lot of code duplication.  There's basically only two existing 
reset strategies around.  A) I'm a stupid card with a SCSI bus and all 
SCSI busses and plain SCSI devices hang pretty much the same way, so the 
mid layer can write a reasonable strategy routine and just have the low 
level driver fill in the implementation hooks (abort hook, bus reset hook, 
full host reset hook, etc) and B) I'm an intelligent firmware and you just 
let me do my thing, in which case the mid layer can't really do anything 
and the low level drivers only need to leave the hooks undefined because 
if the firmware looses the command we're bust already.

Lower levels on smart cards assume that if the card ever looses a command 
then you just want a watchdog to reset the machine anyway.
