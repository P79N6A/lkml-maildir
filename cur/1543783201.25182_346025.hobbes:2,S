Yes, it can.  Several people on the SYSLINUX mailing list have tried 
this, and it works just fine.  The current version of SYSLINUX has a 
limit of 511 characters (because of memory management reasons inside 
SYSLINUX) instead of 255 (plus null).
I think someone on the SYSLINUX mailing list already sent a patch to 
akpm to make 512 the default; making it configurable would be a better 
idea.  Feel free to send your patch through me.
