I agree this is strange...

I looked into freebsd sources and there is not this resetting there.
They have the whole rusage structure in task structure and they leave
it untouched during the exec.
I agree with you that it would make more sense to remember rss hiwater
after exec. It's even logical from the userspace point of view. However
in the taskstats code the rss hiwater value is taken directly by
get_mm_hiwater_rss() macro which gets the value from new mm. I think
the behavior of this and behavior of this patch should be the same (and
in current version of the patch it is).

The improvement is minimal.

I'm not sure I understand this correctly. Shouldn't here be max() instead of +() ?

But it might happen that mm struct is gone when k_getrusage is called
and then we need signal->maxrss value.
