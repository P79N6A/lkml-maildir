Right here I see a problem. You aren't really multi-level if you
have the notion of a "current" security level. You only have the

What I mean by "checkbox" is that some manager has a checklist
of OS features that they are supposed to get. Trusted Solaris
gets a checkmark for supporting CMW operation, even though it
doesn't work in a sane manner -- just like Windows NT gets a
checkmark for supporting POSIX. The checkmark doesn't mean that
the feature is actually well thought out and usable.

The stack idea needs to be eliminated. It isn't even enough to
prevent spoofing, since I could draw a fake stack. Heh... the
stack almost makes spoofing EASY. In any case, the stack is
a useless waste of space that makes GUI operation difficult.

Both methods are secure. They are in fact redundant with the taskbar.
This can be a site-specific option, at least until it is determined
that one method is less confusing than the other.

Yes, of course. What I meant above is that a user authorized for
levels 2..6 on a system with 4..8 should log in at 4..6, not just
the single level 4. (but one may choose fewer levels than allowed)
You could have a "Start" button whose root menu offers a choice
of security level, so that all levels are ready to use.

No, this can be done correctly. It is just difficult.
You can do the whole Trusted Network thing, with Trusted Routers
and MAC data in your IP packets. Maybe VLANs would help. You can
identify a Trusted Host by shared secret or huge public keys.
With dummy traffic to stop covert channels, you could even do a
Trusted VPN over the public Internet.
The above gets you two Trusted systems talking to each other.
You now need a way to deal with the tty. Well, that has a
security level associated with it. You use a Trusted multi-level
ssh client and server that understand how to manage the pty and
tag traffic going across the link.
The only thing left is dealing with the xterm. There are two ways
to handle this I think, both of which require a multi-level xterm.
Method one changes the pty level. Method two uses a separate pty for
each level -- I suppose /dev/pts would be a multi-level directory.
(and of course the xterm, knowing about X, can tell the X server
to adjust the security level of the window)

No problem with Trusted Xterm!
Xterm must change level in response to the new pty level.
Going from high level to low level clears the scroll back,
unless you want to get into individually tagged characters.
