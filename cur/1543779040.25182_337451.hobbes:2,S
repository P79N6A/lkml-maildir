I believe the definition of extInt is that it is an external
interrupt controller that sends interrupts like an 8259.
So it might be possible but it would be an extreme hardware.
And it would be an old hardware configuration because acpi
doesn't even allow you to setup that kind of thing.

Good question the assumption was already in the code, but
it isn't hard to lift.

Probably.  It has to come before the call to clear_IO_APIC().
I was just be extra careful about that.

The reason I generated the patch is because reading the acpi
tables is the default no one is even using the MP table anymore.
The acpi MADT table can't represent the notion of an a pin
in ExtInt mode.  Even in the MP table has the information is pretty
much advisory as the OS doesn't use it except on very old systems.
The practical question is which is the better route.  Save
off all of the entries in the apic and ioapic and restore
them on reboot, or simply save off which pin the i8259 is
talking through and restore one pin in ExtInt mode.  I like
the latter because we have enough information that we can
and if there is a weird system we can specify it with a command
line parameter.  But the save/restore approach may be more general,
and less prone to coder error.
