Well, the group is certainly not busy. I will go with invalid as it is
definitly an  invalid value when the groups have rt tasks. But if someone
disagrees, I have no issue with it being something else.

This patch checks if we can set the rt_runtime_us to 0. If there is a
realtime task in the group, we don't want to set the rt_runtime_us as 0
or bad things will happen.
