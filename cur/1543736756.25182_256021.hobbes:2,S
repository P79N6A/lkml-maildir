The problem seems to be in qlogic isp1020 driver, not in the RAID code.
I've seen exactly the same oops report, but that had happened while
writing to SCSI tape.

It's the line 1052 in drivers/scsi/qlogicisp.c:
		if (sts->hdr.entry_type == ENTRY_STATUS)
			Cmnd->result = isp1020_return_status(sts);
The "Cmnd" pointer happened to be a NULL somehow...
