I am curious about this. 
This patch has been proposed since almost a month or more now, and
clearly nobody seems to care about this, since it didn't make it in the
2.6.0-test11 tarball (don't know about more recent bk trees though) nor
do the debian glibc maintainer judge the issue important enough to act
on it (despite it breaking buildage of other packages).
So, is there a reason why not to solve this problem this way, or a
particular reason why __invalid_size_argument_for_IOC is still int and
not unsigned int ?
Friendly,
Sven Luther
