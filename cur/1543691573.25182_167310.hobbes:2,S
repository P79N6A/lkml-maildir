Basically there is appears to be threading bug on K 2.6.  The source
attached to the above bug runs correctly on K2.4 and also on many other
platforms.  The source also works correctly if I use the define that
forks instead of threads. It is unlikely that there is a problem with
this code, it is fairly simple.
Could a specialist please look at this problem.  I am using gcc 3.3.2 to
compile both kernel and source.
