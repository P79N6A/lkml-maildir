What is the value of preempt_thresh? If it's set then it overrides the
preempt_max_latency value. (previously the bogus timing values probably
triggered even a relatively high preempt-threshold, but now with a
correct tracer it's not possible anymore.)

yeah, this was deliberate - it's a side-effect of separating it from the
other timing options.
