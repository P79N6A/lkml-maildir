Besides the tasklist_lock issues, there is no 1:1 relationship between
sockets and processes, which is why this can never work. You don't know
which process is going to receive a packet until it calls recvmsg().
There is some work in progress to solve this problem in a different way,
by adding new hooks to the protocols that get the socket as context,
and using SElinux labels instead of process names/inodes/whatever for
matching.
