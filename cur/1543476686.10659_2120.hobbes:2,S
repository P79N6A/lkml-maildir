Hi all,
	I'm trying to make high-performance & low cost X terminals from PC
hardware.  These will be closely spaced, so multiple X terms on a single
motherboard is fine.  Recent MB's have 2 ps/2 ports & 2 nine-pin serial; I
checked and the ps/2 aux driver appears to be in the same source file as
the pc keyboard driver...  Since multi-head X is already possible with,
for instance, some Matrox video cards, has anyone been able to attach 2
kb + 2 mice and service 2 users?
	I mean hell, this _is_ Linux...
