The list is set up.

You can subscribe by sending a message to majordomo@nl.linux.org
with a body of "subscribe kernel-doc".

Besides, vger is just too busy and has a little bit too
much lag for my tastes. We need a second server anyway
(and someone to set up a web page with pointers to all
lists).

I don't have much time to do the advertizing :(
Could somebody else take care of that? (and lead
the newbies out of linux-kernel so that the gurus
can proceed with the debugging)
Btw: any hacker with wet kernel dreams can send
their stuff to <linux-future@nl.linux.org>, another
list created to let hackers ventilate their brain
without suffocating the linux-kernel crowd...
