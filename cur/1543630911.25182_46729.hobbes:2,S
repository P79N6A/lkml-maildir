Calm down casdcsdc! :) Look at the docs (and grep the sources ;) )... it seems
it is now supported by the tulip driver, see:
drivers/net/tulip/ChangeLog
drivers/net/tulip/dmfe.c
From Documentation/networking/dmfe.txt
        A Davicom DM9102(A)/DM9132/DM9801 fast ethernet driver for Linux.
Suggestion to tulip maintainer: if this is the case, make a note in
Documentation/networking/dmfe.txt, that is still in the kernel, but beware,
the 2.5 tree I'm using is not the latest...
