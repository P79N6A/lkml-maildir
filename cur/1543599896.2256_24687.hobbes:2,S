So you're saying it's a bug that I can't work around?
It's probably a moot point.  I've come up with a different algorithm 
that allocates all but 32MB of RAM, and it appears to work well.
I heard that 2.4.9 doesn't even run "thrash".  Is this true?  If so, why 
are these buggy VM's being released in the first place?
