Subject: [PATCH] sata_nv: don't use legacy DMA in ADMA mode (v2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/22/147

We need to run any DMA command with result taskfile requested in ADMA mode
when the port is in ADMA mode, otherwise it may try to use the legacy DMA engine
in ADMA mode which is not allowed. Enforce this with BUG_ON() since data
corruption could potentially result if this happened. Also WARN_ON() if we try
and send result taskfile commands while NCQ commands are still active, since the
hardware doesn't allow this.
