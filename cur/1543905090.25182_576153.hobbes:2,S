you are probably right... I removed one of the RAMs, no crash
anymore. This is not ... nice. The manual says, that the board can
handle up to 1GB (2x512MB). I don't think the RAM itself is damaged --
these are brandnew Kingston "ValueRam" PC133 SD-RAMs with lifelong 
guarantee. I wonder if this behaviour only apperas with my particular
board, or if all VIA EPIA Mini ITX 500 are affected (I've run out
of boards to test ...)
thanks,
