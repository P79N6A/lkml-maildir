Patrick,
	Here's shm to sysfs rebuild following your advices :
	Summary :
		-Removing kobj_map 
		-Adding object memsetting rather than field/field NULL 
		-Declaring attributes global 
		-Adding pointer compare rather than string compare 
		-Removing unnecessary pressure on the stack 
		-Using kobj_type 
		-shm destruction moved to kobject release function 
		-id seek was trivial.Attrshow rewritten. 
		-Tested against recursive fgreps-kde-personal benchmark
program 
		-Removed might_sleep warning (shm_unlock was global lock to
kobject_registration (fs 		node lock) 
		-Checking release code in front of all shm_destroy calls.
