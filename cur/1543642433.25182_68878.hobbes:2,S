You're right, all updates were already included in the 2.4.19
kernel. The only thing extra in your tarball is the 2.2 compat
code and two copy_to_user() return code fixes in cs4281_ioctl().
I wonder if it's some strange bug with the CS4281 hardware in
this Toshiba laptop:
00:08.0 Multimedia audio controller: Cirrus Logic Crystal CS4281 PCI Audio (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Toshiba America Info Systems: Unknown device ff00
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 5
        Memory at fc010000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
        Memory at fc000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]
Does this ring a bell (pun intended) ?
regards,
Rik
