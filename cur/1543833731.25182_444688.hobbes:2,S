But it does issue writes in parallel.  The problem is in the way RAID1
works.  When you do a read from the RAID1, it issues one read request
to one of the underlying disks.  When you do a write, it issues one write
request to _each_ of the underlying disks.  So with two disks in the
mirror set, every write issued by your program causes two disk writes.
