Can someone explain what a "GPL-compatible" license is? Not to
open old sores, but I should be able to provide a license
that states;
 "Anybody can use this text for any purpose whatsoever as long
  as they keep my name within."
However, It has been recently stated that this is not "GPL
compatible",  that you must refer to the exact version of the
"GPL" license to have something "GPL" compatible. This will
prevent a lot of good software from being included within the
kernel, in addition to Linus's software if taken seriously.
Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
