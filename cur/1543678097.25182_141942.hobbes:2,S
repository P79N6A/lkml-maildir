It was me who added this crappy quirk.
My ELine modem which identified itself "Rockwell 56K ACF II Fax+Data+Voice Modem"
was going mad when its IRQ was shared with any device. So I decided to add this
quirk.
Personally I think that ISA IRQ sharing should be absolutely last resort technic,
because ISA bus was never designed to support IRQ sharing sanely. If you have to
enable ISA PnP device and do not have enough IRQ, you must print BIG FAT WARNING
before doing this. May be kernel config options must be added for brave guys
wanting to use ISA IRQ sharing.
