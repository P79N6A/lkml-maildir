Hi!
The Umbrella project (umbrella.sf.net) also needs the ability to use
public key cryptography within the Linux kernel (though only to verify
signatures).
We were planing to implement RSA or ElGamal (porting some of GPG) to the
kernel for that purpose. However, if this project gets started, we will
be very interested. In the automn we might also have some development
hours to contribute with :-)
Cheers, KS.
