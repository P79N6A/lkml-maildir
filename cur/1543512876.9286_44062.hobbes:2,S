current->counter means _nothing_. You can set the current->counter to zero
and _nothing_ will happens returning from sched_yield(). The only thing
which matter is current->need_resched.

No. Even if CPU1 is idle the task can be _not_ rescheduled on the idle
CPU1. _You_ should read reschedule_idle(). It's what I tring to tell you
since 2/3 email ago.
Precisely you are completly missing this line:
	if (target_tsk && p->avg_slice > cacheflush_time)
		goto send_now;
Also even if the above wouldn't be implemented it's really bad to depend
on a precise reschedule_idle behaviour that may vary over the time and
it's orthogonal with the other code as far as it's safe and provides the
necessary semantics to wake tasks corrrectly.
