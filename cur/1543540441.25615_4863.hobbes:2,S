With reiserfs, zero. (well, zero additional risk).
I wwould guess even with ext2 you get zero additional risk: unless your
machine dies there is no corruption at all. If it dies it might get corrupted
independent of when the last write access was.
Programs relying on safe storage (e.g. MTAs) generally sync their files
(as is required by SMTP for example), and this forces a write.

Then you have to spin up every xx seconds OR get rid of atime at least for
most directories.
Hopefully, reiserfs will provide selective noatime,nodiratime,sync flags
soon.
