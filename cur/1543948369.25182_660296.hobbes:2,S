How about adding something like..
== 
CONFIG_SIMULTANEOUS_PAGE_RECLAIMERS 
int
default 3
depends on DEBUG
help
  This value determines the number of threads which can do page reclaim
  in a zone simultaneously. If this is too big, performance under heavy memory
  pressure will decrease.
  If unsure, use default.

Then, you can get performance reports from people interested in this
feature in test cycle.
