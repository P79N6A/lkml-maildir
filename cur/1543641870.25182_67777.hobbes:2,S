For the major new changes in ext3, I think I'll end up bringing back a
lot of the 2.5 changes into a 2.4 branch.  Beyond a certain point,
though, I'll probably have to start basing new ext3 work on 2.5 ---
the BKL mitigation, in particular, is going to depend on the locking
regime which is substantially different in 2.5.  
My current codebase should help BKL in both 2.4 and 2.5 simply because
it substantially reduces the amount of work we're doing in the core,
without actually changing the locking, but eliminating BKL entirely in
larger chunks of the code will have to be the next stage.
