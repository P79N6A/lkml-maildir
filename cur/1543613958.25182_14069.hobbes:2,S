Your patch does not appear to relate to iproute-20010824. I think I've found
the problem, however. I think there has been an API change between 2.2 and
2.4. 'ip' compiled under 2.2 will not properly configure ECMP on 2.4!
If I recompile tc under 2.4, the problem disappears.
Maybe ip should warn against this? Should be easy to do.
