What does the large square represent here? A "largepage"? If yes,
which order? There seem to be quite some pixels in each square...

If the largepage is the square, there can't be red pixels mixed with
green pixels with the config-page-shift design, this is the whole
difference...
zooming in I see red pixels all over the squares mized with green
pixels in the same square. This is exactly what happens with the
variable order page cache and that's why it provides zero guarantees
in terms of how much ram is really "free" (free as in "available").

If I understood correctly, here you agree that mixing movable and
unmovable objects in the same largepage is a bad thing, and that's
incidentally what config-page-shift prevents. It avoids it instead of
undoing the mixture later with defrag when it's far too late for
anything but updatedb.

With config-page-shift mmap works on 4k chunks but it's always backed
by 64k or any other largesize that you choosed at compile time. And if
the virtual alignment of mmap matches the physical alignment of the
physical largepage and is >= PAGE_SIZE (software PAGE_SIZE I mean) we
could use the 62nd bit of the pte to use a 64k tlb (if future cpus
will allow that). Nick also suggested to still set all ptes equal to
make life easier for the tlb miss microcode.

Yep, exactly this is what happens, it avoids that trouble. But as far
as fragmentation guarantees goes, it's really about keeping the
unmovable out of our way (instead of spreading the unmovable all over
the buddy randomly, or with ugly
boot-time-fixed-numbers-memory-reservations) than to map largepages in
userland. Infact as I said we could map kmalloced 4k entries in
userland to save memory if we would really want to hurt the fast paths
to make a generic kernel to use on smaller systems, but that would be
very complex. Since those 4k entries would be 100% movable (not like
the rest of the slab, like dentries and inodes etc..) that wouldn't
make the design less reliable, it'd still be 100% reliable and
performance would be ok because that memory is userland memory, we've
to set the pte anyway, regardless if it's a 4k page or a largepage.

Sure! 2M is sure way excessive for a 1G system, 64k most certainly
too, of course unless you're running a db or a multimedia streaming
service, in which case it should be ideal.
