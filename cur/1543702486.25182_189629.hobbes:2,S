It shouldn't be _that_ bad.
removable media devices usually tell you that they are removable media
devices (scsi: inquiry data has a bit for that IIRC).  If you pass
this up to hotplug it can use that to figure whenever it has a hard
disk (=> just create the existing partitions) or a removable device
(=> create a few more nodes to catch the usual removable media
layouts).
I also think you don't need *all* minors for removable media.  I
havn't seen removable media with extended partitions so far.  IIRC zip
floppys are using /dev/sda4 and most other ones either /dev/sda1 or
/dev/sda directly, so we likely can catch 99% with just three device
nodes.
