I had similar deadlocks

I was able to trigger this bug rather easy (tested with 2.4.4-ac3,
ac5, ac6 and with 2.4.5) or not at all (2.4.3-ac3, perhaps also
with 2.4.5 with 8139too.c from 2.4.3-ac3):
trying to upload 5-10 Mb (transfer speed was about 500Kb/s) almost
surely frozed system.
When I tried 2.4.5 with drivers/net/8139too.c from 2.4.3-ac3 I uploaded
some tenths of Mb and downloaded more than 100Mb without deadlocks
