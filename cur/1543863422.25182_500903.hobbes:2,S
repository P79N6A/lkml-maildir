1) why these tunables?
The ipc tunables have been selected as "guinea-pig" tunables for the AKT 
framework because they are likely to be often used in data bases. This 
applies to file-max too.
Now, if the framework itself is accepted, the set of impacted tunables 
can easily be enhanced.
2) why autotuning:
There are at least 3 cases where it can be useful
. for workloads that are known to need a big amount of a given resource 
type (say shared memories), but we don't know what the maximum amount 
needed will be
. to solve the case of multiple applications running on a single system, 
and that need the same tunable to be adjusted to feet their needs
. to make a system correctly react to eventual peak loads for a given 
resource usage, i.e. make it tune up *and down* as needed.
In all these cases, the akt framework will enable the kernel to adapt to 
increasing / decreasing resource consumption:
1) avoid allocating "a priori" a big amount of memory that will be used 
only in extreme cases. This is the effect of doing an "echo <huge_value> 
 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmni"
2) the system will come back to the default values as soon as the peak 
load is over.

We wanted to make it configurable because it adds some overhead in terms of
1) generated kernel size
2) instructions added to the resource creation / removal code paths even 
if auto-tuning is not activated for th corresponding tunable -> 
performance impact.

Yes, agree with you: the idea here was to make the framework more 
generic. But I can change that.
