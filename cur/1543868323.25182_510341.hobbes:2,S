This structure, with its unsigned longs and pointers, is going to
create enormous headaches for 32-bit processes on 64-bit machines as
far as I can see---and on ppc64 machines, almost all processes are
32-bit, since there is no inherent speed penalty for running in 32-bit
mode, and some space savings.
Have you thought about how you will handle compatibility for 32-bit
processes?  The issue will arise for x86_64 and ia64 (among others)
too, I would think.
Paul.
