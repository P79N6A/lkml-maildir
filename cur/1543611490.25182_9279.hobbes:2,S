The reason I ask is VIA have had a history of weird ISA DMA hangs when doing
certain other operations. It could be some combination of these triggering
problems.

Are you seeing the hangs in X11, and which X setup (one with agp loaded ?)
Also does it print "Activiating ISA DMA workarounds" during the boot ?
