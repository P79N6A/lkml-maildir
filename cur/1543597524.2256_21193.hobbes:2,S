Huh, Very Cool.  I was getting ready to queue up a huge IRDA forward port in 
linux-vr to the 2.4.6 version.  (Still el-crashola on me right now)  The one 
in the present repository likes to overwrite userspace applications pretty 
much at randomn.
Maybe after things simmer down I'll port the Agenda hardware platform over to 
your repository, and Agenda can switch to using that.  linux-vr has been 
really really stale since we froze at our present version for toolchain 
reasons.  Those toolchain problems were fixed ages ago, but Mike & Brad who 
had been responsible for forward porting the kernel stopped doing that work 
for the most part.
Thanks,
Shane Nay.
