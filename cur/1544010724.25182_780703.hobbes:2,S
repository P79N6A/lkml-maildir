I don't think so. The usage model of the cyclecounter is that the
hardware is owned by someone who initializes and controls it, including
enable/disable. The abstract API with the read method is just there so
that common utility code can access the hardware in a uniform way.
For example, the igb driver owns and uses the NIC time register.
Disabling the NIC timer should be done together with disabling the NIC.
This is different from traditional clocksources which are independent
and controlled by the timing subsystem.

It has 64 bit registers, so there is indeed no wrapping issue.

Thanks, will add that.
Can you (or someone else) also look at clocksync.[ch]? David wanted to
have that independently reviewed, too, before including it in
netdev-next.
