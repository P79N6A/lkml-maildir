Sorry for the lack of info:
Errors happen during: 
make bzImage 
will add the error file bzI_err
the architecture is for i686
this happen also with phoebe kernel-2.4.20-2.48, i had this problem a few
days ago, so i upgraded gcc, cpp, glibc, rpm to the latest rawhide rpms 
15.2.03, but get the same error 'make No rule to make target '2''
