I reported this one here over a week ago, and upon a suggestion from 'benh', 
i came up with a workaround patch for this bug, now documented in Bugzilla:
	
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1426
Attached below is said workaround patch which works for me.  I don't like 
it as i don't think platform-specific code belongs in 'drivers/scsi/sd.c'.
Hence i'm not necessarily recommending this for 2.6.0 unless important
people think otherwise.  It does seem to make the problem go away and
eventually, 'benh' will fix this one properly.
