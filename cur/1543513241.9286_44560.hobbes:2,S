ide-scsi seems to find only the second cdrom drive on an ide chain. It 
does work properly under 2.2.12.
details:
on my seconday ide chain I have
1 cdr - master  -> MATSHITA CD-R CW-7582, ATAPI CDROM drive
1 cdrom - slave -> CD-ROM 40X/AKU, ATAPI CDROM drive
under 2.2.12 if I do a >$ modprobe ide-scsi, it finds both. Under
2.2.13pre17 it only finds the second on (even if I switch
master/slave)
I have this problem when I compile with gcc 2.7.2.2 as well as gcc
2.95.1
