I got it to freeze in console (two generic find / -type f / type d), one
process allocating and writing 0 to 192mb
machine responds to pings, switching VTs works
(256 physical, 512 swap)
Mem-info
Free pages: 1524kB (0kB High)
( Active: 39586, inactive_dirty: 18590, inactive_clean: 0, free: 381 (383
766 1149) )
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 = 508kB
2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 = 1016kB
Swap cache: add 152715, delete 98195, find 775/1918
Free swap:	307720kB
65520 pages of RAM
0 pages of HIGHMEM
1595 reserved pages
1146 pages shared
54520 pages swap cached
0 pages in page table cache
Buffer memory:	12444kB
find x/y seemed to be increasing y very slowly (5 minutes ago was at 1916,
free was at 380 I think)
