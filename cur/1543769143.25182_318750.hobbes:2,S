Nice.

There's another problem with it: we don't hold a reference to
old_nd.mnt->mnt_namespace, and the namespace going away could race
with this function.
So first obtain the necessary reference:
	spin_lock(&vfsmount_lock);
	ns2 = old_nd.mnt->mnt_namespace;
	if (ns2)
		get_namespace(ns2);
	spin_unlock(&vfsmount_lock);
Then take the semaphores.
Then recheck old_nd.mnt->mnt_namespace, because it might have been
detached between the spin_unlock() and the down_write(&ns2->sem).
It's starting to get a bit complex, and I'm wondering if it's worth it :)
