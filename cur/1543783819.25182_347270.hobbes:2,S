If the hardware manufacturer won't give you the spec's then writing a driver
is going to be pretty difficult, if not impossible. Reverse-engineering 
may be possible, but still....
I believe it's the lack of spec's, rather than the existence of ndiswrapper
and driverloader, that hinder driver development.
