	I saw a similar thing a few weeks ago (under 2.5.27?) with the
Hewlett-Packard 656C ink jet printer, which only occurred when I would
send a page with images on it, so the printer really would need a long
time before it was ready to accept more data.
	I would hope that the kernel should be able to wait as long
as the printer wants before the printer indicates that it is ready for
more data.  I don't know if this is a bug in these printers' USB
implementations or if it is a real kernel bug.  I just haven't had
time to investigate it yet (and I no longer have access to that printer,
although 656C's are only $30 at Fry's).
