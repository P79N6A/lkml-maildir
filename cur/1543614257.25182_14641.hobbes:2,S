the ide cable is the one that came with the mainboard, it worked perfectly
for one year with the 20gb hd. and yes, i'm using the via-driver.
the strange thing about this is that it all worked perfectly before i added
the 80gb disk. and it corrupts files only on that disk.
anyway, i've recompiled 2.4.17 from a fresh source tree. until now, i
haven't discovered any corrupted files of whoch i _know_ that they have to
be corrupted since i used this kernel. so probably this was a problem of the
preemption patch and reiserfs and large disks and via chipsets, but i'm not
100% sure about this. the changelog for 2.4.17 mentioned some reiserfs
fixes; are any of those related to corrupted files?
