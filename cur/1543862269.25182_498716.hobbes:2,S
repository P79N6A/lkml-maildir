And when turning off read-ahead, the speed dropped to 30 MB/sec.  Read-ahead
should not help here, I think... But after analyzing the "randomness" a bit,
it turned out alot of requests are coming to places "near" the ones which has
been read recently.  After switching to another random number generator,
speed in a case WITH readahead enabled dropped to almost 5Mb/sec ;)
And sure thing, withOUT O_DIRECT, the whole system is almost dead under this
load - because everything is thrown away from the cache, even caches of /bin
/usr/bin etc... ;)  (For that, fadvise() seems to help a bit, but not alot).
(No, really - this load isn't entirely synthetic.  It's a typical database
workload - random I/O all over, on a large file.  If it can, it combines
several I/Os into one, by requesting more than a single block at a time,
but overall it is random.)
