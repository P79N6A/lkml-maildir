Ah, do be careful with 'fairness' here. The single RQ is fair wrt cpu
time, just not quite as 'fair' wrt to latency.

All I can say it that its trivial to reproduce these horrid latencies.
As for Ingo's setup, the worst that he does is run distcc with (32?)
instances on that machine - and I assume he has that user niced waay
down.

Again, be careful with the fairness issue. CPU time should still be
fair, but yes, other groups might experience some latencies.
