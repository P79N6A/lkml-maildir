lol.  git-watchdog changes these to
#define DRV_VERSION     "1.10"
#define DRV_RELDATE     "17-Aug-2007"
Version numbers and dates like this really are pretty pointless.  If you
get a report against "v1.10", it just is not useful information.  You still
need to ask "what kernel version" to be able to reliably locate the source
for the reporter's driver.
But it's a great way to generate .rej files.
