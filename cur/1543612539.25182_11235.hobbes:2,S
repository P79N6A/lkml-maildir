Thanks for this hint, but it is not all that easy. Problem is the definition is
needed for _all_ files in the hisax-subtree, to be more precise for all
currently including hisax.h. I am not very fond of the idea to add additional
conditions to the availability of the HISAX_MAX_CARDS symbol, especially if
they are located in the Makefile. 
Anyway, how would you generate this additional -D for all files inside a
certain directory? Obviously the stuff should at least be put inside the
hisax-Makefile, and not one layer above in isdn-Makefile.
I tried "CFLAGS += ..." but that does not work.
Thanks for help,
Stephan
