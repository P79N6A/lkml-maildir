Interesting you mention it: I'm "supporting" several equally skilled 
family members' computers, half of them running Windows (XP Prof, ME,
98SE - you pick the flavour) half of them running Debian testing, guess
which call more often? Oh yes, and if they call: The Linux people call
in advance *before* making decisions (like buying new hardware) while
the Windows people only call me to clean up the messed system...
