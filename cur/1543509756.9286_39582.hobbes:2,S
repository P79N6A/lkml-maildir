Right...I kinda had that scenario in the back of my mind...

Yeah, this does sound horrid.

The original problem is an IPSec processing module which links a
virtual device to a physical device, receiving packets on the virtual
device (one for each potential physical device that may be used to
carry IPSec'ed traffic), IPSec processing it, then stuffing it out the
physical device.  This approach is going away soon in our 2.2.xx , so
unless it is a relatively simple check or notification, it is not
worth spending lots of time on it.
Thanks for your response.
