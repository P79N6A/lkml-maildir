I think EBADF implies that you opened the thing not for writing, and now
you are trying to write to it.
But my understanding of this problem is that the open is succeeding for
writes, but when the actual write is performed, the store fails (or does
not exist).
EIO makes sense for that.  EACCESS less so, but still some.
