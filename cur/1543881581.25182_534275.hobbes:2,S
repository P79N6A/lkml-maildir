Indeed. The vast majority of people doing "LAMP" web services are
doing it on a single machine. Or VM for that matter.
It seems that this is a lot like the priority inheritance problem. If
a nice -19 process blocks on the db running at nice 0, the db ought to
get a boost until it wakes the original process up. The same should
apply at the level of dynamic priorities at the same nice level.
