Subject: [PATCH 00/11] unpaged: PageReserved VM fixups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here come my fixups to the PageReserved removal in 2.6.15-rc1.
Diffed against 2.6.15-rc1-git5.  I hope they can be included in
2.6.15-rc2, but admit they've had had no real driver testing yet.
Please scrutinize and test!
Hugh
