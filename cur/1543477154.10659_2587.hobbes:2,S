Not really; the counters are there so that A is allowed to disable it
_at the same time_ as B.  The race condition is: disabled already due to
B.  B calls enable_bh().  A calls disable_bh().  The bottom half ends up
enabled.
My dreamy self thinks that incrementing before clearing the bit in
disable_bh(), instead of after, should fix this, but someone wider-eyed
should have a think about it.
