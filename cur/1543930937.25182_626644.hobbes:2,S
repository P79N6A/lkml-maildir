4 isn't sensible. There have been machines capable both of running Linux and 
their ISA bus at less than 8 MHz (if only for example by picking a 5 divisor 
on a system that was capable of hosting a 40 Mhz 386/486 but using a slower 
CPU) but not by much. And machines doing that and running Linux, even more 
so "today": 0.
My posted test program (although there seems to be something wrong with it 
since it's influenced by compiler optimisation) is showing more than 1 but 
note that on the vast majority of machines, 0 would in fact do. 1 will on 
all, 2 will as well.
