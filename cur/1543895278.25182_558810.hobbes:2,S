Sorry for my English. Requesting test cases from the developers of
course. Or at least results of some kind of testing, so people may run
and check them as well, if something is suspected. And this from my POV
leads again to organized way of filtering noise and collecting structured
information easily (yea, i think it's BTS with reportbug in Debian).{0}

I think, positive feedback from {0} to the LTP may improve that.
Especially, if things are in parts and easy to choose for testing.

That two are _exactly_ what reportbug tool is doing. That's why i'm
talking about it. And i'm *no* wonder why developers are boring -- at
some points they might not handle the *noise*.

Bits for Adrian.
*ML*
I *use* Gmane. I'm not subscribed (receiving e-mail to my mbox) to any ML,
except <kbuild@sf.net>.
Nearly every my e-mail here is with Gmane links. You seem ignored all of
them. As for me it's result of *your personal*, rather than technical
activity.
*offense*
I'm not talking about personal offense, you are seem thinking about, but
technical one. I.e. when possible benefit might be even more, than NOHZ
on x86 and a like[0], with much less effort. I still think, unless i will
develop or fail, that reducing traffic on one or two order of magnitude
is possible as well as improving kbuild/kconfig to reduce of the noise of
mis-configurations/tester's .config length. Discouraging that effort is
my source of offense.
(FYI Until Linus checked in my _RFT_ kbuild patches, i realized how
*many* people are willing to understand and try to test kbuild stuff.)
[0] I bet VGA, DRAM, HDD are far more power hungry room-heaters. Unless
    you can substantially lower frequency, you might have no benefit at
    all. Whana know how it's done in perfectly designed embedded
    MCU/CPU? Please, see for instance MSP430 from TI (i know, it uses
    SRAM, but i've asked to look on processor core design).
