Yikes something isn't right with these backtraces that page_owner is
showing. Even without frame pointers it shouldn't be this noisy.
I'm afraid I'm going to need to ask for more help, could you please
select CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER under 
Kernel hacking => "Compile the kernel with frame pointers"
And when that kernel is booted, could you directly send me the output
of /proc/page_owner (sort or unsorted) so that I can see if something is
wrong with the data it's producing (just to be sure).
If it works better with CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER, i'm also going to have to
ask you to do another one of these runs that you just did.
Thanks
Alexander
