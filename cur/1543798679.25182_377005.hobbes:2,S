I don't think separate fs/files makes sense with pthreads.
Why? Signals.
Signals are shared in a pthread environment, so signal handlers can happen 
in any thread. If you don't share the filesystem thing, your signal 
handlers had better not do any file operations. You'd better not try to 
use the old "send a byte down a pipe" trick to wake somebody else up, 
because the thread you may take the signal in may not _have_ that pipe fd 
open.
Now, opening files in a signal handler may be unusual enough that 
having separate cwd/root (!CLONE_FS as opposed to !CLONE_FILES) might be 
more commonly usable, but it's still potentially asking for some really 
funky behaviour.
