There is nothing to fix, we already use a tempfile + rename, it's in KSaveFile 
since 1999. Or just look with strace if you don't believe me. This Tim 
Connors guy shouldn't talk about things he obviously knows nothing about.
As far as I can see the problem is that the filesystem writes out the meta 
data before the actual file data hits the disk which creates a period of time 
in which the on-disk state of the filesystem contains trashed files. I 
believe ReiserFS actually has an option to do things in a sane order so that 
it doesn't trash recently used files on an unclean shutdown.
The sentiment among filesystem developers seem to be that they don't care if 
they trash files as long as the filesystem itself remains in a consistent 
state. This kind of dataloss is the result of that attitude, either go 
complain with them if it bothers you, or use a filesystem that does it right.
Cheers,
Waldo
