I think the more important questions are:
  - Are there people who know how to get reports to developers?
    (We can't train all potential reporters to get reports right.)
  - Are there enough developers to work towards bug fixes?
The technical means to capture reports, let alone the bugtracking tools,
are of secondary importance.
