As long as the module is in use, it will stay in RAM. Linux doesn't
swap/page/whatever anything in the kernel (and modules are part of the
kernel). The Hackers That Be decreed that the (enormous) extra complexity
buys too litle to be worth it.

You'd probably be transferring data to/from a kmalloc()ed o vmalloc()ed
area, or perhaps even directly to a buffer in userspace, I think. You must
plan on several processes using your driver concurrently, so you can't rely
on local variables.

You should take a look at Rubini's "Linux Device Drivers". It is quite
dated (it concentrates on 2.0, mostly), but gives a good overview. A
edition for 2.4 (and beyond? ;) is in the works, just don't hold your
breath. Coriolis has a series of books on Linux kernel internals, haven't
ever seen one nearby. so I can't say.  Check f.ex. amazon.com for books on
Linux, and read the reviews.
Good luck!
