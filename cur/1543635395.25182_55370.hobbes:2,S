Ehh? Not sure what you're doing here...

You are correct, but re-read what Alan said -- "fsync ensures the data
for that inode/file content is on stable storage". So your fsync(dirfd)
only makes sure data written to the directory is on disk, i.e. the name
of the new file "foo". sync still causes mucho activity because you did
not fsync the outfd.

No, the dummy return of 0 from NFS is not a problem, because directory
updates, and indeed all writes, are supposed to be syncronous by
default. There really is no need to fsync on an NFS directory, as the
name should already be on stable storage by the time open() returns.
At least this is my understanding,
