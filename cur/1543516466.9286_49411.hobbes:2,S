Agree, as long as no file "shadows" another one, etc.

How do you decide where to send writes?

Messy semantics. How about several files with the same name?

OK, but several rw partitions is a mess anyway.

Argh! I suspect that will _not_ work right with the current kernel
internals: The path to a file (as registered via dentries) does _not_
register the user. Note that with your scheme, we both could be using files
with the very same path, but totally different files. This is just calling
for trouble, AFAIKS.
The writable layer _has_ to be one, everybody has to agree on what each
path means.

Yes, but you are trying to fake rw over ro anyway; the most use of this
would be for me to mount the CD from my distribution, and over it mount the
updates (files are gone, new ones appeared, others got changed).

I don't think so. I'd assume this fiddling will take some support from
userland, so better wait until init(8) has gotten the system up. I might be
mistaken.
But having changes show up somehow on the filesystem is the most important
reason for having one in the first place, so getting rid of this feature
doesn't make sense.

Nope. Read-only is aleady possible, read-write has to be possible in a
reaonable way.

I disagree. If you don't know where you are going in the first place, why
start walking. In this case these operations _are_ the whole point of a rw
filesystem.

OK, then _this_ is the core problem that has to be solved. If it is too
hard to solve, then the whole idea got nowhere.
Posibilities are:
- COW to a (the?) rw layer for files: This can be quite costly: If I overwrite
  a few bytes on a large file might take a long time, fill up the rw layer
- rw layer keeps track of deleted files (not doable AFAIK with current
  on-disk filesystems!)
