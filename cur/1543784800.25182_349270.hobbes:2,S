I will try this one on a problematic ASUS board than now runs on 
2.11.11 with sk98lin-8.18.2.2.patch
Applied the patch from #100258 to 2.6.13.1 successfully (some lines 
offset) and recompiled. Will try it tomorrow when I am at the machine.
BTW, is this patch submitted to the Linus or -mm tree already?
Kalin.
