I'm still wondering if it was good to have 2.3.99-pre and
2.4.0-test-pre-whatever-other-tag since that gives a nasty and
difficult-to-handle version numbering. I would have  preferred if Linux
had stuck to 2.3.1xx until the final 2.4.0 series, while it's not my
decisision, this versioning scheme is a horrible mess.
OTOH, I understand that pre-test series are bugfix series, so APIs
should not change, however the test-* mapping admittedly flattens that
VERSION_CODE.
