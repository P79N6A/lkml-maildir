There's more than that, too. The ACPI spec says that the system must be
able to handle complete dynamic reconfiguration of the system during
suspend/resume. Basically an ideal solution would assume that any device
could have been added or removed while the system was asleep, so it must
account for it by initializing the device and allocating system resources.
Granted CPU hotplugging is a different ballpark, but it's the same league.
