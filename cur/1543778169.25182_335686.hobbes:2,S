There are nontrivial problems:
E.g. what should happen if you select option A that depends on (B || C)?
There's one opinion that options should be either select'able _or_ user 
visible.
The current policy in the kernel is not 100% dogmatic regarding this 
issue, but it shouldn't be violated without a good reason.
