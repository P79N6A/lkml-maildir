Hmmm... looks like you're right.  Someone is stepping on ppp->tpkt in between
the time ppp_tty_push called ppp_async_encode and it was done with the packet.
  ppp_tty_flush_output - seems unlikely.  I don't know if its actually SMP
    safe, but you're probably not getting flushes
  ppp_async_release - could be... does this happen perchance when a connection
    is being closed?
  another ppp_tty_push - uh, I really hope ppp->tty_pushing isn't the only
    thing serializing access here.. that doesn't look healthy to me.
