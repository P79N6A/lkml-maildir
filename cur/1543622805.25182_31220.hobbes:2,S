For the pre1-ac1 problems I reported, 2.95.4 (the Debian one),
reisferfs on IDE, no highmem. The tree has been patched ('official 2.4pre/rc
+ ac only) for many versions.
Now reverted to a clean 2.4.18 (full tarball) +pre1 after the disk
hard-locked in the middle patching, requiring a power cycle.  
I'm currently repeating the tests on pre1-ac2, __initial__ indications
are that the problem does NOT happen, so maybe it was the shm.
