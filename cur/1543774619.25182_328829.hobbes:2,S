This is what I get trying to compile 2.6.12.1 for an AMD Sempron processor,
config Generic-x86-64
It's not likely a kernel problem other than keeping people from testing.
I did a make menuconfig from config-2.6.8.11-amd64-generic on debian 
Sarge 3.1
gcc version 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-13)
pls cc me
Thanks,
   Garst
