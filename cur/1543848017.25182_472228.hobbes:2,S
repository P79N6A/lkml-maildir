Subject: [patch 49/67] SPARC64: Fix serious bug in sched_clock() on sparc64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
Unfortunately, sparc64 doesn't have an easy way to do a "64 X 64 -->
128" bit multiply like PowerPC and IA64 do.  We were doing a
"64 X 64 --> 64" bit multiple which causes overflow very quickly with
a 30-bit quotient shift.
So use a quotientshift count of 10 instead of 30, just like x86 and
ARM do.
This also fixes the wrapping of printk timestamp values every ~17
seconds.
