Thanks everyone for your offlist sympathy you sent me with respect to this 
neck problem. 
There is good news and bad news. The bad news is the nature of this problem is 
that it will get a bit worse before it gets better, and it has not peaked 
yet.
The good news is that in order to stay sane I've found ways of optimising my 
computing position and could work for short stints on the rsdl code. So I'll 
be releasing a new version shortly.
