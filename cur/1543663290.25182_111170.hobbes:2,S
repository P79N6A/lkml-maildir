This isn't quite enough:
static int irq_affinity_write_proc (struct file *file, const char *buffer,
					unsigned long count, void *data)
{
	int irq = (long) data, full_count = count, err;
	unsigned long new_value;
	if (!irq_desc[irq].handler->set_affinity)
		return -EIO;
	err = parse_hex_value(buffer, count, &new_value);
	/*
	 * Do not allow disabling IRQs completely - it's a too easy
	 * way to make the system unusable accidentally :-) At least
	 * one online CPU still has to be targeted.
	 */
	if (!(new_value & cpu_online_map))
		return -EINVAL;
	irq_affinity[irq] = new_value;
	irq_desc[irq].handler->set_affinity(irq, new_value);
	return full_count;
}
This is a bitmask and it's being handed directly to set_ioapic_affinity().
Or, at least, it's inconsistent, being &'d with cpu_online_map.
