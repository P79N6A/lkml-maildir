Are you sure that comment still applies? I can't find any reference
to set_fs in the drm code and compat_alloc_user_space() based handlers
do not have the problem.
Otherwise that approach opens up a security hole by giving user access to
kernel memory on all architectures that have separate address spaces for
user and kernel instead of different ranges in the same address space.
Guessing from the implementation of get_fs/set_fs, these would include
m68k, s390{,x}, sparc{,64} and i386 with the 4G/4G mapping, so these
must never build code that relies on working user pointer dereferences
under set_fs(KERNEL_DS).

(void __user *) arg should really be compat_ptr(arg). In theory,
this is only necessary on s390, which does not implement drm,
but we just do it the right way so other people don't copy
the incorrect code.

Same here. Note how compat_ptr also makes that more readable.
More of these are in other parts of the patch.
