Hi!
having switched to 2.6.0-t3 to test some of the new features, I
noticed more framedrops from bttv. sometimes the system feels a little
sluggish, although i expected the opposite.
trying to track down the "problem" I stumbled across this:
jens@maniac:/usr/src/linux$ cat /proc/interrupts

irqs seem not to be distributed between cpus, having one to handle all
(even while building kernel on both cpus (according to gkrell), the
numbers for the second cpu don't change.
i could post any needed information (hopefully). The bootup process
did not show anything raising questions to me.
any hints?
