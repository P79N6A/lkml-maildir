	I get similiar messages (something like "can't locate module
ppp-compress-xx"   I'm at work, so I don't have access to my logfiles at
home)  This is odd because I believe I have every option for ppp enabled
(as modules).  Perhaps the kernel makefile is broken? <shrug>  I'll be
taking a copy of 2.2.12 home (the joys of a corporate T1 and a Zip
drive, I can download even if ppp at home gets broken) and carefully
check the kernel .config
