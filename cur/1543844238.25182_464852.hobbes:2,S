CPUset provides two things:
- a generic process container abstraction
- "resource controllers" for CPU masks and memory nodes.
Rather than adding a new process container abstraction, wouldn't it
make more sense to change cpuset to make it more extensible (more
separation between resource controllers), possibly rename it to
"containers", and let the various resource controllers fight it out
(e.g. zone/node-based memory controller vs multiple LRU controller,
CPU masks vs a properly QoS-based CPU scheduler, etc)
Or more specifically, what would need to be added to cpusets to make
it possible to bolt the CKRM/RG resource controllers on to it?
