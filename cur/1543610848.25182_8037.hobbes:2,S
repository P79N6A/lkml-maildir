All the -pre's are before the final, but not release candidates. I think
the rc until recently has been the one where someone said "we've put a
hell of a lot of new stuff in this..." and concentrated on reported bugs,
if any.

Other than some quibbling about nomenclature, that's how I see it. We
always had an alpha version for in-house testing only, then a beta for
selected users, which for Linux would be those who have the guts to run
the downloads, and then a release.
I did commenrcial software development for a few decades and that was
usually the practice, and that's what people like Microsoft were doing
when I did a few beta tests for them. I think it's a good model for Linux
stable kernel series.
