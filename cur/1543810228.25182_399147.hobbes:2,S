Pavel,
	Matthew has shown up on the libsmbios-devel mailing list. I sent
all the
info needed to do a test of Dell LCD brightness control. The main thing
left
would be to make one utility out of the current separate, unsupported,
test 
utils. 
	As for fixing i8k, I don't have the slightest clue where to
begin. You 
either have to split initialization with userspace to parse and send in
the 
correct io/magic ports to do SMI, or you have to put Dell-specific SMI
token 
parsing in the kernel.
	If somebody wants to discuss the design, I can definetly
discuss. I 
even have a _very_ rough mockup of userspace code to do this. Did not
take
it further because I don't know enough about lmsensors or how to fix
i8k.

Perhaps authors of libsmbios could help here?

Well, folks reverse-engineering your machines had no idea until now...

Could you or someone at Dell submit patches to correct this?
