The benchmarks here have a slight flaw in that the main hardware components 
tested are not given.  About the only thing I can see regarding these tests 
is what processor they run on.  Displaying network performance tests without 
showing the network card or io tests without showing the disk controller 
seems rather odd.  I guess it comes down to requesting a full hardware 
rundown.  If this is displayed someplace on the site or elsewhere please 
provide the link.
