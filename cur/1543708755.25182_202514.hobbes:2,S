Subject: [PATCH] ppc64 iommu rewrite part 2/5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Fix /dev/mem idea of what is memory on ppc64
This add a hack to /dev/mem (along with the other ones
already there) to prevent mapping cacheable of the IO hole.
Without this, XFree blows up on machines with enough memory
to go past the IO hole. It also tries to prevent memory from
beeing mapped uncached. Cache paradoxes are evil and can
kill the CPU. 
The necessary page_is_ram() call was added by the previous
patch doing the proper IO hole accounting.
Ben.
