Just to add a couple of my own:
5) Since one of the expected uses of this is char DMA drivers, it would be
nice to include something that builds a scatter/gather list of PCI bus
addresses from the kiovec[] array information.
6) Documentation on this interface is non-existent.
7) If the BIGMEM stuff is going to allow data to exist in areas that PCI
can't access, we need some way of handling this. I think that this will
present a problem on some systems, but am not sure if the hardware already
has a method for handling this or not. I would suspect it would be best to
handle it in the map_user_kiobuf() routine, since that is the routine that
makes sure that everything is in physical memory.
For my own use, I would also like to get a patch put together that makes
this interface available in 2.2 kernels. That way people don't have to wait
for 2.4 before using my device.
