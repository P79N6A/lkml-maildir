Someone (Peter Osterlund IIRC) mailed a patch with the "vma->vm_file" =>
"vma->vm_file->private_data" fix to lkml.  Thats actually the place I
forgot on the first attempt and which causes the tvtime crashes
mentioned in the changelog.
My patches are built against a fresh linus bk tree, not against -mm, so
its probably just that patch being merged into -mm which causes the
rejects.  No problem, my patch obsoletes this one-liner fix.
