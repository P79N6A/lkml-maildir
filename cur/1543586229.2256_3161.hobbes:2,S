I have the feeling that there is going something wrong with the parameters. I 
modified the opl3sa2 driver and manually set the hw_config->io_base variable 
to 0x538 and now THIS part of the sound card initialization is working. But 
now it says that there is an I/O conflict with MSS. Maybe this parameter is 
also 0x0 and not  0x530 as I specified with the mss_io parameter... I will 
investigate further...
