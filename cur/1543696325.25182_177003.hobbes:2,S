    I haven't tried, but I'm afraid it won't solve my problem. First,
if I do a 'binded' mount of /proc, any change in the chrooted proc
will reflect in the original one, so I'm in trouble anyway. Second,
if I do 'mount' or 'cat /proc/mounts' the proc filesystem will be
shown twice anyway (correct me here if I'm wrong).
    By now I'm going to keep using two independent mounts until I
find a better approach... Thanks for your answer :)
