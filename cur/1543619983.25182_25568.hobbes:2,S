Hello,
is there a UNDI (Universal Network Driver Interface, a part of the 
PXE-specification) for the 2.4x kernel available?
We found one from Intel in its linux-pxe-sdk for the 2.2.x kernel. This 
one works, but not with all pxe-networkcards.
Potentially we will port it from 2.2 to 2.4 or rewrite it for 2.4 with 
a little assistance.
TIA for all information,
	Tobias
