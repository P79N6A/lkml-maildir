Just to add a little more fule to the fire here..
 
OS: Linux 2.2.12
Dist: RedHat 6.0 w/ updated 6.1 Glibc (2.1.2)
PHP Version: 3.0.12
PHP Bug Type: Repoducable crash
Bug description: segfault on startup
 
I have the same problem that was described by xmatl@fi.muni.cz and also
has been reported to the Debian mailing lists as bug #43100
 
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/debian/Bugs/db/43/43100.html
 
I'm using Apache 1.3.9 and I can build MySQL support without a problem.
However, when I build using "--with-openlink" for OpenLink driver support,
I get the same problem. Apache starts, forks off a sub process which
segfaults w/ the following errors;
 
25635 open("/etc/httpd/conf/php3.ini", O_RDONLY) = 6
25635 ioctl(6, TCGETS, 0xbfffcad8)      = -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for
device)
25635 read(6, "[PHP_3]\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n"..., 8192) = 8192
25635 read(6, "=\tOn\t; allow or prevent persis"..., 8192) = 3129
25635 read(6, "", 5063)                 = 0
25635 read(6, "", 8192)                 = 0
25635 ioctl(6, TCGETS, 0xbfffcac4)      = -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for
device)
25635 --- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---                                      
 
Here are the exact options that I am using to build..
 
./configure \
        --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs \
        --prefix=/usr \
        --with-gd \
        --with-mysql \
        --with-openlink \
        --enable-safe-mode \
        --with-exec-dir=/usr/bin \
        --disable-short-tags \
        --with-zlib \
        --with-dbase \
        --with-filepro \
        --with-imap \
        --with-config-file-path=/etc/httpd/conf \
        --disable-debug \
        --enable-magic-quotes \
        --enable-debugger \
        --enable-bcmath \
        --enable-track-vars \
        --with-system-regex
Any helpful suggestions would be appreciated.
