A third option would be if people add new functions (with no users) in
-rc2 or -rc3 timeframes as long as it is part of a fully reviewed
patch with users that will use those new features in various kernel
development trees.
Since there wouldn't be any users in Linus's tree, there's no risk in
making those functions available in mainline ahead of time.
