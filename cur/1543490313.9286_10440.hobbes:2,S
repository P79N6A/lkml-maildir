Its definatley linux's ppp. There are sites that it simply won't transfer
to/from.
I had the same problem with a HOST of sites. Since my network topography
looks something like:
                           | machine 1
                           | machine 2
[internet] <---> [gw box] -| machine 3
                           | machine 4
                           | machine 5
and I was running Apache on one of my machines, I decided to use Apache's
mod_proxy and set my windows boxes[1] to proxy through it.
After that, I've never seen another hangup. I should mention that hangs
don't exist in the 2.0.3x kernel that RH5.2 is shipped with.
Its definately the kernel. Definately.
[1] where I was experiencing the hangs.
G'day!
