Patch looks generally ok.  Some of the whitespace/formatting changes are
questionable, I usually leave that up to the maintainer unless it is
very gratuitously opposite to CodingStyle.
Some of the driver messages ("foo version 1.0") are purposefully printed
-after-, not before, the device is probed and registered.  Your patch
gets this wrong in at least one place.
Finally, a word to you, Alan, and others doing request_region work:  it
is more informative to pass the device name (minor, etc.) into
request_region.  Ditto for request_irq.  Many (most, except net?)
drivers use board/chip name instead of registered interface name.  If
you can use the interface name for request_region or request_irq, use
it... it allows differentiation between multiple boards of the same
type.  That's especially when looking at ISA regions in /proc/ioports,
or interrupt counts in /proc/interrupts.
