Sparc64 happens to order the atomic we use in the bitops and atomic_t
ops, so sparc64 gets this right by accident.
I had no idea about this requirement before reading your email.
If IBM is seeing race this on ppc64, then I'm even more confused.
If Anton understands the requirements, then ppc64 should have
the return value atomic's implemented with the proper barriers.
