Subject: Bug in latest TCP code (2.3.49) ?

    I see some very strange behaviour here between two 2.3.49 Linux machines.
Basically TCP conenction seem to hang. tcpdump (showing a ftp-data transfer)
attached. I can't figure out why this is happening. The network is 100M,
non-switched but very quiet during the tests. Also, this behaviour does not
seem to appear between a 2.3.49 and a 2.2.14, nor between a 2.3.49 and a
win98. The network driver is 8139too.
    I can supply more information / do more tests if needed.
