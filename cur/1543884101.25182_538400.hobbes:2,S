If you would avoid making inflammatory comments, the people who are trying to 
help you will be more inclined to fix the problems that these patches DO cause 
so they can be added.
A while ago, you went on and on about your broken floppy drive and how people 
shouldn't do things that break other systems - even if they have no idea that 
was happening - yet here you are now demanding people do the same thing.
It's easy to maintain your own changes to the kernel until equivalent changes 
are committed - you need to be much more patient, especially when something is 
being done about them.
