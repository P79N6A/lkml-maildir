The http transport isn't very good for git, so git adds various special 
files to make it work at all. They need to be specially updated, and I 
hadn't done that.
Using the native git protocol through git://git.kernel.org/.. gets around 
it, as does using rsync. 
I just repacked and updated it now, so how http should work too, although 
inefficiently (because it will get a whole new pack - just one of the 
disadvantages of the non-native protocols).
