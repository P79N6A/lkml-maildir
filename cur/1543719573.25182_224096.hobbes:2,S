Made a little more progress...
Turns out the infinite loop wasn't in the CONFIG_HIGMEM while() loop, but 
rather in the while() loop at the top of the code.  Sorry about that.  I 
misunderstood the disassembly until now.
So basically both types of crashes I am seeing (NULL deref and infinite
loop) are happening in the primary/top while() loop of prune_icache()  
and I suspect they are both the result of a corrupted inode_unused list.
Now I am trying to figure out where/how the inode_unused list is getting
corrupted...  If anyone has any existing code for validating list
integrity, which I could sprinkle around the code, I'd love a copy.
Thanks,
Chris
