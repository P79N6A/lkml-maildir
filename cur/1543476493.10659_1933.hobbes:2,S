	There is a serious bug in recent kernels with the timeout of the poll()
	system call. The calculation to turn the timeout value from milliseconds
	into whatever schedule_timeout() expects is wrong. The following happened
	when I read my mail with mutt. I use a development glibc (2.1.106) which
	uses poll() when it is available in the kernel. As soon as I opened read a
	mail message my screen got spammed with hundreds of lines saying:
	schedule_timeout: wrong timeout value f3333335 from 00024c0e
	I looked up where address 00024c0e was, it turned out to be do_poll() in
	fs/select.c
	I decided to strace mutt, to see what it did, and it did a series of poll()
	syscalls like this:
	poll([{fd=0, events=POLLIN}], 1, 2147483647) = 0
	That value is INT_MAX, and should be valid.
Hmm - yesterday I complained that you should have been more precise
with this `recent kernels', but I happened to come along this code in
select.c for some other reason. It must not produce a negative timeout.
The change below makes sure of that.

[the expression (timeout*HZ+999)/1000+1 is also a bit peculiar,
but I have not changed it]
