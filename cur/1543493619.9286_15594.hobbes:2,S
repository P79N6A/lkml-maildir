   This is a reasonable assumption, but turns out not to have been
   the case. The Posix P1003.1e/2c effort began in 1986 as a
   /usr/group draft, presented by AT&T's Unix Systems Lab. At the
   time only Gould (anyone remeember them?) had actually fielded
   anything. We were all under the specter of the "C2 in '92"
   directive, and were pretty clueless. The effort moved to POSIX
   about a year later because two someones (names withheld until
   someone buys me that beer...) felt that AT&T was trying to railroad
   their plans into a standard. They were, by the way. So, the
   POSIX security group (P1003.6 at the time) became a giant design
   committee, representing every vendor of note and many important
   customers. The POSIX draft does not reflect the vendor's
   implementations, the implementations reflect the draft. The only
   exceptions I know of are SVR4ES, which stuck with what they'd
   entered the fray with, and HP, which holds tightly to their
   SecureWare heritage in some ways.
Ah, thanks for describing the history.  I had wondered why Trusted HPUX
was different from the draft and from the rest of the other Trusted
Unices.
Will you be at Linux Expo?  I wouldn't mind buying you that beer....
