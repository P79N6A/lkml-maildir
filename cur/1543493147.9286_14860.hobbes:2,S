Andrej Presern seems to view security in a very mathematical way, without
concern for stupid human errors. It is true that you could just enable
all the rights you have and "rm -rf /" at will, but that requires full
control over the executable _and_ evil intent.
Reduced bits in the effective set gives you:
1. some protection from stupid mistakes
2. some protection from trusted executables with bugs

This does not make a difference, since the stack overrun can _be_ a
shell after it loads some more code. There is no need to exec().
Using threads, the exploit code could even emulate multiple processes.

I have a proposal (now fixed; it had some bad typos) that seems to
improve the capabilities system in a compatible manner. I propose min
and max data as follows:
pm   Always set these.
pM   If ~pM would be in pP' after the exec, then return -EPERM.
fm   If these bits would not be in pP' after the exec, then return -EPERM.
fM   Remove unset bits from pm. (?)
Calculation becomes something like this:
new_pP = old_fP | (old_fI & old_pI) | old_pm;
if(new_pP & ~old_pM) return -EPERM;   /* getting prohibited caps? */
if((new_pP & old_pm) != old_pm) return -EPERM; /* not enough? */
(the rest inherits in the obvious or documented way)
If you missed the above, then you also missed some background discussion.
