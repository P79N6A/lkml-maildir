One problem I see right off the bat with this is that your kernel image
name (and label) in LILO can only be so long, and if you apply too many
patches (acpi+xfs+preempt+low etc.) it would become too long.  This may be
an extreme case, but it can happen (I usually apply apci, preempt, low,
sched, etc., though the ck patch does most of this for me now).
