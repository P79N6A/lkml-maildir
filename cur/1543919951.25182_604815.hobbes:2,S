Komuro, every single email I sent to you bounces with "user unknown",
I bet it is some spam filter or similar that doesn't like the
fact that I lack reverse DNS.
Can someone tell Komuro this side-band?  He also missed my
previous reply, which directed him to make his report on
netdev@vger.kernel.org which is very important.
