The sleeping part is correct.  That will make libata put the disk to sleep.

But the waking up part isn't.  You need to issue wake up explicitly by 
doing 'echo -n 0 > /sys/...'  I've been a complete idiot in this thread. 
  Please excuse me.  :-(
I think the solution to your problem is adjusting command timeout to 
more reasonable values which should make the problem more bearable. 
It'll take some time to figure out how to make timeouts more intelligent 
without breaking support for slow devices.  I'll work on that.
I'm attaching a temporary patch for the time being.
