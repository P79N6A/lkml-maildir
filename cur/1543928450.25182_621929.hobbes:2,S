Hello All,
I want to compile external linux kernel module without
using KBUILD.
I tried to find out whole process of kernel module
compilation using KBUILD after enabling flag 
KBUILD_VERBOSE=1.
If we look at 2.6 kernel module building process.
1. gcc is making ".hello.o.d" and ".tmp_hello.o"
   from "hello.c" file.
2. Creating "hello.o" file using ".hello.o.d"
   and ".tmp_hello.o". 
3. Running Script "scripts/mod/modpost" to
   create "hello.mod.c" using hello.o.
4. gcc is making "hello.mod.o" after compiling 
   "hello-mod.c" file.
5. finally "ld" is linking "hello.o"
   and "hello.mod.o" and making "hello.ko". 
Step 2 of above process is not very much cleared, how
it is making hello-2.o from ".hello.o.d" and
".tmp_hello.o".
What is ".tmp_hello.o.
Do we have any document which describe how to make
kernel module without using KBUILD.
Any pointer of information is very helpful for me.
Thanks 
Murtuja Bharmal
