Subject: [PATCH] Only scan the root bus in early PCI quirks.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Only scan the root bus in early PCI quirks.
We found a situation on Linus' machine that the Nvidia timer
quirk hit on a Intel chipset system. The problem is that the
system has a fancy Nvidia card with an own PCI bridge, and
the early-quirks code looking for any NVidia bridge triggered
on it incorrectly. This didn't lead a boot failure by luck,
but the timer routing code selecting the wrong timer first and 
some ugly messages. It might lead to real problems on
other systems.
Update: according to Suresh the problem can cause real boot failures
together with x2apic.
I checked all the devices which are currently checked for
by early_quirks and it turns out they are all located in 
the root bus zero.
So change the early-quirks loop to only scan bus 0. This
incidently also saves quite some unnecessary scanning work,
because early_quirks doesn't go through all the non root
busses. I don't expect that it will make the boot visible
faster, but doing less work is still good.
The graphics card is not on bus 0, so it is not matched
anymore.
