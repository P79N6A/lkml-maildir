I suspect part of the problem with commercial driver support on Linux is that
the Linux driver API (such as it is) is relatively poorly documented and seems
to change almost on a week-by-week basis anyway. I've done my share of chasing
the current kernel revision with drivers that aren't part of the kernel tree:
by the time you update the driver to work with the current kernel revision,
there's a new one out, and the driver doesn't compile with it.
