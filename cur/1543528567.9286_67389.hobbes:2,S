I've sent a patch for this about 2 month ago but it hasn't been
accepted. It was intended to flush all masq entries. I suppose it
has not been accepted because in my case there was an other way
to match my needs by echoing 1 or 2 to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr.
It's very small (less than 1.5 kB), you can get it from :
http://www-miaif.lip6.fr/willy/pub/linux-patches/patch-2.2.14-masqflush.gz
it includes the userspace program in Documentation/networking.
I think we could include this little patch into the mainstream kernels
because it may be usefull to several people (let's say 2.2.15 if Alan agrees).
I personnaly use it to flush all my masq entries once my line goes down.
