The existing build breakage is unacceptable too.  It's this bogosity
	#ifdef CONFIG_HDLC_MODULE
	#define CONFIG_HDLC 1
	#endif
which directly causes the build breakage.
Unless someone fixes it The Right Way, my patch seems like the best we 
can do.  People who complain "you must be able to build without hdlc" 
should step up and make it so.  Currently, it is not so.
