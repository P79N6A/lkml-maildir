Keith, are you working on the reserve hotadd case? It looks really 
broken, at the same time we both assume the hot add region contains RAM 
per e820 (use of reserve_bootmem_node()) and at the same time in other 
places (in reserve_hotadd()) that it may not contain RAM. And 
nodes_cover_memory() is broken no matter what we assume.
