build scripts: fixdep blows segfault on string CONFIG_MODULE seen
The string "CONFIG_MODULE" appearing anywhere in a source file causes
fixdep to segfault.  This string appeared in the wild in the current
mISDN sources (I think they meant CONFIG_MODULES).  But it shouldn't
segfault (esp as CONFIG_MODULE appeared in a quoted string).

This is not an important fix per see - but I do not like SEGV during compilation...
Will be pushed to Linus today.
