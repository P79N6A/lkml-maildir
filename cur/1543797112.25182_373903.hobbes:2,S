Yes, file systems tend to mostly be about the corner cases though...  :-)

Ugly, huh?  The options seem to be to either write out all of the data
to the server or just truncate it.  I have seen the former used mostly,
although this does generate the "last one there wins" scenario.  This
does match the usual semantics associated with normal cached data from
write(2)s and should fit well with the NFSv4 callback notifying that a
write delegation is being withdrawn.
    Thanx...
