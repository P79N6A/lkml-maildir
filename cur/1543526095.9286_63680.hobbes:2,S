This is all doable as I said from the very beginning but it'll require DEEP
rework of VFS, not just small changes. It IS usefull (for example for discussed
here situation where you have big disk with rarely used stuff and want to not
re-fsck it after crash if in fact disk was not used) but it's also HARD work
if you want to do it right.
