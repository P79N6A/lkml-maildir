Yup, and I can confirm two things:
 - the strings match 100% (well, duh, we already saw that from the binary)
 - it doesn't even have an "errno.h"
that, together with the timing, pretty much proves that the kernel header
was indeed just auto-generated from sys_errlist[] of that timeframe, with 
a program very much like the one I already posted.
Now, the libc file just says 
	/* This is a list of all known signal numbers.  */
(which is obviously just a cut-and-paste from siglist.c n the same 
directory). But it shouldn't much matter, since I don't think SCO really 
is going to try to claim copyright ownership of the result of standard C 
library interactions like using "sys_errlist[]".
(I take that back - _of_course_ they are going to try to claim ownership. 
After all, they already claimed ownership of code I provably wrote).
