Hi,
It's very likely that Linux does report what the drives returns,
as this field is in the same structure with the other fields
(model, size, etc), and the entire structure is passed to the
host on one command.
However, as far as I remember, the ATA-2 standard defines 0kB as
"unspecified buffer cache size". That is, when the drive reports 0kB
it doesn't want the OS to assume anything about the internal cache
size. It doesn't necessarily mean that there is no cache.
