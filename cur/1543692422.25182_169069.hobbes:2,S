Arnaldo,
I guess I am one of those I-wanna-triple-my-kernel-performance-
by-compiling-the-kernel-for-exactly-what-I-have hordes. Although I don't 
think it actually triples my kernel performance ))-:
Those people anyway recompile the kernel if they want some feature 
(un)included.
And I'd say RTM (ah, that should be RTH -- Read The Help) if they don't 
understand it. It's what I do.
I would expect those that know enough to reconfigure the kernel also 
know enough to understand the help that will undoubtedly be provided 
with this option?
