It doesn't matter in this case.  The "don't break the build at any stage of
a series" preference exists because it's extremely irritating to hit a
won't-build in the middle of a git-bisect operation.
But anybody who is bisection searching for a bug won't want to enable a
brand-new driver in their config, so no problems.
