That is the way it is meant to be.  /usr/include/{linux,asm} do not
point to some random kernel source, they are _copies_ of the kernel
headers at the time that glibc was built and must not change until you
install a new glibc.
User space applications must not rely on including "current" kernel
headers, you do not know which headers would be available when the app
is installed.  If a user space app requires kernel information then it
must have its own headers that contain that data.  The app must also
cope with being run on newer or older kernels than it was compiled for,
that is, it must handle version skew between user space and kernel
interfaces.  If your design requires a user space application including
"current" kernel headers then your design is broken and you are own
your own.
