It's in netdev-2.6.git#ALL that gets included in -mm.

And it seems to be your fault.  ;-)
commit 58e5528ee464d38040b9489e10033c9387a10d56

    [PATCH] bcm43xx: init routine rewrite
    Rewrite of the bcm43xx initialization routines.
    This fixes several issues:
    * up-down-up-down-up... stale data issue
      (May fix some DHCP issues)
    * Fix the init vs IRQ handler race (and remove the workaround)
    * Fix init for cards with multiple cores (APHY)
      As softmac has no internal PHY handling (unlike dscape),
      this adds the file "phymode" to sysfs.
      The active PHY can be selected by writing either a, b or g
      to this file. Current PHY can be determined by reading from it.
    * Fix the controller restart code.
      Controller restart can now also be triggered through
      echo 1 > /debug/bcm43xx/ethX/restart
