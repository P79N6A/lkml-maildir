Yes, we should probably move the set_scheduler call in stop_machine
(where the thread up-prioritizes itself) to before wake_up_process(p),
to avoid this happening.
Others have suggested we use the freezer; I've always distrusted that
code.  It's much trickier than stop_machine().
I look forward to your patch!
Rusty.
