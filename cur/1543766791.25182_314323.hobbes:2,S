Subject: [UML] Compile error when building with seperate source and object directories

I've been seeing a build error when trying to build User Mode Linux on
an x86-32 host (Athlon, fwiw).  The kernel I'm building is a 1-day old
pull from git.  This error is not new, though.  I thought it was merely
an artifact of a patch stuck in a queue at first so I didn't mention it
right away.

I'm not quite sure what's going on here - but something seems broken.
My gut feeling is that arch/um/Kconfig_arch is supposed to be a symlink
(or something else magical) pointing at arch/um/Kconfig_i386, but this
doesn't seem to be working.
I can provide my .config if it matters - but since the above failure
happens almost instantly, I don't think it will matter much.
Thanks!
