util-linux should be using getpagesize() or sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)
from the C library.  And libc should be getting the page size
within ldso (or _start for static apps) by parsing the AT_PAGESZ
entry from the ELF auxiliary vector.  Should that be 0 (i.e.
because the kernel is horribly broken) then and only then should
libc fall back to guessing, i.e. a page size of 4k.  A quick check
shows that glibc, uClibc, and klibc all get this right.  But you
are right, that util-linux looks to have this wrong in a few
places.  I expect fixing the kernel headers will get that fixed
in short order.  :-)
