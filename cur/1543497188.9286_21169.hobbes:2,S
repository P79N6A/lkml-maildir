Well, it's been a well-known problem since as far back as RH 4.2.
It has persisted all this time -- I checked on #linux and others confirmed
it.
Is there a 'back door' to get a terminal session?  What about Alt-SysRq?
My own systems have all been i486+.  The lockup seems to occur at random
times when Netscape is up.  There is constant disk activity during the
problem; response is slow -- 30 seconds for the cursor to move after
the mouse has moved -- sometimes.
What information should I gather when the problem recurs?  I _may_ have a
set of data that can reproduce the problem -- it is a message of my wife's
on usa.net that locked it up twice.
I realize that this a "something's wrong, please fix it" request, but it
points to a long-standing problem: that of ending a rogue program.
Perhaps someone else can provide more information.
