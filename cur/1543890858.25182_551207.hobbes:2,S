What are you agreeing with, Dave?
Are you agreeing that "it seems wasteful to add per-packet overhead"?
This patch is not doing that.
A quick grep shows that most things are using multi-second timeouts
here. Of the ones that aren't, a number are using .4s, and many more
aren't even in units of HZ. Makes me wonder if the various boards
using 50ms are being overzealous.
