Hi
I found two problems concerning the fast ethernet driver 
for ppc 8xx processors (fec.c) in linux kernel version 2.4.26/27 
and I think in the 2.6 series as well (not confirmed).
First problem is only when CONFIG_USE_MDIO is __not__ set.
How to reproduce:
start the system with fec ethernet, everything works, 
issue a ifconfig ethX down and ifconfig ethX up and ethernet is not working anymore.
Fix (or at least a workaround). In fec_enet_open() add a fec_restart() at the end 
if CONFIG_USE_MDIO is not set.
2nd problem is with CONFIG_USE_MDIO set: 
The promiscuous mode/multicast settings are getting lost if link status changes occurs 
How to reproduce:
build a bridge with the fec device. Then simply unplug and replug the ethernet cable. 
fec_restart() is called which idles all promiscuous mode/multicast settings.
The bridge will then only forward broadcast frames because the promiscuous setting is lost.
Fix: call set_multicast_list(dev) at the end of fec_restart() before ethernet is reenabled.
If there are more questions please write back.

Harald
