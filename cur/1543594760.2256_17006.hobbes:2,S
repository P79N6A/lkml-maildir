I'd like that too, but what about sync writes?  As things stand now, there is 
no option but to spin the disk back up.  To get around this we'd have to 
change the basic behavior of the block device and that's doable, but it's an 
entirely different proposition than the little patch above.
You know about this project no doubt:
   
http://noflushd.sourceforge.net/
This is really complementary to what I did.  Lightweight is not really a good 
way to describe it though, the tar is almost 10,000 lines long.  There is 
probably a clever thing to do at the kernel level to shorten that up.
There's one thing I think I can help fix up while I'm working in here, this 
complaint: 
    Reiserfs journaling bypasses the kernel's delayed write mechanisms and    
    writes straight to disk.
We need to address the reasons why such filesystems have to bypass kupdate.  
This touches on how sync and fsync work, updating supers, flushing the inode 
cache etc, but with Al Viro's superblock work merged now we could start 
thinking about it.

Yes, that still works with my patch.  The noflushd user space daemon works by 
turning off kupdate (set update time to 0).
