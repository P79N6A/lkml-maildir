Unfortunately I think it's way too soon for that.  Even if stacker is
accepted, it is still a module (for now at least) which can be compiled
out.  So we'll need dummy hooks for modules (like seclvl) to use.  I
just don't think it's possible to get rid of that yet.

I think your patches to make capability the default are the best
place to start.  Doing the same under stacker will be trivial, and
I'll do that in the next set I send out.
thanks,
