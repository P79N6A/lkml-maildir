Was it entirely necessary to post an 800k patch to 2 mailing
lists of which I'm on both?  It could have at least been gzipped,
or better yet put on a web site with a URL.  With an address like
@caldera.de, I would assume you'd have a good idea of technical
know how and such.  I'm assuming thus that it was an
accident.  So please just be more careful in the future.  Large
patches should generally never get posted to lists.  Those that
want them will go get them from the web somewhere or FTP.
I'm looking forward to the new console code, but not at 2Mb a day
in my inbox.  ;o)
take care,
TTYL
