Actually they are highly useful if you know how to use them. They allow

The last sentence seems correct in spite of your misunderstanding of how 
and why enums are used and useful. Like a driver who mis-read a map 
wandering aimlessly and lost, you have come to the correct destination 
by accident.

changing now because of the effort involved.
