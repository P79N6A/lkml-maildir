Recent kernels have been moving towards the (IMHO correct) approach of
having ACPI and APM being drivers which register themselves as generic
power management drivers (apm.c, acpi.c, pm.c).  This progression
implies to me that there needs to be a single userspace power management
daemon, not apmd and acpid.
Also, we have a bunch of daemons which handle kernel suspend, resume,
device attach, and device detach events.  apmd, acpid, devfsd,
pcmcia_cs, ...
Is it reasonable to cook up a single outlet to userspace for device
state events like power states, attach, detach, etc.?
