Minor nit, but if this is headed for Documentation/ioctl/* or similar,
maybe we can avoid having N copies of the usual GPL boiler plate; one
copy vs. one in each of kbd_ioctl, tty_ioctl, blk_ioctl, etc etc ?

+  See also kbd_mode(1).
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I see you haven't added info on all of the KD* ioctl entries - some of 
which I agree aren't really kbd related (e.g. KDMKTONE) - did you forsee
putting these in another file, perhaps with the other vt ioctls?
Paul.
