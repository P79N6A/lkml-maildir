Well, I don't think the naming necessarily has to be about notifiers, but 
it should be at least a *bit* more scary than "mm_lock()", to make it 
clear that it's pretty dang expensive. 
Even without the vmalloc and sorting, if it would be used by "normal" 
things it would still be very expensive for some cases - running thngs 
like ElectricFence, for example, will easily generate thousands and 
thousands of vma's in a process.
