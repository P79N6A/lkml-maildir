Ok, the MIT license could get you that.  Even public domain could.

GPL won't get you that.  You want a non-Free Software license.
It will only as long as people play along nicely and perceive the
benefits of cooperation.  But some players don't.

I can't morally recommend a non-Free Software license.

No.  Honestly, I really don't.  Even when I try and look at it from
your perspective, that you described very beautifully in the rest of
the message that I snipped, it's still a mistery to me why you think
permitting Tivoization could possibly be advantageous to your project.
What is it in the anti-Tivoization provision that gets you any less
improvements back?
If anything, I'd think that, by not permitting TiVO to prohibit users
from running modified versions of your code that they don't authorize
themselves, these users would do *more* than TiVO alone ever could,
and if a fraction of them contributes something back, you're way
better off.
