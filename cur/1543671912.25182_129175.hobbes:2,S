   Yes, I'd considered that and eventually settled for the non-prefixed version
   since it followed the pattern set by single_release() which doesn't have
   the seq_ prefix. I don't mind changing it though if the prefixed version is
   preferred,
I think a naming convention without a prefix is asking for
trouble.  I'd ask that you add the prefix, the current convention
is troublesome and someone ought to clean that up.
