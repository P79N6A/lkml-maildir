FUD.  I added to three areas of existing code:
i) Every man and his dog uses mempools in conjuction with slabs, so
   rather than having everyone redefining their own alloc/free
   functions I added the following huge functions to mempool.c.  In no
   way were they mandatory.
    /*
     * A commonly used alloc and free fn.
     */
    void *mempool_alloc_slab(int gfp_mask, void *pool_data)
    {
            kmem_cache_t *mem = (kmem_cache_t *) pool_data;
            return kmem_cache_alloc(mem, gfp_mask);
    }
    void mempool_free_slab(void *element, void *pool_data)
    {
            kmem_cache_t *mem = (kmem_cache_t *) pool_data;
            kmem_cache_free(mem, element);
    }
ii) vcalloc, this *didn't* get merged, and will probably end up getting
    moved into dm.h.
iii) ioctl32 support: people have argued against an ioctl interface,
     and I'm inclined to agree with them, which is why I'm going to
     publish an fs interface shortly.  However, given that we are
     currently using an ioctl interface how do we avoid adding support for
     32bit userland/64 kernel space ?  If EVMS isn't touching these
     files does that mean they're not supporting these architectures ?
        arch/mips64/kernel/ioctl32.c
        arch/ppc64/kernel/ioctl32.c
        arch/s390x/kernel/ioctl32.c
        arch/sparc64/kernel/ioctl32.c
So given that (ii) didn't get merged, which of (i) and (iii) were you
objecting to ?
