At present no fbdev driver uses i2c. So it should be safe to move 
i2c_init_all ahead of fbmem_init without breaking anything. Petr is
working on a dual head patch for the G400 which requires i2c. Right now it
has to be compiled as a module for it to work because i2c is initialized
after fbmem_init.
There is another solution Petr mentioned.
