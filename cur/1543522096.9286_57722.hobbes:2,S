Geesh.. High brow humor goes right over some people's heads....
Look at Rick's posting again..  There is a "<grin>" that hints
that something is fishy...  Then "some folks believe anything
they see in text especially when they see it on a computer
screen".  Followed by a script which obviously is meant to show
Feb 30th, and to prove it wasn't doctored by hand the script was
timed before and after exectution.  Anyone with even one eyeball
and a bit of humor would immediately notice that the timing at
the end of the script is about a minute from when the script
started...  I doubt "cal 2 2000" takes a minute to run on even
the slowest 386 running with 50 users logged in doing povray
rendering.  ;o)
I got a good laugh because I knew that someone would not 'see the
humor' and would try and correct it...  Hehhe.
