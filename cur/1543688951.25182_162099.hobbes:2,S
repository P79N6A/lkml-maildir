There are several functions triggering this problem, and it's a mainline
2.4 problem (I don't see anything specific to my tree). 
I'm CCing the authors of the driver, is there a new version or are we the
first triggering it? I can fix it myself but I'd prefer to avoid any
duplication since it's not a one liner.
Thanks,
Andrea
