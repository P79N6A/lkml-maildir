Subject: initrd FAILURE on linux-2.4.17

Hello,
As previously reported, Linux-2.4.17 fails to mount a ram-disk
upon boot so it is impossible to use a kernel that does not have
the root file-system drivers built-in.
The attached file contains the previously-used script that has
made successful RAM-Disks since version 2.0.n and/or even before.
Within that directory is a new/modified script 'try', that attempts
to follow the changed documentation in
              linux-2.4.17/Documentation/initrd.txt
This attached file also contains the kernel configuration.
No matter what I do, the RAM disk is "found", but it is never
mounted so /linuxrc never is executed:

Following advice, I also re-compiled the kernel non-SMP.
This did not help.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
