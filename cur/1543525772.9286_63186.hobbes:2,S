Hello,
When trying to compile the ISDN subsystem as a module, I get the following error
message:

These errors appeared first in kernel 2.3.43. The `NET_BH undeclared' message
is a result of changes in include/linux/interrupt.h, and the other messages
come from changes in some structures (net_device for instance).
