Hi Chris,
Do you really need the parent inode in the filehandle?
That screws rename up pretty badly, since the filehandle changes when
you rename into a different directory. It means for instance that when
I do
open(foo)
mv foo bar/
write (foo)
close(foo)
then I have a pretty good chance of getting an ESTALE on the write()
statement.
Cheers,
  Trond
