Is this really worth fixing?
The code still has races there - for example, another process can come
after we've got the page, truncate it off the file then write new data.  So
this thread ends up copying out-of-date page contents out to userspace.
The application is being silly, and the silly application gets wrong data:
either out-of-date or zeroed.
afacit the patch shrinks the timing windows significantly, but at a cost:
moving a bunch of 64-bit arithmetic and seqlock operations into the inner
loop.
We could plug all this in a more predictable fashion by locking the page,
but then we have another instance of the
read-a-page-into-a-mmapped-copy-of-itself deadlock (I think - maybe it
can't happen because of page uptodateness checks).
