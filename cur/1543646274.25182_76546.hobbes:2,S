Not all that many drivers:
pcibios_find_class is used in the following files:
 	drivers/net/aironet4500_card.c
	drivers/net/wan/lmc/lmc_main.c
The lmc driver has only had 1 janitor cleanup in all of 2.5, and the
aironet4500_card driver has had only trivial changes too.  But I'll try
to fix them up, if anyone uses them, and I break them, I'm sure I'll
hear about it :)
pcibios_find_device is used in only 11 different drivers.  I'll go clean
up those instances too.
And I thought I caught all of the places that pcibios_present() was used
already, but I'll go verify that again.

I'll clean them all up and resubmit these changes to you when finished.
thanks,
