Here's what I have (same hardware and test setups):
Without the patch (but with Ram's patch applied):
------------------
Time spent for test: 125.4429s
no of times window reset because of hits: 0
no of times window reset because of misses: 127
no of times window was shrunk because of hits: 1153
no of times the page request was non-contiguous: 3968
no of times the page request was contiguous : 10686
With the patch:
---------------
Time spent for test:  86.5459s
no of times window reset because of hits: 0
no of times window reset because of misses: 0
no of times window was shrunk because of hits: 1066
no of times the page request was non-contiguous: 5860
no of times the page request was contiguous : 18099
I wonder if there are some plans to further improve 2.6 behavior on this 
workload to match that of 2.4? Is the remaing regression a result of the 
different readahead handling, or it might be caused by IDE driver or I/O 
scheduler tuning?
