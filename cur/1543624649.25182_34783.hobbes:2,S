 Hi James,
  I just took a quick look at your work on splitting this stuff up, and I
  think it's definitly heading in the right direction. As to integrating this,
  I think it's probably best to get Patrick Mochel's other related work
  included first. See what he's done so far at..

  His patch and yours touch various files for more or less the same reason.
  Patrick still has some bits to finish off here, but combined the two patchsets
  will bring some much needed sanity to various parts of arch/i386/
