I've got a machine here which redirects the console to the serial port using
Lilo 'append="console=ttyS0"' and it boots fine without a connection to the
serial port without having to do any specific manipulation of the flow control.
I think that all serial output is dumped to /dev/null if DCD is not asserted no
matter what the flow control says. Perhaps there are some hardware differences
in the configuration of the control signal pull-up/downs.
