Subject: md problems (2.4.0/2.4.1-pre7 on alpha)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

It looks like my first message was too large ... so a bit of trimming of
the error messages, and ...
Please find attached my .config file for 2.4.1-pre7, and the error logs
from trying to mount raid partitions under 2.4.0 and 2.4.1-pre7.
Trying to upgrade a system, running 2.2.17, to 2.4.x, and its getting
stuck on the raid5 partitions.
I've tried with/without devfs support, as well as booting with the
md=0,/dev/hdxx,/dev/hdxx,/dev/hdxx, as suggested in Documentation/md.txt
-- all to no avail.
Any suggestions?
