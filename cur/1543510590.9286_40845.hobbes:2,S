	I understand your concerns and agree .

	I thank you very much .  Not that I over-clock anything I own ,
	a few people I know do .  It would be nice if these individuals
	would first return their systems to an in-spec clock-rate & then
	try duplicate the problem they were experiencing & then if it is
	reproducable send out a query to a list .

	I've heard of some re-seller/Oem doing this but not with any of my
	oem contacts .  I haven't heard any names of re-seller/Oem 's that
	do this just a few discussions with disgruntled owners who found
	this to have been done to them .

	Total agreement ! Tnx,  JimL
