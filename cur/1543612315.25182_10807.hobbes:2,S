Did you look at PERCPU_ADDR in ia64?  Much (all?) of the per cpu data
is in struct cpuinfo_ia64 which is at the same virtual address on all
cpus but with different physical addresses on each cpu.  Let the mmu do
the work.  S390 does a similar trick, using the Prefixed Save Area
(PSA) which is virtual 0 but different physical addresses on each cpu.
