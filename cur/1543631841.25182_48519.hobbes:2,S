I like.  Very clean.

Why only decrement nr_uninterruptible if it is not already on a
runqueue?  I suspect because then you assume it is a spurious wakeup and
did not have a corresponding deactivate_task?  Same reason we increment
nr_running in activate_task and not here, I suspect... makes sense.
One thought on a quick way to test if the new method is returning
accurate results would be to leave the current count_active_task code
and then add:
	if (nr != (nr_running() + nr_uninterruptible()))
		printk("Danger Will Robinson!\n");
but you probably already did something similar.
