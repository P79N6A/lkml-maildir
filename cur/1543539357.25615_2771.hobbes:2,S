I don't know anything about this particular machine, but I used to be a BIOS
programmer.  Your BIOS should have a setting to enable "legacy USB
keyboard/mouse support".  Basically, this makes your USB keyboard look like a
PS/2 keyboard for "legacy" OS's (OS's that don't have USB keyboard drivers).  As
soon as the OS loads the USB drivers, the BIOS disables its USB support, and the
OS takes over.
If the OS is loading USB support but not USB keyboard support, that would
explain your problem.  Try building a kernel with absolutely no USB support.
