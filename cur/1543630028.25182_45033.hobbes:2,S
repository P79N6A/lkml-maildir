But why be slower when we don't have to.  And why slow down *all* architectures?

page++ is nicer yet.

The abstraction is already there.  I didn't create the logical space, I identified
it.  There are places where the code is really manipulating logical addresses, not
physical addresses, and these are not explicitly identified.  This makes the code
cleaner and easier to read.
Your question is really 'why introduce any abstraction', or maybe you're asking
'is this an abstraction worth introducing'?  Clearly it is, since it makes
bootmem run faster, with nothing but name changes.

But kernel coders have already done that in lots of places.  Why?  Because it's
a pain to to arithmetic where everything is at an offset, and difficult to read.
Not to mention, bulkier.

Look at drivers/char/mem.c, read_mem.  Clearly, the code is not dealing with
physical addresses.  Yet it starts off with virt_to_phys, and thereafter works
in zero-offset addresses.  Why?  Because it's clearer and more efficient to do
that.  The generic part of my nonlinear patch clarifies this usage by rewriting
it as virt_to_logical, which is really what's happening.
That's really what's happening in bootmem too.
