Subject: [PATCH] fix slab allocator for non zero boot cpu

Hi,
The slab allocator doesnt initialise ->array for all cpus. This means
we fail to boot on a machine with boot cpu != 0. I was testing current
2.5 BK.
Luckily Rusty was at hand to explain the ins and outs of initialisers
to me. Manfred, does this look OK to you?
