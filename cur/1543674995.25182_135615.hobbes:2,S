I left the loadbalancer to decide on where the homenode should be. And
the decision wasn't good enough (it lead to unbalanced nodes, that's
certainly not the case on Opteron :-). So it made sense to have a
specialized homenode chooser which considered the node loads instead
of changing the normal load balancer.
BTW: do you assign the homenode at first load balancing or at first
cross-node balancing?

For the processes with ilb_policy=FORK I chose the homenode and set
the cpu before the task is woken up. It is done in do_fork right after
the task structure has been cloned. wake_up_forked_process was changed
to lock the rq of the child (and not the one of current) and not set
the cpu any more. I don't think there was more...
