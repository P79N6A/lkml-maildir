I think there should be a boot-option to use ACPI for boot-time
configuration tables, but to not load the driver for run-time event
handling.  This is useful for enabling HT on systems with broken ACPI
run-time BIOS.
UnitedLinux uses "acpi=oldboot" for this.  While 'old' will become ambiguous
when today's "new" becomes tomorrow's "old";-), I do like "acpi={something}"
rather than complicating matters with non "acpi=" syntax.
Re: "acpismp=force"
I wouldn't miss it.  Sounds unanimous.
Re: "noht"
To disable HT on a uni-processor, wouldn't it be preferable to simply run
the UP kernel rather than the SMP kernel with HT disabled?  That leaves SMP
systems, where either the BIOS could disable it (it is a BIOS bug if it
can't), or as a last resort CONFIG_X86_HT (2.5) could be config'd out of the
kernel.  I guess I've talked myself into not missing "noht" also.
Cheers,
-Len
