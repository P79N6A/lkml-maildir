Following on from this, coding techniques which seek to document
assumptions in code tend to be very useful both to humans'
understanding of the code, and when attempting to catch strange bugs.
The most common and obvious of these is the assertion.  Looking at the
2.2 tree, assertions are widely used, but are somewhat different in
implementation from one subsystem to the next, and don't seem to be
standardized.
I remember a discussion a while back in this regard, with various
useful suggestions, among which were standard assertions which
documented when a routine was assuming that various smp locks were
held (and oopsed if called without locks held).
Are there any plans to put this stuff into place (perhaps in 2.5?).  I 
would be happy to help in the grunt work of adding them.
