Try booting with 'ide=nodma'.  Some compact flash cards support DMA
mode, and of course most IDE controllers support DMA mode, and if both
support it the kernel tends to try and enable it but if you don't have
the DMA lines connected it will fail and give annoying errors similar to
that one.  The DMA part of compact flash was a fairly recent addition
and the two affected lines used to be reserved on compact flash.  The
product I work on did not have the DMA lines on the previous board
design but we have it on the latest board revision.  On the old boards
we had to disable DMA support for IDE since otherwise certain types of
compact flash would have annoying timeouts trying to enable DMA.  On our
new board with the DMA lines, everything just works and the DMA access
gives about twice the read/write speed to the compact flash cards we are
using.
