Where is the size defined, and is it easy to modify?

Maybe.  I have been experimenting some more, and I see that the less
memory i have, kswapd takes more and more CPU (more than 10% for some
cases) when I am doing a continuous read from a block device.
I noticed that /proc/sys/vm/freepages is not writable any more.  Is there
any reason for this?

I first noticed the slowdown because the load meter LEDs on my ethernet
hub did not go as high with 2.4 as it did with 2.2.  A simple test,
transferring a large file using smbclient, did in deed show a decrease in
performance, both for a localhost and a remote file transfer.  This in
spite of the tcp transfer rate beeing (much) higher in 2.4 than in 2.2.

Hmm...  I'm still using samba 2.0.7.  I'll try 2.2 to see if it
helps.  What are tdb spinlocks?
Have you actually compared the same setup with 2.2 and 2.4 kernels and a
single client transferring a large file, preferably from a slow server
with little memory?  Most samba servers that people benchmark are fast
computers with lots of memory.  So far, every major kernel upgrade has
given me a performance boost, even for slow computers, and I would hate to
see that trend break for 2.4...
