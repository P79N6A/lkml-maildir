Attach is our latest patch for Ultra series.
We can discuss that if you got any info.

We are seeing some significant problems regarding ioctl() support in
this PDC patch on our 2.4.18 kernel.
Is there a newer patch available, if so, where can I find it?  can you
provide the
URL or attach it to a response.
I am sorry that we have not isolated it to the point of giving meaningful
error
messages, but we will work on that after we get the most recent patch.
