General comments related to your patch submission - not to the code.
- Each patch should have a descriptive subject for the said patch.
  The headlines you use below looks fine for this.
- Tag each subject with name of the framework so it is obvious
  they belong to the same area.
  Note that the numbers will be lost when the patches are applied to git.
- Each patch should contain a description of what it contains
  and why it is needed.
  You seem to have it written but it is 'hidden' in the 0/4
  mail that will not go into git - so the info is hard to find when
  the patches goes in.
- Each patch should contain a diffstat before the actual patch so
  it is obvious what is touched by the patch.
- The patches should not break the build.
  As your patches did not include any Makefile / Kconfig fragments
  I gues you have no issues here.
  It is typical to split up patches like you have done and apply
  the MAkefile/Kconfig bits as the final patch to make sure the kernel
  continue to build.
