Precisely the reason this huge thread is arguing why we shouldn't be 
including only static marker mechanism in the kernel tree. We are using 
dynamic probe mechanism which doesn't alter the execution flow or 
prevent compiler in making good optimizations for the most part but 
there are few code paths that are critical in understanding that we are 
not able to use this dynamic method for which we need static markers. As 
Martin pointed out if one is critical about performance they can be 
compiled out.
It is also important to note the amount of $s lost by taking long time 
to find a solution to a problem due to lack of good debugging tools is 
also significant compared to few additional clock cycles machines spend 
due to these static markers.

I am not sure i quiet understand your line number part of the proposal. 
Does this proposal assume we have access to source code while generating 
dynamic probes?

This still doesn't solve the problem of compiler optimizing such that a 
variable i would like to read in my probe not being available at the 
probe point.
