I think this is  what happen and why there are currently two messages:
* if the temperature is really critical you get (now) this:
----------------
kernel: Critical trip point (102 C) reached on Thermalzone [THM]
kernel: Critical temperature reached (150 C on [THM] with trip point set to: 
102 C), shutting down.
----------------
* and if something send a critical temp event to the thermal zone you get:
----------------
kernel: Critical temperature reached (42 C on [THM] with trip point set to: 
102 C), shutting down.
----------------
Maybe we can delete the first one, since you get now also from second 
message the information if the temperature was really critical or if 
there was an other reason for the shutdown, but in the past this was
IMO needed to differ.
