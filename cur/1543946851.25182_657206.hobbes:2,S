I had no problem with it, but Peter's objection seems substantial enough.

Well, the way we've handled this kind of thing elsewhere is to just 
reserve that pseudophys address space in earlish Xen init code and fill 
it with not-DMI things (zero, I guess).  It's a bit of a waste of 
memory, but maybe we can recover it once DMI has given up and gone 
away.  This also makes it easy to insert faked-up DMI info if that turns 
out to be useful.
