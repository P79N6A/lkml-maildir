All monolytic, except possibly MacOS X (don't know that one, and I remember
Apple's Linux was on Mach, because they wanted to build their OS based on
Mach, so it could be). WinNT was based on Mach, but is going to monolytic
step by step too. The OS of the huge multiprocessor CRAYs was a microkernel
OS running on what was essentially a cluster of machines with a very fast
internal network, dunno what became of that.
