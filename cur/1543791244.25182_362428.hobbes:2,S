I realise that and I will debug this when I have time to do so. At least
that patch identifies roughly where the problem is and allows me to
think about merging more code now my dev tree works again.
I passed the patch on to Pavel in the hope that it might solve his
immediate problem and give him a clue as to where to look for the real
solution if it does.

It is as I could have spent the time merging more Zaurus support instead
of chasing bugs. Several Zaurus related things I'd like to have seen
merged in 2.6.15 are looking unlikely to happen due to time
constraints :-(.
