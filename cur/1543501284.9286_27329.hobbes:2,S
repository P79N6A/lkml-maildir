well, uhh, if anyone's interested, i narrowed the problem down to just
SMP machines.  it sure seems like this symbol is pretty well exported,
and <linux/sched.h> is definitely #included in my source, but everyone
who tries to insmod it on an SMP machine (even me) gets the same
message:
mymod-smp-2.2.10: unresolved symbol tasklist_lock
i'm told that tasklist_lock's type, rwlock_t, is defined differently and
"works different" in SMP, but i'm not exactly sure what kind of
ramifications it would have for me.  do i need some special ifdefs to
get this to work in SMP?  thanks.
i don't subscribe to this list (yet), so i'd appreciate cc's in the
responses.  thanks.
