OK.  I'll send them to you privately as replies to this mail.
The first patch (which needs a little tightening up) adds support for
accessing and printing all 4k of configuration space with the -xxx option.
The second patch (incomplete) adds support for the Express capability.
There's some stuff it doesn't decode yet.  I'll be updating this patch
on Monday, I expect.
The third patch (even more incomplete) adds infrastructure for walking
and decoding extended capabilities.

to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
