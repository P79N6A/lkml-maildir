The stdint.h shipped with glibc says:
<--  snip  -->
/* Unsigned.  */
typedef unsigned char           uint_fast8_t;
#if __WORDSIZE == 64
typedef unsigned long int       uint_fast16_t;
typedef unsigned long int       uint_fast32_t;
typedef unsigned long int       uint_fast64_t;
#else
typedef unsigned int            uint_fast16_t;
typedef unsigned int            uint_fast32_t;
__extension__
typedef unsigned long long int  uint_fast64_t;
#endif
<--  snip  -->
