No, just when starting up.  It doesn't even need to be in KDE; in fact, I've
never noticed it in KDE since I start in text mode and check my mail before
starting X (you know how it's impossible to hold off checking mail).  Your
problem sounds different since it's in 2.4, also, and I never saw this in 2.4.
However, KDE and sound don't always agree, in my experience.  They can't even
get their own sounds right sometimes; when shutting it down their "shutdown"
tune is always cut off as the aRts server exits before it finishes playing the
sound.  This, of course, is not static.
