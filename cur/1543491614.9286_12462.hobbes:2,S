That's odd, because I already have it working. :)

No problem.  Finding the physical address of a kernel virtual address is
easy, and in fact we don't usually even need to do that, since
interrogating the page tables to find the user page's address in memory
gives us a true physical address directly.  Finding the bus address of a
kernel physical address is easy.

For block device IO, that's just fine: we either split up the IO or
submit it as a single block using scatter-gather DMA.

There are perfectly standard ways of doing this inside the kernel: the
macros to walk over page tables are already architecture-independent.

Indeed, and this is one of the problems I'll have to deal with for the
large memory support.  IO bounce buffers will be necessary, but that
will be entirely transparent above the block device request layer.
