I've just tried with another PATA hard disk over USB. Although there wasn't a BUG, I noticed this in the logs: 
Jan 14 23:04:34 lithium usb 1-3.3: USB disconnect, address 14
Jan 14 23:04:34 lithium udevd-event[17345]: unlink_secure: chmod(/dev/bus/usb/001/014, 0000) failed: No such file or directory
Which makes me wonder if you might be right in that it might be a problem with udevd.

After that message in the /var/log/messages file, I tried a couple of times, could not reproduce anything at all. I think that this probably is a udevd problem. But I do add that before I used the disks, I did run mkfs.ext4 to create the filesystem, and also a few fsck.ext4 runs, all of which completed without problems. 
I am currently running another rsync task with the disk at the moment.
