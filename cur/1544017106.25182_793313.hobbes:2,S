Ok, let's do it this way: Sascha has acked version 8 of patches 2 and 3. 
And there seems to be no active framebuffer maintainer ATM. So, maybe you 
could take patches 1-3 into your tree, so they are exposed to the public, 
people have easier access to them in case they want to test (I had several 
requests), and you update them in case you change async-tx API again:-) It 
would be good to try and push them in for 2.6.29 - these are new drivers, 
so, might still be possible to convince Andrew / Linus, if not, you could 
keep them in your tree (and in next) until 2.6.30, then we'd add platform 
bindings and the camera driver. What do you think?
Thanks
