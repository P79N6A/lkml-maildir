BTW, mainline sbp2 sets max_sectors=512 per default because one 1st
generation bridge needed it.  fw-sbp2 lets the SCSI stack chose the
default max_sectors, which is SCSI_DEFAULT_MAX_SECTORS i.e. 1024.
I think that should be fine with practically all SBP-2 bridges in
use today, but max_sectors > 512 was never widely tested.
