That posting was just a change proposal for the drivers/isdn/Kconfig
part, not a complete replacement for the entire patch. If you'd care to
reissue that patch with the modification I proposed, I'll gladly ack it.
Alternatively I can also send a full replacement patch if you prefer.
Regards,
Tilman
