> Some notebooks from HP have the problem that their BIOSes attempt to
> spin down hard drives before entering ACPI system states S4 and S5.
> This leads to a yo-yo effect during system power-off shutdown and the
> last phase of hibernation when the disk is first spun down by the
> kernel and then almost immediately turned on and off by the BIOS.
> This, in turn, may result in shortening the disk's life times.
>
> To prevent this from happening we can blacklist the affected systems
> using DMI information.

> Blacklist HP nx6325 that uses the sata_sil driver.
