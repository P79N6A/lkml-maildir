Maybe, depending on how easily kgdb cross compiles and how quickly I can
learn to use it...

In my case:
spurious_page_faults 0
cmpxchg_fail_flag_update 1359210189
cmpxchg_fail_flag_reuse 0
cmpxchg_fail_anon_read 0
cmpxchg_fail_anon_write 0
That number rapidly increases and so it looks like something is failing
and looping...
