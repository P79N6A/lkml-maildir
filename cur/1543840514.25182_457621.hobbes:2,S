It's already the case with idle=poll vs not.

Or better account for it using RDTSC because often people want their numbers to add up to 100%
when doing global accounting.  For other events than cycles=time it is not needed
because they don't happen by definition in idle.
This was one reason I added the hooks because it was a FAQ on oprofile
If you want them for i386 just send a patch to port them.
