Subject: [PATCH] 1/2 daemonize() calls reparent_to_init() cleanup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/9/3/265

Initialize child_reaper at idle thread entry: eg. ksoftirqd's PPID is
0, because it calls reparent_to_init() before child_reaper is
initialized.
Name: Early child_reaper initialization
Author: Rusty Russell
Status: Trivial
D: This sets child_reaper to the idle thread upon creation, so that
D: ksoftirqd's reparent_to_init call doesn't get the swapper as parent.
