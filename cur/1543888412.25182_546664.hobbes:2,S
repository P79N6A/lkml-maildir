Subject: [PROBLEM] 2.6.22-rc2 panics on x86-64 with slub

It's an AM2 5600 chip on AMD 690G chipset on Asus M2A-VM board.
With CONFIG_SLUB it panics. With CONFIG_SLAB all is well. (Same behaviour on
2.6.22-rc1 also)
Unfortunately, it panics so early, it doesn't make it to serial console. So
here's what I have written down (sorry if I missed some important info; I hope
it gives a clue or two):
Process swapper (...)
...
Call Trace:
    kernel_init+0x16c/0x2e1

RIP [...] slab_sysfs_init+0x49/0x98
RSP [...]
kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
The .config is attached (with the CONFIG_SLUB).
(It's vanilla 2.6.22-rc2 plus a patch, which is submitted to libata maintainer
already, from Tejun Heo for SB600 AHCI to work on a system with >4GB.)
Any patches welcome.
Thanks
