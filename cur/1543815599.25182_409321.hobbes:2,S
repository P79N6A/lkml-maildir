Yes, the testing is often frustrating and unreliable because the bug
is not 100% reproducible, which is why I think it's more than 1 bug
(one reliable bug, related to THM0, and one or more flakey ones).

Oh, I think you're right.  Robert Moore's comment at the bugzilla
entry agrees with what you say.  I was (I don't know why) assuming
that the ACPI system printed "Execute Method ..." after it finished
executing the method.  In which case, seeing the PTS but not the SST
made me think that PTS worked but SST failed.  However, what you say
is consistent with ACPI printing "Execute Method" as it begins a
method -- in which case seeing the PTS but not the SST means it fails
in PTS (and in PTS.SMPI).

You are stuck in the loop in the method below. I would guess that the
code is 
waiting for a response from the SMI bios and it never happens.
    Method (SMPI, 1, NotSerialized)
    {
        Store (S_AX, Local0)
        Store (0x81, APMD)
        While (LEqual (S_AH, 0xA6))
        {
            Sleep (0x64)
            Store (Local0, S_AX)
            Store (0x81, APMD)
        }
    }
    OperationRegion (MNVS, SystemMemory, 0x23FDF000, 0x1000)
    Field (MNVS, DWordAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
    {
        Offset (0xFC0), 
        S_AX,   16, 
    OperationRegion (APMC, SystemIO, 0xB2, 0x01)
