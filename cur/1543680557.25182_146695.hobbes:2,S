There are three species of quota in Linux
v0	(official old Linux)
v1	(most 2.4 vendor trees)
v2	(the 2.5 format)
[Plus other per file system stuff that is abstracted by the quota
updates and used by folks like XFS]
The v1 quota definitely doesn't belong in 2.5, but its needed by a
lot of 2.4 users who come from vendor trees (and may want to go back
again)
