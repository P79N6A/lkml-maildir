Thanks :)

The 64 bytes of data can be further tuned using the KALLSYMS_STEM_MARKS 
define.
Setting it to 16 instead of 8 will speed up the algorithm by _almost_ 
twice the speed. As the number grows higher, the speed up is less 
noticeable.

Ok, now that I know how it should be done, next time I'll add them myself :)
