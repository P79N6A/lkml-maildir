Another really good idea; all these papers and references to URLs of stats
utilities etc can be placed in linux/Documentation/references/*
It would be most excellent to have a generic text file filled with all sorts
of these references.  Even better to have several such files somewhat sorted
into various areas.
Being that these files are plain text and mostly URL references I think it's
easily acceptable to pad the kernel tarballs a wee bit more.
It'll be quite a treat to have a handy reference list of these critters much
like the URLs in the Changes/Configure.help.
