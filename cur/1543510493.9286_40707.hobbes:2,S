I think theory 2 _and_ 4 is the one.  I always had this problem too, until
I saw <someone>'s theory about the calls to DEBUG(), and ifdef'ed all
DEBUGs out of smbmount.  smbmount closes all of it's filedescriptors at
a certain stage, and therefore all later DEBUG()s will fail.  This is
with version 2.0.0.   After removing these DEBUG()s, I have had no problems.
