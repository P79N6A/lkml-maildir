Still hangs. :-(
How do I check that this option was passed through to the correct
place?
Actually, it only hangs if I have my Xircom combo Ethernet/28.8Kbps
modem plugged in when I boot or shutdown.
(actually, I haven't yet tried shutting down without the card yet.)
Also, even if I boot without the card in, and then insert it, the
Ethernet part works fine, however, the modem part doesn't. ie, the
modem is automatically detected and assigned to /dev/ttyS2 (strange -
normally it gets assigned /dev/ttyS3). However, programs like minicom
cannot communicate properly with it (no errors, just no comms).
This use to work fine with the 2.0.36 with and pcmcia-cs 3.0.5.

I have the latest pcmcia-cs (3.1.8) installed, and I am using the
latest pcmcia-modules source code. I am not sure if the problem is due
to me upgrading my kernel from 2.0.36, or from upgrading my pcmcia-cs
and pcmcia-modules. I am unable to compile modules for 2.0.36, as my
compiler is too new.
If I continue having problems, I will go back to 2.0.36 and pcmcia-cs
3.0.5 which seems to work fine.
