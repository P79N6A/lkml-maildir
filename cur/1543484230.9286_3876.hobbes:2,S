The list is set up and ready to go, as are 7 other lists
managed by majordomo@nl.linux.org:
  eulug-action            Activities to do with your LUG
  eulug-announce          Announcements of activities and projects
  eulug-devel             Development list (for programmers and gurus)
  eulug-help              Help list (for mere mortals)
  eulug-misc              Other discussions, fun URLs and the latest news
  kernel-doc              Linux kernel documentation; writers and users.
  linux-future            Future developments of the Linux kernel
  linux-legal             Legal aspects of Linux and Open Source
The EULUG lists are mainly of interest to European folks,
see <
http://humbolt.nl.linux.org/eulug/>
 for more information.
The other 3 lists are for a worldwide audience.
There are HTML-ized and normal mailing list archives available
from <
http://humbolt.nl.linux.org/lists/>.
Btw, if vger can set up the lists in a rather spam-free way,
I don't see a reason why this (smaller) server can't do the
same...
