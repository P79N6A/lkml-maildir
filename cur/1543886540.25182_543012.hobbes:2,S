You are partly right on the test however note that it is using a start
and len that are specific to the RDLCK so that should _only_ conflict
with that lock.  I did notice that the LTP test is taking a new lock on
the entire file which should be blocked by eithe rthe RDLCK or the WRLCK
and it doesn't check both, I plan on fixing that once this is resolved.
But, much more importantly F_GETLK is returning F_UNLCK saying that
there was no conflict at all.

True, this doesn't actually acquire the lock.  I have not tested to see
if trying a conflicting F_SETLK blocks as it should.  I will test that
later.  I missed lunch today so I won't get back to this until later
tonight or tomorrow....
