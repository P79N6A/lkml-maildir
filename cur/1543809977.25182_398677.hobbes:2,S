For the benefit of anyone searching later:
The problem was the current linux Marvell drivers (2.6.15/16rc4) not
detecting my Dlink card. After trying and failing to compile with the
linux driver (2.6.13-based) supplied on the retail CD (suprised, didn't
even think to look there at first!), I went to the Marvell site
directly and downloaded their version of the sk98lin driver, which
comes with a script to create a patch against whatever your current
linux version is in /usr/src/linux. That was found at:
http://www.marvell.com/drivers/driverDisplay.do?dId=107&pId=10
Yukon GigE Linux driver, Jan 12 2006, install-8_30.tar.bz2
After applying the generated patch against 2.6.15-ck4, I now have a
version of sk98lin that works with my DGE-560T.

I'll try the kernel sk* drivers again when >=2.6.16 is released.
A further note, neither the Yukon DOS diagnostics that came with the
card (v6.27.1.3), nor the newer diagnostics that I downloaded from
Marvell (v6.30.x.y) could properly detect my card. Kept getting the
error "Board register check failed". Just in case anyone might think
that would indicate a bad card, in my case it didn't. This was with an
Opteron 165 on an Asrock 939Dual-SATA2.
