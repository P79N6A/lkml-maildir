Similar error previously reported by me for 2.6.17-rc1, except sda got
added fine: error occurred when attempting to add/register sdb. 
Thankfully, you were able to append a trace...
I'll be trying the just-released 2.6.17-rc2 this evening.  Report to
follow, and if there's a problem, I'll attempt to provide the trace
(will have to be transcribed by hand, as system won't come up far
enough for syslog to capture anything).
