I find that if I: remember to empty the disk cache often, and run a
nameserver on my lan, that netscape 4.5 is rock solid.  It seems to
thrash badly whenever the disk cache starts to get full, or when
dns-helper has trouble using my ISP's nameserver (which is often
enough to make a caching nameserver a necessity for everything else as
well.)  It does not crash in either case, it just starts eating as
much processor time as it can get its hands on until I kill it.  Since
I started emptying the cache, I have had no trouble whatsoever.
Hope this helps.
