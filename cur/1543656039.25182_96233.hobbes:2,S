I just test your patch and IDE modules are working now on 2.5.51.
reiserfs, devmap and lvm2 are all working ... but the modules has
to be loaded in a certain order, otherwise the whole system would crash.
modprobe ide-mod
ide_info /dev/hda
--> this crashs the system
ide_mod looks for ide_hwifs, start_request, ide_do_request,
ide_do_drive_cmd, ide_diag_taskfile, ide_raw_taskfile,
taskfile_lib_get_identify, task_in_intr, proc_ide_read_identify,
proc_file_read, vfs_read, sys_read, syscall_call
modprobe ide-disk
ide_info /dev/hda
--> this works (ide-disk will load ide-mod first)
Under 2.4, I don't have to load the ide module first, calling fdisk
/dev/hda will automatically loads the ide modules, but under 2.5, I've to
manually load the ide modules.
Thanks,
Jeff.
