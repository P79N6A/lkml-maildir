What is the point of all this timeout business when starting/stopping
lockd? We sure as hell don't want lockd to survive us if we are the
process that is responsible for killing it, and neither do we want to
start locking if there is no lockd to handle callbacks.
Please see the example of rpciod in net/sunrpc/sched.c for how to do
this correctly.
As for the client changes to the GRANTED mechanism, where is
wait_for_completion_timeout() defined? It is not part of Linus' kernel.
Cheers,
  Trond
