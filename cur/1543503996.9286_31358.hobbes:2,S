Sure, but when, exactly, will you do this?  The condition I saw in your
latest SCHED_IDLE patches are insufficient for the long term.  Testing
the lock_depth is not good enough: there are large parts of the VFS
which now run without the kernel spinlock, but which can still hold or
block on other resources (eg. page locks).
