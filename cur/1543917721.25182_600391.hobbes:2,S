Yes that's the important thing.

The issue was moot because rulesets never get removed in the current 
implementation. I had missed that. If that ever changes RCU would be likely 
needed though.

I personally consider these IP options it uses to be pretty useless. Who could 
ever use that without cryptographic authentication? Clearly when they 
were designed in the original IP spec long ago the designers didn't understand
network security very well because the whole field was at its infancy. And 
CIPSO doesn't solve any of these fundamental issues.
It assumes a trusted network which is a very dangerous assumption.  I don't 
think that was in the original patch I looked at, I surely would have 
objected to it.
Perhaps take the network part out? I guess SMACK would be useful
locally even without questionable network support.
