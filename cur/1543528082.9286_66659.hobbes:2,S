I don't have a strong opinion either way on /proc/nzombies, but I am
certainly not convinced by this argument that it would cost too much.
Currently, the exit path always includes a for_each_task (in
forget_original_parent()). If the p_pptr/p_opptr stuff was rearranged so
that attaching a debugger to a process did not alter p_pptr (I think
Linus sugested something along these lines a few months ago for other
reasons), then this would not be necessary: The exiting parent could
just walk along its child list (processes without children wouldn't
even need to acquire the tasklist_lock). This would save far more
cycles than the atomic_inc needed for a zombie count would cost. 
Given the concern expressed in this thread for the exit path, I'm
surprised no-one has taken care of forget_original_parent().
