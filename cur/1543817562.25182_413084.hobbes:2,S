Hi Kyle.
Been watching this thread evolve for a while - and contributed a little
myself.
But I fail to find a rationale for the selected approach.
There are at minimum the following options:
1) Go through current set of headers and sanitize them - using
   __KERNEL__ to identify kernel only stuff.
2) Keep user space interface (KABI in your term?) in include/ and slowly
   move kernel specific definitions somewhere else. This has the great
   advantage to keep backward compaitibility.
3) 'Preprocess' include/ and generate a set of KABI files based on
   current set of (cleaned up) kernel header files.
   'Preporcess in '' because a C-preprocessor will not be sutilable.
4) Introduce a virgin KABI (your approach). The virgin KABI has no users
   today and does in no way preserve backward compatibility.
Can you try to explain why the virgin approach is superior to the
others.
