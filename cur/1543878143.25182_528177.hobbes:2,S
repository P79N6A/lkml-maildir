Subject: PROBLEM:  ACPI Thermal Zone for CPU0 does not update after      hibernation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

After hibernating, the CPU0 thermal zone never updates.  It will stay at 59C
forever for example.
I've tried making the thermal driver a module and unloading it before
hibernating and it didn't help, also went back as far as 2.6.19 and saw the
same behavior there.  Currently using 2.6.21-pre6.  If I reboot or suspend to
*RAM*, the problem fixes itself.  And CPU1's thermal zone is fine.  But CPU0
if it's (example) 59C, it stays 59C forever.  I'm seeing it in gkrellm, but
it's coming from /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/*/temperature and verified to match
there.
I'm using Fedora Core 6 on a Lenovo 3000 V100 laptop, custom kernel.  Still
modular, but stripped down to eliminate things that are not part of this
particular laptop.  All features work, suspend to ram and disk work fine,
sound, wireless, etc.  Just this quirk with the ACPI thermal zone crops up
when hibernating to disk.

Repeat for CPU 1.  Core 2 Duo T5500.  Kernel is SMP, both CPUs show, just not
pasting both for brevity.
I have turned ACPI debug on, here's copies of dmesg before hibernating:

And after hibernating:

Please keep me on the CC so I can respond to queries, as I am not on the
mailing list.
