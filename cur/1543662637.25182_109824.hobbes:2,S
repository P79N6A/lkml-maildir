Somehow all this idea has a feeling of long established
Linux kernel facility called:  netlink
It can send varying messages to userspace via a file-handle, and is 
pollable.  Originally that is for network codes, and therefore it
already has protocol capable to handle multiple different formats,
handle queue saturation, etc.
Do we need new syscall(s) ?  Could it all be done with netlink ?
