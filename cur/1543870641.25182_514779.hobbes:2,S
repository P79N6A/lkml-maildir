Using a zone-per-container or N-64MB-zones-per-container should actually
move us in the direction of *fixing* any such problems.  Because, to a
first-order, the scanning of such a zone has the same behaviour as a 64MB
machine.
(We'd run into a few other problems, some related to the globalness of the
dirty-memory management, but that's fixable).

Please send testcases.
