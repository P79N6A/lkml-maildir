OK.

Nope.
It would be interesting to run some simple benchmarks (dbench, iozone,
tiobench, etc) on a relatively idle system.
After that, it'd be a matter of searching through kernel versions, which
you presumably cannot do.  Or eliminating device mapper from the picture,
which is also presumably not an option.
Have you run `hdparm' to check that all those disks have DMA enabled?  I
guess they have.
