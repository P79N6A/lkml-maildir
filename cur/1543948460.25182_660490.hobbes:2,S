We should strive to minimize change in existing behaviour, especially
on points where either way could be arguably a reasonable choice in
some situations, and neither way is a clearly inescapable bug in other
situations.
One almost always breaks someone, somewhere with such changes.  You
need a compelling reason to do that, not just a "on this hand, on that
hand" design choice.
