Actually, I think you still can get the ability to do crazy inlining of 
the ROM code.  You have three exports from the ELF module:
vmi_init - enter paravirtual mode
vmi_annotate - apply inline transformations based on inlining
vmi_exit - exit paravirtual mode (required for module unloading).
But you can't require the ROM to be GPL'd.  It has to be multi-licensed 
for compatibility with other open source or, even proprietary operating 
systems.  If the ROM is licensed for use only under the GPL, then by 
including it in your kernel and allowing it to patch your kernel code, 
you leave your non-GPL kernel in a questionable license state.  If the 
ROM is licensed under an open license, with a clause allowing its 
inclusion into GPL'd software, then I don't think you have a problem.  
Course I could be wrong.  This is sort of a unique situation, and 
finding an identical comparison is tricky.
