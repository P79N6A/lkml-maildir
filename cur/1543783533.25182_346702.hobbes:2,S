These are not duplicate, TCP_NODELAY sender just starts flooding
tiny segments, and those are normal ACKs acking those segments, note
ACK field is not the same.

I still do not know how the value of 184 is possible in your case,
I would expect 730 as an absolute possible minumum. I see 9420 (2355*4).
Anyway, ignoring this puzzle, the following patch for 2.4 should help.
