How about the following - even more code simplification gained by this
approach :-)
I originally had the patch for removing the 'size' argument after a
patch (series) that made bi_size unchanged.   It seemed that patch
would face a harder path upstream so I re-ordered them and missed this
dependency.  Mea Culpa.

I must have missed something ....
I've seen:  A fix for a bi_end_io in jfs that I missed.
            A correction for that fix ("return 0" was remove instead
               of just the '0' removed)
            Some fixed for code that is only in -mm (which I didn't do
              because I thought you wanted it against a non-mm tree).
I think it was definitely ready for merging in -mm.  Possibly not for
mainline just yet.
