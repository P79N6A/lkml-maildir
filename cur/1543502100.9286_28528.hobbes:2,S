Hi,
We are having serious problems with EATA drivers under Linux 2.2.5
and 2.2.7, especially in SMP kernel. We tried eata_dma and eata
drivers. Neither will work with SMP. For eata_dma, we got
eata_dma: trying to reset HBA at 0150 to clear possible blink state.
HBA at 0x0150 does not react on INQUERY. Sorry.
in SMP kernel. The same hardware seems to work when booting with UP
kernel of the same kernel version. With different 2.2 versions,
sometimes UP kernel will panic with NULL point reference.
Does anyone have any EATA drivers working with 2.2 and SMP?
Thanks.
