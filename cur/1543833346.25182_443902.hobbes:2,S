furthermore, cache_free_alien() is a NOP on non-NUMA, so the cost on 
non-NUMA is really small.
but ... i think gcc ought to be able to figure out that the parameter is 
totally unused on !LOCKDEP - all functions involved are static, and we 
are using -funit-at-a-time already. That should make the parameter 
passing totally zero-cost.
