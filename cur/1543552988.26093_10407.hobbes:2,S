Ok, sync_page() looks like a broken design, but I suspect that for
expediency the simplest fix is to just make the NFS sync_page() (re-)check
for "mapping == NULL", and let it be at that. Avoid the NULL pointer
dereference (very small window already).
We should probably in the long run make "page->buffers" be a more generic
thing, and let NFS use it as a wb-info thing, and be done with it. That's
obviously not 2.4.x material, though.
