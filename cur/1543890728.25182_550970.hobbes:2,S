Richard,
Do you think it makes sense to split the driver (and Kconfig options)
between input and leds directories as Jan had done? I know that I
prefer to keep anything input related in input directory because it
makes my life as maintainer easier and I bet you prefer the same but
it does not always work well for multifunction devices or devices
using several subsystems...
