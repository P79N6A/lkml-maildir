If the test machine and a 2nd machine have FireWire ports, it's possible
to get the kernel log and more via FireWire, unless the machine rebooted
immediately or the PCI bus locked up.  The program 'firescope' and the
raw1394 driver is needed on the 2nd machine; the test machine has to
have ohci1394 loaded.
