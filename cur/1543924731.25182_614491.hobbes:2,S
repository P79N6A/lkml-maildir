So you are having RAID5 problems as well?
I'm struggling to understand what possible changed in XFS or writeback that
would lead to stalls like this, esp. as you appear to be removing files when
the stalls occur. Rather than vmstat, can you use something like iostat to
show how busy your disks are?  i.e. are we seeing RMW cycles in the raid5 or
some such issue.
OOC, what is the 'xfs_info <mtpt>' output for your filesystem?

At this point, can you run a "sync" and see how long that takes to
complete? The only thing I can think that woul dbe written out after
this point is inodes, but even then it seems to go on for a long,
long time and it really doesn't seem like XFS is holding up the
inode writes.
Another option is to use blktrace/blkparse to determine which process is
issuing this I/O.

Well, the patches I posted should prevent blocking in the places that it
was seen, so if that does not stop the slowdowns then either the writeback
code is not feeding us inodes fast enough or the block device below is
having some kind of problem....
Cheers,
Dave.
