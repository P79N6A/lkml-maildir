I'd like to get another patch in here before going upstream if possible.
It is not a correctness fix, but it is a bit of a rework.
I also wouldn't mind getting the readahead path, if not the full
pagecache readside, out from under tree_lock in -mm kernels to exercise
the radix-tree concurrency a bit more.
It's just been painfully slow, recently because of these more important
buffered write vs deadlock and pagefault vs invalidate problems that
I've been working on. I don't feel I can load up -mm with too much
unrelated stuff that messes with mm/pagecache internals.
I guess the per-cpu spinlocks are pretty reasonable for scalability,
and you are mainly looking to eliminate the lock/unlock cost in your
interrupt path?
