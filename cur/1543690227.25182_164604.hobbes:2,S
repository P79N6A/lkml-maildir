   does this include the fix to make it possible to use >137GB drives 
with SCSI_ATA? (I think that's libata5 patch)
   (I have intel D865PERL, maxtor 250GB SATA drive used with SCSI_ATA 
kernel config option, currently use 2.4.21-ac4 (for SCSI_ATA) + libata5 
(for 137+ GB support) patches)
   TIA,
