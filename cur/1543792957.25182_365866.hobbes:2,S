That's strange; first the datasheet is pretty much useless; it does
not even give you product ID ("refer to documentation"). Then it
claims this device supports CFI. I guess it is easier to get the
values from sharp.c than from this datasheet :-(.
[It seems like the chip has many "options", and it is up to user how
it uses the chip.]
