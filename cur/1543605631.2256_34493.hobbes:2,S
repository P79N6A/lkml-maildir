A video driver has to have extremely good latency, syscalls are overhead that
you generally do not want. There are specific things you want kernel help
with - agp management (and thus AGP DMA), context switching on DRI and maybe
some day interrupt handling for video vsync events and wiring them into
the XSync extension.
The rest is a bit questionable as a kernel space candidate, but if you 
want it in kernel go ahead - XFree86 supports both models.
