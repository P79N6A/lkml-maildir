Subject: kernel oops (triggered by dnetc?)

I've been noticing 4 kernel oops this night, and have no previous
experience of kernel oops. I believe the trigger was dnetc
(distributed.net) as the fist oops occurd a while after starting the
client.
I have turned dnetc off now.
I noticed that only two oops got logged, and that no information about
registers isn't available.
My processor is a pentium 100, not overclocked but running without a fan.
The system has never befored oopsed, and I have been running 2.2.13 since
the kernel was released.
