Unfortunately the oops text you sent cannot be used for debugging.
Please send the oops that 2.6.12-rc6 produces to the list (ksymoops is
not necessary on 2.6.x kernels and should not be used!). 
Depending on how early the oops happens you can definately use
Documentation/serial-console.txt and maybe the somewhat simpler
Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt
Please send the non-ksymoopsed oops you wrote off the screen when
booting 2.6.12-rc6
Thanks
