I think it should be ignored for suspend-to-RAM as well; even if a 
device or two is consuming unnecessary power, it's better than not being 
able to suspend at all, causing more things to consume unnecessary power.
At most, a warning should be issued so the user knows what's going on, 
and can choose whether to suspend to disk instead (or choose to complain 
to the device manufacturer).
