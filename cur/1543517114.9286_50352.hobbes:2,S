Your proggy hangs immediatly on UP no matter if using the locked bit set
or the movl. I am not sure if this is expected yet (but after a fast read
I can't see anything that depends on the hardware to be SMP in your
proggy). Hmm...
The UP hang is at least a bit suspect and worth checking IMHO. (work in
progress...)
You can boot with the "nosmp" param to try it out yourself if the reason
is not obvious to you as well. If it's obvious please let me know of
course ;). thx.
