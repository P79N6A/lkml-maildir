  This sounds like a good idea. To call the raw AML methods from
User space, just need to solve the problem of argument passing.
But, some AML methods are risky to be called directly from user space,
Not only because the side effect of its execution, but also because
it could trigger potential AML method bug or interpreter bug, or even
architectural defect.  All of these headache is due to the AML method
 is NOT intended for being used by userspace program.
Thanks,
