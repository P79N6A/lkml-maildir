FWIW, I had this problem with late 2.5 kernels
on my 8.0 boxes - after upgrading to RH 9, the
xscreensaver unlocks properly when running
2.5 kernels -
Apparently the xscreensaver shipped with RH
9 contains the fixes - perhaps needed for their
kernel which contains backported 2.5 features?
Smarter folks than me may know more...
