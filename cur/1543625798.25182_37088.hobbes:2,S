Can you try the patches at:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=101684196109355
and also:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=101684207509482
And let us know if they help you out?
If not, try renaming 'usbmodules' on your box to something else (like
'usbmodules.orig' and seeing if that solves your problem?
thanks,
