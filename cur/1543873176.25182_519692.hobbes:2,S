The frequency tracking you mention is done to some extent inside the
timekeeping adjustment functions, but I'm not sure it's totally accurate
for non-timekeeping, and it also tracks things like interrupt latency.
Tracking frequency changes where it's important to get it right
shouldn't be done I think ..
If you want accurate time accounting, don't use the TSC .

The sched_clock interface is basically a stripped down clocksource..
I've implemented sched_clock as a clocksource in the past ..

Are there other architecture which have this per-cpu clock frequency
changing issue? I worked with several other architectures beyond just
x86 and haven't seen this issue ..
