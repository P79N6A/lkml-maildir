Yes, since 2.5.26.

No, I fixed that problem. But, as I told you:

[Maybe I forgot to tell you; I am a mathematician; tend to be
fairly precise; thus, the above precisely describes the state
of my knowledge yesterday evening: in the category "USB-induced
oopses at reboot" one bug was fixed in 2.5.26; there are further
such bugs still present in 2.5.27; concerning 2.5.29, it does not
get far enough to decide: the usb-storage module hangs initializing.]

(Concerning this BUG_ON in transport.c: it should be commented out
for the moment. First of all, nothing is wrong, I think, and secondly,
we know already with certainty that it will happen, so nothing is learnt.
Matt simultaneously came with some SCSI patches. More or less reasonable,
although discussion was possible. But these were not applied in 2.5.29.
If and when these or similar patches have been applied to the SCSI code
one may consider enabling this BUG_ON again.)
(I have not yet looked at the BUG at scsiglue.c: 150.)
