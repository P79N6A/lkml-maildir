As pointed by Paul Jackson in a reply, what we are trying to get is a
list of pids, which can be termed as vectors and doesn't need serious
parsing, but simply separating the items in the list by a '\n'.
What I was trying to do in the patches is to remove some code (which
maintains its own buffer) by an existing mechanism, seq_file. 
As Andrew pointed in one of the email, my patch set reduces the number
of lines of code in configfs also.
You do not think that is a good idea ?

I thought the mantra is "Use existing infrastructure, instead of writing
your own".

I do not think we were/are. As you pointed we did have our own file
system. And as I mentioned, we moved to configfs mainly to reduce code
size and to start using the existing infrastructure.
Same is true even for the (cpuset extracted) patch set submitted by Paul
Menage. It does have its own file system. I was advocating him to use
configfs for the same reason (to use existing interface).
