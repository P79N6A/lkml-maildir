Greetings all;
Has something been changed recently, say post 2.6.19, that would effect 
this error from k3b when I click start (the burn), with a fresh dvd+r in 
the drive:
--------
Using growisofs 7.0 Copyright (C) Andy Polyakov <appro@fy.chalmers.se>
Starting writing...
:-( unable to anonymously mmap 33554432; resource temporarily 
unavailable...
Fatal error at startup, resource temporarily unavailable...
--------
And k3b then ejects the tray.
Selinux is disabled.
Currently booted kernel 2.6.21-rc5

Cheers, Gene
