Srivatsa, Dinakar and/or Nathan,
If the version of this patch that I posted:
	Sat, 14 May 2005 10:44:29 -0700
	Message-Id: <20050514104429.7dc92c85.pj@sgi.com>
with the comment change, and the code change:
 	/* No more Mr. Nice Guy. */
 	if (dest_cpu == NR_CPUS) {
-		tsk->cpus_allowed = cpuset_cpus_allowed(tsk);
+		cpus_setall(tsk->cpus_allowed);
is one that any of you have tested, and if you agree with it, then with
an "Acked-by:" reply (to that patch), it should make sense to recommend
it to Andrew for inclusion in his and/or Linus's kernel.
I'm still happy with it.  My understanding is that you all are ok with
it as well, and I just need to push it over the finish line.
