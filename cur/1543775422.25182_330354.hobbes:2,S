Absolutely. 2.6.12 and 2.6.12-git9 crash within
minutes/seconds; OTOH, 2.6.13-rc1 (plus Hugh's patch)
survives this torture test for hours (despite
generating 30+ MB of kernel/IDE error messages :). No
OOPS, no BUGs, no panics, just truck load of error
messages.
I haven't tested whether earlier releases of 2.6
suffer from this (such as 2.6.10, 2.6.11 ..) or other
hardware combinations exhibit the same problem etc.
Tell me, if you want me to.
Thanks
Hari
