0000_00FD_FC00_0000h - 0000_00FD_FDFF_FFFFh On a hypertransport based
system should work.  There is a 32MB window for it.
However the I/O vs mem distinction doesn't matter anyway if we start out
per bar because we already know if it is I/O or mem.

Well the other alternative looks like having a second file per par
bar.  Say resource0_wc to support the write-combining mode, possibly
restricted to just prefetchable bars.
If that is all we have to worry about my inclination is to suggest
a second file, because that feels a bit more generally useable.  As
that attribute could be applied to ordinary reads and writes to and
from the bar.
