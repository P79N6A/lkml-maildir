Can you enable the NMI watchdog? It could be a PCI bus lockup (in which 
case nothing will help), but if it's some interrupts-off busy loop 
(whether due to a spinlock deadlock or due to the driver just spinning) 
then nmi-watchdog should help.
Of course, that requires that you have support for local/io-APIC (ie if 
UP, please select CONFIG_X86_UP_.*APIC)
