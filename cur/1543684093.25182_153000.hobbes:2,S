I have a system with 4 SCA drives.  Originally they were:
/dev/sda -> scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc
/dev/sdb -> scsi/host0/bus0/target1/lun0/disc
/dev/sdc -> scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/disc
/dev/sdd -> scsi/host1/bus0/target1/lun0/disc
SDA drive was hot-pulled to test the raid failover and it worked great.
Next the box was rebooted after the drive was replaced (these systems
can hang or go real stupid when a drive is pulled).  The drives remapped
as was expected.  When it came back up the sd? entries had shifted up 1
as expected
/dev/sda -> scsi/host0/bus0/target1/lun0/disc
/dev/sdb -> scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/disc
/dev/sdc -> scsi/host1/bus0/target1/lun0/disc
and when the drive was put back in it came up as sdd.  Other than a
reboot is there any known way to get the drives back in the proper
order?  Killing devfsd, removing the entries and restarting, etc didn't
do any good.
