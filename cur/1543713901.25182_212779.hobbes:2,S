That's right, at present it's just something in Andrea's -aa tree
and Martin's -mjb tree.  Will try to remember to copy maintainers
when sending to Andrew.  But the problem was there before the patch.

Don't be afraid, that's good!  Is it still going vertically down
i_mmap_shared and i_mmap?  Whereas it's only interested in vmas of
the one mm, so could go horizontally along it.  Just an option to
play with, but I don't believe it solves anything, just as unsafe
when threaded.

Yes.

Which we're not giving you at all at present.  I guess another layer
of spinlocking/nopreemption, for parisc and arm, dissolving to nothing
on other arches.
