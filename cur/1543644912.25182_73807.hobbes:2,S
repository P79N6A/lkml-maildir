Yes, EDD would be oriented toward storage devices.

It's optional in the USB CBI spec.  It's not even mentioned in the
USB UFI (floppy) spec, and USB floppy drives that I've seen do not
have it.  It's not listed as optional in the USB bulk interface
storage spec, and my Zip drive and USB hard drive do have serial
numbers.  At any rate, it cannot be depended on to be there.

| Um, what do you mean, "right way"?  All USB devices do not have any such
| serial number.  Only a very small minority of devices contain a kind of
| serial number, and that field is a string (and often times it is not
| even unique, unfortunately.)
|
