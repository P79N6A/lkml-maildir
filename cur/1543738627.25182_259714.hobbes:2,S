And see, this is where I say, what if /dev is hosed too? If the kernel at this 
point gives up, then the user has to dig up a boot CD or something worse and 
start trying to fix the system.
If, however, the kernel just made /dev/console and maybe /dev/null, it could 
start a shell and say "/dev missing /console device, initrd corrupted. Hit 
enter for a shell or ctrl-alt-del to reboot."
As a sys-admin, I'd like that. Get me into single user mode the best you can. 
If a shell can be found, that's good enough.
