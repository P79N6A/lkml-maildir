Why is the video RAM area marked busy in the following code from
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c?   (from 2.3.18)  IMHO video driver really
needs to make this decision.    For now I am gonna have to hack around
this in vga16fb.  vgacon probably needs resource code too.
Also, are 'kernel code' and 'kernel data' do not appear to ever be
marked busy.  Bug?
static struct resource ram_resources[] = {
        { "System RAM", 0x000000, 0x09ffff, IORESOURCE_BUSY },
        { "System RAM", 0x100000, 0x100000, IORESOURCE_BUSY },
        { "Video RAM area", 0x0a0000, 0x0bffff, IORESOURCE_BUSY },
        { "Kernel code", 0x100000, 0 },
        { "Kernel data", 0, 0 }
};
For that matter, should video ROM be marked busy too?  Some video cards
move that space to allow for accels where the video ROM usually lives.
Regards,
