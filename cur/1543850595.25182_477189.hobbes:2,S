OK, so I tried adding all of them to the HID_QUIRK_IGNORE LIST, i.e.
#define USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_GEYSER_ANSI 0x0214
#define USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_GEYSER_ISO  0x0215
#define USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_GEYSER_JIS  0x0216
#define USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_GEYSER3_ANSI    0x0217
#define USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_GEYSER3_ISO     0x0218
#define USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_GEYSER3_JIS     0x0219
    { USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_GEYSER_ANSI, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE },
    { USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_GEYSER_ISO, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE },
    { USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_GEYSER_JIS, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE },
    { USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_GEYSER3_ANSI, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE },
    { USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_GEYSER3_ISO, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE },
    { USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_GEYSER3_JIS, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE },
    { USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, 0x020E, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE },
    { USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, 0x020F, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE },
    { USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, 0x030A, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE },
    { USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, 0x030B, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE },
however this did (and cannot) work, as the product id stands for both
keyboard AND mouse. 
It will however work for the internal infrared receiver (which is also
affected).
#define USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_IR  0x8240
{ USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_IR, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE },
Could someone please add this to the quirk list in hid-core.c in git ?
Please note that one can even do this from userspace via
        libhid-detach-device 05ac:8240
        modprobe appleir
Anyways, back to the above problem. Can one somehow tell the hid-core to
load the appletouch driver when it detects any of these devices and then
initialize on top of that ? The appletouch driver is completely ignored
(doesn't even enter the atp_prope function as usb_register registers
with device/product tuples that are already taken by hid....
Any ideas ?
