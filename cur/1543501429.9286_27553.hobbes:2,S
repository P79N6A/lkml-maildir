Hi!
> open("/etc/", O_RDONLY) then, I don't get your point.
But what do you think ls does when listing directory?
stat("/etc/", {st_mode=0, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
open("/etc/", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK)      = 3
fcntl(3, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)           = 0
brk(0x8055000)                          = 0x8055000
And ls would probably be very unhappy if it got some kind of
index.html file instead of listing.

Why is it better than user doing open("/etc..body") directly? Or
open("/etc#body") for that case :-)
