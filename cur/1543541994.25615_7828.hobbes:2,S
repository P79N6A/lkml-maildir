Are you talking about the Zorro bus that Amigas use? If so, what
architecture besides Amiga-m68k uses it? Is it for PPC?
Why does that belong into drivers/$ARCH? arch/$ARCH/drivers is fine, and
you can symlink it around if more than one architecture shares a certain
piece of hardware.
Plus, drivers should be separated from abstraction layers. Things get
unmaintainable otherwise.
