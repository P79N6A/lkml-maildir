We have seen those memory allocation failures already with 2.6.7, crashing our 
server every morning on doing its cron daily cron jobs, so this is certainly 
not only an issue since 2.6.9. Unfortunately that time nobody seemed to be 
interested in my bugreports... Finally we had to switch back to 2.4.27, 
though it is much slower as fileserver.
