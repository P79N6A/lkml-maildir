unfortunately i cant speak for whether or not this patch is
reengineering the work of altroot (i have no experience with it) or
whether there are other similar approaches.
what i can say is that this is an excellent idea -- i have often cursed
having absolute symlinsk v. relative ones and this option would provide
a wonderful fix to that.
plus, i bet this is a rather simple and clean option.
i would like to see this in the kernel if it does not tread on any other
similar feature.

for sure.
