scalability, mainly.  If the CPU holding the lock takes an interrupt,
all the other CPUs get to spin until the handler completes.  I measured
a 30% reducton in contention from this.
Not a generally justifiable trick, but this is a heavily-used lock.
All the new games in refill_inactive() are there to minimise the
interrupt-off time.
