I think it's probably a hardware issue, yes.  I've seen several Maxtors
doing just this kind of stuff before ... I have one @ork which gives
this kind of errors if I put the box sideways - if it stays upright, no
problems :)

Well, have you tried setting 32-bit support to '0'?  Just for hdb,
first, if that doesn't help, for hda and hdc also.
It happened to me on one machine (486 also, just one Quantum) but
inexplainably sometimes.  On other occasions all is well.
