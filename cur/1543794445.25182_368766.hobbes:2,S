Just for grins, try displaying which cpu each thread runs on.  Display the
return from "latestcpu(getpid())" in the two per-thread printf's, to display
the thread's cpu at the beginning and end of each compute_thread().  Perhaps
you will notice that the per-thread cpu correlates with the test times.
