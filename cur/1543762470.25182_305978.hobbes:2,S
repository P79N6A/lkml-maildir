 We have users of scsi_do_req() other than scsi_wait_req() and they
use different done() functions to do different things.  I've checked
other done functions and none uses contents inside the passed
scsi_cmnd, so using a dummy command should be okay with them.  Am I
missing something here?
 Oh, and I would really appreciate if you can fill me in / give a
pointer about the scsi_request/scsi_cmnd distinction.
 Thanks a lot.
