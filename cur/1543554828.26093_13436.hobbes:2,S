   Ted, is this true? It would be wonderfull to be able to use i82365 without
   need for pcmcia_cs...
   I think in-kernel pcmcia crashing even on simple things *is* critical bug.
It was Linus who said that Pcmcia crashing wasn't necessarily a critical
bug since 2.2 didn't have Pcmcia support in-kernel, and that for 2.4, it
was likely that most distributions would be best served to ship with
David Hind's external pcmcia driver.
That was several months ago, and perhaps things have changed.  But that
was I didn't spend time worrying about tracking PCMCIA bug reports;
there were a non-trivial number of them, and they were mostly of the
form "doesn't work on XXX hardware", "causes kernel oops on YYYY
hardware", etc.
