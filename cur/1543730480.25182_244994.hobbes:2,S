I agree, that would be my personal preference as well. Stick to what's 
currently done with the -rc, -mm etc patches - make x.y.z.2 be based on 
x.y.z, much easier on users. 
Also, the x.y.z.N patches are also most likely going to be pretty small 
even if diff'ed against x.y.z, so why burden the user with having to apply 
a series of patches?
