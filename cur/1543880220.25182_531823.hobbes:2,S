Is it? In an environment with automatic domain transitions and
socket based administrative interfaces I can easily imagine how
an incorrect or incomplete policy definition (or even one containing
an ill advised regular expression in a pathname) could result in
a user being able to get inappropriate service from an application.
Maybe I am being silly. I am part of the generation that treats
the setuid bit gingerly, and one of the people who worked to see that
the POSIX capability mechanism was appropriately careful. The notion
of applications flipping their security contexts about based on
externally specified rules in an environment where communications
with potentially privileged processes are covered by another set
of those rules does not inspire confidence. I think that those rules
had better be very carefully defined for them to be worthy of trust.

OK, if it make you feel secure, that's fine. It doesn't do anything
for me.

But ... in a targeted policy SELinux isn't controlling all accesses, either.
Well, there's really no point it making further arguements. I don't
expect to get through where I've failed before. And SELinux is still the
best type enforcement scheme available, so if you like that sort of thing
it's a fine choice. I still don't think that the arguments against path
based access are particularly compelling.
