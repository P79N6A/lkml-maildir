yep you are right - i only thought in terms of applications that know that
they are dealing with a network.

i believe BSD's TCP_NOPUSH should add those 3 lines that are needed to
flush pending packets, this is what we do too - we do a
tcp_push_pending_frames() if the socket option TCP_CORK is cleared.

yep - i agree now. In terms of network-aware applications, i found
MSG_MORE to be both cheaper and less bug-prone - but for uncooperative (or
simply too generic) applications which are output-ing to simple files
there is no way to control buffering, only some persistent mechanizm.
