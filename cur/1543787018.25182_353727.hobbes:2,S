Hi, Grzegorz. Thank you for your response.

The southbridge is a VIA VT82C686.

Humm, cables. I forgot to check that. I will check that as soon as I  
wake up. I spent the entire night trying to fix this, but of course,  
I gave up after some days of effort and decided to ask for help.

Nothing in the logs. No oops, no stack trace, no nothing. :-( Oh, now  
that you mention it, I remember that I also made my Matrox G400 use  
speed 4x. I will try slowing it down to see if there is any influence  
on what I see.

I don't know, because lmsensors doesn't give accurate measurements,  
unfortunately. :-(

I had already tried using memtester, but I guess that I was too  
ambitious with the amount of memory that I tried it to allocate. I  
will try this, but with my filesystem in read-only mode, as I cannot  
afford to loose what I have (and Debian's mondo/mind isn't working  
right now---I already filed a bug report that is shared by others).

I already checked each module separately, but I didn't see any  
corruption. I guess that I maybe wasn't paying too much attention. I  
will try it again. Thanks for the suggestion.

Yes, I was just trying to avoid getting a new system now, with all  
the transitions going on (i386 -> x86_64 CPUs, PATA -> SATA etc). But  
my time is also costing me some nights of sleep... :-( It sucks not  
to be in the US, where things are cheaper. :-(
Thank you very much, Rogério.
