Did you dream that up or did you read it somewhere? If the latter, where?
All operations are done by "dedicated hardware" and microcode DOES modify
that hardware, or rather the way instructions are "digested". So, applying
microcode doesn't make anything slower per se, it's just replacing one
code sequence with another code sequence. If a new code happens to be
slower than the old one then of course the result will be slower, but the
reverse is also true. When you fix a bug in a particular software why
should a bugfix be apriori slower than the original code? Think about it.
So please do not spread misinformation that applying microcode makes 
something slower. If anything, it should make things faster, as long as 
the guys at Intel are writing the correct (micro)code.
Kind regards
Tigran
