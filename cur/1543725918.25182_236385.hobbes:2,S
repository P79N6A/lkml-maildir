From what I understand now, this exploit is solely based on the weakness of 
dm-crypt's/cryptoloops IV generation. 
The difference in bit patterns between the first and second half of the 
watermark block compensates partly for the trivially and predictably changing 
IV beetween two successive sectors.  
As Jari eplained, this causes *any* cipher to produce two identical blocks of 
ciphertext (after all the input is identical). 
This is also, why this exploit requires a minimum filesystem block size of 1kB 
for good reliability.

If my understanding is correct, an improved and unpredictable IV generation - 
- as needed anyway for the vulnerability described at 
http://clemens.endorphin.org/OnTheProblemsOfCryptoloop
 - 
*should* protect against this watermarking as well. So both problems can be 
fixed together and rather easily.
