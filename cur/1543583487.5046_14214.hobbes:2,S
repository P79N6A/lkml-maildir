Same problem on sparc64.  Using a special PCI syscall is fine, _if_ we
all end up using the same one.  However, I would prefer another
mechanism...
I think a cleaner scheme is to allow mmap() on
/proc/bus/pci/${BUS}/${DEVICE} nodes, that is much cleaner and solves
transparently any "different word size between userland and kernel"
issues (specifically 32-bit userlands executing on 64-bit kernels).
I played around with something akin to this, and some of the necessary
Xfree86-4.0.x hackery needed, some time ago.  But I never finished
this.
