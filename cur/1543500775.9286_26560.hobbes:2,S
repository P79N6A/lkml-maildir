Scsi disks except #2.
Computer 1: adaptec aha-2940U quantum 8.4gb scsi
Computer 2: ide, 420mb wdc
Computer 3: adaptec aha-2940U micropolis 2.0gb scsi
> Swap space (free)?
Computer 1: 64mb swap total, usually 5mb used (256mb physical ram)
Computer 2: 20mb swap total, usually 10mb used (64mb physical ram)
Computer 3: 100mb swap total, usually 10mb used (256mb physical ram)
> Did you modified the Makefile for SMP builds (MAKE=make -j 3)?
Computer 1: make -j 20 dep;make -j 20 zImage modules
Computer 2: make -j 10 dep;make -j 10 zImage modules
Computer 3: same as computer 1
> Are you sure you have all CPU enabled (cat /proc/cpuinfo)?
Definately.
> Are you running a SMP kernel (cat /proc/version)?
Definately.  Using 2.2.7 on computer 1 and 2, 2.2.10 on computer 3  Which is
really irrelevent, I've used 2.2.1 - 2.2.10 on computer 3 and it has always
taken 20+ minutes.
