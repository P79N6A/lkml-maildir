Here's the latest report (all on latest git):
	1) I've switched to AHCI mode and suspend/resume works OK (because SATA
controller irq is not disabled).
	2) now /proc/interrupts look like that:

Disabling IRQ #19
This might happen due to "ACPI: EC: GPE storm detected, disabling EC GPE", but
here it should revert to polling mode (which is done during boot, but not during
resume). I'm not expert here.

PS: Site note: Why there's such big difference on hdparm timings with PATA and
AHCI mode?
