Well that's with a noyield patch and your sched_tick fix.

No, I don't think 1/6th is being left for X in the ccache case so I
think there's a bug lurking here. My memload, execload, and forkload
test cases did better even with X niced.
To confirm, I've just run 15 instances of memload with unniced Xorg
and it performs better than make -j 5 with ccache.
If I have some time tomorrow, I'll try to do a straight -mm1 to mm2
comparison with different loads.
