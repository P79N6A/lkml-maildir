OK, sorry for my confusion.  I still don't see why rcu_read_lock_sem()
is segregated, but it will clearly work either way.

The one that I am aware of has not yet hit mainline -- Kaigai Kohei's
scalability changes to Linux.  See:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109628285418353&w=2
The function avc_update_cache() does an rcu_read_lock(), then
invokes avc_update_node(), which acquires the update-side lock.
No problem under conventional RCU, in the case where one might
realize that an update is needed during what is a read-only search
in the common case, but would be problematic given real-time preemption.
						Thanx, Paul
