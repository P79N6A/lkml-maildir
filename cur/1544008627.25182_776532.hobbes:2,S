indeed. you raise the more general question of what do if both 'DEBUG'
and 'CONFIG_DYNAMIC_PRINTK_DEBUG' are set for a file? I think that in
general the 'DEBUG' should take precedence, as you point out. However, I
think we should fix this by reshuffling the logic in
include/linux/kernel.h by doing:
if (DEBUG)
	#define pr_debug printk
elseif (CONFIG_DYNAMIC_PRINTK_DEBUG)
	#define pr_debug dynamic_pr_debug()
else
	#define pr_debug if (0) blah:
endif
make sense? what do you think?
thanks,
