Other than the write-back caching, it's not an open-loop system, 
right?  Regardless of how commands are batched or queued, isn't there 
some acknowledgment back from the drive that some batch of commands
(or some command, or some part of some command) was completed?
Surely the kernel checks for such acknowledgments, right? 
DMA-complete interrupts are probably how some of those acknowledgments 
are communicated, right?
So if the kernel doesn't get an expected DMA interrupt, it should
know that some command(/batch/part) wasn't acknowledged successfully,
right?  And surely it can tell _which_ command/batch/part wasn't
acknowledged (if multiple ones can be outstanding), right?
So if some command/batch/etc. wasn't acknowledged, why can't the 
kernel retry the command/batch/etc.?

Given the serious of disk data corruption, why isn't the Linux kernel
more reliable here?  Hasn't this family of IDE problems been around
for a couple of years now?
