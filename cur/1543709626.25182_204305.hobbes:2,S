I believe that's not the only problem with binfmt_elf.  If the total address
space described by the PT_LOADs is not exactly one contiguous interval, then
2.6.3 binfmt_elf fills in the gaps with 'prw.' of zero-filled pages, instead
of the intended "holes" with no mapping at all between isolated PT_LOADs.
