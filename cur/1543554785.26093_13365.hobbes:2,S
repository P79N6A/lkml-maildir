One idea the Dell folks suggested is walking the SMBIOS data table. That happens
to be something I want to do as its the only good way I know to get
	o	Cache sizes on older machines
	o	The type of monitoring device (lm78 etc) attached
	o	slot information
I have user space code to walk these tables so I have a basis to attack this
in 2.2.19
