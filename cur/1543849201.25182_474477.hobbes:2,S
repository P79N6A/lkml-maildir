No. They can put a cpuset there all they like. But the cpuset code
should *not* put a partition there. That is all.

Well it is the correct flag if we only create the domain for the
oldest ancestor with the cpu_exclusive flag set. From the documentation:
   "A cpuset may be marked exclusive, which ensures that no other
    cpuset (except direct ancestors and descendents) may contain
    any overlapping CPUs or Memory Nodes."
It is this non overlapping property that we can take advantage of, and
partition the scheduler. Obviously, the exception (from the POV of the
oldest ancestor) is its descendents, which can be overlapping. So just
don't create partitions for those guys.
