It seems that intelfb can't change it no matter what....booting with 
video=intelfb:1024x768-16@60,mtrr=0 gives me the usual vga console and 
no framebuffer. The following is printed during boot:
[...]

agpgart: Detected an Intel 855 Chipset.
agpgart: Detected 8060K stolen memory.
agpgart: AGP aperture is 128M @ 0xe0000000

intelfb: Non-CRT device is enabled ( LVDS port ).  Disabling mode switching.
intelfb: Video mode must be programmed at boot time.

On the other hand, the vga=0x318 gives a 1024x768 console (and the vc 
<-> X fight) with the following messages during boot:
[...]

(I tried X in 1024x768-32bpp after seeing the messages from the vga=... 
boot but the problems remained)
Suggestions?
