    Bad idea... ;))) I upgraded my 'mount' yesterday. I was using a
mount from Debian, from 1998 more or less, that worked flawlessly
except for the '--bind' feature and things like those. I used
/etc/mtab as a symlink to /proc/mounts, and all worked OK except for
the double root entry and the need to manually call losetup to delete
unused /dev/loop entries.
    But after the upgrade I no longer could umount a filesystem that
I mounted as 'user', because the device is a symlink and the 'user'
option is not stored in /proc/mounts. So my problems were:

    Exactly!!! I will add the double root filesystem entry (one from
the device, the other one being 'rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0'). Until all
these problems are solved, is not a good idea to remove /etc/mtab :(
    I have another issue with a chroot environment I have, which has
its own copy of proc and devpts mounted. Those appear in /proc/mounts
twice, but not in /etc/mtab (they appear in the /etc/mtab copy of the
chroot env).
