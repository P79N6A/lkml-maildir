Alan, please apply this patch to 2.2.14.
This is against 2.2.13 (I think) but applies cleanly to all 2.2.14pre1[0-2]
at least.  I'll try it against pre16 as soon as I have a chance to get a copy.
This patch appears to be trivially correct, as it follows the pattern
of other scsi_free calls.
Without this patch, aha1542 always causes a kernel panaic during scsi reset.
With this patch, scsi reset sometimes never occurs, and always recovers.
(There is also a mailbox leak, but I don't know if it is related.)
If you don't apply this, please explain to me why.
