I don't know when this started (maybe it has been there forever...), but
you can't losetup(8) a loop device from a file on a tmpfs. [Yes, I _know_
this is an idiotic thing to do. But uniformity is nice...]
Here (Red Hat 7.1 + new kernel + random patches), /tmp is tmpfs, and
mkinitrd(8) won't work for this reason, so kernel upgrades fail.
Any fundamental reason for this behaviour, and should RH just use /var/tmp
or something else? Or is this a simple oversight of some sort?
