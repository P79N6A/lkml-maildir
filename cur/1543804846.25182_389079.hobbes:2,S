In this case we're only waiting for other iterators to move past our 
struct device.  The fact that next_child isn't refcounted doesn't matter, 
because (thanks to the new klist_remove) it won't go away until we're done 
with it.
I suppose a different approach to fixing this would be to make klist_del
and klist_remove check the value returned by klist_dec_and_del, and have
_them_ call the put method (after the spinlock has been released) instead
of having it called from klist_release.  Would you prefer me to change it
that way instead?
