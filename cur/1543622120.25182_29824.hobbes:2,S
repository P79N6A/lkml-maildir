That, and adding some code in drivers/ide/via82xxx.c,
  { "vt8233c", PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8233C, 0x00, 0x2f, VIA_UDMA_100 },
is right now ifdef'ed out, and the entry for the vt8233a, which is
  { "vt8233a", PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8233A, 0x00, 0x2f, VIA_UDMA_133 },
in 2.5.2, is missing (and there is no UDMA_133 in 2.4).
Right now I am running a 2.4.18-pre9 with a slightly modified
drivers/ide/(timing.h|via82xxx.c) from 2.5.2, and it works with
my vt8233a and an UDMA-100 disk, but this is of course not a 
conservative change. Maybe the patch by Vojtech Pavlik mentioned
in the message I referred to above is less radical.
Yours, Florian.
