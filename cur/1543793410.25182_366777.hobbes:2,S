Another intriguing observation:
If I do my file copy test from files that are already cached,
then the data usually gets committed to disk more or less
right away.
If the copy is done from uncached files, then the data usually
does not get committed to disk until I "sync" or run the
posix_fadvise test program on it.
Anyone else seeing this?    2.6.15-rc1, x86, 2GB
