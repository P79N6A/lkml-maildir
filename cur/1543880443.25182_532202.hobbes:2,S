Subject: [PATCH 0/2] wistron_btns: small fix and led support

Hello,
The following two patches are against the input tree and improve the 
wistron_btns driver.
The first patch is mostly trivial, it fixes a typo that I introduced in 
the previous batch.
The second patch adds led support to the driver (and therefore also 
dependency on the led class).
See you,
Eric
