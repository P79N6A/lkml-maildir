We're using the 1.4 GHz Athlons (non-MP) in a Tyan S2460 with no problems.
Check some reviews, such as from Tom's Hardware or AnandTech to see some 
specifics regarding the use of non-MP processors in SMP mode. It definitely 
is possible and it works fine, but check those websites for details from 
someone who knows a heck of a lot more about SMP than I do.....     : )
