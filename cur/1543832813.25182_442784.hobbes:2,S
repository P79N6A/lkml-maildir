The timer interrupt is re-enabled, via the timer_sysclass::resume hook,
while the timekeeping code is re-enabled via the
timekeeping_sysclass::resume hook. The issue being that I'm not sure
there's a defined way to specify the .resume calling order.
The timekeeping_suspended flag is a bit heavy handed, but I think it
might be the safest bet (assuming Mikael finds it works for him).
