Since x86-64 time handling is not overflow-safe, these are the
adjustments needed for allowing debuggers to update time after
having halted the system for perhaps extended periods of time.
Note that this depends on the HPET definitions adjustments, which
aren't in 2.6.14, but have supposedly been merged already into 2.6.15.
