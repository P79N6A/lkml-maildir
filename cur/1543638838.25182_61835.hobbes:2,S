The EEPROM (SEEPROM) on these NICS is used to contain the startup
configuration bits and the IEEE Station Address. This must be a
unique number that is assigned so that there is no other such
number in (preferably) the world, and certainly in the LAN.
If you let a user write to this area, you will allow the user
to destroy the connectivity on a LAN.
If you provide an ioctl() to write new SEEPROM contents, it had
better be disabled in code that user's (any, including root)
can execute because, if caught, your company may lose it's IEEE
Station Addresses and never again be allowed to configure Ethernet
Controllers.
Because of this, there is no such thing as 'unused eeprom space' in
the Ethernet Controllers. Be careful about putting this weapon in
the hands of the 'public'. All you need is for one Linux Machine
on a LAN to end up with the same IEEE Station Address as another
on that LAN and connectivity to everything on that segment will
stop. You do this once at an important site and Linux will get a
very black eye.
