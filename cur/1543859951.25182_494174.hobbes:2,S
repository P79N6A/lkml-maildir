Hi,
With the recent ACPI merge I get this in dmesg:
ACPI: EC: evaluating _Q60
ACPI: EC: evaluating _Q60
ACPI: EC: evaluating _Q60
[...]
and similar warnings. Also I am not completely sure but sound skips when I get 
this warning. Anyone experiencing the same problem? Also why does ACPI is 
polluting dmesg like this?
Regards,
ismail
