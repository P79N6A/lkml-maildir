Oh yes they are.  Libc info for "Why Block":
   Temporary blocking of signals with `sigprocmask' gives you a way to
   prevent interrupts during critical parts of your code.  *If signals
   arrive in that part of the program, they are delivered later, after you
   unblock them.*
And sigpending(2):
   The sigpending call allows the examination of pending signals (ones
   which have been raised while blocked).  The signal mask of pending
   signals is stored in set".
