A fourth possibility is some sort of signal, which makes sense in a way --
do we want the application to a) ask if there is a new device, b) wait for
a new device, or c) be notified that there is a new device? It wouldn't be
hard (I think) to write a callback function for the USB handler that an
application can register with (i.e. a signal). It seems to me that option
c) is the best, since it maps to the bus behavior best.
