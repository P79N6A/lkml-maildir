They were already decoded... Also others reported that - after accessing
/proc/ide/ide0/hda/identify system dies... I believe that passing
hand-created request to ide_raw_taskfile corrupts drive->free_req,
and so subsequent drive command after this cat finds that 
drive->free_req.next is NULL and dies.

I expected that too, but I thought that unexpected interrupt may
have something related with this. Strange. I'll try to find some 
better identify parser than my eyes.
