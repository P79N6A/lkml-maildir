Yes, I tried very hard to accomplish this myself, it would be
wonderful if it could be made to work.  I tried tricks using __label__
in inline asm, everything.
It would be workable if condition codes could be passed into inline
asm statements somehow, or the address of the builtin_trap() could
be reliably obtained.
