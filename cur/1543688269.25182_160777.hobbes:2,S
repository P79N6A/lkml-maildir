Q for the specialists: What SCSI access can still work then? I'm 
wondering if you can still write something to it. My first guess about 
that vender tool was that it just writes a valid partition table to the 
disk. The only problem is that you need to deduce the actual size of the 
flashdisk. But that can be retrieved from some USB identification string.
But it's more likely that it just uses some propriety interface to reset 
the device.

You can use USB Snoopy <

 to find 
out what that vendor tool (for Windows, I presume) does.
