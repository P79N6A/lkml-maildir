Yes, definitely.

Yes, I feel it's important to have a filename that strongly states the
dim view its contents take on its subject (the "volatile" type
qualifier in this case). Sort of like stable-api-nonsense.txt vs
stable-api.txt

I'm not so sure here. Why would any C programmer (worth his weight in
salt) think that volatile objects are automatically _atomic_? At
worst, the mistake someone might make would be to _implement_ locking
primitives using volatile. "that the variable could be changed outside
of the current thread of execution" sounds sufficient to me, and after
all, that is exactly what volatile hints to the compiler.

Yes, this addition would be nice :-)
