Hi Nikita,
thanks for your comments.

No, I think it's difficult to throttle total Dirty+Writeback only with
write_chunk, because write_chunk just affects Dirty and Writeback of
each device (in this case, throttling is done in write-requests queue of
the each backing device, as I said in another mail).
Throttling of the total Dirty+Writeback should be also done in VM itself,
and to control that, I added `dirty_limit_ratio.'

As far as I can see, adjustable ratelimiting is the actual cause of the
long wait on writing to disk with light load.
I think removing adjustable ratelimiting should be done in another patch...
