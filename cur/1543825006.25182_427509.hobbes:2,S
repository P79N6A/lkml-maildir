Sorry, the lower 8 bits are for ra_class values in the new code. It can
cause data corruption when dynamic switching between the two logics :(
I'd like to change the flags member to explicit ones like
        struct {
                unsigned miss           :1;
                unsigned incache        :1;
                unsigned mmap           :1;
                unsigned no_lookahead   :1;
                unsigned eof            :1;
        } flags;
        unsigned class_new              :4;
        unsigned class_old              :4;
Reasonable?
