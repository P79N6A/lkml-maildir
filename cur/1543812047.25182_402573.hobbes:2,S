Nvidia hardware SATA cannot directly DMA to > 4GB, so it 
has to go through the IOMMU. And in that kernel the Nforce

is theoretically capable.
Maybe VMware pins unusually much IO memory in flight (e.g. by using
a lot of O_DIRECT). That could potentially cause the IOMMU to fill up.
The RAID-1 probably also makes it worse because it will double the IO
mapping requirements.
Or you have a leak in some driver, but if the problem goes away
after enlarging the IOMMU that's unlikely.
What would probably help is to get a new SATA controller that can 
access >4GB natively and at some point update to a newer kernel
with newer forcedeth driver. Or just run with the enlarged IOMMU.
