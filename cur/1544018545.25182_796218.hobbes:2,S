You did explain your solution.  The problem you are trying to solve was
not clear to me.  It may be my mistake.  If you have the stack
information, what can you do that you couldn't do without?  Notice
overly large stacks and fix the application?  I would guess so, but you
surely know better than me.

True.  The comment was not about removing them completely but moving
them where they hurt less.  When I'm reading through some generic code
and I read something like this:
	f->f_pos = 0;
	f->f_op = fops_get(inode->i_fop);
	file_move(f, &inode->i_sb->s_files);
	error = security_dentry_open(f);
	if (error)
		goto cleanup_all;
I only get slightly distracted by the security_dentry_open() that I
personally may not care about one bit.  Much nicer than having this:
	f->f_pos = 0;
	f->f_op = fops_get(inode->i_fop);
	file_move(f, &inode->i_sb->s_files);
#ifdef CONFIG_SECURITY
	error = security_dentry_open(f);
	if (error)
		goto cleanup_all;
#endif
See the difference?

Fair enough.  So assuming I wanted to reduce or limit stack consumption,
what would I do with this information.  I know the responsible process,
but not the callchain.  kill -QUIT 12345 would give me a core dump and I
could analyse that.
Is that what you try to achieve?  I was only guessing and may have
missed a more important point.
