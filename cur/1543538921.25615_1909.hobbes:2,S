As a "compatibility" issue, I would recommend that you include
"compatmac.h", and that compatmac be augmented with:
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < 0x20400
#define OLD_MOD_INC_USE_COUNT MOD_INC_USE_COUNT
#else
#define OLD_MOD_INC_USE_COUNT /* Nothing */
#endif
and similarly a construct for the lock_kernel. 
This prevents the ugly inline #ifdefs . It's not as clean as
completely removing them, but in my opinion, it will do for the time
being. (We squashed a bunch of bugs yesterday by porting over the 2.4
driver for a card to 2.2. If compatmac will allow the source file to
be identical that'll be even easier in the future. Now we have to 
handle the modcounts every time.)
