Much easier, plain C, no special tools:
   include/linux/...
   include/asm/...
   include/glibc/...
where .../glibc/xyz.h contains the shared parts, and the others feel
free to include that as needed.
The real problem is that the interfaces _do_ change, as new syscalls,
ioctls, and constants show up (so "one set of .h for userland, cast in
stone for all eternity" won't _ever_ do), and that parts of the userland
are tightly bound to the kernel, and _need_ inside knowledge (strace, the
tools for manipulating modules, ...). Plus glibc and userland also
changes...
