And hence CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT became unused.
Subject: [PATCH/RFC] Remove obsolete CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT
commit 8308c54d7e312f7a03e2ce2057d0837e6fe3843f ("generic: redefine
resource_size_t as phys_addr_t") made CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT obsolete, but
didn't remove it. Remove it.

Although sometimes I'm longing for the days I could hunt for "warning: cast

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
