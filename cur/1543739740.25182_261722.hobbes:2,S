Ah, I'm not the only one! Apparently not all obvious fixes for things that got
obviously broken in 2.6.9-rc* were applied :-(
Not to mention e.g. the m68k signal handling got broken because of the removal
(without any warning in advance on linux-arch) of notify_parent(), which is BTW
still used by 5 archs, either in code or in comments (never trust comments?).

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
