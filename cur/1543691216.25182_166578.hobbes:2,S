That seems like bug ;-). Can you do some kind of memstat to see if it
is not something like atomic pages shortage? Also try to run vanilla
kernel. And try running it UP.

I'm afraid I do not have big-enough box close-enough to fix that.
Does it happen with another disk driver, too? What about interrupts,
are not they disabled for too long? Can you enable PREEMPT to see
'scheduling in atomic' warnings?
