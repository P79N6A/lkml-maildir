> I try 2.4test4 with test5pre3 patch and find problems
Can you verify it with 2.4.0-test4 (or -test5-pre2) ? There
was change in -test5-pre3... I tested it with 8859-2 and UTF8
codepages, but maybe I screwed something. Can you show me
your fstab entry or ncpmount cmdline?

Strange. What namespaces you have loaded on server's volume? And
how you configured ncpfs options in kernel config? You should either
correctly configure Netware server with your codepage or use NFS namespace.
Otherwise server will use (in default config) CP437 for case insensitive
name compare. This can lead into fatal results.
Also, ncpfs in 2.2.x only upper/lowercased 'A'-'Z','a'-'z'. In 2.4.x
it correctly uppercases small russian 'z' to uppercase 'Z' and so on...
I'm almost sure that something of this causes your troubles.
Try 'ls -l' instead of KDE. Also try adding '-o ttl=10000' to
ncpmount cmdline.

Did not you select 'Lowercase DOS filenames' ?

What is it 'closed directiries' ?

Can you send me names of such directories? Preferrably as hex codes in
server encoding ('nwdir -v -t /dir/with/problems | od -t x1' and
'nwdir -v -t /dir/above/one/with/problems | od -t x1').
I'm using ncpfs everyday, either with 'codepage=cp852,iocharset=iso8859-2'
or with 'codepage=cp852,iocharset=utf8'.
