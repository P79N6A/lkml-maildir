There isn't as far as I can tell. The CodingStyle document doesn't
mention a preference for any form or the other, nor does Greg's talk
about coding style. This means that you are free. If anyone wants it the
other way and is brave enough, he/she can submit an incremental patch
for Greg to consider and see how Greg receives it ;)

And I'll defer to Arjan's myself. As said in another post, no other i2c
client driver does use snprintf. If there is no good reason for them to
do (and actually I don't see any) let's stick to sprintf for everyone.
If there is, then we shall fix all drivers, not only adm1026.
Thanks,
