Subject: mmap() return value when length == 0

hello,
on linux (2.4.9 and 2.2.18), the mmap() syscall will return NULL if the
length argument is 0 rather than returning MAP_FAILED (-1).  this is
different than both solaris and hp-ux, and the linux man page doesn't
indicate that it should do this.
so, is this indeed the desired behaviour or a longstanding bug?
thanks,
jacob
