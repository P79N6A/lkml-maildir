Ok, that was a bit rough. Sorry.
At the same time though, we were talking about new drivers. If you know
enough to implement the rest of the driver, surely you know enough to
implement the power management part too. (See my previous comment about
the similarities to module load/unload code).

I agree.

Not necessarily. I dual boot our desktop machine, and hibernate both,
using grub to select with OS to run.

Neither am I. I'm just asking that new drivers have power management as
standard.

Yes, but why should the user have to complain to start with?
