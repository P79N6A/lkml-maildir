It's likely either
 - a mirroring issue (the git.kernel.org server is _not_ the main one I 
   push to, so it can take a while, and if some objects haven't made it, 
   the upload side will exit because the repository isn't "valid" until 
   the full mirror has happened)
 - too many clients trying at the same time
In this case, I suspect the latter.
