You have a lot of pr_debug and other printk() for stuff in this driver.
Please use dev_dbg(), dev_err() and friends instead.  That way you get a
consistant message, that points to the exact device that is causing the
message.

You have some big inline functions here.  Should they really be inline?
We aren't really worried about speed here, right?  Size is probably a
bigger issue.

Is this header file really needed?  Does any other file other than this
single driver ever include it?  If not, please just put it into the
driver itself.
