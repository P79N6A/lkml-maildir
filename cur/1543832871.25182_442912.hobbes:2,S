Hmm.. in my understanding, all structures for *possible* cpus are allocated
at boot time. Then, only problem seems that a cpu is tied to 
not-exisiting-node at boot time.
(see arch/ia64/kernel/numa.c, build_cpu_to_node_map())
====
void __init build_cpu_to_node_map(void)
{
        int cpu, i, node;
        for(node=0; node < MAX_NUMNODES; node++)
                cpus_clear(node_to_cpu_mask[node]);
        for(cpu = 0; cpu < NR_CPUS; ++cpu) {
                node = -1;
                for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; ++i)
                        if (cpu_physical_id(cpu) == node_cpuid[i].phys_id) {
                                node = node_cpuid[i].nid;
                                break;
                        }
                cpu_to_node_map[cpu] = (node >= 0) ? node : 0; 
                if (node >= 0)
                        cpu_set(cpu, node_to_cpu_mask[node]);
        }
}
=====
Then what we have to do here are
1. remap cpu to the first existing node at hot-add event
or
2. implement node-hot-add triggered by cpu-hot-add.
   Because we already have implemented node-hot-add triggered by memory-hotadd
   we can do it by small effort.
I think above will work for your environment.
do you have any idea other than "don't remove empty node at boot time" ?
or reserve empty node is the best way ?
