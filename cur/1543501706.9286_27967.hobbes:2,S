Well, I already responded to this. Streams _are_ being used now.

Actually, this brings to mind a mistake that Microsoft made.
NTFS supports OS/2 extended attributes _separately_ from the
multiple data stream support.

Nope, multiple data streams give Microsoft:
1. good performance with large compound documents
2. something to wound Samba with
3. justification for the Windows upgrade
The second two reasons are evil. The first two reasons will hurt us.

No. The operating system formerly known as NT 5 will be using an
updated NTFS on the Vertias LVM. On factory-installed systems,
there won't be a PC partition table. (think of how Microsoft
introduced FAT32 in Windows 95 OEM releases)
The new NTFS adds reparse point support. This solves the compatibility
problems with multi-stream files. We can stop arguing how to solve the
problem, because it has already been solved and the solution will be
used on office networks everywhere.
