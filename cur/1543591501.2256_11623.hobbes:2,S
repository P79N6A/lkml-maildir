The flag idea, or some equivalent way for the low-level driver to 
communicate to the multi-pathing level, seems exactly right. I'm 
guessing that provision needs to be made for some 
external-device-dependent means of signalling both failure and 
recovery. There are potentially side-channel/out-of-band means to 
communicate this kind of status from specific devices.
