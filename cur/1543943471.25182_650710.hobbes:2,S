Indeed, a page on kernelnewbies.org with the most important repositories
would be helpful.
Well, to start:
torvalds/linux-2.6.git	Mainline
jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git	Network devices
davem/net-2.6.git	Networking
x86/linux-2.6-x86.git	x86
mchehab/v4l-dvb.git	V4L and DVB
bunk/trivial.git	Spellos, typos and the obvious
But it's not that easy. netdev-2.6.git for example regularly gets merged
into net-2.6.git, so you get a fairly recent netdev tree by choosing
either netdev or net.
