Hmm, although I like madvise (but was told that the kernel is better to
fine tune read ahead charakteristics based on disk speed etc), I must
admit that this interpretation is a really odd misuse of the madvise
function which is intented for speed optimizations only, not to remove
mappings or have any semantic effect at all.

I think in any normal situations you could just unmap the region and map
it again. Or actually just mmap a new region over the old.
But I see you've a special need here: I assume your real problem is that
there are two processes sharing a memory region and one of them wants to
dealloc any buffers used by the region for optimization. And just
unmapping and mapping does not help because all processes would have to do
that.
You could have the sending process shared mmap a new area and pass on to
the recipient(s) it's location and then, through some usgae counters, all
procs unmap it again.  But I see your concern about too many OS calls and
interproc communication. 
I think you always have a filedescriptor for such shm games, so an ioctl
on the file does add no real new syscall (which also has C-library
implications) and is odd enough to scare people using it except when they
really, really need it. 
Well, just my 0.02$
Michael.
