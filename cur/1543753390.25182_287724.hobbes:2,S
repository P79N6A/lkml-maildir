I would argue that "name of gcc has changed" is possibly a condition
that does more harm than good.  It is just as frequently used to have
wrappers, like distcc, as it is to have different versions.
(FWIW, nothing is more obnoxious than having the kernel tree blown
away when you try to compile in the one missing driver needed to talk
to the rest of your distcc cluster.)

I say unconditionally do make install, but there really, REALLY, need
to be a way to override this check manually.
