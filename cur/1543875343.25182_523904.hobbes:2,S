[ This was not a request for UBI to be changed.  The only purpose was to
illustrate that LogFS is not broken.  The previous thread suggested
otherwise and I just couldn't leave it at that. ]

Or you could have a table and any number of updates to it.  Erase one
block, append a small update marker to the table.  There are plenty of
options.  All have in common that code would be more complicated.
Another advantage is that erase counts don't get reset if the race
against a power failure during erase is lost.
Whether the advantaves of power-of-two blocksizes and safe erasecounts
are worth it, I leave for others to decide.
