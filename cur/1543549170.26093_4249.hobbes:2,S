because the 2.2 kernels are already "broken" in this regard, i can't see
how binary compatibility between 2.2 and 2.4 could even be an
issue.  applications can't use this stuff in 2.2 without at least the
RedHat patch.
unless there's a problem implementing a glibc that runs on both 2.2 and
2.4, perhaps this should be revisited.
also, the test at issue here (from line 363 of kernel/signal.c):
                /* If this was sent by a rt mechanism, try again.  */
                        if (info->si_code != SI_USER) {
                                ret = -EAGAIN;
                                goto out;
			}
has always been unclear as to its intent.  it seems like there is
overloading going on here -- if the real intent is to prevent users
without credentials from sending "kernel-only" signals, then that should
be the logic here.

we just published a paper in the ALS proceedings describing our
implementation of a new system call similar to sigtimedwait() that
collects many events at once.
