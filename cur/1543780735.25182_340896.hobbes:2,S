Sorry for the late follow up. Well, the timer management in Windows
depends on the HAL used. By default, it's the ACPI HAL that is used in
this laptop.
I did re-install Windows by forcing the "Standard PC"  HAL in Windows
XP installation and, without ACPI, Windows exhibits the exact same
problem as Linux or any other system: The clock runs 3 times too fast
in Windows too...
So my guess is that the HAL ACPI in Windows does more or less the same
thing that does my patch (updated, available here:
http://www.xfce.org/~olivier/r3000
), it calibrates the PIT timer based
on the ACPI (PM) timer.
Cheers,
Olivier.
