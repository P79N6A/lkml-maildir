That "check /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe" thing is a way of detecting whether
you are on a kernel that uses kmod or not. If you are on 2.1.90 or later,
then you do not need to start kerneld at all. If /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe
exists then you are on 2.1.90 or later, and use kmod, so don't start kerneld.

Add these lines to your /etc/modules.conf (or /etc/conf.modules if you use
that. It makes no difference.):
alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp
alias ppp-compress-24 ppp_deflate
alias ppp-compress-26 ppp_deflate
alias ppp-compress-1 off # This is Predictor-1, not yet supported

That's stuff like slhc and bsd_comp and ppp_deflate. They get built
automagically for you when you enable PPP.

I hope that was the information you needed. :)
