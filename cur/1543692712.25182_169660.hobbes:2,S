Hmm.   I guess that's possible, but will be somewhat intrusive in 
do_page_fault()
Also you have to be very careful to avoid recursive faults (EIP unmapped) 
recursing further. In the original patch I did that for kernel mode by always
checking the exception table first to catch the __get_user in __is_prefetch
early.
Maybe it would be better to just use a down_read_timeout().
