When doing a google search on logfs, there are less than five results
among the first 100 that don't refer to your work. The other two listed
in there are also log-structured file systems: The inferno flash file
system (
http://inferno-os.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/liblogfs/
) and the
(discontinued) file system named lfs from the 2005 google summer of
code.
I'd say the name should stay, changing it now can only add more confusion.
