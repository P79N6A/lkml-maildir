You don't consider me a luser, right?
Okay, and I *did* need unrm few times. Few examples:
/dev# rm sbpcd *     (simple typo, recovered by immediate powerdown + fsck)
/big$ mp1enc > samotari.mpg (oops, I did it twice, second time by mistake, and
		powerswitch was too far away to make it in time)
So yes, unrm is usefull. And it would be even more usefull if it recovered
truncated files, too. How many times did you do > instead of >>? I did that
mistake many times, its just easy..
