   	It works here and applies both to 2.4.15-pre* and 2.4.13-ac*.
   Please, test - it's pretty straightforward and if there is no complaints
   I'm submitting that for inclusion into the tree.
I like this patch but I would change one thing.
"start,next,stop" sound like global kernel helper functions, not PCI
SEQ specific helpers, why not name them pci_seq_start et al. instead?
That pci_devices list does need locking, particularly with the PCI hot
plug stuff in the tree now.  But PCMCIA could already change the list
after boot too if I'm not mistaken.
