I'm not sure what you mean by faster, burning runs at device limited
speed in CPU time in the  less than 1% range if you remember to enable
DMA. The last time I looked DMA didn't work in either kernel if write
size was not a multiple of 1k, (or 2k?) has that changed?
I'm not sure what you meant by faster, so don't think I'm disagreeing
with you.
