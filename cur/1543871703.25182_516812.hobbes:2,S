Subject: [PATCH] [GFS2] Fix bz 230143, incorrect flushing of rgrps
The below patch fixes a problem where we were not flushing rgrps
correctly. It only occurred in the specific case that a callback was
received for an rgrp which was dirty and when a journal log flush had
not already resulted in the rgrp being flushed anyway. This fixes Red
Hat bz 230143,
