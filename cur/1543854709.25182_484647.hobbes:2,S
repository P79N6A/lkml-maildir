Alright, you're kernel hackers.  But I'd like to take issue with the mindset
that these drivers are your burden, to bear by yourselves.  It seems to me that
anyone with an iPaq relies upon this code path, or one like it, so you are
supporting a bunch of users by yourselves, and holding up the burden of
compatibility with the mainline kernel at the same time.  Doing twice as much
work, on two moving targets.  That's the waste of time.

And here's where the recommendation to get your code into mainline comes in.  If
the kernel developers don't know that you're using something, they can't tell
you what it was replaced by, or even that they need to replace it with anything.
 "No mainline users of the code" is a reliable baseline for value, because we
can't go looking for out-of-tree users in any convenient way.  Therefore nobody
tells you it's going to break until you learn the hard way that it broke, and
holler at the list.  Nobody *can* update you.  It isn't malice, it's finity.  If
your code is in mainline, whoever makes a change to mainline has to care,
because there is a legitimate burden of compatibility assurance, and it isn't
yours alone any longer.

I could be wrong, but it doesn't sound like Evgeniy is complaining that this
problem hits him.  The other drivers in w1/slaves don't use find_bus().  He's
offering to give you an export to hook into.  Though I might also look at
Dmitry's suggestion and rework around driver classes.  Which may fit in with
what Evgeniy says about moving the driver model out of w1.
