A laymans thought here. As ioremap was done for bd->type < PCIXEM, so
iounmap should also be done for the same case.
But as you see the function is void and not handling errors, so this
change can have side effects... well.. it can misbehave even without
this change in the failure case..

I think module owner should take responsibility for this. One more
example of badly coded driver is drivers/char/cyclades.c. I was not at
all able to do ioremap balance with iounmap for this one.
