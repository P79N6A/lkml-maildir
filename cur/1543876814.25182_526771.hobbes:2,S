Please dont focus on /sys being your holy gral.
1) AFAIK /sys/devices/system/cpu was not designed to meet glibc needs.
2) Many production machines dont mount /sys at all
$ uname -r
2.6.20
$ ls -al /sys/devices/system/cpu
ls: /sys/devices/system/cpu: No such file or directory
$ grep processor /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
processor       : 1
