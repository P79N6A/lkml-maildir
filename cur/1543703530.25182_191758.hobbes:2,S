Mike,
	Sorry about the bad description. I have a logitech MX500
mouse that uses the explorer protocol. When i boot -mm4 the
scroll wheel is broke. When you try to scroll with the mouse wheel
the cursor moves all around the screen instead of scrolling. This was fixed
in 2.6.0 by adding psmouse.psmouse_proto=exps to the end of my kernel line in
grub.conf. It also was working in 2.6.1. For some reason it won't in
2.6.1--m4 though. Thanks.
-Greg
