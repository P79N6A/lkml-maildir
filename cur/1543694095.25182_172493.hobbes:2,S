Hearing this is about the happiest I can be to be proven wrong.

"$FOO is cheap" is a copout for sure; in the wrong country or for the
wrong people the limitation to "performant" hardware is a lethal blow
to usability. I'm not sure how to say how glad I am to hear of a direct
attack on this issue.
If you and/or your cohorts could inform us of kernel usability issues,
especially with 2.6, I would be much obliged (all the more so for a cc:).
