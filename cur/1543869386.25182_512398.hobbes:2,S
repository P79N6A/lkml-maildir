Hi Nick
Thats a really good idea !
The vmalloc() thing could be a problem, so :
Could you bring back the support of 'dhash_entries=262144' boot param, so that 
an admin could set the initial size of dhash table, (and not shrink it under 
this size even if the number of dentries is low)
In case dhash_entries is set in boot params, we could try to use 
alloc_large_system_hash() for the initial table, (eventually using Hugepages 
(not vmalloc)), if we add a free_large_system_hash() function to be able to 
free the initial table.
Or else, time is to add the possibility for vmalloc() to use hugepages 
itself...
