The piece of the puzzle you're missing is that the read() function really did 
used to do something, and was relied upon.
If you want to go right back to prehistory, the drm was originally designed as 
a "core + personality" system, where the core supported a number of different 
context switching mechanisms to cover a variety of hardware cases.  The gamma 
driver exercised one path, but everything since then has been a lot more 
simplistic, assuming that the hardware state is lost if another context has 
been active.
Hardware often has the capacity to hold multiple active contexts or to perform 
fast hardware context save & restore.  None of the DRI drivers have attempted 
to take advantage of that - optimization continues to focus on the 
single-client scenario.
A future X-on-GL world where regular applications are presumably doing direct 
rendering will change that assumption...
