Same here. 3 computers with PIIX4, 2 (or maybe even 3, need to check the
850M Conner too) different disks (all pre-udma but mwdma, 2.5G Seagate
Medalist and 850M WD Caviar). The common denominator seems to be PIIX
chip (PIIX3 and PIIX4 reported so far) and multiword DMA.
It came with 2.4.19 for me - 2.4.18 (and thus also Debian Woody) is fine
but anything with a newer kernel (incl. 2.6.*) is broken - DMA timeouts.
So maybe it is a little different (since your 2.4.20 works) but still
very similar.
