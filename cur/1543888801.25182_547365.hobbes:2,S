I am posting links to the information you asked for. One more thing, after 
digging a bit more I found its QoS shaping that is making the box crawl. Once 
I disabled the traffic shaping everything comes back to smooth and normal. 
Shaping being done on very low speed residential ADSL 256/64 Kbps connection.
If you want me to post shaping rules, please free to ask. BTW its a simple 
HTB/SFQ rules.
