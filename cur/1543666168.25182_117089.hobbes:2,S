This would require the full data, I looked at it and neither the CVS tree 
nor the Web interface has everything.
- the changeset ids are missing, if bk does its renumbering thing 
ids in comments become useless
- complete changesets are missing, RCS is quite capable of branches, so 
there is no need of merging patches into a single patch.
- merge information is missing, e.g. what branch was merged into which 
changeset.
I attached an example RCS file, how that could look like. I had to guess 
the merging information and tags are missing.
It would be really useful to have this information as well.
