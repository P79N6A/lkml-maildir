Subject: suspended X -> dead console

One user has hit this occasionally:
1. startx
2. switch back to text console from which startx was executed
3. ^Z (X suspends)
4. Alt-F7 (to the console where X lives)
console is dead at this point (2.2.11). kill -CONT over net helped it.
Would something like this patch be useful? (completely untested yet)
