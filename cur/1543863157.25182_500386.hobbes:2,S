mmap maps some offset down a backing object to some virtual address
in userspace, for some length.  When the backing object is itself
memory, what would you use for the offset down that backing object?
For physical memory (/dev/mem), physical address; for virtual
memory (/dev/kmem), virtual address.

mmap always demands PAGE_SIZE alignment of offset and address.
Or is it not those lowest (12 on i386) bits you're referring to
as lost?  If you're expecting mmap to map kernel memory at the
same addresses as kernel memory... well, that's already done
without mmap!  but not much help towards getting a userspace
mapping of kernel memory.

They do already use the offset as an offset; so I imagine you're
suggesting they be changed to work with "offset of virtual address
from PAGE_OFFSET" instead of simple virtual address, to match the
change you made to mmap_kmem in 2.6.19.
Adding further to the confusion and incompatibility between releases,
in a (slightly) more widely used interface than the mmap, for no gain?
No, I don't think so.

Thanks for the confirmation.

My point was merely that I'd much rather ask Linus (when he's back)
for a straight revert of your patch, than mess around with including
your change from __pa to virt_to_phys: that even if we prefer general
drivers to say virt_to_phys than __pa, drivers/char/mem.c is a special
case intimately bound up with mm and can be granted its present exemption.
