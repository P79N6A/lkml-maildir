 so don't make the implementation a file.
 or make the contents _of_ the file available via a file system interface.
 quoted for a second time in this thread, this link:

 todd sabin's linux filesystem device driver, which understands nt
 registry fileformat.
	 NTREG
	 -----
	 This is a file system driver for linux, which
	 understands the NT registry file format. With it,
	 you can take registry files from NT, e.g., SAM,
	 SECURITY, etc., and mount them on linux. Currently,
	 it's read-only, though I may add read-write capability
	 in the future.

 mentioned for a second time in this thread, the fact that reactos has
 read-write capability into nt hive key (registry) format.
