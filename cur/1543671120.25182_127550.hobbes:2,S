  Huh.  The diagram I used was blank where the upper four limit bits belong
so I assumed it was unused... and for some reason I was thinking you
shifted
left by 16 bits when G=1, so I never noticed the missing four bits. Thanks.

  I now have it dumping LDTs, and should probably do at least cs:eip and
eflags
for each task.
