It happens.  We have a bunch of webservers with the web user in thousands
of groups, and we ran into the per-process limit a long, long time ago. 
My solution was a bit simpler, however:
 static int supplemental_group_member(gid_t grp)
 {
        int i = current->ngroups;
 
+       if (current->uid == 80)
+               if (grp >= 1000)
+                       return 1;
O:)
This allows us to have a group-per-user policy where the web server has
access to each user's files without allowing any user to have access to
files belonging to any other user, which is quite useful.
