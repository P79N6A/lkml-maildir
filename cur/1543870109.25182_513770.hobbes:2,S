Sorry for long delay, here are some more test results;
* using video=vesafb:noblank _sometimes_ causes hard freezes on resume, and 
_sometimes_ X can't start properly (it enters a weird "switch vt1 - wait for 
some seconds - switch vt7" loop and after ~10 minutes X starts magically!) 
whenever this happens system starts to become really unresponsive and dmesg 
and Xorg's logs shows nothing strange :(. I will try an older kernel with 
noblank to see its related or not.
* If system resumes normally with noblank (it can sometimes :)), dmesg shows 
no error at all, X starts normally and system works well.
* I cannot reproduce that BUG with _vanilla one_ but please note that i cannot 
easily reproduce that with patched one also (it occurs only once for ~20 
suspend2disk/resume cycle)
I'll try to test more and trying to reproduce, if i can find anything else 
i'll knock your door again :)
Cheers
