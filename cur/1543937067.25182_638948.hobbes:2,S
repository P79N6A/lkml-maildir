With a filesystem that is compartmentalized and checksums metadata,
I believe that an online fsck is absolutely worth having.
Instead of the filesystem resorting to mounting the whole volume
read-only on certain errors, part of the filesystem can be offlined
while an fsck runs.  This could even be done automatically in many
situations.
