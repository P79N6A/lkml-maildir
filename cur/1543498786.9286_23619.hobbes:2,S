Something like that - and I agree, nearly all the machines I admin
tend to have <5 runnable processes on them.

I don't think 450 runnable processes is typical of any machine I've ever
seen. Even with 10 processes really trying to do anything, most machines
will be trashing their caches, and maybe swapping, etc. Your patch will
likely decrease performance on every machine I admin (about 40 machines).

I think you are just mistaken about the number of processes running on
most boxes, and that scheduling faster will just get lost in the noise on
a machine that really has several hundred processes running...
later,
