Hi:
      I'm reading linux kernel 2.4 source code and puzzled with
probe_roms().
In this function , rom was probed and request_resource was called. but I
don't understand these codes:
      for (base = 0xC0000; base < 0xE0000; base+=2048) {
          romstart = bus_to_virt(base);
          if (!romsignature(romstart))
                  continue;
          request_resource(&iomem_resource, rom_resources+roms);
          roms++;
          break;
      }
Because whether video rom is start from  0xC000:0000 or not, we request
a memory
resource start at 0xC0000 (I don't find any code change the contents of
rom_resources)
So I think these codes assume that there is a video rom at 0xc0000,  but
if this is true,
why not request_resource as SystemRom?
Thank you in advance.
Best regards !
