This is *not* a bug. lint is WARNING you (caps mine) that this may have
different results than expect. But the functionality behind the expression
is a C design feature that has been there since day one. Any compiler that
DOES execute the inside of the if() statement in the code you present would
be buggy.

No. Definitely not! The gcc compiler 'fixes' very obvious and
awful bugs.
#include <stdio.h>
int foo()
{
    return 0;
}
int main()
{
 int i;
 if(i=foo())
     (void)puts("If this is not seen, it is a compiler BUG!");
 return 0;
}
LCLint 2.2a --- 04 Sep 96
xxx.c: (in function main)
xxx.c:13,5: Test expression for if is assignment expression: i = foo()
  The condition test is an assignment expression. Probably, you mean to use
==
  instead of =. If an assignment is intended, add an extra parentheses
nesting
  (e.g., if ((a = b)) ...) to suppress this message. (-predassign will
suppress
  message)
xxx.c:13,5: Test expression for if not bool, type int: i = foo()
  Test expression type is not boolean or int. (-predboolint will suppress
  message)
Finished LCLint checking --- 2 code errors found
I started to notice sloppy code being written this way several years
ago when 'gcc' started to allow it. Just because 'gcc' fixes bad code
doesn't mean it's the way to go (unless it fixes the source at the
same time).
