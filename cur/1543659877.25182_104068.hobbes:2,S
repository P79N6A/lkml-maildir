That shouldn't happen - it's called DOS (Denial-Of-Service) if a user
program can make the kernel oops. Some of these probably still exist in
the linux kernel, nothing is perfect :-)
But another option exists: hardware failures. If your memory decides to
take a break, you will get an oops also.
Good luck,
