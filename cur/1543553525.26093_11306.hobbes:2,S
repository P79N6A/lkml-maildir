... but make sure you have no module unload races (or at least not too
huge holes, some are probably unavoidable with the current network
driver interface, e.g. without moving module count management a bit up). 
This means you should do MOD_INC_USE_COUNT very early at least to
minimize the windows (and DEC_USE_COUNT very late)

Just make sure you lock against your interrupt and xmit threads.

Sounds like dangerous advice.
