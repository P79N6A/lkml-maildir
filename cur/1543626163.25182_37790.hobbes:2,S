As far as I know, the x86 version of show_trace() still relies on the
fact that (a) return addresses are stored on the memory stack, (b)
they are stored in the order in which the routines were called, and
(c) that there aren't too many other values on the stack that look
like kernel text addresses.  As long as an x86 compiler uses the CALL
instruction, that should be the case.  But this certainly isn't the
case for all architectures (though I do agree that it is a heuristic
should work reasonably well for several architectures).
