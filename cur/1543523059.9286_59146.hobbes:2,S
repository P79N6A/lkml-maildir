   In effect this file is mis-advertising itself as readable.
   This is really the only thing that severely breaks walking /proc/sys
   with a simple shell script.
I pretty much agree with you.
That being said, if you can compose an exhaustive list of just the
networking sysctl tunables which have this behavior, I will work on
fixing it.  Doing this for me for both 2.2.x and 2.3.x would be
fantastic.
