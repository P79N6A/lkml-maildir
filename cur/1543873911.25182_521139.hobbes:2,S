it doesnt really get rid of it, it replaces it with another mechanism 
that is fundamentally unfair too.
RSDL has _another_, albeit more hidden "auto-nice" behavior: this time 
expressed not via the plain manipulation of priorities based on the 
sleep average, but expressed via the quota-depletion flux of tasks over 
time, fed into a complex dance of rotating priorities - which 
quota-depletion flux is in essence a sleep average too, just more 
derived and more hardcoded.
or looking at it from another angle, code size:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  15750      24    6008   21782    5516 sched.o.vanilla
  15960     360    6336   22656    5880 sched.o.rsdl
there's no reduction in complexity, it just moved elsewhere.
