Right, the ability to boot with security.capability=disabpled (or
whatever) and then load a custom module without having to use a whole
new kernel is something I'm sure end-users want.
Especially since compiling a kernel which works with, say, a default
fedora install, with lvm etc, is not imo for a novice (where novice
!= security novice).
Maybe there are no out of tree modules being used this way, or maybe
there are but I just don't know about them, or maybe like James says
they are all illegal modules and kill a puppy every time they are
loaded.

Ditto.  There is very loud support for this - which may mean there is
*broad* support for it.
If we could get a few (non-afilliated :) people who work with
customers in the security field to tell us whether this is being
used, that would be very helpful.  Not sure how to get that.
Or we just apply the patch and see who yells  :)
