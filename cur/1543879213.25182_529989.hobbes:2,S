Subject: [PATCH 0/4] i386 - pte update optimizations

Some PTE optimizations for native and paravirt-ops kernels; this
provides a huge win for shadow mode hypervisors and gets rid of
some unnecessary atomic instructions in native kernels, saving
even more on UP by getting rid of implicit LOCK on xchg instruction.
