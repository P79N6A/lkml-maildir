How about
a) bump the limit on the cmd line - it's still useful, and 256 really
is quite small for some things.
b) add a new boot option telling the kernel the name of some file in
initrd or similar from which to load additional options.
I don't know if b is feasible at all. It would mean that the kernel
would need to get a hold of the initrd or whatever quite early to be
able to process options from it, but if it's doable somehow it would
be a really neat thing.
