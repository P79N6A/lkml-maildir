Please include patches inline, so they can be quoted inline.
+#define system_utsname	(current->uts_ns->name)
This should be a static inline.
+struct uts_namespace *create_uts_ns(void)
+{
+	struct uts_namespace *ns;
+
+	ns = kmalloc(sizeof(struct uts_namespace), GFP_KERNEL);

IMHO, it's better to do something like:
{
	foo = kmalloc();
	if (foo) {
		stuff;
		etc;
	}
	return foo;
}
I suggest you use kzalloc(), too.
Also, I think the API approach needs to be determined before the patches 
go into -mm, in case it impacts on the code.
