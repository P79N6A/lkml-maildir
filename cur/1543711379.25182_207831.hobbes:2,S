Now that I try it, we lose.  ACPI allows us an unlimited number of resources
that can be routed to each bus, and pci_bus only has space for 4.  On my
rx2600 box, we have 5 resources pointing to bus 0x20:
# cat /proc/iomem /proc/ioports |grep :20
90000000-97ffffff : PCI Bus 0000:20
ff5e0000-ff5e0007 : PCI Bus 0000:20
ff5e2000-ff5e2007 : PCI Bus 0000:20
90004000000-90103fffffe : PCI Bus 0000:20
00002000-00002fff : PCI Bus 0000:20
Sure, you can argue that some of these should be coalesced and others
aren't used, but I'm not comfortable diddling with that in the kernel,
or asking firmware to change that.  And nobody knows what tomorrow will
bring in terms of PCI bus topologies.  So I'd like the insert_resource
patch to go in.
