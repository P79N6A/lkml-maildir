Well, I used rpm, and I built the rpm for all my samba 2.x's, heavily
customizing the spec file of course, to get all the files I needed (like
smbmount, for instance).

Here is the configure I used:
./configure --prefix=%{prefix} --exec-prefix=%{prefix} --libdir=/etc \
        --with-lockdir=/var/lock/samba --with-privatedir=/etc \
        --with-swatdir=%{prefix}/share/swat --with-smbwrapper \
        --with-automount --with-quotas --with-smbmount

As you can see, there is one binary and one softlink for smbmount. 
There was some reason for putting the link in /usr/sbin, but I can't
quite remember what it was.  Some RedHat thing, I'm sure...

These are the two patches that get applied:
Patch: makefile-path.patch
Patch1: smbw.patch
which are all that come with the package.
Last, but not least, is the version check, of a sort:
me2v:reliant me2v$ smbmount -v
smbmount: invalid option -- v
Usage: smbmount service <password> [-p port] [-d debuglevel] [-l log]
Version 2.0.3
        -p port               connect to the specified port
Well, there *should* be a -v or --version switch!!  Not a kernel
problem, though....
One last thing, to make sure it's not user error: Does it matter where
you enter the password? i.e., enter it on the command line or wait for
the Password prompt?  For some perverse reason I seem to prefer typing
my password at the password prompt, because it's not echoed back to the
screen.
