Definitely.  It's great to know that Linux works with a device, since
  I know that I can buy it and actually *use* it.  Double points if
  the *device* works with *linux*!
That said, there are lots of devices out there that aren't listed in the
  compatibility list.  I'd be nice to know if they *don't* work, since I
  won't feel tempted (if the price is right) to take it home and try it
  out.  Although, as another point, it'd be nice to bring all of the
  various device compatibility lists together in one place, esp. for the
  HAL/D-BUS/Utopia system, so that they could potentially query the list
  over the net.  Bonus points for a downloadable version for the distros!
Also, a known-helpful vendor list would be great, as I would be much more
  inclined to buy stuff from vendors who support Linux (as opposed to
  Linux supporting them).  It's important to me, and I like to put my
  money where my mouth is.  :)
In short, we should definitely work on maintaining a big device and vendor
  compatibility list ([butter]flies, honey, vinegar), but a known-bad/hostile
  list is also a nice thing to have, so that we can know to take our
  dollars elsewhere.
