i have a file server runing linux-2.2.15 (which work fine )
PIII 133 / 600EB 192 MB RAM
ASUS P3V4X VIA Apollo Pro133A Mainboard
77.5 GB Harddrives / 4 hard drives  160 MBs (cache) / 28 MBs ( real from
disk )
4 100 Mbs eth's ( need load bel)
1 SCSI            AHA-294X (80 MBs) (need to TCP/IP over this chanel) (
also if any one has the datasheet for this chip please!! send it to me
thank you)
2 IDE ports (VIA VT82C586 rev 10 IDE )
2 IDE ports ( PROMISE PDC20262  ) udma-66
i have found that the via ide port do not raid ( thay can not work at
the same time)
but the promise can
2 drives raid0 sould give me ( 160 MBS / 56 MBS (real))
the 2.2.x dose not have udma-66 drivers for the pdc20262
so i need 2.3.x or 2.4.x kernel witch will run on this system i have
been using 2.2.15
cau its stable but now have to use 2.3.x / 2.4.0 to use my hardwear so
can someone
tell me witch 2.3.x / 2.4.x kernel is the most stable (no probs whit
ext2 filesystem and no data coreruption)
Thank you.
