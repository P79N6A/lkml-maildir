Subject: [patch] kernel API doc system

Linus,
The attached patch, against 2.3.20-pre2, adds a simple inline api doc
system.
It allows programmers to document the interfaces they export through
in-line comments.  Docs, a Perl script, and two examples are included. 
Its design is such that it does not impose a burden on the developer --
you can add docs for public functions at your leisure.  (or wait for
contributors to send you docs...)
I think driver authors and other kernel hackers can benefit from having
a document which lists public functions, and describes their use.  This
should save much code-reading time, and also allow the communication of
design intentions and typical use (and abuse) of particular functions.
When this was sent to l-k, the main objections seemed to be "the code is
there, no need for docs" or "no docs are better than out-of-sync docs"
or similar.  In my own experience, having docs _with_ source code
greatly enhanced my understand of the code, so I therefore submit this
patch :)  It incorporates a few fixes since it was posted, and
suggestions from Jes Sorensen and others.
Patch notes
- auto-generated docs are stuck in a new build directory "autodoc". 
Right now only the file kernel-api.html is placed in there.  The
intention is to eventually use kernel-doc.pl to output man pages into
this directory as well.  (kernel-doc supports this already, but the
Makefile infrastructure does not)
- ignore the prototype warning during "make api-html"
Regards,
	Jeff
