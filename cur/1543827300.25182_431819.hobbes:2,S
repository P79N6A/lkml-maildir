No. I guess I didn't make my question clear.
My question is: Will an inode be released after the last file refers
to this is closed? If so, this could bring a performance issue.
Consider this case: a process open a file, read it, close it, then
reopen this file, read it, close it. For every open,  the inode has to
be read from disk again, which make hurt performance.
So I think inode should stay in inode_cache for a while, not released
right after the last file stops referring it. I just want to know
whether my guess is right. If it is, when will kernel release the
inode, since an inode cannot stay in memory forever.
