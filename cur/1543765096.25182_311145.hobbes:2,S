How does "having more features" as a reason equal "political bullshit" ?
I am done with this thread, because I know continuing the flaming is
what you live for.
Do what you want, because I know you will.
However, again, I want to state to everyone else on the list:
"I, Scott Kilau, as the copyright holder of the JSM driver, do NOT sign
off on this change".
