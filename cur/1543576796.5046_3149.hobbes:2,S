I thought that is what ->index is for ? 
Also gcc seems to be already quite clever at dividing through small
integers, e.g. using mul and shift and sub, so it may not be even worth to reach
for a real power-of-two. 
I suspect doing the arithmetics is at least faster than eating the 
cache misses because of ->index.
