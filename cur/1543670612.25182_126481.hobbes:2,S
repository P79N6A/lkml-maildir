I can very well accept that argument. What I am trying to do is only make
_someone_ writing a fs listen to the problem, and maybe - only maybe - in _his_
fs it is not as complicated and so he simply hacks it in. I am only arguing for
having a choice. Not more. If e.g. reiserfs had the feature I could simply
shoot all extX stuff and use my preferred fs all the time. That's just about
it. No religion involved. I am not arguing this type of feature as a
_must-have_. I only think regarding the neat stuff that is already inside
reiser (just to name my currently preferred fs) it would be very kind to have
write-error-recovery additionally.

Stephan
