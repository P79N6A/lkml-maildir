I don't see the point of such a release, so I'd say "no". Once we have a 
stable kernel, we make updates to _that_ one, not older ones.
HOWEVER - there may well be exceptions to this brought on by distribution 
usage etc. For example, if some distribution ends up basing it's work on 
(say) 2.6.8.1, and we later find a bug, we might release a 2.6.8.2 even 
though we might have done a 2.6.9 or even 2.6.10 later - just as a way to 
support the existing users who take a long time to update.
I consider that a pretty remote possibility, though. It's a lot more 
likely that the distribution-maker itself just does it's own patch on top 
of whatever release he started off with.
