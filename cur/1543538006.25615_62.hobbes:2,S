I didn't mean to imply that the technique should be applied more
generally.  printk is a very special case.  My solution was proposed
partially because:
I'm not even sure that kmalloc during printk is possible, since
printk might be called during kernel init, before all the kmem caches
are created.  (have no kernel tree here to check this, alas)
