I know I've seen this in the past, but the answer slips my mind and I
can't find anything in the archives.
I've just set up a box w/ an aic7xxx card.  The boot drive hangs off
that card.  During installation, the boot drive is sda.  Lilo contains
"root=/dev/sda8".  
I compiled a new kernel with the 3ware raid driver.  When I rebooted,
the 3ware card driver must have been loaded first; /dev/sda8 was no
longer the root device.
How do I control the device designations during boot?
