I felt masochistic, so decided to 'see what would happen' when I ran this..
for i in `find /lib/modules/2.6.2-prep/ -name *.ko`
do
	MOD=`basename $i | sed s/.ko//`
	echo module: $i
	echo inserting
	/sbin/modprobe $MOD
	sync
	echo removing
	/sbin/rmmod $MOD
	echo
	sync
	#sleep 1
done
.. And then sat back and watched the carnage.
After the ali1535 i2c module blew up and took the box with it,
I rebooted, and did a modprobe / rmmod of that module alone.
Exactly the same result. Reproducable every time.
