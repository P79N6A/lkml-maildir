Hi,
     Someone could help me having a complete futex doc ?
Here's a first version :
Regards,
Fabian
Documentation for futexes               kernel version 2.6.0-test6
        (c) 2003 Fabian Frederick <ffrederick@users.sourceforge.net>
Note : Based on user man page by Bert Hubert - Comments by Jamie Lokier.
===============================================================================
This file contains documentation for Fast Userspace Mutexes.
For complete authors list and sources you can read /kernel/futex.c
===============================================================================
What's a mutex ?
Mutex stands for mutual exclusion.In other words, it helps synchronizing processes
against shared memory access for instance.
Futex is basically a counter whose value is atomically updated in userland.
Any concurrent access will be managed in kernel space.
3 futex types exist :
	-shared
	-private
	-both
===============================================================================
Linux implementation
You can find POSIX mutex adaptation through futexes.User point of view and 
documentation can be found at 
http://ds9a.nl/futex-manpages/
Futex interface is sys_futex syscall.Here are recognized operations:
	-FUTEX_WAIT    : Wait a process to up futex.
	-FUTEX_WAKE    : Wake up all futex waiters.
	-FUTEX_FD      : Associate a file descriptor to futex
	-FUTEX_REQUEUE : Requeue all waiters hashed on one physical page to another
                         physical page.
