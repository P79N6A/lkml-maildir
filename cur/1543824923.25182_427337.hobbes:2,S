Interesting. Using dd, i am able to write some stuff to disk :
dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/blah count=1 -> hexdump /tmp/blah yields only 0s.
dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sda count=4 (count = 4, because /dev/random outputs blocks of 128 bytes)
dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/blah count=1 -> hexdump /tmp/blah yield random non-0 content
Trying to write past the first block, seems to freeze the disk or someting, at
least dd doesn't come back without me ctr-c'ing it.
Friendly,
Sven Luther
