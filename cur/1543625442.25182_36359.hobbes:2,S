Just to clarify things.
Lots of processes die from illegal op traps.. gcc, bash, make, etc... but
the instruction is ALWAYS  opcode 0x55 and is part of a subroutine preamble
in every case..  You are correct... 0x55 should not generate a trap.
Bad cpu? Hmmm, Tom has 6 different CPU's ( all p4 xeons ), on three
systems, that have this EXACT same problem.
and why does this require the system to be running smp?

The CPU is what triggers the exception.
So this sounds like a defect (or overheated) CPU to me.
OTOH, the kernel logs "invalid operand". Could you run ksymoops to get a
disassembly?
AFAICS, its a push %ebp instruction, which should not be illegal. So either
your stack is overflowing or my suspicion with the defect CPU is
applicable.
