Since the busy bit is set, we know the drive must have received a 
command.  Since dma_intr thought the drive was not busy, an interrupt 
must have snuck through between the command being issued and the dma 
being started.  I think in my original patch, I had the dma start 
outside of the spinlock, that is a bug.  The command to the controller 
to start the dma must be inside of the spinlock.
I have not looked at 2.4.21-pre4 at all, so I could be entirely off base 
here.
