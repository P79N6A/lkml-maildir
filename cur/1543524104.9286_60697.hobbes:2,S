Ok things are changing... I have justt lost interrupt on eth0, again I 
had to reboot to fix the problem... but at least this time a hard reboot 
wasn't neccessary.
The card is a PCI ne2k.  When the problem occurred I was downloading a 
some files via ftp and chatting on IRC and ICQ.  Not a particularly 
heavy amount of traffic.
I'll see if I can get this to reoccur.
TIA
Steve
