.. on partitions over a certain size, which couldn't be read with
older ext3 filesystems _anyway_
Enabling it by default on partitions of a size less than those
that need extents seems to be somewhat pointless to me?
Am I missing something fundamental that precludes the use of both
extent-based and current existing filesystems from the same code
simultaneously ?
