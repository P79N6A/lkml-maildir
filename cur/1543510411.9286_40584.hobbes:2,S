NFS was definitely involved in the hung machine.  Immediately prior to
the hang, I had done something like
	% cp -r /othermachine/dir ./
where the amount of data copied was several hundred megabytes.  both 
machines have only a single CPU -- CONFIG_SMP is NOT set.  i had typed
a few trivial commands on the client before the client hung.  the command
that hung the machine was a simple
	% cd xx<TAB>
where the <TAB> was to do command-line completion under tcsh.  that's when
the thing locked solid.  (the cwd directory at the time was itself NFS
mounted)
The NFS was linux-2.2.12 server to linux-2.2.12 client, with knfsd-1.4.7 on 
both client and server.
