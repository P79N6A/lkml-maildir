OK, I'll merge those directly.

Shall do.

How much work would that be?

Don't think so.  A node is a lump of circuitry which can have zero or more
CPUs, IO and memory.
It may initially have been conceived as a memory-only concept in the Linux
kernel, but that doesn't fully map onto reality (does it?)
There was a real-world need for this, I think from the Fujitsu guys.  That
should be spelled out in the changelog but isn't.

I guess it wouldn't be too hard for a 64-bit kernel to fake up 32-bit data
for 32-bit userspace.  For each architecture :( But let's see what Matt
thinks.

Done.
