Hi,
how about releasing 2.4.21 with the ptrace()-fix applied immediately
like it has been done with 2.2.25?
I think it's a serious bug and therefore it's time for a security-update.
If you think of ISC bind, PHP, sendmail or other software a new release
follows right after the availability of the patch. I'd like Linux
(and glibc as well) to do the same. You cannot call 2.4.20 a stable kernel
with such a bug, so as a leader of the 2.4.x-series you cannot call the
whole branch "stable".
World needs to update, best way to enforce is by a new release.
