Yep.
Actually w1 uses it only for simple event notifications, 
which definitely will be replaced with connector stuff...
So I woulf like to ask Dave about it, and if network people are still 
against it, I have no objection against this patch.
But I sould definitely prefer to move all such simple events into separate
event bus.

I even know who added it... :)
I still have question opened about message bus and connector.
Andrew has no objection against connector and it lives in -mm
quite long time, although was several time removed due to GregKH i2c
tree changes. All objections against it was only type of - "I do not like it"
Dmitry had some bugfixes which were added.
It was tested under quite heavy load on different types of systems
without overhead (with CBUS) and with _very_ convenient way of
controlling kernelspace from userspace and reverse event bus.
