No.  ;o)  I guess you have to ask that to be sure though.. ;o)
Keep in mind that under 2.2.13 it doesn't occur, but under 2.2.14
it does.  It takes a while, but not long to notice it, and it is
repeatable.

Not an incredible amount, but more than usual definitely.  During
the delay until I can move the mouse, or do stuff, the disk is
active 100% - usually anywhere from 4-10 seconds...
It feels like a memory leak or something like that...  I figured
maybe it was Netscape or something, but it happens even when
Netscape hasn't been started after boot, and only in 2.2.14.
Very strange.
