That issue is still there after the above patch is applied.
I found that [watchdog/#] is indeed migrated to other cpu because
migration_call is called before cpu_callback, i think this is the real
root cause very very possibly.
I suggest we can develop a new notifier infrastructure in which one
caller can specify whether it is kthread_stopping a cpu-bind kthread
so that such notifier callbacks can be executed prior to other
callbacks.
