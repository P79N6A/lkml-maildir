Right. I know. I've looked into this.
I thought I had fixed the last remaining backward compatibility 
between kernel and DRI (libraries and Xserver) by adding compatibility
ioctls. 
I still plan to revisit this issue and see if I can modify the code 
such that I don't need those compatibility ioctls.

OK. An earlier version is in the freedesktop CVS (#943). If you want 
I make a port to the DRI head. Unfortunately I probably won't be able 
to get at it for the next 2 - 3 weeks.
