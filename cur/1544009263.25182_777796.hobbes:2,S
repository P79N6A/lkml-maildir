And, btw, even if anybody actually does this, it should be up to the 
interrupt controller logic to re-initialize the interrupts so that they 
are back where they belong. IOW, we should never show such _idiotic_ 
brokenness to any actual driver, it should all be remapped and handled 
below them.
And I still have never heard any valid reason to do it in the first place, 
so until somebody actually gives a real example and an explanation, I 
would suggest ignoring the whole issue as some insane rumblings from crazy 
hw/firmare people doing idiotic things.
