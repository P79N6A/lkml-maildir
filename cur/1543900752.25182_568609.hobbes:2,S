"Test" messages are very, very inappropriate on the lkml or any other
list, for that matter. If you want to know whether the subscribe
succeeded, wait for a couple of hours after you get a reply from the
mailing list software saying it did. You'll undoubtedly get a number
of list messages. If you want to know whether you can post, you must
have something important to say, right? After you have read the
following paragraphs, compose a real letter, not a test message, in an
editor, saving the body of the letter in the off chance your post
doesn't succeed. Then post your letter to lkml. Please remember that
there are quite a number of subscribers, and it will take a while for
your letter to be reflected back to you. An hour is not too long to
wait.
