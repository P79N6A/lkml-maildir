There's one problem with that though - if someone maintains many files,
and his email address changes, you end up with a large patch changing all
those email addresses in every file.
IMHO its far better to have someone's name at the top of each file, and
put the email addresses in the MAINTAINERS file.
People don't change their names often, but email addresses do change.
