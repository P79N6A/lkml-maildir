The cache cost argument is specious. Even misaligned, smaller is
smaller. The cache footprint reduction is merely amortized,
probabilistic, etc.

I'm not so sure about that. I doubt we have issues with that. I say
if there's to be padding to 64B to use the of the whole additional
space for additional flag bits. I'm sure fs's could make good use of
64 spare flag bits, or whatever's left over after the VM has its fill.
Perhaps so many spare flag bits could be used in lieu of buffer_heads.
page->virtual is the same old mistake as it was when it was removed.
The virtual mem_map code should be used to resolve the computational
expense. Much the same holds for the atomic_t's; 32 + PAGE_SHIFT is
44 bits or more, about as much as is possible, and one reference per
page per page is not even feasible. Full-length atomic_t's are just
not necessary.
However, there are numerous optimizations and features made possible
with flag bits, which might as could be made cheap by padding struct
page up to the next highest power of 2 bytes with space for flag bits.
