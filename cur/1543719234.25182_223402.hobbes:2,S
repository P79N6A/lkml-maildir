Up until recently we've had the person doing the BK commit, plus
person they received it from.  That's identical to the two-level chain
of custody which Larry was proposing as being "good enough" most of
the time.  But more recently, there have been changelog comments like
this:
ChangeSet@1.1743.1.52, 2004-05-25 08:43:49-07:00, akpm@osdl.org
  [PATCH] minor sched.c cleanup
  Signed-off-by: Christian Meder <chris@onestepahead.de>
  Signed-off-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
  The following obviously correct patch from Christian Meder simplifies the

Which do show the original author.
