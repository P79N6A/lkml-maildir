Is this the same "relaxed ordering" defined in PCIe 1.0 specs?
If so, as explained before, use of "RO" bit in the DMA transactions
is up the the device and it MUST send a DMA transaction without
RO bit set to flush in-flight writes to the device. The host OS
does not have control over individual transactions, just the
general enablement of the feature. And "RO" bit should be
transperent to current applications including RDMA.
It's a very different issue than the SN2 node interconnect where
ALL transactions can be re-ordered by default and we have to do
something special to force ordering whene DMA writes are issued
to specific memory regions. The PCI device has no control over
this (unlike RO-bit discussed above).
