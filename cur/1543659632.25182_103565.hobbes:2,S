No need.  You can memcpy the environment.  See setenv(3),
putenv(3) and related library routines.
Once you've parsed your argv who cares if you overwrite it,
put a double NULL at the end, set argc = 1 and argv[1] =
NULL.  If argv[argc] - argv[0] + strlen(argv[argc] is
shorter than what you overwrite it with you won't even need
to relocate the environment block if you wish to preserve
that.  Just don't leave any loose ends to confuse /proc and
the ps utils.
