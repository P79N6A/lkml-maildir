As I said, I was talking out of my ass [aka, I didn't know and was just 
guesstimating for the heck of it], so I am happily proven wrong--thanks to
Chris and you--I guess I didn't take into account voluntary yielding of
the CPU by a task; I was more guiding myself for kicked out by a timer
making a task runnable, or a timeslice expiring, etc...which now are 
more or less guided by the tick [and then of course, we have IRQs,
but that's another matter]

Once my logic is proven wrong, then it makes full sense :]
Thanks for the heads up.
