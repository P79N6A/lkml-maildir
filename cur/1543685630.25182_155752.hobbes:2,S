Also, please wrap your emails at a sane size, you have lines here that
are longer than 900 characters long...  I've reformatted them here to be
able to quote them properly.

So why would we ever want CONFIG_PCI_MSI to not be set?  I'm just trying
to make options dynamically happen without users having to worry about
setting a kernel option or not.

Good, so we can always enable this option, so it doesn't even need to be
an option :)

Yet you provide an api for drivers to use, right?  Why would a driver
want to use this api instead of just having the hardware work properly
on its own?  I guess I'm confused as to how to modify drivers to support
this, or if that's even needed to be done.

The "current" one does.  What happens in a few months when I go to help
bring up the next gen hardware platform?  Will I run into the problem
that this number needs to be increased?  Can we determine it at
run-time?

No, it needs to go into the .c file where the function is.

Um, I ment the variable is in the global symbol table, and it doesn't
look like it needs to be.
But your comment about number of devices is also a good one.  Any way we
can figure that out at run-time too?  What happens when I hot-add the 33
MSI capable device?  Or just boot with that many devices (I've seen
boxes with 100s of pci devices all attached to one system)?
