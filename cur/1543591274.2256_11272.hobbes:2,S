OK. How do you figure on dealing with the problem of multiple
high-level drivers talking to the same device? How does sr.o "know"
that this is also a CD-RW? How does sg.o "know" that this is also a
tape?
Where does the responsibility lie for figuring out the capabilities?
Further, which device node/fs/driver exports the capability list?
And what about locking between drivers?
