I have a partition that used to be part of a software
raid 1 array. It is now loaded as /dev/sda3 but I'd
like to mirror it to /dev/sdb3 without losing the data
on the drive. I'm a little nervous about how to set it
up as I don't want to wipe out the data.
How do I do this? Using FC6 and up 2 date software.
Thanks in advance.
