I've now switched the CD drives over to the VIA IDE interfaces, and am no
longer getting "lost interrupt" messages. However, I can't succesfully rip
audio from CDs, because I get continual "packet command errors" while
cdda2wav is doing its thing. This results in extremely slow rip speeds...
This is occurring with both 2.4.19-pre8 and 2.4.19-pre8-ac4 (which I believe
has a number of Andre's latest IDE updates included). Also, trying to rip
from my first drive (/dev/cdroms/cdrom0 since I'm using devfs) produces
"cooked: Read TOC: not implemented". For some reason the ide-cd driver
thinks this drive is incapable of doing audio ripping; this may be due to
the fact that it's the master drive on the first IDE channel on the
motherboard and the BIOS left it in some strange mode...
I can mount ISO9660 CDs without apparent problems now, though, so it does
appear that there was some bad Promise/CD drive interaction before. Strange.
What else can be done to work on these audio ripping problems?
