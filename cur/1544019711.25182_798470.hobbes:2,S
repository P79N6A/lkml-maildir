I also continued to work on my patches, but then my reasons for caring
about PCI hotplug disappeared due to the current economic climate.
I updated my "remove" patch to include documentation.  I created a patch
that added "/sys/bus/pci/scan", but not the per-device version.  And I
updated my new fakephp driver to support rescanning.
Everything worked, but when a bridge was rescanned there would be annoying
warning messages.  I never got around to figuring about what to do about
that.  It seems like the code that assigns bridge resources wasn't intended
to handle bridges that already had resources assigned to them, though it
does work.
Maybe your series can use my latest patches for removal and legacy_fakephp?
It sounds like your patches for rescanning do more than mine.

Does it not work, or is it just warnings?  I didn't have any problems with
resources ending up unassigned, but I did get warnings.  I think there was
also an issue with removed and rescanned devices' resources' ->parent
pointers not being the same as they were before removal.  Which doesn't
seem to matter any, but made me feel like the code wasn't right yet.

I came to the same conclusion.  fakephp or acpiphp will oops if you use the
other to remove a pci device.  The drivers just aren't designed to handle a
pci device being removed out from under them.

My new fakephp driver seems to handle this ok, maybe other php drivers
could do the same thing?
