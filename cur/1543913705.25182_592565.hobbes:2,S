Subject: [PATCH][RFC] Secure defaults (initial sysctl settings)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/9/160

Allow for various sysctl settings to initially be set to more secure
defaults.
Why: While you can easily set these values at boot time with sysctl
(and most distros do).
-Its nice to be able to set their initial value.
-It also allows someone who is unfamiliar with all the security knobs
the kernel exposes to easily turn one on or off (or even read about
what it does).
-Another benefit is every time a new security feature comes out
(mmap_min_addr for example) you don't have to change the setting on
every server.  Or heck even be totally unaware of it until you read
about it on <insert favorite news source> months later.
While some options (syncookies comes to mind) might be better places
somewhere else...
Im more interested to see if anyone thinks this is a good idea.
I mainly did this because I wanted a way to turn on mmap_min_addr by default.
After which i thought hrm, what other sysctl settings do I regularly
change the default setting...
Also it *seems* like it might be nice to move other security related
(fstack-protector, seecomp) under Security.
What does everyone else think?
Oh and sorry about the gross use of Kconfig CONFIG_ defines, whats a
better way to do this?  static inlines #ifdef CONFIG_XXX in the
headers?
