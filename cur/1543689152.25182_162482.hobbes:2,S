I think on earlier kernels there was a bug in ACPI which prevented it from 
being used for PCI IRQ routing. I know this was fixed somewhere in the 2.5.5X 
series.
When this bug was fixed, it unfortunately caused my nforce2 board to stop 
working because of other IRQ issues, which is how I got into this. Its likely 
the same thing causes older kernels to work with Via motherboards to work 
'cos ACPI isn't being used for IRQ routing.
2.4.22 has the ACPI from 2.6 backported into it, (which includes my patch for 
nforce2 boards) so it will start having the same issue with the BIOS bug in 
KT333/KT400  boards.
