Yes, it's one option (In fact, my first idea was using it),
though we need to move the following lines into
pci_enable_device_bars() from pci_enable_device().
        pci_fixup_device(pci_fixup_enable, dev);
        dev->is_enabled = 1;
Actually, IIRC, there are one or two existing drivers using it.
In addition to pci_enable_device_bars(), we can use
pci_request_region() for requesting each region instead of using
pci_request_regions().
The reason I didn't use this option was I thought we would need
bigger changes to drivers if we use pci_enable_devie_bars() and
pci_request_region(). For example, if we use pci_request_region()
for requesting the specific regions and if an error occurs
while doing that, we need to release only the regions we succeeded
in requesting. I think this is a little bit troublesome for driver
writers. In adition, though this is my personal opinion, only one
API to enable devices (e.g. pci_enable_device()) looks nice to me.
Anyway, I think it would be nice if we can solve the problem by
as small changes as possible to the existing drivers.
How do you think?
Thanks,
Kenji Kaneshige
