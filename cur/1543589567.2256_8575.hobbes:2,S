Here's my stab at reblocking support. I've tested with VFAT filesystems on a
SCSI magneto-optical with 2k hw block size. losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/sda1 &&
mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/mo. read/write/mmap appear to work, but obviously the code
is in dire need for optimisations. What's the reasoning behind never caching bhs
to the underlying blkdev? Using getblk&friends instead of allocating each bh
ourselves and dropping it right afterwards would make the code a lot less
horrible. But I fear someone must have had good reason not to do so. Does
anyone know details? And moreover, does anyone see problems with this change
other than performance woes?
Regards,
Daniel.
