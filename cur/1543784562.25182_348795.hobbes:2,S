This breaks your w1 code:
	    CC [M]  drivers/w1/w1_ds2433.o
	  drivers/w1/w1_ds2433.c: In function `w1_f23_refresh_block':
	  drivers/w1/w1_ds2433.c:84: error: `CRC16_INIT' undeclared (first use in this function)
	  drivers/w1/w1_ds2433.c:84: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
	  drivers/w1/w1_ds2433.c:84: error: for each function it appears in.)
	  drivers/w1/w1_ds2433.c:84: error: `CRC16_VALID' undeclared (first use in this function)
	  drivers/w1/w1_ds2433.c: In function `w1_f23_write_bin':
	  drivers/w1/w1_ds2433.c:224: error: `CRC16_INIT' undeclared (first use in this function)
	  drivers/w1/w1_ds2433.c:224: error: `CRC16_VALID' undeclared (first use in this function)
So I'm not going to apply this :(
