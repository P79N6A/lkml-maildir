Hmm, no luck for you, today?
Have you possibilities to check the signal integrity in your design?
Did you play some of the electrical engineering tricks to see if things
are changing? (change some terminations, temperature, voltages)

Well, what about getting a datasheet of the PDC, one of the latest kernels and
start to debug that thing down to the silicon?
There is a person called Ed Huang (Sales and Marketing Div.) at Promise
in Taiwan where we got our datasheets and reference designs for our embedded
project. Unfortunately, you need to sign a NDA. But beside that, the support
is pretty okay. (I just send you the contact in private email).
Best greets,
