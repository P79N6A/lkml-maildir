But the Hammer is a NUMA architecture and a working NUMA scheduler
should be flexible enough to deal with it. And: the corner case of 1
CPU per node is possible also on any other NUMA platform, when in some
of the nodes (or even just one) only one CPU is configured in. Solving
that problem automatically gives the Hammer what it needs.

No, no, the local load balancer just doesn't make sense now if you
have one cpu per node. It is called although it will never find
another cpu in the own cell to steal from. There just is nothing
else... (or did I misunderstand your comment?)

That's one way, but the proposed patch just solves the problem (in a
more general way, also for other NUMA cases). If you deconfigure NUMA
for a NUMA platform, we'll have problems switching it back on when
adding smarter things like node affine or homenode extensions.

Great! Thanks!
