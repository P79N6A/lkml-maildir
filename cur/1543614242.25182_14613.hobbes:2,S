Release 1.9.12: Sat Dec 22 13:35:14 EST 2001
	* Rulebase and help sync with 2.4.17-rc2/2.5.2-pre1.
	* Corrected a typo in kxref.py that caused portability problems.
Ordinary point release for beta testers.  I'm still working on Richard Todd's
dependency bugs, and they're still unlikely to be a problem in ordinary
cases.

A ``decay in the social contract'' is detectable; there is a growing
feeling, particularly among middle-income taxpayers, that they are not
getting back, from society and government, their money's worth for
taxes paid. The tendency is for taxpayers to try to take more control
of their finances...	-- IRS Strategic Plan, (May 1984)
