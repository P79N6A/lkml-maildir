Subject: [PATCH] Better argument size tracking in fs/exec.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/8/12/223

Introduce a new variable "arg_size" and set it appropriately in each
arm of the CONFIG_STACK_GROWSUP.  This patch fixes a bug for PA-RISC
and makes the code cleaner for everyone.
