No, it doesn't.  C pointers do not behave like machine addresses,
there are additional constraints.

This casting falls into the category "additional language constructs
supported by GCC".  The standard contains wording which encourages
implementors to include a meaningfull conversion from a pointer type
to an integral type, but there is no requirement that this has the
semantics expected by most programmers.
