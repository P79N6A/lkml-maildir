The intended purpose of TIF_MEMDIE was to allocate pages without being 
bound by the watermarks so that they have access to memory reserves on the 
per-zone level.  If the cpuset doesn't have access to a zone, whether it's 
memory reserve or not, it shouldn't allocate there.

You'd have to cite them first.

No, it means that it can allocate anywhere based on the zonelist ordering 
and then can OOM a very small exclusive cpuset that would never have had 
any memory pressure if it wasn't violated.
