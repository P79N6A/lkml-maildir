Subject: [PATCH 1/2] RFC: Fix futex_wake_op fault handling (NOT FOR INCLUSION)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/9/47

As the the uaddr doesn't change after attempts to handle the fault, there is no
need to re-get the futex keys after get_user().  This patch makes successful
calls to futex_handle_fault() and get_user() start the retry from the same
point (right after the get_futex_key calls).  Also simplify the logic and
corrects missing put on the futex keys.  Finally, update the comment to more
accurate reflect the current code (we no hold the mm sem here).
