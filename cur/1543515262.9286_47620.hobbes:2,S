I think kernels of most distrubtion was compiled for UP (uniprocessor)
kernel since using SMP does not needed for most systems. (but I don't
know RedHat so ...) However if even RedHat uses SMP kernel you SHOULD
recompile it, since you can gain MUCH MORE power for your system if you
optimize your own kernel for yourself. This is true for EVERY Linux system,
and it's normal. Kernel compiling is an easy task. Think a bit : most OSes
hasn't got the chance to compile your kernel, so it carries many performance
brakes and unoptimized solutions for your actual system.
This was an "only imho" letter :)
