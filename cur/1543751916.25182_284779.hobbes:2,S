This has the downside that applications may die well after the event
that caused the excess. Also, I can see situations in RT where strict
limits are put in place to ensure that particular apps are never
starved so strict accounting is occassionally desireable.
Perhaps we could do the accounting on the fly iff we have an rlimit in
the first place and we're already over half of it? Such strict
accounting could triggered by a process flag turned off and on inside
acct_update_integrals.
One also wonders if once per timer tick is more processing for compute
intensive workloads.
Finally, do { } while (0); is a bit of cargo cult. The compilers no
longer warn for empty statements so a null #define is fine.
