	Manufacturers design product as they see fit and offer it on the market; I 
don't see nVidia or ATI thugs twisting your arm behind you as you walk down 
the aisle of Fry's Electronics saying "buy this nice card we made or I'll 
break your arm."
	The bottom line is this: companies speak dollarese expertly. If you don't 
like product X because it does not include specs or don't like the policies of 
its manufacturer towards the community then vote with your wallet.
