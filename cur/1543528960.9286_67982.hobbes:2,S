There are numerous files that are under a dual license, which is
perfectly ok.  I don't actively encourage it, because it creates
problems if somebody else than the original author were to ever say "I
want to patch the Linux GPL'd version of this file, but I do NOT want to
make my changes available under the BSD license" or vice versa, but it
hasn't been a problem so far, so it's not something I discourage either. 
(And besides, if somebody were to send me a patch with those kinds of
restrictions, my solution would probably be to just not accept the patch
in the first place). 
The one file you mention (bsd_comp.c) is the only real special case that
I'm aware of, which is why it cannot be linked into the kernel directly
(it only ever gets built as a module - not for any technical reasons,
but simply due to the copyright issue).
