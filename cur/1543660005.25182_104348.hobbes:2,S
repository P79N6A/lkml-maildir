ibm had some  mail problems --- nasty storm of bounces. I don'tknow if
it is related.

Well, loop_delay() was big (fatal!) problem -- it can actaully wait
for *less* time than told to. That happens if notebook boots during
"battery low" and than goes to AC power. Thinkpad 560X is example of
such behaviour. Slow (but working!) PIT seems to be only option on
such machine.
