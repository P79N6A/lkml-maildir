Dear all,
I receive the following error message while compiling an 'old-style'
driver in 2.5.59:
'MOD_IN_USE': undeclared function
However, when applying 'param-oldstyle.patch.gz' to support old-style
"MODULE_PARM" declarations, I get
Patching file include/linux/module.h
Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected! Assume -R? [n]
I think that if the patch had already been applied, I should get an
option: 
[]config OBSOLETE_MODPARM 
But my current kernel configuration looks like this and I can't find
[]config OBSOLETE_MODPARM anywhere:
[Y]Enable loadable module support
	[Y] Module unloading
		[]Forced module unloading
	[Y] Kernel module loader
I would be grateful for any advice on how to successfully apply the
patch and compile this device driver for 2.5.59.
Thank you.
Regards,
Se-Hsieng
