The machine isn't broken. It's Linux.
I didn't believe that you'd have 320MB just because it's such an odd
number, but the problem is that Linux apparently starts allocating the PCI
address space just _under_ the 320MB mark (you probably have some memory
reserved for ACPI that doesn't show up in the e820 memory map).
The PCI allocation needs to be fixed, but I'm off for two days in
Finland..
