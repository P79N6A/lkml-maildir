Subject: Radeon 7000 problems with kernels after 2.6.3

On recent kernel (2.6.4 and later) my Radeon 7000 doesn't display
anything. My Eizo monitor warns me of really incompatible frequencies
(fV 217.2 Hz, fH 271.5 kHz). fbset returns normal values, by the way.
I've found out that this chunk in patch-2.6.4, applying to
drivers/video/aty/radeon_base.c, causes my problems:

I've seen other messages about problems with radeonfb. Can other people
confirm this problem, and confirm that removing this chunk fixes the
problem?
Kind regards,
