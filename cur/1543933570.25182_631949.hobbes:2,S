Duh. Disregard that patch. It looks like check_pgt_cache() is not called. 
This could happen if tlb_flush_mmu is never called during the 
fork/terminate sequences in your script. pgd_free is called *after* a 
possible tlb flush so the pgd page is on the quicklist (which is good for 
the next process which needs a pgd). The tlb_flush_mmu's during pte 
eviction should trim the quicklist. For some reason this is not happening 
on your box (it works here).
Could you try this script that insures that check_pgt_cache is called 
after every pgd_free?
