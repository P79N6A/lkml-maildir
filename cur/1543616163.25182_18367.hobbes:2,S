Subject: [BUG][PATCH] 2.4.* mlockall(MCL_FUTURE) is broken -- child inherits  VM_LOCKED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In 2.4.*, mlockall(MCL_FUTURE) is erroneously inherited by child processes
across fork() and exec():
 1. across a fork(), the inherited memory is not locked, but any new memory
    allocations by the child will be VM_LOCKED.
 2. across a subsequent exec(), *all* of the exec'd program's memory except
    for its stack pages will be VM_LOCKED.
The problem is:
 1.  if MCL_FUTURE, mm->def_flags gets set to VM_LOCKED in do_mlockall().
 2.  mm->def_flags is not cleared during subsequent forks and execs.
 3   mm->def_flags, with the leftover VM_LOCKED flag set, is subsequently
     utilized in calc_vm_flags() when called by do_brk() to extend the
     address space of a forked process, and by do_mmap_pgoff() when
     building the non-stack address space of an exec'd process.
The proposed patch puts the fix in mm_init(), which seems to be the most
appropriate place since it's called by copy_mm(), and by mm_alloc() on behalf
of exec_mmap():

Note that it worked OK in 2.2 because mm->def_flags was explicitly cleared in
mm_alloc(), which was called by both copy_mm() and exec_mmap().  But things
were shuffled around a bit in 2.4, and it must have gotten lost in the
translation...
