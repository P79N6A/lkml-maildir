I've just tried the OSS Trident driver.  It sounds different.
I'm still getting noticable audio dropouts in bumprace.  Timidity
sounds ok, now.  Other apps sound, oh, I don't know, scratchy is the
best word, I guess.  It's almost as if the dropouts are occuring
more frequently (much more frequently) but with shorter duration,
making it sound like scratchy sound rather than sound with punctuated
silence as it did under Alsa.
Maybe some sort of interrupt handling problem not getting the bits
where they need to be at the right time?
