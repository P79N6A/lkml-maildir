Unfortunately this is broken :(
Specifically, stuff using esddsp is only allowed to change its sample
rate (SNDCTL_DSP_SPEED) and 8/16bitness (SNDCTL_DSP_SETFMT) once.
This breaks, eg, NAS-over-esd.
The code to do this in esddsp looks quite deliberate but for goodness
sake I can't see why it is (see esddsp::dspctl(), especially the
`settings' variable.)
I've asked the authors why this is, and the query vanished into a black
hole.
Pity, really, as esddsp could be rather cool. One of these days I'll
take out that `settings' cruft and see if esddsp still works.
