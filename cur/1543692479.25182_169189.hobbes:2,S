Clearly the "some is good, more is better" approach doesn't provide
stable balance between sound and cpu hogs. It isn't a question of "how
much" cpu, just "when"which works or not.
This is sort of like the deadline scheduler in that it trades of
throughput for avoiding jackpot cases. I think that's desired behaviour
in a CPU schedular too, at least if used by humans.
