Peter Zijlstra and I have been discussing this IPI Resched change a bit.
It seems that it is too much overkill for what is needed. That is, the
send_reschedule is used elsewhere where we do not want to actually do a
schedule.
I'm thinking about trying out a method that each rq has the priority of
the current task that is running. On case where we get an rt overload
(like in the finish_task_switch) we do a scan of all CPUS (not taking any
locks) and find the CPU which the lowest priority. If that CPU has a lower
prioirty than a waiting task to run on the current CPU then we grab the
lock for that rq, check to see if the priority is still lower, and then
push the rt task over to that CPU.
If after taking the rq lock a schedule had taken place and a higher RT
task is running, then we would try again, two more times. If this
phenomenon happens two more times, we punt and wouldn't do anything else
(paranoid attempt to fall into trying over and over on a high context
switch RT system).

The above three may be obsoleted by this new algorithm.
