Yes, yes, yes.
ftp'ed ltmodem-5.78d from 
http://walbran.org/sean/linux/stodolsk
compiled without error on 2.4.1-pre2, but "ltinst" failed to
install on 2.4
You'll have to fix ltinst for 2.4 by modifying this line ...
        cp ltmodem.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char
Tested on IBM 240Z and it's running ok.
# cu -l ttyLT0
Connected.
ati
LT V.90 Data+Fax Modem Version 5.78
OK
Thanks,
Jeff.
