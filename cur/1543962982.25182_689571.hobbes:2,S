Subject: ptrace PTRACE_PEEKUSER behavior

The call ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKUSER, <pid>, ...) does not work as described in the
man page.
Specifically, the man page states:
PTRACE_PEEKUSER
	Reads a word at offset addr in the child's USER area, which
	holds the registers and other information about the process (see
	<linux/user.h> and <sys/user.h>). The word is returned as the
	result of the ptrace() call. Typically the offset must be word-
	aligned, though this might vary by architecture. (data is
	ignored.)
Using the PTRACE_PEEKUSER action, the "regs" component can be read, but the
values past regs are not obtained. Even the reg values are not  
retrieved from a
'user' structure, but from the 'task_struct' of the process.
linux-2.6.26-rc1/include/asm-x86/user_32.h defines struct user like this.
/* When the kernel dumps core, it starts by dumping the user struct -
this will be used by gdb to figure out where the data and stack segments
are within the file, and what virtual addresses to use. */
struct user{
	/* We start with the registers, to mimic the way that "memory" is returned
	from the ptrace(3,...) function. */
	struct user_regs_struct regs; /* Where the registers are actually stored
	*/
	/* ptrace does not yet supply these. Someday.... */ <===================
	int u_fpvalid; /* True if math co-processor being used. */
	/* for this mess. Not yet used. */
	struct user_i387_struct i387; /* Math Co-processor registers. */
	/* The rest of this junk is to help gdb figure out what goes where */
	unsigned long int u_tsize; /* Text segment size (pages). */
	unsigned long int u_dsize; /* Data segment size (pages). */
	unsigned long int u_ssize; /* Stack segment size (pages). */
	unsigned long start_code; /* Starting virtual address of text. */
	unsigned long start_stack; /* Starting virtual address of stack area.
	This is actually the bottom of the stack, the top of the stack is always
	found in the	esp register. */
	long int signal; /* Signal that caused the core dump. */
	int reserved; /* No longer used */
	struct user_pt_regs * u_ar0; /* Used by gdb to help find the values for */
	/* the registers. */
	struct user_i387_struct* u_fpstate; /* Math Co-processor pointer. */
	unsigned long magic; /* To uniquely identify a core file */
	char u_comm[32]; /* User command that was responsible */
	int u_debugreg[8];
};
Noting the comment after 'struct user_regs_struct regs', is there any specific
reason why ptrace doesn't provide the rest of the members of this  
structure? In
that case shouldn't the man pages be corrected?
