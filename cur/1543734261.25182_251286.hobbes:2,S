Ok, if that is the reason it's ok. When I asked "Why remove it" I've been said 
"look at the code and you'll see why". Probably I'm blind, then. (And it can 
be true, because I'm somehow a new-comer in kernel hacking).
The "Fuzzy retrieval" is probably useless, clearly, but it's not clear to me 
the problem with the other code.

Hmm, everything is true, apart that we need some generic lookup way. That can 
be true for now - using something means using something tested.
However, for the future, hashing is lower-O than rb-trees (if the hash 
function is good), but while an empty rb-tree requires no memory (just the 
root node), an hash requires anyway the table. That's the difference. And 
there is no generic hash struct because (I guess) the developer prefer it not 
to be generic - hashing is used for many things, but developed individually.

Yes, and I meant at that moment.

It would be stabler, if it has been tested. But since I guess ubd-mmap was the 
only tester, (and it did not work), it's ok to shift to rb-trees.
Also, I still don't have clear why it's a "grunge".
