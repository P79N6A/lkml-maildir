Yes, I was going to just attach to the vma, along with potentially also
require a flag at mmap time (MAP_SEMAPHORE - some other unixes have
something like it already) to tell the OS about the consistency issues
that might come up on some architectures (on x86 it would be a no-op).

Not as-is, but all the kernel infrastructure should be there in theory.

Fair enough. I think I suggested that just as another sanity check, and
because some architectures _will_ require address issues (not necessarily
total equality, but at least "modulo X equality").
