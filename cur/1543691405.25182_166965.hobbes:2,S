Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Wikification of mustfix/shouldfix lists
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Since Andrew's not exactly enthusiastic about maintaining must/should fix
lists, I've put them up in wiki form on the kernelnewbies wiki.
http://kernelnewbies.org/wiki/moin.cgi
 (on the front page, towards the bottom)
Maybe if everybody can edit them, they'll stay more-or-less uptodate.
I've edited them a bit to get rid of some of the bits I know are done, but
I'm sure there's plenty of things in there that are done.  In particular,
I incorporated Nick Piggin's patch that he sent earlier today.

Do you think I want to have an academic debate on this subject?" -- Robert Fisk
