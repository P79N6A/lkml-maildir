My new 56k internal modem has speakerphone jacks, etc, and voice
recording capabilities allegedly.  AOPEN 56k.  Although it works
fine (but not at 56k) for dialin, I'm wondering if I can actually
use the speakerphone and voice recording features in Linux.  The
.INF file that came with it contains stuff like:
HKR, SpeakerPhoneEnable,      1,, "at#vls=6<cr>"
HKR, SpeakerPhoneEnable,      2,, "at#cls=8<cr>"
HKR, SpeakerPhoneEnable,      3,, "at#spk=1,10,2<cr>"
HKR, SpeakerPhoneDisable,    1,, "at#spk=0,16,,<cr>"
HKR, SpeakerPhoneDisable,    2,, "at#vls=0<cr>"
HKR, SpeakerPhoneMute,        1,, "at#vls=6<cr>"
HKR, SpeakerPhoneMute,        2,, "at#spk=0,,,<cr>"
HKR, SpeakerPhoneUnMute,      1,, "at#vls=6<cr>"
HKR, SpeakerPhoneUnMute,      2,, "at#spk=1,,,<cr>"
HKR, SpeakerPhoneSetVolumeGain,  1,, "at#vls=6<cr>"
HKR, SpeakerPhoneSetVolumeGain,  2,, "at#spk=,<Vol>,<Gain><cr>"
HKR, StartPlay,               1,, "at#vtx<cr>"
HKR, StopPlay,                1,, "None"
HKR, StopPlay,                2,, "NoResponse"
HKR, StartRecord,             1,, "at#vrx<cr>"
HKR, StopRecord,              1,, "None"
HKR, StopRecord,              2,, "NoResponse"
HKR,, TerminateRecord,,      "<h10><cr>"
HKR,, TerminatePlay,,        "<h10><h03>"
HKR,, AbortPlay,,            "<h10><h18>"
HKR, LineSetPlayFormat,       1,, "at#vls=0<cr>"
HKR, LineSetRecordFormat,     1,, "None"
HKR, LineSetRecordFormat,     2,, "NoResponse"
HKR, HandsetSetRecordFormat,   1,,"at#vsr=7200<cr>"
HKR, HandsetSetRecordFormat,   2,,"at#vbs=4<cr>"
HKR, HandsetSetPlayFormat,     1,,"at#vsr=7200<cr>"
HKR, HandsetSetPlayFormat,     2,,"at#vbs=4<cr>"
HKR, OpenHandset,               1,, "at#cls=8<cr>"
HKR, OpenHandset,               2,, "at#vls=1<cr>"
HKR, CloseHandset,                   1,, "at#vls=0<cr>"
HKR, CloseHandset,                   2,, "at#cls=0<cr>"
I could probably script up some nasty perl to get it to work, but
does anyone know of existing software for Linux to exploit these
capabilities?  Does it need to be connected to a sound card for
actual recording, or does the DSP in the modem work?
