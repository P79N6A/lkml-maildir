If user X mounts a filesystem, and root wants to access it, it can do
'su X' and see the otherwise inaccesible files.

OK, so you're saying, it should be a per-mountpoint flag, and not a
per-process one.
Then the solution is simple I think.  Root can just remount the
filesystem with the 'allow_other' flag (that's currently not possible,
because the remount_fs operation is not yet implemented).
