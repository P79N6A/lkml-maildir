   This patche moves common COMPATIBLE_IOCTLs to
   include/linux/compat_ioctl.h, enabling pretty nice cleanups:
Please be careful.  For anything non-trivial there can be major
differences between compat layers.
I say this now because eventually I want this compat stuff
to support multiple-compilations, using some COMPAT_NAME(foo)
macro scheme and some Makefile hackery.
This would allow, for example, x86_64 to have an x86_32 and
x86_32_sysv compat layer in one build.  So for example in this case
fs/compat.c would be built twice, once with x86_32 compat types
and once with x86_32_sysv types.
