No it is not. I had to set CONFIG_EMBEDDED on my P4 (definitely
not embedded) to get rid of PSAUX. My P4 uses a nice serial mouse,
and I neither need nor want kernel mouse support.
I can understand the desire to provide safe defaults for newbies
doing oldconfig on 2.4 .configs, but the !EMBEDDED implies mouse
change is too rigid.
