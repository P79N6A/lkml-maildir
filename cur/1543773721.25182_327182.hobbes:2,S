Slight tangent...  it would be nice if you would write a 2-line 
git-checkout-script, which provides the modern version of
	git-read-tree -m HEAD && git-checkout-cache -q -f -u -a
Note that I do depend on this command blowing away working dir changes, 
but maybe you would want that to be a separate arg.
Then you could add a "-u" arg, or somesuch, to the situations like git 
pull that want an up-to-date index.
