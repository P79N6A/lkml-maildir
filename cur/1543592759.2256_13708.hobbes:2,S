Ok, essentially same patch - good to see.  Seems old rule of thumb[1] for
linux patches still applies :)   I see you opted for a new var. to store
old use_sg value, rather than make use of SCpnt->old_use_sg like I did.
Was curious as to your reasoning for that - maybe I'm overlooking something.
Other thing that crossed my mind was the appropriateness of scsi_free()
doing a panic.  For this particular case, a BUG() would have been more
informative if we were relying on info in a bug report from Joe Average
to solve the problem. (Also, panic is a bit harsh if say CD is only SCSI
device and everything else is EIDE, but scsi_free has no way of knowing...)
Paul.
