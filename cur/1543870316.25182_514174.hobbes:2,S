I've uploaded them to:
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/archive/kevent/evserver_epoll.c
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/archive/kevent/evserver_kevent.c
I also changed client socket to nonblocking mode with the same result in
epoll server. If you will find it broken, please send me corrected to
test too.
