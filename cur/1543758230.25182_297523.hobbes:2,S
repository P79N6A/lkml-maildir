Indeed, I don't think 2.6.x got that merged, because it was never really 
clear _which_ fix was the right one (the extra locking was absolutely 
deadly for performance, the hacky one was a tad _too_ hacky ;)
Alan, did you ever decide what the proper locking would be? I've applied
the hacky "works by hiding the problem" patch for 2.6.11 which didn't have 
any subtle performance issues associated with it.
