Subject: [PATCH] Fix race condition in wait with thread groups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

There is code in sys_wait4() that makes a task wait for the children of all
members of the thread group.  This code has a race condition when more than
one task in a thread group calls wait.  Once it has picked a zomebie task
to return it drops the tasklist lock before it calls release_task().  This
allows another task to select the same zombie to clean up.
My fix for this race condition is to set the zombie task's state to a
different value before the tasklist lock is released.  This means no other
waiting task will select it.  There could be other ways of marking a task
as already selected for cleanup, but this seemed the simplest.
The patch is appended below.  It applies cleanly to 2.4.14
