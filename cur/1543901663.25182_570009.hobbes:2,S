Whether the timer expires or not is in many cases completely irrelevant.
You need special cases, where the timer wheel behaviour becomes an issue 
and whether hrtimer would behave any better in such situations is 
questionable.
Again, for the average user such details are pretty much irrelevant.

Stop spreading lies! :-(
One only has to look at the history of kernel/time/ntp.c
John's rather simple "HZ free ntp" patch wouldn't have been that simple 
without all the cleanup patches before that done by me, which were 
precisely intended to make this possible.

No, it's your prejudice against me based on wrong facts.
Get your facts straight and stop being an ass.
