It doesn't know that.
But if you restrict this guy's working set to a tiny amount
and just allow it to thrash away, then if nothing else, all
that wasted disk IO will slow all your other stuff down too.
However that is something we can allow you to tune, via RSS
limits. I am maintaining Rik's patch for that and will send
it on when rmap optimisation work is more finalised.
