well, maybe stupid ideas, but they're which supported on other unix like
system(s) or it would be very nice according to my experiences:
* bind mount support for all general mount options (nodev,ro,noexec etc)
  with SECURE implementation with any (maybe even future) filesystems?
* union mount (possible with option to declare on what fs a new file
  should be created: on fixed ones, random algorithm, on fs with the
  largest free space available etc ...)
* guaranteed i/o bandwidth allocation?
* netfilter's ability to do tricks which OpenBSD can do now with its
  packet filter
* ENBD support in official kernel with enterprise-class 'through the
  network' volume management
* more and more tunable kernel parameters to be able to have some user
  space program which can 'tune' the system for the current load,usage,etc
  of the server ("selftune")
* more configuration options to be able to use Linux at the low end as well
  (current kernels are too complex, too huge and sometimes contains too
  many unwanted features for a simple system, though for most times it is
  enough but can be even better)
* maybe some 'official in the kernel' general framework to implement
  virtual machines without the need to load third party kernel modeles
  from vmware, plex86 etc ...
