This part looks horrible:
+               spin_unlock(&inode_lock);
+               iput(inode);
+               spin_lock(&inode_lock);
Why not just split up the code inside iput(), and then just do
	if (atomic_dec(&inode->i_count))
		final_iput(inode);
where final_iput() _wants_ the spinlock held already?
That's basically what "iput()" will end up doing, except for that
"put_inode()" thing, which is just a horrible hack anyway.
So get rid of "put_inode()", and replace it with a new one that takes the
place of the
	if (!inode->i_nlink)  {
		... delete ..
	} else {
		.. free ..
	}
and makes that one be a "i_op->drop_inode" thing that defaults to the
current "delete if i_nlink is zero, free it if i_nlink is not zero and
nobody uses it".
The general VFS layer really shouldn't have assigned that strogn a meaning
to "i_nlink" anyway, it's not for the VFS layer to decide (and it only
causes problems for any non-UNIX-on-a-disk filesystems).
