The IKD patch has very intensive changes all over the place and it would
decrease the readability of the kerenl. kdb instead is very localized.

I try to avoid having to go through data structures via debugger. I prefer
adding printk in such cases. Often I also hack the sysrq keys to generate
stack traces and not only the EIP addresses. But that's my way I don't
