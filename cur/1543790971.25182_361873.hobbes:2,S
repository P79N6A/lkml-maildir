I've having trouble unloading a kernel module for a PCI card that I'm 
porting to 64bit linux.  It doesn't seem to be unloading correctly.  
It's tested, stable and unloads perfectly on a 32bit machine, running 
2.6.10 (and all other 32bit kernels I've tried).
However, on a 64bit machine (unofficial amd/emt64 debian with 2.6.8), 
even though it seems to unload corrrectly, I get a kernel oops if an 
application that uses the driver attempts to connect to the device after 
it's been unloaded.
Being relatively inexperienced at kernel programming, does this point to 
anything that might be obvious to any of you, yet not to me? :)   Or are 
there any common stumbling blocks in terms of unloading modules on 64bit 
linux.
Thanks for any suggestions.
James
