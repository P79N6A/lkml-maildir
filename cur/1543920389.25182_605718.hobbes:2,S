Sounds good.  Please make certain to test reiserfs as well as ext2+ as
it seems to strain the ramdisk code more aggressively.

My gut feel says my patches assuming everything tests out ok, as
they actually fix the problem instead of papering over it, and there
isn't really a size difference.
In addition the change to init_page_buffers is interesting all by
itself.  With that patch we now have the option of running block
devices in mode where we don't bother to cache the buffer heads
which should reduce memory pressure a bit.  Not that an enhancement
like that will show up in stable, but...
