The problem isn't really the southbridge, the problem is, that the
kernel doesn't seem to use (I still didn't get a definitive answer)
DMA when doing things with bigger blocksizes (grabbing audio CDs,
writing DAO CDs). That's why you don't have a problem burning 'normal'
TAO CDs. It seems that older chipsets just deal way better with PIO
modes (the PIIX3 doesn't have DMA, does it?).
For me it helped at least a bit to do the following:
- Disable interrupt sharing for IDE devices
- hdparm -d1 -c3 -u0 -X34/66 /dev/burner
With this settings I have 30% processor usage when writing at speed 20,
as opposed to at least 60% I had before.

Markus
