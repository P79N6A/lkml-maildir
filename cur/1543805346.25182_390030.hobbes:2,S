sysctls seem to be every bit as deprecated as /proc for what you are
tring to do.

My understanding is that only process-related stuff belongs in /proc
now.  Other random cruft that has accumulated over the years is left
there for backwards compatibility, but /sys interfaces are the way
forward now.
Some interfaces have already moved out of /proc in part or in whole, so
for example some ACPI functionality remains in /proc, while other bits
have moved to /sys/power.
The perfmon stuff may belong in a new hierarchy, for example
like /sys/class/pfm, or perhaps in /sys/devices/system/cpu.  Someone
like Greg K-H can put you to rights there.
