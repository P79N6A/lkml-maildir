Subject: 2.4.18: writeback of shared mmap'ed files broken?

A news server has two processes both accessing an "active" file.
This file is constantly being updated:
	cp /loc/news/lib/active /tmp/active
	sleep 1
	diff /loc/news/lib/active /tmp/active
		(differences)
However, its mtime does not change: it is days too old. Also, after
an unclean shutdown and reboot due to a power failure innd seemed to
operate on a very old version of the active file.
I don't think innd is calling msync() but IMHO that should not prohibit
the kernel from flushing out dirty pages at regular interval.
AFAIK there was a bug in the past with shared mmap'ed files but I thought
it was fixed a long time ago.
