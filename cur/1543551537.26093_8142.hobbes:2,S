I've found the problem.  This type of loop does not work:
do {
    alarm(t);
    read(fd);
    if (EINT)
       exception();
    else
       alarm(0);
} while (data);
There are some semantics here that differ from other *nix where this
works.  The read() won't come out when the alarm comes, and the socket
will effectively become broken.
Instead, it appears that I needed to use select(), which probably would
have been better in the first place anyway.
Thanks to anyone that took the time to look at this.
