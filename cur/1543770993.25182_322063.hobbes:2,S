What kind of driver are you writing, and what other driver is giving you 
this address?

Walking the page tables isn't guaranteed to work for all addresses on 
all arches.  On some you have to deal with large pages, on others you 
have parts of the address space that are mapped by different mechanisms. 
  This isn't something that drivers should be getting involved in.
