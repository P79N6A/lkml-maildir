You're a moron.
I'm the original author, and I selected the GPLv2 for Linux.
Tivo accepted that, and followed the GPLv2. Even the FSF lawyers agreed 
that they followed it.
But Tivo *is* the "author" of their own proprietary applications, and it 
*is* the designer of their hardware.
And exactly like I had the right to the choice of license when it comes to 
Linux, they have the right of choice to license and behaviour when it 
comes to *their* software and hardware (that is not a derived work of 
Linux).
But you cannot follow a coherent argument, because you dont' *want* to 
follow it. Because following the logical argument would take you to a 
place where you don't want to be.
I'm not going to bother discussing this any more. You don't seem to 
respect my right to choose the license for my own code.
So one final time:
 - I chose the GPLv2, fully understanding that the Tivo kind of situation 
   is ok.
 - the FSF lawyers too have acknowledged that what Tivo did was not a 
   license violation, so I obviously am not confused about the issue: YOU 
   are.
 - I think that what Tivo did was not only "technically valid" by the 
   license, it was what I *intended* by my choice of license!
And you are apparently totally unable to understand - or respect - that I 
actually made an informed decision that happens to be different from what 
you *wish* it were.
