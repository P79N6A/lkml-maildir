Sorted lists works deterministicly O(1) on UP if no owner of the lock
blocks while having the lock. On SMP or worse if an owner blocks in the
lock, the wait list can grow very long. Thus insertion of new elements
takes a long time - with preemption disabled :-(
If this is supposed to be used for user-space PI as well I would say it
would have to be completely bounded, i.e. plists are certainly needed.
If it is in the kernel only, you might argue that the code is under
control and thus not make very long wait-lists. Therefore it is
not worth the extra CPU cycles to use them. However, there is no way
to know for sure. In extreme load situations we could end up with a lot of
waiters on mmap_sem forinstance.
