I made a bad jugdement.
I'll repost a patch series for 2.6.22 fixes against Linus'tree, and a 
patch series for driver improvements against netdev-2.6#upstream, if it 
is acceptable.

We're actively working on RDMA improvements, leading to these FW updates.
Some of the changes are unfortunately not backward compatible, hence the 
exact matching the driver enforces.
The bundle driver/FW is getting finalized. New adapters will be shipped 
with the right image once it is available.
In the mean time, this is indeed a burden for the current users to get 
the corresponding FW.
