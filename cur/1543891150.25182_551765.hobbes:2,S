I guess you could just fail the page_mkwrite and have it try again? ..
that would require changing it not to always go SIGBUS though.

Just I have't sent the patch (because at the time there were no
page_mkwrite users to look at).
It is nicer too, because the nopage path only has  to call into
the filesystem once, to return the page (the filesystem can check
whether it is for write, and do the page_mkwrite thing at that
time). do_wp_page obviously still involves the extra call, and
that will be with a flag telling the fs that it isn't a "nopage"
fault, but a write fault on an existing page.

You could do that, but you'd have to probably check that it is
within i_size after you relock it, I think... yeah, that might
be the best thing for ocfs to do for now.
