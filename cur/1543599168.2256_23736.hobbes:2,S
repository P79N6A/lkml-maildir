I would be happy to run some other tests.  I was happy to see the kernel
compile prove faster, and I fully expected the dbench 16 results to show
an improvement.  But, while I assumed dbench 1 may show a degradation in
performance, I was surprised it was so high.
My main goal in updating Nigel's patches to recent kernels was to
accomplish just this: get some more data points, some more benchmarks,
and more eyes on the code and systems running the patch.
I am not an audio guy or otherwise in need of a lower-latency system,
but the possibility for an overall improvement in the kernel (even at
the expense of some cases) is worthwhile, to me.

Anyone running the patch want to profile some situations and reach some
conclusions?
