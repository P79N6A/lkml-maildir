Subject: [PATCH 0/3] i386: CS5535 chip support (Geode companion chip)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch series adds support for the AMD CS5535, which is the Geode
companion chip.  It targets the DIVIL (Diverse Integrated Logic)
components.
Patch 1 does the following:
 - verifies the existence of the CS5535 by checking the DIVIL signature
 - configures UART1 as a NS16550A
 - (optionally) enables UART2 and configures it as a NS16550A
 - (optionally) enables the SMBus/I2C interface
Patch 2 provides a simple GPIO char driver, modeled after the
scx200_gpio driver.
Patch 3 provides a SMBus/I2C driver, modeled after the scx200_acb driver.
