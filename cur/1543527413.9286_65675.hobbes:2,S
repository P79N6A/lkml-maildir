        Typically I do run the latest, however I couldn't get 2.3.47 to
work at all and I didn't have time to trouble-shoot it.  I figured
the patch was simple enough that it wouldn't really be an issue. Sorry.
        Incidently, whats the mailing address for linux-tulip?  I tried
the link off of Donald Becker's page but it wasn't working at the time.
