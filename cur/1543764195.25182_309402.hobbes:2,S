kzalloc it is, then.
By the way I did a quick measurement to see how much we could gain in 
kernel size by doing this. This is with a 2.6.11-rc2, defconfig kernel:
with kmalloc+memset:
    vmlinuz: 5521614
    bzImage: 2005274
with kzalloc:
    vmlinuz: 5513422
    bzImage: 2003927
So we gain 8kB on the uncompressed image and 1347 bytes on the 
compressed one. This was just a dumb test and actual results might be 
better due to smarter human cleanups.
Not a spectacular gain per se, but the increase in code readability is 
still worth it, IMHO.
