    Well, checking FSF's licenses page, there's an entry about a license
which *might* be the same as this:
"X11 License
This is a simple, permissive non-copyleft free software license,
compatible with the GNU GPL.
...
This license is sometimes called the "MIT" license, but that term is
misleading, since MIT has used many licenses for software."

    So my unreliable opinion is yes: This is
GPL-compatible-for-kernel-purposes.
    Cheers,
Felipe Damasio
