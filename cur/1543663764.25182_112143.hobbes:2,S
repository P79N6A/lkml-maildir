Albert, you, as a contributor to procps, have you ever run a high number
of (eg. more than 10K) threads and tested procps for that workload? Just
try it - start up eg. 10,000 threads (which just sleep) under 2.5.62, and
time all the various procps utilities. Then you'll see it first-hand,
where all the overhead lies.
