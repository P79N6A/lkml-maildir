Although this is correct as it is, it tirggers a latent bug
which is fixed by
commit fb93134dfc2a6e6fbedc7c270a31da03fce88db9
Author: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
Date:   Wed Nov 14 15:45:21 2007 -0800
    [TCP]: Fix size calculation in sk_stream_alloc_pskb
So please postpone it to the next round such that both patches
can be included together.
Thanks,
