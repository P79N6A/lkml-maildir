it also doesn't work for ro-open of a device that is rw-mounted, hdparm
-t as said a million of times now.

All filesystems marks the buffers dirty after modifying them. The
problem is that they don't always lock_buffer(); modify ; mark_dirty();
unlock_buffer(), so we cannot safely do the update-I/O from disk to
buffer cache on the pinned buffers or we risk to screwup the
filesystem while it's in the "modify; mark_dirty()" part.

I don't disallow it, I just don't guarantee coherency after that, the fs
could be screwedup if you rw-open + rw-mount and that's ok.
the case where it is not ok is hdparm: ro-open + rw-mounted.

Then you are making a special case "the device was opened read-only in
which case it obviously doesn't need to flush anything to disk" means
you are not running the update_buffers() if the open was O_RDONLY (if
you make this special case you would be safe on that side).  But also
the user may do O_RDWR open and not modify the device, and still we must
not screwup a rw-mountd fs under it.
as far I can tell my synchronization code is the simpler possible and
it's completly safe, without changing the synchronization API with the
pinned buffers, or without making getblk to be backed on the blkdev
pagecache enterely that has larger impact on the kernel.
Making getblk to be blkdev pagecache backed seems the cleaner way to get
rid of those aliasing issues to be allowed to just limit the very latest
close to a __block_fsync + truncate_inode_pages() [which is a 5 lines
cleanup compared to my current state of the patch], with it not even the
last blkdev release will run the block_fsync since the fs still holds a
reference on the same side, the fs will be just another blkdev user like
if it came from userspace. However this logic is potentially more
invasive than the blkdev-pagecache code that matters and it doesn't
provide a single advantage to the user, so this isn't in my top list at
the moment, sounds 2.5 cleanup material.
