it does not really hang, it just tries to initialize every target of the
HBA (here: from sym0:0:0: to sym0:15:0, see [1] for more info) and it is
so busy with it that the bootprocess seems to hang. after failing with the
last target, booting continues just fine. (i have no disks attached,
booting via nfsroot)

[1] it's all here: 
http://nerdbynature.de/bits/hal/2.6.11-rc3/
(yes, they are from different dates, but the setup is the same. the
kernelversion from messages is 2.6.11-rc2, the rest is all 2.6.11-rc3,
from vanilla (-BK) sources)
thanks,
Christian.
