Er, consider the case of count == 1. Fenceposts can be dangerous things.

Hello,
This is the code I got from 2.4.20:
char * strncpy(char * dest,const char *src,size_t count)
{
	char *tmp = dest;
	while (count-- && (*dest++ = *src++) != '\0')
		/* nothing */;
	return tmp;
}
I don't see any problem with this code, and if we don't need to NULL-pad
the dest string, we do not have to.  It is not in the definition of
strncpy().  So we don't need the second while {};
I'm hoping we're looking at the same thing.
Regards,
Anthony Dominic Truong.
