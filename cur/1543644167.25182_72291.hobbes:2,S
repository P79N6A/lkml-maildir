Hello Justin, hello all,
I just came across an interesting phenomenon regarding 2.4.19 / 2.4.20-pre7 and
adaptec scsi. Scene is this:
board: Asus SP97-V with Pentium 200 (non-MMX) (I know it is old)
controllers tried: adaptec 29160, 29160N, 2940 U2W
kernel: 2.4.18-SuSE (distribution 8.0), 2.4.19, 2.4.20-pre7
From all possible configurations of the above the following work:
kernel 2.4.18-SuSE: with all controllers
kernel 2.4.19     : only with 2940 U2W
kernel 2.4.20-pre7: only with 2040 U2W
All other configurations with newer adaptecs and recent kernels fail during
init of controller. Last message in sight: "PCI: Sharing interrupt xxx"
I tried all interrupts from 5-14 and configurations with other pci devices
plugged in or not. The problem stays the same.
I really wonder what they did to 2.4.18 so that this one works... ??
Any suggestions?
Regards,
Stephan
