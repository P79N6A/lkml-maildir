OK, the vunmap batching code wipes your TLB flushing and IPIs off
the table. Diffstat below, but the TLB portions are here (besides that
_everything_ is probably lower due to less TLB misses caused by the
TLB flushing):
      -170   -99.4% sn2_send_IPI
      -343  -100.0% sn_send_IPI_phys
    -17911   -99.9% smp_call_function
Total performance went up by 30% on a 64-way system (248 seconds to
172 seconds to run parallel finds over different huge directories).
     23012  54790.5% _read_lock
      9427   329.0% __get_vm_area_node
      5792     0.0% __find_vm_area
      1590  53000.0% __vunmap
       107    26.0% _spin_lock
        74   119.4% _xfs_buf_find
        58     0.0% __unmap_kernel_range
        53    36.6% kmem_zone_alloc
      -129  -100.0% pio_phys_write_mmr
      -144  -100.0% unmap_kernel_range
      -170   -99.4% sn2_send_IPI
      -233   -59.1% kfree
      -266  -100.0% find_next_bit
      -343  -100.0% sn_send_IPI_phys
      -564   -19.9% xfs_iget_core
     -1946  -100.0% remove_vm_area
    -17911   -99.9% smp_call_function
    -62726    -7.2% _write_lock
   -438360   -64.2% default_idle
   -482631   -30.4% total
Next I have some patches to scale the vmap locks and data
structures better, but they're not quite ready yet. This looks like it
should result in a further speedup of several times when combined
with the TLB flushing reductions here...
