You don't get it do you. Our source code is meaningless to the Open
Source community at large. It is only useful to our tiny set of
competitors that have nothing to do with Linux. The Embedded space is
very specific. We are only _using_ Linux. Just as we could have used
VxWorks or OSE. Using our source code would not benefit anybody but
our competitors. Sure we could make our drivers open-source. This is a
decision that is made FIRST when evaluating an OS. If we we were
required to make our drivers/HW open, we would just not have chosen
Linux. It is as simple as that.
