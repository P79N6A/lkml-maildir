Ever thought about strict firewalling by someone's provider. For system
administrators of large public networks it is normal to close port 1024
and lower, and explicitly allow access over port 80, 21.. (and possible
other services).
So we would generally want to stick to port 80. But if we _would_ use eg.
port 81, we would still need/want a user_space deamon. And here we are
again for it would have to check if it is supposed to load that file
(someone tries to fetch other stuff over port 81), and it would all in all
be better to just integrate the code in the main khttpd.
And think of all the fuss you would get from using another port, you would
have to write you pages with another port (also you would need to specify
the entire URL for these things), or you could let the server take care of
it, which would overhead, and that was one of the things we wanted to
prevent.
