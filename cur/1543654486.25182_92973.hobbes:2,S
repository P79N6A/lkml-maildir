Sigh:
Just tried reversing the process (ie. exchanging the client/server
role): No trouble at all, no errors in files.
I just tried turning off DMA on the server disk (this is just a low-end
IDE-system): No errors in files (compressing the file thrice).
So it does not at all seem to be a NFS-issue!
I have no idea what is wrong. If the disk, cable or IDE controller does
bit-flipping when DMA is turned on, why is the problem only seen with
NFS? I have never seem corrupted files or metadata with DMA turned
(except once long ago, when I experimented with high-transfer-modes - I
haven't done that since)...
Thanks for your help!
