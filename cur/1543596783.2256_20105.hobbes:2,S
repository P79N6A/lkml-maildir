The actual call trace is:
__set_page_dirty
filemap_sync_pte
filemap_sync_pte_range 
filemap_sync_pmd_range 
filemap_sync
msync_interval
sys_msync
We're crashing because __set_page_dirty dereferences page->mapping,
but pages from a mmap() of /dev/mem seem to have a NULL ->mapping.
One of the very frustrating things about Linux kernel development
is that the main source of tuition is merely the source code. You
can stare at that for months (as I have) and still not have a firm
grasp on the big-picture semantic *meaning* behind something as
simple as a page having a null ->mapping.  Sigh.
So one is reduced to mimicry:
