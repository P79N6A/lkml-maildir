Subject: Bug in 2.4.9: Joydev module has incorrect version number

I am using kernel 2.4.9. All the joystick stuff is in using the M options. 
When going modprobe joydev it can't find it. When using insmod to specifiy 
the exact name of the file, it says that it can't find the correct kernel 
version.
I'd also like to ask for 2.6 to have a feature that will automatically detect 
all hardware, and load the correct drivers. I'm sick of having to do all 
sorts of stuff to get hardware to go. Why can't it just work? Thanks,
David
