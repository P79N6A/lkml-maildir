   Of course, but we need to solve it for modules as well :-(
   I think that we should define some way of matching PCI slots with specific
device names, so that the user can define things like `eth0 is the ethernet
card in PCI slot 00:01' and so on. Devfsd seems to be the ideal place for
such things, we just need to make devfs export the PCI location of the cards
to user space.
				Have a nice fortnight
