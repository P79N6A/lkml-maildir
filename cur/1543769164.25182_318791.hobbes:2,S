hello,
        Is there any way in linux kernel network stack
at IP layer before adding IP header to know that
packet is transmitted to eth1 or forwarded to eth1 if
linux machine has 2 NIC's eth0 and eth1?
       I check net_device structre and found that
ifindex is the field that gives proper incoming packet
network interface at IP layer but same for packet
trasmission not works.
regards,
cranium
