I am not sure if I understand what you were trying to say. If
CONFIG_PCI_SORT_BY_BUS_SLOT_FUNC is not set, you should be able to 
pass "pci=bussort" to kernel to sort the PCI device by bus, slot and
function. Did I miss something?

The whole purpose of my patch is to change PCI driver probe order in
such a way that is BIOS independent.
