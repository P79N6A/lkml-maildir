I'm actually more inclined to try to deprecate /dev/kmem.. I don't think 
anybody has ever really used it except for some rootkits. It only exists 
in the first place because it's historical.
We do need to support /dev/mem for X, but even that might go away some 
day. 
So I'd be perfectly happy to fix this, but I'd be even happier if we made 
the whole kmem thing a config variable (maybe even default it to "off").
