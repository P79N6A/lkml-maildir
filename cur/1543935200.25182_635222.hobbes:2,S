wow, thanks, it works, this is so obvious.
I tend to use values like bs=512000 or suchlike, but probably never
stroke this particular value when I was looking at iostat.
Must've missed that modulo 4096 somehow.
Seems like cp is using 512B per transaction, judging by how slow the
transfer goes. If I use bs=500000 or even bs=1024, it goes faster.
Have a nice day :-}
