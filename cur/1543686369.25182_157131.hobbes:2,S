hw prefetch has nothing to do with how the linux kernel uses prefetch.
It's only using it for data structures that cannot be handled by
the auto prefetcher.
[except the broken 3dnow! copy that was never enabled]

All XPs have.

In 2.4 distribution users never got anything. That is what was really
broken.

My AMD manual lists it as part of 3dnow. If an CPU advertises 3dnow!
but doesn't have the instruction it's broken.

I would consider the MII broken then. setup should clear the 3dnow
bit.

there is 3dnowext, set on Athlons, but K6 has prefetchw too and
it 
But if you only want Athlon you can check for X86_FEATURE_K7.
The problem is that it doesn't include K8 and K8
has prefetchw too (alternative currently only allows a single 
bit, not a bitmask). Better is to either clear 3dnow on the MII
or define a new pseudo bit that defines working and useful 
prefetchw

No for weird combinations you define a new pseudo CPUID capability 
bit, check for that in the CPU detection and use that in the alternative.
If you really want 3 way alternative you can just define a macro
for it. The basic data structure supports it - the macro
just needs to have two .altinstructions records and two replacement codes. 
But I have my doubt it is worth it for this case.
No stinkin' ifdefs please, that would break the whole concept.

Nope, no misalignment. All it does is to just handle the exception
using __ex_table and jumps to the next instruction.
[the exceptions are very rare, they need very specific circumstances
in the CPU to trigger, so it's ok to make it slow]
Only trap is that you have to add the exception table sorting too...
