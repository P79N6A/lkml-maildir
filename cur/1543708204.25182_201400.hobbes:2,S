a directory is a file. it has got its own rights, that are rights 
referred to that particular file. maybe you should not allow people to 
use ls and make them use your own ls_patched but they still could give a 
"echo *" command which would be expanded by bash or other shells... 
so... what could you do with that? are you going to patch any shell you 
give access to?
let me know, it's quite interesting...
cheers
