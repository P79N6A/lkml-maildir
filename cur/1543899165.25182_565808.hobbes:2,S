Hmm. Perhaps I missed something, perhaps you... Or we both :)
try_to_wake_up() can choose new_cpu which differs from initial ->cpu.
Then it does set_task_cpu() which just sets ->cpu, it doesn't check
can_migrate_task(). This means that the task could be waken on another
CPU, even if it sleeps under migration_disable().
Btw, I think you should also fix debug_smp_processor_id(), it won't
like  migration_disable() + __get_cpu_var().
Oleg.
