Just put this in a loop and time it. Change SIZE to long long, and do
it again! It doesn't scale well. The long long code is nearly 10 times
slower! You can do `gcc -S -o xxx name.c` and see why.
#define SIZE long 
SIZE *foo()
{
    SIZE one;
    SIZE two;
    static SIZE answer[8];
    one = 1;
    two = 2;
    answer[0] = one - two;
    answer[1] = two - one;
    answer[2] = one + two;
    answer[3] = two + one;
    answer[4] = two / one;
    answer[5] = one / two;
    answer[6] = one * two;
    answer[7] = two * one;
    return answer;
}
Long long things, even it they work well, are not very nice on 32 bit
machines. For the time being, I'd advise increasing cluster size rather
than using 64 bit values.
In a few years, even Intel machines will be 64 bits. Int will still be
long, but it will be 64 bits. ---and they will autoscale for backwards
compatibility (one new instruction, used once, for oprand size).
Cheers,
