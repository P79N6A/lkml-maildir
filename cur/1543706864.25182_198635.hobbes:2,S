"System time" is amount of time elapsed since the epoch.  Period.  What does
it have to any timezone?
The only place where timezone enters the picture is conversion of time to
year:month:day:hours:minutes:seconds and that's
	a) process-dependent and
	b) done outside of kernel
The same goes for file names.  Filename is a sequence of bytes, no more and
no less.  Anything beyond that belongs to applications.
