You end up with a lot more things running asynchronously. In the current
world we see a series of requests for attributes and hopefully we do
readahead and all is neatly ordered. If fibrils are not ordered the same
way then we could make it worse as we might not pick the right readahead
for example.

If we stick to that limit it ought to be ok. We've been busy slapping
people who call sys_*, except for internal magic like kernel_thread
