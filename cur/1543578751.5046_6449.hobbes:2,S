Please can we also stop HPT366 from attempting UDMA66 on the IBM DTLA
drives, while we're at it? I don't care if it's done by blacklisting the
DTLA drives, as was done by the patch I resent numerous times, or if it's
done the other way round by putting known-compatible drives (include
"FUJITSU MPE3136AT") into a whitelist. But it needs doing.
