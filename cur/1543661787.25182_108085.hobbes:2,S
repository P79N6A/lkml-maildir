If the code is correct, it really should be written as:
   for (new2size = 128; new2size < newsize; new2size <<= 1)
       ;
The code seems to want to make the value of new2size a power of
2 and, greater than 128, but less than newsize. It ignores the
fact that newsize might be less than 128, maybe this is okay.
But, the code goes on, eventually settling on new2size being
less than 4096... hmmm. I'll bet this could be greatly
simplified. I think 'new2size' is really something that will
fit inside 128-byte groups. Maybe an & or a % will greatly
simplify?
