I hope atleast bootp stays in.  I wouldn't want to have to create an initrd
that has to be downloaded (slowing boot).
Another one.  At work, I use a boot disk that basically just has the kernel
cat'd to the disk.  No bootloader so initrd would be useless since there's
no way to get the initrd image nor anyway of getting an IP to get it.
IMO, bootp should stay in.
