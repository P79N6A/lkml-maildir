There are problems:
- There is no "root" in a capability system, you have to get rid of
  "privileged users" completely. Better do it right the first time around
  rather than "fix" it by a endless series of ever hairier patches
- The idea of keeping capabilities in the file itself invites capability
  smuggling, better if programs that don't know about capabilities can't
  handle them at all: No dumb tar(1), no hexeditor, no cp(1), ...
- This is a ELF-only kludge. What about a Web server written in Perl? CGIs
  written in Java that need extra privileges?
