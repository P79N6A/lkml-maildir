Seems to me this is an identical problem to the IP firewall/ forward/
accounting/ masquerade thing. We just put a callback hook at the relevant
places. If the user compiled without beancounting, the hook gets left out.
If the user hasn't installed any policy, the hook call gets skipped.
The hook can be setup to be code identical to the traditional ulimit stuff
or a flexible netfilter-style chain (with ulimit emulation of course). The
user can then build up a policy chain including forwarding to userspace or
passing it through special modules. Policy options could including
killing, suspending, renicing, etc. This also addresses the OOM problem -
the user can now setup a policy not to kill X or init, for instance.
Quota, of course, is the same problem set.
