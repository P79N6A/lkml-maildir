The "right" way to do this is to have a "this spot is in use, but you
don't understand it" indication for an inode (*). The "expansion ptr"
can then normally point to the directly following inode, but also
somewhere completely different.
So a "new" system would allocate a new inode in the directly following
spot. But when a "new" system would need the extension part on an old
filesystem, it would allocate the nearest inode and point the
extension ptr there.

(*) Actually the kernel only needs the "it's in use" part. fsck needs
to know what it means or to properly ignore it....
