Apply them in any order (perhaps starting with the bigger one).
While patch runs, it prints out diagnostic messages.
If one reads "... Hunk failed ..." it generates files like
config.in 
config.in.rej
config.in.orig
Then you have to open config.in.rej look at the lines with "-" and "+"
in front and apply the patch manually to "config.in".
I would search with 
/usr/src/linux# find . -name "*.rej"
and apply the above procedure to every found file, deleting the .rej 
and .orig when done.
