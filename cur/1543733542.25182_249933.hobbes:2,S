I think most projects' goals is to reduce the number of patches they need
to make to the kernel instead of increasing them...  If you think it is
ugly to have multiple EXPORT_SYMBOLS() then it should just be moved to
the line after the function definition.  Having to add another configure
rule to check for now-unexported symbols isn't my idea of time well spent
(not that I care about this one in particular).
Cheers, Andreas
