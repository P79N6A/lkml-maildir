Super. I guess it's not in mainline yet. Or it wasn't yesterday.

Oh. From looking at the code I assumed I need to set sched_rt_ratio to 65536.
I guess you changed things around a bit. I'll look at the latest changes.

Reduces code size and RT scheduler complexity for the cases when these features are not required.
For example my preference would for RT scheduler to be as lean as possible to avoid any kind of 
overhead and cache pollution. I know both watchdog and throttling end up being a single if() when
disabled via sysctl, but it all adds up.

Currently it's per process. Most RT apps will most likely have several RT threads.
