I've been running e2compr on all production systems (mine included)
for years. It's never given the slightest problem. I'm probably
the only person that knows it's there. 2.0.36 and 2.2.10 kernels
nowadays. 0.3.9 e2compr stuff (sorry Peter, you know about that).
The drawback is that one has to remember to distribute patched e2fsck.
I think things would be clearer if e2compr appeared as a separate
file system type, requiring mount -t e2c, for example. Then it
could never be confused with ext2/3, and one would explicitly
require a separate fsck.e2c executable instead of a patched e2fsck.
