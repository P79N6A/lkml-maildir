On my redhat 7.1 machine I have been using the 2.4.0 redhat kernel and
mounting ISO's to loop devices and it worked fine.  I upgraded to a 2.4.2
kernel and now none of the ISO's will mount.  They all hang when the
command is run.  Are there any other known occurences of this?
I am not on the list so if there some issue that you would like to tell me
or if you need more information please write me back directly.
