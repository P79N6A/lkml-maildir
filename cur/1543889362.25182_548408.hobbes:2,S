mac-intel are totally standard Intel chipsets. They have all of 
conf1/conf2/mmconfig afaik.
I just happily booted my mac-mini with "pci=nommconf", nothing bad 
happened, and the kernel says
	PCI: Using configuration type 1
and I don't think you even _can_ disable conf1 type accesses: they are 
deep in the Intel chipsets.
Of course, in a virtualized environment, anything can happen. Virtual 
machines prefer mmconf, because you can use page-level remapping to hide 
devices or make pseudo-devices show up by mapping in pages that have 
nothing to do with the true hardware.
So no, I don't think Alan was totally smoking crack when he talked about 
"trusted" computing. Read the above paragraph a few times. (You can do it 
with trapping IO port accesses too, but it's going to cost you a lot, so 
if you want to make a fast but untrustoworthy setup, MMIO is the better 
option).
