Well, imagine that somebody develops a server implementation (well, that 
was what some friends and me did in the past few days) than it is just 
good to know, that there is a limit for the length field of the 
request-packet. If there is no limit, the server implementation has to 
be abled to answer requests of any size. That is very complicated.
For example if the server has only 64MB of memeory, and the kernel would 
be abled to send a 128MB request, how would you handle that?
