           Summary: Samba breaks in test6 kernel
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0test7
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: acme@conectiva.com.br
         Submitter: freelsjd@ornl.gov
Distribution: Debian/Sid
Hardware Environment: dual Xeon 2.4 Ghz
Software Environment: Samba 3.0.0
Problem Description:
In going from 2.6.0test6 to 2.6.0test7, the ability to "Map a network drive"
from Windows to this machine failed.  I have confirmed in going back to test6, 
the problem went away.  I have also confirmed that older versions of Samba had 
the same problem.  I have narrowed it down to the test7 kernel.
Steps to reproduce:
Have a Debian/Sid system with current Samba installed.  Upgrade from test6 to 
test7, and the problem occurs.
