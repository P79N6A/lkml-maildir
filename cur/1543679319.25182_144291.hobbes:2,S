Can't make XMMS skip audio with "while true; do a = 2; done" while
playing moving windows under an X session.

Well, you're not talking to yourself. We're listening and testing:
2.5.73-mm2 + patch-O1int + patch-granularity + patch-1000HZ. With this
new version of the patch, the mouse cursor jumpiness has returned again,
altough in much less extent than in previous versions: it's more
difficult to reproduce, but it's present just when logging onto my KDE
session on a Red Hat Linux 9 box. For the rest of the session, it's
pretty hard difficult to make the mouse cursor to turn jumpy.

Under heavy load (3 simulatenous consoles doing while true; do a=2;
done), X feels smooth, but moving windows aggresively, makes X go jerky
for a few seconds and some process do starve a little when repainting.
Anyways, at a first glance, it looks really good :-)
