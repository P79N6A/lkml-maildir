Ok, ksm does make the cache of the cpu dirty when scanning the pages
(but the scanning happen slowly slowly and cache usually get dirty much 
faster)
But infact it improve the cache by the fact that it make many ptes point 
to the same page
so if before we had 12 process touching 12 diffrent physical page they 
would dirty the page
but now they will touch just one...
so i guess it depend on how you see it...
