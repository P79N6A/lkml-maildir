Later 2.2.x (x>=11 or so) has no limitations on fds/procs, other than what you set 
with ulimit and the global limit (/proc/sys/fs/{file,inode}-max) 
2.2.x before that need to be recompiled for more than 1024 fds/proc and they
will also waste a lot of memory for high settings.
Some older library functions may cause problems though when they use select() 
and you pass a fd>=1024 to them.
