We beat a recent 2.6 up with specweb on ppc64 and got the transmit
timeout errors within about 30 seconds. Disabling TSO made the problem
go away. (I actually hacked the driver forgetting we can do it via
ethtool these days).
Scott: it smells like the TSO early write back issue, perhaps the new
version of the fix isnt working properly. I need to verify that turning
TSO on/off via ethtool has the same effect.
