This is, umm, a non-elegant way of handling things once you switch your 
driver to the new PCI driver probe model :-(
Of course, I'm personally of the opinion that people need to quite 
thinking in terms of host order anyway and let things like mount by volume 
solve this issue anyway.  It's cleaner, it works regardless of the driver, 
and it puts the burden of finding the right root partition in user space 
where it's easier to fix up should things change, etc.  Just my opinion.
