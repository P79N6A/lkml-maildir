I don't believe the spec addresses that.
The rules we use in HA are that each bus entity supplies termpwr (i.e.
all initiators and targets) and each terminator draws its power from the
bus).  Thus the bus is properly terminated until the last device powers
down.
You have to jumper this specially on most SCSI cards (especially if
they're at the end of the bus and have internal termination).
