I think you two are talking straight past each other.  Andries is
talking about the fsid, which is determined by the NFS server, based on
its idea of the device number of the filesystem underlying the exported
directory.  Right now, I can reboot my host system, and when it comes
up then the NFS directories it exports to clients will have the same
fsid.  With random device numbers it won't work; after rebooting the
NFS server all clients will be forced to explicitly unmount and
remount.
Now, it seems to me that this isn't much of an argument against random
device numbers.  Have userspace set a UUID for the device if you want,
and use that in the fsid instead.  But that's the argument; it has
nothing to do with the NFS server exporting its /dev.
