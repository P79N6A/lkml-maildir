But does it _matter_ that the thing is mounted or dismounted as a unit?  And
if so, why?

Why does the automounter daemon have to do the mounting of submounts?  What's
wrong with having the kernel do it?  The one problem with having the kernel do
it that I can see, is that the kernel doesn't update /etc/mtab.
Note that rather than manually mounting the submounts, you could just open and
close those directories as that should cause them to automount - though the
xdev mountpoints will expire and become automatically unmounted after a
certain period.
