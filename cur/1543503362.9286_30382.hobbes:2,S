 I'm writing a simple fall-through filesystem (just logs what's called then
calls the default operation for whatever was requested). I'm filling up a
file_operations struct with stuff like:
static loff_t findfs_llseek(file_t *file, loff_t offset, int origin)
{
   printk("Tryed to seek into file %ld\n", file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_ino);
   return default_llseek(file, offset, origin);
}
 I can find the default_llseek(), generic_file_{read,write}, and a few
others. Where can I find the default functions for doing a readdir(),
ioctl(), open(), release(), fsync() and a poll() ?
