I'd absolutly go to fcntl().  As bad as dotlocking is for
journaling filesystems it is even worse for NFS (when it works).
Look at the lkml thread "invalidate_inode_pages in 2.5.32/3"
to get an idea.  Multiply the directory invalidations by the
size of the directories.  fcntl() is the preferred way of locking
over NFS as it will even report if there is a problem with
lockd.
