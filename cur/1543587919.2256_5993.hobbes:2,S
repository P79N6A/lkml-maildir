At least in the 2.4 kernels, there's already a __d_path() routine (fs/dcache.c)
that builds the pathname using the mechanism you discussed.
Here's one way you could use it:
char *
kgetcwd()
{
	char *path = (char *) __get_free_page(GFP_USER);
        struct vfsmnt *pwdmnt;
        struct dentry *pwd;
        if (!path)
                return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);
        read_lock(&current->fs->lock);
        pwdmnt = mntget(current->fs->pwdmnt);
        pwd = dget(current->fs->pwd);
        read_unlock(&current->fs->lock);
        spin_lock(&dcache_lock);
        path = __d_path(pwd, pwdmnt, NULL, NULL, path, PAGE_SIZE);
        spin_unlock(&dcache_lock);
        mntput(pwdmnt);
        dput(pwd);
        return path;
}
If you only want the pathname back to the process root, use d_path() instead
(and don't grab the dcache_lock).
When you're done with path, free it with free_page() and not kfree().
BTW, I'm not subscribed to the kernel mailing list (I just read it on the web),
so please copy me on any response.
