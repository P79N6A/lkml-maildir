NFR uses a BSD API which Linux doesn't support.
Under Linux, one syscall per-packet is required, which quite
seriously limits the rate at which packets can be sniffed.  It's
not exactly a "sad commentary" - it's missing feature which
proves to be a deficiency for this application.
I imagine that something like
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/lbl-tools/kernel-turbopacket.dif.gz
might help to rectify the situation.
Matthew.
