OK. BTW, while driver_attach is global it is not exported. Should I mark both
of them EXPORT_GPL_ONLY?

Well, I need to be able to work with a specific port so when I am doing
	echo -n "serio_raw" > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serio1/driver
I want only serio1 be affected, not every disconnected port that can work
with serio_raw. driver_attach() will claim all of them. 
The difference is that serio system allows you to have several drivers
that can drive the same hardware and user gets to chose which driver gets
the honors. I.e given 4 PS/2 ports in the system user might want to have
raw access to port #2 (via serio_raw) while using standard psmouse driver
for the rest of them. With PCI if you have 2 drivers and 2 exactly same
cards you do not have ability to bind first driver to one of the cards and
second driver to the other.
