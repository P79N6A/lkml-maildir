Shrug, that's your opinion.  My real life experience is some what
different - I'm the one admin'ing these machines so I can see what's
going on.

Meanwhile you decide that you have a right over _MY_ personal preferences.
It's the same argument I'm afraid, just a different point of view.  If
_you_ do not wish to abide by the header then turn off that feature in
your mailer.  That's _your_ preference and one which _you_ can set.

Well, that will leave me with _no_ _choice_ but to arrange for the
SMTP MAIL FROM from others to receive a 550 error code to remove
the problem.  Is that really what you'd like me to do?

That's not the issue.
Since it's obvious that you don't accept my argument, it's pointless
discussing it further; there's nothing I can realistically do at this
end to resolve the issue and still remain part of this community.
I see no point in further discussion of this issue if such bigotry is
going to continue; any further responses on this topic will not receive
any replies from me.
