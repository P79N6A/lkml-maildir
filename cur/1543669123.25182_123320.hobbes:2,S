For reasons reported in another mail (ac97 fails to build) my attempt at 
pre7 failed. Also, as far as I know, the FastTrak feature enables the 
Promise RAID mode: I am not using that. Instead, I just want 4 IDE disks 
which will be bound using Linux raid5.
Are you saying you want to know if the Promise mode works (independent of 
whether I wish to use it?)
