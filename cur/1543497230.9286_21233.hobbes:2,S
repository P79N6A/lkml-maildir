Hi,
  I have a problem with your patch:

  in both 2.2.9 and 2.3.3 kernel code continues with:
        if (read_this_time < to_read) {
           break;
        }
So code should exit from this loop if read_this_time is not equal to to_read.
So it will not quit only if 'to_read==0'. And 'to_read' can be zero only
'count==already_read'. And if 'already_read >= count', we do not enter
to this loop... So could you send me testcase? In any case, you should
simple 'break' out of the loop, otherwise reading at the end will give
'-EFAULT' (for example 'cat /file/on/ncpfs' will end with this error).

Do you know about linux/MAINTAINERS file? It has one nice entry called
'NCP FILESYSTEM' :-)

Could you try 2.2.10-pre1 or 2.3.4-pre1 (& newer)? There are some changes
in pagefault mmap handling code, maybe that your problems came from that bug.
                                            Best regards,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
