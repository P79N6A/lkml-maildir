Hmm I thought it was obvious with the description in paranthesis after
the option. Basically the option is just an optimized default for 1GB of
RAM, like the 2G option is tailored for 2GB of low mem on a 2GB machine.
The reason the option exists is of course to leave the default at the
older not-so-great option for 1G of RAM.
