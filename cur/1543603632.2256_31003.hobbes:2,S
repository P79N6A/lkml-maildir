 Hello!
 Current NAPI incarnation came first for 2.4.3 and holds ANK trademark.
 Jamal had pre-NAPI patches long before and we have been testing/profiling
 polling and flow control versions of popular network drivers in the lab and 
 on on highly loaded Internet sites for a long time. I consider the NAPI
 work to initiated by Jamal at OLS two years ago. No I don't know of any 
 usable code for 2.2.*
 Cheers.
