Ah, like so?
Rusty, do you feel this makes the conversion less of a step backward?
If not, Andrew, as Rusty pointed out, stop_machine.c does not fall into
the set of kernel_thread users which need to be updated either for the
deprecation or to deal with pid namespaces, and perhaps my previous
patch should not be applied after all.
thanks,
