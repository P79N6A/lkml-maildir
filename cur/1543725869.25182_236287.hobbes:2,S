Well, what I hate about various computer programs is that they seem to assume 
to know what I (the USER) want and they don't let me do anything else that 
they "know" what I should/would do. ;-)

Can you please tell me why you think that the least tunable implementation 
should be the best/most desirable one?  I always prefer the most tunable 
implementations which is quite opposite to what you have said, but this is my 
personal opinion, of course.
