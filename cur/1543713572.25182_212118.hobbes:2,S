this is being done to keep things simple and fast - to avoid the
special-cases (hotplug hooks) in various bits of scheduler code.

nice. The best thing is that your patch also removes a special-case from
the hot path.

btw., there's now an enqueue_task_head() function in the -mm scheduler
[to do cache-cold migration], if you build ontop of -mm you'll have one
less infrastructure bit to worry about.
the question is, how much actual latency does the current 'freeze
everything' solution cause? We should prefer simplicity and
debuggability over cleverness of implementation - it's not like we'll
have hotplug systems on everyone's desk in the next year or so.
also, even assuming a hotplug CPU system, CPU replacement events are not
that common, so the performance of the CPU-down op should not be a big
issue. The function depends on the # of tasks only linearly, and we have
tons of other code that is linear on the # of tasks - in fact we just
finished removing all the quadratic functions.
