there might be some confusion here. Google for "mcount tracing utility"

it derives from the same latency tracer code that we wrote for -rt that 
has been around for years:
   
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/latency-tracing-patches/
we renamed the concept to 'ftrace' during pre-merge cleanups, perhaps 
that is what caused you to not recognize this? (mcount is a confusing 
name and ties it to a gcc feature while there's nothing gcc specific 
about this concept.)
