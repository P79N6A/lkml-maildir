That doesn't mean we can't change it if it's wrong.

I dislike strings.  They make it look as if you have a nice extensible
interface, where in reality you have a poorly documented interface which
leads to poor interoperability.
I prefer nice structure where you can see all the limitations immediately.

PCI means that you can reuse all of the platform's infrastructure for
irq allocation, discovery, device hotplug, and management.  You can
write it for new guests but backporting it to older guests will be a
huge task.
We will support non-pci for s390, but in order to support Windows and
older Linux PCI is necessary.
