Okay, It's a real process that has its own context.

You can't use the user-mode syscalls! You need to use the kernel
procedures to which they trap (like sys_open(), etc.). The reason
is that you are operating on the kernel stack, you then generate a
trap for the system call, which starts over again on the kernel
stack (overwriting your previous return addresses, etc.).
A kernel-mode daemon has a context of its own, but it shares
kernel data and stack.
