Hi!
We have exactly the same problem, which is definitely a Oops condition
(I could read it once on screen...).
The problem occurs under both 2.2.5 and 2.2.6, with one or two (dual
Intel PII 450MHz on asus) processors, and it is fs (vfs?) related. We
could reproduce the pb with Adaptec 2940UW hardware and
NCR53c875/tekkram adapters. We have a cyclone ethernet board also. The
box was perfectly stable under 2.0.x.
Any idea?
