Well, I'm not sure about which SNTP counters you are talking, but I suppose
it is not about per-filtering-rule counters, but something like per-interface
counters, etc.
There's always a way for somebody with root access to reset the counters of
a rule: 
just delete and re-insert the rule.
If somebody wants to reset the counter, he can. If we remove the functionality
from iptables, people still can - but it's more difficult.
