I've since found that in the suspend2 code, I was working around this
problem before by not calling the prepare method. I've just today
modified the Suspend code so that it calls prepare for all of the
powerdown methods and everything is working fine without reverting the
patch. I guess this is your better fix if you're a suspend2 user. If
not, are there other circumstances in which you're seeing the computer
fail to powerdown?
Regards,
Nigel
