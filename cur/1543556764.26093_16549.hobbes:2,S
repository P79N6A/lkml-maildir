Why bother, Calimetrics has a native driver solution that does a
modulation on the beam power of the laser that will triple or quadruple
the current media densities with out getting new media or new drives.
Just so you know that all of these new drive specs that claim to be
coming, I have more than likely seen or was part of, this one did not
evern register as a point of interest.
I call this stuff the ONION CD, becasue the energy require to burn a 10
layer media, regardless that you use a dye laser, will rip appart.
As long as they stay in the WORM mode it may be safe, but if they attemp
CDRW then it will die.
