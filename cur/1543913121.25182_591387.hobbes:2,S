Subject: ICH Intel PATA short cable override...

We see that in ata_piix.c, there is a whitelist for (laptop) Intel ICH
controllers with short cables, tied to specific vendor subsystem IDs.
Since my mini-ITX Ibase MI910F has the subsystem IDs specified as
Intel [1], this is unusable.
I can't find another existing mechanism to add short cable
information, to allow UDMA/66 for my on-board CF socket.
Do you suggest I cook a patch to pass a kernel argument eg 'ich=short'
or 'pata=short', or can you think of a better mechanism?
Thanks,
  Daniel
