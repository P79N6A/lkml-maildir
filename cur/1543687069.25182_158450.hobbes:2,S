	It depends what you mean by "illegal".
	Dereferencing a NULL pointer deliberately to induce the kernel to kill your
process is indistinguishable from dereferencing a NULL pointer accidentally
and forcing the kernel to kill your process.
	These "illegal" operations have well-defined semantics that programmers can
use and rely on. Logging every such operation changes their semantics and
breaks programs that currently work -- breaks in the sense that they will
now DoS logs and result in admin complaints.
	The kernel cannot determine whether a SEGV or ILL was the result of a
deliberate attempt on the part of the programmer to create such a signal or
whether it's due to a programming error. Even an uncaught exception can be
used as a good way to terminate a process immediately (is there another
portable way to do that?).
