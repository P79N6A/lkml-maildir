It looks clean and sane to me, but I'm currently more worried about 
2.6.24, and even the first patch this depends on (coredump/stop race) 
makes me a bit nervous since all these things tend to have some rather 
subtle interactions with other parts that depended on the exact semantics 
of all the signal issues.
So my gut feel - considering that none of the problems involved here are 
exactly new - is that this is good material for early in the 2.6.25 cycle.
But I think the whole series looks ok, and if people press me and convince 
me it's (a) well tested and (b) needed early, then I guess it can be 
pushed into 2.6.24.
Anybody?
