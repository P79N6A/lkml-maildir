If I understood you right, this is PCI, USB or other kind of devices
where module is selected according to PCI/USB/whatever IDs.
You thinking is - if module foo2000 is loaded, this is definitely a
2000 device and you can "check the validity of the passed in values"
for the device 2000 now.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
But you can do absolutely the same at runtime in unified driver,
since PCI/USB/whatever IDs are accessible to the driver.
Two drivers will most likely have code duplication.
Unified driver will be harder to read and maintain because of all
ifs/switch's/function pointers you need.
The choice depends on *how much* maintainability pain you can
tolerate by taking "unified code" path.

Can you give a bit more info what the dirrefences between devices are
in this particular cases?
