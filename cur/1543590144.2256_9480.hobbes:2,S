The patch does indeed seem to prevent the panic, but not the underlying
problem.  Here's the results of a series of mount/umount operations after
applying the patch:
	*** CD inserted
VFS: Disk change detected on device sr(11,0)
	*** first mount (succeeded)
ISO 9660 Extensions: RRIP_1991A
	*** second mount (succeeded)
ISO 9660 Extensions: RRIP_1991A
	*** third mount (succeeded)
ISO 9660 Extensions: RRIP_1991A
	*** fourth and subsequent mounts failed
sr: ran out of mem for scatter pad
 I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 252
isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=0b:00, iso_blknum=63, block=126
sr: ran out of mem for scatter pad
 I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 0
sr: ran out of mem for scatter pad
 I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 64
sr: ran out of mem for scatter pad
 I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 0
	*** the last manual mount attempt
sr: ran out of mem for scatter pad
 I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 64
	*** at this point I logged out, then logged back in as a different
	    user
