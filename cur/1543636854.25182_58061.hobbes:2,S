*nods* Actually the kernel and user packages are in different projects
(zaptel is the kernel level interface, with only a couple of user tools
for its configuration, while zapata is the library interface).  Perhaps
some people might want to contact me off-list to suggest cleaner ways of
organizing the code.

Hard realtime would presumably make sense here, but again the beauty of it
is that the current system works reasonably well without it.  With 1khz
interrupts, I've been unable to generate misses (except with DMA turned
off on IDE) on most modern systems.  In telephony systems, a miss every
now would not be noticed, but in data systems it could represent a dropped
frame.

If someone involved with, or familiar with, this project would care to
contact me, I'd be happy to talk about RT enabling zaptel / asterisk.

Just look at the code and you'll see.

8khz of course like all conventional telephony.  Right now we run at 1khz
for a number of reasons (less stringent requirement, better CPU
utilization, and ability to use USB telephony interfaces easily), but
there are good reasons to push it up to 8khz in some situations.
