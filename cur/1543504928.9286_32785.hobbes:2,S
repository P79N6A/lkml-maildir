If you cannot guarantee stability of writes, then surely atomicity
cannot be guaranteed either. What if the server crashes after sending
the NFS_OK, but before the data is committed?

As long as the operation read+write is not atomic, can you really
implement such a scheme? 
As Alan pointed out, link() and mkdir() are more useful for this sort
of thing.

Only if you specify stable writes (FILE_SYNC) in which case the NFSv2
rules are supposed to apply.
