Hello Marc,
I would try ndiswrapper (
http://ndiswrapper.sf.net
), because it is the
easiest way to run a USB Wireless LAN adapter. The ndiswrapper is a nice
driver, which allows to run Windows NDIS Driver under Linux. Therefore,
you can use the delivered Windows Driver to run your adapter under
Linux. I use for all my wireless adapter this kind of solution. But
maybe it exists a better way to run your adapter under Linux (separate
linux driver or so).
If you need help to install ndiswrapper you should take a look on the
project website.
Regards,
Jens
