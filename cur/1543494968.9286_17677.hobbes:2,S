   why would one OS be better than any other in something like this? I
   don't see any reason linux couldnt do something like this.
   (please erase my ignorance)
When people compare systems, they are usually speaking from the
standpoint of "what can the thing do _now_" not "what could it be made
to do".
Linux can be made to do a lot of things, but it doesn't do them now.
What a system can do now is what will drive most people to decide to
use it at the moment.
