jfs == Journalling File System
The journalling layer for ext3 is not a filesystem by itself.
It is generic journalling code. So, even if IBM did not have
any jfs code, the name would be wrong.
IBM ought to change their name too, because the code they ported
can not mount AIX's current filesystems. An appropriate name
would be jfs2 or os2jfs, to distinguish it from the original.
If the AIX filesystem is ever implemented for Linux, then that
code can get the jfs name.
