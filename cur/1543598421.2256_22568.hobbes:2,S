In the very strict QA'ing sense, yes.  Any sort of change whatsoever is a
different config and throws out all of the other testing results.  Which
still leaves the cost argument in this case.  But, there are degrees of
how dangerous a change can be.  From my quick skimming of this code, it
looks like the only changes are to mark network irq bits as possible entropy.
Nothing more.  I could be totally wrong of course. :)
Therefore, it's quite probable anyhow that this config won't have any more
problems that the other config had.  Of course the only way to prove this
is much QA'ing.
