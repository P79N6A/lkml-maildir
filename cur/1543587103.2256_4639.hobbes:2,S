Duhh. Obviously I should have read the documentation before bashing
my head against the wall. I wasn't running statd. Got it working now,
sorry about that.
I do have a question about lockd. How do I get it back if I need
to restart portmap? Running rpc.lockd doesn't seem to have any
effect whatsoever on the listed rpc services and I can't just
reload the module since nfs depends on it.
