Either.  The specific device we are talking about doesn't care.

mmap /dev/mem.

Minor.  I was just wishing for less magic in this process, which
would make these kinds of devices much more available.

It depends.  If you have a debug cable with magic ends and a hardcoded
address of 127 the normal enumeration doesn't work.  I don't think
anyone actually makes one of those.  Debug devices are also allowed to
be normal devices that just support the debug descriptor.  Which
is what I'm working with.
