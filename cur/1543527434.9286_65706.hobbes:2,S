Do you want to make sure get_block is called, or do you want to make sure
the data in the pages isn't used anymore?  If the data in the page is
still valid, but the block locations on disk have changed, I think you
should be able to use something similar to the unmap_buffer() call in
fs/buffer.c.  
In reiserfs, I'm using this to force a call to get_block for writing to
that offset, but allowing the page cache to keep the data for reads.
