I see SELinux can log with process name, path name and
contexts, but "contexts" must be defined beforehand.
TOMOYO Linux kernel does that with pathname, so no
label definitions needed.
You can confirm the process (domain) transitions any time
and access occurred are clarified per domain basis automatically.
Security context in TOMOYO Linux is represented and stored
as a call chain and very intuitive.
TOMOYO Linux has a mode called "learning"
in addition to "permissive" and "enforce". You can easily
get the TOMOYO Linux policy with learning mode that
SELinux does not have. In addition, access control mode of
TOMOYO Linux can be managed for every difference domain.
