Ahh. Ok. That's my situation. Carry on. Nothing to see here. :)
BTW. Thanks for the port. I can finally backup a windows machine as
rsync+cygwin froze consistantly and 2.4+cifs patch was slow to the point
of uselessness. 2.6.10-ac10 with rsync over cifs gives me a faster speed
then rsync+cygwin ever did, even with a tailwind.
