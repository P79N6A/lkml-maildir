Be sure to create the tar on the same filesystem that you unpack it onto 
--- readdir order affects performance.
A result that we are faster for writes and slower for reads for 
workloads without large directories or small files is believable.
compilation is not an effective benchmark anymore, not for Linux 
filesystems, they are all just too fast (or is it that the compilers are 
too slow?....)
I don't know what ioload does....
