With regards to resource reservation...  IMO we should mimic struct 
pci_dev and add struct resource[] to struct device.
Just like we have pci_request_regions(), we should also be able to 
easily to a dev_request_regions().  the implementation should be very 
close to pci_request_region() and pci_release_region().
Then a dev_iomap() analogue to pci_iomap() should be pretty 
straightforward to create.
