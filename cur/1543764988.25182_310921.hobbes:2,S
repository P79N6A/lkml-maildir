Steve Pratt's ols2004 presentation made AS look pretty bad.  However the
numbers in the proceedings
(
http://www.finux.org/proceedings/LinuxSymposium2004_V2.pdf
) are much less
stark.
Steve, what's up with that?  The slides which you talked to had some awful
numbers.  Was it the same set of tests?
Seems that software RAID might have muddied the waters as well.
That was 2.6.5.  Do you recall if we did significant AS work after that?

My (mpt-fusion-based) workstation is still really slow when there's a lot
of writeout happening.  Just from a quick test:

2.6.11-rc4-mm1, as, mpt-f			39.349 seconds
That was really really slow but had a sudden burst of read I/O at the end
which made the thing look better than it really is.  I wouldn't have a clue
what tag depth it's using, and it's the only mpt-fusion based machine I
have handy...

OK, I'll have a bit more of a poke at the LSI53C1030 driver, see if I can
characterise what's going on.
