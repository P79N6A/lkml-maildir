Correct, the idea is to have four functionalities.
(a) writer preference
	if any writer is waiting then wake that one up.
(b) reader preference
	if any reader is waiting wait up all the readers in the queue
(c) fifo preference
	if the first waiter is a writer wait it up, otherwise wake up all readers
(d) fifo-fair  preference
	like (c), but only wake up readers until the next writer is encountered
(a) - (c) can be implemented with Rusty's 2 user-ueue approach as long
as the wakeup type is always the same. The last one can't (?).
In the kernel this is easy to implement, but the trouble is the status
word in user space, still thinking about it.
It also requires compare and swap.
Also we still need the verdict on the FUTEX_UP and FUTEX_UP_FAIR issue.
Rusty, I noticed you have not stated anything to my combining the two things
into FUTEX V submission. Could you respond with your take on these issues.
