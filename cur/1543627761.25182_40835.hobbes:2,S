Hi there,
I just tested 2.4.19-pre7 and the serial driver (which is built as a
module inserted on demand by devfs) assigns port numbers off by one as
compared to pre6. That is /dev/tts/0 is now /dev/tts/1 and /dev/tts/1 is
now /dev/tts2. This change breaks many configuration scripts, so it should
possibly be fixed until 2.4.19-final. If I can help in that process please
tell me which further tests I should conduct.
Bye
Felix
