I think it is better to avoid such a dependency if possible. It will
especially simplify life of people who use precompiled kernels/modules.
And (IMHO) it is possible and quite easy to remove dependency of drivers
like network drivers on isa-pnp. I will try to prepare a test patch for if
when I find some free time...
But it would be probably a 2.5 feature (with possible backport later).
