|  makes me frown. I'm wondering that not any more people got this error
|  message.
I haven't taken the time to compile the same kernel on a slackware machine
yet nor have I bothered with attempting to see if I could produce the same
problem on my other redhat box..  What distro of linux are you using?
Makes me wonder if my choice to move to redhat was maybe premature..
Has anyone else ran into this compile time error or know how to fix it?
Seems that more than just two people would have to be experiancing this
problem..
