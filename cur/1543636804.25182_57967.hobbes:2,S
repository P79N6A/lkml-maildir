Subject: [PATCH 1/2][CFT] Full rmap VM for 2.5.27
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

A new release of the full-featured rmap patch (Rik van Riel's rmap-13b) is 
available against the minimal rmap in 2.5.27.  This first patch brings the 
2.5 VM into approximate parity with 2.4-ac in terms of basic page 
replacement, page aging, and lru list logic.

Changelog:
- Sync'ed with the 2.5.27 rmap merge
- Added Bill Irwin's recent patch that converts the pte_chain freelist to 
  use mempool.  Updated VM stats.  A nice patch that seems to work well 
  here, so far... :)
Next release:
- multi-page batch processing of the list-scanning methods in 
  vmscan to reduce lock contention, ala Andrew Morton's recent patches
- looking into 2.4-aa for useful tidbits
- various rmap updates from the usual suspects... :)
