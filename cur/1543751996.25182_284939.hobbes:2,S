There seems to be some confusion in certain quarters as to the proper 
procedure for reporting possible kernel security issues.   
REPORTING-BUGS says send bug reports to the maintainer of that area of 
the kernel.  However, what about areas for which a maintainer is not 
listed?  (e.g. VM)  It seems that some take that to mean send it 
directly to Linus and if you don't hear something back quickly, release 
an exploit to the wild.
So what is the preferred procedure and is it documented somewhere?  
Should it be made more prominent?
Thanks for any information,
Steve Bergman
