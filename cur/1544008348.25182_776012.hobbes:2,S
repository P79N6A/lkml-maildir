Looking at the existing code, it's not actually broken - but only by accident.
We aim to add a link for each cgroup, which we do by finding the first
subsystem in each hierarchy and adding a link for its cgroup, and then
adding a link for dummytop if there weren't any subsystems in the
inactive hierarchy.
But since rootnode.subsys_list is always empty, we always skip the
inactive hierarchy in the main loop (if it has any subsystems), and
always add the inactive hierarchy afterwards. So everything works out
OK (all hierarchies do get linked), but it's horribly unreadable.
Having the subsys_list be correct for the inactive hierarchy is
probably a good thing, so this patch should go ahead (once the typos
is fixed).
