Wow, freeing lots of PageReserved() pages.  I assume via free_initmem(),
but it's strange that free_initmem() makes no appearance in the backtrace.
I don't know which change could have caused this.  Nobody else has reported
this, but 32-on-64 might be pretty rare.  If you can send the config I'll
see if it happens here?
