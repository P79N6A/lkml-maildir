I'll summarize some of the answers:

It isn't necessarily an entitled user; see below. But even if it 
is, I think it should be able to limit it, just as it is 
possible to put a limit on processes.

That is provided that he is able to root the system. Take for 
example Apache, a program that is relatively often cracked. It, 
as many other programs, doesn't run as root. If the attacker 
could tie up all PTYs, though, he could go on his business 
(extracting confidential information, subnet scanning, etc.) 
without root being able to log in to stop him. Instead, the 
admimistrator might have to call the datacenter to get them to 
reboot the box.
Of course, if the attacker is able to root the box, it doesn't 
help very with a resource limit, but that's more of an issue for 
the grsecurity project, isn't it?

That is true, though, of course. Stupid me not to think about 
that. However, that means that an administrator who could find 
himself being under such an attack might not think about it 
either. Also, from the outside, the ssh client just does 
nothing, making it look as if the server is unresponsive. Of 
course, the exact error is logged to the server's syslog, but if 
you can't view it, then you won't know about it.
So all in all, do you think I should implement a per-user 
resource limit on PTYs?
