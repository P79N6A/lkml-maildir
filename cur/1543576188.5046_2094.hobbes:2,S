Hmmm... Even if LMB and I are often of quite different oppinions, I
think only modifying klogd is not enough. LMB stated that a userspace
tool would need to know any possibly error messages that could
possibly generated. Cleaning up all messages would be the first
step to prepare for failure reports to userspace. Ie, what errors do
re have?
	- Sense errors (recoverable)            \
	-    "    "    (unrecoverable)           > for all kinds of devices
	- Complete device failure (HDD is gone) /
	- Data failure (wrong ext2 bitmaps) for all FS
	- RAM's ECC/parity errors
	- possibly some more;)
Cleaning up all error messages (maybe using exctly two lines: one for kind
of failure, one for device/RAM/fs specific messages) could help a lot
and doesn't hurt badly (code doesn't get really slower as these paths
are more-or-less never taken; but there is a little bit more bloat...).
With such an infrastructure, klogd could pass those lines to an external
helper (and additionally to syslog).
