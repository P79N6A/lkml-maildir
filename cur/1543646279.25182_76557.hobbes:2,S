Subject: /proc/net/bootpc support for non-ASCII vendor specific tags?

Currently it appears that /proc/net/bootpc assumes that all reserved 
vendor specific tags contain ASCII information.  Is this part of the 
BOOTP standard?  I hadn't thought so, but maybe I'm missing something.
Assuming that binary information is allowable, would a patch printing 
out tags 128-254 of the vendor specific information as raw hex 
characters be considered acceptable/useful?
I need this for my own purposes, and I'm just wondering if I should 
bother trying to push it up.
