Why don't *you* nuke everything else from /proc and move it to /dev/ -
while you are busy doing that I will get a chance to move
/proc/driver/microcode -> /dev/cpu/microcode myself and send a patch to
Linus. Ok, I discovered (well, Richard told me) the devfs=nomount option
so I will do the move today. So, perhaps Linus should ignore my v1.02
patch as a few things will change.
Thanks,
