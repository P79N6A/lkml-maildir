Well, what you want to do is prioritise interactive tasks over cpu hogs.
What *seems* to be happening is you're just switching between cpu hogs
more ... that doesn't help anyone really. I don't have an easy answer
for how to fix that, but it doesn't seem desireable to me - we need some
better way of working out what's interactive, and what's not.
