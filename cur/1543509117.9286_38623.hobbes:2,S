Well, we should probably also check the device... And a lot of code
checks also for the directory inode in case of a file (any clue why we
need to check dev/ino/dirino ? I thought that dev/ino ought to be
sufficient...)
Mmmh, I think there's something more subtle going on.
The problem lasts a few seconds where all fh lookups fail, and after
that everything is back to normal... If the original dentry were
flushed out, the problem would persist.
Plus, I think the export structure keeps the dentry locked.
But, I'm not a dcache guru anyways...
Phil.
