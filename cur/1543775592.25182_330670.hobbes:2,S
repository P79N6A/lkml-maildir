    Karim, three comments:
- CPU ID needs be bigger than 8-bits, else you can only support up to 256p
- Are 8-bit event IDs big enough?  A comment explainig that sub-IDs should
  be placed within the log record would help avoid the issue of the 8-bit
  space disappearing too quickly
- To avoid the problem of RelayFS non-reenterancy I think ltt_log_event() will
  need a hook at its end so that whatever mechanism was used to avoid the
  situation can be disabled.
