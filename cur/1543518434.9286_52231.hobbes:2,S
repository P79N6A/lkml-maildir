    If the published interface is stable enough so that you can take a
    driver and compile it on any old Linux (which is NOT currently the
    case), the published interface is stable enough so you can publish
    binaries that will work against any old Linux.    If the idea of not
    having a published interface is so that the Core Team can obfuscate
    the kernel faster than hardware vendors can change their drivers to
    keep up, this scheme would go directly against the aims of the
    kernel.
