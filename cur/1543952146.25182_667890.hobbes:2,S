Its not a huge deal, but we've seen globally scoped timekeeping
variables misused either accidentally or intentionally. Awhile back ppc
was corrupting time_offset by using it for a timezone offset value. 
So I think its a valid maintainability issue.

I agree its a trade off. But do you have performance numbers to make the
maintainability trade off worth it? (I admit, it is used in the
timer_interrupt, so it may very well be worth it, but we might want to
check first).
