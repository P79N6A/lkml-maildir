I think mine might be different. I've got a vga parameter (vga=0x301), and 
mine disappears very early, before when you usually get "Console: 
colour VGA+ 80x25" (and I'm getting "Console: coloud dummy 80x25" 
instead). I've also got CONFIG_FB turned off entirely.
But if you've got any insight into how the console driver stuff works from 
troubleshooting your problem, I could use the hints...
