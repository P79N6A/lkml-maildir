Subject: [PATCH 19/47] PM: update docs for writing .../power/state
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/26/44

From: David Brownell <david-b@pacbell.net>
Updates to match current code:
 - Make writes to the /sys/devices/.../power/state files fail cleanly
   if the device requires the irqs-off call variants.
 - Fix comments describing the /sys/devices/.../power/state file writes
   to match the code; the last several releases have invalidated the
   previous text.
