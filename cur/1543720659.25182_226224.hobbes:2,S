Hi,
I am building a custom kernel which could break the max file size limit from 2TB. I found the dependancy on number of 512-byte blocks, as i_blocks.
i_blocks is a 32 bit unsigned long in structures struct inode and struct ext3_inode. I changed it to unsigned long long in struct inode (in fs.h) and used a reserved field in ext3_inode to carry the higher order bits.
Also changed a checking function which returns the maximun possible size as 2TB.
My question is:
Would changing the data type of i_blocks in struct inode (in fs.h) result in any breakdowns. It could happen if the inode structure is directly mapped to some other structure.
I tested at my end with a low end PC and it seems to work fine, for the past 6 hours.
Thanks,
