So the score of each registered process, with or without 
token, is calculated periodically. After each calculation,
a registered process with the highest score will take the token.
So a process gives up its token in these 4 cases:
(1) its page fault rate below a threshold (2) its score below
a threshold; (3) it holds a token for too long time (4) it is 
done. 
However, we have to avoid "token thrashing": a token is transfered
among processes too frequently, which could actually create unnecessarily
addtional page faults. So once a process gets the token, we can let
it hold the token for at least a minimal period of time. 
The intention behind the score = time/size is very sound, but
I am not sure how sensitive the performance is to the formula.
We may need to tune it carefully to make it valid.    
Which process will register itself? In my original design,
I allow a process with any major page faults to take the token.
However, I think now we should only allow the processes with their
page fault rate higher than a threshold to register themselves.
In this way we can limit the queue size.

Do we need to periodically compare the scores of registered processes?
If yes, that would take queueing complexity.
