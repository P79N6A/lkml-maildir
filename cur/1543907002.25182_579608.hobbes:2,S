Subject: [PATCH] Fix /proc/pid/pagemap end address calculation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

When dumping vma information the pagemap_read routine calculates
the minimum of what the user asks for and the end of the vma.
Unfortunately the code uses vma->vm_start rather than vma->vm_end
which can result in the end address being before the start, and
a nasty never-ending loop in the kernel.
Diffed against 2.6.23-rc1-mm2
