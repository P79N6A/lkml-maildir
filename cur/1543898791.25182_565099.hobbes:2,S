That's always a hard one to call, and the answer is generally to
follow the existing style, even if it's broken.  At a later date,
a patch which _just_ fixes the style can be submitted.
The point of _just_ fixing the style is that it's trivial to prove
that no other changes have happened - you build the file without
the change and save a copy of the object.  Apply the change and
rebuild, and compare the resulting text/data.  They should be the
same, if not there's a bug somewhere.
(There have been instances where reformatting the code has introduced
subtle unexpected changes, so it's always worth performing that check
just in case.)
