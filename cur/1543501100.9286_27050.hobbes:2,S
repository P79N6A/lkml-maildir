It seems that we are MS is striking hard against Linux and they have a
lot
of money and people to spread FUD, etc. over Linux.
Maybe their best strike so far has been the Mindcraft libel (and
sequels...)
Lies, statistics and benchmarks:
	Why are all these benckmarks essentially flawed compared to other
	kind of benchmarks: because they are specially artificious.
	Benchmarks are normally artificious but regarding FPU, disk IO
	etc, I can say that I, myself, have more than 10 computers 
	doing FULL FPU calculations full time or people using full 
	disk IO for video streaming, etc... but who on earth has a 
	single web server with four fast ethernets serving static web 
	pages at the rate that benchmarks use?
	(

 )
	NOBODY.
Should Linux take MS bait and involve itself into a frentic
benchmarkitis 
forgetting its main strengths: stability, reliability and low end
hardware 
usability?
	NO.
(Unfortunately it seems that this bait is very easy to take for free
software developpers :-/)
On the other side, can we forget medium size hardware (high end servers,
SMP, fast IO disk systems, etc)
	AGAIN, NO.
The point of balance between these two trends is very difficult to find
but I feel that at this moment it is the survival test of Linux vs. MS.begin:vcard
