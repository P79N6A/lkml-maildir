I think it's very consistent -- your patch would make it inconsistent though.

Sorry, but when you ask for NUMA emulation you will get it. I don't see
any point in a "half way only for some subsystems I like" NUMA emulation. 
It's unlikely that your ideas of where it is useful and where is not
matches other NUMA emulation user's ideas too.
Besides adding such a secondary node space would be likely a huge long term 
mainteance issue. I just can it see breaking with every non trivial change.
NACK.
