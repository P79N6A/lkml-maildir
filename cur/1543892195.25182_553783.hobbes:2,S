Oleg and I were just discussing this issue in relation to other problems.
We established that it is never safe to clear TIF_SIGPENDING on another
thread.  But I hadn't really thought through that it's sometimes not safe
to clear your own TIF_SIGPENDING either.  That is, any time you are not
positive you cannot be in a syscall that will return a -ERESTART* code.
(I had the ptrace_stop case lurking in the back of my mind but hadn't
considered how it would really come up.)
I have a general recollection of thinking that dequeue_signal could only
be called on current and that it mattered somehow.  But aside from
avoiding recalc_sigpending, and kernel threads with notifier_mask set, I
can't see off hand what it is.  I won't testify that I think signalfd is
necessarily on safe ground, though.
Thanks,
Roland

[PATCH] Restrict clearing TIF_SIGPENDING
This patch should get a few birds.  It prevents sigaction calls from
clearing TIF_SIGPENDING in other threads, which could leak -ERESTART*.
It fixes ptrace_stop not to clear it, which done at the syscall exit
stop could leak -ERESTART*.  It probably removes the harm from
signalfd, at least assuming it never calls dequeue_signal on kernel
threads that might have used block_all_signals.
