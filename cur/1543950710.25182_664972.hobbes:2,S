Hi,
'watchdog' is of SCHED_FIFO class. The standard load-balancer doesn't
move RT tasks between cpus anymore and there is a special mechanism in
scher_rt.c instead (I think, it's .25 material).
So I wonder, whether __migrate_task() is still capable of properly
moving a RT task to another CPU (e.g. for the case when it's in
TASK_RUNNING state) without breaking something in the rt migration
mechanism (or whatever else) that would leave us with a runqueue in
the 'inconsistent' state...
(I've taken a quick look at the relevant code so can't confirm it yet)
maybe it'd be faster if somebody could do a quick test now with the
following line commented out in kernel/softlockup.c :: watchdog()
-         sched_setscheduler(current, SCHED_FIFO, &param);
