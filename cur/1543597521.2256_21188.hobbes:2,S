Subject: Porting char driving from 2.2 to 2.4 : changes in API to know

All,
I'm porting dataq driver from 2.2 to 2.4 and found a problem with using
interruptible_sleep_on_timeout() and wake_up_interruptible().
Knowing that wait queue was reorganized in 2.4 I declared queue head as:
static DECLARE_WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD(wqhead);
and then in ioctl routine
..
// put request on hold
interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&wqhead, jiffies);
...
and
..
// release process
wake_up_interruptible(&wqhead);
interruptible_sleep_on_timeout() works correctly and releases process when timeout
expires. However wake_up_interruptible() doesn't work.
Questions:
1. Is "interruptible" functions still recommended for use under 2.4?
2. What other changes made can potentially affect this mechanism?
3. Should I use some special options/flags to compile modules under 2.4
(beyond discussed in lkml FAQ)?
