ah, but before I even installed windows, it told me there was no operating 
system installed - I could only boot up with a LILO disk even then - and as 
for the windows partition being bootable... it isn't!  hda1 is the only active 
partition, and that's my Linux partition! (I originally had LILO installed on 
the Superblock of hda1, rather than the MBR, but when I kept getting no 
operating system messages, I switched it)
Thanks,
