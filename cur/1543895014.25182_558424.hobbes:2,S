I am dealing with bug tracking in the kernel Bugzilla.
I did regression tracking for the kernel.
Michal is currently tracking regressions.
Andrew is doing an enormous amount of work in these areas.
You might not see it because you are not active in this area, but it is 
working in an organized way.
What is not working is getting all tracked bugs properly debugged.

Bugzilla is a usable tool for bug and regression reporting and tracking 
tracking.
I am using the Debian BTS since 8 years and I've used many Bugzillas.
Both are usable, and the real problem in kernel development is not 
really related to the question which tool to use for bug tracking.

unmaintained != unused
user != developer
worked != went pretty fine
Stuff can easily get broken and noone looks after bugs if there's no 
maintainer both knowing the code and willing to debug bugs.
The floppy driver is actually an example of code that has been broken 
quite often by patches simply because noone who completely understands 
this driver reviewed patches.
It somehow works and it might work for some years, but there is a 
problem.

IMHO your point of view is simply not related to the real current 
quality problems in kernel development.
