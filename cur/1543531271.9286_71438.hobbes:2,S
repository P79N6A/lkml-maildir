Of course, what you perhaps need is some sort of filename equivalent of fcntl
(like fchmod/chmod are file-descriptor/filename equivalents).
For example:
	ffcntl(const char *filename, int op, ...);
I wouldn't have thought you'd want to open a file (particularly a device file)
just to tweak some filesystem parameters on it.
