Of course you are right.  But I guess you don't need a journalling FS on
such machines, because the hard disks will be small, too, so fsck time
isn't such a big issue.
Of course, if ext2fs is dropped from the standard kernel distribution in
favour of XFS, there might be some problem on lowest-end machines---but,
given the installation base of ext2fs, I don't think that will ever
happen.
