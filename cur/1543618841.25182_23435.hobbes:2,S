That fix only becomes active when the pixelclock is over half the maximum
value for the DAC on your card.

That means it would be difficult to hit with the console at 80x32 and X at
640x480, unless you run at a ridiculous vertical frequency.

with a version from before 2.4.18-pre6.
Since I proposed this fix, I'd be intertested to know if this fix caused it.
Let me know,
