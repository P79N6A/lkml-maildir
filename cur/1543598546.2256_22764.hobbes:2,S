The kernel has nothing to do with reinitializing the mouse: X has to do
that.  I was looking into this a few months ago when the installer's mouse
probe code stopped working on 2.4, and it became apparent that there is
lots of userland code that doesn't do the right thing to handle mouse hot
plug reinitialization.  gpm and X both need bugfixing in this area.  As
for the kernel, it needs a few improvements during 2.5: I plan to submit a
patch that replaces much of the existing pc keyboard/mouse code with state
machine driven code that doesn't block interrupts out for long periods of
time, as well as fixing a few of the lockup issues the current driver has.
