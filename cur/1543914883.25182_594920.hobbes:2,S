I suppose so.  Does anyone actually use mandatory locking?
Would it be worth adding a
	if (MANDATORY_LOCK(inode))
		return;
to the beginning of locks_wakeup_mandatory() to avoid walking the list
of locks in that case?  Perhaps setattr is rare enough that this just
isn't worth caring about.
Is there a small chance that a lock may be applied after this check:
> +	mandatory = (inode->i_flock && MANDATORY_LOCK(inode));

but early enough that someone can still block on the lock while the file
is still marked for mandatory locking?  (And is the inode->i_flock check
there really necessary?)
Well, there are probably worse races in the mandatory locking code.
(For example, my impression is that a mandatory lock can be applied just
after the locks_mandatory_area() checks but before the io actually
completes.)
