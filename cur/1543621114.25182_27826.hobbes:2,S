I run mixed ext3 and xfs systems from the current xfs cvs tree.
We also have 2.4.18-pre9 (not ac1) running internally. As for
the superblock issue, you should check if they are allowing mount
to auto determine the filesystem type or not, this would maybe
point to stale data in the block device interface.
Just a guess.
