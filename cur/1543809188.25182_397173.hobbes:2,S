This is expected behavior.  The kernel doesn't have a /dev at the time 
it mounts the root fs so it has no idea what /dev/sda1 is.  Typically 
lilo will translate /dev/sda1 to 0x0801 automatically for you and pass 
that to the kernel for this reason. 
These days most distributions are using an initrd which the kernel 
mounts as the root fs, and that sets up a minimal /dev and does some 
hardware detection.  In that scenario, you can use free form /dev 
strings, assuming that they actually exist by the time the initrd's 
startup scripts finish running.
