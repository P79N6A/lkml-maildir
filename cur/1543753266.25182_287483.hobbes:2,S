I need a way to reproduce it. Preferably on a hardware configuration
that is running 2.6.10-ac10 or later because of the bio and acpi fixes.
I'm not interested in any report including binary drivers and to be
honest the least complex configuration the better. I also care that the
hardware passes memtest86+ !
I also don't care about XFS although Christoph may well do.
