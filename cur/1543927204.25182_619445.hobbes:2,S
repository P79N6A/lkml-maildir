Hm, you need to call device_power_down(PMSG_SUSPEND) before
hibernation_ops->enter().
Also, all of the ACPI global calls need to be carried out before that and the
devices should be suspended rather than shut down in that case.
That's why hibernation_platform_enter() has been introduced, BTW.

I see, but I'm not sure it's correct.

Please leave the freezer alone for now.  We'll clean up all that when we decide
to remove it.

Yes, please use as much of the existing code as reasonably possible, so that we
don't need to duplicate changes in the future.

Thanks.
There will be some more cosmetic changes in this area, probably before 2.6.25,
so please stay tuned.
