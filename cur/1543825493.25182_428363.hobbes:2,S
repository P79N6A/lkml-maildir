Hi,
I am trying to declare dmi_ids in drivers/input/misc/wistron_btns.c as
__initdata but gcc keeps bitching about
"drivers/input/misc/wistron_btns.c:326: error: dmi_ids causes a
section type conflict" unless I also declare that variable as "const".
I checked GCC's assembler output and using "static const struct
dmi_system_id __initdata dmi_ids[] = {..." does indeed get it into
".init.data" section but comments in include/linux/init.h specifically
mention that the data can't be const... This is with GCC 3.4.4.
Anyone have any ideas, pretty please?
