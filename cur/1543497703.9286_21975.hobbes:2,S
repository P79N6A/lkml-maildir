I get this on all kernels (back into the 2.1... series) in this
configuration: ISDN, HiSax, sync PPP, ix86, egcs-1.1.2,
binutils-2.9.1.0.25 (and many, many previous versions)
What happens is that, after a few hours or days of uptime, outgoing
connections with large amounts of data stall, though other
connections continue OK. Unloading the ISDN and PPP modules, then
reloading them, fixes the problem until the next time it dies.
Haven't seen how long 2.3.4 can last yet.
