No, it was certainly not intentional, and I can't figure out why it happens.
The ioctl numbers from your example are HDIO_DRIVE_CMD and CDROM_GET_CAPABILITY,
both of which should be handled through compat_blkdev_driver_ioctl by calling
the native ioctl method of the driver, and return -ENOTTY otherwise.
The one point where it is expected to have changed now is when you try
to do these ioctls on something that is not a block device. Are you sure that
the files you tried them on were created correctly?
