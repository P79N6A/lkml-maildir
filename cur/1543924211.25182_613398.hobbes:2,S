The Subject is still missleading, I'm using 2.6.23-mm1.

The behavior was different on these stalls.
On first report the writeout stopped completly, the emerge stopped,
but at that time a cat /proc/meminfo >~/stall/meminfo did succedd and
not stall.
About the watch cat /proc/meminfo, I will write in the answer to the
other mail...

No. I wanted to see what is stalled. So I startet by collecting info
from /proc and then the SysRq+W. And after hitting SysRQ the writeout
started to resume without any further action.
But I think I have seen a `sync` stall also. During an other emerge I
noticed the system slowing down and wanted to use `sync` to speed up
the writeout. The result was, that the writeout did not speed up
imiedetly only after around a minitue. The `sync` only returned at
that time.
Can writers starve `sync`?

I don't know. It's just that I have seen tmpfs also redirtieing inodes
in these logs and the stalling emerge is moving files from tmpfs to
xfs.
It could be, but I don't know enough about tmpfs internals to really be sure.
I just wanted to mention, that tmpfs is involved somehow.
