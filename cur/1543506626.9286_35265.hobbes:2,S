These are two different bugs.
The reason you go OOM is a memory leak in the time-wait TCP code fixed in
the pre-2.2.12. 2.2.12-final3 is the latest release (search in Alan's
kernel directory).
The segfault from init (and other possible OOM deadlocks) are other MM
bugs and I fixed all them some time ago. You need my patch on the top of
2.2.12-final3 if you want to be safe w.r.t. OOM handling in 2.2.x:
