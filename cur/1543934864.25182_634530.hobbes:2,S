Do you think they did refer to code style (as in indentation etc.) here? 
When I was talking to such people my impression was that their complaints
usually came from other issues.
e.g. I know from talking to a few people that they consider the BSD
kernels cleaner just because they have a very consistent printk
style for driver probing so it looks cleaner at booting. Sounds silly
(although I can sympathize a little bit) but true.
Besides the kernel indentation is not that inconsistent anyways.

That's the problem I have with your position. You equate quality
with coding style or checkpatch.pl output. I think it's only a small
part of it.
If we follow your description above to the logical conclusion then we could 
get the perfect kernel(tm) very quickly just by running everything 
through Lindent or recruit a few hundred people who run all files 
through checkpatch.pl and fix all warnings and then we end up with the 
perfect kernel with "improved code quality" 
Great idea! And is it ok for me to refer to that plan as "the Ingo Molnar
plan" (TIMP) in the future? I'm sure a short term for it will come handy 
in future discussions ;-)
