both those apps are buggy and incorrect though and should be fixed.

I consider that unlikely. Anything remotely portable (either to other
architectures which required since in linux since day one, or to OpenBSD
or similar which require this even for x86) already is correct. And this
is there since 2.6.6.. it's not like this is new
(and for the non-RWE case, fedora has had this behavior all along with
execshield, and that even lead to a patch to fix mono fwiw)
