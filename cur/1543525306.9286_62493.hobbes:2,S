Bounded by the size of a 100Gb disk array means bounded by several
hours.  I don't want to have to wait several hours for ps to read
in /etc/passwd so I can kill whatever process went nuts.

It happens on reiserfs.  Try it.
And if my disk bus/disk/driver can write X Mb per second, and I have a
single process which wants to write X Mb per second then, filesystem
permitting, I don't want my task to get stuck writing (X/2) Mb / sec,
just because some silly heuristic said that it didn't deserve it.

My example was very simplistic.  Think how "cp /dev/zero ." works:
Read block from /dev/zero
Write block to ./zero
Repeat
Unless you have very slow CPUs, you will fill up RAM with dirty pages/
buffers eventually.  That will cause the write to stall while the kernel
pushes out dirty pages to disk.  Once the first lot of IOs have completed
and a few others have been scheduled, the cp wakes up, finishes its write
and gets on with filling your disk.
Now, depending upon your filesystems alloction strategies, it's entirely
possible completely to starve a process waiting for a teeny-tiny IO at
the other end of the disk (or at the same end, but you're moving away
from it).
Really, it happens.  You don't see it so mcuh with SCSI, but it happens
a lot with IDE.
Matthew.
