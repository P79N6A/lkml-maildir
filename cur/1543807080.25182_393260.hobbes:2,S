I cannot speak from own experiences on Linux here, but this is what I see:
-	If you check Linux distributions for related bug reports,
	you find many problems with hald.
-	If you try to find similar bug reports for Solaris vold, there is
	no report I am aware of.
Trying to rate this would make me asume that hald could be changed to play
better with cdrecord.
