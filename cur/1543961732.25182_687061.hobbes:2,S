i think the established rule is that there's one Author field per 
commit. Multiple authors should either submit a tree with multiple 
commits (which shows the exact lineage of work) - or, for nontrivial 
joint work where the development tree would be way too messy, expose 
proper credits in copyrights/credit info in the source code. It's seldom 
that work is split exactly in half - better spell out who did what both 
in the source code and in the commit log - without trying to formalize 
the From/Author line. [which line will always be imprecise for multiple 
authors.]
