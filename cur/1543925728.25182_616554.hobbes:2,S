Although the first run is always slowest, but if we compare 2.6.23 and 2.6.24-rc,
we could find the first run result of 2.6.23 is 7 times of the one of 2.6.24-rc.
Originally, my test suite is just to pick up the result of first run. I might
change my test suite to make it run for many times.
Now I run the the test manually for many times after machine reboots. Comparing 2.6.24-rc
with 2.6.23, 3rd and following run of 2.6.24-rc has about 50% regression.
