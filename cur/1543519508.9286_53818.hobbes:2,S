All PPC snoop (the data and L2 cache) provided the host bridge flags the
accesses it performs on behalf of PCI devices as global (with the GBL bus
signal). Setting or not this signal is an option on some bridges but you
can safely assume that it will be set since it makes things much simpler
(otherwise you'd have to explicitly flush the caches).

Sorry I was not clear:
on PPC an MMIO read can go ahead of an MMIO write unless an eieio or sync
instruction is in between (or the read is from the same address as the
write). Writes can be reordered / gathered in host bridge too (or in the
processor for non guarded storage) unless there is an explicit ordering
barrier. This cause all {read,write,in,out}[bwl] on PPC to be followed by
an eieio instruction. 
If I understand correctly all the issues (a big if), you have to put a
strong memory barrier to have guaranteed behaviour in your case.  By
strong I mean a PPC 'sync' instruction, 'eieio' is not enough since it
does not order writeback memory accesses relative to noncacheable memory
accesses. 
AFAIK, all _current_ PPC processors execute stores in order, and store
buffers will not be a problem since they are inside the coherent memory
domain (this is clearly stated on the 604 documentation, unfortunately the
available 7400/G4 documentation is still very poor). This means that
stores to memory will enter the coherent memory domain before a write to a
device register takes place. But this is not required and therefore not
safe...
I still don't see why they would want to execute the write to the device
register before the earlier stores enters the coherent memory domain. The
implementation complexity is probably not worth the performance gain.

Indeed, but in my case (generating VMEbus locked cycle through Tundra's
Universe chip) the things are clear: 
1) acquire a spinlock for SMP
2) write 5 registers which describe the locked cycle
3) ordering barrier
4) read from a register to actually perform the locked cycle
5) ordering barrier
6) write to disable the locked cycle generator
7) release the spinlock
the order in which registers are accessed in step 2 is totally irrelevant
and actually 5) is a nop since I don't know of any processor which would
reorder a write before a read. If you count the bus cycles with an eieio
after each read/write versus the minimum actually implemented, 14 versus
9, it becomes significant.

Ok, I've put them on 
ftp://vlab1.iram.es/pub/ppcdocs
 since it's too big
for email (even private, I never considered posting it to the list).
