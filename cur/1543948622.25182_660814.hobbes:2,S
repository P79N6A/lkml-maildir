I remember raising this before, but I think we need to try and find a 
better way to implement this than always allocating labels of a fixed and 
possibly too-small size.
What about perhaps starting with a statically allocated array of say 64 
bytes (I can't see any labels on my system larger than that), and then 
falling back to a a dynamic allocation of up to 32k if it turns out to be 
too small ?  i.e. large labels are a slow path and there is no practical 
limit on label size.
