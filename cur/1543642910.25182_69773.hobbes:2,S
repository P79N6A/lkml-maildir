Which still leaves the question, does it really make sense for
FATAL/BUG to forcibly kill the machine? If the bug is truly fatal,
presumably the machine kills itself in short order anyway, otherwise
we might have a shot at recording the situation. A more useful
distinction might be in terms of risk of damaging filesystems (or perhaps
hardware) if we continue, something like BROKEN/DANGEROUSLY_BROKEN.
