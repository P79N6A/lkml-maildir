stale file handles is a known bug that is fixed in the but BK and will
be in 2.6.3.
The "RPC request reserved 0 ..." is very odd. It does immediately
indicate a major problem, but it should be fixed, if only I could
figure out what was causing it.
I might put come more info into the message so future bug reports will
tell me more.
Thanks,
