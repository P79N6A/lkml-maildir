So the points you added to your todo list which were brought up by me
are worthless ?
I'm not handwaving. I started this RFC to move the discussion into a
general discussion about instrumentation. A couple of people are
seriosly interested to do this. If you are not interested then ignore
the thread, but you're way not in a position to tell me to shut up.
You turned this thread into your LTT prayer wheel.
Roman pointed out your unwillingness to create a common framework
before. But I have to disagree with him in one point. It's not amazing,
it's annoying.

I pointed you to actually broken code and you accused me of throwing
mud.

Yes, I did already start cleaning
