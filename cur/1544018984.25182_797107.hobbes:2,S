Is this the SD Association standard host controller interface, or a
custom one by Freescale?  If the former, then I'd suggest:
	This selects OF support for the SD Association standard Secure
	Digital Host Controller Interface (version x.xx).  So far,
	only the Freescale eSDHC controller is the only example on OF
	platforms.
if the latter:
	This selects OF support for Freescale's custom Secure Digital
	Host Controller Interface.  So far, only the Freescale eSDHC
	controller is the only example on OF platforms.
