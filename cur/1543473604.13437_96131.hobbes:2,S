There are lots of reasons right now for not switching straight to ALSA. One
of which is that 2.2 is weeks away. The switching away from OSS is already in
hand.

The current kernel OSS is no longer maintained by Hannu, and despite your
comments I still have a lot of respect for the free software Hannu produced
and the contribution he continued to make to the free one. I don't think you
can criticize Hannu and applaud ghostscript at the same time.

That is definitely true. Since I took over the OSS-free code and the soundcore
(the module that allows you to mix OSS-free, non OSS and ALSA (in theory anyway)
modules people have written ES1370/ES1371/SonicVibes/Wavefront/TB/ES18xx drivers
and there are people working on more free drivers.
