We know very well and Ingo nowhere said, that this is not a perfect
queue, but it was and still is _our_ work base and we opened it up for
the reasons explained.
What we definitely not need is platitude advise, how we should manage
the queue and what could be improved as well as hysteric shuffling in
the queue right now.
There are enough problems to work on, cleanups to do and the least one
is to worry about how the queue is organized.
