Let's look at the problem this thread is about:
menuconfig NEW_LEDS
        bool "LED Support"
config LEDS_CLASS
        tristate "LED Class Support"
	depends on NEW_LEDS              # actually an "if", but that's 
                                           just syntactical sugar
config X86_RDC321X
        bool "RDC R-321x SoC"
        select LEDS_CLASS
If you select LEDS_CLASS "select follows dependencies" would let inherit 
X86_RDC321X the dependencies of LEDS_CLASS, IOW treat it as:
config X86_RDC321X
        bool "RDC R-321x SoC"
        select LEDS_CLASS
	depends on NEW_LEDS
That might make the randconfig crowd happy.
But from an UI perspective it's not an improvement.
And regarding "displaying all relevant dependency chains" to the user - 
I can't see how that would work in the more complicated cases.
