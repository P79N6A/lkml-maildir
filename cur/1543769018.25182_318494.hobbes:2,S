I have to do a bit of traveling, and one time I didn't want to bring my
main laptop, and instead brought along my 75MHz IBM Thinkpad 755CX. (a
professor laughed at me and jokingly offered me his palm pilot as an
upgrade!).  I actually used this to do kernel compiles. So this can take
quite some time on this type of hardware.

With this simple script, you only need to use what the distribution
installed (hopefully it also installs the .config that is used). And the
script will remove all the modules but the ones that are loaded.
