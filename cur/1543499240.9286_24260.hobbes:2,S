Subject: 2.2.10 PATCH so that tunelp can compile again

2.2.10 and 2.3.6 have a change to include/linux/lp.h that was apparently
intended to fix a problem where some kernel routines were being
exported even when __KERNEL__ was not defined.  However, it also
accidentally disabled about half of the hardware related declarations,
causing tunelp to fail to compile.  Here is the patch.
