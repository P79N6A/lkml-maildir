Hi Balaji,
Nice driver.  I particularly like the queueing structure. In the IIO
design I hadn't come across any devices that operate in this request
then wait for interrupt fashion.  May need to rethink a few bits of
that.
Couple of minor suggestions below.

This is confusingly named. To my mind it is writing the setup
to the device not reading it.

This needs a bit more explanation. Particularly as the data
sheet describes that accsw as 'for rationmetric measurement'.
Also, seeing as I assume this is the only driver that can touch
these registers and you don't change them else where, why can't
they be in initial setup code rather than here? (probably a good
reason, but be nice to have it document here!)

Weird formatting?

Rest looks good to me.
