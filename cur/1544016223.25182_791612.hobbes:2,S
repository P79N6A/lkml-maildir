There is also the additional issue that continuing to boot might hide
the original error message. Indeed, the kernel might panic eventually
(as you said, for example due to missing init), but in the meantime the
original "junk in compressed archive" might have scrolled off the
screen. And after a panic, shift+pageup does not work to inspect past
messages.
