Hello.
We have a webserver running the Slackware distribution of Linux, with
Kernel version 2.2.6. Our problem is that this machine looses the
ethernet sub-interfaces (i.e. eth0:xx) and we are wondering why this is
and what we need to do to fix it. Any help would be greatly appreciated,
also please CC me personally as I am not currently on this mailing list.
Thanks.
