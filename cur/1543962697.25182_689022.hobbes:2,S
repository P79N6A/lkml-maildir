Not sure what do you mean, it currently seem to "depend" on X86_VISWS:
config FB_SGIVW
        tristate "SGI Visual Workstation framebuffer support"
        depends on FB && X86_VISWS
        select FB_CFB_FILLRECT
        select FB_CFB_COPYAREA
        select FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT

(Obviously it assumes both TULIP and E1000E required MII which is not
exactly the case)
But it makes a perfect sense, I can have modular drivers for (few)
hardware devices (just in case I want to rmmod etc) but most of the
kernel may be not modular. It would be nice if the Kconfig ask me if
I want to "select" the dependency Y or M, even if there is only one
way to make "select" dependencies happy (not counting "Y vs "M").
