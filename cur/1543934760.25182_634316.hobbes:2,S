From the off-list communication I have had there is indeed an interest.
It sort of stopped at one point due to missing integration in mainline.
What I refer to is mostly the mconf.c bits, but I would also like to
see what lkml says to a sample of .po files included in the kernel
for a number of languages.
One criteria to get a .po file integrated could be at least 10% of the
strings translated or similar.
