Good evening,
Could someone please point me to the correct resources regarding proper
setup of the various sound devices (/dev/cdrom, /dev/mixer, etc...) and
multiple X servers/sessions? I realize this is not the proper group, but
I have been searching google, the XFree86 website, ALSA website,
newsgroups, etc... and anywhere else I can think of on and off for a few
months now. I'm currently running FedoraCore on an ASUS A7N8X Deluxe
motherboard, but I don't really think the particular hardware or version
of Linux is the problem. I hope it's just a missed configuration issue.
Each of these devices seems to only be available to the first X session
to logon.
I've bypassed this restriction for CD Audio by creating device files for
all 4 users of this machines, and then configuring their preferred
cd-player app to poing at their device file. It works fine. Any
logged-in user can now play cd's.

My problem now is /dev/mixer, I think. Only the first logged-in user
gets any system sounds.
Before I go further, am I missing something obvious?
Please Cc: me !
Thank you all in advance,
