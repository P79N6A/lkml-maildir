Except they aren't all the same. At the very least, most architectures
don't agree on the linker section, some don't agree on alignment, and
others don't agree on initialization. Most people set the initial stack
from assembly on entry, others do it differently.
Having said that, there likely are some things that could be made
generic, it's basically just init_task and init_thread_union where there
are disagreements. The rest could likely be stashed in
kernel/init_task.c (although you'd have to carefully examine the
alignment for each architecture, particularly the ones that have special
__asm__ labels).
Perhaps having everyone use the same linker section for init_task and
moving that to asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h is a reasonable first step.
