Because I have seen it - I have instrumented it.
Your usage patterns are pretty tame actually. I remember having 100 
processes
randomly reading from the same part of the disk was one of my test cases.
You need direct IO otherwise everything ends up in pagecache.
I haven't seen workloads where it gets used a lot, but that doesn't mean 
they
don't exist, and I've never seen the code cause any problems, so there is no
need to make any trade offs by removing it.
