That would be the obvious way, but that option is not presented to me :)
Look at

Tangent:  Red Hat's bugzilla has a 'NEEDINFO' status which is quite 
useful too.

I'm willing to wait and see how things settle out in a few weeks.  I 
doubt it will be a huge problem for me personally, but as we see on the 
mailing lists already, there are plenty of bogus net stack bug reports 
[I know, I posted one just today and got corrected by Alexey].  I forsee 
David having a much bigger problem with potential bugzilla-related grunt 
work...
If you think back to what I first proposed, the original idea was to 
minimize the grunt work on kernel developers so we could focus on 
solving the tough problems :)  As I said back then, that definitely 
implies some useful help from staff and community to keep the bug 
database clean.  I think Andi Kleen mentioned that Mozilla project has 
bugs begin life as pre-screened... I think that's a pretty good model. 
Since you pointed out that Bugzilla supports that model from a technical 
standpoint, all we need are the pre-screeners to help us out... :)
