I think we really should have support for doing cache flushes 
automatically on fsync, etc. User space code should not have to worry 
about this problem, it's pretty silly that for example MySQL has to 
advise people to use hdparm -W 0 to disable the write cache on their IDE 
drives in order to get proper data integrity guarantees - and disabling 
the cache on IDE without command queueing really slaughters the 
performance, unnecessarily in this case.
There may be some cases where the controller provides a battery-backed 
cache and thus we don't want to actually force the controller to flush 
everything out to the drive on fsync, so we may need to be able to 
disable this, but these controllers may ignore flushes anyway. I know 
IBM ServeRAID appears to fail requests for write cache info and so the 
kernel assumes drive cache: write through and doesn't do any flushes.

Yes, ideally doing all writes to the drive with write cache enabled and 
then flushing them out afterwards would be much more efficient (at least 
  when no command queueing is involved) since the drive can choose what 
order to complete the writes in.
