Hi Ingo,
   OK, I've been running -rt10 for the last couple of hours on a new
kernel without SMP. No xruns so far at 64/2. I'm doing all the normal
stuff. emerge sync, building some code outside of portage, playing
music. Very good so far, but it will likely take 4-6 hours for me to
be more sure saying it was just SMP latencies.
   I see you're putting out -rt updates faster than I can build & test
them so I decided to stick with -rt10 for now to ensure a fair
comparison. I'll catch up with -rt12 or later sometime this evening to
tomorrow.
   Until then, one question. Yesterday I set priorities as such:
Jack - 80
Sound card - 80
1394 drive - 61
SATA drive 60
   What exactly do these numbers mean? If the 1394 drive was a 79
instead of a 61 would it change anything? Or does the system just
prioitize them numerically but operate on the highest numbered request
in which case a 79 vs. 61 wouldn't matter ?
Thanks,
Mark
