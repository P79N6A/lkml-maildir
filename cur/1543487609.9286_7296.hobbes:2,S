I guess we do agree to a point. I'm still of the opinion that OUR work
(people who are not Linus) has become more important than Linus' work alone.
If we do no testing of patches and peer reviews of ideas and just ship
everything off to Linus, he will not be able to handle the workload and
probably just ignore it all. It is our RESPONSIBILITY to prescreen code and
ideas. I don't think Linux would be nearly as good as it is without this
process. I'm not trying to diminish Linus' accomplishments at all. I still
think he is a brilliant human, but he is only one man; they don't perform
well under extremely high load situations. Having other people say no to
questionable ideas or code before Linus even knows them can be a really good
thing. Guess what. No one has to listen to those people either. :-) You CAN
bug Linus directly if you want, I just don't think it is always the best
thing to do.
I think I've said all I have to say. Sorry again for being offtopic. I think
the subject may be important to some and not to others. To the real people
doing the work, I appologize for the waste of time and I thank you all (I'll
buy you a beer if you ever in Denver. :-)
