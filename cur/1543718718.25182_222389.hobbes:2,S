Hrm... right indeed.

Well, the original scenario triggering that from userland is, imho, so
broken, that we may just not care losing that dirty bit ... Oh well :)
Anyway, apply my patch. If pte is not present, this will have no effect,
if it is, it makes sure we never leave a stale HPTE in the hash, which
is fatal in far worse ways.
