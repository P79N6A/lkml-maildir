Probably your threads have some mean of synchronization and do not wildly
write all over their MM but each thread into some private memory area and
some shared area synchronized by Semaphores (or whatever).
So the core for the SIGSEGV thread is likely to contain useful info for
debugging and we shouold dump it to disk. core-$PID is a good idea, however.
