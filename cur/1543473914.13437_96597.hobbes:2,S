Hi Michael:
> Yes, your patch is completely broken, ouch! 
mebbe. it did the right thing for me for the pci and x86 choices (the
only choice's in arch/i386). but it wouldnt surprise me if overall it
was a bad patch.
i.e., using my stinky patch, isnt this correct .config for a choice of
CONFIG_M586:
# Processor type and features
#
# CONFIG_M386 is not set
# CONFIG_M486 is not set
CONFIG_M586=y
# CONFIG_M586TSC is not set
# CONFIG_M686 is not set
CONFIG_WP_WORKS_OK=y
CONFIG_INVLPG=y
CONFIG_BSWAP=y
...and for CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS:
CONFIG_PCI=y
CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS=y
# CONFIG_PCI_GODIRECT is not set
# CONFIG_PCI_GOANY is not set
CONFIG_PCI_BIOS=y
CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS=y
# CONFIG_PCI_OPTIMIZE is not set
CONFIG_PCI_OLD_PROC=y
i guess the question really is: should xconfig be fixed to handle more 
types of conidtionals or not. if it should i could see digging into
the internals of fix_choice_cond(), otherwise .....
whatchya think?
