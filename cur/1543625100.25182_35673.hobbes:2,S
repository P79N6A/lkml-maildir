So next freeze! (The 4th or 5th today!)
Now I got "hda:lost interrupt", ext3 partitions where all mounted with
the "debug" option and the console log level was set to 8 with
ALT-SysRq-8.
Both Caps-Lock and Scroll-Lock LEDs where flashing, what does this mean?
Again only the reset button worked ...
Thanks again, Richard
