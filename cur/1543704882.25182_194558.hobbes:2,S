Hi all,
still having problems with ACPI on ASUS M2N. [1]
With linux-2.6.2-rc2-mm1 with acpi4asus from CVS as of today:
Suspending to disk (S4) suspends just fine. It also finds the file and
reads the data back into active memory, as well. But when it comes to
the message
 "Waiting for DMAs to settle down." 
the machine suddenly crashes (reboot).
I tried to get some debugging output by not having swap mounted when
trying to suspend so it would have to come right back up. Here is the
output
Suspend Machine: Suspend failed, trying to recover...
Restarting tasks...<3>bad: scheduling while atomic!

Suspend to RAM (S3 via 3bios) seems to suspend the machine just
fine. Only the power button brings it back up, but when it comes back
up it seems to hang -- cannot tell as even though the disk seems to
have come activity the screen remains black and network apparently
doesn't come up.
Hope this helps tracking down the ACPI problems.
Help appreciated, if more input is needed, please let me know.
Regards,
Georg
