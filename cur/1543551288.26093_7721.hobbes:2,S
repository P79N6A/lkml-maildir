	What different compiler?  If you're talking about the kernel-package
package of Debian, that's only scripts to generate a Debian kernel package
from custom source.
	As an aside, with all the griping that people do about gcc, i'm still
impressed that it can be used to compile both apps and the kernel.  Granted,
this is mainly because of hacks in the kernel to make gcc compile it
correctly, but it's still a decent C compiler.  g++ on the other hand . . .
