I have now bisected the kernel (to the point where I made a guess) and
found that reverting this commit fixes my problem:

After reverting, all buttons work as expected -- no lost syncs. I
might add that my laptop is Acer Aspire 5720ZG. Also, the button in
question is not truly a middle button; when operating correctly, it is
used for scrolling (up/down). Now what can be done to make both models
work correctly?
Kind regards,
