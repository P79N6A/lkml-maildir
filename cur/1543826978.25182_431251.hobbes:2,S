I don't see anything that bad here.  E.g.
[peterw@heathwren SMP]$ /usr/bin/time make clean
make -C /home/peterw/KERNELS/PlugSched/MM-2.6.17-rc4-mm1 
O=/kbuild/Plugsched/MM-2.6.17-rc4-mm1/SMP clean

[peterw@heathwren SMP]$ withcap -C 900 /usr/bin/time make clean
make -C /home/peterw/KERNELS/PlugSched/MM-2.6.17-rc4-mm1 
O=/kbuild/Plugsched/MM-2.6.17-rc4-mm1/SMP clean

[peterw@heathwren SMP]$ withcap -C 100 /usr/bin/time make clean
make -C /home/peterw/KERNELS/PlugSched/MM-2.6.17-rc4-mm1 
O=/kbuild/Plugsched/MM-2.6.17-rc4-mm1/SMP clean

[peterw@heathwren SMP]$
These are worse than predicted by my tests for single processes leading 
me to the opinion that the make clean actually consists of a number or 
serially executed CPU intensive tasks whose total usage adds up to the 
reported times.  My tests (starting a background task before and another 
after running "make clean" and using the difference in their reported 
pids as an estimate of how many tasks were involved in the "make clean") 
indicate that there were about 660.  This gives them each an average 
duration of about 3 milliseconds (based on a total elapsed time of 1.98 
seconds).  Even with HZ of 1000 that's only about 3 jiffies and is well 
and truly in the "too short to do reasonable capping" basket.
