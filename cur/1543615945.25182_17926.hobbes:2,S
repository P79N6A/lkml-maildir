It looks like you all are going to turn the scheduler upside-down.
Hmm, as a non-kernel-hacker observer from the world outside, could I
make a suggestion ?
Is it easy to split the thing in steps:
- Move from single-queue to per-cpu-queue, with just the same algorithm
  that is running now for per-queue scheduling.
- Get that running for 2.18.18 and 2.5.2
- Then start to play with the per-queue scheduling algorithm:
	* better O(n)
	* O(1)
	* O(1) with different queues for RT and non RT
	etc...
Is it easy enough or are both steps so related that can not be split ?
Thanks.
