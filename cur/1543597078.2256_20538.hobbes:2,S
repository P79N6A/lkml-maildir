There's more than the event collapsing inside the patch.
I saw the Luban's work but I decided to use the Lever-Provos /dev/poll as a
performance meter ( and the old poll() obviously ).
This coz I read papers where RT signals implementations resulted to have less
performance when compared to /dev/poll.

Here You can find the new statistics with 16000 connections :

I cannot reach that number of connections of the test machine coz the socket
buffer space will eat all my memory ( 128 Mb ).
Anyway the graph speaks quite clear about the tendency to greater numbers of
connections.

Thanks, the page is a work in progress anyway.
