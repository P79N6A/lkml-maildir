The GPL'd "hwinfo" command shipped with SUSE queries the BIOS setting by
reading a single byte from /dev/mem.
In src/hd/bios.c around line 262 it has:
  if(hd_data->bios_ram.data) {
    bios_ram = hd_data->bios_ram.data;
[snip]
    bt->led.scroll_lock = bios_ram[0x97] & 1;
    bt->led.num_lock = (bios_ram[0x97] >> 1) & 1;
    bt->led.caps_lock = (bios_ram[0x97] >> 2) & 1;
    bt->led.ok = 1;
Cut-n-paste commands to get to the source:
cd /tmp
wget 
http://ftp.opensuse.org/pub/opensuse/distribution/SL-OSS-factory/inst-source/suse/src/hwinfo-13.21-3.src.rpm
rpm2cpio < hwinfo-13.21-3.src.rpm | cpio -id
tar jxf hwinfo-13.21.tar.bz2
cd hwinfo-13.21/src/hd
