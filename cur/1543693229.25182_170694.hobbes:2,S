Hi,
I have a process which requires about 1G of shared memory.
There are multiple processes which are going to share this.
I am able to allocate this by setting shmmax..etc. 
This works fine if this is the only process running.
The problem is, I am not aware that during production if the arena
which I am going to allocate just  might be used by some other process.
Please let me know if there is method to handle this issue and a method
to check for the memory map at runtime.
Regards,
