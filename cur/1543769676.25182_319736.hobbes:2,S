Um... I don't know when you last used Windows, but most Linux desktop
GUI apps are way more bloated than the Windows counterparts.  Take a
look at some of the Gnome bounties for reducing bloat - some of them are
just embarassing.
Quick demo: with a recent Gnome, open the file selector dialog, and
browse to /usr/bin.  The disk goes nuts for 20 seconds before the file
list is even displayed.  Now hit cancel and try it again.  No disk
activity this time, but the CPU pegs for 7-8 seconds before the files
are displayed.
Now try the same on Windows.  It's instantaneous.
