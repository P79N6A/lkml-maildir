it seems one of my scsi drive is a bit broken (caching, at least).
sorry for invalid numbers. on another drive I see following:
w/o extents:
[root@zefir root]# /root/db2.sh 2 16
Throughput 119.199 MB/sec 16 procs
Throughput 106.09 MB/sec 16 procs
Average: 112.64450
with extents:
[root@zefir root]# /root/db2.sh 2 16
Throughput 156.846 MB/sec 16 procs
Throughput 170.591 MB/sec 16 procs
Average: 163.71850
so, this time improvement is about 45%
I can't explain this yet. need to be investigated carefully
