were wrong in MAINTAINERS.  I sent them both requests to fix it.]

This can stand pretty well on its own and I figure if it gets into
2.6.29 everyone will at least be patching files on the right path.  I'm
hoping to have the complete inotify, dnotify, audit, and even fanotify
out and hopefully ready for 2.6.30.
Since this is reasonably useful today and I know others are looking at
inotify I figured I'd get it in as soon as possible so when I do try to
push all my crap that'll be the only conflict, not this moving of
files...
