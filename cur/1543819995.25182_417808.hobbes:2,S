Maybe. I thought I'd actually done it once before, but I couldn't
actually find it when I went looking. It should save about 40KiB of RAM
on my Nokia 770, because I should get 145 jffs2_node_frag objects in
each slab page instead of only 127 -- so yes, I like it too :)

Plenty more words in the git commit. They don't make much sense without
the patch right below them, and you can see them in juxtaposition at 
http://git.infradead.org/?p=users/dwmw2/rbtree-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=1975e59375756da4ff4e6e7d12f67485e813ace0

I think it's be better just to drop the RB_RED and RB_BLACK definitions.

Yeah, I suppose we could.
