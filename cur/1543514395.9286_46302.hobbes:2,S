Is there something "special" required for the kernel "net" drivers to see
more than one "identical" card?  I Have two WD8013 cards set up as:
Card 1:  IRQ = 10             Card 2: IRQ = 11
         IO  = 0x280                  IO  = 0x300
         MEM = d000                   MEM = d800
Under Linux 2.2.13, the "wd" driver autoprobes but only sees Card#1 - there
is no sign of Card#2 at all.  Nothing else in the machine interferes with
these settings.  "Dos" diag programs from SMC confirm both working OK
simultaneously.
My conf.modules has:
alias eth0 wd
alias eth1 wd   <--- Not sure what to put here? Is this right?
Under RedHat 6.1, I do:
   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup eth1
Nothing.
I do:
   ifconfig eth1
Nothing either.  Any ideas on what I'm doingwrong would be greatly
appreciated.
