The same can still go for this, but instead of stopping at 2.6.x+2 we could
stop at 2.6.x+6 (or +5), and just not care about 2.6.x+[1-4].  But that
would be strong enough for those that would like the stable branch to
maintain it themselves.  Currently it'l hard to pick a 2.6.x that you want
to stay with since the 2.6.x.y is stopped right after 2.6.x+1 is out.  But
if not all 2.6.x has a .y, then that would focus more distrobutions or
whatever to pick the same one to support.
Oh well, I'm just spitting out a bunch of lip service here. It actually
seems interesting to try, and if I actually had a need to do this, I
would. But right now my focus is elsewhere.
