Tony,
That was part of the commit that _caused_ the regression actually.
Looking at my first mail I realize I dropped one line when I cut+pasted
that first line from the git show on that one.  If you look toward the
bottom of my original mail you will see it except I missed the line:
commit 8c8eb78f673c07b60f31751e1e47ac367c60c6b7
FYI, I did a git pull yesterday just before I hit this issue so I should
have had the latest stuff.
