I have no objections to VIO servers speaking SCSI ... if you want to do
that, I suggest you look at an existing example, like
drivers/scsi/ibmvscsi (the actual communication piece is very ppc
hypervisor specific, though).
However, I do strongly believe that using SCSI for devices which truly
aren't SCSI (i.e. you have to code a shim in the driver between the SCSI
commands and whatever your device speaks) is wrong ... if SCSI has
features that the generic block layer doesn't, then we need to move the
function from SCSI to block to give you access ... in theory this was
the rationale for having libata as the last "fake" SCSI driver, so we
could identify this functionality and begin to move it.

For this, it sounds like you might find nbd a more enticing
proposition ... it already is partition independent and is basically a
block to net socket exporter.
