Thanks to Paul Mackerras's report, I sent a patch for this a few hours ago:
  [PATCH 2.6.13-rc6] cpu_exclusive sched domains build fix
It just makes a local copy of the cpumask_t in a local variable on the stack.
I'm still a couple of hours from actually verifying that ppc64 builds with
this - due to unrelated confusions on my end.  Perhaps you or Mackerras will
report in first, to verify if this patch works as advertised.
