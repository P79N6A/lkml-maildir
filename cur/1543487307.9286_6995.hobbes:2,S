	An ordinary CDROM is used with scsi to get 
audio to filesystem (mounted via NFS) . After a few
uses, cdparanoia goes into D state, and won't catch KILL.
	eject, cdrecord, etc., if invoked, will then go into
the D state as well.
	I have tried 2.0.36, 2.2.0, 2.2.1, and they all
show this behavior.
	strace shows eject hanging when opening /dev/scd0
 cdrecord uses the generic interface and hangs when trying to
write .
	The ide hard drive light will also stay lit for a long
period (10 min) after the hang and then may or may not go out.
