s/C/compiler/
Or were you _really_ advocating the kind of development methodology which
gave us all those gotos to out-of-line code which gcc helpfully moved back
in-line for us when it got a little smarter because someone else observed 
the same problem and fixed it _properly_?
Tweaking your code and sacrificing chickens until you happen to get the
output you want is no substitute for fixing the compiler. And it's a waste 
of good chickens.
