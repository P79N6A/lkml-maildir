Yes I have. By editing it, I was able to test both the 3c59x 
and the 3c90x drivers. Also the modules were correctly loaded
in both testruns, which I confirmed with a lsmod.
On another note: I *was* able to set up the card manually
by doing an ifconfig (and it worked that way), but as the
firewall adapts dynamically to the DHCP leases, this
is not a solution. So only DHCP negotiation was not working,
which worked OK with the vanilla RH 6.2 2.2.14 kernel.
