If one insists on not using modules, then it's quite possible to
generate a configuration which won't compile as bzImage either.
In addition, there's at least one combination of options that compiles
under zImage and NOT under bzImage, although I have to admit being
very surprised when I came across it a while back. It was with kernel
2.2.3 not long after it was released, and long since deleted, I'm
afraid, but it certainly existed...

My experience has been that bzImage is rather picky about the
configurations that work - even on the systems that will boot
bzImages, I've never managed to get one to boot with sound hard
compiled in, even when the same combination boots and works fine
as a zImage. Yes, I know that shouldn't make any difference, but
I can assure you it does...
Best wishes from Riley.
