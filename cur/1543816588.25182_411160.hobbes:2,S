Hey Jeff,
Using Bill's original patch I was able to boot up perfectly with adma support 
enabled on my workstation. Even after several stress tests ( 
tar -cf /dev/null . , and dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null ), everything seems to 
be a-ok. However when I tried the sata_nv.c file that you sent to Bill, I 
kept on getting hardlocks, and thus was unable to stress test your version. 
Also for note, I heve not received any of the timeout problems reported by 
Bill. Nor have I had any latency problems with adma enabled.
