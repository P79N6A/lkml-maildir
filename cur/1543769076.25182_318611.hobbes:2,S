I am writing a Linux Security Module that needs SHA1 support very early in 
the kernel startup (before any fs are mounted,modules are loaded,  or 
files are mapped; including initrd). Therefore, I use the __initcall 
to initialize the security module. SHA1 can currently be used only 
through the crypto-api (static definitions and hidden context structure).
This crypto-API, however, initializes AFTER the security module
code in the __initicall block. Currently, I use the following patch into 
the main Linux Makefile to start up the crypto-API earlier:
diff -uprN linux-2.6.12-rc3_orig/Makefile 
linux-2.6.12-rc3-ima-newpatch/Makefile

Generally, I can think of the following solutions:
a) initialize crypto api in a initblock earlier than __initcall
b) make crypto functions global in the kernel and make crypto-api
    usage optional (goes against the idea of the api)
c) re-implement SHA1 for my LSM (won't be accepted)
d) the above patch (acceptable?)
Is there a preferred/accepted way to handle this startup-sequence problem?
