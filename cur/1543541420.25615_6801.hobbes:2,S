Hi.
After applying your patch I get an #error:
n file included from radio-miropcm20.c:13:
../sound/miroaci.h:9: #error Compiling a driver that needs the ACI-mixer but without ACI-mixer support
This code is modified by our patch and triggers the abobe if the following
does not hold:
#if defined(CONFIG_ACI_MIXER) || (defined(CONFIG_ACI_MIXER_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
CONFIG_ACI_MIXER should be CONFIG_SOUND_ACI_MIXER (per the sound/Config.in).
I can find no place where something like CONFIG_ACI_MIXER_MODULE should be
set so I removed this part completely (and probably unwisely :) ). The
resulting patch (again, against your patch) is as follows:

Question: If you could live forever, would you and why?  
Answer: I would not live forever, because we should not live forever,
because if we were supposed to live forever, then we would live forever,
but we cannot live forever, which is why I would not live forever.
