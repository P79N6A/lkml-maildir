Yes he did (although he did say it would be ok if spinlocks were made 
out of line to make up for the text size increase in the spinlock 
assembly) and Ingo said his preempt_enable on contention spinlock changes 
should have the same effect, however how about the case where we hold a 
lock above the contended one (so preempt is disabled) and interrupts enabled? 
At least with this we still process interrupts, plus it can coexist with 
the preempt friendly spinlock changes. Ingo?
