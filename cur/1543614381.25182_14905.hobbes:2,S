Something like that.  It needs to be a large enough range to reasonably 
support the maximum number of expected syscalls that could possibly be in 
testing at one time (which is a total guesstimate if you ask me), and it 
should hopefully be up high so that we aren't allocating new numbers around 
it.  However, I think it needs to be allocated *regardless* of whether Linus 
takes the patch into his kernel.  Even if the patch is simply used outside 
Linus's kernel, it still needs the allocation to truly be safe.
