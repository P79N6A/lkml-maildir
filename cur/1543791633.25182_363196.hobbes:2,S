I said the same thing when I first saw this, but I wanted to send the 
patches separately, because Kirk wrote the driver, and I corrected the 
above issue in a separate patch:
dvb-determine-tuner-write-method-based-on-nxt-chip.patch
Feel free to fold them if you like... I was only trying to indicate separate authorship.
As for the other comments for the rest of the patch series, some of the fixes are trivial.  Should I expect that you will correct these?  or do you need me to send you more patches?
For now, I think the corrections should wait for Johannes' return, 
unless you want to take care of them.  I think he comes back JUST after 
the end of the merge window... not quite sure.
I have 3 or 4 more patches coming.... I plan to send before the end of 
tonight.
Regards,
Michael Krufky
