Yep, Alan introduced a maxbytes field to the superblock which is not
set in swapfs. So the vfs will always fail with EFBIG. 
I will send out a patch soon.

The vfs allows multiple mount with 2.4, and for swapfs you always get
a fresh instance with its own resource limits. Think anout chroot with
its own swapfs instance. AFAIK the new util-linux will give you some
checking.

Your bootup script sets the mode after mounting? The mode parameter is
functional for me and the default is 777. 1777 has to be done in user
space.
