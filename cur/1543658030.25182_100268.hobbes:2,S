Why not formalise this in the Linux COPYING file?
It would make things clear, would help people like Andre and
corporations like NVidia to continue to bring drivers to linux. Not a
single person who matters (ie actual kernel contributors) has so far
expressed any opinion (eg in the rash of GPL threads currently
ongoing) that would indicate they are not happy with the current
status quo as detailed in the above post by Linus.
If EXPORT_SYMBOL kernel functions are LGPL (bar the 
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL) formalise it in .../COPYING. (and peace can reign 
on l-k once again :) ).
