Hi!
I write to report success of 2.6.0-test9 on a heavy loaded (2m hits a day)
proxy server running squid.
It worked 3 days under load without a glitch.
Some notes:
	1. ATA TCQ does not work here, I had to disable it. Turning it on
	   later leads to instant data corruption.
	2. Nice value seems to be more significant in 2.6 than in 2.4, but
	   I think it is good.
My config:
	P4 1.80GHz, 640MB ram, 2x40MB ibm ide disks (IC35L040AVVN07-0).
	ext3 filesystems.
