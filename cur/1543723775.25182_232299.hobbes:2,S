They are known not to work with -fpic (on x86 anyway, other architectures
are less broken).  Anyway, just because there is no #ifdef __KERNEL__
doesn't mean a kernel header is meant for user space use.

They are duplicated in <sys/syscall.h> (which is auto-generated from the
list in <asm/unistd.h>).

Only if pipe(2) uses the "two retvals" calling convention (Alpha and ia64,
but not x86 or m68k).  But then, pipe is already available without
syscall(), and new syscalls normally use simple enough calling conventions
that are suitable for syscall().
