PPC also guarantees every ordering when using the 'sync' instruction, so
that will give correctness at the price of a 1000 cycles or so.  You
refer to different rules for cached vs uncached on other implementations
-- that is the essence of our problem.  Are there different barrier
instructions in MIPS which provide different levels of performance for
different ordering enforcements?
