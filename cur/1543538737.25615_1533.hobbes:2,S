Page aging is the solution here. Doing proper page aging
allows us to make the distinction between use-once pages
and pages which are used over and over again.
And the best part is that we can do that without regard
for what type of cache a page happens to be in. We replace
pages based on observing their usage pattern and not on
some assumptions we make based on what is (should be) in
the page....
