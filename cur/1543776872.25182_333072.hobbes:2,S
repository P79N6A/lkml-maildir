Sorry, no logs or dmesg to report; just performance.
Using kernel 2.6.12: USB flash drive (san-disk cruzer
micro) Copy FROM drive is normal and quick; copy TO
drive is amazingly slow. (30 minutes for 50K file).
Used same configuration as for 2.6.11.11. Cured by
going back to old kernel.
Sorry I can't give better report.
Thank you.
Joe Sevy
