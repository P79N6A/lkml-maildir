the first time, 2.2.9. gcc 2.7.2.3 libc5, it was : 
/dev/hda	affected hda3 as well as a mounted DOS fs.
/dev/hdb	OK
/dev/sda	OK
the 2nd time, 2.2.10. gcc 2.7.2.3 libc5 it was :
/dev/hda	OK
/dev/hdb	OK
/dev/sda1	affected
/dev/sda2	OK (but had to use backup blocks to e2fsck)
no strange DMA things changed or whatever. just what the OS thinks it's the
best for the system
(if I write sda, hda etc, I mean all partitions on the particular disk)
