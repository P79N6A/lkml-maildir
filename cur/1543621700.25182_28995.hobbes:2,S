Maybe the difference is in "what's the goal". For datarecovery we
don't really care about just a couple of bits here and there: We want
to piece together the whole thing. 
If you don't want a piece of your data getting into wrong hands
however, you'd better be safe than sorry.
So I (and the Ibas guy) are talking about practical recovery of a
useful amount of data, while even a couple of bits is in theory
dangerous if you really want it "gone".

Right.
