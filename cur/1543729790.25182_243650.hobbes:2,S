The write request will have to wait. Storage cannot do concurrent IO.
But all memory allocated in the read request will be GFP_NOIO or
GFP_ATOMIC so the conclusion of the memory allocation should not
wait for IO. Either it fails and we report that to the SCSI layer or it
is completed and the write serviced in turn.
At least that's the intent.
