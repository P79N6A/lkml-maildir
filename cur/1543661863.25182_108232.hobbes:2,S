hmms the data is not critical yet (i was just testing this server)
i really wonder why the crash was there in the first place
thing i found in /var/log/messages :
Feb  7 04:18:15 storage kernel: EXT3-fs error (device md(9,0)):
ext3_new_block:
Allocating block in system zone - block = 536875638
Feb  7 04:18:15 storage kernel: EXT3-fs error (device md(9,0)):
ext3_new_block:
Allocating block in system zone - block = 536875639
doesn't look ok to me (and explains the crash?)
makes me wonder if this can have todo with the lbd (to allow 2TB+ devices)
patch ? or is this something else?
(if it can be related to the lbd patch, i will remove 2 hd's from the
array (but i don't prefer this option))
also for not getting this thing again (that i can't fsck my filesystem)
what are the setting i can use for creating a large filesystem on /dev/md0
? (what is the maximum workable inodes?)
i did this :
mke2fs -j -m 0  -b 4096 -i 4096 -R stride=16
