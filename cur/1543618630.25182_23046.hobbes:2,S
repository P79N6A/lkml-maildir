Hi Mark,
Thanks for the note!  It turns out on this one I had been pretty inspired
and had already changed EVMS' status last night   :-)
You can see the latest update at:
http://kernelnewbies.org/status/
But I'm usually not that up to date, this is the exception that confirms 
the rule, so please keep me in the loop as you get closer to final 
release!  EVMS is a great project!
Cheers,
-- Guillaume
