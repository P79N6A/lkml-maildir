That clause only deals with some anthology works, not all.  It's an
exception to <<a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or
any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications...>>
It's pretty clear that the linux kernel is not a mere aggregation of
works on some volume of storage.
