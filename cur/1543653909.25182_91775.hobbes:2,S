hello.
i am running the 2.4.18-64GB-SMP kernel.  with this kernel, i have in my /lib/modules/2.4.18-64GB-SMP/ directory, the snd-emu10k1.o module.
i rebuilt my kernel to be 2.4.18-4GB-SMP.  in my new /lib/modules/2.4.18-4GB-SMP/ directory, i no longer have the snd-emu10k1.o module.
i searched with the command 'find /usr/src/ -name "snd-*"' , but there were no files found.
i am running the suse 8.0 professional distribution.
does anyone have any ideas of whats going on here?  am I missing some files? 
please help me
