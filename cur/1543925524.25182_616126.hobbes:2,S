We don't even have the cross-page-boundary constraint.
The real issue is that on i386 physical addresses are 64-bit while 
hypercall arguments are 32-bit.  A page frame number is 32-bit and so 
poses no issues.
I see two workarounds for this:
- make the first hypercall argument a u64 rather than a long (using two 
registers on i386)
- use an msr for registering the clock address
The first is more general, while the second has the nice property of 
taking care of live migration automatically.

If there are no technical issues, I have no objections.
