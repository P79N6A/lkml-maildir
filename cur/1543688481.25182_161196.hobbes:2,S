Be careful.  I remember discussing in probability class the liklyhood that
two people in a room with N people have the same birthday.  N does not have
to be anywhere close to 365 for your probability of a collision to be greater
than 50%.  I forget what the exact number is but its less than 30.  The
image problem sounds similar, depending on exactly how you phrase it.
Thanks,
