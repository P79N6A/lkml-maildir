First, I was talking about flexibility attained through the separation
of notions of file and index. You just claimed elsewhere that this is
the direction ntfs took (with the introduction of hard-links).
Then, every security model has its weakness and corner cases. Try to
express
        rw-r-xrw- (0656)
POSIX bits with canonical NT ACLs (hint: in NT allow-ACEs are
accumulated).

That very good property for a security model: simplicity is a virtue
here.
