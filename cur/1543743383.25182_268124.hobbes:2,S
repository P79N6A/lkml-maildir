The problem is in locking. You must not kill process while it is
in uninterruptible state because it is uninterruptible
for a reason - has taken semaphore, or get_cpu(), etc.
You do want it to do put_cpu(), right?
Processes must never get stuck in D, it's a kernel bug.
Find out how did process ended up in D state forever,
and fix it - that's what I'm trying to do
in these cases.
