Two words: partition names.  Amiga's RDB has them, along with other
things that make partitioning infinitely easier on Amigas than on PCs.
It's surprising to me that they apparently haven't been implemented
elsewhere.  Obviously partition names can clash, but in that case you
could use the old or devfs name to distinguish them.  (On the Amiga,
when partition names clash, most drivers [1] modify the name of the
clashing partition in some not-very-helpful way.)
[1] Unfortunately, the Amiga firmware including most of the OS had to
    fit into a 256K ROM for release 1.x.  Release 1.3 was the first to
    support bootable hard drives, which it did by allowing each disk
    controller's firmware to generate a list of partitions to mount and
    potential boot partitions.  RDBs were introduced at around this
    time as a standard format for storing this information on each
    disk.  Consequently some details of the implementation of RDBs are
    driver-specific.
