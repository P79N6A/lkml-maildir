yes, but for this there is an explicit mechanizm to lazy-MM during lengthy
system calls, an example is in buffer.c:
                user_mm = start_lazy_tlb();
                error = sync_old_buffers();
                end_lazy_tlb(user_mm);

yes. Constant copying contaminates the L1/L2 caches and creates dirty
cachelines all around the place. Fixed in 2.4 + TUX ;-)
