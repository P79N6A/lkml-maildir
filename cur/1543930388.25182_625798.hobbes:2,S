MIPS uses fixmap for two purposes:
 o In some cases it is possibly to avoid or optimize a cacheflush by creating
   a temporary mapping.  The mechanism works very similar to what x86 and
   MIPS use for atomic kmaps.
 o Highmem.
Both manipulate pagetables directly or even insert entries directly into
the TLB without pagetables as intermediate stage so __set_fixmap is indeed
unused.
