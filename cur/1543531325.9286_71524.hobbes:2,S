tmpfs has some differences; I don't know about mfs, but solaris' tmpfs
stores all directory information in-core, only putting file inodes and
data in swappable pages, it definitely seems like it has advantages.  It
also stores in-core structures in ADTs like b+trees and such.
It would be interesting to benchmark reiserfs against a memory
filesystem...
