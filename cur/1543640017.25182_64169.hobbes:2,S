There would be a solution to tell gcc not to optimize things, which may
not require too much work from gcc people. Basically, we would need to
implement a __builtin_nop() function that would respect dependencies but
not generate any code. This way, we could have :
	for (i=0; i<N, i++);
optimized as i=N
and
	for (i=0; i<N; i++)
		__builtin_nop();
or even
	for (i=0; i<N; __builtin_nop(i++));
do the real work.
This way, some loops could be optimized, and the developpers could explicitely
tell the compiler when they need to prevent any optimization.
Cheers,
Willy
