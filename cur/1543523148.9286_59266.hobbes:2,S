Well, I've noticed it happening occasionally ever since I started using
sawmill, and that was back when sawmill 0.16 was out.  I can't seem to
find anything that says the date when 0.16 was relesed, but I was
probably running the newest 2.3 at the time (before 2.3.25, for sure).
Hmm...Now I can't seem to reproduce it anymore. :(  I think it might only
be happening when I install a new version that has never been installed
before (this is when I see it, now that I think of it).  However,
deleting the directories and installing the newest version again doesn't
seem to show the problem.  Hmm...
I'll keep trying and let you know if I can figure it out.
