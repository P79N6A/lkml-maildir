Perhaps that patch was applied in test9-pre2?
Because Cardbus on this recent Dell laptop has
suddenly stopped working:
Sep 11 22:52:52 dell kernel: Yenta IRQ list 0498, PCI irq11
Sep 11 22:52:52 dell kernel: Socket status: 30000006
Sep 11 22:52:52 dell kernel: cs: cb_alloc(bus 2): vendor 0x10b7, device 0x0000
Sep 11 22:52:52 dell kernel: PCI: Failed to allocate resource 3 for PCI device 10b7:0000
Sep 11 22:52:52 dell kernel: PCI: Failed to allocate resource 4 for PCI device 10b7:0000
Sep 11 22:52:52 dell kernel: PCI: Failed to allocate resource 5 for PCI device 10b7:0000
Sep 11 22:52:52 dell kernel: PCI: Enabling device 02:00.0 (0000 -> 0003)
I don't see where we _ever_ scan behind a Cardbus bridge???
As a datapoint, this hack makes Cardbus work again:
