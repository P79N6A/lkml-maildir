I don't know of a proc entry that lets the user tell the VM not to cache
as much or use swap in a different manner.

I agree that keeping several threads would be difficult, but is there not
a way to have certain values plugged into the code for something like
cache pressure before swapping, or extended boot messages instead of a
quiet boot?  These values would be dependant on the config options that
were selected in the config.  I am not talking about forking the kernel.
I am instead talking about a process to select a different concept that
the same kernel runs under and have this concept selected at compile time.

This leaves several people out in the rain though.  First how would a
distro make a system that works well for the desktop users if the kernel
is designed to work well on servers?  Also I should be able to run debian
on my desktop if I want without having to suffer through interactivity
issues, because debian builds their distros for servers and has most of
the hard drives cached.  Also I know several people that recompile kernels
and such, but have no clue as the process to go through to optimize it for
their particular setup.  If people are hoping that linux will move into
other markets besides servers then you cannot have the attitude that
everyone has to suffer with a) what the distros give them or b) be come
fluent enought in kernel programming and desgin to be able to edit the
code so that it works better for them.
