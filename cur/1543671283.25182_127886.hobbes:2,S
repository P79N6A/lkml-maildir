Hi,
	I have installed Aurora 1.0 on a Sparc Ultra 60 workstation and have
a command line system running (X doesn't work yet but that's another
question for later).  
For sparc64 I realise that userland is 32 bits and Kernel space is 64 bits.
I have built a Kernel module in userland and I am trying to load it into the
Kernel.  I get the following error message:
[root@icarus kernel]# /sbin/insmod fred.o
fsx25.o: ELF file fred.o not for this architecture
I assume this is to do with the 32/64 bit issue.  What magic do I need to
place in my Makefile or tool do I need to use to build a module that can be
loaded.
I have spent a couple of hours searching with google but haven't found any
help in this matter.
Thanks
Kevin
