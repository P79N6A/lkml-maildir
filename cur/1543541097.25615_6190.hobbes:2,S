Subject: Minor Makefile/mkdep bug in 2.2.16

There's nothing currently to say that  53c7,8xx.o depends on
53c7xx_[ud].h in drivers/scsi/Makefile.  If these files are missing,
then --
     * mkdep ignores them, and
     * make doesn't know to rebuild them
I suggest  the following one-line patch:
Index: Makefile
