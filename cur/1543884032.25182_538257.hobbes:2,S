Surely "return 0;" is more efficient.
...and a minor nit about the comment: it doesn't trigger a printk(). It
rather triggers a dprintk(), (which should be turned off by default
unless you happen to be debugging the code).
The other nit is that I'm not sure the dprintk() is totally useless. It
is always nice to know _why_ the thing looped when you are debugging.
That said, we should perhaps rather put the dprintk() for that in
nfs4_handle_exception instead...
