   well, as i am on a solaris box for now, i can't check it but it seems to
   me it's not in the 169 official syscalls and thus may be optimized by
   not push/pop unused parameters. Am i wrong ?
push/pop is a characteristic of x86, on other architectures syscall
arguments are passed in fixed registers, and in fact this is true on
Intel when a function is marked as FASTCALL().

   Where ?
Via the SMP lock routines when compiling __SMP__.

   maybe we can turn this in a macro that developp in
   __real_flush_tlb_range on ia32 and other archs where it'sn't used ?
The compiler does this optimization for you.
Please, learn, quickly, that all the world is not x86.
