As you can see in my two latest post, I finnaly found that this was not 
the good BIOS for the motherborad. When I understand my mistake, I take 
the good BIOS version and I was able to flash it with FreeDOS over PXE 
network boot. So the netboot stuff was not the problem in my case.
The funny part is that with my motherboard, if you try to flash the 
wrong BIOS version you don't get any clear message agains this 
opearation. But this ended randomly into one of the following posibility:
1) system simply hang.
2) "division by zero error".
3) "failed opcode "<put some hexadecimal bytes here>.
4) immediate reboot.
I think that the BIOS update is an area where the mainboard makers have 
a hug possibility to improve there product...
