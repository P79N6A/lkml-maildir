Would not help much when "they" eat your memory by loading big bitmaps
into the X server which runs as root (it seems there are many programs
which are very good at this particular DOS ;) 
Also I think most oom situations are accidents anyways, not malicious users.
When you're the only user of the machine sophisticated per user accouting
won't be very useful.
