How do you know how to extract the items in order, unless you've already
sorted them independently from placing them in this data structure?
Besides, there are plenty of sorting algorithms that work only on
specific kinds of data sets that are better than the O(n log n) bound
for generalized sorting.  For example, there's the O(n) "mailbox sort".
You have an unordered array u of m integers, each in the range 1..n;
allocate an array s of n integers initialized to all zeros, and for i in
1..m increment s[u[i]].  Then for j in 1..n print j s[j] times.  If n is
of reasonable size then you can sort that list of integers in O(m) time.
