Holy crap, I didn't realize GMail auto-formatted mail in plain mode,
that was neigh unreadable.  Reformatted for legibility.
My appologies for the double-mail.

Subject: ISO9660 2GB/4GB limit? + UDF/loop conflict
To: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
I'm trying to use ISO9660 to make large file backups (4.3 or 8.1gb on
DVD/DVD-DL) but I'm hitting the 32bit limit.
A quick tweak to mkisofs will make it write 4gb-1 files, which are
apparently readable under linux.  That's something  I need to test.
I'm posting because I'm curious about the ISO spec, does it support
32bit files in any interchange level?  It looks like the limitation is
purely in the directory structure, as the single extent limt is 512mb.
It looks like the indirection supports 128tb, though I could be wrong,
it was a cursory look through the source.
If not, (and this isn't a kernel question) has anyone looked into
patching mkisofs to make pure UDF?   file->UDF mounted loopback->burn is
exceedingly slow and awkward, especially when backing up <2gb files goes
straight to DVD.
As a side note, udf -> loop -> reiser3 -> linux software raid5 is
obnoxiously slow, with vmstat showing 2-3x the block traffic it should.
dd bs=256k if=/dev/zero of=test
reiserfs->raid5:                  32MB/sec
reiserfs->loop->reiserfs->raid5   32MB/sec
udf -> loop -> reiserfs -> raid5   6MB/sec

That 2k blocksize isn't being handled intelligently AT ALL, no
buffering whatsoever. Reiserfs and raw dump to disk didn't show this
behavior.
UDF on raid5 directly has nearly no reads, and pulls a decent 15MB/sec.
I had to test that on a seperate raid array, so the initial results are
not directly comparable, but the lack of block-in does make me guess
that loop can't handle 2k blocksize, and is either doing 4k read + 4k
write, or is  breaking up the writes into 2k chunks that the raid5 is
barfing on.
