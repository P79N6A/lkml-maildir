It looks like you took invalid opcode exceptions in addition to some
rather suspicious oopsen in/around buffered_rmqueue(). The latter are
likely stack gunk, the former OTOH I suspect may be real.
Could you try to reproduce without CONFIG_REGPARM and turn on frame
pointers? Might help a bit to cut down on ways backtraces might get
misinterpreted.
