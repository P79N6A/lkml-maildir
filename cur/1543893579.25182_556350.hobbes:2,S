Looks like gcc didn't recognize max(8, ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN) as a
constant expression, so __kmalloc_size_too_large() got referenced
although it never got called as far as I can tell. Works like a charm
after applying this patch on top of yours.
Tested with CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=n, CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=y and
CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=y with slub_debug set.
