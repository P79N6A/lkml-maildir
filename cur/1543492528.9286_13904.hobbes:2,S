Hi there.  I keep getting this sort of thing in my syslog when
something's trying to play through /dev/dsp:
Apr  9 13:11:29 odin kernel: Sound error: Couldn't allocate DMA buffer 
Apr  9 13:12:00 odin last message repeated 48 times
Apr  9 13:13:01 odin last message repeated 121 times
...and yet, when it happens (just now, for instance), free tells me:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         95816      91756       4060      76060       4856      29388
-/+ buffers/cache:      57512      38304
Swap:        78864        564      78300
shouldn't that be enough memory?  even if the free memory isn't enough,
shouldn't it use some of the buffer/cache space instead?  or that whack o'
swap space?  or if it might have something to do with the memory being
fragmented, is there something i can do about it?
i'm using kernel 2.0.36 on a pentium 133; memory stats above. :)  sound
card is, um, i'm pretty sure it's a pci awe32 pnp soundblaster (not sure
about the pci part offhand.)  i'm using several kernel patches:
subs-patch-1.37
portfw-ftp-patch
loose-udp-2.0.36.patch
awedrv-0.4.3
this problem tends to occur once in a while, go on for a while and then
stop for longer periods.  as i type this it's been going on for longer
than i've noticed before.  ....now it's working again, and free says:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         95816      92632       3184      76248       6460      28328
-/+ buffers/cache:      57844      37972
Swap:        78864        564      78300
can anyone shed any light on this?  i've searched on the web and found
surprisingly little - mostly posts asking why it was happening, but no
responses.
if you need any more information about my system, let me know.
