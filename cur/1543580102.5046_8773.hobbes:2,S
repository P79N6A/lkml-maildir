I experience #2 and #3 on the following board w/ VIA KT133:
BIOS Vendor: American Megatrends Inc.
BIOS Version: 62710
BIOS Release: 07/15/97
Board Vendor: Gigabyte Technology Co. Ltd..
Board Name: 7ZX.
Board Version: 1.0.
ntpdate is run at boot..  
2:14am  up 14:59,  3 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
And i just ran it again after running uptime, it showed the following:
29 Jan 02:15:20 ntpdate[3879]: step time server 164.67.62.194 offset 11.398730 sec
This is 2.4.1per11 btw.
