I haven't tried it, but I assume this is still wrong. On cell,
we didn't actually hit the case where the init sections have
been overwritten, since we call __add_pages from an initcall.
However, the pages we add are not part of the early_node_map,
so early_pfn_in_nid() returns a bogus result, causing some
page structs not to get initialized. I believe your patch
is going in the right direction, but it does not solve the
bug we have...
