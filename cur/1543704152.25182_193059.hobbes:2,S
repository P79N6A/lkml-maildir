I beg to differ. Looking at my Bayesian filter dumps, I see something
quite different. All the words are English (if you will allow me to
count those various dyslectic spellings as being "English")...
I do on occasion get the odd oriental, French or Turkish(???) spam, but
the volumes are so small, it doesn't even register on the filters.
I have yet to receive any spam in my native Norwegian tongue. 8-)
