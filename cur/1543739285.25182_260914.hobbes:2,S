Currently, ps uses /proc/*/stat for that. The /proc/*/statm
file is read to determine TRS and DRS, which are broken now.
That it, unless you count "ps -o OL_m" format.
The top program uses /proc/*/statm for many more fields:
%MEM  Memory usage (RES)
VIRT  Virtual Image (kb)
SWAP  Swapped size (kb)
RES   Resident size (kb)
CODE  Code size (kb)
DATA  Data+Stack size (kb)
SHR   Shared Mem size (kb)
nDRT  Dirty Pages count

What exactly would be the difference, and when might users see it?
