Hi Li Yang.
In another thread we have discussed localized versions of Kconfig
files facilitating po files.
Will the community you represent here see any advantage in that and
would be interested to contribute?
What is generally seen as a showstopper is the amount of work needed
to do the translation - and keeping it up-to-date.
If lkml actually accept .po files in the kernel is not yet setteled
but no matter I would like kconfig to be extended to support it.
For this work help is needed too.
It is a pick-up of the Linux Kernel Translation project
(
http://tlktp.sourceforge.net/
) where several kconfig patches exists.
