Hello,
I probably found a small bug in the include/scsi/scsi.h of the 2.6.x 
series. I came over this when trying to compile program(s) with scsi 
support. They were complaining about u8 beeing undefined, or errors at this 
point. Now u8 is defined in linux/types.h but included in #ifdefs for 
kernel, so that in scsi.h it is only defined when compiling within kernel.
So I assume the best is to replace all u8 in scsi.h with __u8 which is also 
defined in "user" case. At least I did, and it compiled fine, and still 
works fine.
greets
Dennis
