maybe:
-[short reason]patchname.patch
Examples
-[upstream]patchname.patch for mainline or subsytem tree
-[junk]patchname.patch
-[update]patchname.patch for 'updated version will be merged'
Or, if you started to track how things got upstream, then you could easily
let people know where to go looking for it.
-[mainline]
-[x86]
-[gregkh]
Just a thought.
