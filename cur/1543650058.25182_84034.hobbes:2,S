Well after posting I continued to play around and found working
combinations.
   It certainly seems to be an ACPI issue. BIOS defaults in the
PNP/PCI Config screen are PNP OS = No, and all the PIRQ_#s
are set to auto. With my setup that yields IDE = IRQ 14, USBs
and Net = 10, Sound = 11, VGA = 9, HPT370 = 11 and ACPI = 11.
If I explicitly set any of the IRQ in a manner in which the HPT370
doesn't end up sharing IRQ with the ACPI controller the system
boots. The easiest way is to only explicitly set the HPT370 to IRQ
10. I don't know much about ACPI and don't know what the
significance of sharing the ACPI controller's IRQ is but this doesn't
seem to be an IRQ sharing issue as even with IDE =14, ACPI =11,
and every other PCI device sharing IRQ 10 the kernel comes up
with out issue. Also setting PNP OS either way doesn't seem to
relevant.
