it's nohz=off not no_hz=off

Well, you run in periodic mode then.

We optimize for the non-idle path, i.e. we keep the timer running as
long as we are not idle. Once we go idle we reprogram it.
I looked at the patch and as far as I can understand it, there is
nothing obviously wrong about it.
One remark: why did you expand the clocksource to be 64 bit? The generic
code handles the 32 bit wrap already, so the expansion in your read
routine is adding overhead. The counter will wrap every 24 seconds, so
there is nothing to worry about.
The behavior you are describing is might be related to some problem with
the clocksource readout, as the reprogramming values are calculated from
there.
