That would be the fastest way of finding out, maybe.
But I'd rather use a uniform way of notifying about readiness events.
Rather than using a new API (acceptEx :-) or a rule ("always ready initially"),
when not just deliver the initial readiness event via the usual channel?
And for ease of coding for the moment, David can just deliver
a 'ready for everything' event initially unconditionally.
No API changes, just a simple, uniform way of tickling the user's
"I gotta do I/O" code.
