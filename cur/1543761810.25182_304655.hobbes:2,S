No, that's not a reliable solution.
What it comes back to is that we _need_ driver match priorities, so we
can detect when a more specific driver for the device is loaded (iow
one which matches by vendor+device rather than just class), unbind the
existing driver, and bind the more specific one.
I've been mentioning this need for over a year now (for a different
scenario) and it hasn't particularly been going anywhere.  However,
your case boosts the reason why we need this functionality.
