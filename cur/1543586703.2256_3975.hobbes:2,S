I have two Adaptec 2930CU (ultra narrow) cards. I modified the driver to
make them work in ultra mode. The card connected to my CDROM and MO drive,
operating at different bus clocks, does not behave well. Transfers stop
often for 10-20 seconds and it spits out warnings like these:

No probs with the old driver.
