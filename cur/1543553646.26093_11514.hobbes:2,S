The problem (AFAIU) is that if the levels aren't set on startup, they are
random in some cases. So you'd have to save (at least) the fact that they
have been initalized. Just that would be easy: Set aside a word in the
kernel, which is set to 0 when booting, and which then gets the value 1
when the hardware is initialized. For more fancy stuff, splitting the
module into data/code (as I suggested) should do the trick with minimal
impact on the rest.
