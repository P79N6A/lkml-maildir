On a separate note, since atime updates are not usually very important
anyway, why not have an option to cache atime updates for a long time,
or until either a write occurs anyway.  Holding a large number of
atime updates in a write cache is generally not going to be a major
issue - the worst case if a partition isn't cleanly unmounted is that
some atimes will be wrong.
