While I would like to see scsi scan pick up / print  serial numbers or a
form of device UUID  I have to agree with Eddie that this patch would only
provide data for devices that decided to fill in the vendor specific area
of the standard inquiry page.
A more generic solution would involve two more inquiry commands to the
device using the EVPD bit. The first would be to request page 0 and then
working from highest to lowest use page 0x83, 0x80, stanard inquiry page
(vendor, product, serial). In some cases though with really old devices
this still might not generate useful information.
