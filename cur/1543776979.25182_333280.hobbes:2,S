SUSV3 says this for select():
"If SA_RESTART has been set for the interrupting signal, it is
implementation-defined whether the function restarts or returns with
[EINTR]"
and says nothing for poll()...
But it says nothing also for "pause()", for example... and I doubt that
it's supposed to be automatically restarted :)
