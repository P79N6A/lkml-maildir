Right now, slab is not really suitable for GFP_ZERO:
- if debug is enabled, then objects are definitively not 0-initialized.
- if a ctor is used for zero initialization, then objects would have to 
be zeroed before kmem_cache_free: The ctor is only called at object 
creation, not before object reuse. But memset(,0,) just before free 
would be a bit silly.
Probably a BUG_ON or WARN_ON should be added into kmem_flagcheck() and 
into kmem_cache_create().
Should I write a patch?
