It's known and will be automagically fixed as soon as the new HDLC code 
goes in (see message of Krzysztof Halasa on l-k the 2002/01/07).
There's (short) documentation at <URL:
http://www.cogenit.fr/dscc4/>
 for the
brave who wants to play with it. An other patch has been sent to allow the 
driver to handle syncppp operation.
Bug the official HDLC maintainer if you want him to push his work. :o)
PS: I read l-k
