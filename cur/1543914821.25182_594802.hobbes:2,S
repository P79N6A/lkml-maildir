It's extremely hard to understand what it is that you're saying. Perhaps if
I explain the two things I first thought when you posted this, it will
explain why your post is vague:
1) *Any* task will use the CPU to 100% while it's running. Even if you ask
the computer to add 1 to 1, while it's doing that add for you, the task is
using 100% of the CPU.
2) If you ask the CPU to do any task over and over again as quickly as it
can, and it has nothing else to do, that task will get 100% of the CPU?
So what are you really asking?
