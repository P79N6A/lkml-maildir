No this doesn't work. The decision which address space layout to use is done 
in arch/i386/mm/mmap.c:arch_pick_mmap_layout, and this function is called by 
the elf loader in fs/binfmt_elf.c:load_elf_binary, i.e. the decision which 
address space layout to use for the current wine process is already done long 
time before your personality syscall takes effect.
I hoped there was some ELF section magic to turn this off (like execshield), 
but there doesn't seem to be.
