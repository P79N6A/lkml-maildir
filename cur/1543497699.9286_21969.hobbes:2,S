I am not sure if anyone can answer me on this one...  I am maintaining a
device driver for a 9 track Magnetic tape (quit laughing...).  The system is
Linux (intel based).  The question I have is that in the Linux Drivers book
by O'Reilly (pg 136), there is some code on doing an interruptable delay
that looks like:
  current->timeout = j;
  current->state   = TASK_INTERRUPTABLE;
  schedule();
With the 2.0.36 and earlier kernels, the timeout field existed, with the
2.2.x kernel in RedHat 6.0, it does not.  I need to redo this code, and am
trying to find out how under the newest kernel.  What is the substitute
code for this?
