"There are only black cars, we don't make any other color. Noone has 
ordered a car with a different color cause we don't accept those orders. 
And since noone orders why add colors? Unnecessary cruft."
In essence, People don't run big boxes due to scalability issues, fixing 
those might get someone to install a 16-Way.
They sure as hell aren't gonna buy one and then wait around 3 years for 
Linux to support it.
