Yes. GFP_DMA allocates memory below 16Mbytes for ISA devices and that is
a physical wiring issue. For PCI devices you can allocate a lot more using
the pci_alloc_* and pci_map_* interface to allocate memory for PCI in a
CPU independant manner. It'll also then look after cache coherency issues
for you
