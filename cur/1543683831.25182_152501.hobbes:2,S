Tell me a distro that ships pristine www.kernel.org kernels o release
gcc's,
without any 'backported patch from xxx-1234 to correct PR1234'. What is
the difference between backporting a patch from 3.3.1-pre to 3.3, and
using 3.3.1-pre directly ? Ah, that you get less bug corrected.
And no, at least in my case, this is not a stable Mandrake, it is
Cooker,
the equivalent of RawHide. Latest stable shiped a kernel built with
3.2.3,
and current cooker builds kernels with 3.3.1. And bugs are discovered
and
fixed. What's bad ?
