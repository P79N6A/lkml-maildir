AFAIK, nobody else has reported this problem on any other board.  It
appears to be exclusive to the BP6.  I hold great respect for ASUS boards,
but they're quite a bit more expensive than the BP6 (especially the SMP

Perhaps the BP6 is more sensitive to power fluctuations than other boards
(perhaps poor voltage regulation?)
