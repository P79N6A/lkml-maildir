yeah, will try something like that too.
the thing is, core kernel folks have to resist such pressures 
_somewhat_.
Architecture maintainers will put pressure on us from two directions: if 
a particular generic feature only helps _another_ architecture, they 
find it a nuisance and want it to be gone as much as possible.
If a particular feature helps them, they want it supported and 
default-enabled as much as possible. In fact, complaints come if a 
generic-looking feature shows up in one architecture only. (recent 
example: inlining optimizations ;-)
And you are totally right about sched_clock() being dead on accurate an 
globally synchronous on sparc64 - and you are right to find _any_ issue 
about it a nuisance. I totally envy you that sparc64's sched_clock() is 
so simple - it should have been like that on x86 years ago, if hw 
designers werent so impotent about it.
( although please note that the growing generalization that goes on
  _did_ find a subtle nohz problem on sparc64 early in the merge window,
  so it's not like these changes are totally useless to you. )
but it all goes in the other direction as well: many folks find 
endianness problems a nuisance on x86, many folks find TLB and explicit 
cache coherence complications a nuisance on x86 as well. The bus-to-phys 
complication which is an identity on x86. Etc. etc.
But the core kernel is a conscious and intelligent union of all 
architecture's needs, and often we maintain complications even if they 
make no sense on the most popular platform. I think it makes strategic 
sense because it keep the kernel truly generic and truly clean. It also 
keeps architectures honest: even today the x86 architecture is still not 
as clean as sparc64 for example.
so please be patient, we are working on it :)
