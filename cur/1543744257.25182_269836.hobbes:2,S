Hi
I think that a new io-scheduler that gave priority to bursty access to
block devices would be interesting for desktop and workstation use, and
even for some servers.
I'm often waiting for graphical aplications, vim, mutt, and almost every
program to which I have to interact with because they are blocked
waiting for just a few blocks of IO that won't get served fast just
because there's a single process hog that's provoking that high latency.
In network terminology the disk just feel like a network interface without QoS, 
service time just goes up insanely with just one client in the queue.
Although much care should be taken in designing this algorithm to
prevent unfairness, I believe there's room for improvement in this area.
I'd like to read about your opinions.
Regards.
