afaik, __ALIGN has nothing to do with cache-line size.. L1_CACHE_BYTES.
(hmm.. am I out to lunch or should __ALIGN be set to 0 for pentia?)

That's done in specs:predefines.  __i386__ is always defined, and as
soon as you tell it which cpu you're using, (see cpp_cpu) cpp adds
to it's defines accordingly.
I don't see anything at all wrong with using __ix86__ because the
kernel isn't going to be compiled by anything other than gcc without
doing a truckload of rewriting.
