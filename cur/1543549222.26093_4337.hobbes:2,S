Sure, it is possible - that's how the write happens

s/pending write/obvious bug/, damnit. Daniel, just think for a second: we
have the buffer read to be picked by bdflush and written to disk, while
the _contents_ _is_ _not_ _uptodate_. Just what can you expect when write
succeeds? Junk on disk, right? You know, GIGO queue - garbage in, garbage
out...

Wrong. It's an instant BUG at line 711 in ll_rw_blk.c - remember these
reports?

Sure, the dirty bit is not orthogonal to the rest. You don't need to do
any complex analysis - it's as simple as
	* if I don't know _where_ to write the data - I'ld better not feed
the request to ll_rw_block(), or it may get PO'd
	* if I know that data is junk - I don't want it hitting the disk.
Dirty bit == request fed into the funnel and can be on disk any moment now.
Locked == already in IO subsystem.
That's it - completely independent from the rest, except that you don't
want the whole write mechanism applied to non-uptodate or non-mapped
pieces.
Think about IO as a memory bus - cache controller deals with writing the
cache line to RAM, but you don't want it to try that on lines that don't
have PA already calculated or have invalid contents. "mark dirty" == point
the write-behind mechanism to it and let it decide when the thing must be
written. Think how to make the cache indexed by virtual address (not by
physical, as in case of x86) work correctly. That's what pagecache is -
software MMU with cache-by-VA architecture.
