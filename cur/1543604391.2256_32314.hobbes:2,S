Yes... but.  The final test was using bzImage which became about 1k
shorter after making the changes to vmlinux.lds.

The size change of the raw image is even more evident:
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root      1548916 Oct  9 13:49 vmlinux
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root      1590692 Oct  1 13:26 vmlinux.OLD
I did not look at any other scripts that are involved in making
the image.
Also I was not complaining about anything. One respondent noted
that compiling the kernel with a new 'C' compiler resulted in
a large increase in kernel size. Some of us then attempted to
find out simple ways to get the kernel size back down. I showed
that some 'C' compiler versions have enormous ID strings that
are wasting space. I also mentioned that some versions align
everything on 16-byte boundaries and there doesn't seem to
be any way to turn off this 'feature'.
Cheers,

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
