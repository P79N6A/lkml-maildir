That would require that we increment current->something on every
spin/read/write_lock and decrement it in unlock, even with !CONFIG_PREEMPT.
iirc, Anton added an option to do that to the ppc64 build, decoupled from
CONFIG_PREEMPT (which ppc64 doesn't support).
But it's an appreciable amount of overhead.
