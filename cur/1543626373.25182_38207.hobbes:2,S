This is going to be RedHat distribution specific; it's not a Linux kernel /
networking question.  The RedHat boot scripts take care of module loading,
etc.

This too is a RedHat-specific question.  If you 'insmod 3c59x; ifconfig
eth0 1.2.3.4 ...' by hand, it should surely work.  The /etc/rc.d/init.d
contents on your system are all created / set up by RedHat.
You should check out the redhat-list list, subscribe info at:

We also have a searchable archive of it at:
