Oh yeah.. that's with libata controlling all drives in the system.
This exact same mobo was used for a while with a PATA DVD-RW (no ZIP drive)
under older kernels using drivers/IDE, but was unreliable in that configuration
(Ubuntu Edgy).   Ditto when the PATA DVD-RW was replaced with a SATA DVD-RW.
