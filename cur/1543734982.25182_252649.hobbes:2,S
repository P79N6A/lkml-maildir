Please cc me any replies.

I'm quite interested in this driver as well.  At the moment I'm stuck
using the ndiswrapper to make the card work but it's not how I would
like to do things long term.  I looked at the rtl8180+sa2400 driver at
sourceforge and it seems to be the most promising but the code is in
pretty bad shape.  It won't compile against a recent kernel using gcc
3.4 without a load of warnings and errors due to the coding style.  I
also found a project (forget where exactly) that is focused on making
the existing Realtek drivers work under 2.6 kernels.  The Realtek
drivers do the typical link-to-precompiled-object bit and are designed
for 2.4.  I haven't played with them myself so I don't know if they work
or not.  I would really prefer a standard, well-written fully open
driver (wouldn't we all!) that at worst requires a firmware binary to be
loaded.  The prism54 and ipw2x00 drivers come to mind...
