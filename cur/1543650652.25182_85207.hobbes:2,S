Bit 3 in 0x84 and 0x86 are those I'm most interested in. If the chip has
0x86 bit 3 cleared, try with having it set.
If that doesn't yield anything, you may want to monitor bytes 0x08, 0x09,
0x0c, 0x0d, 0x80, 0x81, 0x84 and 0x86. Just in case.

What spec? It seems okay with the one I have.

That bit is just the obvious candidate, there might be others. Here's
hoping that Rhine chips don't turn off the TxEngine without setting a flag
to inform the driver.
