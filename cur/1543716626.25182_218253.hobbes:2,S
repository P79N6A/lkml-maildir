Yes, but that should lead to a shutdown on both ends. If you
have sent a reset, why are you not tearing down your end of
whatever remains of the connection? You have asked the
other side to tear down. RFC 793:
"The receiver of a RST first validates it, then changes 
state.  If the receiver was in the LISTEN state, it ignores it.  
If the receiver was in SYN-RECEIVED state and had previously 
been in the LISTEN state, then the receiver returns to the 
LISTEN state, otherwise the receiver aborts the connection 
and goes to the CLOSED state.  If the receiver was in any 
other state, it aborts the connection and advises the user
and goes to the CLOSED state."

That will work.

Hmm, that sounds like a root cause issue, then (why the app wasn't
receiving data in the first place)..
Thanks for the info..
