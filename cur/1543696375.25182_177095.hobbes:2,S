Just write a simple misc device, where you implement read and write.
open -> control open behavior, setup file->private to point to your data
read -> reads from your FIFO one value at a time
write -> flush fifo (not needed?)
llseek -> no_llseek (since you are a fifo!)
poll -> waits for at least one entry in the fifo
release -> free your private data allocated for file->private
In read() you check whether *ppos != file->f_pos and return -ESPIPE in this
case.
You also check, whether size is the right size for your data and return
- -EINVAL, if not.
Implementing poll would be nice, if you want your script to deamonize,
but is not needed, if you trigger reading via init.
write ignores all arguments and simply flushes the FIFO.
If you allow multiple open by not returning -EBUSY on the second open,
you should take care of locking your FIFO.

/proc is only good for showing values, but not for FIFOs.

A misc character device is perfect.
BTW: Which kernel(s) do you target in your development?
