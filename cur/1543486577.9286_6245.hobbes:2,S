In my previous letter I remarked that the program
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <errno.h>
int main(){
        if(open("/dev/hdd", O_RDONLY) < 0) perror("hdd");
        if(open("/dev/hde", O_RDONLY) < 0) perror("hde");
        return 0;
}
outputs (on a machine with hdc and without hdd and hde):
hdd: Device not configured                 [ENXIO]
hde: Operation not supported by device     [ENODEV]
which looks a bit silly, and suggested that perhaps ide.c
should be adapted. But I changed my mind: the IDE driver is right
and it is devices.c that is wrong.
Look at the definitions of these errors:
ENODEV: An attempt was made to apply an inappropriate
	function to a device; for example, trying to
	read a write-only device such as a printer.
ENXIO: Input or output on a special file referred to a
	device that did not exist, or made a request
	beyond the limits of the device.
Clearly then, in devices.c:blkdev_open(), if someone refers to a major
that is unknown, we should return ENXIO.
