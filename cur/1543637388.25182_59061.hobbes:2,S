Because nobody pulls from Linus' tree so it is never locked.  He can push
to that and then it's up to yours truly to push it up and wait for locks.
It's actually a non-problem these days, it was a problem right after the
linux.bkbits.net trees went up because people were cloning them over modems
and they were locked forever.  Linus was already less than thrilled with
our locking approach and this was just too lame for him to deal with so
I set up the extra tree.  It could probably go away but since it works
and the point of BK wrt Linux was to offload Linus, I'm not going to go
yank his chain.
