+ * Some macro usage:
+ * - CFI macros are used to generate dwarf2 unwind information for better
+ * backtraces. They don't change any code.
+ * - SAVE_ALL/RESTORE_ALL - Save/restore all registers
+ * - SAVE_ARGS/RESTORE_ARGS - Save/restore registers that C functions modify.
+ * There are unfortunately lots of special cases where some registers
+ * not touched. The macro is a big mess that should be cleaned up.
+ * - SAVE_REST/RESTORE_REST - Handle the registers not saved by SAVE_ARGS.
+ * Gives a full stack frame.
+ * - ENTRY/END Define functions in the symbol table.
+ * - FIXUP_TOP_OF_STACK/RESTORE_TOP_OF_STACK - Fix up the hardware stack
+ * frame that is otherwise undefined after a SYSCALL
+ * - TRACE_IRQ_* - Trace hard interrupt state for lock debugging.
+ * - errorentry/paranoidentry/zeroentry - Define exception entry points.
