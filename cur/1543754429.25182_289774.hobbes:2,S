The changes, I purposed, shouldn't be too hard to implement. I will
build a skeleton for Michael, but I can't test the code, as I don't own
a padlock system, further, I'm sorry to say but, my time is somehow
constrained.. I really gotta start to write my diploma thesis, I'm
delaying this for too long for crypto stuff now.
But before I put that into the my queue, I would like to see some kind
of decision on an async crypto framework. acrypto cames with hardware
support. So, are we heading for hardware support in cryptoapi, hardware
support in acrypto, acrypto instead of cryptoapi, OCF instead of
cryptoapi, or put everything into the kernel and export 3 interface? 
And how - when there is more than one interface - are these projects
going to reuse code?
