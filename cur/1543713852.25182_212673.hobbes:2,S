But that's OK: that's a user race.  It's like reading a file at the same
time as writing it.

Yes, taking it in both syscalls would work, too.

Thanks.  BTW, can you take a look at the FIXME: in xics.c and change it
to be dynamic.  Joel is having trouble proving it's a problem, and yet
Anton assures me that ioremap is needed, so CPUs not present at boot
which are brought in should be failing...
Thanks!
Rusty.
