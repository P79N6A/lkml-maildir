I don't think this is true. The code was just running with the lock_kernel
held. And anyway avoiding /proc to play with the tsk->mm of the process
while another part of the kernel is just owning the mm semaphores is the
feature.

?? I don't understand. I simply mmput if I run mmget some time before.

I described it at 2.2.0 time.

It automagically fixes the FIXME that Tigran was thinking about
(read_lock/schedule issue). As second it avoids the task struct to go away
under us if wait4() is run in another CPU while we are in /proc.
In general my approch looks better to me beacuse it gives you a safe
interface to grab a task or an mm. Then you can sleep or do whatever you
want without releasing it. Once you have finished you'll only have to
release_mm(). This completly avoid all mistakes and any kind of future
bugs in array.c.
