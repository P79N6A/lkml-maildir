I don't see any reason why we cannot run percpu_counter_init() prior to
running percpu_counter_startup().  And it is desirable that we be able to
start using the percpu-counters quite early.
Can you debug it a bit please?  It's probably some silly little thing,
perhaps fixable by calling percpu_counter_startup() earlier.

It would be better to make the core infrastructure more robust, rather
than working around problems it might have.
It's rather nice that percpu_counters internally take care of
cpu-hotplugging, and use cpu_online_map.  I was amazed at how easily that
was added.  I still expect it to break somehow..
