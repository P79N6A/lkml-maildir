are you talking about making the userspace stack not executable or the
kernel stacks?
With NX, userspace stacks already are not executable (and if you have a
cpu without NX you can use the execshield patches or PaX)
As for kernel stacks, well, with NX those are not executable either, and
to be honest, I can't remember the last time there was a user
exploitable kernel stack buffer overflow. So if your assertion is that
those are a common type of security problem, I disagree with you.
(One of the underlying causes is that the kernel stack is only really
small so it's relatively uncommon and deprecated to put arrays on the
kernel stack)
