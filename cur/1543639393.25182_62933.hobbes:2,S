OK.  The kunmap_atomic() could happen on a different CPU, which will
die with CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM but apart from that, looks much saner.
We'll need need to manually fault in the user page on the
generic_file_read() path before taking the kmap, because reading
into an unmapped page is a common case: malloc/read.
Actually, p = malloc(lots); write(fd, p, lots); isn't totally
uncommon either, so the prefault on the write path would help
highmem machines (in which case it'd be best to leave it there
for all machines).

I don't understand what the pagetable walk is here for?
The kernel will sometimes need to read the page from disk to service
the fault, but it's locked...
We could drop the page lock before the __get_user, but that may
break the expectations of some filesystem's prepare/commit pair.
So I'm not clear on how we can lose the (racy, especially with
preemption) "one huge big hack".
The implicit use of preempt_count to mean "in kmap_copy_user" may
turn ugly.  But if so another tsk->flags bit can be created.   We'll
see...
