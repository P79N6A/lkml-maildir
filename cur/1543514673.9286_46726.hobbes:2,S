My laptop, an ARM TS3100 (Celeron 433) seems to do something like this.
Specifically, the system clock looses a lot of time, something like 10
minutes to the day.  I suspect that the system, when idle, automatically
underclocks for power/heat saving, thus somehow slowing down the system
time...  It's very annoying, since I have to constantly correct the system
time to my watch to get it to set correct timestamps and such.
