How many of these feature could be (at least partially) implemented in
the core code so that it was easier to port filesystems to use them.
Certainly versioning should be able to be implemented, possible without
any FS support at all, in the core code. Centralising the
implementations could allow a great deal of FS
custiomisation/improvements with very little new per FS code.
