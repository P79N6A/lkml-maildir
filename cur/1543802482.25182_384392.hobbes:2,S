Yes, that also works.
I think "quilt" is really the right thing here, although stg may be even 
easier due to the more direct git integration. But with a smallish number 
of patches, just doing patch management by hand is obviously simply not a 
huge problem either, so extra tools may just end up confusing the issue.
