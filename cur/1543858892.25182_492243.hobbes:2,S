Do you need these fixes to avoid a compiler error? If yes, this is
caused by a bug in gcc-4.x. The kmemleak container_of macro has
protection for non-constant offsets passed to container_of but the
faulty gcc always returns true for builtin_contant_p, even when this
is not the case. Previous versions (3.4) or one of the latest 4.x gcc
don't have this bug.
I wouldn't extend kmemleak to work around a gcc bug which was already fixed.

I test kmemleak with lockdep enabled but I eliminated all the
dependencies on the vanilla kernel. When kfree(hnode) is called (in
hash_delete), no kmemleak locks are held and hence no dependency on
the kmemleak locks (since kmemleak is protected against re-entrance).
My understanding is that slab __cache_free is re-entrant anyway
(noticed this when using radix-tree instead of hash in kmemleak and
got some lockdep reports on l3->list_lock and memleak_lock) and
calling it again from kmemleak doesn't seem to have any problem on the
vanilla kernel.
In the -rt kernel, is there any protection against a re-entrant
__cache_free (via cache_flusharray -> free_block -> slab_destroy) or
this is not needed?

It would indeed be better to avoid using the slab infrastructure (and
not worry about kmemleak re-entrance and lock dependecies). I'll have
a look on how this is done in lockdep since the preallocation size
isn't known. There are also the memleak_object structures that need to
be allocated/freed. To avoid any locking dependencies, I ended up
delaying the memleak_object structures freeing in an RCU manner. It
might work if I do the same with the hash nodes.

I had some reasons and couldn't find a unified solution, but probably
only for one or two if them:

For my limited configurations (an x86 laptop and several ARM embedded
platforms), 16 bits were enough. I'm not sure this is enough on a
server machine for example.
>  CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMLEAK_TRACE_LENGTH=4
I thought this is a user preference. I could hard-code it to 16.
What's the trace length used by lockdep?
>  CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMLEAK_PREINIT_OBJECTS=512
I can probably hard-code this as well. This is a buffer to temporary
store memory allocations before kmemleak is fully initialised.
Kmemleak gets initialised quite early in the start_kernel function and
shouldn't be that different in other kernel configurations.
>  CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMLEAK_SECONDARY_ALIASES=y
>  CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMLEAK_TASK_STACKS=y
These could be eliminated as well.
There are also:
CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMLEAK_REPORT_THLD - can be removed
CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMLEAK_REPORTS_NR - can be removed
CONFIG_DEBUG_KEEP_INIT - this might be useful for other tools that
store the backtrace and display it at a later time. Could be made more
generic.

I just followed the DEBUG_SLAB_LEAK configuration but I don't have any
problem with making it more visible.
Thanks for your comments.
