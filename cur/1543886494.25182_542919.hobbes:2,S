Hmmmm... This is redoing what the vm counters already provide
Could you add
NR_MOVABLE_PAGES etc.
instead and then let the ZVC counter logic take care of the rest?
With a ZVC you will have the numbers in each zone and also in 
/proc/vmstat.
(Additional ulterior motive: If we ever get away from ZONE_MOVABLE and 
make movable a portion of each zone then this will still work)
