Subject: building a specific in-tree module is currently a bit broken

  i know sam ravnborg has been Cc'ed on a janitors list posting
mentioning this but, just in case this note can get a fix snuck in
there quickly before 2.6.23 (this is on i386, but i'm guessing applies
to all arches):
$ make distclean
$ make defconfig
$ make menuconfig      (select visor.ko to be built a module)
$ make drivers/usb/serial/visor.ko
scripts/kconfig/conf -s arch/i386/Kconfig
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  UPD     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/utsrelease.h
  UPD     include/linux/utsrelease.h
  SYMLINK include/asm -> include/asm-i386
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s
  GEN     include/asm-i386/asm-offsets.h
  CALL    scripts/checksyscalls.sh
  CC      scripts/mod/empty.o
  HOSTCC  scripts/mod/mk_elfconfig
  MKELF   scripts/mod/elfconfig.h
  HOSTCC  scripts/mod/file2alias.o
  HOSTCC  scripts/mod/modpost.o
  HOSTCC  scripts/mod/sumversion.o
  HOSTLD  scripts/mod/modpost
  HOSTCC  scripts/kallsyms
  HOSTCC  scripts/conmakehash
  HOSTCC  scripts/bin2c
  CC [M]  drivers/usb/serial/visor.o
/bin/sh: .tmp_versions/visor.mod: No such file or directory
  MODPOST 0 modules
$
  whoops.  manually creating the directory .tmp_versions first fixes
this, but i'm not conversant enough with the Makefile to want to take
a shot at repairing this.
