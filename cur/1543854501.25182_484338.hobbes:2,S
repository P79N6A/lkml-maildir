What I would like is for the mii core to maintain the bits (like advertising)
in the mii structure and if not running, it should just change the offline
copy, then when link is brought up use the changes that were requested while
link was down. Understand?
That's why in the skge/sky2, I keep state bits and don't apply them until
link is started. If mii (and phylib) did this, I could use them; but as it
is they require PHY to be powered all the time.
