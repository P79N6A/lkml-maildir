Shock!  1997 patch no longer applies cleanly in 2006!  Alert the media!
Seriously though, this is exactly why I think Linux should start accepting
patches from crazy people without question or review.   It's much easier to
deal with whatever cruft is applied by the patch than it is to endure the 
multi year manic tirades of such individuals who have their egos bruised as
a result of rejection.
