It's not experimental on other architectures, where it is always used.
The best option _may_ be to do something like this, where we use that 
"depends on" to set the expectations, and people shouldn't see it unless 
they ask for EXPERIMENTAL.
It also refuses to turn on for SPARC64, since that seems to be known 
broken. Or should it be just "SPARC"? Davem?
