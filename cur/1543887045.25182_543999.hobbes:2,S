Well, for the current -git we have:
rafael@albercik:~/src/linux-2.6> grep -r -I -l try_to_freeze * \
	| grep -v signal.c | grep -v freezer.h | grep -v process.c | wc
     45      45    1186
Most of these are calls from kernel threads.
At the same time we have:
rafael@albercik:~/src/linux-2.6> grep -r -I -l PF_NOFREEZE * \
	| grep -v sched.h | grep -v process.c | grep -v freezer.h | wc
     23      23     559
I wouldn't call that a majority.  Moreover:
rafael@albercik:~/src/linux-2.6> grep -r -I -l PF_NOFREEZE drivers/* | wc
      9       9     238
rafael@albercik:~/src/linux-2.6> grep -r -I -l try_to_freeze drivers/* | wc
     27      27     790
That, BTW, is why I was (and I still am) afraid to stop freezing kernel threads
just like that.
Of course it's possible to look at these 45 files and see if the kernel threads
in there really need to be freezable and I'm going to do this, but this is a
different thing.
Besides, the problems with interdependencies that we've had recently are
related specifically to the CPU hotplug.  To be precise, they are related to the
CPU hotplug notifiers that try to stop kernel threads which may be frozen.
The other interdependencies don't lead to freezer-related problems.
Greetings,
Rafael
