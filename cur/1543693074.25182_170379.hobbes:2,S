Certain devices will then generate an endless stream of zero-movement
relative events, which is not good.
Because 'relative' means that there is no movement when there is no
event, where exactly lies the problem? What application has a problem
with this? Many mice don't ever report zero values, so that application
will probably not work even without the (value==0) check ...
