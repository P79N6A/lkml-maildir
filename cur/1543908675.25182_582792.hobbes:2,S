Your connection can break at any point even mid-write so you must handle
it. You have no real choice.
You can try and spot it earlier by using select/poll and checking for
error. In which case I'd use poll() as it is a bit more clear about what
event you get
Then poll stdin and stdout. The kernel will give you back 
POLLERR - an error condition
POLLHUP - a hangup
if at the point you poll an error has already occurred. You can do this
with select and the socket error and related stuff buts its uglier
