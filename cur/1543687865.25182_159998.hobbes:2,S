True.  However if you generate lots of 64-bit values and see a
collision between any two, that is much more likely.  See "birthday paradox".
I know you understand this, David.  Just so everyone else is clear,
because part of this thread is about locking problems (same result
within a short time), and part of this thread is about uniqueness
(collisions between any pair).
Enjoy,
