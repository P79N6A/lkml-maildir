I've had DIMMs not get along. So have other people. This little 
tester seems to find that fairly well, stunningly --- even when 
Memtest86 can't find them at all. It found mine in about 30min 
(512mb box); another persons in an hour or two.
Adjust the defines up top.
PS: You did report the failure to the memtest86 people, right?
