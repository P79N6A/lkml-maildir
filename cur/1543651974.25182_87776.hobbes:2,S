Dear diary, on Thu, Nov 07, 2002 at 02:22:45PM CET, I got a letter,
where Peter Samuelson <peter@cadcamlab.org> told me, that...

I'm a bit lost here - the kernel uses tons of gcc extensions - how is another
compiler supposed to understand them? And if it is specifically extended to
understand them, isn't it likely that it'll understand the -shared switch in
gcc-like way as well?
Or better, what other compiler is known to build a kernel than gcc? At least
anything that doesn't define __GNUC__ should IMHO fail inside of init/main.c.
And how likely is situation when someone want to configure a kernel with
non-gcc compiler and actually build it with gcc?
I thought that the point of HOSTCC is to allow to use a non-standart version
of gcc for kernel build.
