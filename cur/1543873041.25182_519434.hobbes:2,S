This doesn't work, and so CONFIG_QUICKLIST is always set. The NR_QUICK
thing seems a bit backwards anyways, perhaps it would make more sense to
have architectures set CONFIG_GENERIC_QUICKLIST in the same way that the
other GENERIC_xxx bits are defined, and then set NR_QUICK based off of
that. It's obviously going to be 2 or 1 for most people, and x86 seems to
be the only one that needs 2.
How about this?
