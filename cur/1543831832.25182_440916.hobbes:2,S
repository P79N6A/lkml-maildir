You don't delete a file but a filename, and that's what your system will
still do.

Depending on unlinked file to be inaccessible and never have been copied
just because you called unlink is the real security hole.

And the salvaging fs will do exactly this whenever you unlink() the final
reference. You could also use a userspace library catching each unlink call,
but it would also have to intercept each write() call for each user and
try to reclaim the backup copies on disk-full and would-have-to-fragment
events. Off cause there are no userspace-visible would-have-to-fragment
events, so besides being ugly a userspace solution would not be able to
completely provide the same service.

It's just a marginal shift. If you can't trust yourself, you've lost. If
you can't trust the current root, you're screwed, too. If you can't trust
a future root, the time window in which the file can be recovered will
slightly increase and the needed knowledge will be reduced. Otherwise, there
is no change.
