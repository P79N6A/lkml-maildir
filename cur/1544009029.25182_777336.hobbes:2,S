Well, the if clauses are different anyway, but no matter.

I agree with your philosophy, although I was merely letting it go back to
the way it was - which I thought was safer then introducing new behaviour
into an undefined situation.

Subject: [PATCH] mmc_block: ensure all sectors that do not have errors are read
If a card encounters an ECC error while reading a sector it will
timeout.  Instead of reporting the entire I/O request as having
an error, redo the I/O one sector at a time so that all readable
sectors are provided to the upper layers.
