In most cases however, issuing ctrl+c signals make and make will
remove the output file.
Problematic indeed, "temp" could be left when ctrl+c is hit:
foo: bar
	generate-something <bar >temp;
	add-up <temp >foo;
What could work, temp being removed on ^C:
temp: bar
	generate-something <bar >temp;
foo: temp
	add-up <temp >foo;
