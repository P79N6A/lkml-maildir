I agree is is not a big issue in this case - my interpretation of tails 
was the end
of any file could be packed, but if it is only small files.....

They are invalidated at the start of the I/O, but page faults are not 
blocked
out for the duration of the I/O, so the coherency is weak. However, if an
application is doing a combination of mmapped and direct I/O to a file
at the same time, then it should generally have some form of user space
synchronization anyway. For an application doing its own synchronization
of different I/Os they are coherent.
