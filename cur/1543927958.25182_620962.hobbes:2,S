Give people right hints and tools and they will work miracles. ;-)
If user reports hard lockup propably the first thing to ask will be
to try NMI watchdog etc.  We have this kind of information spreaded
through various files in Documentation/ (and also other sources).
What we right now we have in bugzilla is:
"
Some basic debugging hints
    * Diagnosing OOM conditions
    * Debugging kernel hangs
    * Setting up a serial console
"
[ at 
http://test.kernel.org/bugzilla/faq.html
 ]
and all entries end up with "This page does not exist yet. You can create
a new empty page, or use one of the page templates. Before creating the
page, please check if a similar page already exists."

To speedup a process.

Sure there is something wrong on our side as we don't store this kind of
information in organized way currently.

If you are lucky the right information will be there and it will save both
reporter and the developer one "communication cycle".

Fully agreed.
I rather meant that the we can make the process work better for both sides.

Technically it is not a problem at all, i.e. you can sign mail with GPG etc.

Duplicating efforts is not good thing (wasted time).

Well, I hope that we can use some help from distro people here
(many distros have bugzillas superior to our).
