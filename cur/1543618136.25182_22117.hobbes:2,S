Hi!
It has nothing to do with nvidia. I think. I'm using redhat now, but
once I've tried a network installation with suse, and yast crashed at
the beginning. I have played with the boot parameters, and mem=nopentium
was the winner:). I have bought my machine in december, 1999, it's an
athlon 500, so in former athlons the bug exists somehow. The nvidia
module makes crash with the stock kernel irongate agp driver, but not
with the nv agp driver for me, but it's offtopic.
