Another suggestion about naming:
Take for example drivers/net:
cat Config.* | wc => 2149 lines
A bit a structure could be needed here.
Net.conf  <= Name equals directory with upper-case first letter
	- Cover the whole directory, and either implicit
	  or explicit include other .conf files in that directory
3c5xx.conf <= All the configuration for the 3c5xxx chipset drivers
rrunner.conf <= All configuration for rrunner driver
So letting the naming convention be directory name with upper-case start
letter - as the entry to a directory.
Additional configuration in sensibly named configuration files.
I do not see the split of configuration happen before 2.6, except in 
some special cases though. But I wanted to let the naming convention
support that.
source statements could look like:
source driver/net  <= since Net.conf is implicit
But I would prefer the files spelled out.

Keep both versions please. It's much easier just to apply a patch,
but I see why Linus ask for the other solution.
I know what version has preference ;-)
