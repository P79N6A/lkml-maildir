I have come to agree with this sentiment.  However I do have a small
issue with the current bootimg api.  Everything is done in page sized
chunks.  Which feels like it is exporting too much of the current
implementation.
struct boot_image {
	void **image_map;	/* pointers to image pages in user memory */
	int pages;		/* length in pages */
	unsigned long *load_map;/* list of destination pages (physical addr) */
	unsigned long start;	/* jump to this physical address */
	int flags;		/* for future use, must be zero for now */
};
asmlinkage int sys_bootimg(struct boot_image *user_dsc)
My preference goes to something like:
struct segment {
        void *vaddr;		/* virtual address of the data to start with */
        unsigned long paddr;	/* physical address to copy this segment to */
        unsigned long size;	/* size in bytes of this segment */
};
asmlinkage int sys_kexec(struct segment *segments, int nr_segments, unsigned long start_addr);
The big difference I believe is that you will have far fewer segments,
in my scheme, and where everything is on a byte granularity the user
space implementation doesn't have to know how the kernel side of
the implementation interacts with pages.
I hadn't realized until just a minute ago when I looked again that you
were exporting pages.

Except for the case of Loadlin where the old firmware is destroyed,
and you cannot requery the firmware.  You have a more robust solution
if you let the new kernel query the firmware itself.  In general it is
not safe to use firmware device drivers, but otherwise you are o.k.

For the most part I agree, that the bootimg type interface will avoid
bloat.  At the same time, some of this information that we would like
to pass is easier to get at in kernel space, oh well.

Possibly.

I will stop just a moment to say it is extremely nasty to read the ELF
section header instead of the ELF program header for boot purposes.
For an ELF static executable it is totally valid not to have a section
header.

Actually a library of functions to do the conversions sounds very
reasonable.

I actually pretty much agree.  But mostly because it becomes easier to
do a clean shutdown.  If you just wrote a file it is kind of hard to
have a read-only filesystem, plus it looks like it will reduce the
strife a little bit...
