In 2.4.14 linux leave pages in swap when swaping in.  This is a win when
the page has not been changed and there is memory pressure.  This behavior
is maintained until swap is 50% full.  An this point linux starts releasing
swap pages at swapin.
In short linux keeps pages in swap and memory to perform better but starts
releasing swap pages when swap start filling.
