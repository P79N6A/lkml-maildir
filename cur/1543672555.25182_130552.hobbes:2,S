Sorry, I wasn't aware about this POSIX rule, thank you for pointing out
this. Knowing that it would obviously be better providing support of the
constant _SC_DELAYTIMER_MAX for sysconf() and return a value. 
This would imply there is now some job for glibc. However it's still
unclear for me how the glibc would know about wich value it should 
return while this question would be so easy to answer for the kernel!
Also AFAIK, right now, only the NPTL supports the new syscalls for the
timers (and none supports the clocks syscalls). Does it mean a special
__sysconf() is necessary in the NPTL? Well, probably that's why you 
suggested -1 as a return value I guess :-)

You are right also here, of course with this point of view it's
better not putting any constant.
So the patch could become something like that: ?
