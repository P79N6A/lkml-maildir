schedule( ) always runs in kernel space, therefore  the address of all
elements used by schedule() is not virtual address but physical
address.?
analogous question also appears in system call , when I define myself
syscall , for example:
asmlinkage long sys_check(a,b ,c){
 
        unsigned long buf;
 
        ...........
}
 
then , the buf is stored in kernel space , that is , physical address .
 
 
right or wrong
