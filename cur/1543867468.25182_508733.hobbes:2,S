Which is why an audit is irrelevant for the most part.  Note on the

???  I fail to see the code bloat and also the fast paths.  Which fast 
paths use udelay?

This is not to stop performance from sucking.  It doesn't.  This is not 
an "approach".  Sure, a virtual block driver won't be using udelay.  
Everyone else who writes hypervisors writes virtual block drivers 
because they don't have optimized I/O emulation for real hardware.  
Their performance sucks without it because they have to go switch to 
some other context and run a device emulator.  Our doesn't.  We have 
optimized almost every I/O device we emulate.  But sitting around 
spinning in udelay is wasting everybody's time.  There is an overhead 
cost to trapping out on I/O instructions.  Removing the udelays that 
typically happen around I/O instructions causes the emulation to break even.
And that is a good thing.  It's certainly not required, nor is it a 
significant win while the kernel is running.  It does cut the boot time 
by a lot, and you will notice an obvious difference with a much faster 
kernel boot simply because a lot of the hardware setup has very 
conservative udelays which take a lot of time during device 
initialization.  Since boot time * number of reboots has a direct impact 
on the number of 9's you can claim for uptime, this is actually a large 
win for reliability.
