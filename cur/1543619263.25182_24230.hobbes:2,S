The resolution is in microseconds. That's the specification. Not
all 'codes' are exercised of course, but the resolution is sufficient
to discern a 10 to 30 microsecond difference. I'm trying to measure
milliseconds, well within its capability. FYI, this is what `ping`
and `traceroute` use. It's fine.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
