Could this be made generic for all network drivers?
I'm thinking:
  1. Interrupt comes in
  2. Kernel disables interrupt
  3. Driver fetches/sends data.
  4. Driver loops back to 3 if there's more data
     (many drivers do this already).
  5. Driver returns.
  ... timer driven delay ...
  6. Kernel reenables interrupt.
  7. If interrupt pending, go to 2.
The current situtation is very similar -- the only difference being that
currently there is no delay between 5 and 6.  Based on user-space
polling work done by someone else here, I suspect introducing a delay
when under load, using the timer interrupt (sped up to 1-10kHz) would
significantly improve overall throughput.
(It costs latency and possibly loses packets if you get sudden loading,
which is why we'd only want to do it under load).

One would hope this could be done by magic in the kernel ;-)
