I agree.  Although the X servers CPU usage is usually relatively low 
(less than 5%) it does have periods when it can get quite high (greater 
than 80%) for reasonably long periods.  This makes it difficult to come 
up with a set of rules for CPU allocation that makes sure the X server 
gets what it needs (when it needs it) without running the risk of giving 
other tasks with similar load patterns unnecessary and unintentional 
preferential treatment.
However, I think that there is still a need for automatic boosts for 
some tasks.  For instance, programs such as xmms and other media 
streamers are ones whose performance could worsen as a result of the X 
server being reniced unless it is treated specially and the boost they 
are given needs to be enough to put them before the X server in priority 
order.  But renicing X would enable a tightening of the rules that 
govern the automatic dispensing of preferential treatment to tasks that 
are perceived to be interactive which should be good for overall system 
performance.
