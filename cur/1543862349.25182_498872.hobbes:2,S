The thought that crossed my mind was:
Why not do the same thing that was done to the "Help"-file. (Before it
was superseded by Kconfig).
Originaly there was a central Help-file, with all the texts. Then it was
split and placed in each sub-dir. And later it was superseded by Kconfig.
On the other hand you could skip the intermediate step and just fold the
Maintainer-data directly into Kconfig, that way everything is "in one
place" and you could place a "Maintainers"-Button next to the
"Help"-Button in *config, or just display it alongside the help.
And MAYBE that would also lessen the "update-to-date"-problem, as you
can just write the MAINTAINERs-data when you create/update the
Kconfig-file. Which is a thing that creates much bigger pain when you
forget it accidently. ;-)
Oh, and it neadly solves the mapping-problem, for at least all
kernel-parts that have a Kconfig-option/Sub-Tree.

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated,
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
