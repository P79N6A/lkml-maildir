IMHO:
file system APIs are not good for accessing attributed data.
e.g. we have a /proc which is very convenient for use from shell etc. but
is not good for applications, not fast enough etc.
moreover, /proc had always problems with locking, races and people tend to
feel like they can change text presention of data, while applications parsing
it tend to break.
