I've now tried running the following configurations
-both, with dual channel enabled @ 400
-both, with dual channel disabled @ 400
-both, with dual channel enabled @ 356
-both, with dual channel disabled @ 356
-both, with dual channel enabled @ 333
-both, with dual channel disabled @ 333
-one 400 @ 333 (A), with another module at @ 333 with dual channel disabled
-one 400 @ 333 (A), with another module at @ 333 with dual channel enabled
-one 400 @ 333 (B), with another module at @ 333 with dual channel disabled
-one 400 @ 333 (B), with another module at @ 333 with dual channel enabled
-two complete different modules, both DDR 333 @ 333 with dual channel
enabled
-two complete different modules, both DDR 333 @ 333 with dual channel
disabled
:::all of which are 512 MB each, and that the motherboard was tested to
support:::
and all of them have the same problem: black screen after kernel loads
they all do seem to test with errors when ran with another module, but they
also DO NOT test as errors when they're alone
I'm starting to think it's a problem with my motherboard rather than with
the RAM, because I've tried so many different ways and with different RAM
modules.. but I don't know for sure.. basically every time I try to run any
linux distribution, even if I type (mem=XXXM), it just doesn't work... I can
run some other operating systems without problems, but I know that e.g.
windows is less stressful etc.
hmm
