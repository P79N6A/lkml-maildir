It is a very complicated process. The script plus the files it uses
take about 700MB.

Very possible.

My script does have VERY FAST dirtify/umount/mount/dirtify sequences.

I have run many tests. The results are
1. 2.2.5 is ok.
2. 2.2.6 has the bug. buffer.c was not changed between 2.2.5 and 2.2.6.
3. 2.2.5 + some rename patch from 2.2.6 has the bug.
4. 2.2.5 + your rename-patch-11, which I believe is similar to the
rename patch from 2.2.6, has the bug.
Everything points to the rename change in 2.2.6. It may not be
the real cause of the bug. But at least it causes the bug to show up.
Thanks.
