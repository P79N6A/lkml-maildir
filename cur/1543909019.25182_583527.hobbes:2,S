good question, I suspect that some of the error handling would be similar 
(for devices that are unreachable not haning the system for example), but 
a lot of the rest would be different (do you really want to try to 
auto-resync to a drive that you _think_ just reappeared, what if it's a 
different drive? how can you be sure?) the error rate of a network is gong 
to be significantly higher then for USB or SATA drives (although I suppose 
iscsi would be limilar)
