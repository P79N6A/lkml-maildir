Well, yes. That would probably be the better way to go about it, though
I have to admit I was somewhat pleased with myself that I came up with
something that worked. :)
Your patches work well, with a few minor notes:
1: My Inspiron 9200 (and perhaps others) doesn't seem to respond to the
I8K_SMM_BIOS_VERSION function call, so it fails the check in i8k_probe.
~ The check of i8k_get_bios_version doesn't seem critical, and removing
the return -ENODEV makes it work again for me.  That's the current
behavior, so perhaps the printk level should just be changed to
KERN_WARNING rather than KERN_ALERT.
2: To compile 2.6.11 cleanly, I needed two hunks from your original
patch 2 (perhaps you're working from a more up-to-date tree than I am?
If so, these are probably already addressed.):

I also have a question about the structure created using sysfs attribute
arrays.  Applying it in this case, I get:
./temp
./temp/3
./temp/2
./temp/1
./temp/0
./fan_speed
./fan_speed/1
./fan_speed/0
./fan_state
./fan_state/1
./fan_state/0
The 'temp' entries make sense, however I'm not sure about the fan_speed
and fan_state entries.  From the perspective of how the objects are
ordered, a fan would have 'speed' and 'state' attributes, but a
'fan_state' attribute wouldn't normally have a fan.  Maybe something
along these lines would make more sense from that perspective:
./fan/0
./fan/0/speed
./fan/0/state
./fan/1
./fan/1/speed
./fan/1/state
I'm not certain about the best way to do this, so this may just be a
thought.  It would certainly be more complex to reorder it, and it
appears usable in its current form.
