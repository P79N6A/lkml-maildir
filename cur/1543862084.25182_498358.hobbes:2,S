hi All,
Please could you cc me because I'm not subscribed.
is there a way, other than rebooting, to clean up /proc/swaps ?
I'm in this situation (due to testing errors),
# cat /proc/swaps
Filename                                Type            Size    Used    Priority
/dev/sdc1                               partition       2040064 0       -1
/tmp/swaH4mvTI/swapfilenext\040(deleted) file           48960   0       -31
