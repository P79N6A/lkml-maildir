No. This is why:
lookup_dentry() uses this code to calculate the hash value:
                hash = init_name_hash();
                do {
                        name++;
                        hash = partial_name_hash(c, hash);
                        c = *(const unsigned char *)name;
                } while (c && (c != '/'));
                this.len = name - (const char *) this.name;
                this.hash = end_name_hash(hash);
Later on, it uses this.hash to call cached_lookup():
                /* This does the actual lookups.. */
                dentry = reserved_lookup(base, &this);
                if (!dentry) {
                        dentry = cached_lookup(base, &this);
                        if (!dentry) {
                                dentry = real_lookup(base, &this);
                                if (IS_ERR(dentry))
                                        break;
                        }
                }
cached_lookup() uses d_lookup() to lookup a dentry in the cache:
static struct dentry * cached_lookup(struct dentry * parent, struct qstr * name)
{
        struct dentry * dentry = d_lookup(parent, name);
        if (dentry && dentry->d_op && dentry->d_op->d_revalidate) {
                if (!dentry->d_op->d_revalidate(dentry) && !d_invalidate(dentry)) {
                        dput(dentry);
                        dentry = NULL;
                }
        }
        return dentry;
}
d_lookup() uses d_hash() to get the list_head of the external linking
of the hash table:
struct dentry * d_lookup(struct dentry * parent, struct qstr * name)
{
        unsigned int len = name->len;
        unsigned int hash = name->hash;
        const unsigned char *str = name->name;
        struct list_head *head = d_hash(parent,hash);
        struct list_head *tmp = head->next;
d_hash() uses the hash value to get a pointer into the dentry_hashtable:
static inline struct list_head * d_hash(struct dentry * parent, unsigned long ha
sh)
{
        hash += (unsigned long) parent;
        hash = hash ^ (hash >> D_HASHBITS) ^ (hash >> D_HASHBITS*2);
        return dentry_hashtable + (hash & D_HASHMASK);
}
If the hash value is different from that produced by full_name_hash(),
it will get the wrong link chain, and it will never find the entry
that was put there by using full_name_hash().
