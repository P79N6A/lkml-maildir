True enough, but the general trend is that increasing swapping decreases data 
rate.  This is even more true for the real applications that we are modelling 
with this simple benchmark.  In thosec cases, the user has a lot of mapped 
data that they then write out using buffered I/O.  If the mapped data gets 
swapped out, then it may have to be swapped back in to be written out to the 
file system.  It would be faster to keep the mapped data from being swapped 
out at all provided that there is enough page cache space to keep the devices 
running at full speed.
(And yes, we've suggested that they mmap() the data files -- but sometimes 
this is an ISV's code that it causing the problem and we can't necessarily get 
them to update their codes to use the API's we want.)
