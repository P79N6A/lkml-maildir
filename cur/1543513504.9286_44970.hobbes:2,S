In August you rejected all of the then-current updates because they had
visible support for multiple kernel-support.  You wanted all backwards
compatibility code removed.  Based on that I spent several weeks changing and
testing over a dozen PCI drivers so that the base versions had support for
2.3 only.  Now those are changes are rejected.
I spend more than half of my working time working on Linux drivers,
including the time consuming, boring work of answering email and tracking
down usually-spurious bug reports.  I've done it in a way that minimizes the
your workload, and makes the updates and new drivers immediately available
to those with stable kernels.  And now I find out that you don't consider
me to be involved with the Linux kernel work.  (Well, at least that explains
my status with the RedHat IPO.)
