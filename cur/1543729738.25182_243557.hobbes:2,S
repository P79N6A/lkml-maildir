Agreed.  Maybe he thinks those of us who speak english still need that 
long to deciher what he thinks is english but in reality reminds me 
of engrish.com, just a different language for a starting point.  I 
can get the meaning in 3 seconds, but to fully read it, and translate 
it into real english takes all of that 15 seconds.  Sigh.
