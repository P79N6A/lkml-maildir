sure. Basically this macro tests whether a given schedulable entity is
task or not. Other possible schedulable entities could be process, user,
container etc. These various entities form a hierarchy with task being
at the bottom of the hierarchy.

I don't have a good opinion on this. Would it make sparse friendly?

'se' perhaps as is used elsewhere. I avoided making that change so that
people will see less diff o/p in the patch :) I agree though a better
name is needed.

I prefer its current name, but will consider your suggestion in next
iteration.

Couple of cases that we need to consider here:
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED disabled:
	lrq_curr() essentially returns NULL if currently running task
	doesnt belong to fair_sched_class, else it returns &rq->curr->se
	So the check for fair_sched_class is taken care in that
	function.
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED enabled:
	lrq_curr() returns lrq->curr. I introduced ->curr field in lrq
	to optimize on not having to update lrq's fair_clock
	(update_curr upon enqueue/dequeue task) if it was not currently 
	"active".
	Lets say that there are two groups 'vatsa' and 'guest'
	with their own lrqs on each cpu. If CPU0 is currently running a
	task from group 'vatsa', then lrq_vatsa->curr will point to
	the currently running task, while lrq_guest->curr will be 
	NULL. While the task from 'vatsa' is running, if we were to
	enqueue/dequeue task from group 'guest', we need not 
	update lrq_guest's fair_clock (as it is not active currently).
	This optimization in update_curr is made possible by maintaining
	a 'curr' field in lrq.
Hope this answers your question.
