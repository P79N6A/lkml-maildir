Let's see, I have 30 network daemons that are all sleeping, each
requested and got 200 MB of memory to work with. I've got 10 NFS
daemons that allocated their worse-case 228 MB data-buffers. They
are all sleeping. I have 6 gettys, sleeping on terminals, they
all requested and got 32 MB. I am now trying to log-in, but
/bin/login fails to exec because there is no memory.
What should have happened is each of the tasks need only about
4k until they actually access something. Since they can't possibly
access everything at once, we need to fault in pages as needed,
not all at once. This is what 'overcomit' is, and it is necessary.
If the machine was set up with the correct amount of swap, and
if resource limits are correctly in-place, even a 16 megabyte RAM
machine will not fail due to OOM.
If you have 'fixed' something so that no RAM ever has to be paged
you have a badly broken system.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
