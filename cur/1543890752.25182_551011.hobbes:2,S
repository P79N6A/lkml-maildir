Well, OK, but there's lots of things gcc could warn about.  How about
	while (1) { ...
By your argument gcc should warn that '1' always evaluates to true.
Or how about
#if 0
why shouldn't the preprocessor warn that the conditional is always false?

OK, but suppose I looked at it and there's no bug.  Leaving the
warning has a cost too: it hides useful warnings (that might be
showing real bugs) in all the clutter.
