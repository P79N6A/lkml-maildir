   Either that or adjust how we do atomic operations.  I can do 64-bit
   atomic widgetry, but not with the code as written.
Ultra can do it as well, and as far as I understand it ia64 64-bit
atomic_t's shouldn't be a problem either.
I would suggest we make a atomic64_t or similar different type.
The space savings from using 32-bit normal atomic_t in all other
situations is of real value.
