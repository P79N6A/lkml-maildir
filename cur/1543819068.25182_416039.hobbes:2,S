Hi group,
  Is there a way to determine which device I have booted from?  For example,
say I booted from a USB device, can I tell which one?  I did not find
anything in /proc FS other than the cmdline options.
  Please respond directly to MrUmunhum@popdial.com as I am not subscribed
to this mailing list.
  Thanks for your time.
