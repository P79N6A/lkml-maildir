Right now the list is the following:
static struct device_fixup fixups_table[] = {
{ PCI_VENDOR_ID_CYRIX, PCI_DEVICE_ID_CYRIX_5530_LEGACY,
cs5530a_warm_reset },
{ PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMD, PCI_DEVICE_ID_AMD_CS5536_ISA, cs5536_warm_reset },
};
Though, if the approach is not suitable, we can skip fixups if we came
from sysrq.
