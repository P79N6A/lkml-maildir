Why should there be?  The u32 value gets promoted to u64 before the
comparison is done.

I see you have a background in environments where you move between 16-
and 32-bit machines.  Guess what, in Linux the major movement is
between 32- and 64-bit machines, and "unsigned int" is consistent,
whereas "unsigned long" isn't (long is 32 bits on 32-bit machines, 64
bits on 64-bit machines.)
