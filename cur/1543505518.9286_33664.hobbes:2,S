This is _way_ off topic for linux-kernel, but... look at junkbuster (at
http://www.junkbusters.com
).  
One of the many cool things it can do is send a different User-agent
string, which I'm guessing is where they get your OS information.
For whatever reason, junkbuster will identify you as a Mac user by
default: "Mozilla/3.01Gold (Macintosh; I; 68K)".  You can change that to
anything else you like: a different OS, pure gibberish, or nothing at all.
