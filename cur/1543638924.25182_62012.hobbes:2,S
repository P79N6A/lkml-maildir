FWIW, we're building systems with OSB4s, and can consistently 
generate the advertised IDE corruption if we enable Ultra DMA (this 
is with RH 2.4.9-31, which has an extra OSB4 warning message; the 
message correlates with on-disk corruption).
After suffering with PIO for a month or three, we did fairly 
extensive testing with multiword DMA (non-Ultra), and are feeling 
confident enough about it to leave it turned on.
