I'd rather that we fixed dep_* so that undefined symbols were treated as
'n', just like the makefiles treat undefined symbols.
On ARM, we have a lot of CONFIG_ARCH_* variables (which yes, I know, should
be CONFIG_MACH_*, but its too late to change it now), and cluttering up the
place with lots of if ... then fi stuff is much less readable than the
dep_* stuff.
