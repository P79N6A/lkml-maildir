        You don't actually need it (at least for easy cases like that),
because IPv6 defines IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses of the form
::ffff:a.b.c.d. These will generate IPv4 packets for a.b.c.d, from
a v6 socket.
        Unless you're using v6only binding (a sysctl option), you can
connect to v6-only servers using a v4 network and a v4 address of the
server. The peer address on those connections will show up as a v4
mapped address, and all the traffic will be v4, but the socket layer
is all v6.
                                                                +-DLS
