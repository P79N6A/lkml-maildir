I built a small system that runs in 2 stages.  stage 1 basically only
searches for stage 2 and can fit on a floppy.  It has a kernel (no
filesystem support builtin) and a cpio archive that is loaded via initrd. 
It has actually decreased the size and since everything runs out of a tmpfs
filesystem anyway, it works just fine.
I was asking a technical question, not a preferred usage question.
I would think that if the kernel itself can populate a tmpfs from a cpio
archive, it can also mknod /dev/console.  However, I don't know if the
code would increase the kernel more than just having 2 extra entries in a
cpio archive.
