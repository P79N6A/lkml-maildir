Your BMDMA controller is reporting raised interrupt (0x4) and your drive 
is saying that it's ready for the next command, yet interrupt handler of 
sata_via hasn't run and thus the timeout.  It looks like some kind of 
IRQ routing problem to me although I have no idea how the problem 
doesn't affect the boot process.
Can you try to boot with boot parameter pci=noacpi?
