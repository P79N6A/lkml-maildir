I wasn't looking at the printk, I was looking at those 64-bit types. My
argument was that while the small size is incorrect, it shouldn't cause
system stability issues per se - it should just cause IO to potentially
"wrap around" and go to the wrong place on disk.
Which is very serious in itself, of course - but what surprised me was the
quoted system stability things.
Anyway, that patch only matters for the LINEAR MD module, and only for
2TB+ aggregate disks at that, so it doesn't explain any of the other
problematic behaviour. Something else is up.
