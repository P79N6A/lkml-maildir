Same over here with an Asus P6300 notebook (Mobile PII 266, 80M) running
SuSE Linux 6.4 and 2.4.0-test6-pre2. I was able to log in, but the
machine froze soon after that without oops or anything. I tried to
do an emergency sync with Alt-Sysrq-S, but that didn't really help;
the kernel printend "Emergency sync", but the actual sync never
happened.
