I've discovered that we're not the only one to miss dirty / accessed 
"hardware" bits: see include/asm-alpha/pgtable.h (they don't have the 
accessed bit). So maybe we could drop the "fault-on-access" thing.
Also, note the comment before handle_pte_fault:
/*
 * These routines also need to handle stuff like marking pages dirty
 * and/or accessed for architectures that don't do it in hardware (most
 * RISC architectures).  The early dirtying is also good on the i386.
 */
I'm not able to find where we clean the dirty bit on a pte, however it's not 
only done by pte_mkclean, there are some macros like ptep_clear... in 
asm-generic/pgtable.h
