Sure. It was planned, and there once was a half-written patch.
Right now, procps looks for Linux 2.7.0 before even trying.
(at the time, it was looking like the feature wouldn't make it
into the 2.6.xx series and that 2.7.xx would exist)

The only cost is a wasted stat() call to verify the name.
IMHO, using non-standard names is stupid anyway. The people
who do this are probably quite rare. As long as you stick to
the standard device names or devfs, this method is very fast.
(all of these methods will stat() the file to verify it)

That would be fucked up. You need a /dev/tty device.
You need that device even on non-Linux systems.
Also, your abbreviated tty names would start with "/", making
many tools interpret them as absolute paths.
See? Lots of badness happens if you mess with device names.

You'd just better not choose screwball names.

I suggest using devfs.  :-)  The /proc/tty/drivers names
are correct on devfs systems.
We have a Documentation/devices.txt file in the kernel source.
Nearly all of the time, this alone should do the job.
Note that procps needs to handle a tty that udev doesn't
know about, even on a system running udev. It's best to
have everything in /dev with devices.txt names, but somebody
might create a chroot environment somewhere else.
Only the symlinks in /proc can provide this.
In any case, I'm NOT running a udevinfo program or linking
to a screwball library. Random failures are not OK.
