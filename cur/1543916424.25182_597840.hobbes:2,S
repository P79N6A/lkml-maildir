After four hours of bisecting, I got this, which dates back to 2.6.21, but
I've been on 2.6.21.3 for too long and thus missed the commit (I just decided
to be a good citizen and test things before they get out).
dd1447134454b169d5ae353aceb93f2368db8547 is first bad commit

    radeonfb: Add support for Radeon xpress 200m
    Added support for radeon xpress 200m(rs480).  Note that the card doesn't
    like dynclk turned on.

I turned dynclk off, no result (although dynclk is preferred).
What is interesting, is that the driver ignores "vga=normal" and "jumps" to
a quite high res (I think is 1024x768 or something; the fonts look really nice
though :)).
