Hi
I got a LapPower Expander+ (Laptop) with a SystemSoft BIOS version 1.01 subversion 1.23.09. 
The kernel detects a apm BIOS version 1.2 flag 0x03 version 1.9 fine so far but now comes the problem.
Sometimes the kernel manages to detect the battery level sometimes it don't. 
And for battery status I get 0x10 witch is not defined in the documentation in arch/i386/kernel/apm.c
