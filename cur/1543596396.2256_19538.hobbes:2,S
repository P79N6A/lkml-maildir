       Thank you very much for your kindly guide, and I have two question to ask
   you, One question is, Is kmap_high intended to be called merely in the user
   context, so the  highmem pages are mapped into user process page table, so
   on SMP, other processes ( including kernel and user process) that running
   on another cpu doesn't need to get that kmap virtual address.
      Another question is, when kernel evicts old, unused kmap  mapping and
   flushes the whole TLB range( call the flush_all_zero_pkmaps), the TLB won't
   keep those zero  mappings, after that, when user process call kmap_high to
   get a new kmap mappings, and when the process access that virtual
   address, MMU component will get the page directory and page table from MEMORY
   instead of TLB to translate the virtual address into physical  address.
