I think it's safe to say that there is an ongoing effort to do that.
Some more strict typechecking has recently been introduced (read more 
here: 
http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/3848
 ) and this currently cause a 
lot of compiler warnings that have yet to be cleaned, but that will happen 
in time - faster if you lend a hand.

This is due to the fact that the code using that variable is currently 
within an  #if 0  block. I am not familiar with the mtd code, but the 
comment in there has this to say :
#if 0 /* Some people seem to have devices without ECC or erase marks
         on the Media Header blocks. There are enough other sanity
         checks in here that we can probably do without it.
      */
...
#endif
So it would seem that this bit of code could be on its way out. I'd assume 
that once it goes (if it does) that the variable will then be removed as 
well.
Ohh and btw, if you want people to pay attention to your emails you should 
try adding a descriptive Subject:  :)
