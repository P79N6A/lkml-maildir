I strongly disagree. I got suspend-to-RAM to work but its utility is seriously 
limited by battery capacity. For example, on my laptop (Sony VGN-B100B) with 
1.5GB of RAM, a fully charged battery is drained in about 18 hours if the 
laptop was suspended to RAM. 
Yes, for a few hours suspend-to-RAM is convenient but suspend-to-disk is 
_reliable_ and _safe_.
