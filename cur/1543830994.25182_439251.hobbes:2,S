Overall...  ACK from me.  Thanks for listening.

Agreed overall, though specifically for delayed allocation I think 
that's an ext4 thing:
* First off, I'm a big fan of delalloc, and (like extents) definitely 
want to see the feature implemented
* Delayed allocation, properly done, requires careful interaction with 
VM writeback (memory pressure or normal writeout), and may require some 
minor changes to generic code in fs/* and mm/*
* Delayed allocation changes I/O ordering, and may require some retuning 
for workloads to remain optimal
* Delayed allocation changes data layout on disk.  HOPEFULLY for the 
better, but we won't know that until its been hammered a bit in the field.
So while I agree it has no format impacts, I also think it has a 
non-trivial -- and currently unknown -- impact on stable systems.
Also for the reasons listed, I think ext4 would be a far superior 
testbed for delalloc.

I continue to have a concern that it will become tougher over time to 
support all these features in the same codebase...  so consider this a 
reluctant "ACK" for this last paragraph.  :)
