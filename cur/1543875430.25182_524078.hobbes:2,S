Yes.

We don't touch private mappings at all as they're a snapshot to the inode 
_before_ it was revoked. So private mappings don't really matter all: you 
don't see any new data after it has been revoked nor do you flush anything 
to the disk.

Well, assuming we would use revoke for things like SAK, this doesn't 
really work out too well because all a malicious process has to is create 
a shared mapping and they've effectively blocked the whole thing.

It's antisocial for sure but the only way to guarantee revoke() succeeds 
on a NOMMU setup. Oh well, lets disable it for now and see if anyone even 
wants revoke() for NOMMU.

That's a good idea. I'll add one.
