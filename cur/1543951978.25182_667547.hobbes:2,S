Yes to "_all_ DMA writes". re-read the second sentence.

aka MMIO writes. Not defined and in general unrelated. AFAIK, no
version of PCI has ordering rules for traffic going in opposite
directions. I'm 99% sure about this but haven't reviewed any
PCI docs in about 2 years.
Note I think it's possible for DMA READs to complete out of order
given PCI-x (IIRC) and PCI-e (I'm certain) support split transactions.
This means a device can have multiple DMA reads in flight and the
chipset/system firmware (aka BIOS) have to enable and support this
functionality as well. I _believe_ those split transactions can
complete out of order (since they are tagged like SCSI/SATA are)
and I expect it's up to the device to deal with that already.
Devices which do not support or use more than one split transaction
obviously won't have any DMA READ ordering issues.
On a related note, I always think of MSI/MSI-X as DMA Writes.
Michael's got me thinking we need to explicitly state that.
In "normal" use, the device will not issue an MSI until after
the "completion DMA write" has been issued and thus the MSI/MSI-X
transactions are NOT subject to the ordering requirement...but
that's not exactly true. We don't want the MSI to ever
pass the "completion DMA write".
Do we need to state the platform interconnect can NOT allow
successive DMA writes to pass the ordered DMA writes?
Or state MSI DMA writes are implied to be to an "ordered DMA region"?
Both statements?
> Does DMA_ATTR_BARRIER have any effect on reads?
It could but it's not defined to. :)
I thought about this before but wanted to keep the document short.
Perhaps two things should be done to address this:
1) rename this to DMA_ATTR_WRITE_BARRIER
2) state it has no explicit effect on DMA Reads.
If someone needs that changed in the future, we can then
define how reading from a region will trigger ordering rules.
