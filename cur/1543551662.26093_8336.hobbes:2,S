I too was having this problem from 2.4.0-test5 to 2.4.0-test9.
2.4.0-test10-pre1 appears to have corrected it (so far at least).  I am
indeed using a half duplex 10mbs LAN, but there are really only 2 hosts
transmitting, me and my NFS server (Well, my ISDN router too, but all
things considered it's very little traffic.)
It happenened under heavy AND light load, and it never recovered.
