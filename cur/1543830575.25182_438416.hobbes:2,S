This is a known problem with GRUB: it tries to put initrd at the highest
possible address in memory, and assumes the standard vmalloc area size.
You need to trick GRUB into thinking that your machine has less memory
by using "uppermem 524288" (512M) or even lower - then the initrd data
will still be accessible for the kernel even with larger vmalloc area.

Add "uppermem 524288" here.
