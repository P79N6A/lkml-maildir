Hi,
Apologies for the semi-offtopic message but ever since support for 
Synaptics' absolute mode went in many people complained that it 
broke GPM. 
I did some work on extending evdev support in GPM, the new protocol
implementation supports following subtypes:
1. relative device - standard relative device like generic PS/2 mouse
   reporting via /dev/input/eventX
2. absolute device - touch screens and tablets.
3. touchpad - device reporting absolute coordinates and pressure via
   /dev/input/event, GPM recognizes normal and corner tapping.
4. synaptics - same as touchpad but also supports multi-finger taps
   (expects MSC_GESTURE messages from the kernel).
Kernel has to support EV_SYNC for touchpad and synaptics support, 
relative and absolute modes can be used with 2.4 kernels by specifying
nosync option.
You will find the patches at:

RPMs (binary and source) built on RH8 are at:
http://www.geocities.com/dt_or/gpm/RPMS/
The README is at:

The patches work pretty well for me and I hope they will work for others too.
Because of limited hardware I could not test evdev with touchscreen or a 
tablet.
Dmitry.
