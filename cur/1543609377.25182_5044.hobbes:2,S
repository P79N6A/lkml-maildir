I would prefer to have the information at compile-time, so that I would get
a compiler error if I did something wrong.
But that's unrealistic - some counter could change it's type from kernel
release to kernel release.
Now, my program needs to deal with the data, perform operations on it,
so naturally I need to know what kind of data I'm dealing with.  Most likely,
my software will *expect* some certain type, but if I have no way of verifying
that my assumption is correct, I will lose sooner or later...

Uh. Any program using /proc data ?

So my program runs for two months and then aborts with an error because
some counter just happened to no longer fit into whatever type I assumed
it was ?
Come on - you just can't code like that...
