Indeed.
If Andrew agrees, then I'll commit to doing this cleanup;
- no two statements on same line
- no funky spaces between function names, arguments etc.
- no spaces instead of proper tabs.
- (to a limited degree) no trailing whitespace
- perhaps other whitespace cleanups as per Codingstyle
For the entire tree.
No actual code changes - should be resonably easy to review.
Some can be semi-automated, some can't, and it'll take time and be a 
royal pain. But if Andrew will take the patches I'll do it (in some 2 
digit nr of patches (aiming for <50 - obviously guessing wildly here)).
I'll need time to do this - no matter how you cut it there are a lot of 
files, and a lot of lines - so don't expect the patch bombing to start for 
the next few weeks.
And before I embark on this venture I'd like some feedback that when I do 
turn up with patches they'll have a resonable chance of getting merged - 
this is going to be a lot of boring work, and with no commitment to merge 
anything it's not something I want to waste days on...  Sounds fair?
Ohh, and I'd be submitting all the patches to you Andrew, not individual 
maintainers/authors..
