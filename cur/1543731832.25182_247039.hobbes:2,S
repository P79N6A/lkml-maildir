While I was playing with using the CryptoAPI in /dev/random for my own
purposes, I noticed that I was getting quite a few "schedual while atomic!"
console messages.
Talking with Michal Ludvig, I seem to think that a "!is_atomic()" check
inside crypto_yield() or passing a flag during crypto_alloc_tfm() would make
a lot of sense.
This may be more directed at James Morris, but here it goes:
Can we have some logic to either check for or turn off crypto_yield()'s in
crypto/internal.h's crypto_yield() ?
Cheers,
JLC
