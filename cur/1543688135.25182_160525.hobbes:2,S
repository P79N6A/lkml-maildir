I assume you are using the corresponding updated modutils package that
is compatible with 2.6 kernels. This new modutils package uses
/etc/modprobe.conf instead of the old /etc/modules.conf.
Since both files are almost compatible, you can safely copy the contents
of /etc/modules.conf to /etc/modprobe.conf.
