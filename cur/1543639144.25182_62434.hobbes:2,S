Actually that was what I was assuming when I noted that the 2.5 appeared
to be slower by a good bit for some high load values of dbench. In a
perfect world the kernel would hit the hardware spped, guess no one is
claiming that until 2.7 ;-)
The initial results from the io scheduler, as posted here, look as if
there will be a way to "take it up another notch" in the future.
Thanks much for the clarification, the data are useful even if they do
show room for improvement in the corner case.
