I wish ABit were more involved in solving this problem.  Being the
designer and manufacturer of the motherboard, they most definitely would
have the required test equipment to properly diagnose the problem at hand.
If the problem ends up being a particular sensitivity to cooling and/or
power supply, life is good and those with this board (myself included) can
make provisions to fix the problem, otherwise we'll be wondering forever
as to what the cause is.

I am not entirely convinced of this.  Some people who've reported their
machine being 'clean' aren't even running 2.3.x kernels that log these
APIC errors.  I've 'caught' at least one person myself.

I agree completely!
