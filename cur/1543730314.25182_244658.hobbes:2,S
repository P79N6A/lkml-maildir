I hate to say it, but why reinvent the wheel? I'm sure that if Jorg 
doesn't support new technology there will be a project, either on 
sourceforge or freestanding, to create OpenCDburn or some such. It would 
be very hard to find someone as technically good as Jorg in this area, 
and hard to find anyone worse at working with others.
That's really sad, because if he would accept more from others and not 
insist on having the last (or only) word on every issue the software 
would move faster and with less hostility.
