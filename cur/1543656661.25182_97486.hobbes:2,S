Go back and read the postings by Uli.
Uli's suggested glibc approach is to just put the magis system call 
address (which glibc gets from the AT_SYSINFO elf aux table entry) into 
the per-thread TLS area, which is alway spointed to by %gs anyway.
THIS WORKS WITH ALL DSO'S WITHOUT ANY GAMES, ANY MMAP'S, ANY RELINKING, OR
ANY EXTRA WORK AT ALL!
The system call entry becomes a simple
	call *%gs:constant-offset
Not mmap. No magic system calls. No relinking. Not _nothing_. One 
instruction, that's it. 
See for example Uli's posting in this thread from the day before
yesterday, message ID <3DFF6D4B.3060107@redhat.com>. So please stop 
arguing about any extra work, because none is needed.
