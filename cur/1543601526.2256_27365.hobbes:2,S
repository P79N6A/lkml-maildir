Hmm...Without even thinking about it, I assumed it would start a read and
select() or poll() or some later call would return readable when my
outstanding request was fulfilled.  But yes, I guess you're right, this is
different behavior because there is no other side.
Reading a file would need a receive queue to make this work, I guess. :)
