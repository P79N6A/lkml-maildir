It works like the similar feature in NT does.  Setting the
compression flag on a file will compress that file
immediately.  Setting it on a directory, indicates that any files
put in the dir should be compressed as well (inheritance).
You need to use e2compr patches though, and also update all
utils that manage the filesystem (fsck, etc..) so that they are
e2compr aware.

ATIME is the file/directory's access time.  It is set every time
a file is accessed at all - read/write.  Since this field is of
minimal use in a lot of cases, and since it causes enough
filesystem overhead to set, quite often it is better to have the
ability to disable it.  The mount noatime and nodiratime disables
the atime on files and dirs respectively for the whole mounted
filesystem.  A noatime flag stored in the directory however would
allow disabling of atime on a per file or directory basis.  IMHO
it would be a very useful thing to have.  I played with this flag
a bit, and it does not appear to work.

They have equipment that can read data off disks even after it
has been erased and written over many times.  Supposedly up to 9
times overwritten, but I've heard that it can be read much deeper
than that.  It most likely is because of minute amounts of
residual magnetism.  The government does this, and likely anyone
with similar capacity's as well as data recovery houses.
By writing over the sectors with random garbage 40 times, it
ensures the highest chance that recovery of whatever was there is
next to impossible.  Think of it like writing a note on a pad of
paper with a normal yellow pencil, or a pen.  After you tear the
note off, it is gone right?  Not if you pressed hard enough that
the pattern of letters is impressed upon the next piece of
paper.  Each piece of paper has an imprint of what you wrote,
although each successive paper will have less and less of the
impression.  New messages written on the top piece of paper will
gradually mix up the impressions.  Much like a piece of carbon
paper that is used over and over again too.  The first time it is
used, you can read it.  After many uses, it becomes difficult if
not impossible to see what was written.  Same goes for the hard
disk.
Hope this helps.  TTYL
