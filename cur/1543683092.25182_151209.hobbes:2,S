For proper Synaptics support an XFree86 driver is available (get it at
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/index.html
). This will allow
for full support, including gesture recongition. Passthrough support for
enabling the touchpoint or external mice chained to the Synaptics pad is
pending in my patch queue and will be merged as soon as I return from
Ottawa.
Support for touchpads is nonexistent in mousedev.c, it only supports
mice, digitizers and touchscreens. Just adding an entry to the device
tableis futile, you'd need much much more than that.
