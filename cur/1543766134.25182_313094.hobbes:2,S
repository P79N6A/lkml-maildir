Yes, the /sys/module/aoe area is only present when the aoe driver is a
module.  It would be nicer if there were a sysfs area where I could
put this file regardless of whether the driver is a module or built
into the kernel.  
I could probably create one, but I got the file in
/sys/module/aoe/parameters for free when I used module_param_string.

Yes.  That's true.  Redundancy isn't always bad, though, and using the
"aoe_" prefix lets the kernel parameter for the built-in aoe driver be
the same as the parameter for the modular driver.
