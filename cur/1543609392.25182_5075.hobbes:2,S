Erk, the behaviour of str with your patch isn't quite compatible 
enough for a smooth transition.  What is really needed is to have 
"str" error out or generate the existing strl with a huge warning 
about unspecified type.  Either way the kernel has to work with 
both old and new tools for a brief period of time.
