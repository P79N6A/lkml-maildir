I just don't see any problem that is really new. Alan's example is one
of more extreme ones, but the only effect is that an operation can be
delayed far more than usual, but not indefinitely.
If you think preemption can cause a deadlock, maybe you could give me a
hint, which of the conditions for a deadlock is changed by preemption?

If I had known, how easily people are offended by implying they could
act out of financial interest, I hadn't made that comment. Sorry, but
I'm just annoyed, how you attack any attempt to add realtime
capabilities to the kernel, mostly with the argument that it sucks under
IRIX. I people want to try it, let them. I prefer to see patches and if
they should really suck, I would be first one to say so.
bye, Roman
