Can't direct IO from a hugepage?

As far as pagecache page management goes, is that an issue for you?
I don't want to know about how many billions of pages for some operation,
just some profiles.

The number is irrelevant, it is the rate that is important.

I'm not saying that. You brought up this subject of variable sized pagecache.

Considering you're just handwaving about the actual problems, I
don't know. I assume you're sitting in front of some workload that has
gone wrong, so can't you elaborate?
Eventually, increasing x86 page size a bit might be an idea. We could even
do it in software if CPU manufacturers don't for us.
That doesn't buy us a great deal if you think there is this huge looming
problem with struct page management though.
