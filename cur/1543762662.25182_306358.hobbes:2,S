Changes:
- added include <asm/types.h> to lots of files
Well, I could've figured out that my test scripts won't catch problems 
introduced by forcing usage of types from {linux,asm}/types.h, but I had to 
stumble across such a bug to get the idea. One way or the other, I hope 
that's fixed.
Happy Easter.
