Hi,
We are having problems under arm26 having upgraded to .70; getting an
oops directly after the POSIX conformance...
<6>ksoftirqd/0 (0): address exception: pc=020ab494
Code: eb001b23 ebffb8b5 e5846030 e5950004 (e5971004)
kernel/sched.c: 245: spin_lock(kernel/sched.c:021a8000) already locked
by kernel/sched.c/1271
I won't go any further because I've done some debugging and next is set
to 0 in all the schedule() calls. prev looks about right...
Someone suggested to me that some of the init_idle stuff has changed.
This might explain it, but I'm not sure where next is being set up
incorrectly.
Any ideas?
TIA
John
