If you like Motorola and MIPS, then there are places
where you fit in:
http://linuxce.org/
Much effort going into porting Linux to palm top
devices.  The LinuxCE group is presently working with
the NEC-VR (MIPS clones), and SH3.
There is another group here:
http://uclinux.org/
They have linux running on some embedded motorola
chips (no MMU) such as the Dragonball used in the
Palm Pilot and friends.
The kernel basicly boots on these architectures,
but there's clearly work to be done in porting
user space apps, libraries (glibc most notably),
some tool development (cross compilers, boot
loaders, emulators), and of course drivers.
Eventually, some of these things get rolled back
into the main kernel tree when they prove to have
the right level of usefullness and longevity.
