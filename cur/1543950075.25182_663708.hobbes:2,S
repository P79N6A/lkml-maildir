One more update on the reverted patch: Comparing with 2.6.24, cpu2000-fp has about
4% regression with kernel 2.6.25-rc on my madison IPF machine. As you know, cpu2000-fp
consists of many sub-testing. The most regression looks relevant to a couple of testing
in the middle step. But if I ran the sub-testing manually, I couldn't see any regression.
If I started kernel with boot parameter maxcpus=1, the regression becomes 1%.
If I apply Peter's revert patch to 2.6.25-rc3, the regression also becomes 1%.
I don't know what causes the last 1% regression.
