   	Dave M.: I am cc'ing this to because you asked for a
   bus-independent API for allocating DMA consistent memory when I
   discusssed consolidating some other driver DMA mapping operations
   about six months ago.
I don't know how much I like the DMA memory being allocated
transparently based upon some structure initialization values.
I'd rather the DMA alloc/free be explicit in the drivers.
Otherwise, the ->ops->alloc_consistent et al. abstraction
looks ok.
