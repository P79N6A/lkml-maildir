Okay, the patch worked!  Thanks.
BTW, I noticed this unrelated issue when recompiling:
WARNING: "__stack_chk_fail"
[drivers/net/wireless/hostap/hostap_plx.ko] undefined!
WARNING: "__stack_chk_fail"
[drivers/net/wireless/hostap/hostap_pci.ko] undefined!
WARNING: "__stack_chk_fail" [drivers/net/wireless/hostap/hostap_cs.ko]
undefined!
Cheers,
