Hmm.. nice cheap card but that's exactly what it is.. cheap.
It uses totally software wavetable, uses more CPU than the MX300 and the SB
Live (especially when compared to SB Live), doesn't have a plug for rear
speakers, A3d emulation is good but EAX is shoddy at best. At least, this is
what the card does under Windows, I don't have experience with the linux
drivers for it.

It does do Midi very well.. I must admit.
