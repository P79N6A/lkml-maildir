I did.  I see nowhere that handles the case where the user uses a util 
(hdparm or blktool) to switch off write cache after sd.c has probed the 
disk.  sd only sets its WCE bit at probe time, and doesn't appear to 
notice state changes.
Since nobody snoops the MODE SELECT on the caching page, nobody knows 
past probe the state of write caching.
Thus my comment...   I think barrier support should know about that sort 
of thing :)
