    Seeing that GENERIC_TIME has been thrown out from the -rt patch, it makes 
no sense now (even if I had time -- I also decided to leave this to Thomas as 
the HRT maintainer). Concerning this change: tghe patch that comments out 
recalc_time_offset() call in arch/powerpc/kernel/time.c must have be thrown 
out as well since it's breaking TOD vsyscall support now.
