Maybe the attached file will help.  It's a bz2 of the strace typescript
and tail /var/log/messages which I ran.  I came home after a long day,
remembered I had the strace going.  I switched over in to that window,
and in a term, did "ls ./winnt", promptly causing the strace to exit and
generating the Input/output error.  The strace was a little long, so I
zipped it up...
