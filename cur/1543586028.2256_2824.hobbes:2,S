Actually, it probably won't.  As has already been said in the past, the
names are effectively a user space issue, but major numbers aren't.
I for one would like to see a major number for all 'serial ports' whether
they be embedded ARM serial ports _or_ standard 16550 ports, but at the
moment its not easily acheivable without introducing more mess.
Ted indicated to me a while ago (just after I wrote serial_core.c for
yet-another-type-of-ARM-serial-port) his visions of the direction serial
stuff should take in 2.5; this is obviously one of the things that I'm
keen to discuss and solve in 2.5.
