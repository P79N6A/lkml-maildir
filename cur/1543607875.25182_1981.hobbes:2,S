Intel eepro100 cards, using Intel drivers (e100) and the ANS subsystem
(all available from Intel for free - as in beer) allow this
at the kernel-level, using link-detection to determine whether
to fail over.
They allow for failover, dual-active (only when sending) and Fast
EtherChannel.
Generally speaking, it shouldn't be hard to do it.
A shell script would be inefficient computation-wise, but should be simple
and
quite reliable: arping your default gateway and if it fails more than
X times ifconfig down; ifconfig up.
