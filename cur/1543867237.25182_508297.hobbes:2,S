It's actually more likely a lot more efficient to let the system call 
itself do the sanity checking. That allows the common system calls (that 
*don't* need to even check) to just not do anything at all, instead of 
having some complex logic in the common system call execution trying to 
figure out for each system call whether it is ok or not.
Ie, we could just add to "do_fork()" (which is where all of the 
vfork/clone/fork cases end up) a simple case like
	err = wait_async_context();
	if (err)
		return err;
or
	if (in_async_context())
		return -EINVAL;
or similar. We need that "async_context()" function anyway for the other 
cases where we can't do other things concurrently, like changing the UID.
I would suggest that "wait_async_context()" would do:
 - if weare *in* an async context, return an error. We cannot wait for 
   ourselves!
 - if we are the "real thread", wait for all async contexts to go away 
   (and since we are the real thread, no new ones will be created, so this 
   is not going to be an infinite wait)
The new thing would be that wait_async_context() would possibly return 
-ERESTARTSYS (signal while an async context was executing), so any system 
call that does this would possibly return EINTR. Which "fork()" hasn't 
historically done. But if you have async events active, some operations 
likely cannot be done (setuid() and execve() comes to mind), so you really 
do need something like this.
And obviously it would only affect any program that actually would _use_ 
any of the suggested new interfaces, so it's not like a new error return 
would break anything old.
