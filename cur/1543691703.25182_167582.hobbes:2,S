When I wrote "128" I was not aware that this is linked to the cache line 
size. Initially it was ">128", just as an arbitrary number. I replaced 
that with "> 116" due to an unrelated change, and that crashed, because 
the cache line size was set to 128 bytes.
My patch fixes this bug: It replaces the limits with >=116 [avoid 
wasting too much memory, guarantee that there is a cache for the 
off-slab control structures] and > SMP_CACHE_LINE_SIZE [guarantee that 
there is a cache for the off-slab control structures].
Right now there are too many patches in Andrew's tree, I'll wait until 
everything settled down a bit, then I'll resent the cache line size as a 
one-line patch. Do you want to implement CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC 
immediately? If yes, then I can send you the oneliner immediately. 
Nothing except CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is affected by the bug.
