could be because scrolling the wheel generates several kinds of events
(up, down but also fast up, fast down etc), and only some of them get
interpreted. Verify the events by using the verbose=1 parameter.

If you don't have a Back button then you can adjust the 'mask' module
parameter in order to detect only the events you are interested in. And
before you ask yes, Sony reused the same codes for several types of
events...

And also daemons more sonypi specific which read /dev/sonypi instead,
like sonypid, sonypidd, jogdiald, kde etc.
