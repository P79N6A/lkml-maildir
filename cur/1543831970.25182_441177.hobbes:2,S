- The __init-style tags on declarations don't actually do anything and
  the compiler doesn't check for consistency with the definition - it's
  best to just omit it from the declaration.
- Setting nr_kernel_pages to be unloaded at free_initmem() seems risky.
- nr_kernel_pages is actually __meminitdata.
So I'll drop this hunk.
