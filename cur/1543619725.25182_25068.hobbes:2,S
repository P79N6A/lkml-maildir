Hmm, you may also need to delete /dev/urandom too.  Reading from
/dev/urandom will also deplete the entropy pool just as much as
reading from /dev/random.  The only difference is that /dev/random
will block if there aren't enough bits as requested, while reads
from /dev/urandom will happily continue to return data which isn't
"backed" by any entropy.
You could also enable debugging in drivers/char/random.c to see what
is going on (it may be very verbose).  You could even change the one
message in extract_entropy() to include the command name, like:
	DEBUG_ENT("%s has %d bits, %s wants %d bits\n",
		  r == sec_random_state ? "secondary" :
		  r == random_state ? "primary" : "unknown",
		  current->comm, r->entropy_bits, nbytes * 8);
(not sure of exact usage for current->comm, but you could use ->pid
instead).
Note that even traffic over the network will deplete your entropy
pool, because it is using secure_tcp_sequence_number() and secure_ip_id().
Also, using SYN cookies appears to increase the amount of entropy used.
Cheers, Andreas
