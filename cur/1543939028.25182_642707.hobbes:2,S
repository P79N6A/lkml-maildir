As I already mentioned in private, the code is here:
http://www.init0.nl/iriverfs-r0.1.0.1-linux-2.6.23.patch.bz2
It's basically abusing the USB driver stack with a ->probe() function
that returns -ENODEV and doing device discovery at mount time. That,
however, is also broken as it assumes there's only one device plugged
in (we're not passing any device identifier to sys_mount).
So it's not a simple code change at all. Are there any datasheets
available for these things or is the current driver reverse
engineered?
