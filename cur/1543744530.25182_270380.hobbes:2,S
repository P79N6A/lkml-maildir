Matt, I'll revert the EXTENDED READ change for now, then. The random
behaviour of the problem it causes makes me really dislike this bug, and
I'd like to release a -rc2 and start calming down the 2.6.10 stuff, but
having known random stuff happen really disturbs me.
We can re-do it once it's more obvious why it broke..
