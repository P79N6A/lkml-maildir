No - as I wrote, I tested only with qemu, without networking. Thus the 
bh queue was never used. Just booting a complete system with 
uniprocessor, spinlock debugging enabled immediately showed a bug in 
line 315: It unlocked rcu_state.lock instead of rsp->lock :-(
pseudo-patch:
 out_unlock_all:
-                spin_unlock(&rcu_state.lock);
+                spin_unlock(&rsp->lock);
        }
