Hi Linus.
First set of kbuild related fixes and other stuff.
o Anders fixed up qnx and I took this patch via my tree
  as it is a general include header issue.
o Andi added a new script 'config' to manipulate the configuration
  It needs some polishing but is usefull as is
o Arjan improved bootchart - and I took his word for that it is an improvement
o Jike added back ALLSOURCE_ARCHS to tags as it is actually used
o Wolfram fixed some documentation typos
o And I fixed a modules_install regression
All in all only small details.
Outstanding things at the moments:
- The patches to strip modules and vmlinux causes troubles:
  o With MODVERSIONS enabled ccache and distcc does no longer improve things
  o sparc build is br0ken
- Alan's reported issue with broken 32 bit build is not solved - awaiting feedback from Alan
I dunno what to do to make people start looking at all the warnings our
exported headers generates. Maybe I should let headers_check error ou if
there is more than 10 warnings in a directory..
