Yes ... really the only case for unprep is when we've partially released
the command (like in scsi_io_completion) where we need to tear the rest
of it down.
The rule should be that if it needs preparing, then it's in the same
state as the block layer would send it to us in (with no appendages).
For most requeues, we have all the prepared resources attached, so they
don't need tearing down and repreparing.

Yes, but only if the command will be prepared again.

No, that's zeroed out when the command is allocated.  It's only set in
the path that sends down a scsi_request.
