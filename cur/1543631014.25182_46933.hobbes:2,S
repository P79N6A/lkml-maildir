Subject: 2.5.16: old tulip (de2104x) can't be compiled in

In 2.5.15 and 2.5.16, tulip driver version for old chips (de2104x) can't
be compiled in. make bzImage fails with
drivers/net/net.o(.data+0xcd4): undefined reference to `local symbols in discarded section .text.exit'
It works when compiled as a module.
Another but smaller problem is that it's way too verbose in my setup
(crossover cable to realtek with 8139too driver and 2.4.18). Every
minute it logs the following line:
eth0: 10baseT-HD link ok, status ffffffc8
The computer is Digital Celebris GL 5133 ST with onboard 21040. Works
fine in 2.4.19pre.
