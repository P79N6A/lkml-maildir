Hi Pierre,
Here is some piece of code that i wrote for SDIO. I use 2.6.10 kernel
and hence i can not really take a diff between the latest kernel
version. But this is not really a patch. So, You can just comment on
my code. I might later on work on the latest kernel versions based on
your comment.I see that there are more discussions happening. Please
pont to me if you have some code already written.
After your previous mail, i see that i can remove the support for CMD3
seperately for SDIO and do it the SD way. But i am not sure how to
maintain the list of SDIO cards seperately.Also some hardware as our
omap does, can support multiple MMC slots, in such cases one slot can
have SDIO and the other MMC. The core needs to cliam the cards from
different lists. So you may see some not so correct parts in my code.
I am on the Texas Instruments MMC/SD/SDIO controller on the omap2 platform.
Regards,
Madhu
