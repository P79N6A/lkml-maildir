Subject: [PATCH] fix hpet drift and url
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

   The HPET driver is using a parts per second drift factor instead of
the standard parts per million drift the time interpolator code expects.
This patch fixes that problem and updates the URL for the HPET spec.
