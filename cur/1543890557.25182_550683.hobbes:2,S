yeah.  Often this process will tell you that the oops was in
spin_lock_irq() or list_add() or something useless like that.
So the next step is to start adding and subtracting 4, 8, 12, ...
to the EIP value until you "fall out" of the inlined function and 
back into the callee.
But I'm not sure that I'd want to have to describe that process
(especially the means by which one determines that it is necessary)
to normal people ;)
