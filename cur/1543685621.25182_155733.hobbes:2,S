Actually, I was going to move all this stuff to the embedded menu as soon as I 
caught up on Linux-kernel to make sure nobody else had already done it.  (I 
was only 2500 messages behind the day before yesterday, but people keep 
posting more... :)
Finding out that Alan beat me to this is exactly why I'm catching up on my 
reading before pushing patches. :)
The 2.5 kernel I just compiled is currently about three times larger than the 
uclibc+busybox root filesystem I built yesterday.  I'm all for stripping it 
down, but saying that your average server doesn't need the ability to plug in 
a monitor and keyboard and see what's up if it suddenly goes peculiar...  
Well, I wouldn't want to support that system, and certainly Red Hat ain't 
gonna ship like that any time soon.  (As for the servers you mentioned in 
your previous post, we're potentially saving tens of kilobytes by doing so, 
on a system with around gigabyte of ram.  So if we're saving 10-30k (not just 
kernel code but run-time allocations), we're talking about saving 0.001 to 
0.003% of ram on a server setup.  Oooh.  Aaaah.  Definitely the kind of 
micro-optimization we want everybody in the world (and their dog) to have to 
figure out if they need or not the first time they compile a kernel.)
