I think sem->sleepers initially started as a counter, but was later converted
to a boolean value (0 or 1). The only possible values of sem->sleepers is 0, 1
or 2 and we always use sem->sleepers - 1 and set the value to either 0 or 1.
sem->sleepers is set to 0, so that when the double wakeup is called on the
wait queue, the task that wakes up (P2) corrects the count to 
(sem->sleepers - 1) = -1. This ensures that other tasks do not acquire 
the semaphore with down() (count is -1) and P2 sets sem->sleepers back to 1 
and sleeps.

P1->up() will do a wake_up() only if count < 0. For no wake_up()
the count >=0 before the increment. This means that there is no one
sleeping on the semaphore.
Feel free to correct me,
