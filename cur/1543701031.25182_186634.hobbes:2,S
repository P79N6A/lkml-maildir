Subject: mount from debian to 44bsd, chown bug report?

Hello everyone.  I am booting up into a bootable Knoppix 3.2 (Debian Linux)
CD-R (www.knoppix.net) and trying to mount my FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE partition.
The working command-line is:
`mount -t ufs -o ufstype=44bsd /dev/hda2 /mnt/fbsd`
At one time I was naturally able to read/write files to the partition once
it was mounted, but then I chowned the root directory to "knoppix."  Now
here is what's happening:
  # whoami ; mount | grep 44bsd
  root
  /dev/hda2 on /mnt/test type ufs (rw,ufstype=44bsd)
  # ls -al /mnt | grep knoppix
  drwxr-x--x   25 knoppix  root         1024 Dec 18 22:10 /mnt/test
  # grep ufs /proc/filesystems
  ufs
  # chown root /mnt/test
  chown: changing ownership of `test': Read-only file system
The error above contradicts the "mount" info, namely, the "rw" part!!
Is this a BUG?  Might a fix be to give the user "knoppix" the ability
to mount?  Please help me, someone...?
