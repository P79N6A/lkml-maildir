This is the same thing as all those "sleeping while atomic"
(might_sleep) bugs below.  It is just a debugging check.  It does the
same check as might_sleep but during schedule().
If you had specific culprits (i.e. foo() calls bar() which schedules
while foo() holds the baz lock) would be very useful.  Otherwise listing
this as a problem is not useful.

Should be fixed in bk.

Is this still not fixed?  Ugh.
BTW, I like the fact you are listing specific atomicity issues.  Thank
you.  It is a lot more useful than just saying there are "sleeping while
atomic" bugs.
