So basically - when we move block devices to the page cache, get rid of
buffer cache usage in the filesystems as well?  Ext2 is nearly there at
least.  One alternative is as Daniel Phillips did in the indexed-ext2-
directory patch, where he kept the "bread" interface, but backed it
with the page cache, so it required relatively little change to the
filesystem.
Cheers, Andreas
