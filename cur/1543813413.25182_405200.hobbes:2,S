But we don't compile the kernel with -fpic...  We might want to, for kdump
convenience at some stage, perhaps.
If we do, it'd be better to simply replace those _syscallX functions with
versions which work in either mode, rather than having two versions.
The syscallX() macros are almost obsolete - it's preferred that code simply
include syscalls.h and call sys_foo() directly.  But there are a few
hard-to-convert places, iirc.
