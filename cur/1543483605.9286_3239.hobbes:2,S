Subject: Missing source code for tunnelling?

	Hello, I want to report (what seems to me as ) a bug. If I try to
configure the kernel to make modules for IP tunnelling (Networking options
-> IP: tunnelling -> Module), the module for tunnelling does not get made,
while it seems to work if compiled in the kernel. I did not find the file
that used to contain the source code for this module (new_tunnel.c), maybe
there is some mismatch between new filenames and the Makefiles for
modules? What is, or should be the name of the new module?
	Moreover, if I enable QoS and fair scheduling and try to
get some schedulers made as modules, I get unresolved dependencies when I
run depmod after installing the kernel, even if I did not get any errors
at compile time. 
Thanks
Giacomo Mulas
