Oh, I agree.
I think we should continue the simplification of the simple stuff. If 
somebody just wants to sleep a while, do it.
But if somebody is doing this because they think "jiffies" are evil, then 
that somebody is being a total idiot. Jiffies aren't evil. They are 
basically the most efficient way to handle any kind of absolute timeouts, 
and any "repeating timeout" _needs_ to be written in absolute terms.
And quite frankly, in this discussion I have several times seen the 
argument that we should be getting rid of jiffies because somebody thinks 
jiffies are "hard" and somehow incompatible with "tickless".
THAT is the thinking I want to squash.
We're not getting rid of jiffies, and we're not going to be "tickless". We 
might have a variable clock, but that has _nothing_ to do with the basic 
fact that even a variable clock needs a fundamental baseline, and that the 
kernel _needs_ a heartbeat.
And that baseline and heartbeat is HZ and "jiffies". End of story. Anybody
who argues for getting rid of it just isn't thinking things through.

That's not even true.
A _lot_ of drivers end up caring about absolute time, because a _lot_ of 
drivers have a very simple issue like:
 - poll this port every 10ms until it returns "ready", or until we time
   out after 500ms.
And the thing is, you can do it the stupid way:
	for (i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
		if (ready())
			return 0;
		msleep(10);
	}
	.. timeout ..
or you can do it the _right_ way. The stupid way is simpler, but anybody 
who doesn't see what the problem is has some serious problems in kernel 
programming. Hint: it might not be polling for half a second, it might be 
polling for half a _minute_ for all you know.
In other words, the _right_ way to do this is literally
	unsigned long timeout = jiffies + HZ/2;
	for (;;) {
		if (ready())
			return 0;
		if (time_after(timeout, jiffies))
			break;
		msleep(10);
	}
which is unquestionably more complex, yes, but it's more complex because 
it is CORRECT!
And yes, we have had people "simplifying" drivers and screwing things like 
this up. And you don't even notice, until the machine is under heavy load, 
and then the "simplified" driver ends up being very very broken, and 
people wonder why performance sucks.
So stop saying that drivers not needing absolute timeouts. They need it
qutie often.
