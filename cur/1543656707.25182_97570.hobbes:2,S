Hopefully you could make it more generic than just for kernel bugs.
Ideally it would be nice to be able to have both an interactive submission
and a way to mail a version number and get back a questionare to fill in
and resubmit. This allows for a custom form for some versions, as well as
another mail back listing known bugs fixed in later versions, to avoid
reporting fixed bugs.
I'm not sure if it would be possible to make a frontend to bugzilla, I'm
not thrilled with the whole thing, but I have no illusions of having
enough free time to tackle anything that large.
