Subject: [PATCH 00/10] percpu: Per cpu code simplification V4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patchset simplifies the code that arches need to maintain to support
per cpu functionality. Most of the code is moved into arch independent
code. Only a minimal set of definitions is kept for each arch.
The patch also unifies the x86 arch so that there is only a single
asm-x86/percpu.h
Based on: 2.6.24-rc6-mm1
---
V1->V2:
- Add support for specifying attributes for per cpu declarations (preserves
  IA64 model(small) attribute).
  - Drop first patch that removes the model(small) attribute for IA64
  - Missing #endif in powerpc generic config /  Wrong Kconfig
  - Follow Randy's suggestions on how to do the Kconfig settings
V2->V3:
  - fix x86_64 non-SMP case
  - change SHIFT_PTR to SHIFT_PERCPU_PTR
  - fix various percpu_modcopy()'s to reference correct per_cpu_offset()
  - s390 has a special way to determine the pointer to a per cpu area
V3->V4:
  - rebased patchset on 2.6.24-rc6-mm1
    (removes the percpu_modcopy changes that are already in.)
  - change config ARCH_SETS_UP_PER_CPU_AREA to a global var
    and use select HAVE_SETUP_PER_CPU_AREA to specify.
