  That depends mainly on question:  Does your stack grow up or down ?
  Machines where stack grows up are a bit rare, but they do exist.
  The CISC archetype, IBM S/360/370/390 has simple instruction to
  add a small positive offset value into pointer register, but not
  to substract it (nor have negative offsets). Thus most stackfull
  languages there have the stack growing up.  Doing downwards-growing
  stack setup requires 1 extra register use, and one extra instruction
  per frame entry, plus considerably more for parameter push.
  (But it was a great beast to run Fortran-IV which didn't need stack,
   just subfunction invocation record -- at a static location unique
   for each subfunction --> no recursion supported.)

   For things like lone pointer referral with pre/post inc/dec:
	*p++
   it is well defined, but for things like:
	*p++ + *p
   it is not.  (Will the second *p be evaluated before or after *p++
   post-increment ?)
