nits:
1) I'm not sure the "no-op if CONFIG_CSA not set" comments
   are worthwhile - it does not seem to be a common practice
   to mark macros that collapse under certain CONFIG's with
   such comments, and some code, such as in fork.c, would
   become quite a bit less readable if such comments were
   widely used.
2) Three of the added csa_update_integrals() lines have
   leading spaces, instead of a tab char, such as in:

3) Is it always the case that csa_update_integrals() and
   update_mem_hiwater() are used together?  If so, perhaps
   they could be collapsed into one?  Even the current->mm
   test inside them could be made one test, perhaps?
4) What kind of kernel text size expansion does this cause?
   There seem to be about a dozen of these calls.  What are
   the pros and cons of inlining csa_update_integrals() and
   update_mem_hiwater()?  Are these on hot enough kernel code
   paths that we should benchmark with and without these hooks
   enabled, both inline and out-of-line?
