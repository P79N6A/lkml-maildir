Jan Beulich pointed out some problems with this:
- First NMI vector is always 2 in the x86 architecture, so calling
another vector NMI_VECTOR is misleading.
- And when an NMI is forced in ICR the x86 architecture specifies
that the interrupt is delivered to vector 2.
Intel IA32  vol 3 8-23:

So how did this ever work?  I suspect you just got reentered
via the hooks in the NMI handler, but never through this vector.
I think I'll just remove this unless someone can explain how
it is supposed to work.
Thanks,
