To explain, since this issue has caused much talk already.
Most of the network code is non-modular: this means that it's
convenient and easy to have all the symbols exported in one place.
The netfilter code is modular, and some of those modules export
symbols.  This means that those files *must* export the symbols
themselves when they are modular.  I didn't appreciate this before,
and hence my screwy patch to pre5 which caused the problem (I'm
travelling at the moment, so I use User Mode Linux to test, which has
its own features 8).
It would be possible to do in net/netsyms.c:
	#ifdef CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK
	EXPORT_SYMBOL(...);
	#endif
And then in the file itself:
	#ifdef MODULE
	EXPORT_SYMBOL(...);
	#endif
But that is horribly redundant; simply EXPORT_SYMBOL all the time in
the file itself (and make sure it's listed in *X_OBJS in the Makefile,
so it gets magic'ed by the build system).
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
