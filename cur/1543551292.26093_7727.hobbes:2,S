Partly because I haven't had time to look at it, partly because I'm
not sure if it's needed (why, exactly?), and partly because I've
recently moved house and (STILL!) don't have IP access at home (not
even dialup) so I can't really look at stuff yet :-( :-( :-(
BTW: I'm away at conferences for the next two weeks, so don't expect
fast responses.
