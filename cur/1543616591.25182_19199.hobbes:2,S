I agree, but I think it would be better to do this one step at a time. 
 Let's get the things in the kernel working first to get rid of the 
namespace crash, then get the bootloaders to share the code.  I can't 
test out a lot of the code, so I can't really do the bootloader changes, 
and the bootloader changes are completely independent, anyway, once zlib 
is moved.
