it makes things a lot more complex for both the user and the
infrastructure though, and I doubt it's going to be a performance gain;
you need to walk all registered items anyway to decide the new minimum
value if you unregister one for example.

Actually it's designed in part FOR this case!
So how that will work (thought experiment, I don't have the code yet)
In idle, determine the time the next scheduled event is.
Then given that time go over the C-states and pick the deepest C-state
that
1) satisfies the requested latency
2) has a latency that is a small enough fraction of the total time
(2 is needed to not pick a 1 msec-latency C state for a 1ms idle, that
won't save you power most likely, so you need to have enough time in
"real" idle)
so when you know your latency requirements, you now can pick a DEEPER
sleepstate than you could before (or at least the right one)... dynticks
needs this more than anything :)
