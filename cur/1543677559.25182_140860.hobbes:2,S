Hi list,
I tried to use a program that up until now solely talked to
modems connected to the serial port to talk to a Siemens U10
UMTS mobile connected to a USB port.
The device open failed because the program called open(2) with
the NO_CTTY flag set. Without this flag everything works as
expected.
Should this be considered a buglet? And if so, where?
Regards
  Joerg
