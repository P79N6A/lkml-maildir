well, the kernel needs some 'proof' that a task is interactive, before it
gives it special attention.
the scheduler will give newly started up tasks some credit (if the parent
is interactive), but if they take too long to start up then there is
nothing it can do but to penalize them.

there is a way: renicing. Either use nice +19 on the compilation job or
use nice -5 on the 'known good' tasks. Perhaps we should allow a nice
decrease of up to -5 from the default level - and things like KDE or Gnome
could renice interactive tasks, while things like compilation jobs would
run on the default priority.
