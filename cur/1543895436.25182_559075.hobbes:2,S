The best way to maintain such a subsystem tag most be supported by
kbuild. So say we have the subsystem "scsi" then we can set this subsystem
tag in drivers/scsi/Makefile and let drivers/scsi/arm/Makefile inherit
this vaule doing nothing.
Addign the subsystem tag to the printk could than be done using the
C preprocessor and we are all fine.
If we go by the kernel-doc way to document kernel messages (the few that
actually needs additional explanation) then we need to teach kernel-doc
to collect the same subsystem tag but that should be doable.
