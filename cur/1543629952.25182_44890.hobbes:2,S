   filemap_nopage and shmem_nopage do flush_page_to_ram before returning
   page, but do_no_page also does flush_page_to_ram on any page it slots
   into the user address space.  It's memory.c's business, remove it from
   shmem and filemap (and cut outdated comment from when filemap copied).
Wrong, consider the case where we do early COW in do_no_page, you miss
a flush on the new-new page.
Please don't apply this patch.
