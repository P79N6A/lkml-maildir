My impression is that NT_TASKSTRUCT has failed to define what actually appears
in the note, as the kernel task_struct is not designed to be exported to
user space, and can change without warning.
Hmm.  NT_TASKSTRUCT feels like an information leak although I haven't
a clue what kernel information you could leak that would be interesting
enough that you could compromise the kernel.  It looks like we should
export NT_TASKSTRUCT until we can decide what goes there.

Agreed.  I was trying too hard to reuse what was already there.
