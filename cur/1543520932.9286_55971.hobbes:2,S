And it is probably not best practice to spin down SCSI disks often. 
Unlike IDE disks, SCSI disks are targetted at the server market where
disks are ideally running 24 hours a day.  
The average amount of spin downs before disk failure is therefore
usually a lot smaller than for IDE disks, so it's possible to lose the
disk after a year of idle spin downs (say, 10 times a day?).
This might have changed with current disks where IDE and SCSI versions
are identical except for the electronics (as heard in another thread
here on linux-kernel).
