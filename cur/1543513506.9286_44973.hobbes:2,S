Hello,
i am missing noblink in the Linux kernel. Noblink is a routine which
stops the cursor from blinking in the normal console (not under X) by
making it look like the cursor under X-Windows. And it also allows the 
user to chose different colors for the cursor.
This topic has been brought to this list around 1996 (check the
archive for more) but the thread somehow died without any result.
Noblink is a very nice feature, not only for laptops.
Currently, there seem to be several different versions of noblink out
there, all of them for different kernel versions and all of them
outdated.
I have the patches for 2.0.20, pre2.0.31 and 2.0.33. If anyone would
be willing to add noblink support to the current kernel (as
configuration option), i could send those (they are small) to him.
But this feature should definitely make it into the kernel.
Bye, Kasi
PS: One could argue that setterm is supposed to disable the blinking but
    at least on my system (2.2.10), "setterm -blink off" has no effect.
