I think this is connected to a problem people have been reporting on the
Linux audio lists.  With some USB chipsets, USB audio interfaces just
don't work.  There are dropouts even at very high latencies.  It appears
that interrupts are being disabled for many milliseconds.  PREEMPT_RT
does not help the problem.  We have pretty much decided it has to be the
kernel's fault.  The problem should be fixable because it seems to work
on the other OS.
Maybe we can isolate it to a certain USB chipsets.  I'll try to get more
info.
