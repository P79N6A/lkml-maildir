Upside down?

Sorry. Forgot about this. I liked it for solving the SMP problem, but IIRC, 
we're downing other cpus before this now, so that issue has gone away. I 
should check whether I'm right there.

I'm not suggesting treating them as unfreezeable in the fullest sense. I 
still signal them, but don't mind if they don't respond. This way, if they 
do leave that state for some reason (timeout?) at some point, they still 
get frozen.

I've been surprised that you haven't already seen them while eating memory 
such that filesystems come into play. Perhaps you guys only use swap 
partitions, and something like a swapfile with some memory pressure might 
trigger this? Or it could be a side effect of one of the other changes.
