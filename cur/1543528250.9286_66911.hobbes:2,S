we do
map = follow_page(ptr);
to convert the userspace vaddr to a struct page *. right ?
where is it converted to a kernel virtual address ? if ptr already was a
kernel address, then we should have simply done
map = mem_map +  MAP_NR(ptr).
then we do
map = get_page_map(map, ptr);
and now we pass this to get_page_map() which promptly returns 0, so
map = 0.
it's quite easy to hit this, just try reading a raw device.
