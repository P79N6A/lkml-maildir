Well, you just build usually monolithic kernels, so you skip this problem.
And an idea that likely netkit uses is taking modules through an hostfs mount 
(or, it would be an easier setup). But you need modules to have uid 0...

You found 2.4 images, but 2.6 ones do exist.

Hmm... I'd think we need a wizard for configuration. Plus some distro-like 
work for some specific issues - if I want to deploy a VM with hostname x, 
network config y, and with Xnest running, I need an easier way to do that.
You can add settings on kernel command line and parse them inside UML - we 
need standard packaged utilities for that (one of the rootfs builder 
installed such stuff).

The runtime kit is there on nagafix.co.uk. The devkit is a main idea - most of 
the work is to put something on the UML wiki and market well the idea - 
creating such an image would be easy. But I haven't clear what you're talking 
about - kernel development (why sources inside) or userspace development?
Also integrating all possible debug stuff would be useful, but I don't know 
what's needed.

We need three things:
a) more performance
b) more users
c) more developers
a) leads to c), and b) too.

No, it's not dumb. I'm even wanting to have a "Vmware-like" interface. Or at 
least standard scripts for guest management.

uml.nagafix.co.uk has some good kernels + images. With compression, they're 
even as little as 50 Mb.
However, making UML easier to use, and marketing it for more application, is 
very important. Various project do exist but they're not integrated, and they 
do not try to (netkit is for network experimentation, but is also better as 
VM management tool).
In short, we'd need somebody helping out really with the website (there is the 
wiki but you must request an account via email, and it's not the main 
website), with uml-utilities, and with new uml-utilities (you know 
dm-snapshot is a faster COW? Something to setup it automatically would be 
good).
There would be more to say on this, but I can't right now (I've other stuff to 
do).
