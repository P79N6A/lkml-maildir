Subject: 5 compile errors for 2.4-BK
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

every day my scripts compile several kernel from the latest -BK tree,
since oct, 30. there are 5 compile errors shown in:
make[3]: [neighbour.o] Error 1 (ignored)
make[3]: [core.o] Error 1 (ignored)
make[3]: [arp.o] Error 1 (ignored)
make[3]: [ipv4.o] Error 1 (ignored)
make[1]: [first_rule] Error 2 (ignored)
[and that's why these 2 occur too:]
make: [vmlinux] Error 1 (ignored)
make: [zImage] Error 2 (ignored)
full make logs, configs here:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/sheep/latest-kernel/
  - make-2.4-i386-BK.log
  - make-2.4-ppc-BK.log
  - errors-2.4-i386-BK.log
  - errors-2.4-ppc-BK.log
  - config-i386-2.4.28-rc1
  - config-ppc-2.4.28-rc1
this is all with debian/unstable, using gcc-3.4.2, binutils-2.15 (both 
for native i386-compiler and cross-compiler)
maybe someone may find this useful...
thanks,
Christian.
