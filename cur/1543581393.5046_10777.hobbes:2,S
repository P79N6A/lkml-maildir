Please CC me, as I don't follow the list.
Please also forgive me if I'm stepping on toes.  I'm in user-space.
I have had similar problems (network server XXXX not responding) with
both a Netgear FA311 (DP83815) and a Macronix (tulip) card when using
Donald Becker's drivers under 2.2.x  kernels when connected to a Netgear
FE108 (100BaseTx-HD) hub.  Both work correctly when dumbed-down to
10Mb.  The fa311 driver from Netgear worked fine at 100Mb with a 2.2
kernel.
Under 2.4.x, fa311 doesn't compile and natsemi.c gives the messages
below.  Again, I can (and do) force the card to 10Mb and it works fine
with the natsemi driver.
