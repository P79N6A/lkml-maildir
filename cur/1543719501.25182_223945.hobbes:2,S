you should bring that to netdev@oss.sgi.com instead of lkml.
IF the ioctl has really changed, then it would be a bug. I just played
with ipconfig from the klibc distribution, and it returns only
interfaces in UP state. I'm sure that ipconfig binary worked when the
code was written.
If the ioctl is supposed to work how it does in 2.6, there is still
/sys/class/net/*. Thats (probably) more reliable than a text parser.
See `nameif -r 'foo: bar' eth0` as example.
