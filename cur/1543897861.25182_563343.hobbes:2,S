It is not so trivial to implement properly. Note that CPU_UP creates a new
cwq->thread, so somehow workqueue should "remember" its priority. This means
we should record it in workqueue_struct. The most simple way is to add yet
another parameter to __create_workqueue(), but this is nasty.
So, perhaps we should add "long nice" to "struct workqueue_struct", and then
	void set_workqueue_nice(struct workqueue_struct *wq, long nice)
	{
		const cpumask_t *cpu_map = wq_cpu_map(wq);
		struct cpu_workqueue_struct *cwq;
		int cpu;
		wq->nice = nice;
		mutex_lock(&workqueue_mutex);
		for_each_cpu_mask(cpu, *cpu_map) {
			cwq = per_cpu_ptr(wq->cpu_wq, cpu);
			if (cwq->thread)
				set_user_nice(cwq->thread, nice);
		}
		mutex_unlock(&workqueue_mutex);
	}
We could use for_each_cpu_online() instead, but then we should check
is_single_threaded().
