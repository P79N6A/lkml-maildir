Becides the comments that Todd had about the power management stuff, I
have the following comments:
	- please inline your patches, I can't quote them :(
	- you create the DEVICE_ATTR macro, why not use the one already
	  created for you (CLASS_DEVICE_ATTR will work I think.)
	- Don't do a unregister function by passing a string to it.
	  Explicitly pass the pointer of the object that you want to
	  unregister, like all other kernel interfaces do.  With that
	  change you no longer need the class_find_device() patch,
	  right?
	- How about some drivers that actually use this interface?
	  Again, you are creating interfaces with no examples of users
	  of the interface, which isn't acceptable.
thanks,
