I hate to jump in like this, but I noticed something while compiling
madwifi as well with
gcc, I'm wondering if this is related to the above:
/home/name/Desktop/madwifi-trunk-r3574-20080426/Makefile:50
Makefile.inc: no such file or directory
even though the files exists,
Makefile.inc98: scripts/get_arch.mk: no such file or directory
Makefile.inc:102 ath_hal/ah_target.inc: no such file or directory
Makefile.inc:163 *** TARGET i386-elf is invalid, invalid target are: . Stop.
make[1] *** [modules] Error 2
After modifying the  Makefiles you're left with ***TARGET i386-elf problem
