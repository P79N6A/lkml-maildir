This is just a silly remove-unneeded-cast-of-void* cleanup.  I wrote this
as a fixup against
libata-add-irq_flags-to-struct-pata_platform_info.patch with the intention
of folding it into that base patch, but you went and merged the submitter's
original patch so this trivial fixup got stranded in -mm.  Feel free to give
it the piss-off-too-trivial treatment.

Oh, I thought these were the patches which affected scsi and which James
had issues with.  I guess I got confused.

3x59x-fix-pci-resource-management.patch: you wrote it ;) I have a comment
here:
- I don't remember the story with cardbus either.  Presumably once upon a
  time the cardbus layer was claiming IO regions on behalf of cardbus
  devices (?)
Need to think about that.
update-smc91x-driver-with-arm-versatile-board-info.patch:
See comment from rmk in changelog:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.22-rc6/2.6.22-rc6-mm1/broken-out/update-smc91x-driver-with-arm-versatile-board-info.patch
Deepak, can we move this along a bit please?
drivers-net-ns83820c-add-paramter-to-disable-auto.patch:
See comments in changelog: 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.22-rc6/2.6.22-rc6-mm1/broken-out/drivers-net-ns83820c-add-paramter-to-disable-auto.patch
Dan, Ben: is there any prospect of progress here?

Spose so.  But it's buried in the middle of a series of four patches.

The first few patches will a) fix up our writev performance regression and
b) reintroduce the writev() deadlock which the writev()-regresion-adding
patch fixed.
So it's all a bit ugly.

OK, thanks.
