Perhaps because we aren't having many problems with it.

Probably more to the point is that not only is XFS used by
many but has been part of distro kernels for some time.

The fewer patches, particularly feature patches the distros
have to add the less painful it would be to try a different
kernel or change distros.
That said, if XFS is wanted in Linux it should become a
Linux native and not be dependant on IRIX APIs just so SGI
engineers can use an unmodified common codebase.  I agree
wholeheartedly with Marcello on that point.
<OT>
As a datapoint i'm running ext2, reiserfs, JFS and XFS each
for different reasons.
	ext2 -- boot (i'm stodgy) and 2kb blocks for archive CDs
	reiserfs3 -- filesystems not exported nfs (no
	historical version level that i can confirm whether
	i have or not will namesys assert is reliable over
	nfs)
	jfs -- most nfs exported filesystems, decent
	performance and solid but i don't use if for home
	because in SuSE's 2.4.18 (i know it is ancient but
	solid for me) jfs doesn't update mtime of
	directories unless the block allocation changes
	breaking maildir update detection.
	xfs -- home (because of the jfs bug) Earlier tests
	of xfs gave me horrible performance and i haven't
	gotten around to testing since then.  If this is
	fixed without tuning i might drop jfs.  Then again i
	may drop xfs in the next upgrade if i change distros
	and xfs isn't in-kernel.
