megaraid, i2o, 3ware, aacraid all also drive IDE devices too now
Promise new driver is using the scsi layer as well (because they do
command queuing as well as drive tagged queue stuff). I've been 
hacking on the SI stuff a bit and its also apparent our IDE PATA
layer won't support that well in a hurry either since it also
has command buffering.
