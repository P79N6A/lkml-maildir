How would it know? If you can answer that question, you have made
the tool. It would be specific to your module. FYI, in designing
such a tool, you often the find the leak, which means you don't
need the tool anymore.
I would start by temporarily putting a wrapper around whatever you
use for memory allocation and deallocation. The wrapper code keeps
track of pointer values and outstanding allocations. If the outstanding
allocations grow or if the pointers to whatever_free() are different
than the pointers to whatever_alloc(), you have a leak. You can read
the results from a private ioctl().
