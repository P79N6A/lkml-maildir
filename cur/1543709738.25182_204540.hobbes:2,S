I'm aiming for a situation where I can build external modules,
using an almost clean kernel src tree.
Which means that my "make clean on steroids" patch maybe is a bit
too effective.
The distintion point could be:
make clean leaves only enough to build external modules.
Otherwise we need a third (fourth) cleaning target, which is not desireable.
