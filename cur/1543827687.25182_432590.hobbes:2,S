I agree that this is misleading.
My original preference was to use ksock_ prefix for all these wrapper
functions. But just to be consistent with the existing kernel_sendmsg
and kernel_recvmsg, i used kernel_ prefix.
If it is OK, i could rename them also to use the ksock_ prefix to make
them all consistent and also indicating that we are operating on sockets.
If not, i will go with kernel_sock_ioctl().
Thanks
