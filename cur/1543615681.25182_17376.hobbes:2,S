See:

To break reservations from a crippled SCSI initiator, the
other initiator needs access to a SCSI bus reset. Even
though the sg driver supports this, the SCSI mid-level
support is missing in the standard lk 2.4 series. Many
distributions have the required patch (from James
Bottomley) that makes SCSI bus reset functional.
That SCSI bus reset mid-level patch for the lk 2.5 series
will be heading in Jens's direction shortly.
