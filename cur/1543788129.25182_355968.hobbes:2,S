The ugly implementation (inside the kernel and as a big file instead of doing it as a
userspace in top of NTFS files which would have helped them to avoid lots of problems
that they were forced to solve in XP/2003, it's clear from their docs that they didn't
expected that registry could grow _so_ much), the fact that they use it to store at
the same time userspace configuration and internal kernel structures. The "idea" is
nice but the way they've implemented and used it is horrible - just take a look
at how they're using XML configuration files for IIS now... (I've been said that ISS will
detect when you're editing those configuration files and will reload them to duplicate
the changes you just made in the registry ..... ugh)

right - why you would want to do such thing is another story
