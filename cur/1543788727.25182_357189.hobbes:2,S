presumption is not always good, and it is very clear. Most of the 
flamewars blaze up because of that. Anyway let's not hover on that ..

I do agree that indentation is not so good, but how would you suggest 
the code be wrapped ?
The problem with wrapping is that readability goes down horribly, but 
while debugging a driver, this is too painful.
Considering that it has a long way to go still..

Well i am using it in mantis_dma.c, pci_alloc/free
You mean rather than saving off the pointer, i do a pci_get_dev()
and later on in the exit routine, i do a pci_dev_put() .. ?

Any thoughts as to why ? I am not saying it is not needed, but i would 
like to know what was the idea.
