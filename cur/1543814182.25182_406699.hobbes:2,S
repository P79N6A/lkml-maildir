This reminds me, what the hell ever happened to ORMAP?  That object
based rmap thingy I tried out in one of wli's patches made my system
boot like 3 times faster.  There were other cool things going on that I
never got to try too, never saw that all out to fruition.
Status on some of the elements in the old 2.6-wli series from around
there would be nice.  I'm curious as to what has gone in.
