I'm still not quite sure why the patches you sent didn't apply
for me.  Why don't you send refreshed patches to me after RC1.

Yes, various cleanup patches.  Missing newlines in dev_*() calls,
class_device removal, remove extra includes, and so forth.  They
might conflict with your patches (I suspect they won't).
That's a big part of why you should arrange to submit patches well
in advance of the merge window opening.  As a rule, maintainers
won't have/make extra time during that window to review and/or fix
nontrivial issues, or address conflicts with other patches.  Try to
submit at least a few weeks before the previous kernel finalizes.
