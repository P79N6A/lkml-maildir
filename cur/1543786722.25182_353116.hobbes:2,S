Except that the (time) range of the list would be limited I don't really 
see a big difference.
Anyway, the biggest cost is the conversion from/to the 64bit ns value and 
if its main use is sorting, you can use something like this:
typedef union {
	u64 tv64;
	struct {
#ifdef __BIG_ENDIAN
		u32 sec, nsec;
#else
		u32 nsec, sec;
#endif
	} tv;
} ktimespec;
To compare two time values the tv64 value is sufficient.
bye, Roman
