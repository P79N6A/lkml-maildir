Well I think more threads ~= more probability that this guy is going to
be preempted while holding the mutex?
This might be why FreeBSD works much better, because it looks like MySQL
actually will set RT scheduling for those processes that take critical
resources.

I would agree that it points to MySQL scalability issues, however the
fact that such large gains come from tcmalloc is still interesting.
