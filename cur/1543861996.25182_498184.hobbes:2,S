Unfortunately the adapter has been sitting idle in an antistat bag for
some time, and last time I used it was with a Debian Sarge install. I
can try some older Ubuntu LiveCD's (will take some time to download
though) and try and get a point in time where it works.

Many thanks for the patch. Applied to 2.6.20-rc4, built as K7-SMP, but
unfortunately it behaves no different compared to stock 2.6.20-rc4. If
you have any other ideas, I am game for some testing. Meanwhile, I'll
grab some LiveCD's to get data-points.
Cheers!
