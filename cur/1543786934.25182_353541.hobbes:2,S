Hello all,
I was trying to do some performance monitoring using performance counters 
on an AMD Athlon64. I am trying to count number of retired uops (0xC1h) 
and I want to call a function after every n number of uops. I think I need 
to use APIC for this purpose and specifically APIC register for 
"perfromance counter local vector table entry" in which i can set up the 
vector which will be sent for the interrupt source. Now I am not familiar 
with setting up of vector table entries and the detailed process of how 
can I do what I want. Can anyone give some pointers where I can find more 
information on programming APIC with performance-monitoring counters or if 
some one can explain it to me, I would be thankful.
TIA
