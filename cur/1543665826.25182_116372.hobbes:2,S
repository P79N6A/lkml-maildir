Thanks for the help Martin.  It looks like that was the problem.  The
kernel mdstat statistics must have been overwriting some other kernel
memory and giving me my panics.  With the help of Kevin's 2.5 patch I
patched the Red Hat 2.4.18-26 md code to use seq_file and now my big
RAID arrays are syncing and I haven't had a panic yet :D
Thanks again to everyone for the help.  I'll submit the patch to the
linux-raid list as md-seq_file-2.4.18-26.7.x.patch if anyone's
interested.
Regards,
Andy.

At a wild guess (OK, I only looked for about 1 minute),
md_status_read_proc is generating more than 4K of information, and
overwriting the end of it's 4K page. Throw some debug in there, and get
it to printk how much of the buffer it thinks it's using (just printk sz
every time it changes it). If it's > 4K, convert it to the seq_file
interface.
May not be it, but it seems likely given the unusual scale of what
you're doing, and it's easy to check.
