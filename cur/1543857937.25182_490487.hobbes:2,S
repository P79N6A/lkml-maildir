Subject: [PATCH] input: Extend raw mode to work up to keycode 0xFF

Hi, [please CC me, as I am not subscribed]
currently keycodes above 240 are ignored if the tty is in raw mode. To make the key codes from 241 to 255 usable for programs in raw mode (like X11) the still unused scancodes were 
added into that range. Right know these scancodes are used in arbitrary order due the lack of a better alternative. Comments on a better way of using them are welcome.
This extension is needed for some keycodes I submited in a previous patch.
Florian
