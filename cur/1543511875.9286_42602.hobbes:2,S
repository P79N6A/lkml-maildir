Indeed. I also think that we have a big problem here.

It seems to happen more frequently on Celeron systems than any other. Maybe
because teh Celeron on die cache runs at CPU speed, i.e. is faster?

Right! The 'upgrader' was me. Sad but true yesterday kernel 2.2.13pre14 with
hedrick's ide patches for pre14 also froze :( The only difference so far it
seems was that the notebook that the kernel ran on was running on batteries
yesterday. Normally I have AC power connected and everything worked
perfectly well for more than three days with it.
Since it seems to be a timing problem I had some thoughts about this issue.
Doesn't the APM BIOS signal some kind of event when battery charging changes
are detected? Maybe those 'signals' have been the reason for some weird
timing changes and the freezes I experienced yesterday.

I have the impression that right after the freeze my harddisk seems to
timeout on some started transfer because any time the machine froze I heard
a little 'click' (head movement) just a second after the freeze.
Interestingly the freezes _never_ happen during e2fsck on startup but at any
point after that.

Some time ago I tried Win NT on the same machine and NT once dumped
bluescreen right after boot. The screen said something about an unhandled
interrupt 0x1f. So I browsed through the Linux kernel to see where 0x1f is
handled and found some code for initialization of higher interrupts for the
APIC used on SMP machines. So I compiled for SMP in the hope that this could
a cure but the follwing SMP kernel did also freeze some time later :(

I have the impression that the freeze show up more frequently after some
time of constant hdd access; in my case I was playing audio files for some
time, i.e. the buffer cache is almost full.
And when then doing something completely different like changing a directory
using bash's TAB completion the freeze occurs. This happened several times
now.
