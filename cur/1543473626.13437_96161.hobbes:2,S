Alan,
        The ac4 patches indeed fixed the oops problem I was getting on boot
during the Partition Check, but there are still some problems.
1. My parport IOMEGA zip drive is unaccessable from 2.2.0 (it's not being
detected as it normally is by 2.0 and 2.1)
2. pppd-2.3.5 seems to have forgotten how to properly negotiate for an IP (I am
not sure this is kernel related, but I did try recompiling it booted in 2.2.0
with no luck) (also note, I did not apply the kernel patches that come with
ppp-2.3.5 as we know that they normally break the kernel anyway.)

Things you may or may not want to know:
Intel P200
64MB RAM
Everything worked great with 2.0.x and 2.1.x ;)
Kernel .config: (hope this isn't bothersome.)
