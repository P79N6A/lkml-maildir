we picked up all of your patches - have you checked the x86.git#testing 
branch, or only the x86.git#mm branch? We started x86.git#testing 
recently, it includes more bleeding-edge stuff and wider, cross-tree 
features as well.

We've got that one queued up in x86.git#testing as well. Someone on lkml 
having concerns is not a basis to not deal with a patch. What matters 
is: are those concerns well-founded? If you do not agree with the 
concerns then just indicate it to us when re-submitting but do not drop 
patches. Your patches have a good track record so please do not let 
yourself get scared away from contributing. Please do not keep patches 
in your local tree, we'd like Linux to work fine out of box, on as broad 
range of hardware as possible.
