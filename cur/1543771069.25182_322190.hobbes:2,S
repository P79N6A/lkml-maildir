Then in that case you have doubled your memory bandwidth
requirement for those cachelines.

The principle of locality-of-data (ie. the reason why caches
even work) says that you do ;)
Clearly some things benefit from not going through the cache.
But I don't think we should fundamentally change behaviour of
this *just* because it is worth a percent on kernel compiles.
Also, I think that trends in CPU design (more cache, further
from memory, multiple CPUs & cores) should favour stores
going to cache rather than straight to memory... But I'm
just speculating.
