	I thought that I was going crazy or that it was just my
	inability to configure things correctly, but it is kind of
	comforting to see that I'm not the only one seeing problems
	with XFree86 4.0.2 + matrox + kernel 2.2.18 (UP system -- an
	AMD Duron with chipset KT133).
	When X 4.0.2 entered the Debian testing distribution, I
	immediately upgraded (I had used X 4.0.1 before with very good
	results, but that system had an HD crash and I reinstalled
	Debian potato, that comes with X 3.3.6). I got all these
	strange Segfaults and crashes with a vanilla 2.2.18 kernel. I
	went back to X 3.3.6 and everything is running perfectly fine
	since then, but I'd like to use the new features of X 4.
	[]s, Roger...
