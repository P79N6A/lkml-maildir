Hello,
I'm using linux 2.2.15 kernel on redhat.
I have added some variables (pointers) on "sock" data structure.
I was initializing them to NULL in sk_alloc() function.
But it seems some sock structures are allocated for TCP bypassing this
sk_alloc() and due to this my added pointers are not initialized to NULL
all the time.
Can anyone tell me which function is being called for generating sock
for TCP connections ( I guess for a aprticular TCP packet type, not for
all, as I'm getting into this problem intermittently, esp., when I try
access some specified website from my PC) ?
Thanks
