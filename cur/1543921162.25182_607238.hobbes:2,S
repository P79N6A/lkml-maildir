Ok,I agree to use AHCI driver for our AHCI controllers no matter their
class codes are IDE/RAID/AHCI. But for those new or upcoming AHCI
controller which DIDs are not included in ahci.c and also IDE/RAID
mode being set in BIOS, no driver will be loaded currently, so I hope
the first patch 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/8/93
 can be appied for
this case. Any comments?
