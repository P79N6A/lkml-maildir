This is not a valid reason.
This clearly fixes a bug in linux. Note: the irq disable
is local to ide-cs. Are you paranoid enough to believe
enabling the irq by writing globally to the control register that
existed since ATA will have ill effects? 
You claim the relevant PCMCIA ATA behaviour is not ATA(>3?) compliant,
however you didn`t yet give any facts to support this !
You claim this locks the driver, again no facts.

The proposed patch is very simple (as per Linus' liking). When considering to
install an earlier (and  global) irq handler I believe you can see
this will impose a much greater risk !
