LSM use another way of doing similar things :-) I'm
not sure that it is nice to forward system calls back
to userspace where they came from in the first place
:-) VXE use high level language to create security
models.
And what are the problems with technology used by VXE?
File permissions are checked in the kernel and
everybody are happy with that. VXE just extends
security features already available in the kernel.
There is a historic part to all that, too - VXE was
created (1999) before SELinux was available.
