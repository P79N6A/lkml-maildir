Hi everyone,
I'm having the following issue using linux 2.6.6 compiled for ppc64 on a
single 1.8GHz G5 that is triggered by kudzu.A photo of the backtrace is
available at 
http://cvs.terraplex.com/~owen/s3000018.jpg
 The strace
output is available at 
http://cvs.terraplex.com/~owen/kudzu.strace.
 It
appears to be doing something with tg3 which the machine has but I could
be totally wrong. I should also note that 2.6.6-rc3 works fine.
Sincerly,
Owen
