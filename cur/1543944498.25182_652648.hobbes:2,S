Good grief ... I'm not lobbying for separate flag fields because the
space is there.  I was just dealing with one possible obection, by
noting that it wouldn't cost us in terms of struct mempolicy size.

This gets closer to the key issue.
We both agree we want "simpler", but disagree on what that means.
We don't measure complexity -solely- by counting the size of parameter lists.
If we did that, we'd be packing all manner of sub-integer fields into single
'int' parameters.
I tend to measure complexity a level up from the bits and bytes,
and more in terms of how I think about things.  If I think of a routine
as taking two values, such as in this case an mempolicy mode (such as
MPOL_BIND or MPOL_INTERLEAVE) and this new flag (MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES),
which have a different sort of affect.
==> If each time I look at some 'flags' field, I have to think of it
as a couple of things glued together that I will have to pick apart to
use, that's more mental work than seeing those two things explicit and
separate, through most of the mempolicy.c code <==
