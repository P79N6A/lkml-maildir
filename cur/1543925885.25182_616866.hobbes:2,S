Subject: [RFC 0/3] Linux Kernel Markers new features
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew,
Those are the new features I plan to add to the Markers :
- Support multiple probes per marker (so blktrace, LTTng, SystemTAP and others
  can coexist peacefully)
- Export the markers to a Module.markers file in modpost (for Systemtap)
- Use the Immediate values to optimize the branch when disabled.
I depends on the "Immediate Values" patchset and applies on top of
2.6.24-rc2-git3 in this order :
#RFC
markers-support-multiple-probes.patch
linux-kernel-markers-create-modpost-file.patch
linux-kernel-markers-immediate-values.patch
I submit those as a RFC for now.
Mathieu
