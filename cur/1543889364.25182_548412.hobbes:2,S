Paul Jackson is the cpuset guru.

According to Paul's comment in kernel/cpuset.c
 * It is ok to first take manage_sem, then nest callback_sem.  We also
 * require taking task_lock() when dereferencing a tasks cpuset pointer.
So I'm afraid it is not safe to call guarantee_online_cpus(tsk->cpuset, &mask);
without it.  Could the task not be exiting?

Right, the lock is released but I indeed didn't reenable irqs.
How would you suggest doing that?  The irq state was saved in local
variable "flags" back in migration_call().
