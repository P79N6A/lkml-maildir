Something's busted with forcedeth in 2.6.20-rc6-mm3 for me relative to 
2.6.20-rc6. There's no errors in dmesg, but it seems no packets ever get 
received and so the machine can't get an IP address. I tried reverting 
all the -mm changes to drivers/net/forcedeth.c, which didn't help. The 
network controller shares an IRQ with the USB OHCI controller which is 
receiving interrupts, so it doesn't seem like an interrupt routing 
problem, though I suppose something wierd could be happening there.
This is on an Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe (CK804 chipset) on x86_64.
Any suggestions on how to debug/what to try reverting to see what's 
causing this?
