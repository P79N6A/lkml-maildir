I'm sure it's just something silly that's hurt the performance of the
af_packet module (perhaps already fixed, perhaps in my methodology :|)
For the purposes of the work I was doing here (totally unrelated to this
Magic Lantern BS, which I didn't even know what it was until after I posted
the first response in this thread), I just needed to saturate a gigE link for
testing. To do this I just used three boxes flooding UDP packets and that
worked. As far as traffic collection goes (which is what I was testing),
we went with another approach-- an optical tap to snarf off a copy of all
the data on a link, and then a custom kernel I hacked up to do the work
in the kernel itself (avoiding the kernel--user space copy and the stack
entirely). This is not for the faint of heart.
