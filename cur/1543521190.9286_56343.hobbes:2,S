Attached are two patches for token ring for 2.3.36. One is for the new
source routing code and the other is for the IPv6 stuff.
The source routing code change is some *major* stuff, but it has been
extensively tested over several months by the token ring community.
DJ / Jochen - I would appreciate it if you could check the patches
against
your original code for completeness.
These files are also available on the web-site.
