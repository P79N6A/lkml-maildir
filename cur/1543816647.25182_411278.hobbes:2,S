These are part of the eCryptfs roadmap. I'm not sure when we are
planning to incorperate the functionality to select your hash and
cipher (I believe its 0.2 or 0.3), but we have experimented with this
and have had success doing so. The code is not included in 0.1 due to
lack of testing and conflict with our mental model of the releases.
Should this functionality be high desired / required, I see no reason
why it can't be added, but Mike Halcrow and Phillip need to weight in
on this too :)
