Yes, you've grasped the reason for leaving the old driver in, so people 
can use their computers. Because when there is a new driver for 
previously unsupported hardware people will be glad to put time into 
debugging it to make the hardware useful. But when you take out a 
working driver because you (ie. the responsible developer) have a new 
idea which interests you, users don't want to use it because they have 
something which works, so you take out the working driver to make work 
for the users and create what you call a "better new driver" below.
The old driver wasn't requiring any resources to maintain, the old 
hardware wasn't changing, there was no particular benefit to users in 
breaking their configuration. This disregard for the users just gives 
Linux critics an arguing point, "the next new kernel may withdraw 
support for your hardware." Isn't that why 2.6.16 is still being 
maintained? Nobody (sane) expects new drivers to be perfect, they just 
don't expect the working drivers to be disabled.

"Better" is a very subjective thing, you see elegance of design perhaps, 
I see works or not, and when I have to use statistical methods to see 
latency or CPU overhead benefits, I frankly don't care.
Removing a working driver without a fully functional replacement forces 
people to stop upgrading their kernel, or start maintaining old drivers 
out of line. Problems of the "just occasionally goes away" type can take 
months to debug, the load can't be duplicated in most cases, and there's 
no log or oops data to help.

Where does sky2 come in? Does this mean the the recent suggestion to 
"just change to skge and stop complaining" is also wrong?
