Hello,
i hit a problem with suspend to ram and especially resume.
Hardware: Dell Latitude D810 (some Intel 915 with Intel Pentium M)
With 2.6.19.7 suspend to ram works reliable, but with 2.6.20-rc4
it stopped working reliable.
I still can suspend, but after the first resume it goes back to sleep
directly again, when resuming again it works.
After the second suspend it won't resume at all.
The problem is that i can't try out the kernel versions <rc4, because
rc1, rc2 and rc3 doesn't boot at all, so git-bisect also won't help.
Has somebody an idea what i could try out?
(the distribution is in this case ubuntu feisty)
Regards
Christian Leber
