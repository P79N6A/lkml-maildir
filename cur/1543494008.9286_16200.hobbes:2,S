I reported this to Alan in December; I had connections stuck in CLOSE_WAIT for
a couple of weeks on 2.0.36. I'm not a TCP bod, tho', so I don't know if this
is a bug or a feature.
I quite understandably didn't get a response from Alan - either because
I didn't provide enough info or it just got lost in the huge torrent of email
he no doubt gets each day.
I started poking around in the tcp socket guts but it will no doubt be years
before I get up to speed on it all.
