i dont think this is true. The page-cache corruption is puzzling, but
access_ok() should be enough. If we get a page fault in setup_frame() we
simply refuse to make that page present and return a -EFAULT to
__put_user, without making that write. The process will proceed (it's
slightly ugly that we try all writes in setup_frame(), but it's safe), and
will try to send another signal afterwards, infinitly, looping between
setup_page() and do_signal in the return path, without ever executing
user-space again. The process can still be killed and interrupted.
