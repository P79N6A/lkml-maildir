Simulators can be fixed, even if it takes time; for something like 
clflush this is easier since clflush can be implemented as a simple noop 
for most of them.
I just verified that Bochs 2.3.0 lacks this CPUID bit whereas the 
current version, 2.3.6, enables CLFLUSH iff SSE2 is enabled.  Qemu 0.9.0 
has CLFLUSH.  Andi, do you happen to know of any specific simulators 
which are problematic?  I would assume any recent version of SimNow is 
up to date.
