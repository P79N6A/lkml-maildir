Ah, indeed, you appended Rene's email without too many new lines,
so I thought your wrote it (

).
All right, how would you debug it? Give us some insight in how to solve
hard to trigger, happens at most only a few times a day, annoying input
bug? I thought the mouse warping was fixed after 23-rc1 and that input
locking patch, but alas, the third day it happened again.
I would be happy just to know if it's bad hardware or a software bug,
I don't ask for too much, do I?
Greetings,
Indan
