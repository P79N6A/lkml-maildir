Well, actually one does.  On a normal https server, each https request
results in an operation on the private key.  So if the attacker shares
the same web server as the victim it's probably rather easy for the
attacker to see when the machine is idle and launch an attack giving
him thousands of chances to spy on the victim.
But I do agree that this probably isn't all that serious, for those
who really have secrets to hide, they won't run their https server on
a machine shared with anybody else.
