This is a very generic problem. For example, the Open Clustering Framework
also has a lots of events going back and forth - node membership changes,
distributed locks gained or lost, messages pending etc.
The interesting issue here is that the provider or consumer may be implemented
in kernel or user space depending on the task and the given implementation;
ie, what we would ideally need is a common coherent infrastructure for event
distribution on Linux, as I expect this to be a common task for many
scenarios.
Joe DiMartino of OSDL has developed a very nice Event API (I think) for
user-space (a fixed version with some updates we agreed upon in the last two
weeks is pending), and we are currently evaluating how to interface with the
kernel space.
It would be _very nice_ if someone would pick up the lead wrt to "Event
Processing", so that work is not duplicated between so many (already
overloaded) groups.
Just my few euro-cents.
