I found the original libc-222 sources on an old machine of mine, and I
do believe it originally came off of an old FTP a while back (too far
back for me to remember off hand).  Can be gotten at:
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~stan/linux/libc-222.taz
That is the only 2.x version of libc I have found thus far, in the same
directory I found a bunch of old 4.x and 5.x libc versions as well, if
anyone wants a specific one let me know and I'll post it to the site or
e-mail it directly (I don't have enough web room to post them all atm). 
Not sure, but from the looks of the directory structure I must have got
them mirroring a site back in '97.  Not sure what site though.  I'm
trying to figure that out to see if its mirrored anywhere else.

sb
