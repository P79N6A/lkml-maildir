As long as the X server is running, new clients can connect and shmat()
the segment. Therefore, yes, fd passing will be necessary. It's ugly
to need an AF_UNIX socket in order to use shared memory in a reasonable
way, and it will be ugly inside X because it breaks the transport
abstraction layer present in X, but it will be doable.
