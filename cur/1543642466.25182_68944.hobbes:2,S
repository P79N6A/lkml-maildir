Out of curiosity, and primarily for my own edification, what kind
of optimization does it do when everything is generated by a java/
perl/python/homebrew script and pasted together by something which
consults a content manager.  In a few of the cases that I know of,
there isn't really any static content to cache...  And why is this
something that Apache couldn't/shouldn't be doing?
