I get three-out-of-three rejects in cpuset.c.  I could fix them, but I
wouldn't be very confident that the result works at runtime.  2.6.20-rc6 was
a long time ago - please, always raise patches against the latest mainline
kernel (the daily git snapshot suffices).
Recursion is a big no-no in kernel.  Is there any way in which it can be
avoided?  Is Dinakar's implementation also recursive?
