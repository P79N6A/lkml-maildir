What about this construct:
    /*  Only one reader allowed at any one time  */
    atomic_inc (&read_count);
    if (atomic_read (&read_count) > 1)
    {
	atomic_dec (&read_count);
	return -EBUSY;
    }
    /*  Do work  */
    atomic_dec (&read_count);
    return 0;
If you need blocking operation, replace the return -EBUSY with a
schedule() loop. The only race should be that the resource is
available, then two CPUs enter this region and "lock" it and they both
have to retry. But that doesn't really matter.
