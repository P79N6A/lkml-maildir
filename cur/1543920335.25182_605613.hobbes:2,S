this is a nice option, and since most of the existing userspace code is 
looking for /dev/sd*, /dev/sr*, etc this should be able to work for new 
installs with no userspace changes. Since it would break existing installs 
it would need to be optional.
one other option that could be considered (and I do realize I'm bringing 
up flame-bait here) is that drivers that have fixed addresses could offer 
up a device name that include that address.
i.e. depending on the config option a device could show up as either sda, 
sd-scsi-a, sd-scsi-0:0:0:0, or even sd-scsi-<WWN>
if the driver or bus doesn't have a real numbering, it wouldn't invent a 
fake one (which is a big problem with most of the prior suggestions that 
have tried to offer a numbering option), it would just offer the most 
specific information it has.
