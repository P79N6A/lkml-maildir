Keep in mind that one part of the discussion is to figure out what is
and is not required for adoption by the kernel team. For that, this is
probably the best place to discuss it. Otherwise, it's just the same
tail-chasing that has been going on with the various version control
projects up till now.
Later on, people can just be referred to an existing feature description,
which will cut down on future flamewars on lkml.
Be well,
Zack
