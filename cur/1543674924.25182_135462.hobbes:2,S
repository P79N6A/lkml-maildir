Well, yeah, sure, you can use it to keep track of outstanding requests. 
But wouldn't it be nicer to see them in the first place?
The question being: how do you sanely avoid adding more requests to the 
queue if you start seeing starvation? Or if adding more requests, at least 
using an ordered tag or a barrier or whatever to make sure that you tell 
the disk that the new request must not be done before the old one has 
finally been satisfied?
I think you'd want to see the old requests in order to be able to make 
that decision reasonably well. 
This is clearly not a 2.6.x issue, btw.
