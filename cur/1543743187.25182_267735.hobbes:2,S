In drivers/ethernet and drivers/ide there already are directories for e.g.
arm and ppc so I would like to add cris in the same way. I agree that the
v10 subdirectories are unnecessary, I'll remove them. Under serial and
usb/host there are no such subdirs so I will store the drivers directly
under those dirs.
Expect new patches tomorrow.

Given that you have only a handfull drivers those subdirectories don't
make sense.  Just give the drivers sane names and move them directly
to the appropinquate directories under drivers/
