Well, no sleep developers have SMP or HT machines, AFAICT.
If you back that out... well you are on your own.

As far as I can see, noone is interested in S1. If you want to help
with it... [There's no need to stop tasks/stop devices on non-broken
hardware. Unfortunately there's a lot of broken hw out there, so I'm
not sure we can do it by default.]
