As a thought experiment...
1) top usually averages over 5 seconds
2) 5% of 5 seconds is 0.25 seconds
What I'm getting at is that it is possible that there are cases where we could
be taking significant amounts of time to respond to something, without the
overall average being too high.
If we have even a single 0.1 second delay, that's going to be noticeable to the
user without seriously bumping up system percentages.
