Well, I definitely expected that such would be the case at least
currently.  What I really wanted to know was wether it is
possible to have an encrypted fs, that when a user logs in and
mounts it, if while mounted, root goes: cd path_to_encryptedfs
The data is not readable.  Root may be able to hunt around in
kmem, or whatever, but the likelyhood of it is slim for the idea
that I'm interested in.  100% security isn't necessary, more of a
"obscure" the dumb root user from looking at user's private
files.  Not obscure the smart root user who can read kmem, and
wants to spend the time to do so...  ;o)
