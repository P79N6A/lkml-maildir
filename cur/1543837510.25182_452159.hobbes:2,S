Yes, the 3D stuff is in the Mesa CVS repository, but you'll need the
X.org 2D driver and the DRM kernel bits to use it.

Yes, that's all included at the same price. Mesa includes the pieces to
get to a reasonable IR which can then be converted to the necessary
target-specific instruction set by the driver. Much of the 3D driver for
the 965 actually uses GLSL to execute things previously handled by the
traditional fixed function pipeline.
