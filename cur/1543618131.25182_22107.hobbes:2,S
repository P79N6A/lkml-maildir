Hm, I find it particularly interesting that you seem to classify AOL/Time 
Warner as "bad boys". I can't really agree on this, based on a simple
thought: this deal (if it really happens) is purely strategic from their 
side, they will not earn a single buck with it. Instead chances are high
RH is going to be a high flyer afterwards, we all know where they want to
go tomorrow :-)
I can see big chances arising, why not take them?
Just go ahead, Steve!
(I can say that frankly here, he's not going to read it anyway ;-)
Regards,
Stephan
