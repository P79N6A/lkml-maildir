gee, it seems rather arbitrary.  Perhaps we should have set it to zero on
day one to _force_ distributors to set an appropriate RLIMIT_MEMLOCK in
init.
We can do this of course, but does it actually help anything?  Perhaps it's
actually a bad thing, permitting userspace developers to rely upon kernel
defaults rather than setting things they way they should be set?
