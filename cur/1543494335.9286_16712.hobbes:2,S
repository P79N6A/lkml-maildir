I have iinstalled Red Hat linux 5.2 (kernel 2.0.36) with kde 1.1 final and some
days ago i tried to upgrade the kernel but i failed.
i have the entire kernel (2.2.3) files in rpm format and the old kernel
(2.0.36) is rpm too.
which rpm's file do i have to upgrade (with Glint) or i have to upgrade (or
install) all the files of kernel 2.2.3 ?
how can i make the new boot disk to start linux (from /dev/fd0) ?
