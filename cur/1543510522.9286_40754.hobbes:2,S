Another victim of the stock nfs subsystem.  You need to get the latest
knfsd utilities and kernel patches from hj lu:
ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/knfsd/knfsd-1.5.tar.gz
Apply kernel patches per his documentation, rebuild, reboot and enjoy
reliable NFS fcntl locking.
Your test program runs without incident on 2.2.12 + hjl
