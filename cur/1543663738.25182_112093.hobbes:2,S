people are doing this *for real* -- it really depends on what you define
as compressed.
ARM thumb is definitely a compression function for code.
x86 native instructions are compressed compared to the RISC-like micro-ops
which a processor like athlon, p3, and p4 actually execute.  for similar
operations, an x86 would average probably 1.5 bytes to encode what a
32-bit RISC would need 4 bytes to encode.
