Doug, "without ioctl errors" suggests that there might be *other* errors.  
If so, could you please write to smartmontools-support at lists dot sf dot
net about them?  We've tried hard to make and keep smartmontools both
64-bit and endian-order clean, but without test machines of all flavors we
rely on bug reports to keep us honest.
Cheers,
