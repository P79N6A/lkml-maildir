Why would it be a problem? /proc/mounts shows names in the context of
process reading it. We could filter out stuff that happens to be
outside of visible subtree, but that won't change anything.
Could somebody post the exact way to reproduce the problem? -o remount
scenario is obvious, but that's a case of you get what you ask for.
Anything else?
