	Dear Readers:
I would like to ask that anyone with this setup to please test this out
i think there is a kernel bug (if not Sorry for the email) when i run
glxgears (or any opengl) with my pc it locks hard when direct rendering
is enabled.  I have tried both GATOS drivers (
http://gatos.sf.net
) and
the defualt drivers that come with X both we the same results.  I think
there is a bug within either the Ali driver or the ATI Radeon 7500 drm
module (i have a few people say they have crashes not all the time but
sometimes) (i have tried this with out ali enabled with just agpgart and
it didn't do DRM) my system is an Asus mother board with ali agp and 256
megs of ram running Debian Sid with Xfree86 4.2
	Sincerly,
	Nicholas
