David, 
On a related topic, the 3c575_cb driver on an IBM Thinkpad 765D is getting
tx errors on the 2.2.18 kernel with PCMCIA services 3.1.22.
Card is a 3Com 3CCFE575BT Cyclone Cardbus Adapter.
Error is:
eth0:  transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status e000.
  diagnostics net 0cc2 media a800 dma 000000a0
Windows NT 4 and W2K work flawlessly with the same hardware setup, and have
for about 1 year.
