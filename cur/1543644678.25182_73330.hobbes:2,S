It's needed to deal with exceptions and GC.

But you haven't read the code and the supporting white papers for this
JIT compiler otherwise you wouldn't be whining about this. HotSpot is
no whimp when it comes to these issues. Compilers execute code, code is
stored some where and does memory allocation. Geez.

Then you need to look at the compilation architecture of HotSpot. It's pretty
different than your picture of it and is gross oversimplification. Hell,
I don't know what much of it does since it's so freaking large.

Dude, you have not been reading this thread... Nothing valuable is at syscall
time per thread, those are external symbol calls that contain nothing of value
to the GC. It's allowed to execute at that point so any allocated chunk of memory
is going to be properly shoved some where known to the GC.
The stuff that's of value to maintain the correctness of this is within executing
code blocks in the method dictionary... move the program counter to a specific
place, funny execution stuff that I haven't looked at yet since I was pretty happy
about getting the threading glue to the OS working, etc...

Which HotSpot has...Read the papers... Thread local storage exists.
This isn't a just a GC library isolated from a compiler. This a very sophisticated
compiler with a heavy threading infrastructure and you have to take into account
various kinds of interaction with the GC. It is non-trivial stuff.

It can be if you have to send a single to each thread to get the ucontext.

With a non-PTRACE interface to those ucontexts...
