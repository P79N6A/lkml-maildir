	Hello,
	After downloading latest 2.4.3-ac9 kernel and compiling it I found
that when I insert the i2c-matroxfb module, the modprobe utility
completely monopolize the system during about a minute everything gets
really slow and it seems that it do something on the virtual consoles
during this time, because if I change virtual console my monitor gets out
of sync for an instant, the same that happens when you have the consoles
set to different resolution/refresh rate. Everything gets fixed after it
load. 
	Any clue?
