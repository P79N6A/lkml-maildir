Changing the validate_fields call to use
	if (i_size_read(inode) != va.va_size)
		i_size_write(inode, va.va_size);
should take care of directories, certainly better than the
direct assignment to i_size which is in there now....
This is called from the directory ops which modify the
contents of a directory and should already be under the
i_sem. The vn_revalidate code should use a != test
as well of course...

We worked hard not to hold it, but that i_size_write in
the middle of the async_io code is tough to work around.

But that is called out of an extending setattr or a buffered write which
hold the semaphore. Hmm, actually O_DIRECT write can be in there as
well, but that is the same problem as the generic I/O path call.
