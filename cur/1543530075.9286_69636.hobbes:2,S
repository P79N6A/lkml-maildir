Hi, 
I got some trouble with the 3c589_cs card since kernel 2.3.51 (2.3.49 was
the last successfull kernel).
The symptoms are easy :
1- when I insert the card the light on the adapter goes on (steady light)
2- when I do the ifconfig eth1 up then the light goes blinking (which shows
that the link cannot be negociated)
3- when I do ifconfig down, the light goes off
I am not able to use the card to connect myself with a network.
Have anybody got a hint to what is wrong ?
 BTW, the pcmcia is 1.3.11 - tried 1.3.13 with no more luck.
