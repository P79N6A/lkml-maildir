The USB core already insures that suspend and resume are mutually 
exclusive with bind and unbind, so that part doesn't matter.
Besides, there's a more important reason for not merging the pm and unbind
mutexes: The pm mutex lies in the usb_device structure but the unbind
mutex lies in the private data structure.
It has to be this way.  The pm mutex is used by the USB core, which
doesn't know anything about the private data.  Conversely, the driver has
to acquire the unbind mutex at times when it doesn't know whether or not
it has already been unbound, so that mutex must go in the private data.  
Otherwise the driver might try to acquire the mutex -- thereby touching
the usb_device -- after it was unbound, violating immediate detachment.

I was just using read() as an example.  And it wouldn't block autoresume;
it would _do_ an autoresume, thereby preventing autosuspend.
Another possible arrangement would be to have open() do an autoresume
(preventing autosuspend during the entire time the device file is held
open) and have close() re-enable autosuspend.  But the principle remains
the same.
I don't know, perhaps adding another mutex would work.  I need to think 
about it some more.
There's always the easy solution: Don't do a complete immediate detach.  
The driver could keep a reference to the device structure for an extended
period, provided it always checks private->gone whenever it locks
usbdev->sem.  This would mean that the USB core might not be able to
release usbdev until the lower-level driver was unloaded.  But that's
okay: Since the lower-level driver contains code references to routines in
the USB core, the core would be pinned anyway.
This example does show that implementing immediate detach comes with a
price.  It makes things more complicated than they would be otherwise.
