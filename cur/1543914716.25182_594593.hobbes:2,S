This distributed storage is very much needed; even if it were to act
as a more capable/performant replacement for NBD (or MD+NBD) in the
near term.  Many high availability applications don't _need_ all the
additional complexity of a full distributed filesystem.  So given
that, its discouraging to see you trying to gently push Evgeniy away
from all the promising work he has published.
Evgeniy, please continue your current work.
