Yes, the module issue is completely tangential.  We would like to have 
the ability to load a hypervisor module at run-time, and this may be 
slightly nicer from a GPL point of view, by allowing us to publish a GPL 
module that interfaces to the kernel.  But the Something layer really is 
more like firmware, and merely making a GPL'd module interface to it 
doesn't actually change the underlying legal / technical ramifications 
that Alan pointed out.
