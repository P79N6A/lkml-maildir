Yes it's a known issue that the aoss emulation is not perfect, it's not
a reason to ditch ALSA, it's a reason to fix it.
Please provide a reproducible test case where an app *that we have the
source code for* works with native OSS or the in kernel /dev/dsp OSS
emulation and fails with the aoss/alsa-lib/userspace OSS emulation and
it will be fixed ASAP.
