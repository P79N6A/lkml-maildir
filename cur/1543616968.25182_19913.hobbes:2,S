Subject: [ANNOUNCE] kernelconf-0.1.1 - menu dependencies working

Here goes another release of kernelconf...
Highlights are, expression parsing (almost complate), expression evaluation,
and menu dependencies.  Most work was done on menuconfig.
0.2.0 will contain full support for dependencies, derived values and menu
dependencies. 0.1.1 has most necessary infrastructure to handle expressions,
but I want to go through the code again to make sure that everything is fine,
before trying anything further.  Also, refinements and cleanups are necessary
for some parts of the code.
Notice that I am trying to keep kernelconf interface compatible with CML1 at
the initial stages.
