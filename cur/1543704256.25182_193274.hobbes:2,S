Hi Andrew,
With the latest pmtmr fixes, synaptics mouse driver is in sync again and
my bogomips are correct too. (synaptics had been loosing packages in -mm
releases the last weeks)
Only the radeon dri driver cannot be inserted because of an missing
symbol: 
radeon: Unknown symbol cmpxchg
Thx for the frequent releases,
Jan
