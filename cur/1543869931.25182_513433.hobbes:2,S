No, kevent_dequeue_ready() copies data to userspace, that is it.
So it looks roughly following:
storage is ready: -> kevent_requee() - ends up in ading event to the end
of the queue (list add under spinlock)
kevent_wait() -> copy first, second, ...
Kevent poll (as long as epoll) model requires _additional_ check in 
userspace context before it is copied, so we endup with checking the 
full ready queue again - that what I pointed as O(ready_num), O() implies 
price for copying to userspace, list_add and so on.
