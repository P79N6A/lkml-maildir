I wanted to try to treat nonreclaimable pages, whatever the reason,
uniformly.  Lumpy reclaim wasn't there when I started on this, but we've
been able to handle them.  I was more interested in page migration.  The
act of isolating the page from the LRU [under zone lru_lock] arbitrates
between racing tasks attempting to migrate the same page.  That and we
keep the isolated pages on a list using the LRU links.  We can't migrate
pages that we can't successfully isolate from the LRU list.  Nick had
addressed this by putting mlocked pages back on the lru for migration.
Seemed like unnecessary work to me.  And, as I recall, this lost the
mlock count and it had to be reestablished over time.

I also agree they don't need to be scanned.  And, altho' having them on
an LRU list has other uses, I suppose that having mlocked pages on the
noreclaim list could be considered "clutter" if we did want to scan the
noreclaim list for other types of non-reclaimable pages that might have
become reclaimable.
