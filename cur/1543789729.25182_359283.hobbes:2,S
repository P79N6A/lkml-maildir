Yes I know, but the amount of pagecache which is RESIDENT for a process
is not that seperate from RSS, I think. 
I always thought RSS is the amount of mapped and anonymous 
pages of a process, which are in physical memory (aka resident). 
So I consider the amount of mapped pagecache pages of 
a process which are in physical memory (aka resident) a subset.
Or do you care about page cache pages not mapped into the process?
Is this the point I miss?
Please enlighten me :-)
