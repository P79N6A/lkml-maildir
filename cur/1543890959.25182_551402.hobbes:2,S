When this line is missed and CONFIG_RSS_COUNTER is n the following
warnings are produced:
  CC      mm/memory.o

Yes. As far as I see from Paul's code when one of the files is failed to
be created the whole container is cleaned up.

Yes. In include/linux/countainer_subsys.h we declared the SUBSYS(rss) 
that is expanded into "extern struct container_subsys rss_subsys;" in the
kernel/container.c file. Further the pointer to it is injected into the array
of subsystems (static struct container_subsys *subsys[]; at the top of the file).
