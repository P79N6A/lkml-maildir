We seem to be lagging behind "the industry" in some areas - handling large
devices, high bandwidth IO, sophisticated on-disk data structures, advanced
manageability, etc.
I mean, although ZFS is a rampant layering violation and we can do a lot of
the things in there (without doing it all in the fs!) I don't think we can
do all of it.
We're continuing to nurse along a few basically-15-year-old filesystems
while we do have the brains, manpower and processes to implement a new,
really great one.
It's just this feeling I have ;)
