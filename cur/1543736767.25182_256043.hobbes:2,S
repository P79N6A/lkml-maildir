I don't either!  This doesn't look right to me at all.  
These enable_irq/disable_irq calls got added recently to -mm, probably
in the fix-for-spurious-interrupts-on-e100-resume-2.patch.  Maybe just
the disable_irq call is all that is needed to solve the spurious
interrupt case?
Ganesh, can we back out patch out of -mm and go back to the drawing
board on the original problem?  This patch will cause problems.
