I think many people on this list will be delighted to read this. I'm 
looking for the 22-pre to help testing them (UP)... As alan said, 
increasing the user test base may cause to find some remaining bugs but 
as many people are already forced to patch their 2.4 kernel with aic7xxx 
and ACPI just to make it useable most severe/obvious bugs have probably 
already been found...
I think SMP server users will also be happy with the rest of proposed fixes.
Side comments just to try to make 2.4 even better : I think polling the 
list to see the most annoying problems or most requested feature people 
have/want is sometime a good idea. Of course you will always get mail 
from people that what a patch to have support for their baroque hardware 
but I think you may reach a consensus rapidly as in the previous (rude) 
mail exchanges.
Hope you will manage to spend the needed time to make this in a timely 
fashion.
