Hello,
sorry, if this is a little bit off-topic but I don't known where else to 
ask for!
The following situation is given:
An executable uses a small :-) number of (POSIX-)threads. One of them is 
the "input-thread" that blocks on select and delivers incoming data to a 
reentrant queue. I need this thread to avoid a too high dropping rate for 
udp data! A "processing-thread" reads the items from the queue and does 
the "real" processing. I detected that the "input-thread" seems to be 
potentially much faster than the "processing-thread" but under normal 
load, I thought, this effect is regulated by the scheduler since busy 
processes with SCHED_OTHER should have a higher priority than the 
idle-process :-). 
Unfortunately even under such conditions the number of items in the 
internal queue between the "input-thread" and the "processing-thread" 
increases continuously. Strange is, that the evaluation of /proc/stat and 
/proc/loadavg showed idle schedules between 70 and 90 percent.
How is this possible?
The only thing I could imagine is that the "processing-thread" is not 
really busy but waits for the completion of some slow input/output 
operations. Anyway - in this case it would be important to me to identify 
this slow input/output operations.
Does the kernel provide any logging facilities related to this 
identification?
Or does anbody know a solution for the original problem?
I use the following environment:
Red Hat Linux 8.0 3.2-7 with Linux version 2.4.18-14
Much thanks
Andreas
