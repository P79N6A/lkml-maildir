Yes. So can a bug in an LSM or in new rlimits code.
But bugs can be fixed. Poorly designed APIs cannot. That's why the
best API from the kernel perspective is no API: do it in userspace
wherever possible. Bring the kernel in only when the kernel can do it
better, more cleanly, and more generally. The rlimits-on-priorities
approach may qualify in that it might solve problems for other folks
(games on the desktop, CD burning, and the like) and isn't a bad fit
into the rest of the standard security model, but it's still got a
wart or two.
I suppose I ought to spell out my personal LSM bias while I'm at it:
- it invites ad-hoc extensions like this
- we have enough security issues without supporting a proliferation of
  incompatible security models
So while I think it's perfectly fine for people to kludge up things
like this, I don't think they belong in the tree unless they're _very_
generally applicable and _very_ well thought out. LSMs should not be
treated like drivers.
