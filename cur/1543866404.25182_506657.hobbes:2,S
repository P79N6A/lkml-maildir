Subject: [PATCH 0/2 REVIEW] Multiple transmit/receive queue kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
The following two patches are submitted for review. Please provide feedback
and comments as usual.
This set of patches implements a generic API for multiqueue-capable
devices to have network stack support to assign multiple flows into each
queue on the NIC.  It provides an interface for non-multiqueue devices
to coexist in a machine running with both types of devices, as well as
providing a modified queuing discipline to assign multiple flows in the
stack to individual queues on the NIC.  This is necessary to alleviate
more head-of-line-blocking issues with different priority flows, where
today QoS only prevents HOLB within the stack, but not in the device.
Some Intel PRO/1000 adapters support this hardware feature, so this
series includes a patch to the e1000 driver to enable this hardware
feature for those devices. You will need to setup the queue's using tc.
Limited queue statistics are available through ethtool for devices that
support multiple queues.
Regards,
Auke Kok
Peter Waskiewicz Jr.
