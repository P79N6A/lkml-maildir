Here are some numbers on a 4way x86 - PIII 700Mhz with 1G memory (hmm,
highmem not enabled).  I should hopefully have a 2way ppc available
later today for a pair of runs.
dbench and tbench were run 50 times each, kernbench and reaim 10 times
each.  Results are mean +/- 95% confidence half-interval.  Kernel had
selinux and capabilities compiled in.
A little surprising: kernbench is improved, but dbench and tbench
are worse - though within the 95% CI.
dbench (throughput, larger is better):
original: 357.957780 +/- 3.509188
patched:  351.266820 +/- 4.736168
tbench (throughput, larger is better):
original: 38.710270 +/- 0.028970
patched:  38.210506 +/- 0.032954
kernbench (time, smaller is better):
original: 91.837000 +/- 0.324471
patched:  91.466000 +/- 0.308797
reaim (#children vs throughput, larger is better):
