To be precise, I was thinking about something like this (in pseudo-code):
	kthread_stop_info.k = k;
	save_freezable_status(current);
	set_always_freezable(current);
	/* Now, we know that the freezer will wait for us, although we're not
	 * really going to freeze
	 */
	task_lock(k);
	k->flags |= PF_NOFREEZE;
	if (frozen(k))
		k->flags &= ~PF_FROZEN;
	task_unlock(k);
	wake_up_process(k);
	put_task_struct(k);
	/* Once it dies, reset stop ptr, gather result and we're done. */
	wait_for_completion(&kthread_stop_info.done);
	restore_freezable_status(current);

Well, I'm not sure either, but I guess the most practical way to learn it is to
send a patch. ;-)
