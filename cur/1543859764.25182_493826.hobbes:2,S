Without proof^H^H^H^H^Hpasting my dmesg and the "diff", I already
concluded that ide_setup was the culprit. (I've debuged
parse_one, and it barfed around the 3rd parameter which is
hdb=noprobe).
Anyway, a bad night of sleep reminds me that our EM64T boxes also
have this line (which actually is a remainder of our VA1220 boxes
;-) ), and they don't barf, so it must be either the combination
of the sata_nv together with the pata driver part, *or* just the
pata driver part. (Our opteron != nforce chipsets also works).
I will trace down the ide_setup today. First loads of coffee.
