    PS. Whot does this have in common with the inner workings of the
    Linux kernel?
All the detailed questions about the inner workings of Linux would be
of no importance to anyone, if we did not have an operating system to
use it in.  And that operating system was developed for idealistic
reasons.
Freedom includes the right to sneer at freedom; no one can force you
to care about anything.  But that won't change the fact that the
idealism you despise is the reason why your operating system exists,
and the reason why it is free software.  And the system is likely to
remain free, only as long as people who care about their freedom make
the effort to keep it free.
