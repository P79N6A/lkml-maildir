Yeah, it's strange.  Even /proc/iomem from a working boot looks ok:
d0700000-d07fffff : PCI Bus #04
d0800000-d08fffff : PCI Bus #05
f0000000-f7ffffff : pnp 00:01
fec00000-fec00fff : IOAPIC 0
fed00000-fed003ff : HPET 0

Yeah, I'll look a little more closely.  It could also be that another 
register needs tweaking somewhere to actually get the bridge to decode 
the space.

I'm talking with them now, hopefully they'll shed some light on it.
Thanks,
