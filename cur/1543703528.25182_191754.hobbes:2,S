Apparently, the PM timer now works as of 2.6.1-mm4:
#v+
Detected 1700.569 MHz processor.
Using pmtmr for high-res timesource
#v-
But the BogoMIPS loop is still wrong:
#v+
Calibrating delay loop... 1683.45 BogoMIPS
#v-
It looks as if it needed to be multiplied by two, right?
Additionally, the /proc/cpuinfo is not updated on governor change (I'm
using the speedstep-ich driver which otherwise works fine), although the
real CPU frequency certainly is. I'm not sure if this is in any way 
related though.
