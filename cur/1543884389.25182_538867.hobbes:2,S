IMO you are both right and wrong in your own ways.
I agree with Neil that you* have to go to the people who are concerned.
I agree with you that LKML will often not be the place where you* find
them.  (Still, you* have to find them; it's not that they have to find
your wiki discussion.)

enough with the communities to help in feature removal processes
