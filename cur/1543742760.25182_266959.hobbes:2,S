Well, an arbitrary web page need not be sufficient.  Apparently, the web page 
needs to contain JavaScript to make konqueror crash.  Also, when JavaScript 
is disabled in konqueror, it works normally, so I assume that it crashes on 
an attempt to execute JavaScript.

Done.  Evidently, if the cputime patches:
cputime-introduce-cputime-fix.patch
cputime-introduce-cputime.patch
cputime-missing-pieces.patch
are reversed, konqueror works fine again on 2.6.10-rc1-mm2 (verified on two 
different systems).
I have created a bugzilla entry for it at:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3675
If you need any more information, please let me know and I'll post it there.
Greets,
