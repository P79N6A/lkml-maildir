Is it possible that the inter-cpu balancing is broken in 2.5.2-pre11?
eatcpu is a simple cpu hog ("for(;;);"). Dual CPU i386.
$nice -19 ./eatcpu&;
 <wait>
$nice -19 ./eatcpu&;
 <wait>
$./eatcpu&.
IMHO it should be
* both niced process run on one cpu.
* the non-niced process runs with a 100% timeslice.
But it's the other way around:
One niced process runs with 100%. The non-niced process with 50%, and
the second niced process with 50%.
