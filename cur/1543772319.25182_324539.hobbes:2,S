I've become more confused, if that's possible.  I was just editing some
test script in emacs.  As part of the script creation process I used the
M-! command to pipe the output of 'ls /test/a' into a buffer.  It
snapped back almost instantly.
So this seems to have something to do w/ bash, not filesystems.  I
think.  So seems OT for this list, but I still don't understand where
the sluggishness comes from.
BTW, I just did the same test w/ XFS and the results were almost
identical.
Best.
