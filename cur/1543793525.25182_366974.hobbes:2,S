Yes invariably the GPU has crashed and isn't responding to anything.
unfortuantely radeons have a lot of reasons for crashing most of them very
unrelated to anything like reality...  we normally try and approach them
on a case by case basis as some can be solved easily some not so...
Also what X was doing etc at the time is invalulable info..
Dave.
