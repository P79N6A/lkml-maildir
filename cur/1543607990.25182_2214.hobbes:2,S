... and that protection is worth nothing, since we copy data to/from
userland.  Forget about BKL - it doesn't prevent races.
There is a shitload of rmmod (and plain "we remove the object" - it doesn't
have to be a module) races in that area.  Composite trees _suck_.  sysctls,
devfs, ddfs - whatever.  If tree is served by several drivers - it's broken.
In case of sysctls I have an old patch that could be turned into something
working, but that will take a lot of changes in code that exports sysctls,
so that may be very painful.
