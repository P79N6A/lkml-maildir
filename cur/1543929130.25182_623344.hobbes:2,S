Yes, indeed. The other name of "fixed phys" are "platform phys"
or "platform MDIO bus" on which virtual PHYs are placed.
That is, these phys supposed to be created by the platform setup
code (arch/). The rationale here is: we do hardware emulation, thus
to make drivers actually see that "hardware", we have to create it
early.

^^ the correct solution is to implement arch_initcall function
which will create fixed PHYs, and then leave only
snprintf(fpi->bus_id, 16, PHY_ID_FMT, 0, *data); part in the
fs_enet's find_phy().
Try add something like this to the fsl_soc.c (compile untested):
- - - -
static int __init of_add_fixed_phys(void)
{
	struct device_node *np;
	const u32 *prop;
	struct fixed_phy_status status = {};
	while ((np = of_find_node_by_name(NULL, "ethernet"))) {
		data  = of_get_property(np, "fixed-link", NULL);
		if (!data)
			continue;
		status.link = 1;
		status.duplex = data[1];
		status.speed  = data[2];
		ret = fixed_phy_add(PHY_POLL, data[0], &status);
		if (ret)
			return ret;
	}
	return 0;
}
arch_initcall(of_add_fixed_phys);
- - - -
And remove fixed_phy_add() from the fs_enet. This should work
nicely and also should be ideologically correct. ;-)

We should mark fixed.c as bool. Fake/virtual/fixed/platform PHYs
creation is architecture code anyway, can't be =m.
