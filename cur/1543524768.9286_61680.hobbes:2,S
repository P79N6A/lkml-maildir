I found ISA PnP may cause trouble to my ISA modem.
Previously I reported that 2.3.39 produces LSR check to the ISA PnP
modems, but 2.3.16 has no problem.

I modified inb/outb and make it display the params with printk() if
the port is regarding to the modem. This experiment shows that only
functions in "serial.c" touche it.
Then, I doubted ISA PnP, because it is the only feature which noticed
the existence of the modem.  And actually, disabling ISA PnP resolves
the problem.
I know nothing about the ISA PnP mechanism, some thing may have be
changed between 2.3.16 and 2.3.39.
PnP function is not mandatory for me, disabling it makes me happy.
Thank you.
