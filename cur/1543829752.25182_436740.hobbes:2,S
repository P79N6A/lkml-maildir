No, with IO-APIC enabled, it's using the local APIC timer, thus
using_apic_timer is 1 and the path right after unlocking in
timer_interrupt() is taken towards update_process_times().

Guess I found one, not sure if it works correctly though ;)
Using 4K stacks, we have one stack for hard irqs and one for soft irqs,
both having their own threadinfo and thus preemptcount. Thus the call to
softirq_count() in account_system_time() will always return 0 when
called in hard irq context. Additionally preemptcount is always set to
HARDIRQ_OFFSET in hard irq context, so
hardirq_count() - hardirq_offset is 0 all the time as well.
But that doesn't fit the fact that I at least get hard irq accounting
when booting with noapic. And it also doesn't explain why your fix
works, fixing both, soft and hard irq accounting. Am I missing some
code path that calls smp_local_timer_interrupt? There's
smp_apic_timer_interrupt(), but that seems to be unused on i386.
