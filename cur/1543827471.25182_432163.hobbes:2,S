Even for normal mutices pthread_mutex_unlock and
pthread_cond_{signal,broadcast} is supposed to honor the RT priority and
scheduling policy when waking up:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_mutex_trylock.html
"If there are threads blocked on the mutex object referenced by mutex when
pthread_mutex_unlock() is called, resulting in the mutex becoming available,
the scheduling policy shall determine which thread shall acquire the mutex."
and similarly for condvars.
"Use PI" is not a valid answer for this.
Really FUTEX_WAKE/FUTEX_REQUEUE can't use a FIFO.  I think there was a patch
floating around to use a plist there instead, which is one possibility,
another one is to keep the queue sorted by priority (and adjust whenever
priority changes - one thread can be waiting on at most one futex at a
time).
