Thing is, ntfs_inode.name[] is an array of le16's.  But local variable `i'
in there is a byte index, not an le16 index.  We end up writing that 0x0000
at twice the intended offset.
So I think this was meant:
--- a/fs/ntfs/inode.c~a
+++ a/fs/ntfs/inode.c
@@ -140,7 +140,7 @@ static int ntfs_init_locked_inode(struct
 		if (!ni->name)
 			return -ENOMEM;
 		memcpy(ni->name, na->name, i);
-		ni->name[i] = 0;
+		ni->name[na->name_len] = 0;
 	}
 	return 0;
 }
