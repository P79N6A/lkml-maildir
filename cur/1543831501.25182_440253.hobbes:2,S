Much better done in userspace - the kernel can't get this right without
some user hinting.  For starters, it creates a big security hole in all
the code that does an open()/unlink().
Also, how do you handle the corner cases?  The fact you're adding to the
pathname of the file means you might push some long names over the MAXPATHLEN
value, and you have to worry about name collisions in the directory, and
so on.  There's also more subtle leakage issues, such as properly handling
the permissions on the files on a multi-user system so users can't rummage
each other's trash....
