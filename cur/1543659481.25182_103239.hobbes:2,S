   ChangeSet 1.930.8.1, 2003/01/13 10:26:50-06:00, jejb@raven.il.steeleye.com
   
   	Update the generic DMA API to take GFP_ flags on allocation
   	
   	dma_alloc_[non]coherent now takes the GFP_ flags as the last argument.
   	The flags passed in may not interfere with the memory zone.
   
   
What about platforms that can only use GFP_ATOMIC due to
implementation side issues?  Is that "OK"?
