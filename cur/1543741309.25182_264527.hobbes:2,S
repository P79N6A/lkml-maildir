OK. Am now trying with -V0.2, it works better but locks up in more
mysterious ways.... The modprobe messages are gone - thanks.
Was able (once) to get the X server up and started some of my tests
but the machine locked up (no mouse movement, no response to keyboard)
and had to use the hardware reset to recover. Only significant message
in the system log was
BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context hdparm(3606) at
kernel/mutex.c
in_atomic():0 [00000000], irqs_disabled():1
... will send stack traceback separately ...
when setting udma2 mode in hdparm.
Also noticed a "14 minute gap" in the log file, presumably when I was
running my real time test. I could not get control back until the first
test had run to completion (but heard the audio - so the machine was
working...). Machine locked up within the next 4 minutes.
The second try, the X server came up but the system froze when I tried
to login (according to the splash screen, was reloading my environment).
Messages in the log file were normal until the failure.
Third try, booting with selinux=0. Froze up again, this time the X
server did not make it all the way up. Last image is the blue background
with the hourglass cursor (frozen in center).
I will send what I can, please advise any further tests or data you
need for analysis.
