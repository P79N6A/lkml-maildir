There is, yes. I'll be sure to seperate it.

OK.

I don't think so, because you also have the success case, which is
!balanced && !failed.

ttwu_cnt in the rq stats, and ttwu_wake_affine / ttwu_wake_balance
in the domain stats.

ttwu_remote/ttwu_wake_remote are the number of times a runqueue has
woken a remote task / a remote task within that domain, respectively.
Regardless of whether or not it gets pulled onto the local CPU.

sbe_pushed should basically be the same as smt_cnt, barring rare
races with the cpus_allowed mask. I guess sbe_cnt doesn't have to
go.

Yeah removing the runqueue counters for these would be good.

Whatever domain that the pulling CPU was in, is also a fair candidate
for pt_lost. Remember, all the domains are per-CPU so any information
you can get from a per-runqueue counter you can also get from a domain
counter.
I'll make a few changes and give you another look. Thanks for the comments.
