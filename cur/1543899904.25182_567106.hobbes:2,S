Is the unlikely a good idea here? Not having any targets may be
unusual but it isn't ridiculous. It might even be a sensible default
for distros. My (very limited) understanding of unlikely is that it
could impose a very large penalty in that case and would make a very
marginal difference at best in the common case.
Cheers,
Duane.
