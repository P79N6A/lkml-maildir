Right. But that's fine, we can deal with that, if the error is
posted.
Problem is no error is posted when we sendmsg[1], yet the socket
thereafter stays write-blocked, with (sane) way for us to recover.  
(until presumably link comes back, for what ever reason,
unfortunately the OSPF RFCs do not mandate for hosts to have robots
attached to do media maintenance :) ).
In short, for raw sockets at least, the kernel needs to either:
- post an error for writes to raw sockets if they will block
or 
- if the network driver concerned is not ready to take the packet,
drop the packet right there. (upper layers (ie userspace, eg ospfd)  
will follow their own procedures for dealing with packet loss/down
interfaces.)

1. Least, Hasso has not reported the relevant error message occuring.
