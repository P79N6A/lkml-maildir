Hmm. mss routing table attribute is only used by local TCP connections.
With a tunnel the TCP connections are not local, they originate from some
other host (which has no idea about ipsec). How would this other host know
about the MSS you set in the routing table ? 
(with shifting state I meant it would need to move to all the tunnel
using hosts, which is of course impossible. It has to be done dynamically.)
