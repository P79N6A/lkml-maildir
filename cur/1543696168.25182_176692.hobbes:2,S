No, I told you to use _my_ 2.6 tree which contains a new radeonfb
that have not yet been merged upstream.
bk://ppc.bkbits.net/linuxppc-2.5-benh or rsync from
source.mvista.com::linuxppc-2.5-benh

Ugh ?
Yaboot normally loads a plain vmlinux, though if you are using tftp, you
need to modify yaboot to be able to d/l more than 4Mb (edit fs_of.c and
change the allocated size). The ELF image should work, at least the
one produced by my tree does, it's possible that there's a similar size
problem with the one in Linus tree, a few of those recent changes haven't
yet made it to Linus.
Ben.
