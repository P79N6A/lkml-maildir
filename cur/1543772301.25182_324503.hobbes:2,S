These tend to run together so just try adding my four patches together. In 
retrospect I guess they're likely candidates because they also change the 
_ratio_ of balance which they should not so they are buggy as a group 
currently. Easy enough to fix but it will make it easy to pinpoint the 
problem if they're responsible.
sched-implement-nice-support-across-physical-cpus-on-smp.patch
sched-change_prio_bias_only_if_queued.patch
sched-account_rt_tasks_in_prio_bias.patch
sched-smp-nice-bias-busy-queues-on-idle-rebalance.patch
