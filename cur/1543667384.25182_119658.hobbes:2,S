Your dd is benchmarking the lock operations in the C library I suspect.
The kernel will happily use both processors and a given syscall can
evne start on one cpu and complete on another, or have the IRQ tasks
executed on its behalf on another CPU.
There are *good* reasons btw for avoiding splitting stuff too far, the
cost of copying data between processor caches is very high.
