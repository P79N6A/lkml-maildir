I'm aware of patchutils.  (Check the 0.2.22 Changelog ;) )  However, 
splitdiff doesn't do what I'm after, from my initial look.  Though now 
that I think about it, it suggests an alternative solution.  A 
'shatterdiff' that created one diff file per hunk in a patch would give 
me basically what I want.  I could then use directories and 'mv' to sort 
out the parts.  Repetative calls to 'combinediff' would suffice for 
cleaning up the ensuing mess, I think.  Hmm...  That would get me to the 
hunk level, but not the sub-hunk, though editdiff/rediff might help there.
Thanks,
Eli
