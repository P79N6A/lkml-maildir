bk send -wgzip_uu -r<rev> - > foo-<rev>.bk
This will dump a gzipped-uuencoded changset to the file.  The receiver
just do "| bk receive [repository] -avv" to import it on the other end.
My preferred format for sending BK CSETs is below.  The gzip_uu CSET
data only adds maybe 10% for large patches, and about doubles the size
of very small patches.  I also created a bz64 (bzip2 + base64) wrapper
which makes the CSET data smaller, but that is only useful if other BK
developers have this wrapper also.
Cheers, Andreas
