The try_to_freeze() is needed so that the process doesn't block the freezing
of tasks (it is supposed to call refrigerator() as soon as reasonably possible
when freezing(current) is true).
Alternatively, we might return 0 from do_sys_poll() if do_poll() has
returned 0 and both signal_pending(current) and freezing(current) are
true.  Below is a patch that implements that.  Could you please try it?
Greetings,
Rafael
