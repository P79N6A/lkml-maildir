Striking. How can this even happen? A callsite which calls
	dev_alloc_skb(n)
is just equivalent to
	__dev_alloc_skb(n, GFP_ATOMIC);
which means there's like 4 (or 8 if it's long) bytes more on the
stack. For a worst case, count in another 8 bytes for push and pop or mov on
the stack. But that still does not add up to 23 kb.
