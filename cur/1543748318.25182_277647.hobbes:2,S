The rdtsc instruction returns the CPU clocks that have occurred
since the time the machine was started. If you assemble the
provided code as:
as -o tim.o tim.S
... then link this with your code, it will return the CPU clocks
that have occurred between two successive calls..
extern long long tim(void);
code()
{
     long long total;
     (void)tim();         // Initialize
     do_something();      // Some code to measure
     total = tim();       // Get measurement
    printf("Total CPU clocks are %lld\n", total);
}
