    SuSE Linux 7.0, Kernel 2.4.0
    Adaptec 3950U2
    Adaptec 2940
    Although the kernel is complaining about the following things:
    kernel: scsi0: PCI error Interrupt at seqaddr= 0x4e
    kernel: scsi0: Data Parity Error Detected during address or write
    data phase
    ...
    This is compared to the original drivers already a incredible
    change: Those freezed my system after some time (something that did
    not happen before I upgraded from a K6-2 to a K6-2+: Apparently the
    old driver is working with loops or something)
    Continue like this!
