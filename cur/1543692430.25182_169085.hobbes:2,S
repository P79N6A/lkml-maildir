Nope.  It is absolute certainty they know about it.  I had my
lawyer contact them months ago, and the cisco Legal department
was made aware of this and other problems, and responded that
    "the Linksys technical folks are digging into your questions -
    all the the software in question is from Linksys' suppliers
    (Linksys doesn't have the source code to this software), so we
    have to work with these suppliers to address any concerns."
but that was July 15 and I have heard nothing substantive from
them since that time.

How much niceness do they need?  I had my lawyer send the first
of several letters (nice and polite) on 8 May...  After several
additional letters (increasingly less polite) my lawyer and I
were finally contacted by Cisco on June 20.  They stated at that
time "We are in the process of determining what code is subject
to the distribution obligation; once we have done so, all such
code will be made available under the terms of the GPL."
On July 10 they informed us they were setting up their GPL Code
Center.  We informed them on that data that (at least) the
WRT55AG, and WAP54G products also contain Linux and need to have
the GPL'd sources published.  We also informed the Cisco legal
dept on July 10 that they have have not provided source code for
'libnetconf' (which staticly includes iptables/netfilter code),
and since they have shippied zillions of these things, they are
obligated to release source not just libnetconf, but also all
applications linked with libnetconf.
They have not yet addressed that issue despite 2.5 months passing
since their legal department was informed.  When combined with
the issue of the broken kernel they distribute, it is hard to
argue they have acted in good faith at complying.

Yes I know.  My dad (a lawyer) tries to help me with handling
these.  But it takes time and effort, and GPL violating products
are being released faster than I can mail letters....

Regarding Linksys, Bradley Kuhn of the FSF has worked with a
number of the Linksys violatees, starting in the middle of June.
We had a few conference calls and whatnot.  But I've not heard
from them since early July -- I expect other more pressing
concerns have taken precedence.
