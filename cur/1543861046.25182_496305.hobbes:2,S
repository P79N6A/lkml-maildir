Can the XOR engines on the card access host memory or do they only
operate on the card's local memory?  And are there DMA (copy) engines?

[ brainstorming ]
For the RAID5 case: With the hardware acceleration patches the part of
MD that actually operates on the stripe cache is factored out of
handle_stripe5.  So MD can be used to handle all of the cache state
information and then use a SX4 specific operations routine to handle
the data transfers.  However this assumes that all the members of the
array are behind the SX4 (which is the same assumption the vendor
driver makes so maybe its not so bad).
The part I am lost at it is how do you tell libata and the lldd that
data for a transaction is coming from or headed to device local memory
and not host memory?  It seems there would need to be changes to the
dma api to handle this distinction?
