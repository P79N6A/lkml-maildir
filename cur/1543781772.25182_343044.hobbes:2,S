OK that was a poorly contrived example.  Anyway the specific numbers
don't matter as much; it's actually quite a common scenario to run out
of FDs before you can fill the pipe.  It happens to me about once a
week.
Modern P2P protocols all seem to use some type of "swarming".  IIRC the
inspiration was the DDOS attacks of the late 90s - thousands of hosts on
slow connections can fill even the fattest pipe.
