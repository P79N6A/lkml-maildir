As I understand it, the point of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is not so much the 
technical restriction (as you say, the module can lie or the user can 
patch the kernel) but to indicate that the kernel developers consider 
such interfaces to be internal to the kernel such that anything using it 
would be highly likely to be a "derived work" of the kernel.
It's a hint to other developers rather than a prevention measure.
