It's not changing the contexts where smp_processor_id() is called,
just pushing it down one level from a bunch of interrupt handlers
to the 2 oprofile sampling functions they call.  If it was busted
before it's no more nor less busted now.
I presume the perceived problem is that with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y the
thread can be pre-empted onto another CPU?  If it makes everyone
happier I can sprinkle a few preempt_disable()s around, but I'd
prefer to do it in a subsequent patch rather than respin this.
Greg.
