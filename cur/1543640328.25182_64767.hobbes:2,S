So what?
If you make /dev/random useless ("but you can use /dev/urandom instead") 
then we should not have it.

Be realistic. This is what I ask of you. We want _real_world_ security, 
not a completely made-up-example-for-the-NSA-that-is-useless-to-anybody-

All your arguments seem to boil down to "people shouldn't use /dev/random 
at all, they should use /dev/urandom".
Which is just ridiculous.
