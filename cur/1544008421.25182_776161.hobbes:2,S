Well,  no, there are more problems than open file descriptors; and the
worst is much worse than reading or writing another user's file. 
Suppose you're changing the ids of the Perl, Python or PHP interpreter:
the first user could install a SIGCLD handler and fork and exec sleep. 
When sleep dies, the handler gets executed as another user - hopefully a
user with access to credit card details, or other financially valuable
information.
