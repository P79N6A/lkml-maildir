Sigh... What has that got to do with anything?
Read the RFCs: NFS *was* entirely stateless until v4 was drafted.
Locking was never part of the NFS protocol, but was an external addition
that was documented by the Open Group. So, yes, there is a history and a
reason behind all the talk of statelessness.
As for the current thread about remembering device numbers: as far as
NFS is concerned, that is entirely an implementation issue. There is no
need for any extra NFS protocol support for this sort of crap.

It could be done (and probably entirely in userspace). I assume you are
volunteering to do the work?

Sun was doing Kerberos for NFS years before the Samba project was
started.
Security has bugger all to do with kernel or userland and everything to
do with the short-sighted "munitions" policies of certain governments at
the time around when the Sun RPC protocol was being drafted. The same
policies were still around to dictate our implementation much later when
we were doing RPC for Linux. Now the laws have changed, and so we've
finally been able to add strong authentication in 2.6.x.
