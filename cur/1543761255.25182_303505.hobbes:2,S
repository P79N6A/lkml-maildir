The problem is currently CONFIG_ATM_LANE due to the #ifdef's in 
net/atm/common.c .
Letting CONFIG_BRIDGE depend on CONFIG_ATM doesn't sound like a good 
idea, since I doubt all people using the Bridge code require ATM 
support.
Moving the hooks to the bridge code will give you exactly the same 
problems the other way round.
