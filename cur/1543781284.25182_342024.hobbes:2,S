Note that Ingo will not get replies from me anymore - Ingo is doing
sender callback checks on the From:/Sender: headers.  Since my joejob
protection ensures that I never receive bounces to those addresses,
such callbacks fail.  Hence his server rejects my messages.
I am not changing my policy on this - I get hammered with a tremendous
amount of such crap which tools like SA seem completely incapable of
dealing with, sorry.
(Note: this means that other folk, eg dwmw2, are in a similar position.)
