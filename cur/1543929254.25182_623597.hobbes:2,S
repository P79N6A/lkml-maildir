Indexing services would probably benefit much more from a
recursive-aware inotify, though that has its own sort of problems to
solve first.

What am I preparing?
I am actually on a freeze, because I really do not know what to make
of the situation with the static LSM interface.
There is a grave problem with chaining, because you cannot specify
the activation order of one or more LSMs with compiled-in code!
Some kernel Makefiles even contain hints "this depends on link order"
(e.g. net/ipv6/netfilter/Makefile) - and I bet for sure that this
will also be the case for LSM. No thanks.
While we are at it, consider the hypothethical case of a production
server, and the boss tells you to switch to $ThatLSM, with no downtime.
After all, it worked when $Company switched to $ThisLSM with Linux
2.6.x &forall; x<24.
