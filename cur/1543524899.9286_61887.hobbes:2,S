Sorry but thats *BAD* performance by the SK card. I do around 2.5K
ints/sec with the Alteon when doing 65MB/sec traffic in one direction
with regular sized frames. The load is maybe not a problem for the
APIC, but 80k/sec truly sucks for the CPUs considering the number of
context saves/restores they have to do.

It's the switch vendors who are causing the problems.
