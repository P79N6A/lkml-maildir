In the academic realtime literature, for what it is worth, 
priority inversion describes any situation in which a task is delayed by a lower priority task.
priority inheritance is one of several realted algorithms for boosting the priorities of 
         tasks holding exclusive use shared resources so that they can, it is hoped, release
         the resource quickly.
