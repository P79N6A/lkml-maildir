These are harmless debugging messages. Looking at the values it means that
your out of order queue was full. Your rcvbuf was 65535 and the minumum
good_rcvbuf was 11772 so your configuration was perfect.
So you can edit /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c and at line 1496 you
can change the #if 1 to #if 0 and you'll be OK until I'll shutdown the
message in my tree too ;)).
Thanks for the report.

PS. I did some interesting change to the VM in 2.2.3_arca10.gz so probably
    you may want to try it 8)).
