That's the goal.  I'm hacking on it it currently, we have some issues with
how it works today, I'll try and get a bk-3.0.1 release out the door which
fixes them.  
The current format is may be seen with a 
	bk changes -k -r<rev>
where <rev> is the changeset revision you want.  You'll get something like
this:
	torvalds@home.transmeta.com|ChangeSet|20021115061315|00914
That's sort of big and ugly, and it currently doesn't work as a name
in BK/Web.  I'm debugging an implementation of md5 sums of the above
to see if we can use that instead.  I'll let you know as soon as I
have something which works.  
Assuming that we get some format like dSD4okOiGmLGDcqOTpQPFQ== then 
you'll be able to view the cset with the following URL
	
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@dSD4okOiGmLGDcqOTpQPFQ==
and that will always work and never get you different data.
