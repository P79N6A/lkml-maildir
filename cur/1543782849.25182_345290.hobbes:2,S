Hi,
If there are no known issues it would be nice to push this for inclusion in 
2.6.14. The relevant patches from -mm are named 
ppp_mppe-add-ppp-mppe-encryption-module.patch and 
ppp_mppe-add-ppp-mppe-encryption-module-update.patch
Judging by the feedback I get from Gentoo users, there is high demand for this :)
Thanks,
Daniel
