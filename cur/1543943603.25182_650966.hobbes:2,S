Thank you.
welcome to any discussion.

to be honest, I don't know anyone use netlink and why hope receive
low memory notify by netlink.
poll() is old way, but it works good enough.
and, netlink have a bit weak point.
end up, netlink philosophy is read/write model.
I afraid to many low-mem message queued in netlink buffer
at under heavy pressure.
it cause degrade memory pressure.
