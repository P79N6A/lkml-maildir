The reason is that it was not designed to do such a thing.  It was
designed to handle the character device lookup, and that's it.

Because the lifecycle of your device should be separate from the
lifecycle of the character device node, you should not tie the two
together.

You shouldn't, odds are there are other ways to grab the reference on
your device from outside of the character node, right?  Like the USB
probe/disconnect path?  So you should have an independant reference
count in order to handle all of the different ways the device can be
accessed.

True :)
I'll be glad to queue this change up for 2.6.29 if you are going to fix
up the v4l code to not break if I add this code.
