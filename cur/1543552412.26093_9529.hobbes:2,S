If the server is sufficiently busy, the reply WILL be delayed. It can
even be on the same host, it just may not get around to a reply immediately.
Authority is not equivalent to reply. The advantage of local files is
that the reverse lookup doesn't depend on ANY outside agency.

I think it requires a recompile of the syslogd source to make that
change. I grant that there isn't a runtime option for it (I do think
there should be).

Some do, some don't - Cray systems will shut down if the audit daemon
disappears. Syslogd on Linux is providing the corresponding facility,
at the current time. Neither syslogd, nor audit daemon are reliable on
SGI systems, trusted solaris shuts down - I believe. The normal solaris
is unknown since I haven't had time to fully configure either it or the
audit daemon yet.

I think that is a "don't care" option on AF_UNIX connections. Required
for semantic compatability, but not used.

I think it is only reliable on the local host. If a remote syslog
facility is used, then it may be dropped if the input queue becomes too
long.
