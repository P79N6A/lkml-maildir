Last time I checked, suspend2 was 15000 lines of code, including its
own plugin system and special user-kernel protocol for drawing
progress bar (netlink based). It also did parts of user interface from
kernel.
OTOH, that was half a year ago, but given that uswsusp can now do most
of the stuff suspend2 does (and without that 15000 lines of code), I
do not think we want to do complete rewrite of swsusp now.
