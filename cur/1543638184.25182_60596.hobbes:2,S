	You might want to examine:
ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com//pub/dist/booting/make-ramdisk/make-ramdisk-0.38.tar.gz
	This script builds an initial ramdisk that then switches to
another root (which you can also pass via a lilo command line argument
"root2=/dev/....").  It supports setting up /dev/loop devices for
encrypted root partitions, and you should be able to adapt it use
/dev/loop/nnn for non-encrypted roots.
	Note that I am not arguing whether the "sector remapping" code
should stay or go.  I don't know enough about that right now to have
an opinion.
