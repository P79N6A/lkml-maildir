I really need more info than that.
I want info like: -
PCI card in slot X, Is using [LNKA] which is being routed via IO-APIC to 
  IRQ Y using Edge triggered Interrupt.
And then I need a tool to be able to change those settings, to for 
example: -
PCI card in slot X, Is using [LNKF] which is being routed via simple PIC 
to  IRQ Y using Level triggered Active low Interrupt.
"lspci -vvvvvv" gives me some of the info, and on a working system, 
/proc/interrupts combined with lspci -vvvvv gives me all I need, but I 
need to be able to tinker with the IRQ rounting after boot up, to test 
what the IRQ settings should be, even if the kernel set them up wrong.
Cheers
James
