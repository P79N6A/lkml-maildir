This is most likely correct, I
just wanted to be sure.

When the IRQ/NMI interrupts the
ring0 code (kernel), since the
handler is also ring0, the interrupt
gate doesn't save the SS and ESP
when switching, so you miss the 8 bytes.
After looking at the code again I
don't think this can affect the
ptrace since the ptrace probably
never traces from an IRQ context
(I hope).
So I think it is safe to ignore my
previous comment. (if only perhaps
the "optimized" version of the patch
is to have a look)
