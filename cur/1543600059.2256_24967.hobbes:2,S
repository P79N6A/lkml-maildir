Sorry that came out wrong. You can in theory generate unaligned IP options this way, but the 
kernel handles this correctly using memcpy. What it doesn't handle is unaligned TCP options
(e.g. timestamps); which you can create using TCP option byte fillers.
Also the 4 byte alignment of the header doesn't help much when the driver didn't cooperate.
