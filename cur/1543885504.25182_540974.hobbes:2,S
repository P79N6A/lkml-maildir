Thanks for these fixes.  They look good at first glance but I will look
at them in more detail during the week (and hope that Dan can have a
look at them too).  I will get back to you once more before I commit
because I would like to split it into three patches (for
raw1394_compat_read, for write, and for compat_ioctl).
