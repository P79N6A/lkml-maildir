Hi!
> The following patch cleans up the i386 usage of <linux/init.h>.
> This remove <linux/init.h> from <asm-i386/system.h> which did not need
> it, <asm-i386/highmem.h> which only had it due to an extern using
> __init, which is not needed.
> This adds <linux/init.h> to <asm-i386/bugs.h> which actually has
> numerous __init functions and adds <linux/init.h> to 9 files inside of
> arch/i386 which were indirectly including <linux/init.h> previously.

  * Right now we initialize only a single pte table. It can be
extended
__init is usefull as a documentation... Perhaps adding /* This is
__init function */ would be good.
