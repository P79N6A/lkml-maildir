Right so if a prioriuty futex would have been taken from a process 
context and then an interrupt thread (or so no idea about RT) is scheduled 
then the interrupt thread could switch to the process context and complete 
the work there before doing the "interrupt" work. So disabling interrupts 
is no longer necessary.
