I don't think so either, but don't remember the exact cpu (but it was an
embedded system...)

I really doubt it.  See David's other message to you about this.  And
if you have problems, please report them on the linux-usb-devel mailing
list.  We have never had bug reports due to issues involving the DMA
requirements (with the exception of people finding drivers that were
trying to send data off of the stack...)
