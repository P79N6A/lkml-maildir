Under Linux writebacks have byte-sized granularity. If a page has been
partially dirtied, we save that information, and only write back the
dirty areas. As long as each system has restricted its updates to
within the 2k block that it has locked, there should be no conflict.
If however one system has been writing over the full 4k block, then
there will indeed be a race.
