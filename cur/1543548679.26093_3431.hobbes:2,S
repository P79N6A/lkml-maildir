This bug has not been fixed, I can still reproduce it (but not every
time). This is how it happens:
- INN (1.7.2+insync+other patches, the debian package I maintain) is
  running
- active is correct
- I post an article, which is filed with the correct number
- for *this group only* the high value is wrong and equal to the one
  in the active file I precedently saved (in some cases this does not
  happen and I can't notice anything wrong in the active file)
- I stop INN
- the whole active file is now 100% identical to the saved copy
And the file mtime has not been updated (this time since the precedent
day):
-rw-r--r--    1 news     news         3075 Sep 10 00:02 active
This happens on my personal workstation with plenty of free RAM and a
tiny UUCP feed.
Right now it happened after the daily expire run: I stopped INN and the
file on disk changed to the copy I saved before expire started.
