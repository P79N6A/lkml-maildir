All true, I just find having the config in the same location for all
kernels (in say /proc/config) is more convenient than having to resolve
the kernel name from another file or do /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/config
from a script. The kernel knows who it is, all others have to ask. It's
just one less step a program would have to take, not a major problem.
