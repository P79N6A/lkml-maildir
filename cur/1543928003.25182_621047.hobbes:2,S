Why should arch_has_single_step be a function-like macro?  I can't thing
of a case were this wouln't be a compile-time constant.  And given that
this is hopefully a transitionary ifdef because eventually all architectures
would use the generic code I'd prefer ifdefs in the code that clearly mark
this as transitional in this case.

And I don't think these should be provided at all as generic stubs. If
an arch doesn't use the generic code it simply shouldn't compile the
code using this.
Whats the reason for the user_ prefix btw, most architectures seems to
have these functions already anyway, just without the user_ prefix.
