i have released the -V0.7.30-10 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from the usual place:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this is a fixes-only release.
the most important fixes are the ones to the priority inheritance logic
(affecting the latency of RT tasks), discovered and reported by Esben
Nielsen. I also found two more PI bugs running the new pi_test2 code
from Esben.
Changes since -V0.7.30-9:
 - PI fixes:
   - the waiter->prio field caused wrong priority settings upon unlock, 
     resulting in PI bugs in the nested-locking case.
   - use rt_task() when determining PI tasks, not p->policy.
   - in the blocking-on-blocked-task nesting case both promote now-RT
     tasks to the pi_waiters list and queue them to the head of the wait
     list, and demote now-non-RT tasks from the pi_waiters list and 
     queue them to the tail of the wait list.
 - PI-debugging blocker device update from Esben Nielsen
 - module build fix: export user_trace_stop symbol, this fixes the error 
   reported by Florian Schmidt
 - tracer fix: in the default !freerunning tracing mode, if the trace
   buffer overflows (this is relatively rare, but can happen) then the
   tracer overwrote kernel memory that leads to lockups/kernel crashes. 
   Maybe this bug was also the source of the truncated trace bug
   reported by Mark H. Johnson?
 - reduce tracing overhead within schedule() when !tracing_enabled.
