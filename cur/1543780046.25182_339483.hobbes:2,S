When a packet is received from the kernel, this is first done by an
interrupt handler to just get the packet. Then the rest (forwarding) is
done by a tasklet. This tasklet can be run either by the softirqd (a
kernel thread) or at certain locations in the kernel. So this is not a
normal process and no it can not be preempted or scheduled out (it can
be interrupted by an interrupt though).
