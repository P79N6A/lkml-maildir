Right.

Yes, I think a lot of people out there are in the same position
as well.  Compiling kernels on one box that are destined for
other machines entirely, possibly for machines that they won't
even see it running on and won't know anything about.  Isn't that
one of the beauties of Linux?  Configurability and flexibility
without needing to know such gory details, and without having a
huge bloated kitchen-sink kernel.
Take care!
