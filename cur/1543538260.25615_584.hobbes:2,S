They will #GP, yes.  If you want to read %cr4 unconditionally you have
to be prepared to trap the #GP.

Indeed.  %cr4 was introduced in the P5; I believe it is probably a
valid assumption that if the CPU has CPUID it also has %cr4 (the later
486's which had CPUID also had VME, so they must have supported %cr4.)
