*.asm is nonstanard naming.  If we have to support case-challenged
filesystems, please ensure that the rest of the nonbroken world can
continue as they have done for the last few decades and live happily
unaffected by these problems.

You still need a case-sensitive filesystem to be able to create a root
filesystem for their embedded device.  I think you'll find that issues
surrounding caseful filenames in the kernel is the least of their
problems.
