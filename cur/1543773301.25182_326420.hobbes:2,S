Another wishlist feature I've seen is to have a mailing list archiver
attached to bugzilla that receives and stores the last month worth of
emails on the list.  At any time someone can login and:
     o  Bind an archived email to a bugzilla bug-report
     o  Create a new bugzilla bug-report from an archived email (with
        extra fields specified by the user).
     o  Add an archived followup email in a thread to the bug-report.
Once an email is bound, it is marked for permanent storage in bugzilla
(as opposed to the temporary one month storage for all emails).
The first time the "create" or "bind" options are selected for a given
thread, a post would be sent to the list indicating the bind, from the
bugzilla address for that bug.  Any followup posts that CC that address
will automatically be included in the bug database.  It seems that would
allow users to quickly and easily tie the bug database to the email
archive, although I could very easily be missing something here.
Cheers,
