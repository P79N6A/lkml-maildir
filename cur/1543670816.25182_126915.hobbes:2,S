  Did you use hdparm to enable unmaskirq and 32-bit IO on normal IDE?
  With lots of activity I find 8 sector IO to work better than 16,
and 32-bit IO with sync to be no slower than 32-bit IO without it, so
I put a line like this in /etc/rc.local for each disk on HPT370:
        hdparm -c 3 -u 1 -m 8 -a 8 /dev/hde
