Hello,
something in FUSE breaks serial devices.  I found this issue 
using gphotofs, don't know if any other FUSE impementation has similar
effects.  The problem is: from the moment the FUSE filesystem is unmounted,
a process that read()s on a serial device /dev/ttyS? gets an EOF
returncode.  
Here is the tail of the output from "strace -tt cat /dev/ttyS0" when the
FUSE fs was unmounted:
19:41:46.513143 open("/dev/ttyS0", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3
19:41:46.513373 fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0660, st_rdev=makedev(4, 64), ...}) = 0
19:41:46.513552 read(3, "", 4096)       = 0
19:42:49.854367 close(3)                = 0
19:42:49.860663 close(1)                = 0
19:42:49.860793 exit_group(0)           = ?
Found this on x86 with kernels 2.6.16 and 2.6.17.
Any ideas?
