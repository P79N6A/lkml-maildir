How can reviewers make an informed decision, when you completely failed 
to note:
* This breaks the primary userspace user of this header, ethtool(8)
* The patch was NAK'd (and I don't even get a "Naked-by:" header :))
* Despite knowing all this for quite some time, no associated userspace 
fix patch has ever appeared.
If you are going to break stuff, AT LEAST TELL PEOPLE IN ALL CAPS ABOUT 
IT, rather than providing the highly deceptive description as above. 
And be courteous enough to help fix the breakage, if you please.
	Jeff, ethtool maintainer
