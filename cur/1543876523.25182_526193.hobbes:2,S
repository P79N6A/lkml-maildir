Only advantage of CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START seems to be that one has got
capability to run the kernel from other addresses without modifying the
boot-loader. One can argue that now people should use a relocatable kernel
for such a feature. But for using relocatable kenrel, one needs to modify
grub, lilo and I am not sure if somebody is going to do that. Secondly, how
would one specify an address to a boot-loader to load image at?
On i386, somebody already found an interesting usage of CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START
where he was running his kernel above 16MB so that he can maximize on
DMA ZONE. Can't think of any usage for x86_64 at the moment but I think
down the line people might come up with such usages.
To me, retaining CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START gives added flexibility to the user,
at the expense of reduced simplicity. We should definitely change the type
of vmlinux to ET_DYN but at the same time it might still be worth to retain
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START option.

That would be awesome. Then vmlinux will be relocatable too. (Officially).

This looks better. I changed it in attached patch.

Thanks. I changed it in misc.c too.
Thanks

o X86_64 kernel should run from 2MB aligned address for two reasons.
	- Performance.
	- For relocatable kernels, page tables are updated based on difference
	  between compile time address and load time physical address.
	  This difference should be multiple of 2MB as kernel text and data
	  is mapped using 2MB pages and PMD should be pointing to a 2MB
	  aligned address. Life is simpler if both compile time and load time
	  kernel addresses are 2MB aligned.
o Flag the error at compile time if one is trying to build a kernel which
  does not meet alignment restrictions.
