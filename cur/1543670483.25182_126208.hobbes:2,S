Hello,
Well, my guess is that because i boot with nmi_watchdog=1 kernel boot option  ?? I don't really know.
This was what i used to troubleshoot hard lockups with previous kernels ( i may remove it now
as since a patch was made to fix that, everything runs smoothly :) 
Thanks,
Philippe

  |  I wonder what is the reason for all the NMIs? And why arent't the local
  | APIC interrupt counters in sync?
  | 
  |  With 2.5.66 I have twice as many interrupts on CPU1 as you. :)
