this is wrong. it lacked only alpha get_xpid().
sure, we didn't do that dirty games with /proc you did, so maybe this is 
why you have such a feeling.

it is not a problem at all and can be done.

Once again, our approach doesn't prohibit hierarchical pids.
But in addition to yours it allows to select whether weak or strong 
isolation is required.

sorry?

it is not a question to the approach itself, you see? so not an argument.

Uhhh... I see that you have no real arguments. Nice.
