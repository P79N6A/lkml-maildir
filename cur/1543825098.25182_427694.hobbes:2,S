No luck with "hdparm -d1 /dev/hda" ??

Mmm.. there's a curious line: "PIIXa: neither IDE port enabled (BIOS)".
Can you enable DMA in the BIOS?  The IDE driver seems to be unwilling
to set up the bus-master DMA (BMDMA) portion of the chip unless
it was already initialized by the BIOS (paranoia, I suppose, or maybe a bug).
