Hello,
I've using a 3ware 7810 IDE raid controller without problems thru 2.5.50.
Using 2.5.63, I'm now seeing %CPU > 90 for 3dmd, which is 3ware's
monitoring daemon.  Other than CPU usage, things work normally.
Any clues as to why I'm seeing this?
Don't have the source for the 3dmd, which is released only as a binary.
Thanks,
Ray
