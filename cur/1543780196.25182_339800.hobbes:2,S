This lot are all gcc-4 being silly about a declaration, as you noticed.
Still, there's no reason not to make the static functions declared at
the top of the file.

This is actually because -mm is slightly behind the scsi-misc tree.  It
looks like the hold_mcs parameters haven't propagated into the -mm tree
yet.  You should be able to correct this by cutting these three lines:
	.get_hold_mcs	= mptspi_read_parameters,
	.set_hold_mcs	= mptspi_write_hold_mcs,
	.show_hold_mcs	= 1,
Out of the code at lines 505-507.  You'll get a warning about
mptspi_write_hold_mcs() being defined but not used which you can ignore.
