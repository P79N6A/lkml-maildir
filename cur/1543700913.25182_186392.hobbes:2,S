In fact it is just the opposite. Set 3 was designed to be translated.
Look at the translated codes:
Q (10), W (11), E (12), R (13), T (14), Y (15), U (16), I (17), O (18), P (19).
Completely regular.
Now look at the untranslated codes:
Q (15), W (1d), E (24), R (2d), T (2c), Y (35), U (3c), I (43), O (44), P (4d).
Messy.
