Most raid (soft or otherwise) will usually do it. I don't know any SCSI
hardware which will do it reliably unless you go fibrechannel or SATA
simply because a dead scsi drive can and sometimes does hang the entire
shared bus.
The majority of the time the aacraid based cards will do what you need
(most of the time anyway) and can also do a lot of on the fly recovery
and management. The fusions can do some raid stuff of this nature. Most
of the newer hardware is going SATA however.
