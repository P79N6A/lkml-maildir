I just looked at the revision guide again, and I don't see why erratum
#78 would matter -- that seems to be saying that the bridge itself
doesn't have an MSI capability so it can't generate MSI interrupts
itself.  But why does that matter for devices below the bridge?
Anyway I have some HP DL145 G2 servers with 8132 bridges in them.
I'll plug an MSI-capable PCI-X card in and see what happens.  So far
I've only used PCIe cards in my systems (but MSI-X works fine there,
with nVidia host bridges).
