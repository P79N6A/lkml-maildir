Subject: [PATCH] wait4 PTRACE_ATTACH race fix

Back about a year ago when I last fiddled heavily with the do_wait code, I
was thinking too hard about the wrong thing and I now think I introduced a
bug whose inverse thought I was fixing.  Apparently noone was looking too
hard over much shoulder, so as to cite my bogus reasoning at the time.  In
the race condition when PTRACE_ATTACH is about to steal a child and then
the child hits a tracing event (what my_ptrace_child checks for), the real
parent does need to set its flag noting it has some eligible live children.
Otherwise a spurious ECHILD error is possible, since the child in question
is not yet on the ptrace_children list.
