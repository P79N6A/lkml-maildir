1. If I interpret these numbers correctly, then your scheduler is not work-conservative,
i.e. 766.74 + 766.73 >> 472.07 + 257.48
why does it slow down users so much?
2. compilation of kernel is quite CPU-bound task. So it's not that hard to be fair :)
   Can you please try some other applications?
   e.g. pipe-based context switching, java Volano benchmark etc.
Thanks,
Kirill
