I don't think anyone uses ioports > 32bit.  Certainly i386 takes an int
port as parameter to {in,out}[bwl] (and it really only uses 16-bits).
parisc uses 24 bits.  I don't know what the various ppcs do, but pci
bars can only be 32-bit for ioports.  So my opinion is that ioports
should be uint, not ulong.
