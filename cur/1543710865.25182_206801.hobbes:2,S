Me too, with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC.  We had a fatal bug around that.
However it seems that Neil's machine is dying with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y,
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n, for which we have no explanation.  It seems that
we're getting use-after-free errors against the pgd's.
Maybe it was the early-x86-cpu-detection.patch bug biting in two places -
let me brew rc1-mm1 and we'll see.
