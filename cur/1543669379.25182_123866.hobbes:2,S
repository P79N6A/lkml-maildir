Piet, thanks for the reply!
Some of the points that I found attractive (among other points):
  - Overall a smaller time to reboot and save the dump, and bring the
    system back to working state.
  - Does not require local disk to save the dump on the way down during
    a panic - works on a diskless system.
  - No need for a dump/swap device.
Looking at the MCLX site, the last patch is on 2.4.17 only. Also, the
PowerPC port is a bit broken. Is anyone maintaining this part of the
MCLX scheme, and is available else where?
Best regards,
-Arun.
