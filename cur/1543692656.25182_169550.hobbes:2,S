List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Kernel version: latest from ppc.bkbits.net/linuxppc-2.5
Symptom: keyboard diarrhea - single keypress == 3-7 characters.
I've tried reverting drivers/input/keyboards/atkbd.c back to v1.31, doesn't
change anything.
Haven't done much other debug, since i can't successfully login to the system
from console. 
Further information if needed.
Please cc me if you reply from linuxppc-dev, i am not on that group.
