No you're not...you're talking about being able to hack the software 
*and load it back onto the original hardware*.

The software license controls the software.  If the hardware has 
restrictions on it that limit what software it will run, then that is 
unrelated to the software license.
There is nothing stopping you from taking the code for the tivo, 
modifying it, distributing it, or even running it on other hardware.
Suppose I had some machine that will only run microsoft-signed binaries. 
  Would it be at all related to any software license that this machine 
won't let me run linux?
