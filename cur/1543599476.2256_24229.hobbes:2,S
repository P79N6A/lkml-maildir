ok the result of using the pcnet32 module was a hard lock of my kernel,
had to remove the card to be able to boot again....
that's the part where it stops:
Aug 29 16:32:24 kalman kernel: eth1: PCnet/PCI 79C970 at 0xe000, warning
PROM address does not match CSR address<4>eth1: Probably a Compaq, using
the PROM address of 00 80 ad 11 09 20
Aug 29 16:32:24 kalman kernel: pcnet32: pcnet32_private lp=d0e4b000
lp_dma_addr=0x10e4b000 assigned IRQ 10.
Aug 29 16:32:24 kalman kernel: pcnet32.c:v1.25kf 26.9.1999
tsbogend@alpha.franken.de
after that nothing moves anymore.....
BTW forgot to say that's its an 2.4.9 kernel (debian source package)
running on an AMD Athlon...
