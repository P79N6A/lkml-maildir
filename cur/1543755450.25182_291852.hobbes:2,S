Tim and I talked about this at the recent CELF conference. I have a
concern in that suspend-to-disk calls the suspend methods and then
(after the atomic copy) the resume methods. Since the copy usually takes
< 1s, and the suspend and resume methods both make two calls to
get_coms_time, that's an average of 1.5s per suspend call and 1.5s per
resume call - but if the copy does take next to no time (as normal),
it's really 1.5s + 2s = 3.5s average just for getting the time. I
believe Tim has similar issues in code he is working on. It's a concern
if your battery is running out and you're trying to hibernate!

My question is, "Is there a way we can get sub-second resolution without
waiting for the start of a new second four times in a row?" I'm sure
there must be.
