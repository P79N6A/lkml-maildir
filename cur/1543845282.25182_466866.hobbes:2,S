Sorry, I don't have oodles of disk space free to hold all the git
historical information (iirc, it's huge).  I could conceivably put it
together, but I'd been some help and time.  I am currently travelling,
but I do have my kernel test laptop with me.  Also, I am currently
staying in a building running off of solar power, so I need to be a
bit careful with power consumption.  I'll be in a place with AC power
in five days.  Lastly, I don't know how I triggered the problem.  I am
happy to try to reproduce it for you, though.
