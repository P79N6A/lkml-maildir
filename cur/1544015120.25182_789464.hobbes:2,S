get_device() and put_device() seem to be about the only things that are
interesting before device_add().
Don't know if a final put_device() in this situation

It isn't actually that big.  And the added complication could hopefully
be covered by comments about the caveats.
Actually, maybe it would be better for the firewire stack to move the
concerned stuff into a non-atomic context.  There are other things we do
in there and atomic context isn't very comfortable for all this.  But
that would be a much bigger change.

Well, at least code which allocates struct device can check for failure
and handle it, while the allocator of dev->p can't even check.  Unless
you change device_initialize() to return error status and add error
handling all over the place...
