For what it's worth, the last mm kernel which booted on my old P-II IDE
test machine was 44-mm2. With 44-mm6 and this one I get an oops on boot.
Unfortunately it isn't written to disk, scrolls off the console, and
leaves the machine totally dead to anything less than a reset. I will try
2.5.46 base after I apply the few patches needed to make it compile, and
send you my config if you think it will help.
2.5.44 and all 4[45]-ac? builds booted and ran.
This is just a "problem present" notice, I have no decent info for
debugging.
