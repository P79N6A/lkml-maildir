There has been a fix for this issue in the kernel source for quite awhile.
From as far back as the configuration utility in 2.4.22:
CONFIG_WATCHDOG:
 If you say Y here (and to one of the following options) and create a
 character special file /dev/watchdog with major number 10 and minor
 number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
It should be under Character devices somewhere.
Hope this helps,
Mike
