Oops, this is one of the mistakes Ben pointed out to me. 
interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(wait_queue head, timeout) overwrites the wait 
queue that we've already added ourselves to.  schedule_timeout() does the 
right thing here.  (interruptible_sleep_on_timeout doesn't really buy us 
much of anything we care about either, so it's find to stay with 
schedule_timeout)
