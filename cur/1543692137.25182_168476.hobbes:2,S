I don't know what to tell you.  When I compiled 2.4 (no detectable problems), 
I wasn't using the input (and in fact had it disabled).  Not necessarily a 
useful piece of information.  The symptom that I notice is software 
autorepeat going bananas when the hardware at least knows the key has been 
released and would not be sending hardware autorepeat events...
