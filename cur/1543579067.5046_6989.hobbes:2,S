Because "extract max" is a basic operation of a priority queue,
which I just do N times.

Yes, I know. that's why you see the "any set with a full order relation"
in there. That basically disallows using extra structure of the elements.
Notice that the radix sort you describe basically hides the log N in the
the representation of a number of max n (which has a length that is
basically log n). It just doesn't account for that because we do the 
operation on processors where these bits are basically handled in parallel,
and so do not end up in the O-notation. Any attempt to make radix sort
handle arbitrary width integers on a fixed width processor will make the
log N reappear.
Having said that, in the particular case of fd allocation, we DO have
additional structure (in fact, it's indeed integers in 0..n). So I can
very well imagine the existance of a priority queue for this where the
basic operators are better than O(log N). I just don't understand how
it can exist for a generic priority queue algorithm (which the
Peter van Emde Boas method seems to be. Unfortunately I have found no
full description of the algorithm that's used to do the insert/extract
in the queue nodes yet).
