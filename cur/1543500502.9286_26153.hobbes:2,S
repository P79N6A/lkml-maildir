It doesn't work very well.  I've got both my Linux boxes compiled that
way, and it's never worked. Between my two Linux boxes, both with
2.2.10, I can only mount from WS to masq.  Masq to WS mounts always tell
me "Permission denied...", with the WS logs telling me:
Jun 25 07:51:56 reliant mountd[460]: getfh failed: Operation not
permitted 
When I go from FBSD to Linux, everything works perfectly, except for the
filesystem thing--only what's n the physical partition gets mounted.
Frankly, Linux NFS leaves much to be desired, and needs to be either
rewritten or changed.  Tell me again, *why* did we go to much
vaunted-yet not working consistently knfsd?
I'm *really* working hard on my C programming, but it'll be a while
before I could write/rewrite an NFS daemon, so about all I can do is
point out the foibles and follies...
in my .config I have:
#
# Network File Systems
#
# CONFIG_CODA_FS is not set
CONFIG_NFS_FS=y
CONFIG_NFSD=y
CONFIG_NFSD_SUN=y
CONFIG_SUNRPC=y
CONFIG_LOCKD=y
CONFIG_SMB_FS=y
# CONFIG_NCP_FS is not set
Linux nfs is definitely an area that needs much work, and hopefully
those who can are going fast and furious to make it a decent filesystem.
