the actual issue is that the sys_mount() only allows
to pass 'positive' flags, and not 'negative' ones
(i.e. you can add flags, but you cannot remove flags
on a mount) which makes is somewhat complicated to
handle, especially with rbind mounts which would
replace/apply the given flags to _all_ vfsmounts
IMHO the best solution would be to have a new syscall
sys_mount2(), which passes a flag set to be added
and another one to be removed, but I doubt that will
be accepted ...

ah, no, I'm used to "we want A", "here is A", "no
we actually want B", "okay here is B", "no, no, you
got it wrong, make it C", "hrmp, okay here is C",
"sorry C is not acceptable, maybe A would be a good
alternative?" :)

although it is used in Linux-VServer and similar
setups on a regular basis, many folks not using that
consider it useful too, here are a few scenarios:
 - you want to enhance security by making certain
   parts of your filesystem read-only e.g.
   /etc /usr /sbin ... but you do not want to have
   separate filesystems for that
 - you have certain areas e.g. /var/spool/mail
   where you do not want atime to be recorded, but
   you do not want to disable it for the entire
   filesystem
 - you want to share a directory with other users
   in a read only manner (but you ahve to feed the
   data into that dir (somehow)
