I would certainly take you up on that offer.  I honestly don't think the
patch is ready for SMP, yet -- but we have to start somewhere.
apply the patch and set CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_PREEMPT to 'y' and let it
run.  Any errors, OOPS, etc, pass them this way.
Unfortunately, if the patch fails, its going to fall hard.  If the
preemption is imperfect during SMP, certainly you will hardlock.
It might help to enable CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCKS and
CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE -- these are present in the -ac tree.  The NMI
watchdog might prove useful, too.
But honestly, just telling me it locks on boot is useful, so whatever
you can manage.
I appreciate any help.
