Yes, I believe that's exactly right - so long as you do ClearPageReserved
from each of its constituent 0-order-pages before freeing the >0-order
page, in the <= 2.6.14 case.
You wisely remarked earlier that you'd not yet checked for memory leaks:
that is of course the complementary, less obvious, error to the troubles
you've been having so far: and I wish you luck when you come to check,
hoping that I haven't merely misled you from one side to the other!
