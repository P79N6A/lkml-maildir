Agreed, I just haven't touched it since you last mentioned it.

Fair enough.

Dunno about that. Probably should work more like the console code,
whoever registers first wins. Early boot will probably be the
exclusive province of serial for a while yet, but designing it in is
probably short-sighted.

Throwing all the stubs in a special section could work well too. Then
we could add an avail() function so that early boot debugging could
discover if each one was available. The serial code could use this to
kickstart itself while the eth code could test a local initialized
flag and say "not a chance". Which gives us all the architecture to
throw in other trivial interfaces (parallel, bus-snoopers, etc.).
