This is just to enable the error reporting of the device. One of the important
parts of AER is error recovery.
When an AER error happens, device will send an error message to root port. Then,
root port will notify kernel by interrupt. Kernel will print out error message,
and do error recovery to recover the related devices. Such recovery need device
drivers to provide a couple of callbacks. Documentation/pci-error-recovery.txt
has the detailed callback definitions and the recovery steps.

Usually, 3 callbacks are enough while error_detected is must.
        int (*error_detected)(struct pci_dev *dev, enum pci_channel_state);
        int (*slot_reset)(struct pci_dev *dev);
        void (*resume)(struct pci_dev *dev);
You could refer to the patches of e1000 drivers written by Linas, or just read
the source codes of the 3 callbacks of e1000 drivers in the latest kernel.
