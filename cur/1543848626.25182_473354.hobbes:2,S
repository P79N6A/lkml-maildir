Nobody doubts that it is possible.  But it is
a) potentially much expensive
and
b) an alien concept
to have the signal mask to set during the wait call implicitly. 
Conceptually it doesn't even make sense.  This is no event to wait for. 
  It a parameter for the specific wait call, just like the timeout.  And 
I fortunately haven't seen you proposing to pass the timeout value 
implicitly.

You still seem to be completely missing the point.  The signal mask is 
no event to wait for.  It has nothing to do with this that ppoll() takes 
the signal mask as a parameter.  The signal mask is a parameter for the 
wait call just like the timeout, not more and not less.

That's what I'm saying all the time.  Of course it can be supported. 
But for this the timeout parameter must be a timespec pointer.  Whatever 
you could possibly mean by "do not mix warm and soft" I cannot possibly 
imagine.  Fact is that both relative and absolute timeouts are useful. 
And that for absolute timeouts the change of the clock has to be taken 
into account.

That's not the same.  If you argue that then the syscall should have no 
timeout parameter at all.  Fact is that setting up a timer is not for 
free.  Since the timeout is used all the time having a timeout parameter 
is the right answer.  And if you do this then do it right just like 
every other syscall other than poll: use a timespec object.  This gives 
flexibility without measurable cost.
