Where is the current debugfs interface to dynamic_printk documented?
From the source in lib/dynamic_printk.c I deduced that
echo "set enable=1 <module_name>" > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_printk/modules
should enable debug output for module <module_name>, and verified
experimentally that this does indeed work. Is that already described
somewhere I just overlooked? If not, I would propose creating a file
Documentation/dynamic_printk.txt.
Thanks,
Tilman
