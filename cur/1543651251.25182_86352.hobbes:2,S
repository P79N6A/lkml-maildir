That isnt actually true. When you misfile it you mistakenly give it
powers. An untrusted document stuck in the secret drawer becomes seen to
have much higher value. It might for example lead the military to
believe a project is secret, make a decision on that basis and get
everyone shot because the opponents knew about it.
