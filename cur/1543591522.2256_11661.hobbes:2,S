Oh, thank you. That was very fast!
I use xine. To be honest, the procedure of how to create a raw device
is described in their FAQ. But it is not described, what the raw device
does, only that it provides a speed improvement.
Until today, I didn't know what rawio actually does. Strange that I didn't
come across on some information about it.
Was there a official announcement of the availability of this feature?
Is some more detailled information about the rawio existing?
