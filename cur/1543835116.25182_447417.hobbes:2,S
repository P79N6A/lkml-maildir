Heh... yes, hwmon already has voltage, current, and more importantly,
a maintainer.
I'd still prefer batteries to go into /sys/class/battery/... they are
really different from lm78-style voltage sensor and I'd not expect
battery applet to understand all the fields "normal" hwmon
exports. But conventions developed by hwmon group look sane and
usable.
Actually I do not see "hwmon infrastructure" to exist. Every driver
just uses sysfs directly. I'm not sure that the best option --
"input-like" infrastructure can make drivers even shorter -- but
perhaps just directly using sysfs is best for simple task like a battery?
Jean, any ideas?
