It's something between a misdesign and a misconfiguration of the ESC key.
In other words, many unices make ESC generate ^[, the general
terminal escape character that is _also_ generated by keys like "up",
^[[A.
MS-DOS, or rather QBASIC's, Turbo BASIC's and other implementation of
keys, does not have this "bug": here ESC generates "\x1B" and "up"
generates "\x00H" IIRC. There is no key defined to generate "\x00".
=> All fits nicely.
So I see two steps:
 - making ESC generate something else than ^[, or making function
   keys do something else
 - fixing the terminfo description and the xterms
 - possibly creating a new termtype ("linux2" or "xterm2") so as to
   not tamper with compatibility
Then text-console graphic applications (ncurses, slang, etc.) would
not need to wait the defined one second for an escape sequence to
complete.
HOWEVER, unix people probably _had a reason_ to make ESC generate
part of what function keys do. Should my UP key go broke, I could
still - though probably tedious - reproduce it by hitting the three
keys ESC [ A. Problem, as pointed out, is that ESC has long been used
by the majority of people back then for something else than doing
terminal sequences by hand: DOS, apps, games, Windows GUIs, and,
I suppose, even X11.
