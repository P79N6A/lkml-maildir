Hello,
	Recently (on May 16, locked 3c905B with 2.4.5pre2) I asked
about a problem with APIC. I see that some recent changes fix problems
with Via 82C686* chipsets. What about Via 8633/8233 chipset. Is it really
supported, someone successfully running SMP box? Is "... Using IRQ router
default..." ok for this chipset?
Regards
