You don't need a solution if there is no problem.

In both of your examples (including the one below), the same thing 
applies.

chown root.root /usr/local/cgi-bin/somescript
chmod 755 /usr/local/cgi-bin/somescript
---/etc/su1.priv---
alias somescript /usr/bin/nice -n -5 su wwwrun -- exec /usr/local/cgi-bin/somescript.pl
ask never
allow wwwrun prefix somescript
---
ln -s /usr/bin/su1 /srv/wwwroot/cgi-bin/somescript
If you need the same command for a group of users, you can use a wrapper 
scritp that will look at the $HOME variable (which is set from 
/etc/passwd)

perl -e'exec("/bin/sh");' would grant nice privileges to anybody, and 
that's not nice!

Not for running processes.
