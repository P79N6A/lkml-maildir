Why would a driver create an interface before it has the needed
firmware loaded?

What kind of network driver does create an interface for a
non-functioning device? That sounds like a bug on its own.
If a driver binds to a device, it should just have the firmware already
loaded, and not wait until its used. What's the reason for such a
behavior, to let a driver pretend it can handle a device, but it doesn't
even know if all the needed pieces are available on the system?

The underlying issue are the driver authors, that's not so easy to
fix. :)
Well, 10 seconds are just to short for userspace to react on some
setups, from tiny boxes which are busy, to 512 CPU boxes enumerating
thousands of devices, all had problems here. Any timeout for a
firmware-request is just a broken concept, the request should wait
forever, to be fulfilled or canceled from userspace when it's ready.
