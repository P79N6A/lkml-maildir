New features are easy, they usually result in changes to the config 
file. You can learn a lot with "diff" that way.
However, you really need to read the patches to see what they are 
supposed to change. That's a long and thankless job, but it's a wiki, 
right? So ask a few people to just look at parts of it and write 
comments on what they see. Few for filesystems, few for networks, stuff 
like that. And a few to look at "other."
If you do all the work it's not a wiki it's a blog...
