I have a USB2 hard drive and it crashes on hdparm -t /dev/sda.
The Gentoo 2.4 kernel worked perfectly with it (although it only was 8mb/sec).
Is this a known problem?  It also crashes on a 'du' to the root dir.  
Basically anything that pushes the disk.
This is on Kernel 2.6.0-test2 and test3.
I have not tested on previous kernels.
After the crash, I can't access /dev/sda at all.
