Actually, Sridhar's code (mentioned earlier in this thread) *does* drop
incoming packets that are not 'critical', but unfortunately you need to
completely copy the packet into kernel memory before you can do any
processing on it to determine whether or not it's 'critical', and thus
accept or reject it.  If network traffic is coming in at a good clip and
the system is already under memory pressure, it's going to be difficult to
receive all these packets, which was the inspiration for this patchset.
Thanks!
