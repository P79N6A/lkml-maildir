Sorry.  Who said it should not be tested?  How else it could get
'default compiler'?  If the gcc-3.0 would start giving errors
on some old code then it could be gcc bug.  But this rwsem code
is couple of days old.  It is good to let it through stricter
error checking, I guess.  This rwsem is very in-flux code.  eg.
2.4.4-pre2 did not compile.  ac[56] with um-arch do not compile.
If nothing else convinces, then AFAIK both Linus and Alan
expressed interest in seeing reports of using newer gcc's.
Remember, gcc-3.0 is in freeze since Feb 12.  (Ofcourse they
also suggested against using random CVS snapshot as default
compiler in distrubution).
