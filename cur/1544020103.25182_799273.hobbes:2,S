Alignment is defined in the architecture psABI documents. 
Unfortunately, many of them were written before the 'long long'
type became part of the C standard, so it's not strictly guaranteed.
AFAICT, the alignment of __u64 on x86 is the same as the alignment
of 'double' by convention.
However, the problem is well-understood: x86 is the only one
that has a problem in 32/64 bit compat mode. m68k has similar
issues with 16/32 bit integers, but those don't apply here.

If a compiler was using irregular structure alignment, all sorts of
library interfaces would break. The kernel ABI is only a small part
of the problem then.

Agreed in general, but the whole point of this particular patch was to
provide compatibility with an interface that has been part of XFS for
many years.
Linux already has a better interface for new users (sys_fallocate), so
changing the patch would not be helpful and not provide any advantage.
There is also no leak of uninitialized data here, because this structure
is only read, never written.
