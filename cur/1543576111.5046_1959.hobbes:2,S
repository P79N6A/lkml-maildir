Ehrm, did you really read my mail? Most people told me something like
"recursive exports are not supported" (actually, they are and they work),
and it seems nobody really read what I wrote :(
My problem is that autofs doesn't work. Example:
/	reiserfs
/fs	autofs
/fs/big	ext2
When I exportfs /, /fs AND /fs/big then I can mount /fs on another box,
but it is always empty, even if something (e.g. /fs/big) is mounted and
can be accessed fine the whole time. Automounting doesn't work, either, of
course.
Another (less grave) problem is that exportfs (and/or rpc.nfsd) require
network access and access to the volume, so they a) mount all automounted
directories (VERY expensive) and require network access (making all
clients NOT survive a reboot).
