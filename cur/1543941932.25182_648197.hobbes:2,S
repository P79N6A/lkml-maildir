Sometimes it's difficult to see what can go wrong due to a single patch that
just adds a #define. Sorry, I missed the lack of prototype for
generic_find_next_le_bit() and that we don't set GENERIC_FIND_NEXT_BIT,
just like s390.
And yes, usually I rely on the -mm autocompiler to catch things like
this, but this time it didn't work out...
