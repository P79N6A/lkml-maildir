If software is object-oriented is a question of design, not the
implementation language. So it is neither necessary nor sufficient to
use a (so called) "object-oriented language" to get (or not get)
OO-software.

You like putting the "read" function into the place of the "open"
function in a struct file_operations?
If you name your functions meaningful, you probably see it at the time
you write the code.
And if you do not see it during coding, you probably will see it on the
very first test run.
So the effect is at most moving initialization code and logic from a
the .c in a .h file?!
The unanswered question is: What does it actually buy?
Exceptions, STL, and most of the fancy features are not usable and must
be thrown out (you even have to forbid them and look after it).
The holds - more or less - for operator overloading (except in very few
cases).
So the usual C++-(and OO-) marketing propaganda does not help since most
features (including all standard run-time libs) are either not usable or
forbidden.
Yes, you get probably stricter type checking - most of this is in C also
doable.
