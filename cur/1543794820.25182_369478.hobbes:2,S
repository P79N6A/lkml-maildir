I assume they will rather completely drop development of the driver
instead of developing an OSS driver. I cannot imagine that the 'few'
people using Nvidia cards on some non-Windows systems are enough to
proceed developing the closed-source driver. Or maybe they just stop
developing the driver to hit us hard in the face! So we're left with
nothing than just some old closed-source crap. I think it's getting
even more realistic when a lawsuit is knocking on their doors. Don't you
think?
I use my Nvidia card without the Nvidia drivers for long time now. For
pure X without games and just GNOME and coding I have no need to run the
proprietary driver at all. But maybe for others (mostly for people with
laptops where you cannot simply change video cards due to a
vendor-designed form-factor) it could get worst. What is left for them?
Run non-X environments on the laptop? Even run Windows on it? Puh!
A damn stupid circumstance with Nvidia in the end...
