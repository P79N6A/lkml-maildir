So, Greg, you mean generic USB-Device support? instead USB-Host 
support as is in the main tree.
There is some nice work for this in the ARM-Linux kernel specific to 
the Strong-ARM chip, but I was able to adapt it to another ARM chip I 
was working on easily.  (Though not finished yet due to a bug in the 
USB-D controller h/w)  It's got the s/w to act like a ethernet device 
or a pure bit pipe.
Have you looked closely at arch/arm/mach-sa1100/usb* recently?  It's 
not far from being generalized.  The Zaurus I believe already uses 
this work to act like an ethernet USB device, and iPaq folks on 
handhelds.org have been using it for quite some time.
Thanks,
Shane Nay.
(BTW- Great to hear this is on the agenda for the mainline)
