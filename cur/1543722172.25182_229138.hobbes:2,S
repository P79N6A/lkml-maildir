What's the 'void *' for?  Hint: this has nothing to do with the virtual
address and DMA address returned from dma_alloc_coherent().
page_to_dma - converts a struct page to a DMA address for a given device
dma_to_virt - converts a DMA address to a CPU direct-mapped virtual address
virt_to_dma - converts a CPU direct-mapped virtual address to a DMA address
Each one well defined for our _current_ interfaces.

Please get away from your nopage implementation.  We've been around this
before with Linus, and the conclusion was that it's up to architectures
to provide a MMAP method for DMA memory, which _may_ use the nopage
method if and only if it is appropriate for their implementation.
There's just no way I'm going to implement a half-baked "nopage" function
for ALSA.
This is actually the same issue for some framebuffer devices as well -
which also need DMA MMAP to be correct.
