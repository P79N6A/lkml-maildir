Hi everbody,
Thanks for your replies.
Lemme explain my problem a little bit more .... I have
a thread that does exactly similar things in
kernel-mode and user-mode (depending on how you
invoked it; of course, the kernel one is forked using
kernel_thread(), and the user one is from
pthread_create()). The architecture-dependant stuff is
taken care of by extensive use of __KERNEL__ macro
testing.
This particular thread gets a packet of data, the
header of which contains address to where it should be
copying the payload associated with that packet. The
kernel-mode thread will need to decide how to copy
data into another process' address space, so will the
user-mode thread.
However I think my copy_to_user and copy_from_user are
failing since the kernel-mode thread is copying data
into another process's address space, and I am not
sure how to do this. Do the get_fs() and set_fs()
combinations let you do that? If not, then how do I do
it?
Something like when you invoke the ->write or ->read
functions, you need to copy the requisite data into
the buffer the application provided you with.
Thanks and regards,
Rock
