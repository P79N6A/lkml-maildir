In Alessandro Rubini's book Linux Device Driver(Second
Edition), Chatper 12, he said that "By accessing the
fields in the request structure, usually by way of
CURRENT" and "CURRENT is just a pointer into
blk_dev[MAJOR_NR].request_queue". I know CURRENT is
just a macro. Where can I find the definition of this
macro?
I just don't know how to get the struct request from
the request_queue(a request_queue_t struct). CURRENT
points to which field in the
blk_dev[MAJOR_NR].request_queue? Thank you very much.
Michael
