Do you mean constructs like:
        local_inc(&__get_cpu_var(var));
?
If yes then i think you are missing the point here.
Yes, local_t can be useful when something is in an object and we know only 
a local IRQ context can update it and we dont want to disable irqs or use 
heavy atomics.
But percpu_read()/write()/add()/sub() ops are about optimizing _percpu_ 
variables. local_t alone does not solve that problem - because to use 
local_t as a percpu variable you have to get to the address of that 
variable - and that alone is not well optimized.
Or do you propose some new API that would allow that?
