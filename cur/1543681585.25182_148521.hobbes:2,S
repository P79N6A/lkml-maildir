I was more concerned to see if the N1 patch added anything to the current 
behaviour, but that is abandoned work now so don't worry. I can address these 
further issues incrementally if you're willing to test them. My test boxes 
have been tamed but I need and appreciate greatly your testing.

With a max sleep avg of just one second you'll never starve X or xmms for 
sustained periods; but under load X will not be smooth getting jerky even 
with small bursts of heavy X use; that's why Ingo increased the max sleep avg 
in the first place... but that led to other issues...
