You know "disagreeing" with subsystem maintainer (and everyone else
for that matter) is not exactly helpful in getting patches merged. You
are free to believe whatever you want, but if you disagree on
something as fundamental as "do not put unneccessary code to kernel"
with me, it should be no surprise that I "disagree" with your patches
(*).

I'm not trying to paint you as a bad guy. But Mark said you are trying
to help, and in that context I'd read it as "trying to help mainline
development". And you are not doing that, you are developing your own
suspend2 branch, that has nothing to do with mainline. I think we can
agree on that one...

uswsusp is now reasonably stable. Of course, it was dangerous some
time ago. Every software is dangerous when it is young.

(*) Actually I can't "disagree" with your patches because you did not
submit any, in recent history.
