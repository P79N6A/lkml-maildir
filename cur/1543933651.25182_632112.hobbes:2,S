Via a kerneltrap.org article (problematic internet setup here currently,
non-C&P text terminal only) I could see that this is the patch which
removes the d_revalidate member and the corresponding proc_revalidate_dentry().
And this is the state that my 2.6.24-rc_six_-mm1 tree is in already.
So either it didn't help here or it broke again by some later change or
there's some dumb PEBKAC error here.

OK, I'll try to re-check manual, raw, bare-metal mounting (bind etc.) soonish.
"CONFIG_NETNS" as mentioned in the patch description actually seems
to be "CONFIG_NET_NS", BTW.
(which I DON'T have set at the moment, if this happens to make a difference)
Thanks,
