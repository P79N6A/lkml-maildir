I guess wagging was a bad analogy.  I was thinking in terms of the 
kernel being the main entity and the programs being peripheral in the 
sense that the kernel can exist without the programs but the programs 
can't exist without the kernel.

Yes, this is the real point is that the facilities provided by the 
kernel shouldn't be tailored/compromised to cope with the problems of a 
couple of buggy programs especially when fixing the programs would be 
trivial.  I don't think the importance of the program is an issue as I 
doubt that there is any program that is so important that its 
requirements dictate kernel design.

Far more important things than these programs have been "broken" by 
changes in the kernel (I know, I've had to cope with them getting 2.6.X 
kernels to work with Red Hat 9) but no one complains or suggests that 
the kernel should revert to its original behaviour.  Change is part of 
progress and has to be coped with not resisted for no good reason.
