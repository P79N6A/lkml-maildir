Shouldn't make any difference. Chuck is seeing this on readdir() pages
which, of course, don't suffer from problems of dirtiness etc on NFS.
I've noticed that the code that used to clear page->flags when we
added a page to the page_cache has disappeared. Is it possible that
pages are being re-added with screwy values for page->flags?
Cheers,
