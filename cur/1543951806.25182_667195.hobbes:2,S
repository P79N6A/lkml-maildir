He knows. Ext3 cannot recover well from massive loss of intermediate
writes. It isn't a normal failure mode and there isn't sufficient fs
metadata robustness for this. A log structured backing store would deal
with that but all you apparently want to do is scream FUD at anyone who
doesn't agree with you.
