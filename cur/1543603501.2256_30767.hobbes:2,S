floppies have lots of room.
I'd like to get a kernel, ramdisk, and some hw initialization code all
on a 256KB ROM.  I have my ramdisk down to about 14KB compressed.  I
have my hw initialization code down to 32KB uncompressed (and I might
be able to reduce that further). So I want something like a 192KB
(compressed) linux kernel.   
If I had that some of the hard problems of with linuxBIOS would just
drop away.
