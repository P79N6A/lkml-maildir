It will end up swapping out the two processes which already have
space in swap ... even if the 3rd process is idle.
In that situation you could argue for 2 things:
1) the kernel should reclaim space when swap is full
2) you need more swap
I guess we'll want a bit of both, possibly with 1) being an
optional thing (since swap fragmentation could well be as
bad for performance as swapping out the wrong thing).
