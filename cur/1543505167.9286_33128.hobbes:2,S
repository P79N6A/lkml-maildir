Nothing terribly bad will happen if a signal handler never returns (ie you 
won't get a crash).  The signal being handled is blocked until you return
so you can't overflow the kernel stack by recursing forever.  On the other 
hand that may make it somewhat inconvenient to do this.

Yes; the signal handler can modify the register state (including the program 
counter if you so desire) at the instant the signal was delivered.  So you can 
unthread the signal handler and make control immediately pass somewhere else 
without actually returning to the place where the signal was delivered.
See the sigcontext structure for details.  Exactly how you get at it is 
probably architecture dependent.
