How about moving the internals (i.e., what's not to be exported to
userland) from linux and asm elsewhere, then?
Sure, it means significantly more churn in the kernel, but there's
going to be a lot of moving stuff around one way or the other.
While at that, we could also split what's kernel internal for real and
what's to be visible to external kernel modules as well.  So we'd have
3 layers of headers, instead of two.  I'm not sure this actually makes
any sense though, since there might be lots of dependencies of headers
for modules on internal headers.
