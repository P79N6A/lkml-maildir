I've done some more testing on 2.2.6 now with some other hardware.
I've tried the same setup, but exchanged the GUS MAX with a
SoundBlaster AWE32, and the computer still freezes after a few
minutes. The SB card was configured completely different (i.e. on
other DMA channels and on another IRQ), so the freeze should not occur
because of resource conflicts.
I've also tried to insert another SCSI controller into the computer,
a Tekram DC390-U2W (PCI Ultra2 Wide). I connected the CD-ROM to this
controller, leaving the AHA1542 controller empty (but still plugged
into the computer). I didn't manage to get a lockup during several
hours of testing.
My `crash-test' is to read from the CD while playing music (reading
the entire CD and write it to /dev/null while playing sound off my IDE
HD).
This crash happens with all 2.2 kernels I've tried it on, compiled
with either gcc 2.7.2.3 or egcs 1.1.[12].
