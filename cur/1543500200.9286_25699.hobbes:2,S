 AFAIK, a binary only module for a linux kernel that is not the latest
 version is available at www.m-systems.com. They do not intend to release
 the source code. Though with their IDE emulation stuff, it should work
 without the specific driver as well, but then you pay more.
Search the archive of www.linuxrouter.org for more on the DOC. It's a
frequently discussed topic there.
