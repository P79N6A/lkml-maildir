What RT-related changes cause this?

In this terminoligy, you are calling 2.6.15-rc5 "legacy".  Which is not
true.

Huh?  Please point out these bugs in the mainline tree and we will be
glad to fix them.

The USB host controller drivers routienly allocate memory in irq context
as they are being asked to submit a new "packet" from a driver which was
called in irq context.  Lots of USB drivers also allocate buffers in irq
context too.
So, please, drop this line of argument, it will not go any further.
