 This is not a problem itself -- each CPU may have a separate GDT and/or
IDT.  We should not use task gates for NMIs but this still applies for
double faults.

 We could set up a handler similar to the one for the double fault.

 That would probably lead to a triple fault, but is it a real problem for
us?  It is possible to set up a reliable double fault handler so the
'Invalid TSS' handler would likely get never ever invoked.

 Just as I wrote earlier...
