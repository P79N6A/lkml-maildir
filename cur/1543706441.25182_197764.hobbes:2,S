I don't see how that is the case. devfs doesn't do anywhere near as good
a job exporting info about the system's state as sysfs, wouldn't dream
of disputing that. But to me, /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc and
/sys/bus/scsi/drivers/sd/0:0:0:0/block/dev are the same philosophy.

No, that's not what I mean at all.

No no, I'm not saying sysfs is setting /dev's naming policy. I'm saying
that no one is ranting and raving about how userspace should be able to
change the names of sysfs files using a userspace daemon. devfs
specifies a path in the kernel,

So how is that better? :) Not that I'm suggesting sysfs should have
device files in it, but why is it a winning point for sysfs to be able
to say "hey, look, I don't export a device file, but a file which
carries exactly the same information but with less utility, since you
have to use that information to create ANOTHER file".
My point was that both filesystems are exporting that information to
userspace, at least devfs does it in a way where the product is useful
with or without a userspace daemon.

But I wasn't arguing they weren't different, I was arguing that they
both have naming policy in the kernel. As long as the user can specify
their own names as well, why is it "naming policy in the kernel" to
specify a hardcoded path in /dev, but not if you specify a hardcoded
path in /sys?

Not even an extra step, more a different step. Not "more" work, the same
work in a different way. And it should because then you have a working
/dev with guaranteed names.
