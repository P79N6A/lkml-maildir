i've concentrated all the code into kernel/workqueue.c, and all the
interfaces into include/linux/workqueue.h - so you can simply copy those
into the 2.4 tree and it should just work. There should be no namespace
collision either. A O(1) scheduler tree is needed, due to
set_cpus_allowed(), but there is no other dependency i think.
