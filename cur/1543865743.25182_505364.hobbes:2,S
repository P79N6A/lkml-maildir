get-edid uses the BIOS, while the other two talk directly over the I2C
bus.
Try loading i2c-dev (I2C_CHARDEV); With i2cdump[1] you can read the EDID
block, which resides at address 0x50:
i2cdump N 0x50 (where N is the bus number)
If you are unshure about bus number try with all the available
/dev/i2c-* devices (you may want to unload HW monitor drivers first, so
you don't poke at random stuff).

[1] lm-sensors package, at least on Debian.
