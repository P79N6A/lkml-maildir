hi,
I have added some code to netif_receive_skb function.As linux kernel
is multhreaded , so there is no gaurantee than mine code is completely
executed without being disturbed by any other process .Timer interrupt
handler is an example of code which might interrupt execution of mine
code.
I just want to observe which processes are disturbing mine code .I
think i need to print EIP register values .How can i print cache
contents as well in linux kernel .Are there any tools available for
such purpose
thanks,
shahzad
