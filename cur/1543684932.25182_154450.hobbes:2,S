Justin,
I am going to try with the SCSI disk drive alone after diconnecting the
cdrom drivers.
I'll look into serial console and try to set it up.Do i need extra
hardware or cables to run serial console? any poniters or setup
suggestions would be welcome as i never used serial consoles before.
Regards,
Paul
