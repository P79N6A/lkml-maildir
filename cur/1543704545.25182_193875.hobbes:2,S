The cpu selection patch is perhaps a bit prominent and therefore the
first suspect in case of problems. After looking at yesterday's problems
(including looking through the .config's) I'd claim that my cpu
selection changes are definitely not guilty. Besides that it broke
"allnoconfig" I haven't yet seen it having big problems caused.
Your impression might be different, and you are the one who makes the 
decisions.
