Yes, but there are at least two important differences:
   * Hanshaking. The DMA controller must know when the peripheral has
     new data available/is able to accept more data. Thus, you need to
     specify which set of handshaking signals to use as well as which
     direction the data is moved.
   * One of the pointers often stays the same during the whole transfer.
I'm willing to give the drivers/dma framework a try, though, when the
time comes to forward-port the drivers that need such infrastructure.
