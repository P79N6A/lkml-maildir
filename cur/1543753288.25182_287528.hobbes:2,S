	Good question.  Probably someone jumping the gun a bit because
I haven't been very active on that driver lately.  I do tend to drop
off the radar for months at a time, depending on other projects and
engagements.  I haven't done updates to the driver in the 2.6 kernel
and, yes, it is broken.
	Marcelo integrated my 2.4 patches and I've got testers running
that code now.  I've got a 2.6 patch that integrates those fixes and
fixes some 2.6 problems.  In the course of working on the 2.6 patch
I stumbled onto another problem that had to be retrofitted back into
the 2.4 patch which, fortunately, made it into the patch I gave to
Marcelo.  I'm looking over a couple of other changes that went in with
that 2.4 update.  I'll try and get a patch out in a couple of days
against 2.6.10.
