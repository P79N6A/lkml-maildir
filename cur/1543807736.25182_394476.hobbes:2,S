Well, while I did explain this many times (*), I am still waiting 
for an explanation why Linux tries to deviate from nearly all other OS.
*) in case you like are on amnesia: without the mapping in libscg,
cdrecord could not be used reliably on Linux. And yes, I _do_ care
about people who run Linux-2.4 or older!
It seems that we should stop this discussion.
As long as the peeople who answer here are onlookers without the 
needed skills, it seems to be a waste of time.
