First. The kernel doesn't talk to the video device when X is running.
The X-Server does. Therefore, your question is not a kernel issue.
That said, if you are using gpm for mouse/cut-paste in dumb terminal
mode, try to execute gpm -k before you start X.
If that doesn't help, contact the XFree people.
