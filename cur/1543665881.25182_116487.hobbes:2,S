Larry, I don't mean to start yet another anti-bitmover, anti-bitkeeper or
anti-larry flame-fest, but I have to be honest that I am a little bit
worried.
You are giving us approximately 90% of our data in exchange for the one
thing that made using bitkeeper not a total sellout; the fact that the
revision history of the repo was still accessible without proprietary
software.
I honestly appreciate the work that you and BitMover do for the kernel,
but not giving us access to 100% of _our_ data is unacceptable to me.
Quite honestly, I think your move is to restrict the possible
alternatives to the BK client (the CSSC based ones like I and others had
done), which were able to extract 100% of the data, even if they
couldn't make use of it in the same way as bitkeeper. Atleast it was
there.
You've made quite a marketing move. It's obvious to me, maybe not to
others. By providing this CVS gateway, you make it almost pointless to
work on an alternative client. Also by providing it, you make it easier
to get away with locking the revision history into a proprietary format.
