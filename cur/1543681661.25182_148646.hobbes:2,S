Make sure you have a line in /etc/fstab for /dev/pts, like the
following:
none /dev/pts devpts defaults 0 0
My recollection is that I've seen this happen with at least some 2.4
kernels as well, so it's not a 2.6-specific thing. I may not be
remembering correctly, however.
Also note that some distributions will go ahead and mount /dev/pts
without having a line for it in /etc/fstab, so this isn't needed for all
Linux boxes.
