Theoretical only for low sizes of memory. If you have terabytes of memory
then this becomes significant in a pretty fast way.

Sorry not at all. SLAB and SLQB queue objects from different pages in the

As I sad it pins a single page in the per cpu page and uses that in a way
that you call a queue and I call a freelist.
SLUB keeps a few pages on the partial list right now because it tries to
avoid trips to the page allocator (which is quite slow). These could be
eliminated if the page allocator would work effectively. However that
number is a per node limit.
SLAB and SLUB can have large quantities of objects in their queues that
each can keep a single page out of circulation if its the last
object in that page. This is per queue thing and you have at least two
queues per cpu. SLAB has queues per cpu, per pair of cpu, per node and per
alien node for each node. That can pin quite a number of pages on large
systems. Note that SLAB has one per cpu whereas you have already 2 per
cpu? In SMP configurations this may mean that SLQB has more queues than
SLAB.
