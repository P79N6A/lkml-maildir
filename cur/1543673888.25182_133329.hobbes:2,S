NUMAQ is not supported by the generic subarchitecture anyways.
The only supported architecturs by generic are pc, bigsmp, summit.
In theory you could subselect them, but it's only a few bytes for each
so it's probably not worth the effort. Technically it isn't a big issue,
you would just need to add it to Kconfig (not sure how to do that cleanly), 
the Makefile and the probe table.
