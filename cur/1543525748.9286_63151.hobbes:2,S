Hi,
while fscking with vanilla 2.3.45 I am encountering errors complaining of short
reads ie. of block 2319760 indirect block of inode 66420.
I am using IDE, dma activated on a VIA 82xxx chipset.
These errors don't occur with 2.3.37 or 2.2.x
The disk is OK. The error is reproducable between reboots.
	Regards
		Oliver Neukum
