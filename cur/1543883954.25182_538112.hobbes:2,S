Thank you, Markus - you are a real fine and straight chap.
You should be team leader of this community.
BTW:
Are my latest attempts sent to you already involved in the latest development state
(Read: Is dvb-pll.c deselectable now without breaking support for lgdt330)?
I simply stumbled over that lgdt330 binding in module dvb-bt8xx.c, line 641 or so.
Anything else I resolved at least from my personal side.
A thousands of thanks to you and Trent - well done!
