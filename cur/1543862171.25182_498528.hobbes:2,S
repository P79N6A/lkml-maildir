Tuning the system to work appropriately for a given load is not a 
band-aid. I have been saying since 2.5.x times that filling memory with 
cached writes was a bad thing, and filling with writes to a single file 
was a doubly bad thing. Back in 2.4.NN-aa kernels, there were some 
tunables to address that, but other than adding your own 2.6 just 
behaves VERY badly for some loads.

Anyone who has a few processes which write a lot of data and many 
processes with more modest i/o needs will see the overfilling of cache 
with data from one process or even for one file, and the resulting 
impact on the performance of all other processes, particularly if the 
kernel decides to write all the data for one file at once, because it 
avoids seeks, even if it uses the drive for seconds. The code has gone 
too far in the direction of throughput, at the expense of response to 
other processes, given the (common) behavior noted.
