FYI, The current ff x86 sched_clock() [which you likely have, it's not
mainline] tends to warp backwards by 80-90ms during cpu freq changes
on AMD on one of my test systems. I haven't tracked down why it does
that yet. Intel or systems with no cpufreq or cpufreq not changing
frequencies regularly are not affected
