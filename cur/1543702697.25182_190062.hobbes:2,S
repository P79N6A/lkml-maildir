I sent that, but you can call off the bloodhounds, the perp has been 
apprehended and jailed.
Actually, there is a huge gotcha in make xconfig.  If, under busses 
early in the menu, you do not select ISA, even if your mobo doesn't 
have one, you MUST enable it before you can even see the i2c-isa 
options and turn them on in the i2c tree.  Bad dog, no bisquit, it 
should be shown and the help should say it needs the busses/isa 
enabled too.
Turned them both on and everything but the eeprom and temps is working 
in sensors output, minor details because the cpu temp IS being 
displayed by gkrellm just fine, as are both of the fan rpms.
Many thanks to Nuno Montiero for tickling me in the right spot with an 
email about that, to John Lash and Martin Schlemmer who were also 
helping me chase it down, and to the list for putting up with my 
whining.
