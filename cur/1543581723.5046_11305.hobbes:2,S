In a PC and if using lilo, you always get a lilo prompt (if so
configured) after the initial power on tests. Passing a "nologo" option
to lilo would seem a reasonable way to turn the feature off. The same
could apply to othe boot loaders and other archs. By the way, suse 7.1
has a graphical boot, no animation though, just a big penguin; some
hacked lilo version, maybe?
