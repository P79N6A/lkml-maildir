Hi,
Our ethernet driver performance is not so good in
powerpc machines. I have attached a link for a patch
and brief description below, which talks about 
alignment of dma memory for rx and tx buffers. 
So my question is, Will there be increase in 
performance on powerpc machines if I also align my 
tx/rx dma pointers?????
Description:
PCI bridge peculiarities mean the insufficiently
aligned DMAs perform terribly on Power4 hardware. This
hack copies and realigns packets to improve
performance.
