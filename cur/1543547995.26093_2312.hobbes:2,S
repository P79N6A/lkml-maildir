I wasn't intending to put it up for inclusion into the main kernel tree... I
think it is far better that it stays as a module, especially as it doesn't
require any changes to the main tree to be used, it can just be loaded when
one wants to use Wine.

It is actually proving very useful, at least to me... It allows me to use PVCS
(a horrible java-based version control system for windows only) at work whilst
running Linux. It also allows me to run MSDEV without having to reboot.
