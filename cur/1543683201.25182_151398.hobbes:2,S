Before I tried using streams, I just used write() to communicate with
the ptty, but I had the same problem. I found that if I put a read()
call before and after the write(), it worked. But why? Is this some kind
of I/O voodoo? How does the reading affect the writing?
You mentioned that things would improve if I let the parent read from
fd. Will this work using streams? I have tried opening fd in "r+" mode,
but in that case I end up reading my own data. Do I need to lay an
fflush() somewhere inbetween? What is it exactly that causes the data to
be sent to the parent?
I appreciate the help.
