It is even worse. Useless operation in data path. read/write will return
the error, if connection died in any case.

Not very much. But code becomes simpler.
Select() is better sometimes, f.e. when program uses signals
(and glibc uses signals _internally_ when multithreaded, breaking lots
 of things, do you know this? :-)). In this case you need to raclulate
remaining time to restart poll/read/write, linux select returns it.

It depends. The advantage of read/write with SO_*TIMEO is that
in all 100% of cases data arrive in time or you send immeadiately
and appear in right place and do not waste cache and cycles to exit from
select and to enter to read/write. Also, select() is pretty
suboptimal.
