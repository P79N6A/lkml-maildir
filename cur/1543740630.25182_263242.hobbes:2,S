Now I have some good news (that is, I hope that this is good news)
If I disable NUMA in 2.6.8.1, it works stable!
The same with 2.6.9, which is out for a few days: if NUMA is disabled,
everything's find, if NUMA is enabled, the kernel crashes (as described in
previous mails)
What is this NUMA by the way? Is it OK to live without? 
If you need some additional output, let me know. I can't promise to be
fast, though (as I said, this machine is in production use now)
Thanks for all help,
        Sergei
