Confused. I still think his patch incomplete. Don't we need the same check
in setup_rt_frame() ?

Yes sure.

context.vdso == NULL after mm_alloc(). I don't see a "good" arch dependent
function to clear ->sysenter_return (if we really need this). May be
flush_thread().

I agree, this problem is mostly theoretical, but I believe it is hardly
possible to document what the "quiet" time is ;)
How about
	 #define ARCH_DLINFO
	-do if (vdso_enabled) {
	+do if (VDSO_BASE) {
?
