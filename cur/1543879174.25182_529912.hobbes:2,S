Subject: [patch 11/31] Fix calculation for size of filemap_attr array in md/bitmap.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: Neil Brown <neilb@suse.de>
If 'num_pages' were ever 1 more than a multiple of 8 (32bit platforms)
for of 16 (64 bit platforms). filemap_attr would be allocated one
'unsigned long' shorter than required.  We need a round-up in there.
