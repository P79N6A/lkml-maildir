Linux 2.2 _is_ just an incremental upgrade from 2.0.
There are no spectacular new features in 2.2 that weren't in
2.0. There are a bunch of new drivers and 2.0 features are
enhanced (sometimes in rather extreme ways:).
If you take a look at the things that are scheduled for 2.3,
then you'll see what is needed for a new major version number.
I propose we wait with 3.0 until LVM, FS Journalling and other
advanced features (there's a load of them lining up for 2.3)
have been integrated...
