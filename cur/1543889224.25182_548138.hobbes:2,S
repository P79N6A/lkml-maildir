Stole reiser4 an idea.
These semantics are quite fragile. Until now, chdir is only possible
for directories (otherwise, -ENOTDIR), and opening a directory without
O_DIRECTORY gives -EISDIR. You can't just change semantics.
That said, with FUSE, something like this should already be possible,
should not it?
And looking at your example of foo.tar.gz/foo/bar,the tar.gz needs to
be read at least once to get at foo/bar.
