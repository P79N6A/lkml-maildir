This is exactly correct. 
TF should be re-enabled by the "is there work to be done at system call 
return time?" logic, which should mean that we go through 
do_notify_resume() (which will set TF_MASK) and return with an "iret".
We can't return with a sysexit in the TF case, and setting TF on the stack 
is thus useless.

Sounds like something is broken, but I don't see what.
I did check single-step over sysenter at some point (a long time ago), so 
this has worked.
