that's not what the OWAP documentation I was told to read said. it 
specificly lists a requirement to pause drivers before the clock change 
and unpause them afterwords.

but a constant added to both sides makes the relative savings less.

their measurements and graphs say otherwise.

what is it missing?
it lets you find out what modes are avialable and (in relative terms) how 
much capability and power is available in each mode
it lets you find out what the transition costs are from any mode to any 
other mode
