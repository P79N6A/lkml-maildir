	20 or 255 - not feasible (we'll get stack overflow from hell).
8 - probably can be switched already; anybody who hadn't converted their
fs ->follow_link() to new model will just lose; in-tree instances are
already OK with that and out-of-tree folks had at least half a year
of warning.
	Unless anybody yells right now, I'm switching it to 8 in post-2.6.16.
