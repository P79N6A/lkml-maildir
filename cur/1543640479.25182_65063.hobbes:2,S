That's exactly how my code works.

Found that out when I tested binding the agpgart driver.

Ok, I guess that makes sense.  My interface was primarily for special 
cases anyway.  What does need to be done is a user level program that 
finds and loads the proper modules automatically.  Maybe we could use 
the existing hotplug scripts or we could even start from scratch.  Maybe 
we should make a file in the source tree where driver developers can 
list their supported hardware IDs but more importantly documentation on 
the attributes registered into driverfs.
