Standards bodies typically get their supporting income from the sale of 
the standard specification in fancy printed pdf's.  As its a small 
market, the only way to survive is the highway robbery model where a 
copy is maybe over $1000 USD.  Its a bad model for the FOSS crowd as 
they may not have the bucks to spend on a real copy.  Generally, their 
copyrights are VERY well enforced by their shysters which compounds 
the issue.
All of our preaching is to the choir, as the standards bodies could 
care less, if you want a copy, pony up.  Thats life, unforch.
