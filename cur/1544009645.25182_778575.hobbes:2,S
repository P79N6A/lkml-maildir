He sent his original config in his first email - GEODE_MFGPT_TIMER was 
enabled. Its not always certain that there are MFGPT timers available 
(prior to about the middle of this year, most Geode BIOSes took all the 
timers for themselves).  But in any case the system should fall back to 
PIT automatically, so regardless of more advanced timers. the absence of 
a PIT is troubling.
