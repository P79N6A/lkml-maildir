And it will fail, locking is missing many parts of input core. Notice I
said _should_, not will ;) I was trying to paint how it should work when
we have proper locking and I don't want to use ff_lock to paper over
some bugs in the core.

Right, but if device was never registered there is no device node so noone
could start the timer and deleting it is a noop. Hmm, I think even better
place would be to stop ff timer when device is closed (i.e. when last user
closes file handle).

Yes, this is guaranteed.
