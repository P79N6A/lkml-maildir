I moderately prefer the C version, even if it is in a restricted
environment where care is needed to access global variables. I like that
it avoids multiple copies of the code and also find the structure of
what's going on is more obviously apparent (even to someone who has done
plenty of ASM mode page table frobbing in the past).
Anyhow, I don't feel all that strongly about it so if the opinion of the
early start of day maintainer(s) is strongly in favour of ASM I'll defer
to that.

Do you mean the native_pagetable_setup_start/done changes? I'm a bit
confused by not requiring obviously necessary changes -- I presume you
just mean that those changes are desirable but should be deferred into a
separate patch?
The C way doesn't inherently require those two changes to happen in the
same patch either -- probably worth splitting out if we go that route.
Ian.
