I'm going to say yes, based on the comments in sched.h:
/*
 * These are the constant used to fake the fixed-point load-average
 * counting. Some notes:
 *  - 11 bit fractions expand to 22 bits by the multiplies: this gives
 *    a load-average precision of 10 bits integer + 11 bits fractional
 *  - if you want to count load-averages more often, you need more
 *    precision, or rounding will get you. With 2-second counting freq,
 *    the EXP_n values would be 1981, 2034 and 2043 if still using only
 *    11 bit fractions.
 */
That is, 10 bits of integer is 1024, the remaining 11 bits being used
for fractions.
Thanks,
Nish
