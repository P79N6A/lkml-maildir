Calling shmget( key, size, shmflg ) with size = 0,
I got an error EINVAL. The below patch fix it,
please apply into 2.3.41+shmfs14 patch.

And now I have a question:
I guess almost all users have no shmpath (default: /var/shm),
and they maybe make a dir and have to mount it.
IMHO, it is better to change that sysv shared memory works
samely, whenever shmfs is not mounted. Is it feasible, 
or only my mistaken ?
