A whole new fs in userspace just to handle a slightly odd sector size on a
bog standard iso9660 filesystem? I hope youre kidding... or maybe you
are under the impression that XA mode files / vcd filesystem is some
entirely new beast that is completely different from iso9660 in which case
I can see arguing for userspace fs.
For an audiofs its understandable, but for XA mode files on a standard
iso9660 filesystem it seems rather silly.
