this? 
+                       /* until radix tree lookup accepts end_index */
+                       if (page->index > end)
+                               continue;
I dont see why that would make a difference. 
What seem to happen is that when we get near the EOF, the min calculation 
which could make sense, doesnt:
min(end - index, (pgoff_t)PAGEVEC_SIZE-1)
and some unnecessary cycles will be spent doing search at __lookup_tag(). And 
using i_size_read() is more meaningful anyway.
What I'm trying to do is make wait_on_page_writeback_range() do reverse
search instead ascending. Since we write pages in ascending order, doing 
the wait on reverse order makes sense and will avoid possibly tons of 
wakeups.
Naive me tried to implement that using pagevec_lookup_tag(), but I'm
convinced we need pagevec_reverse_lookup_tag() do reverse search
on the radix tree. I'll try getting that done on the weekend.
What you think about it?

Oh yes, right. I was too excited :)
Fixed version with changelog, against 2.6.8.1-mm2:
filemap_fdatawait() calls wait_on_page_writeback_range() with -1 as "end" parameter.
This is not needed since we know the EOF from the inode. Use that instead.
