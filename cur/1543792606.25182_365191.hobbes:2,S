Hi all,
I haven't noticed this until today...but my load average has been 
skyrocketing past 3.00 since Monday, which is when I upgraded to 
2.6.14-mm1. I've got 3 Software RAID-1 arrays across 4 SATA disks, and 
all 3 processes are locked in an uninterruptible sleep.
What's interesting, though, is I haven't noticed a degradation of 
performance at all, and all the arrays work absolutely fine. They aren't 
rebuilding or doing anything strange that I can see.
Any ideas?
Cheers,
Chris
