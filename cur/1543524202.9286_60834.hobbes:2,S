Depends on how clever the motherboard chipset / ISA bridge is.
Any DMA-capable ISA card in an Alpha, for example, is quite happily capable
of scatter/gather DMA, and it doesn't even have to know a thing about it.
The PCI/ISA bridge will perform any mapping it's asked to - but at the moment 
Linux doesn't use that capability, and just sets up a static mapping to the 
first 16Mb of RAM, AFAIK
