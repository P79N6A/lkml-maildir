My first problem was that 'SIGSTKFLT' is undefined for sparc64 but
referenced in a couple of macros in kernel/signal.c.  My temporary fix
was simply to take SIGSTKFLT out of the macro definitions.
The problem I now have is that the definition of the
'dequeue_signal()' function has apparently changed from taking 2
arguments to 3 arguments.  All of the calls in the arch/sparc64/kernel
directory use 2 argument calls.
Does anyone have a fix?
thx,
