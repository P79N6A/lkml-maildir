I'm not surprised, sadly.

Don't look at me for naming, when in doubt I call stuff 'simple' (see
arch/ppc/boot/simple, or CONFIG_PPC_SIMPLE_SERIAL, and I'm sure I'll do
it again).  If people like kernel/kgdb.c (and arch/$(ARCH)/kernel/kgdb.c
or kgdb-stub.c) that's fine with me, so long as they're all consistent.
