Not entirely within the multipath virtual device, that's the problem.  If it 
could stay somehow all within one device driver then ok, but since we want to 
build this modularly, as a device mapper target, there are API issues.

We moved on from the IDE writeback problem a while back, this is about SCSI 
multipath, and the idea is to keep the SCSI device queues full so that 
barrier requests can flow through instead of stalling.
To be honest, after poring through the SCSI docs I'm not sure whether SCSI 
supports the behavior I want, which is for dma transfers on post-barrier 
requests to run in parallel with media transfers of pre-barrier requests.
With SCSI there are two mechanisms that could be used to implement barriers, 
ordered commands and task lists; patches posted to date use the first method.  
The ordered method sets an attribute on a SCSI write command that says "must 
be executed in order submitted" implying that all previously submitted 
commands have to finish before the ordered command begins to execute.  (Note, 
this is not necessarily optimal if the barrier is just supposed to separate 
two groups of writes and the order within the second group doesn't matter.  
Also, it implements a stronger barrier than just read/write, so reads will be 
blocked as well.)  What is not clear to me is whether or not the drive is 
allowed to read the buffer into its cache before the ordered command becomes 
active.  I'd appreciate comments from any SCSI gurus that happen to be 
reading.
Regards,
Daniel
