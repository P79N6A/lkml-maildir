On the contrary.  I did some digging and asking and thinking about this
for the Unreliable Guide to Kernel Locking, years ago:
wmb() means all writes preceeding will complete before any writes
following are started.
rmb() means all reads preceeding will complete before any reads
following are started.
mb() means all reads and writes preceeding will complete before any
reads and writes following are started.
This does not map to all the possibilities, nor does it take advantage
of all architectures, but it's generally sufficient without getting
insanely complex.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
