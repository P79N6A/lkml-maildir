Subject: PATCH: sd.c -- fix for testing WP bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Attached is a patch to linux/drivers/scsi/sd.c which fixes the behavior of
the code which tests the WP bit.  This patch is generated against
2.4.0-test8-pre4.
Specifically, thsi code fixes the case where the device in question does
not have a page 1 (I found one, this is how I found the bug).  Since we're
not really interested in page 1 (we just want the header data), this patch
makes the code request "all pages" (code 0x3f) with an allocation length of
only 8 bytes (the length of the header data).
This works on all devices I have available to test.  I see no reason why it
might break other devices.
Linus, please apply.
