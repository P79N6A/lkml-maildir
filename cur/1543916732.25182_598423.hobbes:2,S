Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Virtualization config cleanup: The real patch 1/3

OK, I screwed up and sent the old 1/3.  This was supposed to be 1/3, and
there is no 3.  I'm stupid.
Be nice to get acks from Jeremy and Zach as it's their original
penmanship.
Cheers,
Rusty.

Normalize config options for guest support
1) Group all the "guest OS" support options together, under a PARAVIRT_GUEST
   menu.
2) Make those options select CONFIG_PARAVIRT, as suggested by Andi.
3) Make kconfig help titles consistent.
