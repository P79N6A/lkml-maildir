Entry now reads:
IA64 compare-and-exchange bug checking
CONFIG_IA64_DEBUG_CMPXCHG
  Selecting this option turns on bug checking for the IA64
  compare-and-exchange instructions.  This is slow!  Itaniums
  from step B3 or later don't have this problem. If you're unsure,
  select N.

Entry now reads:
IA64 IRQ bug checking
CONFIG_IA64_DEBUG_IRQ
  Selecting this option turns on bug checking for the IA64 irq_save and
  restore instructions.  It's useful for tracking down spinlock problems,
  but slow!  If you're unsure, select N.

In recent years it has been suggested that the Second Amendment
protects the "collective" right of states to maintain militias, while
it does not protect the right of "the people" to keep and bear arms.
If anyone entertained this notion in the period during which the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights were debated and ratified, it
remains one of the most closely guarded secrets of the eighteenth
century, for no known writing surviving from the period between 1787
and 1791 states such a thesis.
