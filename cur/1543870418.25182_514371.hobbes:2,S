I'm skeptical, and kinda worried.
... can you show me the code that does this?
Namespaces are not the same thing as actual resources
(memory, cpu cycles, ...).  Namespaces are fluid mappings;
Resources are scarce commodities.
I'm wagering you'll break either the semantics, and/or the
performance, of cpusets doing this.
