Hi!
I think you should implement the noexec feature in the (v)fat module. In 
former versions it worked, and there were no executable attributes on the 
files. Now noexec takes no effect, and the undocumented showexec parameter to 
the fat module still makes the .com, .exe, .bat files executable. If one has 
no dos emulator, then it's annoying. Maybe there should be a binfmt_dos stuff 
which, when compiled, makes executable files have the executable filemode, 
but under no other circumstances.
