Re: mapping HW to ACPI C-states.
Right, it is fair game for the BIOS to map a "shallower" hardware C-state
to a "deeper" ACPI C-state.
Re: CPU state
All C-states preserve the CPU SW programming state.
(eg. while it may be saved and restored in HW,
 it appears to SW to be always intact).
Re: C3 guarantees that the cache contents stay intact
This is both true and false, depending on how you use the word "intact".
If "intact" == "stays valid in cache", then no, this not guaranteed.
The HW reserves the right to flush some or all of the L1 and L2
caches whenever it wants to --
this includes both HW and ACPI C2 and C3 states.
If "intact" = "cache consistent", then yes, this guarantee is true.
The way the guarantee is implemented varies by generation.
Older systems would lock the bus in C3 to assure
the processor was woken up for DMA to snoop.
Newer hardware simply wakes the cache to snoop
without waking the cores, or if it flushes the caches
then it doesn't have to snoop at all -- which also
counts as "cache consistent":-)
