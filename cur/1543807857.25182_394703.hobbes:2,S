Agreed.. here are some issued we learned from other projects that had
similar interception points.
Having a central umbrella object (let's stick to the name container)
is useful, but being the only object through which every access has to
pass may have drawbacks..
task->container->pspace->pidmap[offset].page   implies potential
cachemisses etc.
If overhead becomes too large, then we can stick (cache) the pointer
additionally in the task struct. But ofcourse that should be carefully
examined on a per subsystem base...

Another thing to point out is that container's can have overlaps.
C/R should be a policy thing. So if each "subsystem"

is represented as a NAMESPACE, then one can pick and choose as a
policy how these constitute at a conceptual level as a container.
You want something migratable you better make sure that
container implies unique subsystems.
Maybe you want to nest containers, but only want to create a
separate pidspaces for performance isolation (see planetlab work
with vserver).
So, there are many possibilities, that might make perfect sense
for different desired solutions and it seems with the
clone ( CLONE_FLAGS_NSPACE_[PIDS/UIDS/SYS.../FS] ) one gets a solution
that is flexible, yet embodies may requirements.....
