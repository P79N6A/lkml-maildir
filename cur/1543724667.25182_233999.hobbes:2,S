Fine, but it seems to me NX bit patch wasn't properly integrated with
VM_DATA_DEFAULT_FLAGS.  In fact, if you hadn't changed the x86 version
of VM_DATA_DEFAULT_FLAGS and instead had in mm/mmap.c replaced the
macro with (VM_READ | VM_WRITE | VM_MAYREAD | VM_MAYWRITE), then
things would have behaved exactly right with my patch applied and the
logic would make much more sense.
There would also need to be a small change to arch/ia64/mm/init.c, but
I'd be happy to take care of that.
