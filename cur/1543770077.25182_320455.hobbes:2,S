I am not a kernel developer, but I think the way this particular
pull request is worded can be made much more friendly to Cogito
users (that probably is the rest of the world except you, me and
Linus ;-).  They use URL fragment notation to express the branch
head, like this:
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/libata-dev.git#new-ids
At least for me, eyes always skip to the "rsync://..." part
immediately after seeing "Please pull.." part.
For Linus I am willing to volunteer updating git-pull-script to
take the same URL fragment notation, but as Jeff correctly
pointed out it already takes the "branch" name as its second
parameter so it probably would not be necessary.
