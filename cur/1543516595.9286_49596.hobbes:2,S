Subject: [PATCH][procfs] procfs cleanup - against 29-pre1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/11/19/136

New stuff:
	* last things outside of fs/proc/*.c went dynamic.
	* proc_register() is not exported anymore.
	* proc_unregister() is completely gone.
	* cleanup of proc_fs.h
	* internal procfs cleanup - not complete yet, but getting close.
Remnants of the previous patch:
	* proc_symlink(), proc_mknod() and proc_mkdir() added. Use them to
register such animals (from drivers, etc.). Treat with care, since there
may be interface changes yet.
	* ->get_info() method lost the last argument. _NONE_ of the
instances used it. Ever. Typical names were 'unused' and 'dummy'. How the
hell did it stay around so long - hell knows. Probably nobody checked it.
	* /proc/scsi/scsi writable again.
	* Featurectomy: unlink in /proc is gone. Good riddance, since it
made oopsing the hell of the system trivial. With memory corruption,
yodda, yodda.
	* ->readlink_proc() is no more. Use proc_symlink() to create such
entries. If you _really_ need dynamic symlinks - tell. Nothing in the
official tree did. The only symlinks outside of procfs proper were in
/proc/ide/ and they are merrily handled with proc_symlink() now.
	Folks, _please_ be careful with that - beta code and all such.
Patch is on ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/proc-patch-34d.gz
