I wanted something higher level than C. Forth looks
like C to me. I wanted something with build in support
of complex structures and automatic memory management.
I see no reason to replace one C with another.

I didn't. It's possible optimization, but it will not
give any good. The syntax of LISP is much simpler than
Forth (this another reason I chose LISP :-), so parser
is very small.

At the start of the project I tried to design my own
small language (just for security system). At this
point I understood that I didn't want to settle with
anything less than universal language. The idea to
invent some language and write VM for it didn't appeal
to me. I wanted to make a security system, not a new
language. I wanted language to be as simple as
possible. LISP had the simpliest syntax from all
languages. So I found small lisp interpreter (kind of
real time - without garbage collector which stops
execution) added string and bit operations, modified
it to be placed in the kernel.
Ok, it was my marketing claim about sysadmins :-)
Sysadmins use web interface to configure polices and
don't deal with LISP at all.
LISP is for those who want to change security Models
only.
