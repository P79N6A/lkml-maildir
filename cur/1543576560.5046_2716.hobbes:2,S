It's being aligned properly.
if you have a continuous array of objects that are each 8 bytes, you
create a mask that's FFFFFFF8, then if len=7, instead of doing an
operation on the last byte of the first thing and the first 7 bytes of the
second, the above expression will add 7, making len 14, then normalize it
to the last valid object address, 8.  And if you start with a valid
address, you get that same address back.
