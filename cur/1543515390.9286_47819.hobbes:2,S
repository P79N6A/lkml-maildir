Hmm... Indeed, it makes the robust implementation awkward it seems.
Another question then:  can it be any use at all to be able to open
/dev/ptmx if /dev/pts is not mounted ?  Can one use a master pty
without ever opening the corresponding slave ?
If not, then the kernel could reject the open("/dev/ptmx") if
the file-system is not mounted (yeah, it sounds ugly as well, indeed).
Unless Jamie's `dup2' trick can be used, of course.
