The patch is correct, obviously; the comment is not: the real comment 
should be:
Enable the use of P6 NOPs on Pentium 4
The CPU_FAMILY field is really the minimum CPU family that can boot the 
kernel (that's why there is no 5; we don't have any i586 family 
dependencies not encoded by CPUID bits.)
