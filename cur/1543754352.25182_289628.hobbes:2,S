I just put in a Gigabyte GA-K8NF-9 motherboards (nforce4 chipset), and 
the USB ports are not working.  It recoginizes the ports but no devices 
attached to them (mouse, external hub).  These devices worked properly 
with my previous motherboard.  This happens with both 2.6.10 vanilla and 
2.6.10-1.1109_FC4 (2.6.10-rc2 based).

I have tried booting with acpi=off and pci=noacpi with no change.  Any 
help would be appreciated.
