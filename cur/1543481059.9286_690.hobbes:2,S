Not sure if this is the right place but, I am willing to offer the use
of my system for testing of the x86 based kernels.
The system specs are as follows.
Alton M558 430TX motherboard
American MegaTrends BIOS dating 1/03/98 - Flashable
AMD K6 PR166MMX CPU
96MB EDO RAM (72p SIMMs)
4GB /dev/hda1 = Win98 using FAT32B (Will split to add Slackware if
needed)
2GB /dev/hdc1 = Native Linux RedHat 5.2 (willing to alter as needed)
    /dev/hdc2 = 63MB native Linux swap
32X CD-Rom = /dev/hdd
2 3.5 floppies
3Com ISA 3c509-TP eth0 - connected to a Win98 native computer
S3 8c325 4MB PCI Video Card
SkyWell 3Dfx 4MB Voodoo 1 3D Accelerator
(Modem is a winmodem so useless here)
NEC MultiSync 2V Monitor
I have experience with both Slackware (Having started running it when
it was 1.0.9)
and with RedHat (since it was Hurricane).
If not, just ignore this email.
