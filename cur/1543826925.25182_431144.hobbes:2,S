Right.  OHCI was just an example though ... there are lots of other
platform drivers for PXA.  I'm not sure they all check for platform_data
before succeeding in their probe() methods.

Looked OK to me.
That's the kind of approach now used with OMAP and AT91, and which IMO
would be appropriate to use for most platform devices ... that is, don't
register devices that the board doesn't have.  One additional nuance:  if
the kernel doesn't have that driver configured, that's another reason not
to bother registering its device.
