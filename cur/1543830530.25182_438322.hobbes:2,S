Despite what it might look like unix domain sockets do not live in the
filesystem.  They store a cookie in the filesystem that roughly
corresponds to the port number of an AF_INET socket.  When you open a
socket the lookup is done by the cookie retrieved from the filesystem.
So except for their cookies unix domain sockets are always in the
network stack.
Which means it is a royal pain to create a unix domain socket between
namespaces.  Which is the generally desired behavior.

Unless I am mistaken this is something that can only be created (given
my describe semantics) when you create the container.  So if you want
it you got it but you can't create it if you never had it.
