Because it doesn't make sense. For one, if you have 1GB of
swap you don't want processes killed when you have "only"
100MB left.
Secondly, think diskless or swapless machines. In this case
the "swap full" yardstick is completely unusable since the
backing store for stuff is the filesystem and not swap (same
for mmap()ed files, etc...).
Besides, nobody will accept the fact that processes get killed
before the system runs out of memory ;)
(just watch the flamewar that will follow anyone seriously
proposing to do this)

OK, now envision this happening at 4AM on a "critical" mail
or webserver. You don't want the system to remain hanging until
the sysadmin walks in at 9AM...
