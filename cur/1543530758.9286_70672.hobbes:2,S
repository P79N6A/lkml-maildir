Ahh, this is a problem.
The only other fix I can think of is to put blocking interupts and
enabling interrupts inside loop, i.e., interrupts are opened and
closed for removing each child process.
The overhead is obvious.  I am not sure if it is worth the benefit
anymore.

On the other hand, why would an interrupt routine need to acquire
the read lock on tasklist_lock at first place?  For synchronizing
with other interrupt routines in SMP version?  Or the same functions
acquiring the read lock need to be called by both interrupt handlers and
regular kernel routines?
