Hi Vitor,
  I've had exact same trouble since upgrading one of my hosts to 2.2.14 ;
(in fact, 2.2.14 + reiserfs + idepatch + 2.2.14aa1).
it had very slow TCP transfers with another host on 2.2.12. I've tried several
kernel combinations, and it shows that this problem comes from the 2.2.12
kerenel because the slow down is observed only when the traffic sender is
under 2.2.12 and the receiver is 2.2.14. Other kernels such as 2.2.10 are
OK for both hosts communicating with any of these kernels. I remember about
someone saying a long time ago he had slow downs between Win98 and his web
server under 2.2.12. This problem seems solved in 2.2.14.
if it persists with you, the fix is probably in andrea's patch which I included
in my kernel.
Cheers,
Willy
