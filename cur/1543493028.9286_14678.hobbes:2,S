  I just upgraded my printer server to 2.2.5-ac6.  I can see  this 
in /proc/devices:
Character devices:
  1 mem
  2 pty
  3 ttyp
  4 ttyS
  5 cua
  6 lp
  7 vcs
and a few more.  Whenever I try to do an "lpr /etc/printcap"  I get this
in my /var/adm/messages:
Apr 15 21:31:46 wally kernel: lp0 out of paper 
There is plenty of paper in the printer however.  I could print on the
last kernel all fine and dandy.
