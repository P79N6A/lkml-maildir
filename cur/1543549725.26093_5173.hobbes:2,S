Correct.

readelf -w dumps debug info but only if you compile with dwarf, -g
alone is not enough.  Objects compiled with dwarf are a lot bigger and
the readelf -w output is messy to parse, it is probably not justified.
For a process that is not going to run very often, using etags, cscope,
sourcenavigator, lxr or other such tool to find the variables is
acceptable (says he who will not be doing the work ;).
