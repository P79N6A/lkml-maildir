Subject: [PATCH 00/20] vm deadlock avoidance for NFS, NBD and iSCSI (take 7)

Yet another instance of my networked swap patches.
The patch-set consists of four parts:
 - patches 1-2; the basic 'framework' for deadlock avoidance
 - patches 3-9; implement swap over NFS
 - patches 10-13; implement swap over NBD
 - patches 14-20; implement swap over iSCSI
The iSCSI work depends on their .19 tree and does need some more work,
but does work in its current state.
As stated in previous posts, NFS and iSCSI survive service failures and
reconnect properly during heavy swapping.
Linus, when I mentioned swap over network to you in Ottawa, you said it was
a valid use case, that people actually do and want this. Can you agree with
the approach taken in these patches?
