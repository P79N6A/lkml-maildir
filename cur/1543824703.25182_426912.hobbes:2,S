I really don't want to push the x86 emulator idea, especially when 
kernel gurus that I respect very much, such as yourself, seem to be 
against it.
It just seems awkward that everyone thinks its fine to have a 30Kb ACPI 
interpreter in the kernel that loads a DSDT and executes it, but a 30Kb 
x86 emulator that loads a video ROM and executes it is completely absurd.
Some PC's need an ACPI interpreter to function properly, some video 
cards need a x86 emulator to function properly.
Why is everyone so keen on keeping the video drivers crippled, but no 
one says "ACPI should be done from user space with user mode helpers"?
