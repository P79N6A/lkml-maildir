We are going in circles here.  I think you are missing my point.
Consider the following
[[
Thread A: calls library function which creates a timerfd file
descriptor.
Thread B: calls select() on the timerfd file descriptor.
Thread A: calls library function which wants to:
   a) modify timer settings, and retrieve copy of current timer
      settings, and later
   b) restore old timer settings.
]]
This seems a quite reasonable use-case to me, and the existing
interface simply can't support it.
Cheers,
Michael
