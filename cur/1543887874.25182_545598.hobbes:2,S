Thanks for reporting this - I gues this took some time to
find the root cause of the problem.
Albeit fixing it seems simple I will consider it for a
while. In the kernel we use several tools like:
awk, grep, perl, ls, rm, mv, cmp etc and then
we should audit all of these to check if similar
things could occur.
If someone steps up to do the check (including
all the tools I missed) I would be very grateful.
