I find that fragile, see the way I implemented do_anonymous_page, other
places always do page_add_rmap under the page_table_lock, but there's no
reason to require that, the swapout code already checks explicitly for
page_mapped after taking the page_map_lock, it has to do that anyways,
so I find it nicer to do it like the above and in do_anonymous_page.
