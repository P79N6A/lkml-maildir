Sounds right.  Still like the owner of a file it can happen that some
containers are more correct than others.  Especially in the context of
mount merging and the other sophisticated caching that happens in NFS
this increasingly sounds like something that belongs in the cred as
that is where it is used.

Matt could you look at what it will take to do the right thing from
the network namespace side of things as well?  I believe it is going
to require the same level of understanding of the interactions in the code
to get there.
For the network namespace we should cache it at mount or server
startup and use it until we are done.  In a network namespace context
there are good reasons for that because talking to 10.0.0.1 on one
network may not be the same machine as talking to 10.0.0.1 on another
network.  NFS reestablishes tcp connections if the connection to the
server breaks doesn't it?  Or is that left to user space?
