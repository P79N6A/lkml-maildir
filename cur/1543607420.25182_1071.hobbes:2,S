After upgrading our fileserver to 2.4, I can't seem to get the ISDN
card to work. I think that's because the kernel is using the APIC to
route interrupts, such that my BIOS configuration "used-by-Legacy-ISA" 
is no longer in effect. 
I tried disabling the APIC with the following results: 
Local APIC disabled by BIOS -- reenabling.
Found and enabled local APIC!
Kernel command line: auto BOOT_IMAGE=linux ro root=302 BOOT_FILE=/boot/vmlinuz disableapic
as far as I can see, the code to print "local apci disabled by bios"
is not called if "disableapic" is on the commandline.
This is linux-2.4.10 that I got with SuSE 7.3
