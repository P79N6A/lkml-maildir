Use /dev/dsp - it works (for me). Or does viavoice always use /dev/audio?
By the way - I got digital in/output nearly working. Including 
32bit input (up to 24bit sound and probably things like trackmarks
available). There are some problems with lost data, though. If someone
is interested in half-working patches...
