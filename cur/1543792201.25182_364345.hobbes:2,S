Please don't try to make me update over http. Either point to master 
(which is not accessible by all), or point to git://git.kernel.org/. Or do 
both..
And if you do the latter (or, in fact, rsync or http for others), please 
make sure that you delay your "please pull" sufficiently that the contents 
have actually mirrored out, because otherwise, if the mail comes in while 
I'm in merging mode (like right now), and I try to pull, I may not have 
anything to pull at all just because it hasn't mirrored out yet.
A side comment (this was true with BK too): I prefer not to see 
unnecessary two-way merges, since that just makes the history much 
messier. So

is _probably_ unnecessary, since by definition the "trivial" tree should 
basically never have anything that could cause clashes (so if I just pull 
on it, it should merge fine even without you doing the merge the other 
way).
Anyway, I pulled, but now we have two merges instead of one, which is kind 
of pointless and unnecessary history complexity.
