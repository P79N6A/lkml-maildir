That's what i would think too at first.  What's confusing me is the fact that 
it is affected by priority.  Which means preemption can solve the problem.  
If i run the mp3 player at nice -n -20, i get no skips.   Why else would that 
be if not that preemption is dictating that freeamp's process gets whatever 
it wants when it wants ?   
My question is why does freeamp need to be at -20 nice just to do it's thing 
when logic dictates that it should be dbench that skips and is throttled down 
when run at the same priority as freeamp and not freeamp, since freeamp isn't 
trying to abuse it's resources.   
I mean, if renicing the process allows it not to skip, what else is going on 
if it's not preemption,  isn't that what the purpose of the priorities are - 
preempting lower priorities?  Or is nice something totally different, 
separate from priorities?  
I'm not exactly seeing how renicing it to -20 and the kernel letting freeamp 
do what it wants over anything else does not fall under the definition of 
preemption.  It cant possibly have nothing to do with preemption of 
preemption directly effects it.
Ok, so maybe i'm wrong and it has nothing to do with preemption, if then what 
exactly is allowing freeamp to play perfectly when run with nice -n -20 and 
not at normal 0.   And why is that the default behavior of the kernel ?  It 
seems quite unfair in a multiuser-multiprocessing system.
