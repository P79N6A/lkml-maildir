True. This problem also occurs, when diald is not used. For example - when
the interface ppp0 is up and the routes via ppp0 are set, killing -SIGKILL 
pppd does not clear the interface and the routes, but killing -SIGTERM  
does.
The same problem appears with other serial network interfaces - eg. SLIP
with dip or slattach (BTW, killing slattach with any signal does not cause
interface removing :)). Well, dear kernel hackers, is this a feature or
a bug? ;) (this happens with all 2.2 and also late 2.1.x kernels. 2.0.x
are OK). Hard to believe, that nobody noticed that earlier.
