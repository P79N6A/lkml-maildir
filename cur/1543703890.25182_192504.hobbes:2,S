This seems like a problem that a lot of power-management issues have. 
(At some point, linux may want to suspend itself after inactivity.  Both 
RT tasks and some interactive tasks may want to supress that.)  Why not 
add a SIGPM signal, which is only sent if handles, and which indicates 
that PM event is happening.  Give usermode some method of responding to 
it (e.g. handler returns a value, or a new syscall), and let 
/sbin/hotplug handle events for tasks that either ignore the signal or 
responded that they were uninterested.  This seems be close to optimal 
for every case I can think of.
