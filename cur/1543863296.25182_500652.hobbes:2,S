40 minutes stress test now and no exception yet. What's interesting is
that ata1 saw exactly one interrupt with irq_stat 0x0, all others that
might have get dropped are as above.
I'll keep it running for some time and will then re-enable the return
statement to see if there's a relation between the irq_stat 0x0 and the
exception.
