No, you just need a statically linked init program.  (Which can be a shell 
script using a statically linked shell.  For testing purposes it can be 
statically linked against glibc, it'll just be a bloated pig.)
I have a /tools directory that builds uClibc executables.  (Like Linux From 
Scratch Chapter 5: extract it as /tools, export PATH=/tools/bin:$PATH, and 
then build software as normal.)  I can post that somewhere if you'd like, or 
you can extract it yourself out of my firmware linux build 
(

)...
The switch_root program in busybox is still being banged on (by me).  I 
haven't quite worked out what to do about /dev/console yet.  I'm thinking if 
it's not there, keep the one from initramfs, but haven't implemented that 
tweak yet...
You also have the option of putting a single static node (console) in the /dev 
directory you're going to overmount.  It shouldn't hurt anything at present.  
And if nothing else, it'll confirm where it's trying to get the sucker 
from...

Klibc didn't, or the kernel didn't?

From initramfs, you could try:
mount -t sysfs /sys /sys
CDEV=`cat /sys/class/tty/console`
mknod /dev/console c $(echo $CDEV | sed 's/:.*//') \
  $(echo $CDEV | sed 's/.*://')
Bit of a chicken and egg problem if it refuses to run /init if it's not 
already there, though.  We're heading towards fully dynamic devices, but not 
quite there yet...

You don't need root access to make an initramfs configuration text file. :)

I did something like that, only from scratch:
http://www.landley.net/code/firmware
I'll probably release version 0.8.10 later today.  (Still need to make an 
installer for the bootable version before I can call it 0.9...)

Presumably, either via initramfs or from init/main.c
