A slightly off-topic question, tasklet_kill(t) doesn't try to steal
t from tasklet_head.list if t was scheduled, but waits until t completes.
If I understand correctly, this is because tasklet_head.list is protected
by local_irq_save(), and t could be scheduled on another CPU, so we just
can't steal it, yes?
If we use worqueues, we can change the semantics of tasklet_kill() so
that it really cancels an already scheduled tasklet.
The question is: would it be the wrong/good change?
Oleg.
