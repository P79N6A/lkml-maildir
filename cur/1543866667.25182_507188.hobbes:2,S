Ah - cool. The average time we have to wait is probably far greater than the
fork overhead, microseconds versus milliseconds. 
However, and there probably is a good reason for this, why isn't it possible
to do it the other way around, and have the *child* do the work and the
original return to userspace?
Would confuse me at lot less in any case.
