With _TMP faked in the kernel and one whole zone ignored, this is what I
get:
Zone to ignore	|	Result
------------------------------------------------------------------------
THM0			OK (10 cycles)
THM2			"kernel panic! attempted to kill init"
THM6			Hangs (4th cycle)
THM7			OK (8 cycles)
So THM6 seems healthy, but THM0 and THM7 (and maybe THM2) interact
badly.  If I unload THM2, THM6, and THM7, then it's okay (previous
experiments with faking _TMP but with only THM0 loaded).  But unloading
THM6 is not enough.
The kernel panic for the don't-load-THM2 kernel is very strange.  I had
another kernel panic while doing another set of tests, which I also
couldn't explain.  The only difference between the no-THM0 and the
no-THM2 kernels is:
