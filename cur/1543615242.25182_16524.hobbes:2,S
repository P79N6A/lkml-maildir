 I think you've just answered your previous question - there are more
than one because its generally more convenient.  If you're using
horsepower for power then you should probably be using
horsepower-hours rather than BTUs (which are an admittedly silly
unit for most things).
You have: horsepower hours
You want: btu
        * 2544.4336
        / 0.00039301478

 Centigrade/Celcius have little to recomend them either - Kelvin is
the way forward, or Rankine.
