yes. Note that a prototype exists already: take a look at Tux's "work 
atom" infrastructure of how you can build a relatively straightforward 
state-machine that can be programmed and can be driven even from IRQ 
contexts. Via that i implemented fully asynchronous IO for networking 5 
years ago, and programmed it to handle HTTP and FTP protocol server 
logic, fully asynchronously. (For block IO it also does emulation of 
event handling via the 'cachemiss' kernel threads. State-machine driven 
filesystems are quite hard - but not impossible in the long run.)
It would be a natural thing to extend that fundamental concept to 
user-space as well. /That/ i'd call a generic, grounds-up event handling 
infrastructure. That would be a worthwile unification point for all 
existing IO APIs.
