Subject: 2.5.60: .o or .ko for CONFIG_MODVERSIONS?

	I just tried to build 2.5.60 with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.
It tries to build modules with the .o extension instead of .ko,
but "make modules_install" still expects modules to be have a ,ko
extension.
	Building with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS generates modules with a .ko
extension.
	I assume this is a bug in the newly restored
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS option, although I'd be happy to have modules use
the .o extension again.
