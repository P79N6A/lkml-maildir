I may be old school, but if you ask me, and if you *really* want those 
events, yes. Reason? Unix's everything-is-a-file rule, and being able to 
use them with *existing* POSIX poll/select. Remember, not every app 
requires huge scalability efforts, so working with simpler and familiar 
APIs is always welcome.
The *only* thing that was not practical to have as fd, was block requests. 
But maybe threadlets/syslets will handle those just fine, and close the gap.
