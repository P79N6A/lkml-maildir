without explicit dual licensing this is a trap yeah... it's far far
nicer to just make it explicit that it's dual licensed and that you
expect all patches are also dual licensed unless they also remove one of
the licenses (several dual licensed parts of the kernel have such
language if you're looking for example text). Otherwise its very much an
unclear situation and with licenses it's just better to be very explicit
and clear.
