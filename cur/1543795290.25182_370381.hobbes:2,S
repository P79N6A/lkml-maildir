While you're at it why not print a big loud warning that says not to
post the Oops to LKML, and instructing the user to reproduce with a
clean kernel, if the P flag is set?  Presumably the reason for the terse
output is to get the maximum possible debug information on the screen,
but we don't care about stack traces for tainted kernels anyway.  
Something must need fixing, as the volume of tainted Oops reports shows
no sign of diminishing, and the users aren't getting any less pissy when
you tell them to come back with a clean bug report.
