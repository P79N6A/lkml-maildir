The bug with the RSS limit patch is that I forgot to
change the exec() code, so when init is exec()d it
gets an RSS limit of zero, which is inherited by all
its children --> always over the RSS limit, no page
aging, etc.
I need to find the cleanest way to add the inheriting
of RSS limit at exec time and send a patchlet for that
to akpm...
