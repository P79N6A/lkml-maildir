Well, those times don't quite work for my PowerBook.  If we fixed  
suspend-to-RAM to reinitialize devices in parallel then it would  
easily hit 0.5 second transition times, but even now it's only at  
most 2 seconds.  Also once in a while I'll be too hasty plugging my  
USB devices and manage to hardlock one of the USB busses, but that's  
an isolated USB driver suspend issue.
And it's certainly not called "standby", because the box can  
literally remain asleep for 7 days on a full charge, versus about 5  
hours when just idle with wireless, backlight, and HDD off.
Cheers,
