   I don't think that is a common case relevant for performance. I
   seen it only as a case that we must handle without losing
   stability.
Hint: smp_flush_tlb_page()
Current kiobufs never need to do that, under any circumstances.
This is not by accident.
I don't see what the big deal is in requiring that user applications
do their own locking to protect page contents being modified in one
thread while a direct I/O from it is happening in another thread.  I
also don't see why any bug with kiobufs can't be fixed without the
expensive and complex pinning.
