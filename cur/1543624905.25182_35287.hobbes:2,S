Subject: MCE hangs on 2.4.19-pre3-rmap12g

In 2.4.19-pre3, Marcelo added CONFIG_X86_MCE (Machine Check
Exception).  I'm running from Rik's bk available -rmap12g tree.
I've tried enabling this option on both a T20 (IBM) and an i8k (Dell).
(I became interested in the option when one of them started having
flakiness which I briefly thought might be heat related).
Both laptops hang very early in the boot process after emitting the
message:
    Intel machine check architecture supported
Kind of a drag since the keyboard isn't alive yet, so power cycling is
your only option at this point.
I'm not particularly concerned except that the help for this option
ends with the sentences:
    Similarly, if MCE is built in and creates a problem on some new
    non-standard machine, you can boot with "nomce" to disable it.
I think that "creates a problem" understates the observed "prevents
your machine from booting".
    MCE support simply ignores non-MCE processors like the 386 and
    486, so nearly everyone can say Y here.
This reads like an encouragement when there should really be a
warning.
Here's the cpuinfo if each machine.  Perhaps one of the x86
cognoscenti can tell me that I'm a dolt, that the flags: like clearly
indicates that CONFIG_X86_MCE can never work.
