That's not a NACK.  The cd "$HOME" and ulimit calls done by the login 
process (more precisely, by a shell profile) are quite different from the 
mkdir/cd the thread started with.  Who creates a new directory in his 
shell profile?  I assume the mkdir/cd analogy is a case of a person doing 
a mkdir and cd in a running shell.  (That is indeed analogous to what one 
would like to do with a private mount).
When you said "by the login process or by wrappers like nice," in response 
to my pointing out that setnamespace would need to be a shell builtin 
command, I assumed you were talking about putting it in the code that 
execs the shell as opposed to in the shell profile, thus eliminating the 
need for a shell builtin.
But the important thing is just to recognize, as you say explicitly now, 
that setnamespace has to be shell builtin command for 
setnamespace/mknamespace to be analogous to mkdir/cd.  That was my 
original statement, if somewhat indirect:
>> >> >mknamespace -p users/$UID # (like mkdir -p)

That
