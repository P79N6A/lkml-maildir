Well, that's the problem, isn't it?
The best I can come up with is to suggest that all the info be captured in
a bugzilla report so that at least it doesn't get forgotten about.
I suppose that other options are
a) try to fix it yourself.  I'll take the patch and as long as we make a
   big enough mess of it, someone who knows what they're doing might fix it
   for real.
b) If it was a regression, identify the offending commit and we'll just
   revert it.
