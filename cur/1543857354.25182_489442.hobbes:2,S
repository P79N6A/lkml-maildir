It depends on your intent.  Generally speaking,
	while (i--) {
		...
	}
is never what you want.  Adding the check for being greater than 0 stops 
potential bugs from signed int i being negative.  The only drawback on x86 
is that it sets a byte based on the greater condition with setg and tests 
it later with testb for every iteration.  This use of testb will _always_ 
use the same addressable byte registers for both its operands.
Based on this particular patch, I agree that
	while (i-- > 0) {
		...
	}
will do the job.  This is equivalent to the original for loop and ensures 
that a negative value of i is never iterated on (even though it admittedly 
would never be negative in this instance to begin with).
