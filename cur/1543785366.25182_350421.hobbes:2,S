Like was mentioned, please use platform_device_register_simple()
instead, that's what it is there for.

Sure.

Load the version of the driver in 2.6.14-rc1.  Look in the /sys/
directory for where your driver shows up.  You should see a symlink
called "module" in there that points back to /sys/module/ for where your
module lives.  That symlink was created by the fact that you had set the
.owner field in the struct device_driver.
Taking that field away like you did removes that symlink, which is not a
good thing.
