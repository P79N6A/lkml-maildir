LKML is not the place for such questions.
Modules have to be loaded from a filesystem while built-in features are
available from the start.
The bootloader only loads the kernel image and optionally an initrd. The
initrd is used as a preliminary root filesystem which may contain kernel
modules to load to make the real root filesystem accessible. That's what
distributors do because they don't know in advance which drivers their
users will actually need. Endusers who build their own kernels might as
well compile all drivers that are needed for access to the root
filesystem into the kernel image and work without initrd.
