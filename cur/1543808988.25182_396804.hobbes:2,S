New filesystem is using BTrees for directories. An update will touch
multiple blocks, loaded into buffer_head structures with sb_bread.
If update fails (only possible causes are read error & disk full), is it
kosher to call bforget on all modified buffer_head structures, or
does that have some unintended consequences?
