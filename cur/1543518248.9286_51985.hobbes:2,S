This is unfortunately too complicated. There's an API which other kernel
modules use which would need to be updated as well and passing that
information to the completion routine as well.
It would needlessly clutter the API.
Someone has worked up a different solution that *may* work but I don't
know if it has any race conditions. We'll see.
I always have solution #2 which is not too complicated, but more
complicated that I'd like.
