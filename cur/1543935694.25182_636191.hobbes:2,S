That's what I thought. So what was Pavel talking about with "kill -9 no
longer works" and "suspend no longer works" above? I couldn't understand
it from the context.

I think they just gave up and considered it unsolvable. I'm not sure it is.

Couldn't some sort of scheduler based solution deal with the
uninterruptible sleeping case?

I can see the desirability of kexec when it comes to avoiding the
freezer, but comes with its own problems too - having the original
context usable is handy, not having to set aside a large amount of space
for a second kernel is also desirable and there are still greater issues
of transferring information backwards and forwards between the two kernels.
