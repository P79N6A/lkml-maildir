Huh?
Packet Engines used to sell FDRs -- "Full Duplex Repeaters", but (as the
name implies) FDRs were not collision based.  I don't know of any Gb
Ethernet collision-based repeaters.
Any collision-based operations will take place at 10 or 100Mbps.  Anyone
still using a repeater obviously doesn't need performance.

You might compare against my ns820.c driver.  (Note: It was initially
released before the ns83820.c driver was written, although the ns83820.c
driver was the one put into the kernel.)
