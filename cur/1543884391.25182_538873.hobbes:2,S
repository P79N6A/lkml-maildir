I can and do build my own kernels so that's not a problem for me.  I also have 
a firewire movie camera that went through absolute hell the last time a 
firewire upgrade came by, and it was over 5 months before I had a working 
kino install again.  So I'd vote unconditionally to have 2 trees to select 
from at module load time until the shakeout has produced usable code in the 
2nd tree.
From me, its a definite ACK.
