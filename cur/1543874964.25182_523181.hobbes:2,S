partitions on loop or device-mapper devices ?
you can use kpartx tool for this.
bryn m. reeves told me, that it's probably poissible to create udev rules 
that will automatically create partition maps when a new loop device is 
setup, which is better than adding partitioning logig into dm-loop for 
example.
example:
>kpartx -a /dev/mapper/loop0
>
># ls /dev/mapper/loop0*
>/dev/mapper/loop0  /dev/mapper/loop0p1  /dev/mapper/loop0p2
>/dev/mapper/loop0p3
i have seen a patch for loop.c doing this, though. search the archives for 
this

roland

Agreed.  What would be a right way?  Global device ala ptmx/tun/tap?
New syscall?  Something else?
