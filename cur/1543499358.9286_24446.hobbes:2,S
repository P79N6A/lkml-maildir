I have seen different messages when trying to recover. all data was lost
(converted to inode numbers in lost+found). Next time, I'll also try to save
the logs.

at least, I did not. I also have found that a few dir entries in the at that
time mounted msdos filesystems on the same disk was affected as well. It
contained invalid filenames that was not shown when 'DIR' was entered but
the subdirectory wasn't empty. Could not be cleared with del, or linux rm or
whatever.
I finally fixed it by editing the entries in the FAT.
anyways, 2.2.10 to date is still OK <knock on wood> but it does give me a
bad feeling.
