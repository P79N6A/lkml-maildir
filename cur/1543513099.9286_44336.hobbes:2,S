   My suggestion then would be to remove (EXPERIMENTAL) from HFS and let it
   stay for QNXfs. Comments, anyone?
that would be okay for 2.2.x. i need to track down a sendfile issue,
but it seems to be pretty solid. it wouldn't be okay for 2.3.x. i need
to integrate the page cache stuff and modularize things a bit for
hfsplus.
