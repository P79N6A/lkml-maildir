This is Radeon 7500 QW on a VT8363/8365 [KT133/KM133 AGP]
Cursor does not appear on console, fbset changes are most likely
to cause screen corruption or just black screen and what must effect all
fb graphics support, choosing an fbdriver and not fb console support, is
an accepted option (at least on menuconfig) having as a result blank
screen on boot.
However, comparing it to 2.4.x, console change between gettys is faster.
