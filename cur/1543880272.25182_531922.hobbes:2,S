I haven't played with union mounts with NFS. Hence would let Jan answer
this. However note that union mount provides a writable union only
if the filesystem supports the notion of whiteouts.

We we thinking something on similar lines as noted in our documentation.
Right now we maintain one inode for every whiteout. We were planning to
have a single whiteout inode and have all whiteout dentries point to this.
But here again we were thinking of having every filesystem support
this whiteout inode type.
Anyway I will have a look at ODF from unionfs to see how this is done.

I would assume that it should 'just work'. But right now it is not working.
Our code is not yet ready to correctly work with move mounts. Since pivot_root
has semantics similar to move mounts, pivot_root is also not working. Also
chroot to a union mount point is also not working atm. We will be working
to get all these right.
