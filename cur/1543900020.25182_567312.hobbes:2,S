OK, the way it works is that I send these patches at the git tree
maintainer, then the git tree maintainer merges them (this step is
unreliable) and then when I repull that git tree maintainer's tree I see
that they got merged so I drop them from -mm.  The git tree maintainer
decides when to send them to Linus.
I am presently pulling git://lost.foo-projects.org/~cleech/linux-2.6#master
into -mm.
Will you be taking over the IOAT git tree?  If so, please send me a
suitable git URL when it's ready.
The above tree has several changes in it from January (see
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.22-rc6/2.6.22-rc6-mm1/broken-out/git-ioat.patch
).
 Please take a look at those, work out what we should do with it all.
