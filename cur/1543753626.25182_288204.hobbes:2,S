I dont get how it is you dont have more platform_devices register than 
you should based on how serial8250_init works if you have additional 
code registering a serial8250 device.  For example, 
arch/arm/mach-s3c2410/mach-vr1000.c will register one serial8250 
device, and it appears to me that serial8250_init will register a 2nd.  
Is this the expected behavior or am I missing something?
