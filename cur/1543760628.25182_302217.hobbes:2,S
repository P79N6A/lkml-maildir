The AGP spec shows an example northbridge implementation that has the
AGP interface circuitry as a PCI-to-PCI bridge.  You don't have to do
it that way, but in any case you need some sort of PCI device to
represent the target (host) end of the AGP link.

Yes, exactly.

In the AGP 2.0 spec, the clearest statement I can find is in section
6.1.5, on page 248, where it says "Configuration registers are used by
the operating system to initialize A.G.P. features.  These features
must be supported by both A.G.P. master and target devices in the
following registers.", followed by a description of various PCI config
space registers.  In the context, "configuration registers" means
registers in the config space of a PCI device.  The AGP 3.0 spec is a
delta from the AGP 2.0 spec and doesn't revoke that requirement
anywhere that I could see.
Paul.
