Are there any known problems with via82cxxx_audio.c in 2.4.17?
Yesterday when I tried to record from my sound card, my machine
locked up completely. It did the same thing when I tried again
after reboot.
Today I was careful not to try and record from the soundcard. But
after playing a couple of samples, playback went silent. The following
message started appearing repeatedly in /var/log/messages:
kernel: Assertion failed! chan->is_active == sg_active(chan->iobase),via82cxxx_audio.c,via_chan_maybe_start,line=1198
At the moment I'm pretty much assuming I've got broken hardware, but
I'd be interested to know if there are any known problems with
the driver.
Thanks,
ABeet.
