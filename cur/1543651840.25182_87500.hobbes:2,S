Ah ok, yes on SCSI it's very easy to starve requests. There's no good
way to control this yet, unfortunately. Please set max number of tags to
2-4 or so, and you should not be able to kill the burn.
You wont see better performance with more tags than 4 anyways, and you
risk god awful latencies. So it's a good choice, regardless.
