Yes there is.  That's the whole reason the swap cache was added in the
first place.  It means that if we want to reuse the process's physical
memory again, we don't have to write it back to swap.

The kernel has _always_ done this, for good reason.  If you still go low
on swap, you have too little swap.

It will cause a page fault, yes, but not a COW: the do_wp_page will just
use the existing swap cache page if there are no other users of the page
(either in memory or in swap).  The page fault is there for a reason: it
tells us at which point the page's copy on disk is no longer valid.
