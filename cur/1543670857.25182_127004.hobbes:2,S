Well, then I would like to ask you to help me understand what
is so radically different (aside from the might-sleep), because
I simply don't get it, and I am always willing to learn ..

Yep, see my last message to Tom, I am doing that - however, it is
pretty difficult to grasp things at the first try [specially when
you are kind of in a rush for many different things :)].

Where did I say that? I am not talking about printk() anywhere, 
btw, although if someone wants to do that, hey, it's their decision, 
isn't it? I am nobody's Mum as to tell them what to do and not 
to do.
OTOH, if someone would consider plugging printk to kue, I'd
consider kind of stupid to printk recallable messages ... if it
can be recalled, why print it at all?
I don't know why, but I have a feeling like you are taking all
this conversation too personal. It is not my intention to stomp
over all your work and criticize it. I am learning what you guys
have done, and yes, looking for defects or problems, because I
am concerned about things that don't match in my head and how
to solve them.

Hey, where is your sense of humor?! Are you German, like my 
girlfriend? ;)
Automatically resizeable buffers are of *much* interest, to me at
least - remember that the only point I was stressing is I am leaving
that design/implementation issue out of the kue code, up to the 
client, while in relayfs it is inside of it.
I consider that a gain in kue's flexibility, while it is a gain 
in performance and space optimization on relayfs's hand (this is
my interpretation of Tom words in a previous mail and the code
I have had time to grasp; I think it makes full sense).

And I never said nowhere that it should not, in fact I have
stated clearly that printk's is something you shall not recall.
Twice, already ...
