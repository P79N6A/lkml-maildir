IIRC, about 2 or three years ago (or maybe on the 2.6.10 timeframe),
there was a patch which managed to pass the interactive from one app
to another when there was a pipe or udp connection between them. This
meant that a marked-as-interactive xterm would, when blocked waiting
for an Xserver response, transfer some of its interactiveness to the
Xserver, and aparently it worked very good for desktop workloads so,
maybe adapting it for this new scheduler would be good.
