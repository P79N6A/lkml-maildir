The smaller and more obvious the change is, the less critical the bug has 
to be.
If it's a really unlikely bug, and fixing it requires some fundamental 
changes, I consider the fix to be potentially more dangerous than the bug. 
But if the fix is re-ordering two lines in really obvious ways, and the 
bug itself is potentially nasty, the fix obviously goes in.
It's a matter of balancing the potential downside of a fix (which is 
unknown, but tends to be relative to how big the patch is) with the 
benefits (which should be known).

Yes, but at this point I actually want to be _more_ strict that just (c).
There are things that I bet Andrew will be willing to apply to -STABLE:  
things like architecture updates etc that clearly fix stuff. But right now
I want to avoid even that kind of noise: if it doesn't clearly help
_testing_ of stability, I'm just not interested at this point.
So for example, in the last week I just dropped some S390 updates without
even looking at them. It was too late - and even if they fix bugs, I don't
see that applying those patches simply would matter for 2.6.0 any more.  
So for example: I am pretty happy with how the size of the -test8 and 
-test9 patches have been shrinking, but even -test9 was big enough that I 
couldn't say that we're clearly "asymptotically approaching a stable 
kernel". At some point "noise patches" are bad if only because they make 
it less clear what the general status of the tree is.
In particular, if the 2.6.0-test10 patch is just 30kB compressed, and I
can just page through it with "less" and see that every single small part
of the patch was pretty clear and not something really scary, I'll be a
_lot_ happier about passing the thing off to Andrew. In contrast, if the
patch is full of stuff that isn't really obvious, I'm going to be less
happy, and worry more about what the side effects are.
