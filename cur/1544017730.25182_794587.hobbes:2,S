Avuton, Does your bios has an option which says limit the cpuid
vector limit to '2' or something. Can you disable that option and
re-check? It will typically be located under cpu configuration settings.
My system which has same stepping etc works just fine. But my bios doesn't
have the cpuid limit option. I need to check if this issue is because
of the cpuid limit option that is enabled in the bios.
thanks,
