Perhaps my proposal for a modification-sensing serial number could be
extended to work on all files as long as they're open?
Summary:
   - New files created in "Modified" state.
   - Reading serial number changes file to "Not-Modified".
   - Modifying file sets "Modified" state -- and if previous state
     was "Not-Modified", increments serial number once.
   - "Not-Modifed"->"Modified" transition propagates to parent
   - directory.
