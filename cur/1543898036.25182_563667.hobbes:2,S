Not really.
But, your argument is:
fE can only be used to create a different initial pE' than pP'.
If the binary doesn't know about capabilities, then you would never want
to do that since it won't change it's pE', and therefore it's pP' is
meaningless once pE' is set.
If the binary does know about capabilities, then it can change it's pE'
within the bounds of it's pP' whenever it wants, so we may want to set
pE' to 0 at start, but having pE' be just a subset of pP' has no
advantage since the binary can set pE' to the subset when it wants.
Now, *my* argument :) is that:
While there is no particular advantage (that I can think of) to having
the bitmap pE', there is also no disadvantage, and it produces kernel
code closer to the actual equations usually seen.
In the course of this discussion, the two advantages I've seen which
I'll concede to you are:
	1. the resulting equations may be easier to read/understand,
	   just bc it's one less bitmask operation whose purpose to try
	   to understand.  But I'm not certain.
	2. Improper setting of fE *could* in theory cause another
	   hard to diagnose sendmail-type vulnerability, by having fP
	   set to the right value, but fE to the wrong value.  Though
	   that is stretching things a bit.
The change in xattr format offsets those, which is why I like the idea of
just having the setfcaps program understand 'on=e' and 'off=e' (where on
is of course just an alias for 'all'), but keeping the kernel code the
same.
