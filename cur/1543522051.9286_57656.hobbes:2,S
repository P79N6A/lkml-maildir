Subject: Problems with kernel upgade (2.0.35 -> 2.2.13)

I've upgraded my kernel from 2.0.35 to 2.2.13 and was happy 'cause my
SCSI HDD will work on a speed 40 Mb/sec instead of 10 Mb/sec and free
memory will 128M insetad of 16M using old kernel but ...
I've get compiled kernel from www.slackware.com
System loaded successfully but appear several strange problems:
1. Route table was modified in a way that routing process for my
subnets doesn't work correctly  ... and I can't do "route delete
some_interface" from it - error appears. May be my route utility
(version 1.45) conflicts with this kernel?
2. Problems with printer connected to LPT. Print tasks appears
in a spool directory but printer doesn't print it. In lp.status (my
printer name is "lp") I see some kind of "lp is not connected or
off-line". By the way when my server restarts it doesn't re-initialize
printer
Thanks in advance
Any help welcome
