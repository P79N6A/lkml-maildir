Removing radeonfb from the kernel only makes things worse: the box
gets completly frozen when reproducing the bug (no more ssh access nor
sysrq).

I get these figures when I first start X:
[  104.399101] ### fb_location is now e0000000
[  104.399104] ### mem_size is 2000000
[  104.399107] ### aper_size is 4000000
[  104.399109] ### gart_vm_start is e2000000
The sad thing is that it looks like the crash occurs *before* entering
the radeon_do_init_cp function, assuming it should enter it again when
I switch back from a tty to X (I've put some printk's at the
beginning of the function but didn't see them in dmesg although other
things showed up), so I don't know where to put the printk's in order
to get other figures...
Thanks,
Jules
