One of the reasons why FAT is badly b0rken is the damn 'text mode'. I.e.
automagical translation of \r\n to \n and back. It is *wrong*. Not to
mention the fact that it screws up on binaries and relies on the list
of known extensions (barf) to do its magic. Or that renaming such files
changes their visible contents. Worse yet, open, rename, read, close,
open, read again and there you go - second read may return something
pretty different. IMO such thing has no place in the kernel...
