Hi,
I am using a Plextor SCSI CD-ROM drive on an AIC7890 (Asus P2B-DS),
kernel 2.2.2 with SMP. aic7xxx is built-in, sr/cdrom are modules.
When I try to mount a CD from /dev/sr0, but there is no disc in the
drive or the tray is open, the command will sleep uninterruptable -
the kernel message say 'bug: kernel timer added twice at c019c2fc'.
An open tray will close, because the cdrom driver believes the Plex
can handle tray_move's (and this seems to be right).
Saying 'options cdrom autoclose=0' in /etc/conf.modules helps.
Mounting and reading CD-ROM's in "normal" cases (CD inserted) works
fine, but users have reported problems with xcdroast - media change
(when trying to read multiple audio tracks from different CDDA's or
similar) make xcdroast hang (again, 'ps' shows 'D' as proc. state).
Kernel 2.1.109 with an pre-5.1.0 aic7xxx driver worked fine. It did
not close open trays, though.
Any other solution to this other than disabling autoclose?
If it is of interest, here is what else is in the system: Dual P-II
400MHz, 512MB RAM, 2xUW-SCSI HDD, 1xU2W HDD, 1xU-SCSI CD-ROM (Plex)
and 1xU-SCSI CD-W (Teac), PCI-Video (Permedia 2) and eth0 (3com).
Sorry if my question has been discussed here already, but I haven't
read this group for a while...
