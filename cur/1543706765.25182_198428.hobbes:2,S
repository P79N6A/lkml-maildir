I didn't claim it didn't help.  I objected to your claim that it would
"easily solve all problems".  It help, but isn't a cure-all.
(Sorry, I'm just touchy - after a quarter of a century of hearing "fixes
everything" claims for everything from "structured programming" to "extreme
programming", I tend to take extreme objection.. :)

4 tabs:
[/usr/src/linux-2.6.3-rc2-mm1]2 find . -name '*.[ch]' | xargs grep '\t\t\t\tgoto' | wc -l
    827
And 5:
[/usr/src/linux-2.6.3-rc2-mm1]2 find . -name '*.[ch]' | xargs grep '\t\t\t\t\tgoto' | wc -l
    183
Feel free to start fixing. :)
