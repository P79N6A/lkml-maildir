I think that the "dirty" FPU context must, at least, follow the new head. 
That's what the userspace sees, and you don't want an async_exec to 
re-emerge with a different FPU context.
I think it should also follow the async thread (old, going-to-sleep, 
thread), since a threadlet might have that dirtied, and as a consequence 
it'll want to find it back when it's re-scheduled.
So, IMO, if the USEDFPU bit is set, we need to sync the dirty  FPU context 
with an early unlazy_fpu(), *and* copy the sync'd FPU context to the new head.
This should really be a fork of the dirty FPU context IMO, and should only 
happen if the USEDFPU bit is set.
