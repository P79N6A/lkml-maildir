BTW, Linus - even if Linas did you already have commits with
broken author information; what you _can_ do is to have the
following entry in a .mailmap file in your linux-2.6.git
repository, where you run git-shortlog for your next
announcement:
        $ cat .mailmap
        Linas Vepstas <linas@austin.ibm.com>
        Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>
        ...
        $ 
Then the tool will pick up Author: line of the commit (which
is {'linas', '<linas@austin.ibm.com>'} pair) and figure out to
use the canonical "name" you define there instead of the broken
commit headers.  OK?

(This is also true in general - so any upstream maintainer who
ended up with commits that have badly formatted author
information in his repository that they'd rather have show up
nicer in the changelogs can do the same).
