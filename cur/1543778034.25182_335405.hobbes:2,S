That's not right.
Greg said he believed the right thing to do was to sync in the kernel,
but he also said he agreed with you. I thought at the time he was
confused about who was suggesting what - let's check with him.
Anyway, we discussed before that sync_sync before starting refrigerating
is insufficient. Remember that since processes aren't refrigerated yet,
there is absolutely nothing to stop other processes submitting I/O
between the two actions and thus making the sync pointless. The sync
needs to be done after the userspace processes that might submit I/O
have been frozen, to ensure that all the dirty data is actually synced
to disk.
Remember also that it is important that we do need to sync all dirty
buffers. In the case of not resuming, data loss should nil.
Regards,
Nigel
