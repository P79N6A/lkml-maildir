The only reason I can come up with is temporary files with preprocessing
output. Imagine the code:
	#define FOO 1
	FOO.
Here we have
a) replacement list of token FOO consists of one token -- 1,
b) pp-token list after preprocessing consists of 4 pp-tokens: newline, 1, .,
   newline
BUT, write it to temporary file:
	1.
Whoops, there are 3 or 4 pp-tokens? If you don't know history, there are
3, if you do, there are 4.
