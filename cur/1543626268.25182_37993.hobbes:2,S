Sure, I'll give 2.4.19pre5aa1 a go.  The patches didn't go in clean,
but the changes made since the split weren't too big to easily plug
them in.  (I only applied the patches which looked interesting for my
little UP box)
I was comparing the old 2.4 kernel to 2.5 because of a loss in write
throughput which I've been tracking for a while, and hoped to get back
via aa after reading some bits.

Mostly empty, but that doesn't matter much.. see below.

I don't mind if my box swaps a bit when stressed.  In fact, I like it
to go find bored pages and get them out of the way :)
It's the buffer.c changes (the ones I'm most interested in:) that are
causing my disk woes.  They look like they're in right, but are causing
bad (synchronous) IO behavior for some reason.  I have tomorrow yet to
figure it out.
