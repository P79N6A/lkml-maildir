With cap support directly in the FS, it won't work across NFS, or after a
cp, tar, cpio, what have you without modifying all these tools.  It also
won't work on any other fs without cap support. (of course)  This solution
has the nice property of working _now_, (well, pending code obviously) and
having great compatibility with current Linux code.

This is nicely backwards compatible, since under older kernels setuid 0
will merely raise _all_ caps, as opposed to operation under 2.2.X kernels
where it only raises _some_ caps, and can run as another user.  Besides,
_you_ can just de-select the 'Caps in ELF headers hack' option in the
kernel config.  Myself and others can use it to secure our systems...
_Please_ give this a little more thought, and give me _specific_ examples
of where this would cause breakage.  I wouldn't be arguing for this if it
wasn't an extremely useful feature with a lot of really excellent
properties...
