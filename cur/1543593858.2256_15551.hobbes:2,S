do I read this right: this is not a very critical bug?
In my case, it was 'top' which crashed twice (I was unable to reproduce
this while trying hard in the last 4 hours, after the original two cases). 
Are any processes which are not - like top or ps - trying to read
the /proc file system likely to be affected by the bug?
I am a bit worried about applying 'unauthorized' kernel paches to my
server. This has created problems for me in the past.
So, it the bug is non critical, I would rather accept the occasional
crash of 'top' or 'ps' than playing around with kernel code.
Please, comment.
