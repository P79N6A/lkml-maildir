For example harddrive wants to be in D0 during reboot. Now imagine
that BIOS can't handle soundcard in D0 during reboot (I believe some
such examples exists).... You only have D0, D1, D2, D3hot, D3cold; but
low-level driver really needs more info.
Now, you could have quirks at PCI layer saying "this device needs to
be D3 during reboot", but I believe thats ugly.
I believe right solution is to pass system state into suspend(), and
provide system_to_pci_state(), so that drivers that only care about
PCI state can use.
If you are right, every PCI driver will use system_to_pci_state.. but
I do not think that's the case. For example:
static void ide_device_shutdown(struct device *dev)
{
        ide_drive_t *drive = container_of(dev, ide_drive_t, gendev);
#ifdef  CONFIG_ALPHA
        /* On Alpha, halt(8) doesn't actually turn the machine off,
           it puts you into the sort of firmware monitor. Typically,
           it's used to boot another kernel image, so it's not much
           different from reboot(8). Therefore, we don't need to
           spin down the disk in this case, especially since Alpha
           firmware doesn't handle disks in standby mode properly.
           On the other hand, it's reasonably safe to turn the power
           off when the shutdown process reaches the firmware prompt,
           as the firmware initialization takes rather long time -
           at least 10 seconds, which should be sufficient for
           the disk to expire its write cache. */
        if (system_state != SYSTEM_POWER_OFF) {
#else
        if (system_state == SYSTEM_RESTART) {
#endif
...drivers are weird. Please provide them with full information.
