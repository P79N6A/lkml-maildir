If you could send me the exploit to run on 16Mbyte it would be very
confortable to me when I'll start looking into the problem again.

Try to increase inode-max to 8000 or 10000 just as workaround. It should
be not needed if I rember well, but I didn't looked the recovery part of
grow_inodes in detail and I am forced to stop playing with linux now. 
I'll return looking into inode.c this night...
