I've been running into a problem recently with lost time:  My system 
clock has been falling behind drastically -- earlier this week, with an 
uptime of less than 2 days, had lost 5100 seconds.
It seems to be tied to SCSI access:
# netdate tick; dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null bs=1kk count=100; netdate 
tick
tick +0.223              Sat Mar  6 19:59:08.000
100+0 records in
100+0 records out
tick -0.020              Sat Mar  6 20:00:28.000
# netdate tick; dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=1kk count=100; netdate 
tick
tick +0.365              Sat Mar  6 20:01:29.000
100+0 records in
100+0 records out
tick +52.664             Sat Mar  6 20:02:49.000
tick is a local Stratum-2 timeserver.
I can deal with the sub-second jitter between calls to netdate, but I 
can't deal with the loss of 52 seconds in an 80-second interval!  xntp3 
can't deal with it, either.
I don't think this is a user-space problem...
I dropped back to Linux 2.2.1 to see if it was a new problem in 2.2.2, 
but it doesn't seem to be.
My system:
  Linux 2.2.1  (Debian distribution, "potato")
  AMD K6-2 333
  FIC VA-503+ MB
  32MB PC100 SDRAM
  Adaptec 1520 SCSI controller
    /dev/sda: Seagate ST51080N
    /dev/scd0: SONY CD-ROM CDU-76S
Is there any other information that could help?
