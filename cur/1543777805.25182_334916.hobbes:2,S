It depends on what kind of PI under specific circumstances. In the general
kernel, it's really to be avoided at all costs since it's masking a general
contention problem at those places. In a formally provable worst case system
using priority ceiling emulation and stuff, PI really valuable. How a system
like the Linux kernel fits into that is a totally different story. General
purpose kernels using general purpose facilities don't.
That's how I see it.
