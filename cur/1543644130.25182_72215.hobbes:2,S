No problem.

Thanks for solving!  By the way, what does
                        set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
                        schedule();
actually do?  I guess it lets higher priority tasks have a go, while the
original yield() let equal priority tasks go first?  My knowledge of
sched_yield is out of date...

You are right.  I was confused because I thought I had observed
this problem once with ext2, but in fact I didn't test this case properly.
That's what you get for wanting to get some sleep at night...
Thanks again,
Duncan.
