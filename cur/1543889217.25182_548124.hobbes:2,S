I understand that the 'safe' decompression code is 'somewhat slower'  
and that decompressor performance is a key feature of this algorithm.  
However, I am concerned about the safety implications of including  
the 'unsafe' standard version in-kernel when likely uses include  
compression of network data, memory objects and so-on, all of which  
could in theory be maliciously modified.
I'm no kernel or programming expert, so I may be off the mark with  
this one. To me, at least, even if the answer is 'no, there isn't a  
problem' that's still a valuable clarification :)
Thanks,
