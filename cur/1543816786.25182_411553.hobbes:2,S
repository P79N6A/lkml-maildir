Your patch is part of what I had originally, but this was mildly objected to
because SE Linux didn't care, so I dropped the post function for later
resurrection.  See the email thread rooted on:

I'm happy with this patch, though I'd like the comment you can see in the
above snippet to be added back into key.c too.
Note also that by the time the post function is called, it's a little late to
be authorising creation of the key since the key has been published by that
point.
