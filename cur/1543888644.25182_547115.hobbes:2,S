Subject: man-pages-2.49 and man-pages-2.50 are released
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Gidday,
I just released man-pages-2.49 and man-pages-2.50.
These releases are now available for download at:
    
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
    or 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
    or mirrors: 
ftp://ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
and soon at:
    
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/manpages
Changes in 2.49 that may be of interest to readers of this list are listed
below (see the "changes" file for a complete list of changes).  The notable
change in 2.50 is the dropping of a number of man1 pages, as explained in
the "Changes" file:
        Once upon time Andries added a number of Section 1 manual pages
        to man-pages.  However, since that time, those pages have not
        seen much maintenance, and are not in fact distributed in most
        distributions.  Instead most distributions supply the
        coreutils versions of these pages, which are currently
        maintained.  In addition, man-pages provides the 1p pages,
        which document the portable subset of functionality of these
        commands.  Since the man1 pages are mostly unneeded, and
        out of date, I'm removing them.
(Exceptions are intro.1, ldd.1, and time.1, which will be retained.)
Cheers,
Michael

        Bug filed (
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8408

        to get this changed, but maybe that won't be done because it
        is an ABI change.
