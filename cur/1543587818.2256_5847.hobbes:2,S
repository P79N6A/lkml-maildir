Notice that with 2.4.3 it *only* affects the disk on the PCI controller card; a
similar ATA/100 disk on the motherboard's controller did not experience the
slowdown.
Also, FYI, I noticed the mention of VIA fixes in the -ac7 change list, but those
changes did not cause or fix this particular problem.  The problem occurs in all
the 2.4.3's that I've tried: -ac5, -ac6, -ac7.
BTW, It's not hurting me right now, because the disk on the PCI card hasn't been
put to work yet.  I just want to make sure you guys are aware of it.
