Subject: OOPS during NFS copy to/from 2.4.0-test5 machines.

I'm still playing with my new server.  I'm was trying to copy basicly everything
from my workstation over to the server by way of NFS when the machine I was
copying to oopsed.  This is the server I described in a earlier post (2
motherboards both talking to 1 RAID controller).  Save this time I was only
using one board, the other one was sitting idle (but still connected to the RAID
module).
I had to copy this oops by hand and decode it on a different machine because I
don't even have the new machine set up to the point where I could decode it.
The only other thing I noticed in the middle of the oops appeared this line:
Process kswapd (pid: 3, stackpage = f7eeb000)
I do hope to use this box as a server, and want to run 2.4.0 on it, so I'll do
everything I can to help you guys get this machine stable.
Oh perhaps I should list a little bit of the hardware in the machine:
Motherboard: Tyan S1867 Thunder 2500
Chipset:     ServerWorks ServerSet III HE
             SMC 37B787 Super I/O
CPUs:        Intel Pentium III EB 667 x2
RAM:         256MB Micron PC133 ECC Registered DIMMs x4
SCSI:        Dual Channel Ultra2 LSI Symbios SYM53C896
Ethernet:    Intel 82559
Audio:       Creative Labs PCI ES1373 AC'97 CODEC
IDE:         2 channels EIDE UltraDMA
Video:       Nvidia TNT2 Vanta 8MB AGP
And now the oops:

     -K (specified)
