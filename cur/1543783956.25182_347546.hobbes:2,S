That only answers about four of the questions. The rest only come out if
create_lockspace behaves like a file system - in other words
create_lockspace is better known as either mkdir or mount.
Its certainly viable to make the lock/unlock functions taken a fd, it's
just not clear why the current lock/unlock functions we have won't do
the job. Being able to extend the functionality to leases later on may
be very powerful indeed and will fit the existing API
