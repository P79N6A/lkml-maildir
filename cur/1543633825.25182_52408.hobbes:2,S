Sorry to bother you again Donald, but I'm still having problems,
The following error comes up when I make modules with the 1.06 version:
sundance.c: In function `sundance_probe1':
sundance.c:464: `pci_tbl' undeclared (first use in this function)
sundance.c:464: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
sundance.c:464: for each function it appears in.)
sundance.c: In function `cleanup_module':
sundance.c:1372: `pci_tbl' undeclared (first use in this function)
make[2]: *** [sundance.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/drivers/net'
make[1]: *** [_modsubdir_net] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/drivers'
make: *** [_mod_drivers] Error 2
I've checked the code of sundance.c, pci-scan.h and kern_compat.c and
pci_tbl isn't defined or declared anywhere in these files, am I missing
something else, or going crazy?
Thanks in advance,
Matthew Hall
