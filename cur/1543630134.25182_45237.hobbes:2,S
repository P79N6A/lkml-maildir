If that were only true.  The problem is that some architectures can be
built with either endian.  Mips, for example, seems to take the endian
stuff in as an environment variable.  The linker seems to know this
stuff, but does not provide the "built in" to allow it to be used.
The info is available from the header files at compile time, but I could
not find a clean way to export it to the Makefile, where we might choose
which linker script to use.  I suppose we could run the linker script
thru cpp if all else fails.  Any ideas?
