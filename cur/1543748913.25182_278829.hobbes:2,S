Why must the server be non-preemptable?  Have you written code for a
server that can immediately switch to another clients request? I've
tried, and it's not easy.  The work of the server would only process one
client at a time. In that regard, the server is "non-preemptable", but
in services to be done, not in context switching. B would preempt server
S just because B is a higher priority. But when B puts itself to sleep
on S's wait queue, S would then inherit B's priority. But S would still
be finishing A's work. When S finished A's work, it would go directly on
to B's work.  This is just like a mutex. Think of the code within a
mutex as a service, and the Server is just the thread that happens to be
doing the work. So Process A would go into the mutex, become Sa, then
when B wanted to go into the mutex, Sa would inherit B's priority, and
when it's finish with A's work, it would become Sb.

Server S would not know that B is on the wait queue, except that B has
increased S's priority. S would still work on A's request, so the only
saving for S would be in the S's stack when B preempted it.

How would you redirect the Server?  If server S is working on A's work,
(let's make it easy and use the example of a web server) A sends S a
request to serve page P, S goes to retrieve P, then B comes along and
request page Q, how would you write the code to know to stop working on
getting P and start getting Q, S is a single thread, doing the work, not
multiple instances.

If you have a single thread working as the server, how do you go about
writing code that can have that thread stop a task in the middle and
start doing something else. Although there may not be a need to do
certain things non-preemptively, but a server (should I say server
thread), only does one task at a time, giving it a same functionality as
a mutex.

I agree with you here, since a process can only have one server working
on it at a time. But this can become a problem, if you have one server
working for another server. If server S needs something from server X
then X needs something from server S, and they both are waiting. But
that would already have shown up in the kernel.
The whole point I'm trying to make is that today, when a high priority
process goes onto a wait queue, the process that will server that rt
process may be of a lower priority than other processes lower that the
original rt process that is waiting.  So you have a case of priority
inversion within processes serving other processes.
