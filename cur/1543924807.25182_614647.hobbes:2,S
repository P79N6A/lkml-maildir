My hat is off to David Howells.  He's willing to carry out far-ranging 
changes well beyond the point I can stomach.

It's for system suspend.  All the devices are locked to prevent driver 
binding and unbinding during the suspend transition.
Even apart from that, there are places where the USB core needs to
acquire multiple layers of locks (more than just two).  For example, if
somebody has hubs nested several deep and then unplugs the hub closest
to the computer, this will happen.
Shucks, any time a driver's probe routine tries to register a child 
device you will run into problems.  probe() is always called with the 
device locked, and registration of a child will acquire the child's 
lock in order to probe drivers for the child.

I don't follow your reasoning.  Let's say a task wants to lock all the
direct children of a particular device.  In what order should the locks
be acquired?  There's no natural tree-related ordering to follow.
In the simple case where locks are acquired along a path in the tree,
you could solve the lockdep issues by passing mutex_lock_nested() a key
equal to the device's depth in the tree.  But that won't work with more
complicated cases.

Of course.  So what?  In many cases the code needs to keep all three
locks.  The locks don't merely guarantee the device structs' continued
existence (a kref could do that) -- they serialize a number of related
operations.

Yep.  But this isn't a typical tree-locking.  System suspend sometimes
requires that devices be powered down in a specific order, and there
are constraints not captured by the positions in the tree.  We get
around this by powering devices down in reverse order of detection,
which should always be safe.  Although the locking need not necessarily
follow these same constraints, it is certainly the easiest approach.
(And by the way, your example rule "lock old parent, lock child, lock
new parent" is subject to deadlocks.  What if another task tries to
move a different device from under the new parent to the old parent at
the same time?)

I don't understand what you mean by "lock-coupling".
