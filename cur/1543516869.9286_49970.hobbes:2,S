Correct.  The optimization will work just fine, and it increases
performance significantly.  After the LOCK# lead gets pulled, you will
see tons of non-cacheable memory references on an analyzer as the
processor re-fills the pipelines and internal write buffers.  It's
heavier than a TLB flush.  My observations indicated that the PPro would
loose 24+ clock cycles (and depending on the Memory Bus Controler
chipset on your motherboard, even more) of time to recover after a LOCK#
assertion.    
NetWare 4/5 uses this optimization in it's spinlocks.  It works fine and
boosts performance.  On Intel machines, LOCK#'s are heavier than they
need to be becuase of all the issues Intel has with people writing
self-modifying code (about 60% of their errata deals with this problem).
