	For 600 parallel connectons with 1,200 wakeup events per second over 600
handles, poll versus select versus signals is irrelevant. Neither of them
will be anywhere near 10% of available computing resources on a P2-450.
	I care about 16,000 parallel connections on a switched 100-base-T network.
I care about 'one-to-many' broadcast applications where you receive a stream
from one source and have to propogate that data to 15,000 clients as quickly
as possible. Consider a server propogating streaming audio over the Internet
using TCP connections.
	Why optimize for the cases where you aren't under load?
