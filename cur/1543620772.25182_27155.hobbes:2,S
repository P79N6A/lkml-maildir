HI,
I am using 2.4.9-13 kernel. I want to use large socket buffers .I set 
maximum values for /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max and 
/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max and also made sure the maximum value is high for 
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem and /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem. But when i run 
some ttcp tests i observe that the advertised window of the receiver starts 
from 5792 bytes even though i use large windows.I read that 2.4 kernels do 
auto-tuning. Is there anyway i can make the advertised windows larger than 
5792 . OR please suggest some resources where i can find the information 
about the socket buffer implementations. I need this information very much
Awaiting a reply from some of you.
Thanks
Mahesh
