Hi,
it appears that bad filters in net/core/filter.c can read/write arbitrary
kernel memory.
Given a filter created via:
        struct sock_filter s[2];
        memset(s, 0, sizeof s);
        s[0].code = BPF_LD|BPF_B|BPF_ABS;
        s[0].k    = 0x7fffffffUL;
        s[1].code = BPF_RET;
        s[1].k    = 0xfffffff0UL;
or:
        s[0].code = BPF_LD|BPF_B|BPF_IND;
        s[0].k    = 0x7fffffffUL;
        s[1].code = BPF_RET;
        s[1].k    = 0xfffffff0UL;
or
        s[0].code = BPF_LD|BPF_H|BPF_IND;
        s[0].k    = 0x7ffffffeUL;
        s[1].code = BPF_B|BPF_RET;
        s[1].k    = 0xfffffff0UL;
or
        s[0].code = BPF_LD|BPF_H|BPF_IND;
        s[0].k = 0x7ffffffeUL;
        s[1].code = BPF_B|BPF_RET;
        s[1].k = 0xfffffff0UL;
These pass check filter calls:
	sk_chk_filter(s, 2)
But then blow up severely after calling:
static inline void *skb_header_pointer(const struct sk_buff *skb, int offset,
                                       int len, void *buffer)
{
        int hlen = skb_headlen(skb);
which increments the data pointer:
        if (offset + len <= hlen)
                return skb->data + offset;
but does not check if (offset+len) could overflow.  
Something gross along the lines of:
        if((offset + len) < offset) {
                printf("ERROR: hit overflow!\n");
                return NULL;
        }
seems to fix the problem, but most likely filter.c should do it.
If anyone could confirm or refute these I'd appreciate it.  [We've been
developing a tool to automatically generate test cases by running code
partially symbolically and these were some of first errors it flagged.]
