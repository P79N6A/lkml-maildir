It's a new interface I only recently wrote:
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/x86_64/quilt/patches/early-reserve
Then you can use early_reserve() and the e820 allocator will not touch
it.

It has a little of a chicken'n'egg problem because the e820 map will
be actually in the area you want to reserve. But it might work too.
Boot data is normally copied before other allocations in head64.c
If you do variable size boot data that might not work though.  And might
be a little fragile overall.
