Subject: [patch] x86_64, vsyscall: fix the oops crash with __pa_vsymbol()

Appended patch fixes an oops while changing the vsyscall sysctl.
I am sure no one tested this code before integrating into mainline :(
BTW, using ioremap() in vsyscall_sysctl_change() to get the virtual
address of a kernel symbol sounds like an over kill.. I wonder if we
can define a simple __va_vsymbol() which will return directly the
kernel direct mapping. comments in the code which says gcc has trouble
with __va(__pa()) sounds bogus to me. __pa() on a vsyscall address will
not work anyhow :(
And also, the whole nop out syscall in vsyscall page infrastructure
(vsyscall_sysctl_change()) is added to make some attacks difficult,
and yet I don't see this nop out being done by default. This area
requires more cleanups?
thanks,
suresh

Fix an oops with __pa_vsymbol(). VSYSCALL_FIRST_PAGE is a fixmap index.
We want the starting virtual address of the vsyscall page and not the index.
