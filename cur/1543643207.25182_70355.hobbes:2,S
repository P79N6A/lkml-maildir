Not quite. But it's expensive. It adds 4 bytes per task, plus a second 
OOM killer.

Rather whom would you ask?

That's bad, it could get killed. ;-)
Mostly the mem eaters are those who hang in an malloc() deadloop.
	char *x = NULL;
	/*
	 * We need this variable, so if we don't get it, we reallocate it 
	 * regardless of what happened.
	 */
	do {
		x = malloc(X_SIZE);
	} while (!x);
That's possibly a candidate.
So if we just count how often per second that stubborn process uses 
malloc(), you'll catch the right guy most of the time. If you don't get 
a process that's over the threshold, do usual OOM killing...
