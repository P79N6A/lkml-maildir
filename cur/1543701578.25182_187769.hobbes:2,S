While you're at it, see what *else* you can turn off - RAID, devfs, NFS, etc.
It's equally likely that you're tripping over some other kernel module's
use-after-free or chase-the-wrong-pointer bug.  I've seen a lot more bugfixes
for *those* on this list than cases where "I turned off nvidia and it started
working".
From the 2.6.1-rc1 release notes:
Jeff Garzik:
  o [libata] fix use-after-free
Stephen Hemminger:
  o [ROSE]: Fix use after free in socket destruction

That's *this week* or so. Yes, I understand the political and/or realistic
reasons for refusing to look at tainted kernels, but let's face it guys, *our*
code is to blame more often than NVidia's.  When was the last time there was a
*verified* report of "I turned the NVidia graphics module off and things
worked" that wasn't directly related to a graphics issue?
