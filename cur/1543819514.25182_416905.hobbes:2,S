It contains AHCI, right? Then try 
http://www.spinnaker.de/linux/c1320/sata-resume-2.6.16.5.patch
For some others like ata_piix ,,SATA ACPI objects support'' patch by Randy 
Dunlap is needed AFAIK. See 
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/SATA
 for old 
versions of these. It seems that nothing happened in this area in last 2 
months. It no longer applies (parts of it are already in mailine, other parts 
changed too much). Z60* ThinkPads probably need that patch.
