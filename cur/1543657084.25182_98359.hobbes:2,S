I would agree, but there is a special restriction on offsetof() and 
sizeof() of structures with flexible array members: section 6.7.2.1, 
clause 16:
First, the size of the structure shall be equal to the offset of the last element of an otherwise identical structure that replaces the flexible array member with an array of unspecified length.
The simplest test case I've found is
struct a1 { int a; char b; short c[];};
struct a2 { int a; char b; short c[1];};
    sizeof(struct a{1,2}) is 8.
    offsetof(struct a{1,2}, c) is 6.
--> sizeof(struct a1) != offsetof(struct a2, c)

I agree. Should we fix the kmalloc allocations, too?
-	pp = kmalloc(sizeof(struct poll_list)+
+	pp = kmalloc(offsetof(struct poll_list,entries)+
			sizeof(struct pollfd)*
			(i>POLLFD_PER_PAGE?POLLFD_PER_PAGE:i),
				GFP_KERNEL);
