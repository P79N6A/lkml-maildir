It's me again, since my old patch started failing in net/netsyms.c.
So anyway, this patch will cleanly update your Wireless Extension
to version 16, diffed against the vanilla 2.5.66 kernel.
You can retrieve it at:
http://triplehelix.org/~joshk/linux/we15_2.5.66-we16.patch.bz2
It is best used with wireless-tools 26-pre7, to take advantage of
what WE16 actually does different from v15 which is already in the
kernel.
This is obviously still in testing, since Jean hasn't had it merged
with the main tree. Use at your own risk. :)

Josh
