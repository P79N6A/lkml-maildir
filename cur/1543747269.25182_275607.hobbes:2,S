Hi guys,
Sorry for my English...
I would like to ask you, if you know something about the RTL8180 based WiFi 
cards (for example D-Link DWL-510   [802.11b]) support i Linux kernel.
Are there some patches? Are you plaining to add this support?
Can you please tell me, who may I ask.
I saw some drivers on sourceforge (rtl-ppd/rtl-8180) and on realtek driver 
page. The first project didn't released any files yet, the second won't 
compile on my kernel-2.6.8.1 and the third are binary drivers for 2.4.x 
kernel.
Now, I'm supposed to use NDISWRAPPER, which is pretty ugly (using drivers for 
one unmentioned OS)
I'm not a programmer.
Please help me.
Thank you. 
	Marex
