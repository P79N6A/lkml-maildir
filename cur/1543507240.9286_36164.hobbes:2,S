I bought a new harddisk today and now
mke2fs -c -m0 /dev/hdb2 gives me this output:

Checking for bad blocks (read-only test): done
Block 49 in primary superblock/group descriptor area bad.
Blocks 1 through 62 must be good in order to build a filesystem.
Aborting....

But dmesg does not give me any kernel-messages which could tell me that
there is something wrong with the harddisk or the partion.
Is this a bug in the checkblocks part of mke2fs? Or does the check test
for errors that are not logged in the kernel?
Shall I believe dmesg (no error messages) or shall I believe the check
option of mke2fs and ask my dealer for a replacement?
Is this message a problem for mke2fs? Or can I use this partition
without any risk?
Greetings, Michael.
