Subject: [PATCH 0/8] base-small: CONFIG_BASE_SMALL for small systems
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch series introduced a new pair of CONFIG_EMBEDDED options call
CONFIG_BASE_FULL/CONFIG_BASE_SMALL. Disabling CONFIG_BASE_FULL sets
the boolean CONFIG_BASE_SMALL to 1 and it is used to shrink a number
of core data structures. The space savings for the current batch is
around 14k.
