I appreciate Matheus's help, but installing a stock
kernel on a production server and waiting a few days
to see if the bug shows up is problematic for me.
I've already reviewed Fedora-specific changes in this
kernel and none of them appears to be related to my
problem.  The only patch that comes close is:
  linux-2.6.11-libata-promise-pata-on-sata.patch

Thanks for the suggestion.  I think I'll leave it enabled
on the server.  I've just compiled the netconsole module,
but it depends on the non-modular netpoll, so I'll have to
wait until next reboot in order to try it out.
By the way, the documentation doesn't say how to interface
with syslogd.  Is it sufficient to use port 514 and turning
on the -r option?
