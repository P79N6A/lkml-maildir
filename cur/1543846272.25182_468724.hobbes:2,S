Many of us work in environments where initialization is in the coding
standard. It also helps with static analysis tools. CodingStyle seems to
be silent on the point, but points to Kernighan and Ritchie, who say
"These initializations are actually unnecessary, since all are zero, but
it's a good idea to make them explicit anyway."
Any reasonable compiler will avoid doing the initialization twice...

| int rc is unnecessary because the function always returns 0. This

Wonder if he wrote it for a coding standard that requires single return
(so that the "return -EIO" would have been "rc=-EIO") and converted
it...
