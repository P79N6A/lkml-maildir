Not to me, no.  But I was wrong before.
Having no console at all is a valid design.  It used to cause
problems, my patch fixes them.  A command-line option like
"console=/dev/null" doesn't fix it because it doesn't do what it
appears to do at first glance, so the patch is needed.
Having a non-working console, esp. for debug, is a rather odd design.
My approach would be to either explicitly tell the kernel to use the
other as default console via "console=/dev/ttyS0" or not have the
debug thing in the kernel in the first place.  Either way, no patch is
needed.
Worse, a kernel patch would paper over what is an underlying problem
in my book.  Fix the first problem, don't live with it as good as
possible.
Is this reasonable?
