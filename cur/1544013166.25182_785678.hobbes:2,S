Is there any reason why CONFIG_PROCESSOR_SELECT is limited to EMBEDDED only?
In my desktop pc is one specific cpu only, so I do not need support for the
other processors. Unfortunately, I have no chance to disable the other ones.
As it is already configurable, why not giving this option to everyone?
