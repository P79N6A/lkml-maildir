...but if you drop the spinlock across the call to
tty_flip_buffer_push, you get an Oops?
Could you post the Oops?

Which question did you answer "yes" to? That it's worse than before or
that the interrupt handler runs in hardirq context (i.e. IRQF_NODELAY)?

No, I'd expect your allocation fix to take care of that. Or did you by
any chance test without the fix and with slub_debug enabled?

I have no idea. Could you post some more specifics about what you
modified, for example a diff?
Most of the tasklet is already protected by the spinlock, so you must
be careful to avoid any lock recursion.
