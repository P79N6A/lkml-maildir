Yes. Since an array element position is essentially 
base_ptr + sizeof(each_element) * index, if sizeof(each_element) is not a 
multiple of the cache line, the next element will start in the middle of a 
cache line.

Yes. If CPU 2 tries to write to struct member 1 of array element 2, and 
array element 1 is in CPU 1's cache, it must be invalidated.
GCC (and kernel macros) provide good support for enforced cacheline 
alignment, but it's also possible to pad your structures.
