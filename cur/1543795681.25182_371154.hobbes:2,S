Yes. Also, for both type of notifiers we use semaphore to protect the
list, so we cannot call unregister from atomic context.

That is a good idea, we can do that.

After discussions in lkml (and looking at usages of notifier chains in
code), the consensus was that we needed two types of notifier chains,
atomic and blocking.
During the discussions we concluded that blocking notifiers can be
easily protected with a semaphore. Locks is not good enough for atomic
notifiers as they are called from NMI context too. So, we needed a
lockless way to protect the list traversal, hence RCU.

Will do.

The problem is that the current notifier chain mechanism gives the
notion of protection (lock acquired in register/unregister), but does
not protect list traversal.

We can just remove the write_lock from register/unregister of current
implementation and it will do what you are suggesting. 
Also, with the current implementation, subsystems can assume that there
is no locks, but none of them do. They work around the locking/race
issues different ways like (1) not unregistering at all (most of them)
or having (2) their own _complete_ notify chain logic (usb).
(1) is a workaround and (2) is redundant code.
