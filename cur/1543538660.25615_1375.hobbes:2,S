I am having problems compiling kernel 2.4.0-test3.
It occurs only if I remove SMP support from kernel config. 
The diff from test2/include/linux/sched.h and test3/include/linux/sched.h
is that : 
/usr/src/linux-2.4.0-test2/include/linux# diff sched.h
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/sched.h |grep PRIO
< #define DEF_PRIORITY  (20*HZ/100)     /* 200 ms time slices */
<     counter:          DEF_PRIORITY,                                   \
<     priority:         DEF_PRIORITY,                                   \
DEF_PRIORITY is not Defined in test3 tree, and kernel/timer.c needs it.
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -pipe   -march=i686 -fno-strict-aliasing   -c -o
timer.o timer.c
timer.c: In function `update_process_times':
timer.c:580: structure has no member named `priority'
timer.c:580: `DEF_PRIORITY' undeclared (first use in this function)
timer.c:580: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
timer.c:580: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [timer.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/hd2/src/linux-2.4.0-test3/kernel'
make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/hd2/src/linux-2.4.0-test3/kernel'
