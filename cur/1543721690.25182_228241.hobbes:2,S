the right thing = compatible with your drivers.

who says all the modifications suse does to their kernel is on the bad
side? im sure they some kind of reason to change the kernel code.
true, its not exactly the same as the vanilla kernel.
and true, it would be best if they could make do compatible code,
however, and as you are supposed to be a developer, you must know that
it is not possible to always keep compatibility.
and as earlier mentioned, "it has 11mb differences."
oh well well, the unzipped suse diff from you, is 13mb, but that doesent
really matter, however, what matters is all the overhead diff creates.
if you open the diff you can see that it will probably only be half the
differences the suse kernel really has, like 6.5mb or something near it.
i dont want to say theres no possibility that there really is a kernel
bug. but saying "madness" is abit harsh to do.
