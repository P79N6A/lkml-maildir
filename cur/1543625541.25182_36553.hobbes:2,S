Subject: linux-2.5.7 BUG() calls in slab.c

	Under 2.5.7, running fsck on a 40GB disk partition (with
perhaps 10GB in use) would reliably create a kernel BUG() call
from slab.c at either line 1463 or line 1467, apparently due to
a call to shrink_icache_memory (a few levels up the call stack).
The disk drive is IDE.
	Because this particular partition was a scratch area,
I was able to work around the problem by doing an mkfs on the
offending partition.
