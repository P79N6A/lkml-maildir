Jeff,
I resubmit the patch supporting the latest Chelsio T3 adapter.
It incorporates Arjan's feedbacks:
- remove unnecessary ifdefs
- updates the pci ressource managment
- add flush after register write.
It is built against Linus'tree.
A corresponding monolithic patch is available at this URL:
http://service.chelsio.com/kernel.org/cxgb3.patch.bz2
This driver is required by the Chelsio T3 RDMA driver
which was updated on 12/20/2006.
Cheers,
Divy
