Umm. Why? Think about it.
You ASKED it to stop forwarding memory.
So who is lamer: the chip that does what it is told, or the software that 
tells it to do it?
I'd vote for the software. Any programmer who expects the hardware to 
"just do what I mean, not what I say" is not a programmer, but a dreamer. 
You told it to not forward memory. Why complain when it does as told?

Ehh. Even for PCIe, why not use the normal accesses for the first 256 
bytes? Problem solved.
