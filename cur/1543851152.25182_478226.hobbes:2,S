What should work (with the USB_NET_MCS7830 part from Randy's patch 
removed) together with your patch and the
  #if defined(CONFIG_MII) || (defined(CONFIG_MII_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
is:
config USB_USBNET
        tristate "Multi-purpose USB Networking Framework"
        select MII if USB_NET_AX8817X!=n || USB_NET_MCS7830!=n
