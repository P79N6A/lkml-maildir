Hello,
I've seen a similar problem on linux-2.2.13pre6 (Intel system, 3c590 NIC).
Here somtimes active ftp transfers starve and it is not possible to build new ftp-data 
connections until the system is rebooted, but everythinge else (telnet, samba, www)
works fine. netstat -t -a shows ftp-data sockets in CLOSE state with data in the 
send-queue.
Attached is a tcpdump from several unsuccessful uploads and downloads to this server.
Interesting is, that it takes at least three SYN, SYN-ACK steps before a connection is
established.
Maybe I'm wrong, but It looks like somehow the socket hashes got corrupted and packets
end up in wrong sockets (maybe some CLOSED socket remained hashed? tcp_v4_lookup
assumes this could not happen)
