I just saw, and fixed, a very similar problem last night (lost interrupts,
but partition table was eventually read).  The system was a dual Xeon on a
P4DP6.  The Promise card was an Ultra100TX2.  The OS was RedHat 7.3.
The fix was to increase the bus master time for the PCI slot in the BIOS.
This was also tried under SuSE 8.1, where it did NOT work.
YMMV.
