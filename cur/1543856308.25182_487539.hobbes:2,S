Congestion control is always appropriate in a shared network.  Please
note that congestion control does not conflict with the objectives of
UDP.  For UDP, congestion control can simply mean dropping packets at
the source.  DCCP is a good replacement for UDP that has congestion
control.
In general it's much better to much better to drop packets at the
source rather than half-way through.
