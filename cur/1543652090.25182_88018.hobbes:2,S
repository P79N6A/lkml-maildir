Subject: installing modules to ($PREFIX)/lib/modules/2.....

  I need to move the modules from a new kernel compile from my compile
machine to a production test.  Previously this has been done with some
rsync and diff magic.  The problem is the potential to kill the compile
server if a module is overwritten that is needed.
  I've compiled my kernel and modules but want to install the modules to
/tmp/lib/modules/2.4.18 so I can tar that up and move it to the server
in question.  Is there a system for doing this built into the kernel
compile structure I haven't found yet?
