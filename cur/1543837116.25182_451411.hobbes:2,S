I'm getting the following in 2.6.18-rc3-mm2 when I complile AFS  and NFS
into the kernel.  I left FSCACHE as a module somehow, enabled AFS/NFS
caching, and hilarity ensues:
fs/built-in.o(.text+0xbbcd7): In function `nfs_fscache_release_page':
lxc/include/linux/fscache.h:482: undefined reference to
`__fscache_uncache_page'
Is there some way that we can tell fscache's Kconfig option that it can
not be a module if any of the filesystems using it *are*?  Should we
take away the option for fscache to be a module?
