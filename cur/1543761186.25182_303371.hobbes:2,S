This is more than likely caused by the multi-bridge AGP stuff in -bk3
.. if you could test 2.6.11-bk2 and then -bk3 and see if it breaks
there.. if not there can you test the -bk6 -bk7 transition...
these are the only two points where DRM stuff was merged in .. I'm in
no position to test for about a week so unless someone else gets to it
first it'll be at least that long..
Dave.
