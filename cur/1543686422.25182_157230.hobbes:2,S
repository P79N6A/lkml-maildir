Hi, AMD has not confirmed anything with respect to this issue
on K7/Athlon. We are currently trying to get the code that reproduces
this bug into AMD so we can see what triggers it.
Andi's workaround for Opteron (before a BIOS fix was available),
is probably a fine *short-term* workaround until we can get back 
to you on this. AMD believes that dimissing a exception on
prefetch as spurious on Athlon will work you around the current
problem.
Linking the Opteron bug to an Athlon bug is pre-mature at this point.

Let us get back to you, ok? I am starting up our
internal validation people to go poke at this.
