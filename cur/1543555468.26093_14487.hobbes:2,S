The "other" list in LINK_FIRST is sorted by name.  It could be changed
to a random sort, probably based on a hash of size and mtime.  It would
be relatively expensive so would have to be restricted to a "exercise
the kernel" CONFIG option.

There is no need for multiple LINK_n entries, the objects partition
neatly into three groups.  LINK_FIRST objects, in the order they are
defined.  The rest of the objects (object list - (LINK_FIRST +
LINK_LAST), in an undefined order.  LINK_LAST objects, in the order
they are defined.
If you can come up with a concrete link order example that cannot be
handled by a three partition model then I will listen.  Otherwise it is
just over engineering.
