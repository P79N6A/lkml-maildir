I have a client machine that I can't get 2.4 to boot on.  It is an SMP 
motherboard with one CPU  , dual port aic7896/97 ultra2 onboard.
I'm slowing going backwards from 2.4.6-pre5 and am currently compiling 
2.4.3.  With the later kernels, the machine simply hangs, flat out does 
nothing instead of initializing the aic driver.  With the earlier 
kernels I get the below messages.  BTW, why the heck is the linux kernel 
relying on Berkely DB?  I find it rather bothersome that I have to go 
fetch and compile a userland library just to compile the aic driver.
More details to follow I'm sure.
