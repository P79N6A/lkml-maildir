Subject: [PATCH 0/2] cgroup map files: Add a key/value map file type to cgroups

[ Updated from the previous version to remove the colon from the map output ]
These patches add a new cgroup control file output type - a map from
strings to u64 values - and make use of it for the memory controller
"stat" file.
It is intended for use when the subsystem wants to return a collection
of values that are related in some way, for which a separate control
file for each value would make the reporting unwieldy.
The advantages of this are:
- more standardized output from control files that report
similarly-structured data that needs to be parsed programmatically
- less boilerplate required in cgroup subsystems
- simplifies transition to a future efficient cgroups binary API
