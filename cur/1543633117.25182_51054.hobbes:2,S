   If you're talking per-socket SNMP counters, then that could work.
   General protocol-wide counters would not help much, at least
   in my case.
Why not?  If you know where the drops are occurring, what else
do you need to know?
I'm not talking about per-socket SNMP counters, that would be
rediclious.
