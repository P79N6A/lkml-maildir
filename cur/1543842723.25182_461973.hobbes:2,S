But this is not how it behaves today, right? I do not think you could
push 'break-make-as-root' as a bugfix to -stable ;-).

Would per-system default capability masks be enough? ... .... okay,
probably not, because nosuid is per-mount, and this is similar.

Can we simply split them at kernel interface layer? Libc could do it,
preventing confusion...

Agreed.
