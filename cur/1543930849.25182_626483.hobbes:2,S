IMHO, it looks much better this way.
I had an idea of having a set of defined 'load balancing' points in
sched.c. Then every sched_class would provide smth like struct
load_balance_ops; that contains a number of callbacks (one per load
balancing point) or just one generic load_balance() method with an
additional argument to distinguish between different 'points'. Then we
could have smth like :
generic_load_balance(event, rq, task)
{
      for_each_sched_class (class) {
              if (!class->load_balance)
                       continue;
              if (class->load_balance(event, rq, task))
                       break; /* success, don't propagate any further */
      }
}
[ i.e., the same way we do it in pick_next_task() ]
then e.g. the following block in schedule()
---
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
       if (prev->sched_class->pre_schedule)
              prev->sched_class->pre_schedule(rq, prev);
#endif
if (unlikely(!rq->nr_running))
          idle_balance(cpu, rq);
---
would be substituted by:
generic_load_balance(PRE_SCHEDULE, rq, prev);
i.e., the following block
>         if (unlikely(!rq->nr_running))
>                 idle_balance(cpu, rq);
is called from sched_class_fair :: load_balance_fair()
upon getting a PRE_SCHEDULE load-balancing point.
IMHO, it would look nicer this way _BUT_ yeah, this 'full' abstraction
adds additional overhead to the hot-path (which might make it not that
worthy).
