that was it, that one-line patch.  as i pointed out, the entire source
tree currently contains precisely this set of holdouts:
arch/sh/boards/landisk/landisk_pwb.c:   minor = MINOR(inode->i_rdev);
arch/sh/boards/landisk/landisk_pwb.c:   minor = MINOR(inode->i_rdev);
drivers/block/loop.c:   return i && S_ISBLK(i->i_mode) && MAJOR(i->i_rdev) == LOOP_MAJOR;
drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtv-fileops.c:        int minor = MINOR(inode->i_rdev);
include/linux/fs.h:     return MINOR(inode->i_rdev);
include/linux/fs.h:     return MAJOR(inode->i_rdev);
sound/oss/au1550_ac97.c:        int             minor = MINOR(inode->i_rdev);
  the first two are SH-related and i mailed the SH maintainer offline
about them, that previous patch was for the loop.c file, i'm not sure
who's in charge of video/ivtv (hints?), the next two lines are the
header files that define the functions, and i long ago decided not to
invest any time cleaning anything in the OSS directory.
  so, really, it's all of four lines that need to be updated to
complete the job.
