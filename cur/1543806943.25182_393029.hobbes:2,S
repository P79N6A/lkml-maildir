Thanks Andrew.
I've applied the patch and found the leak.  It's in kzalloc.  :-)
With kzalloc inlined, however, it appears that selinux is the likely
culprit.  I would not have expected that.
After running updatedb I got 23530 occurrences of:
kernel: obj ffff81003f04f000/12: ffffffff801ed7b7 <selinux_inode_alloc_security+0x37/0x100>
I'm not sure how to debug selinux issues, but at least I can disable
it.
