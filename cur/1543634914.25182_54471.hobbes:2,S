I've got that mail, and it's on my todo list.

Then we have a serious problem, because the aborts are on the order of
several seconds.  If the thread hasn't gotten scheduled by then it _should_
cause a BUG_ON.

I disagree here.  I think the clear state machine is the -only- way to get
this right.  We tried it without the state machine, and all we did was find
more and more corner cases which are not handled.

Because relying on a pointer has caused problems in the past, especially
when there are concerns that the pointer might be invalid.

The hub isn't reset, only the target device is.

I see.. thus skipping the 4 patches which address most of these issues
which are in my queue.
Look, I might not be that speedy on this, but did it at least occur to you
to contact _any_ of the other usb-storage people?  Bjorn?  Stern?

The only requirement in this condition is that the command state be
consistent at the end -- either completed or aborted.  I don't see how the
current code fails this requirement...
