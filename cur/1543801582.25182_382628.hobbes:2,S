Subject: [2.6 patch] mark virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt as __deprecated on i386
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/6/131

virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt are long deprecated, mark them as __deprecated 
on i386.
Without such warnings people will never update their code and fix 
Andrew's all*config ppc64 builds.
