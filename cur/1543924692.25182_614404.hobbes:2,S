Correct.  So a bootloader must set %ebx to zero to handle those older kernels.
Since it has always been this way we can count on it.

Sure it is reasonable to ask for.  The bootloader pipe is awfully long though.
But putting it in at the time we clean up the rules for the 32bit entry point
is the best chance we are going to get to be able to change things.
