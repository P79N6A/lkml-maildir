And then perl was invented.

It lasts until someone publishes the first perl ELF loader/executor on
bugtraq, or ruby, or python, or java. Then everyone has it.

Its more like breaking a password algorithm or everyone having the same
password unfortunately. One perl ELF loader, game over. You can do this
stuff with SELinux but even then it is very hard and you have to whack
the interpreters.
