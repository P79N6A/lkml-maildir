This isn't correct.  We want to get rid of some of the current contents
of pci-y when NUMAQ or VISWS are enabled.  I'm not quite sure what the
right fix is here.  Maybe something like ...

This mess really needs some more eyes on it.  For example, should fixups.o
really be enabled on visws but disabled on numaq?  I suspect both want
legacy.o disabled.  Does it make sense to enable ACPI on a NUMAQ system?
I don't know enough about them.
And it /really/ needs some commentary.  Here's my first cut at it, based
on my memories of editing it several years ago:
# A little more complex than most Makefiles.
# Neither the VISWS nor the NUMAQ configs want to see legacy.o compiled in.
# VISWS doesn't have ACPI to worry about, but NUMAQ might
# Order is important -- don't rearrange the order of files here.
