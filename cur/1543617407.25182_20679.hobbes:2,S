	Nope ,  The linux DAC960 driver needs 3.51-0-04 for dual flash .
	Or 2.73-0-00 for single flash .  And beleive me Leonard means what
	he put in the README.DAC960 file .
	2.73 usability is new to me as when one of these dropped into my
	hands all the driver supported was the Dual 3.51... firmware .
	Using either of the above will work on Linux ,  BUT not alpha
	vms/osf/nt .
	The cost for the items from Mylex isn't reasonable imo .  But if
	you want it & have a flash burner , Get two just like on the card
	now & download the firmware & burn it .  Don't get the XDBA
	version as IIRC the alpha boards don't support it .  But do check
	if MB you have does .  Might get lucky .
