We've had a few bugs recently where device drivers were forgetting
to set vma->vm_flags:VM_IO in their mmap() methods.
This causes kernel deadlocks when applications which have the
relevant device mapped try to dump core (the pagefault handler
deadlocks on mmap_sem).
Failing to set VM_IO also causes kernel oopses when PTRACE_PEEKUSR
tries to read the device mapping - the region has no page structs,
but access_process_vm() acts as if it does.
This patch doesn't fix the PTRACE_PEEKUSR bug - for that we need
this patch as well as the patch Andrea, Manfred and I pieced
together - it's at 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.18pre7aa2/00_get_user_pages-2
I understand that Manfred will be sending you a version of that patch.
The drivers which are forgetting to set VM_IO include a whole bunch
of fbmem drivers, one or more AGP drivers and I don't know what else.
It's simpler to make VM_IO default to `on', and to only clear it
in places where we know that it's safe to dump the memory to a
core file, and where it's safe to PTRACE_PEEKUSR it.  That's
what this patch does.  We only clear VM_IO in generic_file_mmap()
and in ncp_mmap() and in coda_file_mmap().
Any filesystem which implements its own mmap() method, and which
does not call generic_file_mmap() needs to be changed to clear
VM_IO inside its mmap function.  All in-kernel filesystems are
OK, as is XFS.  And the only breakage this can cause to out-of-kernel
filesystems is failure to include mappings in core files, and
inability to use PEEKUSR.
With this patch in place we can go through and remove the setting of
VM_IO in all the drivers which _do_ remember to set it.  But that's
a cleanup which can await 2.4.19-pre.
