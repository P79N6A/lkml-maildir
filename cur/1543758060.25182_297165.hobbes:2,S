Will do.  I assume 2.6.10 is fine?

Seems to be disk drive specific.
For instance my records show that for a:
     Maxtor model 32049h2
     20 GB
     Manufactured Mar. 2001
drive I was working with last week the maximum available capacity was
set to the native max.  At power on the max. avail. was slightly
smaller than native max.
With exactly the same computer I just tested a HPA test drive of mine:
     Hitachi Deskstar
     model HDS728080PLAT20
     82.3 GB (per label)
     Manufactured Oct. 2004
and the max. avail. was not reset.  From boot.msg
<6>hdc: max request size: 1024KiB
<6>hdc: Host Protected Area detected.
<4>	current capacity is 50001 sectors (25 MB)
<4>	native  capacity is 160836480 sectors (82348 MB)
<4>hdc: task_no_data_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
<4>hdc: task_no_data_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
<4>ide: failed opcode was: 0x37
<6>hdc: 50001 sectors (25 MB) w/1719KiB Cache, CHS=49/255/63, UDMA(100)
<7>hdc: cache flushes supported
<6> hdc: hdc1
Looking in /proc/ide/hdc/capacity after boot I show 50001 sectors.
Note this is still with the SUSE 2.6.8 vendor kernel and I don't know
what the Drive errors are, but they seem to be a driver issue, not a
hardware issue.  Concievably they are related to the behavior, but I
don't know.

Same machine / OS, just connecting different drives.  By chance, the
machine had been powered off between the 2 tests.  (It is a portable
machine that is normally locked away when not in use.)

Was 2.6.8 recent enough to have this behavior?
