 Neither of these solutions would work when booting with "init=/bin/sh" or
in "emergency" mode.  Not a nice surprise when one reverts to one of these
methods for some reason.
 Otherwise one may put an appropriate "sysinit" line that would call
insmod or modprobe at the top of inittab (before other ones or it wouldn't
work).
