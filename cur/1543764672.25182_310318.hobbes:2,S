What happened to the retransmission rates when you changed to TCP?
Note that on TCP (besides bumping the value for timeo) I would also
recommend using a full 32k r/wsize instead of 4k (if the network is of
decent quality, I'd recommend 32k for UDP too).
The other tweak you can apply for TCP is to bump the value
for /proc/sys/sunrpc/tcp_slot_table_entries. That will allow you to have
several more RPC requests in flight (although that will also tie up more
threads on the server).
Don't forget that you need to unmount then mount again after making
these changes (-oremount won't suffice).
Cheers,
  Trond
