That's why I thought you were required to make it to compile. For example
you don't know if there's another object that will cast the int pointer back to
char pointer before dereferencing. That would get a defined runtime behaviour
on all archs.
And yes, I see above I'm not allowed to say "runtime" nor "defined behaviour"
according to the standard, but that's how thing works in practice.
