I like the idea of having some kernel support for tokens.
But why PAGs?  I imagine tokens as being independent objects without any 
hierarchy.  A token group is a set of tokens.  The operations on tokens are:
read: read the raw value of the token
write: change the value of the token
execute: "use" the token (i.e. for VFS, pass over UNIX socket (to a 
privileged process, I guess).
Which gives an interesting thought: there are "anonymous" and named tokens. 
  Anonymous ones are just fds.  Named ones live in /cred/tokens.
/cred/tokens: a named token
/cred/groups/all: a magic group which has everything
/cred/groups/whatever: contains symlinks to tokens it can access
/proc/12345/tokengroup: symlink to my token group
To avoid information leaks, /cred/tokens would be readable and executable 
only by root.  You can only create symlinks to tokens you have access to. 
And you have a syscall to select a token group.
AFS's pagsh (or whatever it's called) creates a new token group and selects it.
If you really need a hierarchy, then you could allow token groups to 
contain other token groups, with the rule that the whole thing must be acyclic.
Now, if I only knew how to write filesystems...
