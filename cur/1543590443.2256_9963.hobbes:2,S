I have a proxy server that's been running 2.4.3pre4 with reiserfs for the
partitions on the cache disks. it has an uptime of 43 days at this point.
it wasn't very stable at all (two crashes in one week) with 2.4.2. I'll be
building 2.4.4 something when I get back from ghana to the US, but I don't
want to reboot it onto a fresh kernel while I'm 11,000 miles away, serial
console notwithstanding.
Overall I'm of the belief that reiserfs is robust enough for mainstream
use, and it's significantly faster than ext2 for the squid box, you do as
usal need to be a bit selective about what kernel you choose to run.
