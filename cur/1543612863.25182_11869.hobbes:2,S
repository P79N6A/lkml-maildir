For I/O bound, in this case ( since i use the average run time to weighs
the scheduler latency ), i mean tasks that runs for a very short time
before being rescheduled.
mod_perl is quite heavy from a cpu point of view and the static content,
as soon it becomes to be cached, will result in unblocking IO.
Since very likely even the HTTP response is going to be eaten by the
network layer w/out preemption, you're going to have a cpu path starting
from the HTTP request receiving from the next request fetch, that is very
likely run w/out preemption.

My point is, when the scheduler latency is going to have an impact on the
run task ?
When the average run time of the task is low.
But run time low means high dynamic priority ( counter ) that is
accumulated in consecutive recalc loops.
By having a tunable trigger point ( counter ) for task classification
( iobound-rttask or cpubound queue selection ) will make it possible to
have a runtime tuning of its value.
