Indeed. However, we have to be careful about how we do this. See
Schneier, et al's paper on catastrophic reseeding. It's better to
batch up entropy transfers rather than trickle it in.

I'm thinking of changing urandom read to avoid pulling entropy from
the primary pool (via xfer) if it falls below a given low
watermark. The important part is to prevent starvation of
/dev/random, it doesn't have to be fair.

My patches should provide sufficient entropy for any workstation use
with or without network sampling. It's only the headless case that's
problematic - see my compromise patch with trust_pct.
