Hi Frank,
I was kind of expecting this question. Well, it turns out that my markers module
modifies the struct module in module.h to add a few fields. Some drivers that I
won't name (ok, ok I will : clearcase) have the funny habit of distributing
their kernel modules as ".ko" files instead of sending a proper ".o" and later
link it against a wrapper.
The result is, I must say, quite bad : when I want to add a probe, I iterate on
each modules, verifying if there are any markers in the object. Things gets
really messy when the structure is corrupted.
The simplest way to work around this non-GPL problem is to completely disable
access to the marker infrastructure to non-GPL modules. I am not against
instrumentation of binary-only modules, but I don't think it is kernel
developer's job to support their broken binary blob distribution.
I thought that we might use the crc checksum as another criterion. As long as
the machines do not crash when adding markers when such modules are loaded.
Regards,
Mathieu
