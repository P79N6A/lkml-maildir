Hi,
My Ethernet board (Intel(R) PRO/1000) "doesn't seems" to work any more
with this kernel, but all is ok with kernel 2.6.18-rc6-mm1.
A bisection search show this patch:
gregkh-pci-pci-sort-device-lists-breadth-first.patch
as being the faulty one...
But after reading the content of this patch, I understood that the order
of the ethernet boards had changed. In fact,  I have four ethernet
boards and now, my eth0 does not point on the same card...
So all is now ok by changing my cable to the right board.
But is this really the expected behavior ?
