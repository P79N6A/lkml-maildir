Did you also measure throughput?
You are overlooking the flexibility that already exists in IP based
transports as an advantage; the fact that you can make them
distributed instead of localized with a simple addressing change
is a very powerful abstraction.

I think you may have something misconfigured.

You could implement the abstraction in user space as a library today by
having some server that muxes to several registered clients.

So whats the addressing scheme for multicast unix? Would it be a
reserved path?
I am actually indifferent: You could do this in user space for starters.
See if it buys you anything. Maybe you could do somethign clever with
passing unix file descriptors around to avoid a single server point of
failure etc.

Thats what mcast definition is. You need to weigh your options; cost is
probably worth the flexibility you get with sockets.
