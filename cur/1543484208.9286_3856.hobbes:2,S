It seems to me that Linux-native filesystems (ext, ext2, reiserfs, .....)
should all have a filesystem tag at the beginning indicating to mount, the
kernel, or whomever what type they are.  While the partition-type
mechanism available on PCs is perhaps useful for such things, it does not
offer necessary flexibility (many fs's, fs versions,....).  Proposal:
version, and the number of bytes.  If this is
really not causing any problems, forget I wrote this.
Any flames will get stuck in my new fireplace, and will be used to keep me
toasty next winter.
