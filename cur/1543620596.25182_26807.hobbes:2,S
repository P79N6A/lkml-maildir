Thanks for the help,
problem (under 2.5.3) however,
root@paule:/lib/modules/2.5.3/kernel/drivers/net# insmod 3c59x
Using /lib/modules/2.5.3/kernel/drivers/net/3c59x.o
/lib/modules/2.5.3/kernel/drivers/net/3c59x.o: unresolved symbol 
del_timer_sync
Which would probably be why it isnt loaded at boot time either :(
Any help would be appreciated.
