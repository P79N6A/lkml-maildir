That doesn't happen. malloc() ALLOCATES the memory to the process. It is
*NOT* overcommitted. It may be backed by swapspace rather than physical
memory, but that block of memory *IS* available to the process.

malloc() does this. fork() doesn't, because there is no memory to
allocate. The whole point of fork() is that you are *NOT* simply
duplicating the in-VM image of the process! VERY early Linux kernels did
this - and had problems spawning multiple shells, never mind actually
running processes, as a result.

Nope.
