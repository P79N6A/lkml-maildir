Too bad it doesn't.

Unless I'm mistaken, we need both use counts and SMP magic (though not
necessarily as extreme as what the "freeze all other CPUs during module
unload" patch did).
I think something like this would work (in addition to use counts)
int callin_func(void *p)
{
	int *cpu = p;
	while (*cpu != smp_processor_id()) {
		current->cpus_allowed = 1 << *cpu;
		schedule();
	}
	return 0;
}
void callin_other_cpus(void)
{
	int cpus[smp_num_cpus];
	int i;
	for (i=0; i<smp_num_cpus; i++) {
		cpus[i] = i;
		kernel_thread(callin_func, &cpus[i], ...);
	}
}
and call callin_other_cpus() before unloading a module.
I'm not sure how you could make exception handling safe without locking
all accesses to the module list - but that sounds like the sane thing to
do anyway.
