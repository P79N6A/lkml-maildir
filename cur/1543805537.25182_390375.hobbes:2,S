Is there any reason you might need those per-CPU statistics in an atomic
snapshot form?  That seems unlikely, off the top of my head.  You could
either have a per-CPU directory with a file for each counter, which
seems cleanest, or a per-CPU file with all counters and the name of
each, although the format wants cleaning compared to what you have now.
