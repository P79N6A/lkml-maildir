That would only work if there is nothing to dump (cb->dump returns 0).
Otherwise it is not freed.

Yes, but for kernel sockets we end up calling the input function,
which when mutex_trylock is used returns immediately when some
other process is already processing the queue, so the requesting
process might close the socket before the request is processed.
