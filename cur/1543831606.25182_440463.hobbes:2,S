Yes.  Note that it's not quite there yet.  Non-genirq architectures currently
have things like enable_irq/disable_irq in asm/irq.h  We really need to have
those prototypes only in linux/interrupt.h.  Unfortunately at least m68k and
sparc had those as macros so they'll need some tweaking first.

I find the name rather odd, how bout linux/genirq.h instead?

Note that currently asm/irq.h is included all over.

Yes.

I'm not sure we can get away with just one asm/*irq.h.  We need arch
bits for genirq and we need arch bits for what was in linux/hardirq.h
and I don't think we want to mix those up.  The latter is just irq_cpustat_t
which needs a big rework anyway to remove the arch independent use of a arch-
defined struct and use DECLARE_PERCPU for each field in each architecture
or a suitable per-arch meachnism.  The only irq_cpustat_t field that the
generic code uses is __softirq_pending and we should rather have a function
abstraction for that.
