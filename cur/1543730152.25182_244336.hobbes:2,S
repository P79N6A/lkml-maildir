May I suggest that get_random_bytes() be called *outside* of the
spinlocked region on a temporary buffer, assuming that the SHA
algorithm is the problem here?
Something like this (untested):
   u32 tmp[sizeof(keyptr->secret)/4];      /* on stack */
   get_random_bytes(tmp, sizeof(tmp));
   spin_lock_bh(&ip_lock);
   memcpy(keyptr->secret, tmp, sizeof(keyptr->secret));
   /* ... other housekeeping ... */
   spin_unlock_bh(&ip_lock);
