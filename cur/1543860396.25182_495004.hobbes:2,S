One could surely apply that argument to hundreds of places throughout
the kernel ... that doesn't make it a good one.  One of the downfalls
of many "object oriented programming" efforts was this same desire to
encapsulate things that don't need it; it's lose, not a don't-care.
Think of it as "cookies represented by integers" if you like.

You're welcome to dream on.  :)
The goal here is not to create new complexity, it's to wrap the
current widely used abstraction (gpios are integers, with get/set
primitives and a direction) in a neutral programming interface
that's very easy to map to/from the current arch-specific ones.
So that various drivers can get on with the business of being
generally useful, rather than arch-specific; or at least being
easier to read.  See the example PXA patch I recently posted;
it's a code shrink, and *direct* translation from the current
GPIO interface (which uses integers).

Those words were yours; so you can consider that already done.
Should it instead say that's an (obviously unchecked) error?
The "no error returns" was an explicit request from several folk
during earlier API discussions.  People actually _using_ GPIOs have
no use for faults on those known-valid get/set calls.  Seriously,
exactly how could you ever recover from register access no longer
working correctly?  The chip is in the process of exploding, or
being crushed; what could software possibly do to recover?

You are perverting what _I_ said.  (As you've done before; stop that.)
It's very clear that I was talking about a tradeoff ("better than"), and
pointing out how Linus' rule made it clear that your proposal was on the
wrong end of things.  (His rule being that BUG should not be used unless
the system really can't continue operating.)
In terms of API specs, emitting any warning is traditionally out-of-scope.
Because "of course" it's legit for debug modes to do all kinds of things,
including emitting warnings; and likewise it's legit for non-debug modes
to do nothing not absolutely required.  And programming interface specs
have no business in "quality of implementation" issues like whether any
implementation even _has_ a debug mode, much less what it covers.

Which -- that portable code mustn't try such things?  That seems clearly
wrong; that's what the "is an error" phrase means.  Or that code should
not need an obscure API for nonportable tricks like that?  That seems
wrong too; that's one of the reasons to specify things as "unchecked".
Or that implementations shouldn't be required to guard against that
behavior in layers above?  Same comment about "unchecked".
I think you must have missed the class in "how to write API specs" which
discussed how to accomodate nonportable behaviors; it's a given that if
there are more than two implementations of the interface, such things are
going to exist.  One of the options is to just declare such things as
clearly out-of-scope for the API, and just wash your hands of what some
implementaiton will be doing (regardless of what you write down).  In
this case, that's what happened.
And again, remember that if your implementation (not architecture!) wants
to have a (debug) mode that warns about marginal might-be-trouble cases,
that's always legit.
