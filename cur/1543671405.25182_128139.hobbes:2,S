I'm afraid I did not explain myself clearly. I fear that the format is 
both too short, and not descriptive enough. I think taking only the real 
name from the email would server both the purpose of searching the list, 
and the purpose of understanding who submitted the patch simpler.
The anti spam part was the fact that my email (for the purpose of this 
list) is lkml@shemesh.biz, which leaves an awfully undescriptive "lkml" 
in CVS. This allows neither searching nor accounting. As I'm sure other 
people use the exact same technique when posting to a mailing list, 
searching for someone who's email is lkml@* will not even be unique.
I hope my intention was clearer this time.
