This came up when I was working on the v4l-dvb tree's out of kernel build
system.  It uses the same Kconfig files, but I've created a config system in
perl to parse and evaluate them.  It will disable options that the kernel
config programs allow, and it is because I'm treating this situation
differently:  Since "B" is disabled because "A" is off, "C" must also be
disabled.
Another way of dealing with this would be to have 'select' follow the
dependency chain back up.  Turning on C selects B, B depends on A, so A is
also selected.
One problem with this is that "depends on" can take complex expressions.
Finding the solution is NP complete, which likely isn't a problem for the
sizes of realistic Kconfig files.  But there could easily be multiple
solutions, so which one is the right one?
