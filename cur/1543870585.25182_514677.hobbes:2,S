Yes, I thought about its extension more than a year ago before started 
kevent, but epoll() is absolutely based on file structure and its 
file_operations with poll methodt, so it is quite impossible to work 
with sockets to implement network AIO. Eventually it had gathered a lot 
of other systems - do we really want to have per process signalfs, timerfs 
and so on - each simple structure must be bound to a file, which becomes 
too cost.
