Yes, and that's perfectly fine. You're description is correct for a
somewhat loose sense of sync(), not equal to sync(2), but meaning 'some
call that will send buffers down the i/o request queue to the hardware'.

That's where you are wrong: Your system is not idle at all. It's executing
/bin/date, and it's executing /sbin/hdparm.

Here is what happens: Your script generates loads of dirty buffers. How?
It's all read-only? Not quite. Try the following:
while true; do /bin/date; ls -l -u /bin/date; sleep 60; done
Each invocation of /bin/date will update its atime, yielding a dirty
buffer that kupdate will happily send down to the disk after some time,
based on your bdflush settings. With a standard bdflush setup, kupdate
wakes up every five seconds. Non-superblock dirty buffers have to age 30
seconds before they are ripe to be flushed to disk. So running your skript
will send an i/o command to the disk after 30-35 seconds. The IDE bus
reset necessary as you spun down your disk with hdparm -Y rather than
hdparm -y takes a few seconds as well, yielding a total of 39 seconds for
your drive to become active again.
The point being: If you want your disk to stay down, mount with option
noatime, or <SPAM>use noflushd</SPAM>.
Regards,
Daniel.
