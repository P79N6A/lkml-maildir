Not so.  A and B are different memory locations, hence #2 does not
apply to the "STORE A; STORE B" sequence.

The key phrase is "to a given -single- memory location".  ;-)
A and B are presumably -different- memory locations.  However, if A and
B are aliases for the same memory location, then the wmb() would in fact
be unnecessary.  But, again, I am assuming that they are different, so
that #2 does not apply.
