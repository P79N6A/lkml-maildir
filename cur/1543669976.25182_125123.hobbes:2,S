I really think that whether the driveid needs swapping should be
regarded as a property of the interface, not of the system as a whole.
I like the idea of adding a "read in driveid" function pointer to the
ide_hwif_t structure.  Most systems would set that to the same as the
INSW function pointer.  For those systems where the hardware designer
suffered a momentary dizzy spell we can set it to point to a function
that does the necessary byte-swapping.
Paul.
