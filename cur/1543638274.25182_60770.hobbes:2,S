They should be waiting in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, and we should add a flag 
to distinguish between "increases load average" and "doesn't". So you 
could have
	TASK_WAKESIGNAL - wake on all signals
	TASK_WAKEKILL	- wake on signals that are deadly
	TASK_NOSIGNAL	- don't wake on signals
	TASK_LOADAVG	- counts toward loadaverage
	#define TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE	(TASK_NOSIGNAL | TASK_LOADAVG)
	#define TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE	TASK_WAKESIGNAL
and then people who wanted to could use other combinations. The
TASK_WAKEKILL thing is useful - there are many loops that cannot exit
until they have a result, simply because the calling conventions require 
that. Th emost common example is disk wait.
HOWEVER, if they are killed by a signal, the calling convention doesn't
matter, and the read() or whatever could just return 0 (knowing that the
process will never see it), and leave a locked page locked. Things like 
generic_file_read() could easily use this, and make processes killable 
even when they are waiting for a hung NFS mount - regardless of any soft 
mount issues, and without NFS having to have special code.
In the end, I'm too lazy, and I don't care. So I can only tell you how it 
_should_ be done, and maybe you can tell somebody else until the sucker to 
actually do it is found.
