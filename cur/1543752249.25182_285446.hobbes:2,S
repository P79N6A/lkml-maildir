Tested, works as intended for me.
Simone, you might revert
  
http://khali.linux-fr.org/devel/i2c/linux-2.6/linux-2.6.10-rc3-i2c-it87-manual-pwm.diff
and apply this new patch instead. This won't solve the polarity issue
but at least the fans won't stop when you load the it87 driver.
We can now move to the second part of the plan. Stay tuned :)
