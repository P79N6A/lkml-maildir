Hello,
while writing a backup using tar from NFS to a SCSI tape I had an soft-
lockup of the system, i.e. the only thing working was sysreq.
This effect is 100% repeatable.
I managed to capture some EIP values:
c0107921 cpu_idle+0x41
c01d1074 __udelay
c01d1070 __delay+0x20
c01d4d73 stext_lock+0x234f, sorry no symbols near that one
c01d4d7a
c01d1070 __delay+0x20
c01d10a6 __udelay+0x32
The system is based on Dual-PentiumII, 233MHz,
Gigabyte GA-686LX2 motherboard. The kernel is compiled with
egcs 1.1.2.
