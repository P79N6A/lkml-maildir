Did you try? I can't think of any valid reason why it wouldn't work.
All SMBus transactions are compatible with I2C by definition.
Now performance might be better with dedicated code if the hardware
accelerate SMBus transactions, that's a different issue. If you prefer
to keep the smbus_xfer method for performance reasons, that's OK with
me. After all you're the one who will have to maintain the driver ;)
