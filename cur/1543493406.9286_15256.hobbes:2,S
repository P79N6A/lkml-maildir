It _is_ harebrained: You want to make the system secure by auditing each
capable piece of software (at least those with dangerous capabilities,
however defined), and for stuff like the Perl interpreter this is hopeless,
or at least makes the whole exercise pointless.
And again, what is going to stop me from faking capabilities in the script
when I write it?
