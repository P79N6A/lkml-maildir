What about a hardware time source that can be safely accessed with a fast
system call (f.e. via epc on IA64)? My tests indicate that such an
implementation is comparable to a user space memory mapped solution. The
user space memory mapping might generate complexities. Especially since
the page mapped for a memory mapped timer may allow access to hardware
information that should not be exposed to user space.
The time interpolator patches that I posted a while back provide a
generic interface to timer registers / values which may be useful to what
you are trying to accomplish. The C code for that patch is platform
independent but there is also an asm fast path that is specific to IA64.
Other arches could develop similar fastpaths.

The nanoseconds patch that was accepted into 2.6.9-rc1 does do that
partially by providing a getnstimeofday and centralizing the instances
where microseconds are multiplied by 1000 get to nanoseconds.

May we would need 128bit arithmetic to increase the accurary of the
scaling?

Most arches have already high res time sources. I think we just need to
make proper use of them.

Some intelligent timer needs to survive the suspend. Timers may need an
attribute to show if they continue counting through suspense/resume etc
(various power conditions etc....)
Hope this helps ....
