You have to use the the pdc202xx.c file in the taskfile patch on
http:://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hedrick/ide.2.4.0-t5-2.all.4c.patch.bz2
If this fails add your drive to the quirk list in pdc202xx.c and try
again.  Some drives are doing things like auto-clearing the interrupt
during a specific taskfile command in ide-features.
If this still fails, then send me the drive data and will go back to the
vender.
Cheers,
