okay, i don't really want to prolong this debate any longer, but why not put
something in Documentation/Configure.help along the lines of "warning: gcc
2.96 has been known to cause errors with reiserfs!  if it goes weird on you,
_upgrade (or downgrade) your compiler and re-compile your kernel_."
imho Configure.help would be one of the best places to put notices such as
these.
