I have a machine running web server. It has a lot of httpd's loaded and
most of them are sleeping. The load average is always around 7-13, so I
wonder why the CPU usage doesn't reach ~100%. It wastes CPU time or
simply there is something top does not show ?
top output:
  4:40pm  up 1 day,  3:07,  5 users,  load average: 12.78, 12.95, 11.93
349 processes: 342 sleeping, 1 running, 6 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU states: 14.9% user, 42.4% system,  0.0% nice, 42.6% idle
Mem:  387700K av, 373636K used,  14064K free, 319580K shrd,  21584K buff
Swap: 136512K av,      0K used, 136512K free                277616K cached
kernel 2.2.6 UP
Bye.
