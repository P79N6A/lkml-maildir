Hi Mauro,
Today's (and for a few days now) linux-next build (x86_64 allmodconfig)
of a pristine Linus tree fails like this:
/opt/crosstool/gcc-4.0.2-glibc-2.3.6/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-ld: drivers/media/built-in.o: No such file: No such file or director
I have been applying the following patch, but would prefer a real fix in
upstream ASAP.
