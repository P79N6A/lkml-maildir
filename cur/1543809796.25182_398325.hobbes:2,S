Fair enough.  I guess it certainly shrinks the set.  But, I _really_
think we need it before it gets into the hands of too many customers.  I
hate to tell people to reboot boxes, and I hate adding boot options.
If people start using kernelcore=, we're stuck with it for a long time.
Why not just make the system flexible from the beginning?  I hate
introducing hacky boot options only to have them removed 2 kernel
revisions later when we fix it properly.
Maybe the kernelcore= patch is a good candidate to stay in -mm during
the transition time, but not ever follow along into mainline.  Dunno.

But, if you get the EasyRclm to DMA transition working properly, this
problem goes away.  So, if you solve a problem in the kernel, the user
gets fewer ways to screw up, _and_ you have less code to deal with that
part of the user interface.

I missed that.  Is that my fault for not looking closely enough, or the
patch's fault for being a bit obtuse? ;)
I think it is pretty bogus to just punt when it sees a memory hole.
They really need to me dealt with properly.  Otherwise, you'll never
hear about it until a customer complains that kernelcore= isn't working
and they can't remove memory or use hugetlb pages on two "identical"
systems.
