> It's fine for testing purposes, leave it in.
absolutely.  it could also be needed for interoperability, or many other
valid uses that might not depend on its sheer strength as a cipher.
"but you shouldn't be interoperating with things that are insecure!"
blah blah blah.  that is not the kernel's decision to make.  meaningful
security is defined by much more than context-free assertions.  warn
against its naive use, avoid it being a default, but allow the clued to
use it easily when it makes sense.
