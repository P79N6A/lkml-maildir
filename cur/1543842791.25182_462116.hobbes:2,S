Subject: 2.6.18-rc: EMBEDDED menu is split up

In menuconfig, I enabled CONFIG_EMBEDDED in the "general setup" menu
and all of the submenu items starting with "enable futex support" appeared
in the main menu instead of the submenu:
         [*] Configure standard kernel features (for small systems)  --->                
         [*] Enable futex support (NEW)                                                  
         [*] Enable eventpoll support (NEW)                                              
         [*] Use full shmem filesystem (NEW)                                      
         [*] Use full SLAB allocator (NEW)                                          
         [*] Enable VM event counters for /proc/vmstat (NEW)                      
Two more items also appear, but they're _above_ the submenu prompt:
         [*] Sysctl support (NEW)                                                        
         [*] Enable 16-bit UID system calls (NEW)                                        
Should these be moved into the submenu?
