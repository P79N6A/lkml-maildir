I agree. I found the reason seems some strange there. reset call set
a 50ms's wait handler and return to user at once, when succeed in
the first poll and handler return, there's always about another 50ms
needed to cleanup the path(I once tested values lager and smaller
than 50ms and found about 48ms needed at least on my box).  so
the following call would race it if there's no such a delay, although
there's actually few chances to do continuous reset call, I thought.

I think it is.
