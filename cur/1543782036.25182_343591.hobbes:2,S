Well that's the problem; you're presuming that an (eventual)
schedule_timeout(HZ/25) call would actually sleep for HZ/25 jiffies.
More than likely, though, it may sleep a little longer. Generally,
code that is trying to sleep up to a certain time from now should use
time_after() or time_before().

1) Makes this code consistent with other users in the kernel (Although
I have tried to reduce the number of users of the sleep_on() family).
2) If HZ eventually is allowed to take other values (e.g., 864 for
x86), then HZ/25 leads to rounding issues. msecs_to_jiffies() takes
care of those issues *and* makes it a little clear what you're doing,
IMO.
