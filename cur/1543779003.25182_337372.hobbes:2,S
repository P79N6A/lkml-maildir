Subject: [patch 3/4] s390: device recognition.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/29/193

From: Cornelia Huck <cohuck@de.ibm.com>
Close a small window where a device may be not operational again after
senseid finished and the "same device" check fails due to dev=0000 by
checking for dnv after stsch() by then setting the device to not
operational. (No need to check for dnv in ccw_device_handle_oper() again
since we don't do stsch() into the subchannel's schib in the meantime
and will get a crw anyway if the device becomes not oper again).
