Heh, you are the second person to suggest this check today, do I detect
some ripped out hair due to one of these!
I've taken this idea and expanded it to cover if, for and while which
can all suffer from this.  Using the relative indent to work out which
are valid combinations:
WARNING: Trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies
otherwise
#28: FILE: Z17.c:25:
+       if (foo);
+               return 10;
WARNING: Trailing semicolon indicates no statements, indent implies
otherwise
#31: FILE: Z17.c:28:
+       for (a; b; c);
+               a += *b;
Thanks for the patch.
