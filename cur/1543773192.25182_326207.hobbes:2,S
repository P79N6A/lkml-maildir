Ivan:
I tried the patch that seems to work for Andreas.  It does not appear to
change the behavior of my machine in the slightest.  
And on my ASUS board(2.6.12-rc6 w/git8 and ur patch), I get the
following:
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 0 of device 0000:02:00.0
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 3 of device 0000:04:00.0
PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #3:1000000@fe000000 for
PCI: Bridge: 0000:00:0e.0
Where 02:00.0 is the USB controller, 04:00.0 is the sound card and
00:0e.0 is the bridge for the Broadcom ethernet adapter.
I posted the entire lspci, dmesg and a barf from the tg3 module in the
following post:

I have contacted ASUS for more assistance, but like their web site, it
is intermittent at best.  
What can be done at this point?
Sean
