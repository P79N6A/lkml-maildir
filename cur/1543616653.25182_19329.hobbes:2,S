It would have been even saner to give that bit some sane name, and have
something like
	#define YMFPCI_XXXBIT (__constant_cpu_to_le32(0x40000000))
instead of creating a totally nonsensical random number.
I applied your patch, but if I had created that code I would be too
ashamed to post such a patch on a public mailing list.
