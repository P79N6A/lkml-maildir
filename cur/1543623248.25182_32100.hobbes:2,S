I'd appreciate it if you could go in to more detail off list, out of
a general interest I have here.

Unfortunately not today or probably earlier this week as I'm about to be
150 miles away from the office back in the land of cs.nott.ac.uk and am
planning to avoid late night sysrq fun over a serial console this week :-)

Well, at least this kernel should have kernel debugging enabled so if/when
it happens again or I get chance to look at it over this week I'll lookup
where it's happening - for now all I need to know is that loopback still
isn't kosher on 2.4 and I need to avoid it by using a 2.2 box or whatever.
