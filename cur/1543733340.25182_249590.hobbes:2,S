 Where is the difference? Both would be handled by a specific driver
 or module and export the same semantics (files+dirs) with permissions
 etc to the user. With your idea you still would need the userfs
 kernel module, and with "magic plugins", as you said, you will need a
 vfs/reiser4 kernel plugin.

  No there are _usability_ differences. I cirtanly do not want to
  mount lots of files with mount -t userfs, just to see extra
  meta-data that I want to quickly be able to use. And it also
  wouldn't work generically (searchable) with tools like find, grep,
  etc either.
