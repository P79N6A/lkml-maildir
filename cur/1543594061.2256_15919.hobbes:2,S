wrong, the sec field of xtime is read all the time without any lock.
so xtime can change under you it has to be declared volatile or C
language will screwup. gcc 3.0 effectively spotted a bug in the kernel
that wasn't exporting xtime as volatile.
Right fix is this that I did just about 10 minutes ago after the 3.0
checkout ;)
