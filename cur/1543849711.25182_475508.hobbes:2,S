The use of cpu_exclusive for sched domain partitioning was added
later, by a patch from Dinikar, in April or May of 2005.
In hindsight, I think I made a mistake in agreeing to, and probably
encouraging, this particular overloading of cpu_exclusive.  I had
difficulty adequately understanding what was going on.
Granted, as we've noted elsewhere on this thread, the cpu_exclusive
flag is underutilized.  It gives cpusets so marked a certain limited
exclusivity to its cpus, relative to its siblings, but it doesn't do
much else, other than this controversial partitioning of sched domains.
There may well be a useful role for the cpu_exclusive flag in managing
sched domains and partitioning.  The current role is flawed, in my view.
