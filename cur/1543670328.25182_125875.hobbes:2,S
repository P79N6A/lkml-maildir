Yes, it is possible,  at least using ftp. If you create ftp, or ftp-like 
service that
allow only storing data in one particular directory for each user 
account (or server
account if we would like to name it this way) and no listing directory 
or reading
files (just a matter of file/dir permissions) then we got the solution. 
Server must
ensure that no one could read or delete a file.
It is even possible to create service with anonymous login. It should serve
one directory, for writing only (no read or list operations) as in 
previous case.
Users should store files with uniqe names, to prevent write errors when new
file have the same name as previously created.
It meets all your requirements. And it is possible to configure almost 
all common
ftp deamons to do their work this way.
