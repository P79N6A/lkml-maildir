And what is the difference between static linking, and dynamic
linking that requires a specially distributed shared library that
must be used?
I fail to see the difference.  If the shared library isn't the
one that everything else on the system uses, then IT ISN'T
SHARED.  In other words, if commercial program A required library
B to be used, and only program A is using it, then nothing is
sharing the library, and the application might as well statically
link in the first place as it will consume the same resources,
and perhaps be a bit slower due to dynamic linking.

Agreed, but unlikely.
