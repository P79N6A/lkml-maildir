remap unicode character missing in filesystem codepage into something like '?'.
I believe this is what nls routines do if converter returns -1 (error).
You'd loose the new characters, right. But you'd loose them anyway, as they
have no place in mac software.

just fix that software instead of polluting the kernel.
And besides: software which _does_ work with unicode,
can make a good use of an nls module for HFS.
