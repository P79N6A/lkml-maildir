Looks like you are getting hit by contention on files_lock. I have
been messing around with some code to split up the files_lock, but
I can't seem to get the locking in the tty layer right.
Hmm.. .text.lock.namei is probably dcache_lock. -mms no longer has
dcache_rcu, so not quite sure what helped you here.
Thanks
