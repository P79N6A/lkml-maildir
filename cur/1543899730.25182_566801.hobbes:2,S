Nothing is a "big issue" if you can force someone else to do the work. 
And if you have no impact from a production outage if some new driver 
works for hours and then does something unexpected.

If this was a case of a kernel change requiring an effort to keep the 
driver I would not be suggesting someone take time to update the driver 
from threads to tasklets or fartlets or whatever the next ultimate irq 
handling happens to be. But when there's zero effort at the moment to 
retain the driver, I think it's change for the sake of change.
