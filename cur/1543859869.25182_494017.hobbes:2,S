So that mean's we'll have 2 separate mechanisms for marking
pages as delalloc. XFS uses the BH_delay flag to indicate
that a buffer (block) attached to the page is using delalloc.
FWIW, how does this mechanism deal with block size < page size?
Don't you have to track delalloc on a block basis rather than
a page basis?

Ah, that's why you can get away with a page flag - you've ignored
the partial page delay state problem. Any plans to use the
existing method in the future so we will be able to use ext4 delalloc
on machines with a page size larger than 4k?
Cheers,
Dave.
