To follow up on my previous postings of a long while ago.
I have a very boring trackpad mouse on a Sony VAIO R505JE laptop.  At 
least, 2.4.18-pre7 thinks it's normal PS/2 and uninteresting.  2.5.3-dj* 
on the other hand, seems to be horribly confused.  I rebuilt it with 
everything mouse related as modules just so I didn't have to reboot when 
it misdetected my mouse.
First, I modprobe mousedev, then psmouse.
Mousedev always is cool and loads without a problem, printing out its 
"PS/2 mouse device common for all mice" message.
~90% of the time, psmouse does not detect a mouse.  Doesn't work, obviously.
~5% of the time, psmouse reports I have a "PS/2 Generic Mouse on 
isa0060/serio1".
    At such times, the mouse works, but a complete cross on the trackpad 
is ~100 pixels at best.
~1% of the time, psmouse blurts "Failed to enable mouse on 
isa0060/serio1"  Here the mouse does not work.
~4% of the time, psmouse prints "PS/2 Logitech Mouse on isa0060/serio1" 
 This is the correct mode of behavior.
As it is I run "modprobe mousedev; while < /dev/zero; do modprobe 
psmouse; echo -n "a"; sleep 1; done" and wait for the Logitech message 
to give the loop a Ctrl-C.  There has to be a better way, and more 
information I can provide.
FYI, keyboard glitches *seem* to have disappeared.
