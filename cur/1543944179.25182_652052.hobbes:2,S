Badari-san.
Which function does call unregister_memory() or unregister_memory_section()?
I can't find its caller in current 2.6.24-mm1.
???????()

  |nothing calls?

  +-->unregister_memory_section()
       |
       |call
       |
       +---> remove_memory_block()
              |
              |call
              |
              +----> unregister_memory()
unregister_memory_section() is only externed in linux/memory.h.
Do you have any another patch to call it?
I think it is necessary for physical memory removing.
If you have not posted it or it is not merged to -mm,
I can understand why this bug remains.
If you posted it, could you point it to me?
Or do I misunderstand something?
Thanks.
