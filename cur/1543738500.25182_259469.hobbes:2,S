Any reason why this totally broken code was ever merged upstream ?
We debated that again and again... the result of the below code is
to _REMOVE_ useful information from PCI drivers (suspend to disk vs.
suspend to RAM) for no good reason, making PCI drivers suddently
take a different state than any other driver, breaking radeonfb
suspend code, etc....
I insist again and again (with WORKING code here that does both
suspend-to-RAM & to-disk when not broken by patches like that)
that this is the WRONG thing to do, there is no such generic
correspondance between a suspend state and a PCI D state, this
is under driver or platform control, and this just makes things
more confusing for everybody.
Please, revert that to something sane before 2.6.9... I'll be an
asshole on this one and the bunch of PPC suspend-to-disk patch I'll
submit after 2.6.9 will contain a patch reverting that if not done
and I'll bomb it ever and ever again until some sense gets into
all of this.
Ben.
