 Extract of RBIL61:
INT 10 - VIDEO - SCROLL UP WINDOW
	AH = 06h
	AL = number of lines by which to scroll up (00h = clear entire window)
	BH = attribute used to write blank lines at bottom of window
	CH,CL = row,column of window's upper left corner
	DH,DL = row,column of window's lower right corner
Return: nothing
Note:	affects only the currently active page (see AH=05h)
BUGS:	some implementations (including the original IBM PC) have a bug which
	  destroys BP
	the Trident TVGA8900CL (BIOS dated 1992/9/8) clears DS to 0000h when
	  scrolling in an SVGA mode (800x600 or higher)
 Scrolling is only (and automatically) done if the cursor is at bottom right.

  "mov %fs:(%ebx,%eax,4),%ecx" works for me.
 Etienne.
