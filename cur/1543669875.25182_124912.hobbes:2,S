That doesn't convince me (yet?). Why doesn't 2.4.20-pre5-ac3 break
mozilla, but 2.4.20.1 does? If mozilla depends on this information, it
should at least have a robust parser for it.
Can you give me a little more details on this? Did anyone ever declare
that userspace can expect kernel versions to fit this regex?
\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-.+)?
