It's not so much whether they NEED their own scheduler, etc. as whether 
it should be possible for them to have their own scheduler, etc.  With a 
configurable scheduler (such as ZAPHOD) this could just be a matter of 
having separate configuration variables for each cpuset (e.g. if a 
cpuset has been created to contain as bunch of servers there's no need 
to try and provide good interactive response for its tasks (as none of 
them will be interactive) so the interactive response mechanism can be 
turned off in that cpuset leading to better server response and throughput).
