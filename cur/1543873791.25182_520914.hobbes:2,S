Hi, I tried to send this before but I'm not sure it got through.
All I wanted to say was that this version does not improve my
problem with Wengophone (tested with 2.6.21-rc4). Otherwise it
seems to run fine. I won't be able to test anything new for
about a month, but I guess by then it'll be perfect anyway :)
