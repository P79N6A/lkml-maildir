Ingo, I don't think this is the fix.
You should check Softirqs on return from every single IRQ.
In do_softirq() it will make sure that we won't run softirqs
while already doing so or being already nested in a hard-IRQ.
Every port works this way, I don't know where you got this "soft-IRQs
cannot run when returning to kernel code" rule, it simply doesn't
exist.
And looking at the x86 code, I don't even understand how your fixes
can make a difference, what about the do_softirq() call in
arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:do_IRQ()???  That should be taking care of all
these "error cases" right?
