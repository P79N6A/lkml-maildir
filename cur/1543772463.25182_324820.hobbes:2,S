	There are three options for Memhole mapping in my BIOS:  Disabled, Hardware, 
and Software.  I really don't know why there would be a "software" option, or 
what it does.  Also, I'm not sure what the difference between continuous and 
discrete MTRR mapping is.  The BIOS says it has to do with some linux 
kernels, but I haven't found any reliable information about it.
I disabled Memhole mapping and PREEMPT entirely.  I'll try to stress test out 
some more oopses.  I'll also memtest86 all of the memory.
Thanks for the help,
Jake Martin
