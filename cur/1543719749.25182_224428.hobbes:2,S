No.  tsk == current for __exit_sighand.  You know, getting current is SO
expensive, and so we should PASS IT to functions explicitly!
One of my pet gripes: this code is badly obfuscated by this.  Is it just
me?

Hmm, while we're at it, the task seems to release itself while running
here: exit_notify() -> release_task() -> put_task_struct() ->
__put_task_struct() -> BOOM?
Surely not, what am I missing?

Hmm, a per-cpu cache of exited tasks: one task for each CPU.  We hold a
reference to the task struct until the next exit on the same CPU
happens?  We could also reuse that cache for fork()...
