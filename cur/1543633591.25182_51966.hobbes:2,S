There is a well known problem with 'intr': if one process is waiting on the 
page lock, then there is no provision for interrupting (that's a known 
weakness with the MM layer).
Since taking the page lock is usually done by some process that wants to read 
from a page, the usual cause of such a hangup is the fact that some other 
process is in the middle of an NFS READ. For this reason, if you kill *all* 
READ operations (by doing 'killall -9 rpciod) then you can usually recover. 
That's something that is only possible for 'root' though...

As I said, all the client is required to do is to retry (unless it gets 
interrupted). I'm not sure what else you mean by 'recover' in the above 
sentence.
