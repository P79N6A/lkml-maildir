because we always need new features, even on older hardware. If 2.4 didn't
support my 386sx, I would have had to either port iptables, cramfs, pppoe
and such things to 2.0 (or 2.2), or replace this solid-state, silent box
with a new, noisy and power hungry one. I'm really happy that this box is
still supported and hope it will still run 2.6.
Cheers,
Willy
