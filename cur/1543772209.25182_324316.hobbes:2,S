Ok.  I can confirm that linux-2.6.12-rc6-mm1 + just this fix boots fine
and works.  And yes I said works?  I can't understand why backing the
others out left us with the odd spin hang and this combination doesn't.
 I've managed to run 4 sets of boot and kernbench (10 runs) without a hang.
/me feels there is something else ugly in here we don't want but
unrelated to this patch.
