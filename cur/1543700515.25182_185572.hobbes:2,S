I just did all this last weekend, and the basic operation I use is:
 - two passes at standard mode (this bombed for me at first, so adjust
timings/etc and repeat)
 - two passes at enhanced mode (this bombed on me once, so timings again
and restart from the beginning)
 - and (I skipped this) one pass at 'all' mode, just to be sure
Once it passes 2 standard and 2 enhanced, its a safe bet that it's
clean..
