A lot of driver writers probably aren't going to even start updating
until the stable release is released. IIRC there are many vendors etc.
who focus exclusively on stable kernel releases, and who will let their
code (e.g. drivers) bitrot the entire way through the development cycle.
And there is plenty of code that is being updated now for the first
time since 2.0.x, and some arches that haven't merged since before 2.4.0
