In the approach we are suggesting, at the minimum, glibc readdir would
have to maintain a unified cache of dirents with the knowlege of
whiteouts (DT_WHT). Would that be too much ?

Not really. In Union Mount, most of the unification support is done at
VFS layer with some support from filesystems (for things like
whiteouts). It is Unionfs which implements a new filesystem to achieve
unification. Unification is not purely a kernel filesystem's problem, it
involves both VFS and FS.

AFAIK, even BSD implements duplicate elimination and whiteout
suppression in the userland.
Thanks for your comments.
