Hi!
I have a problem.
We have an network with Windows NT machines, and Linux boxes for www ftp
mail samba and firewall/gateway(masq).
The problem is that if i run PCAnywhere from an NT box, it locks up solid.
Nothing in the logs, no response whatsoever with the keyboard (num lock
don't work).
No pinging. Not a thing that can give away what's locking up the box.
The box is an i586 300Mhz with two eepro100b's in it. It has 128MB mem and
about 48Gig in four IDE HD's.
What can i do to trace stuff?
As far as i know what the thing i did last was compiling kernel with ip
aliasing and the configs do make iproute2 work.
Tell me what i can do, and if i can provide more info.

P.S. Please CC me coz i'm not on the list.
