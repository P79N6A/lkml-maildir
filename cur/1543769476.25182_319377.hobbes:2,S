Unfortunately no, at least not on a clustered level. Local node, those
should work as normal. If you absolutely need this functionality, I believe
OpenSSI currently supports it.
If you're looking for an easy way to share small amounts data between
applications in an OCFS2 cluster, you might be interested in looking at
dlmfs. Once mounted, it's quite trivial to create dlm domains and lock
resources between nodes via regular file system operations (open, close,
etc). File read and write will return and set the resource LVB for you,
currently 64 bytes. Though this can all be controlled from shell, a small
library (libo2cb) to take advantage of this is provided in the current
toolchain distribution.
