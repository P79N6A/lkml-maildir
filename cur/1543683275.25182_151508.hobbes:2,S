Uggh. There is a difference between taking the approach that some stuff
is hard to handle and gets into trouble for using MOD_INC/DEC so is
unsafe, and doing the locking from the caller, or arranging that you
know the device is quiescent in the unload path and not allowing
unloading to work properly.
I've got drivers that use MOD_INC/DEC and are technically unsafe, they
by default now don't unload and its an incentive to fix them. I'd hate
to have my box cluttering up and have to keep rebooting to test drivers
because of inept implementations however.
