fully agree,
current hardware is capable of this, and cached files means that the kernel
lock is held for a much shorter interval, because of RAM access instead of disk
access.
But can someone explain me if in Linux, the kernel can be preempted from 
RT processes, during a disk I/O , or must the disk I/O complete to
allow a rescheduling of user processes ?
It the latter is true, then I think it's very hard to do low-latency audio on
Linux.
Does anyone know (just for curiousity) how SGIs manages this ?

Benno.
