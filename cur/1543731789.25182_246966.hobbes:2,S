Hi!
I use SkyStar 2.6c DVB card. I noticed that I can't watch digital television
anymore, after 2.6.7 to 2.6.9-rc1 upgrade. First reason was change of DVB
device, but second one is little bug in kernel.
Name of device has been changed in 2.6.9-rc1 to "SkyStar2", but module stv0299
still compares name with "Technisat SkyStar2 driver", strings are different,
and result is that stv0299 detects invalid tuner type. Not only I am not able
to tune anything, but also I can crash system just by reloading DVB modules and
being in X at same time.
Following obvious patch fixes problem.
