This is a key issue on SANs as well.  I think that having the hosts'
UUID in the RAID superblock will allow rejection to happen
gracefully.  If needed, the user-land tools can have a --force
option.

I think the there needs to be two fields, a UUID field for the host
owning the RAID superblocks, and then a name field so that the host,
along with any other systems which can *view* the RAID superblock, can
know the user defined name.
