...sorry... I already apologized (for being stupid and not looking
closely enough before I posted) elsewhere in this thread, but in case you
missed that, consider this as an apologize.

Ack. I just wasn't sure all the means to fry your hardware were covered by
CAP_SYS_RAWIO and friends.

Good.

Then it would actually be feasible to use it in a lot of cases.

Ack.

It was just an idea. I'm not even sure it's waterproof - I _think_ it
could be, but I'm no guru.

For a workstation (and in certain cases, for a server as well) I generally
like to be able to load modules after reboot as well. But rootkits
nowadays include kernel modules to hide everything. If it is possible to
load this kind of stealth module (the same thing could propably be
accomplished via raw io as well, at least in theory), it not possible for
me to tell if the box has been compromised. Not even in theory. But if
loading modules and re-enabling raw io would require out-of-site private
key, there would be at least some parts in the system I could trust, even
if I'm not sure if it has been compromised.
