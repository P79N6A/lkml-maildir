No.  The values are proportional to the number of server threads, not
the amount of RAM... and they should be un-necessary after 2.4.20
anyway as nfsd in the kernel makes the appropriate settings.

My only guess is that it is doing a lot of copying into low memory
because your devices can only DMA into/outof low memory.
Have you tried 2.6 ??
How about CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G ?
It won't use all the RAM, but it would be interesting if it were
faster.
