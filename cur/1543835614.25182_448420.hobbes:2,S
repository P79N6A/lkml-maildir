Well there's a FIXME in the x86_64 code for that, anyway. (lahf/sahf
can't cause problems, so iret is the only remaining problem.)

Can that happen?  Singlestep traps happen after the instruction has
already executed.  Or are you talking about starting to singlestep
after hitting a code breakpoint fault?

The debugger needs to mask TF in the pushed flags.  Read the comment
in is_at_popf().

I only see one bug here: the REX prefixes are 'inc' instructions
in compatibility mode.  Otherwise, prefixes that are only valid in
32-bit mode are ignored in 64-bit mode.

I sort of got this working some time ago but I forget what the
problems were.  The idea was to decide whether or not a SIGSTOP was
meant for the debugger or not, and forward the unwanted ones to the
app.  But yeah, the interface really sucks and that probably can't be
made to work.
What Linux needs is a fresh new design for a debugging interface to
sit on top if utrace, one that solves the current inherent problems.
Just making a list of these problems is probably the place to start.
