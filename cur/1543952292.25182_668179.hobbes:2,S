I'm a counter-example to your suspicion :-)
Trying to control virtual address space is a complete nightmare in the
presence of anything that uses large sparsely-populated mappings
(mmaps of large files, or large sparse heaps such as the JVM uses.)
If we want to control the effect of swapping, the right way to do it
is to control disk I/O, and ensure that the swapping is accounted to
that. Or simply just not give apps much swap space.
