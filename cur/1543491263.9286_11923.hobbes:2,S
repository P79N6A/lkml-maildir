Andrea, I agree with Richard because it makes more sense to *never* allow
compiler move rdtsc around, neither allow anything before rdtsc to "pass" 
it ("pass" in Intel's sense). As for an extra version of get_cycles() I
would vote for a von_neumann_get_cycles() (or perhaps a shorter name)
which would enforce "Von Neumann execution stream", e.g. by doing CPUID
first, but one needs to measure the combined cpuid+rdtsc overhead and
deduct it from the number of cycles in between two calls. But this would
be a very specific application of rdtsc - hence the need for a new macro.
