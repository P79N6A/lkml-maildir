A while ago I told you that if you could show that the transport class
abstraction could not support both the aic94xx and LSI SAS cards then we
could look at doing SAS differently.  Since then you have asserted many
times that a transport class could not work for the aic94xx (mostly by
making inaccurate statements about what the transport class abstraction
is) but have never actually provided any evidence for your assertion.
In a recent prior email, you said:

So very soon now, with proof by code, we shall have confirmation or
negation of that assertion.  I'll wait quietly for this to happen, and I
would suggest you do the same.
