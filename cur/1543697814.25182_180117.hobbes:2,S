Ok - inserted an printk(smp_num_siblings) to have a look into 
smp_num_siblings at that point.
It says : smp_num_siblings = 2
But anyways if physical_balance is set to 1 that won´t prevent anything 
from running through/sleeping in the kernel_thread-loop.
The kernel_thread(balance_irq ...) later on will be started/will run not 
matter what physical_balance says.
Do there exist any cases where smp_siblings are created without 
HyperThreading ? (As far as I remember it´s only incremented/used on 
i386 hyperthreaded architectures - but not 100% sure)
-> At least the if has to look like :
...
if (smp_num_siblings > 2 && !cpus_empty(tm))
     physical_balance = 1;
...
(if - like in my case - smp_num_siblings == 2 on a single P4 system)
That one still does not solve the case in which the kernel_thread is not 
needed and only eats resources.
Of course - maybe the whole thing can be merged together. Not sure about 
that. But source will become more complex in that case - k.i.s.s. may be 
the better approach.
Thanks,
Kai
