No. The kernel have no idea about what POSTing means in fact. That is
also driver specific.

The driver should be able to determine that looking at the state of the
device. Things like vgacon may need some massaging, but that is not
something we need to care too much about :)

That doesn't have room in pci_dev, that only concerns a minority of HW
and I don't think we need to track it accross load/unload.

I think we need _at_least_ to make a common "stub" driver for fbdev/drm,
and if possible, only implement that in the merged driver when that
happens. We are talking about the future here. Existing users already
have X happily POST'ing their cards.

Yes, and X need to be fixed for that, this is _WRONG_, one of the
numerous x86-centric assumptions in X. Note that the fbdev driver is
currently aware that anything can happen to the card when in KD_GRAPHICS
mode (and thus, the driver loses ownership). I restore as much as I need
hopefully when coming back. So we may end up having a non-issue there.
Once we have an Xgl on top of mesa solo, the problem will not happen.
Ben.
