Then you should contact a Red Hat Linux forum for support.
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org for the most part only discusses
fairly vanilla kernels, especially the ones published at
http://kernel.org
.  Perhaps you could try loading one of
those kernels, and seeing if the problem exists there?
If it does, please write back with more info.
