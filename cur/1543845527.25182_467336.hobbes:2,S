Shouldn't this dependency be:
   depends on (ARM && ARCH_AT91) || AVR32
(The "ARCH_AT91RM9200 || ARCH_AT91SAM9261" can be replaced with
ARCH_AT91 since the driver should usable on the RM9200, SAM9261 and
SAM9260)
The help text should probably also be updated for these 3 options so
that it mentions the AVR32.
