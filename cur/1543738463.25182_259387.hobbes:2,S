It won't break anything, because even with my patches
automount will call mount by absolute path (typically
[/usr]/bin/mount).
execvp() does not use PATH in this case.
I plan to add a flag to configure to stop using abs paths.
Only if built with this flag, automount will exec plain "mount"
and use PATH.
