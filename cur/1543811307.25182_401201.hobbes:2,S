Subject: [PATCH] Convert serial_core oopses to BUG_ON
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
With reference to these two bugs:
	
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5958
	
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6131
it seems that folk are under the impression that serial_core is
responsible for these bugs.  It isn't.
Calling serial functions to flush buffers, or try to send more data
after the port has been closed or hung up is a bug in the code doing
the calling, not in the serial_core driver.
Make this explicitly obvious by adding BUG_ON()'s.
I don't particularly want to add these BUG_ON()'s since they have a
performance impact, but it seems that they're necessary to convey
sufficient understanding about where the bug lies.  The Bluetooth
problem has been around for _ages_ (longer than the entry in bugzilla)
and no one seems the least bit interested in fixing the fscking thing.
I can only hope that adding these BUG_ON()'s provides sufficient
clarity to cause people to look elsewhere.
