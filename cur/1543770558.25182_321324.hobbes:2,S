I actually when I talked to the SGI folks about 5 years ago at Usenix
I got a different story where they really were thinking about hacking
a tasklet to handle some of this IO stuff going. So I'm going to bet
that you're wrong about this based on that conversation.
The combination of this and RT apps that use it require some kind of
RT guarantees. I've had a number of conversation with SGI folks that
have stated this.
And notice your jumpy comments doesn't dillute any of the things I've
pointed out whether you understand it or not.
