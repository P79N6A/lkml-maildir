Subject: impact of Athlon's slower front-side-bus (FSB)

Gentlemen - 
Can anyone provide arguments, evidence, or guidance regarding the followng:
The fastest AMD single processor Athlon XP is 3200 with 400 Mhz FSB.
The fastest AMD dual processor Athlon MP is 2800 but with only 266 Mhz FSB.
So, for a multimedia application, which platform would be faster?  How does 
the much slower FSB of the dual processor impact its ability to grab and 
crunch.  Does its onboard cache make the slower speed FSB less important?  
Also, does a dual processor platform distribute the interrupt loading as well 
as process loading?  I my systems I have between 1 and 8 frame identical 
frame grabbers.  Would the interrupt processing of these devices be 
distributed evenly on the dual processor platforms?
