More tests...
The problem is the rt kernel AFAICT, this goes beyond Flash 9, way 
beyond:
_OpenOffice_ hangs with 2.6.21.5-rt20, works fine with stock Fedora 7 
kernel. Flash 9 hangs with 2.6.21.5-rt20, works fine with the stock Fedora 
7 kernel. Same machine booting different kernels, I'd say it is the 
kernel.
The only way out for a hung app is a reboot.
Ingo: what would be a good way to trace this? It makes the rt kernels not 
very usable at least on this hardware (more tests tomorrow in the CCRMA 
machines).
Same on 2.6.21.5-rt18 with CONFIG_NO_HZ not set.
