Greetings;
I've read through the Intel pdf doc sheets on the Intel 82c55 about 4 
times now, looking for clues, but everything about the control 
register seems to be write only.  Their logic diagrams don't even 
acknowledge the existance of the control register.
Is there anyone here who can tell me how to read the current status of 
the ctl register in an 82C55?
The std inb(ctl_address, byte); is returning 0xff regardless of what I 
write with the corresponding outb statement <10 microseconds in front 
of the read.
I hate trying to program stuff this badly blinded by what appares to 
be a hardware limitation. ):>8
