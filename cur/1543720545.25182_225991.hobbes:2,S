Nope.
GFP_DMA means "from the lower 16MB of memory".  It's needed for crufty old
eisa hardware which only does 24-bit DMA.  It's meaningless to OR this with
GFP_KERNEL.
However it's a bit odd that GFP_DMA implies !__GFP_WAIT.  It would be valid
to hunt down GFP_DMA users who should really be using GFP_DMA|__GFP_WAIT,
but this stuff is so old and crufty I'd be inclined to leave it all alone.

Your patch is wordwrapped and uses weird headers (please omit the leading
./ from the pathnames).
