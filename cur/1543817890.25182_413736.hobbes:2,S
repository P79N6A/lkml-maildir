Subject: [patch 01/26] tlclk: fix handling of device major
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
tlclk calls register_chrdev() and permits register_chrdev() to allocate the
major, but it promptly forgets what that major was.  So if there's no hardware
present you still get "telco_clock" appearing in /proc/devices and, I assume,
an oops reading /proc/devices if tlclk was a module.
Fix.
Mark, I'd suggest that that we not call register_chrdev() until _after_ we've
established that the hardware is present.
