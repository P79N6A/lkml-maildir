Yes, I think reserving some entries for second kernel will be important
to make sure second kernel can perform DMA while saving the kernel core.
We don't want to clear some entries in second kernel as some ongoing DMA
might be using it and we will run into issues.

In general, run checkpatch.pl on the patch.
is_kdump_kernel() can go in kdump specific files and exported here.
This function can be used by some other drivers too.
I think use "elfcorehdr" instead of "reset_devices" to detect the kdump
kernel. reset_devices can in general also be used for booting on a kernel
on a fauly bios which does not does a good job of resetting the devices.
Thanks
