There is. It gets rid of many tens of drivers that are not and will never
be 64bit clean and have a snowball in hell chances to work on x86-64.
In theory you could invent a new ISA_SLOT or ISA_BROKEN config for them,
but since ISA does the job quite well for near everybody except
for one or two corner cases I don't see any sense in changing it.
