Hi,
Since 2.4.19 a usb mouse does not work anymore if
CONFIG_USB_HID=m
and
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=m
is set. It only works if both are compiled into the kernel. Yes, I have set
CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT=y.
I've also seen other complaints about usb mice not working in 2.4.19, I guess 
that's the problem?
If the stuff is compiled as modules, everything seems to be fine. The kernel 
messages are the same, everything is detected fine. Except that 'cat 
/dev/input/mice' does not give any output if the driver is compiled as 
module.
Cheers,
Oliver
