 Confirmation. Booted 2.5.72 with this patch and tried swapping and switching
 cards about 50 times, and things look stable.
 Next, how to get my d-link dwl-650 wlan card up and running. If I insert it,
 link light on it lights up, and cardctl sees it in socket. However the drivers
 do not find it, and there is no interface available. This happens at least
 with 2.5.70 to .72. Anyone got suggestions where to start looking?
 Thanks.
