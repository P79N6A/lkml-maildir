in order to be able to handle large numbers of concurrent connections (open 
sockets), there are really only two ways of doing it efficiently:
  (1) single process using threads
  (2) single process, event-driven queues
with (1), you have a slightly higher overhead than a well-written (2), 
however you can scale to multiprocessor with no additional effort.
(2) will always be best, but is typically one of the hardest to code for.
>Does anyone have some hard numbers on which models can reach what levels?
i doubt it.  it depends too much on (a) cpu, (b) cpu core clock speed, (c) 
L2 cache ram size, (d) L2 cache ram speed, (e) ram speed, (f) bus speed, .....

typically cpu.
(cpu core clock speed, speed in talking to ram).
you spend a lot of time cycling thru lists of fd's.
how you do that is dependent on your design.
>I think a HOWTO on this subject might be in order :)
i'm not sure this can be covered in a HOWTO document.
don't take this the wrong way, but if you have to ask how to code something 
for efficiency in this manner, expecting to find samples in a HOWTO is 
rather much a pipe dream.
cheers,
