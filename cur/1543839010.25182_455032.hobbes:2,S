Hm, I guess that's ok for most of the timestamp applications I'm aware of 
as long as NTP won't cause the clock to stand still...
FWIW I think many other Unices provide a raw cycle counter via the POSIX 
clock routines.  I don't imagine they're NTP corrected, since at least 
on IRIX the application is expected to handle even cycle counter 
wraparound.
