I assume you are talking about using TCP_NODELAY as a socket option within the 
LDM software.  I could give that a try.
There is a lot of traffic on this node, on the order of 2000 packets in and out 
per second, so the tcpdump output will grow pretty fast.  How long a tcpdump 
would be useful, and what options would you suggest?
I should also note that my network interfaces are Intel, using the latest e1000 
driver.
