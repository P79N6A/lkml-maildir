here obviously root wasn't set to a string, but
device hdb1 is passed as in kernel setting?

this seems correct, but maybe some bug kicks in ...

the other options are obviously passed as root=
but can not be interpreted/resolved to a device
my assumption would be that you use the lilo root option
and do not pass the root= as kenel boot option ...
I would suggest to give append="root=/dev/hdb1" a try,
and/or update lilo or change to grub ...
