[ very cool stuff ]
Ingo, do you want protection against shell code injection ? Have the
kernel to assign random stack addresses to processes and they won't be
able to guess the stack pointer to place the jump. I use a very simple
trick in my code :
#define MAX_STKSHIFT 1024
struct thrunner {
	int (*proc)(void *);
	void *data;
}
static int thread_runner(void *data) {
	struct thrunner *thr = data;
	alloca(myrand(MAX_STKSHIFT));
	return thr->proc(thr->data);
}
int my_thread_create(int (*proc)(void *), void *data) {
	struct thrunner *thr;
	...
	thr->proc = proc;
	thr->data = data;
	pthread_create(..., thread_runner, thr, ... );
	...
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	mysrand();
	...
}
Same thing can be done for non threaded programs :
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	mysrand();
	alloca(myrand(MAX_STKSHIFT));
	return real_main(argc, argv);
}
Yes, there's still the possibility that an attacker get lucky ( this get
lower increasing MAX_STKSHIFT ) and yes you waste some stack space. But,
oh well, it works w/out any kernel modification and it's portable on all
systems that have alloca().
