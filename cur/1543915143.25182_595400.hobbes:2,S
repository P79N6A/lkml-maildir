yeah, this got pretty unavoidably broken when we killed the global LRU
in 2.5.early. It's odd that it took this long for someone to hit it.

Christoph's slab defragmentation code should permit us to fix this:
grab a page of buffer_heads off the slab lists, trylock the page,
strip the buffer_heads.  I think that would be a better approach
if we can get it going because it's more general.
