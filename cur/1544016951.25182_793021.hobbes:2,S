Subject: [patch 74/85] nfs: remove redundant tests on reading new pages

2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Wu Fengguang <fengguang.wu@intel.com>
commit 136221fc3219b3805c48db5da065e8e3467175d4 upstream.
aops->readpages() and its NFS helper readpage_async_filler() will only
be called to do readahead I/O for newly allocated pages. So it's not
necessary to test for the always 0 dirty/uptodate page flags.
The removal of nfs_wb_page() call also fixes a readahead bug: the NFS
readahead has been synchronous since 2.6.23, because that call will
clear PG_readahead, which is the reminder for asynchronous readahead.
More background: the PG_readahead page flag is shared with PG_reclaim,
one for read path and the other for write path. clear_page_dirty_for_io()
unconditionally clears PG_readahead to prevent possible readahead residuals,
assuming itself to be always called in the write path. However, NFS is one
and the only exception in that it _always_ calls clear_page_dirty_for_io()
in the read path, i.e. for readpages()/readpage().
