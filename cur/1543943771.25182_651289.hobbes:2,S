Hi,
I was wondering whether there is a shortcut in kbuild I can take if I 
just want to rebuild one module. Currently, I have:
make net/bridge/netfilter/ebtables.ko
the modpost stage ("MODPOST 2018 modules") does quite a lot of disk I/O, 
most of which I probably do not need anyway. Can this task be sped up?
