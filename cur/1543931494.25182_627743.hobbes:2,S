Yeah, that seems like a reasonable compromise.  Though in practice I'd 
expect the full disable decode approach to work fairly well too.  I 
mean, if we really end up failing to allocate space for the device with 
the root drive on it, there are probably bigger issues than just 
failing to get a few bytes of I/O space for it...
OTOH like Robert said, many devices really only need either MMIO or IO 
space enabled, not both, so having separate enable/disable routines for 
them makes a lot of sense.
