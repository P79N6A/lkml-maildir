Hi,
for me reiser4 seems broken since 2.6.17-mm3. During bootup of the
system i reach the initscripts, but then complains about FS problems. I
did fsck.reiser4 and even rebuild my fs with it (as was suggested by the
tool). Some errors were found and fixed, but i still cannot bring the
system up.
After the line
reiser4 panicked cowardly: reiser4[pcscd(6982)]: commit_current_atom
(fs/reiser4/txnmgr.c:1062) [zam-597]
follows a kernel panic showing that line once more.
No further data is displayed.
Are there any debug options worth setting?
Please let me know if you need more information.
kind regards
prx
