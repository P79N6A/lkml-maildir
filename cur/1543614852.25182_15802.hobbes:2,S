actually my fix seems cleaner because it puts the "clearing" in one single

yes, it can solve the metadata corruption (assuming the locking is
right, I can as well call ->truncate within writepage but it's not
obvious at all that it won't race because we don't hold the i_sem within
writepage), but the data corruption still holds. I mean, there's no
failure path to notify userspace that a certain page fault is writing
into a page over an hole, that we don't have space to later allocate on
disk. so to me it sounds like MAP_SHARED should preallocate the space of
the holes so you will know that the writes into the MAP_SHARED segments
won't be lost (current state of things will lead to silent corruption
and pinned dirty pages in ram, aka broken allocate on flush like
previously said).

Who developed that code? Can the author of the code forward port it to
2.4.18pre and post a patch to the list so we can review? thanks,
Avoiding the matadata corruption would be a good start at least for 2.4,
then we should just focus on the writepage locking that could race with the
other "create=1" get_blocks. If it doesn't race I will certainly agree
on that approch for 2.4.
