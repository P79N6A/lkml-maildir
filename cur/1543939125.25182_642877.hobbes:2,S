Subject: [PATCH 3/9] bfs: coding style cleanup in fs/bfs/bfs.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/24/382

Clean up errors found by checkpatch.pl.
Before the patch:
$ ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --file  fs/bfs/bfs.h | grep total
total: 2 errors, 0 warnings, 57 lines checked
After the patch:
$ ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --file  fs/bfs/bfs.h | grep total
total: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 57 lines checked
No functional changes introduced.
This patch was compile-tested by building the BFS driver both
as a module and as a part of the kernel proper.
