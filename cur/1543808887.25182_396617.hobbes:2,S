No, that is not necessarily correct.  Sometimes the ACPI bios can leave 
certain devices in a standby mode so they can wake the machine, but it 
does not have to, and often does not.  Thus when suspended to ram, 
typically your usb hard drive and almost allways your ide/sata/scsi 
drive will be completely powered off.

Then your motherboard keeps the bus in a lower power state such that it 
is capable of causing a wake event when state changes.  I'm also fairly 
sure that when such a wake event happens, there is no indication to the 
kernel about why it was woken up.  Because of that, and the fact that 
not all systems even support such wake modes, the kernel must reprobe 
all hardware when it wakes up, and hopefully finds the same devices that 
were there when it went to sleep.  It does this for both types of suspend.

That is not proof of anything other than the bus controller has the 
capability of generating a wake event.  As I said before, once woken up, 
the kernel must probe all hardware and if there is a new device, it will 
find it.  The hardware only detected that something changed and thus, 
generated a wake even, it did not notice exactly what that change was 
and inform the kernel.

Again, always not since the hardware doesn't actually tell the kernel 
what happend, it just wakes it up.
