Here is the next revision of the patch, against 2.2.10, removing direct
memory accesses from the framebuffer system, and the updated Cirrus
Logic fb driver.  Any and all testing and feedback is greatly
appreciated.
http://gtf.org/garzik/kernel/files/2.2.10-jg-fb-7.bz2
The framebuffer console subsystem currently uses direct de-referencing
instead of read[bwl]/write[bwl] for fb console output.  This patch
introduces readw_na(), writew_na(), readl_na(), and writel_na() to help
facilitate this.  This is necessary, as some platforms' write[bwl] do
byte swapping, and fbcon-cfb* is native endian.
NOTE: fbcon-cfb* is eventually going away in 2.3.x, so these patches
shouldn't be necessary in 2.3.x.  Until that rewrite however, it should
be straightforward to apply these patches to code in 2.3.x.
The Cirrus Logic generic fb driver has received a lot of updates, adding
support for the popular GD543x chipset, PCI and PReP support.  Kudos to
Jeff Rugen for a lot of this work.
Thanks to all those who helped out with testing earlier patches.
	Jeff
