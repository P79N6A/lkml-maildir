This is all very good news, and I have one extra piece to add to the
announcement: we just finished adding NFSv3 support for linux into
am-utils (the Berkeley automounter), based on these patches. It will
appear in the next snapshot, 6.0.4s1, to be released shortly.

One question though: what's the difference between the "nfsv2" and "nfsv3"
patches on your site? The v2 changes seem to be a superset of the v3
changes, but is that really the case?
Thanks,
Ion
