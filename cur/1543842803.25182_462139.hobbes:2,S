I created SuperIO subsystem for soekris board initially.
Later it was extended to support scx200/scx100 gpio (for w1 subsytem).
There is support for acb(i2c) bus, GPIO, and some stub for other
elements in pc8736x superIO chip.
But I was told those days (about at least 1.5 years ago) in lm_sensors 
mail list that splitting all that functionality into separated modules 
is the way to go.
As far as I recall pc8736x GPIO was added recently.
Here is one of the implementations posted to lm_sensors@:

And here is my drawing board with image of how it looks (just for pure
interest) in my mind :) :
