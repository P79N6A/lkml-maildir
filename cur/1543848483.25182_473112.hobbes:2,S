Ah -- okay.
So the locking order is (for example):
mutex_lock(&tty_mutex);
read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
task_lock(current);
Correct?

Fixed.

disassociate_ctty can call tty_vhangup which calls do tty_hangup directly.
do_tty_hangup can then set p->signal->tty = NULL, and after returning to
disassociate_ctty, the value of tty will now contain a bad pointer.  (I can
reproduce this behaviour by running the gdb testsuite with slab debug on)

The only place I need to revalidate data (AFAICT) is in 
disassociate_ctty where
I re-check to see if current->signal->tty is still valid.  Admittedly, I am
looking at a very specific failure path though.
I'll rework the patch and post later.
