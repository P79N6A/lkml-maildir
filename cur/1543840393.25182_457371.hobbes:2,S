Yes, I agree, it should be.

We have some folk who want a method to trigger emergency suspends when
batteries got low, or if you move the battery cover, etc.  These are
events which require fast reactions from the system, and coding up some
additional interface to pass such events to userland, have some daemon
running to monitor for those events, and issue a PM event is completely
overkill and, actually, unreliable.

It's both machine class and CPU specific.  I couldn't point you at
anything specific, except to say that different machines and ARM CPUs
handle it differently.
Some CPUs have "wait for interrupt" instructions, some don't.  Some
need special cache handling around this instruction, some don't.  Some
machines have a CPU capable of "wait for interrupt" but must not use it.
It's all handled by the CPU abstraction, and the machine class abstraction.
See arch_idle in include/asm-arm/arch-*/system.h as the starting point
for the "default" (== always used) idle implementations.
