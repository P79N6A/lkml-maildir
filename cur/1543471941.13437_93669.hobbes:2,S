"cc" is condition flags; "memory" is clobbered each time you write to
something that is not in the arguments. Clobbering "memory" is used to
singal gcc that it can't assume that memory is unchanged (i.e., reuse a
value in memory that just happens to be in a register), and also has the
side effect that it acts as a barrier: No reordering of instructions will
move stuff over the asm() because of the above.
