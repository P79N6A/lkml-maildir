	I "think" ( smoke again ) that the reason it is true for named
	so far is that it appears to only be a real problem on the
	UDP side.
	Experiment:
	ipchains rules:
	ipchains -F
	ipchains -A input -p 6 -s 0/0 -d 192.168.1.42 6666 -j REDIRECT 6667 -l
	ipchains -A input -p 17 -s 0/0 -d 192.168.1.42 6666 -j REDIRECT 6667 -l
	netcat:
	nc -l -p 6666	# on vc1
	nc -l -p 6667   # on vc2
	nc 192.168.1.42 6666 # on vc3
	on vc3 typed "hello"
	on vc1 got nothing
	on vc2 got "hello"
	
	on vc1 typed 'lo there'
	on vc2 got nothing
	on vc3 got nothing
	on vc2 typed 'hola' 
	on vc3 got 'hola'
	on vc1 got nothing
	killed all the netcats and attempted same proceedure with UDP
	netcat:
	on vc3 typed 'hello'
	on vc2 got 'hello'
	on vc1 got nothing
	on vc1 typed 'lo there'
	on vc2 got nothing
	on vc3 got nothing
	on vc2 typed 'hola'
	at which point I recieved an icmp udp port unreachable and
	netcat bailed.
	on vc1 got nothing
	on vc3 got nothing
	I was expecting, based on the TCP experiment that comminication, 
	that the udp communication would have worked similarly.
	I think (more smoke rises and hair starts to smolder) that based
	on the experiments there is a small bug somewhere.  Though this
	could also be perfectly acceptable behavior.  
	If someone would please clear this up for me and slap me a few
	and say "look bucko, that's normal, UDP blows, getover it"
	or something I would be much appriciated and wil consider it some
	sort of obscure feature.
