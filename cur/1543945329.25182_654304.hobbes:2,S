maybe it's worth trying linux-2.6.git instead for now? The e1000e driver is
actually involved in the dhcp handshake so we can't just rule a bug out yet.
However, with my own t60 things appear to work just fine.
how does manually getting a dhcp address go? can you eliminate networkmanager
perhaps? just kill & restart dhclient over and over again...
