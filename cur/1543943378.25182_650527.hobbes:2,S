I notice that recent KVM is incompatiable with older versions.
Using a KVM image created on 2.6.24 will crash on 2.6.25 (or
vice versa). It appears that Ubuntu Hardy has incorporated the 2.6.25
update even though it claims to be 2.6.24.
This is reproducible on Intel (64bit) kernel.  Was this intentional?
is it documented?
