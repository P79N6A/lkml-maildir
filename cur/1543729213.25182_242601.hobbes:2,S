I don't think this works with a bug so clear-cut as this one.
On the USB front it's so hard to find any users with meaningful
bug reports that I apply fixes for singular users, if they make
broader sense. How do you know that that one user you mentioned is
not a representative of countless IBM minions who clang their chains,
pull Token Ring cables and cry in their dungeons...
