Agreed. I didn't explain well enough. The assignment doesn't need
to happen until that point. My assumption was the host OS (or Hypervisor)
would already know what it's supposed to be before then and just
set it up at that point.

Ah ok.. I was assuming there was only a "Hypervisor" and all the "guests"
were equal. If one OS instance is "Host" and can see the device before hand,
then yeah, it makes sense to "hide" the device from the normal device drivers.
