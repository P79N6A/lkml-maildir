The driver reads the IRQ number from the PCI device configuration space on
linux-2.0 kernels, but is provided by the PCI driver code with this
information in linux-2.2 kernels. In both case, the IRQ number is assumed
to be the one that corresponds to the actual IRQ routing of the device on
your system. If for some obscure reason, it is not so, then the driver
interrupt routine will never be called and no IO will complete.

That's the case for all PCI device drivers. The PCI config space is 
filled in by the POST code and shall be correct. For non-intel, Linux 
is performing some write to device PCI config space and they also 
shall corresponds to the reality of the actual hardware settings.
Failing to do so, may just let your system not work at all.
