Yes. It is one of reasons why "high availability" projects based on sharing
IP addresses on single media cause no emotions from me but perplexity.
IP does not work in this way. Certainly, the experiments are interesting but
have no perspective. The base assumptions are wrong.
It has chances to work reliably only if broadcast wires are strictly
segregated at MAC level.
