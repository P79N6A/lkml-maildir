procfs needs to be mentioned in a main clause (rather than parenthesized
and in a subordinate clause), too. I don't recall if breakage happened
at 2.6.0 or some other time, this however is pretty annoying, as much as
the need to use unstable and undocumented 0.X version kernel support
libraries or daemons utilities.
One /proc example: The removal of /proc/scsi/$DRIVER/$CARD broke for
instance the 3ware Escalade 6000/7000/8000 series 3DM tools - and the
driver IS open source.
OK, in this case it doesn't hurt because the 9000 series 3DM2 tools
work, but it takes a while to figure *that* out.

It should be "2 years or next kernel minor release, whatever comes
later". I understand that to developers, keeping old gears and wheels
around is an annoyance, but knowing one is in to support this for three
years or so makes some people think twice about adding things or
changing things in incompatible ways. And making people think twice can
only improve quality.
