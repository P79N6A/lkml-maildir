IMHO integrate _please_ Andrea's patches 100%.
Dual SMP PIII550 with 1024MB memory CAS 2-2-2.
Reason: latency, <30% with Andrea.
Test: time qsbench -p 9 (Lorenzo Allegrucci):
      rc1aa1 resolves the latency in
      <30% the time with 120MB swap,
      <20% _without_ swap space present!
      time qsbench reaches 5m44.204s with rc1,
      <= 2.44.025s with rc1aa1,
      test a login in that time ..., wait Godot!
      Without swap the times are:
      <= 3m41.720s with rc1,
      <= 2m43.090s with rc1aa1.
What is better if e.g. a "qsbench" occusr,
wait 5 or 3 minutes for a response?
I run my 3xUP and 1xSMP normally _without_ swap,
all with lots of memory.
Note: this with or without 2 (two) setiathome
      24/7 on the SMP + all abitual work.
      See setiathome country Switzerland under
      Mario Vanoni, about place 87.
Kind regards
Mario, _not_ in lkml.
