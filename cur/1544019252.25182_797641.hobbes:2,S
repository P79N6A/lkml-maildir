Okay, rebased on top of the current master[1].
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tj/misc.git tj-percpu
The rebased commit ID is e7f538f3d2a6b3a0a632190a7d736730ee10909c.
There were several changes which didn't fit the rebased tree as they
really belong to other branches in the x86 tree.  I'll re-submit them
as patches against the appropriate branch.
Thanks.
