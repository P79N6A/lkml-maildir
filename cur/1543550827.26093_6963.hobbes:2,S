	No, it's incorrect and misleading. See for example
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/novelty.htm
 which states:
"In order for an invention to be patentable it must be new as defined in the
patent law, which provides that an invention cannot be patented if: "(a) the
invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or
described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the
invention thereof by the applicant for patent," or "(b) the invention was
patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country
or in public use or on sale in this country more than one year prior to the
application for patent in the United States . . .""
	The "year of protection" has nothing whatsoever to do with provisional
patent applications which are something else entirely.
