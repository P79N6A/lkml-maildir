Let's be clear, I just collect patches that I think are interesting. The
original post by Andrew Morton <akpm@digeo.com> is here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104695003008386&w=2
Quoting it:
shrinks my 3.2.1-compiled kernel text by about 64 kbytes:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3316138  574844  726816 4617798  467646 vmlinux-before
3249255  555436  727204 4531895  4526b7 vmlinux-after
mnm:/tmp> nm vmlinux-before|grep __constant_c_and_count_memset | wc
    233     699    9553
mnm:/tmp> nm vmlinux-after|grep __constant_c_and_count_memset | wc
     13      39     533
And I also remember other posts, by other author of a similar patch, that
claimed some critical functions not being inlined due to size (memcpys..).
Will try to look original info about that...
