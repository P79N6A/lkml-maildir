    Hi Ville :)

    I don't remember clearly. Maybe at linux-gazette or someplace
like that. Moreover, maybe I take the phrase out of context.

    Yes, that makes sense, obviously. My question is more: when an
inactive page will be swapped out? Only when there is no more RAM
left? When free RAM goes below some point? How to configure it?

    Except when I'm compiling something large, the memory is almost
entirely free. I have a lot of memory for having a lot of cache, so
when I develope things go real fast. For example, I use gcc, make and
binutils (and an editor) most of the time. Well, thanks to the disk
cache, the first time they are run is the only disk access...
    Moreover, sometimes I use ram disks.

    But in such a case, highs are the chances of the program crashing
due to a memory error if there is no swap. I really don't understan
why swap may save me in this case O:)) Maybe the swap-in, swap-out
will make that process slower and I have some spare CPU to be able to
kill the program?
>Hope this helps.
    Yes, thank you :))
