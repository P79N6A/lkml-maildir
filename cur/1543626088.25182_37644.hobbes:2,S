Stuff deleted...
In looking at kernel/acct.c it looks like someone tried to change acct.c
to no longer conditionally compile based on CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT.
The problem is that other files that conditionally compile with
CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT (include/linux/acct.h and others) where not changed.
So if you build with CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT not set you're build will
break.  I'm in the process of generating a patch that will make acct.c
again conditionally compile based on CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT.  This
should be done in a little bit and I'll post.
Dave, where did you get the patch for acct.c?
