In many cases i think, it's limiting one's imagination and expanding
laziness[0].
In the school algebra (usually) there are many exercises with
plain-useless equations and formulas you must solve or simplify.

[0] Now, when most UNIX tools done with good quality (courtesy of the
    GNU project), it's time not to convert programmer's laziness[1] to
    ordinary one. Why there's one big and slow Bourne again shell, yet
    to have fast ([d]ash) and tiny one took more time? As result more
    efforts to remove bashizms...
