we wanted to be able to ommit some of the parameters and let UBI use
resonable defaults if needed.
Example where we wanted to explicitly overwrite the offset parameters:
  mtd=content,1984,2048
Example where we did not want it but let instead UBI figure out
resonable parameters:
  mtd=4
With the three arrays we did not see a nice way of achieving this.
  ubimtds=content,4,7
  hdroffs=1984,?,1984
  dataoff=s2048,?,2048
The ? look odd, don't they?
We also looked at the slram parameters which are like this:
  slram=name0,addr0,+size0,name1,addr1,+size1
and found that if we wanted to add one more parameter e.g. width it
cause likely an interface change:
  slram=name0,addr0,+size0,width0,name1,addr1,+size1,width1
Finally we found that we liked the phram parameter parsing (which is
essentially the same) and did it similar to that.
