Good job =)

I find this really odd... It works just fine... 
As did disabling whats now active ie:
'Halt Disconnect and Stop Grant Disconnect' bit is enabled.
So it seems like these are the two most important factors, at least from
where i stand. Both enabled me to actually use my machine with IO-APIC.
(1, disabling Halt Disconnect and Stop Grand Disconnect bit or 2, Add a
delay on the irq ack.)
Anyone that has any clues?

Good job, i wonder if it could be more generalized and integrated with
the rest of the code (i haven't even checked the rest of the code, but
this seemed separated).
One thing though, I get a lot more NMI's now than with nmi_watchdog=2...
NMI:      85520
LOC:      85477
I usually had a 3 figure number by now... but.. =)

Cool.. 
I applied all patches and it survived my grep test so i think it works.
