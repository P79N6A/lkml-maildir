Yes, it seems like there are two choices at that point - bail, or take a
wild guess as to what you're supposed to do.  I think the mount
succeeded because no one was required to send more than 8K at once. 
IIRC A was BSD/OS 4.x, B was Linux 2.4.x.
Man, that was a weird bug.  Took me *days* to pin down, because it would
mysteriously disappear as long as you only dealt with files < 8K.  Which
as it turns out is almost all of them except the password file.
