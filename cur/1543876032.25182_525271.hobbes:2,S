Do the "C++ kernel modules" crowd actually know C++? If they knew how C++ was 
designed, they would know that it requires some runtime support, which will 
stop them from asking this question over and over again. I'm begining to 
think that most of these questions are asked by people who think OO 
programing should used in the kernel (which is already done anyway)
