There are situations where data integrity is far more important than speed.
On AIX I usually use the Mirror Write Consistency and Write Verify
options on my mirrored volumes that store data where integrity is more
important than speed.
I guess something like those options would also satisfy Lennert's
needs, but I don't know if it's currently possible with the Linux LVM
or elsewhere.
You can read a bit about the MWC and WV options in AIX at :
