I think that's not true. 'count' is changing through the iteration.
The difference in the mem_read():
* while (count > 0) {
*     int this_len, retval;
*
*      this_len = (count > PAGE_SIZE) ? PAGE_SIZE : count;
*      retval = access_process_vm(task, src, page, this_len, 0);
*
*      ...
* }
is the fact, that this_len = min(PAGE_SIZE, count) is in the
iteration block, hence retval <= this_len <= count in each iteration
step. So this is ok. But IMHO in your code 'retval' may be bigger than
'count' in the last iteration of the block, because 'max_len' is fix
through your iteration but 'count' is changing. Or am i missing
something?
