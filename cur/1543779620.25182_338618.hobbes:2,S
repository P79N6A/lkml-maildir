I've been complaining about this for some time. Kernel.org really needs
to show more information about the rc kernels and how to create them.
We want more testers, but I wonder how many people go through the above
steps and just give up when things don't work. Luckly Sean was nice
enough to email the LKML and ask.
My main gripe is that there's no link to 2.6.12 which is what most of
the other patches go against.
