I'm talking about the concept of a header file containing something like:
	#define FL_VFS		0
	#define FL_FOOFS	1
	#define FD_BARFS	2
	...
not being scalable.
Do you have a complete list of filesystem types? Are you prepared to act
as an Assigned Number authority for that list. For this kind of problem,
strings are a damn sight easier to manage in the long term.

I'm sure the api would be easy to port.  I wouldn't accept any api for
FreeBSD which involved assigning numbers to filesystem types. It was too
painful to rid it of the last set of numbers from the old mount(2) call.
