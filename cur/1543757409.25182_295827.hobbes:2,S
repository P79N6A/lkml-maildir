Looking at the code, I think Franck is right. buf is a "const unsigned 
char *" for which sizeof(buf) is the size of a pointer.
This certainly looks like a bug.
Since the function doesn't guarantee that nr bytes are written, and the 
caller must handle the case of fewer bytes, this probably went unnoticed.
