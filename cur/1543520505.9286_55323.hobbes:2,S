I'm in favor of that, and would like it to be a build option. I do understand
that some applications might user executable stack in a valid manner, (things
like matlab?) but most systems would be more secure if the stack were not
executable. Especially routers, firewalls, and dedicated file/print servers.
Where is that patch (pretty please...:)?
