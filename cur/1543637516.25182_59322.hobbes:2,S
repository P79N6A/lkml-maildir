Subject: [PATCH] Remove docgen + gen-all-syms targets
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a left-over form the docbook makefile cleanup.
The removal of docgen and gen-all-syms results in an error
when make is executed on a fresh kernel.
Remove dependencies on the above files.
Applies to Linus's BK-Latest.
