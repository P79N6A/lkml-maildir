It's not totally insane to free dcache entries from pages that won't
be freed.  It encourages new entries to be allocated in those pages.
Ideally you'd simply mark those dcache entries as prime candidates for
recycling when new entries are needed, without actually freeing them
until new entries are needed - or until their whole pages can be
released.
Also, biasing new allocations to recycle those old dcache entries, but
also biasing them to recently used pages, so that recently used
entries tend to cluster in the same pages.
(I'm not sure how those ideas would work out in practice; they're just
hand-waving).
