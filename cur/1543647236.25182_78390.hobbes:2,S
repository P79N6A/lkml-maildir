Actually, we _do_ want to have a node for each partition, if we want to
show the things that are associated with one particular partition. And we
do have those things - mounts and (onc eit's working again) LVM
relationships etc.
It's a perfectly valid question to ask "what partitions are part of this 
extended disk?" or "which partition is the backing store for this 
filesystem?".  Which implies that a partition is a real first-class 
entity, not just "one of a range".
