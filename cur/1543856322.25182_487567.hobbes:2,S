A plain text attachment should work.

Ok, but as there are other ways to get this information, can you take it
out please?

Can you just create a new device node for the second endpoint?  That way
your userspace tools don't have to toggle anything, and it might make
things for users simpler.  Just use the second device node to read from
the endpoint used for streaming.  Writing on it might not need to do
anything (or you could tie the write into the single out endpoint,
that's up to you.)
Would that work?
