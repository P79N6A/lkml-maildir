Not really, as long as filesystem _layout_ is stable.

No, you have not.  You are yet to demonstrate that it's doable.

The *SHOW* *THEM*.  You keep repeating that it's simple.  Fine, show that
it can be done.  Then we can start talking about the rest - until you can
demonstrate (as in, show the working code) that does what you call simple,
there is no point in going any further.
_That_ is the point of contention.  And no, saying the word "atom" does
not count as proof of feasibility.  Show how to map metadata between different
filesystem types.  Hell, show that you know what types of metadata are there.
Forget about in-core data structures.  Whatever data structures you use,
it boils down to manipulating on-disk ones - that's kinda the point of
exercise, right?  Show what should be done with them - with whatever in-core
objects you like.  Assuming that VFS or any other parts of kernel do not
get into your way and do not impose any restrictions - how would you do this
stuff?  From one on-disk layout to another.  In details.  Then we can go
and see how to make existing kernel objects live with that.  That will be
extra condition and it will only make the problem harder.  Until you have
a solution of easier problem, there's no sense in discussing harder one.
