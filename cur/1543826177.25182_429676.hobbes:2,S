Hi,
In the kernel tracer I develop (LTTng : 
http://ltt.polymtl.ca
), I see a need
that could be shared by others : I extensively use per-CPU data structures to
provide efficient tracing. In addition to that, I use atomic operations (cmpxchg
and atomic increment) to keep track of offsets in the buffer so it can be
reentrant with NMI handlers.
Would there be some larger interest for having non LOCK prefixed versions of
atomic.h functions and cmpxchg for per-CPU variable purposes ?
