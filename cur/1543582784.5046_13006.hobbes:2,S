I've seen IRC sessions getting dropped every 10-15 minutes as well, and
about 70% outgoing http connections (to a FreeBSD proxy) dropping in less
than 1 second. It was so bad here I had to downgrade to 2.2.18 (which fixed
all the issues, so I'm pretty sure it was kernel trouble and not network
trouble).
