Read GPL!
I can modify/create *private* and completly *non-free* code, and link to GPL,
legally. [I cannot distribute it, but kernel should not block me!]
  nvidia unfortunatly use this, to not to disclose the complete sources]
And I can use an other OSI approved license, GPL compatible,
but if it is not yet recognized by kernel? Should kernel include all free
licences strings?
