This worries me.  I'm no x86 guru, but I assume the trampoline's setting of
the TF bit will kick in right around the following 'ret'.  So the
application will stop and GDB won't be able to read the instruction at
PC.  I bet that makes it unhappy.
Shouldn't be that hard to fix this up in ptrace, though.
