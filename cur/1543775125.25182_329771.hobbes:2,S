Isn't the canonical way to use canonical to mean a name that is independent
of a particular system but set in a standard? Such a name could be generated
only if the device itself is unique. Short of network cards and
bluetooth devices you'll be short on canonical, stable names.
In other cases you have heuristics and system configuration. These are nice
to have, but have limits and problems. Firstly, they are heuristics and thus
a bit risky to use. Secondly, they sometimes need system configuration.
And this very much limits usefullness to embedded and indeed single user
systems.
What devfs and udev can do, and a static dev cannot, is names independent
of order of detection. As for ressources, it is an illusion to think that user
space means less ressources. A demon means page tables and a kernel
stack. That 12K unswappable memory in the best case.
