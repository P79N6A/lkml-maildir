Subject: ext3 truncate bug in 2.6.0?

When writing to the file, and the filesystem (ext3) is full, it
seems to block count gets wrong.
I ran an e2fsck on the fs and found no problems.  Then I mounted
it again, wrote a file until the fs was full, unmounted and ran
e2fsck again, and get this:
e2fsck 1.32 (09-Nov-2002)
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Inode 276481, i_blocks is 681584, should be 681582.  Fix<y>?
If my memory is any good, their was a simular problem in 2.4
once.
I'm testing this with 2.6.0-test11, but couldn't find anything in
the changelog for 2.6.0.
