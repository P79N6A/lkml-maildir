It's a not-that-rarely used filesystem actually :) Been in my tree for
a few monthes and it's used by pmac users either for iPod's or for
accessing the MacOS X partitions.
It's written & maintained by Roman Zippel, and the latest snapshot is
available at 
http://www.ardistech.com/hfsplus/
 but you probably want
to ask Roman if it's really the latest version before merging :)
One thing we absolutely need too is a port of Apple's fsck for HFS+,
currently, the driver will refuse to mount read/write a "dirty"
HFS+ filesystem to avoid corruption, but that means we have to reboot
MacOS to fsck it then... But that limitation shouldn't prevent merging
it.
I suppose it may be good to also merge Roman's cleanup/rewrite of
the old HFS filesytem...
Ben.
