When pppd downs the ppp0 device, unregister_netdevice() is
trying to run /sbin/hotplug in a new kernel thread.  That
thread's `files' structure is copied from pppd, but it is
NULL.  Presumably pppd's files pointer was also NULL.
Try this:

Not my area, but I don't think exec_usermodehelper() should assume
that current->files is always valid.
Al, is this correct?  If so, does daemonize() also need this test?
If not, then how did this thread get (current->files == NULL)?
