Subject: [x86 setup 02/33] hd.c: remove BIOS/CMOS queries
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: H. Peter Anvin <hpa@zytor.com>
An ST-506 disk these days is pretty much someone trying to pull ancient
data using an auxilliary controller.  Pulling data from the BIOS or CMOS
is just plain wrong, since it's likely to be the primary OS disk... and
would be user-entered data anyway.  Instead, require the user enters it
on the command line.
