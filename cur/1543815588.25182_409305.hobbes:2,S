   As Bernd said, Analog Device has a group maintaining linux for
Blackfin. Now I am the one who in charge of committing patches into
mainline, other developers may do the same thing later.  By
MAINTAINERS entry do you mean the linux-2.6/MAINTAINER? Or shall I
list maintainers name in the patch mail?

  As a DSP, Blackfin has been there for years and is somewhat popular.
But as a CPU which can run Linux, we are trying to make it popular.
Anyway a 5$ chip runs Linux and can do audio/video codec is a good toy
to play with.

   As multimedia is becoming popular in embedded world, I believe many
people would benefit from a DSP running Linux.

http://docs.blackfin.uclinux.org/
 is a good place to find documents.
In my opinion, not many CPU has such good documents site. Even a
beginner will find it as a good linux and embedded training place.

  Actually I am. Just perfer gmail than outlook web (I don't use
window$, so don't have outlook to access company mailbox).

  For this patch it is Luke Yang, then for other drivers or patches,
it would be the maintainer. All our work(software or even hardware) is
opened, our group don't do any un-GPLed software now.

  Sorry for the size, again :) But I really don't want to split it,
doesn't make much sense.

  volatile is not evil :) The only and correct usage is variables that
may be modified by hardware (such as MMR) or in a irq/signal handler.
I have checked my code.  Yes some kind of warpper may look better, we
have plan to change it, I'll send you patch for this.

    Thanks. Bug reported.  Actually that's part of the reasons we want
to get into mainline: As we keep up to latest kernel, we can get rid
of the obsolete code in time.
