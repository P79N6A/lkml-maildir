it's not really "points", but "nanoseconds you are allowed to execute on 
the CPU". And thus two processes communicating with each other quickly 
and sending around this resource does get the attention of CFS: the 
resource is gradually consumed because the two processes are running on 
the CPU while they are communicating with each other. So it all works 
out fine.
