    The "bug" is somewhere in between:
    - I used to buiild RTC as a module
    - This was fine and hwclock used /dev/rtc
    - The new Alpha changes made the module un-loadable
    (IRQ8 is in use so rtc.o refuses to work)
    - hwclock failed (but set some very strange time/date values).
    IMHO it shouldn't have used mem access to get values from the RTC chip
    --> so the new changes triggered the fault at all.
a
I understand. Now the kernel should work correctly, and hwclock
should work correctly, both with and without /dev/rtc.
So, if due to a kernel problem /dev/rtc no longer works,
and hwclock does something silly, then I am interested
in the precise commands you give (by hand or in boot scripts)
and the precise results you get.
Moreover, in the type of alpha you have.
Have you checked that you give correct options for your model alpha
(--jensen or --funky-toy etc)?
With the --debug option hwclock gives more verbose output.
