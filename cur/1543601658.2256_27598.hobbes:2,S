Subject: Replace the eepro100 driver with the e100 driver??

The e100 license appears to be compatible, and it has some nice features, like
interrupt-cooelescing that I don't think are supported in the eepro100..
I keep thinking that if everyone could get behind a single driver,
especially one with corporate support, we may have a more stable
result...
