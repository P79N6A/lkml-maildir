   If ptr_to_nodeid() is made a platform dependent function, then
   there are some platforms that can do this very efficiently (since
   the nodeid is embedded in some of the high-order address bits), and
   some for which this is complex (e.g. platforms that concatenate
   memory from each node).
I suggest to do it like this, provide the portable version unless some
"HAVE_ARCH_PTR_TO_NODEID" CCP macro is defined in which case the
architecture can make the "address bits" optimization or similar.
The is how we usually handle such things.
