So why didn't you even include a ksymoops version of the crash? Or a good
hardware description? People do try to follow it, but it's not as if I've
seen very good reports even from people who say it's obviously bad. And
others are completely unable to reproduce the problem, so..
Right now the problem is (a) lack of good data and (b) the fact that there
were very few changes between 2.2.7 (which many claim is stable) and 2.2.9
(which many claim is broken). The major changes were actually just reverts
of 2.2.8 (which _was_ badly broken due to fs) - the majority by far is
actually ARM, Sparc, PPC and alpha merges..
SMP?
MTRR enabled?
gcc version?
Quotas?
