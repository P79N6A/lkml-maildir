With rest of suspend code, which uses bytes because depending on
PAGE_SIZE is just too ugly. Notice that image size is smaller than
half of lowmem, by design, so thats okay.
In unlikely case of 8GB 32-bit laptop, either suspend image fits into
lowmem, or you are out of luck... Also notice that kernel is allowed
to use bigger image than size limit if it can not shrink image
further. Current code is equivalent with always having limit of 0.
