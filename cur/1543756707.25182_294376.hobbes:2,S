If I understand it correctly, there are several drivers that only make 
sense if they are used together. at76c651.c alone makes zero sense?
This means it would be highly appreciated to have all parts inside the 
kernel at some time in the future.
Something different:
The atmel at76c651 frontend driver is specific to the MPC823 
architecture?
In this case this dependency should be expressed in the Kconfig file 
since it then makes no sense to offer this driver on other 
architectures.
