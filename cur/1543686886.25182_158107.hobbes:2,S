I've discovered that if you try to change the name of a file in a vfat
partition only changing upper or lower case the file immediatly
disappears.
Example:
If we have the file a.txt and we want to rename it like A.txt if we use
the mv command `mv a.txt A.txt` the file a.txt (and also A.txt) are
deleted.
I hope I helped you; let me know if it's so (i'm not subscribed to the
mailing list)
