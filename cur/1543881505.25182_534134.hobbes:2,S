ah, yeah - there due to the SMP rule in SD:
       rr_interval *= 1 + ilog2(num_online_cpus());
and you have a 2-CPU system, so you get 8msec*2 == 16 msecs default 
interval. I find this a neat solution and i have talked to Con about 
this already and i'll adopt Con's idea in CFS too. Nevertheless, despite 
the settings, SD seems to be rescheduling every 6-7 msecs, while CFS 
reschedules only every 13 msecs.
Here i'm assuming that the vmstats are directly comparable: that your 
number-crunchers behave the same during the full runtime - is that 
correct? (If not then the vmstat result should be run at roughly the 
same type of "stage" of the workload, on all the schedulers.)
