I think it can.  I'm looking into right now, but first I'm updating my
logdev to the latest release.  I stripped it all out after submitting
that pi_lock patch and now I have to put it back in!   I didn't save the
updates that I added earlier, so I'm reworking things now.  The logging
definitely helps me, since that was a major factor in getting that
pi_lock patch done so quick.
