Ok... can we get Alan Stern's patch into Documentation/atomic_ops.txt
, then? I was not aware of this, and there seems to be lot of
confusion around...
Plus... I really don't think we can "just access" this as normal
pointers... due to the compiler issues Alan Cox mentioned, and due to
the ACCESS_ONCE() issue.
