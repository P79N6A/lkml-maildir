Hi Hubertus,
I just had a quick look on your semaphore code. As far as I can see you 
do no re-check of the userspace semaphore counter while going to sleep 
on your kernel semaphore. But this way you may loose synchronization 
between the kernel semaphore and the user-space semaphore counter if 
more than two processes are involved. Or did I miss some tricky form
of how you avoided this problem?
