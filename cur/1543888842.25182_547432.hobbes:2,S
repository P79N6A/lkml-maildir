As long as we're throwing out crazy unpopular ideas, try this one:
Divide struct page in two such that all the most commonly used
elements are in one piece that's nicely sized and the rest are in
another. Have two parallel arrays containing these pieces and accessor
functions around the unpopular bits.
Whether a sensible divide between popular and unpopular bits isn't
clear to me. But hey, I said it was crazy.
