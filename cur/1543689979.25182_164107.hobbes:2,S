Have you checked the code size?
That does more work and has more code than is needed, especially on
32-bit archs.  On 32-bit, jhash_3words() is much better because it
reduces to a single call to __jhash_mix(), instead of the two done by
jhash2 (only one is required for good hashing afaict).
It is probably worth adding a jhash_3longs() to jhash.h, which does
one call to __hash_mix() on 32-bit, two calls on 64-bit, and avoids
the loop in both cases.
[ Aside: For hashing individual integers, I prefer to use Thomas Wang's:
	
http://www.concentric.net/~Ttwang/tech/inthash.htm
  He mentions Jenkin's function, and derived an integer mixing function
  from correspondence with Jenkins.
  For hashing 3 words together, Jenkins' hash does seem a bit more
  compact - if you don't call __jhash_mix() multiple times that is! ]

Is there a good reason to disallow read-only waiters?
I agree with Hugh that it seems like a regression.

:)
The rest of your changes seem fine.  I particularly appreciate your
grammatical improvements to my comment :)
