It shouldn't be hard to check this.  The only thing interesting will be
deriving when you're in an interrupt context.  Thanks for the pointer.
Are there other context-sensitive rules that we could go after as well?

These reports are for an older version of the checker --- we've fixed
some bugs in the system, which should catch more of these errors.
