I'm at a complete road block here and I appreciate any help!
I'm trying to write a packet generator that generates a packet down to the
destination/src mac address of an eth frame.  However, nothing I find seems to
explain how to do this let alone if it is possible.  As example (for
familiarity), implementing a RARP client (and server).  I first create a socket:
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_PACKET, ETH_P_RARP)
After generating an entire packet (eth frame + RARP request) and sending it via
sendto, tcpdump shows that my packet was encapsulated as the data for an IP
packet.  Definitely not what I want and I suspect it is because I'm passing the
PF_INET domain (it assuming IP?).
So how would I go about implement sending a RARP request (obviously I'm doing
something wrong or assuming something wrong)?  Or more generally, how do I get
pure raw socket access?
