this could explain the lat_ctx slowdown. The 2.3.43 idle-selection changes
are trivial enough but getting idle thread selection right can be tricky.
Just getting 'good feedback' is not enough when changing the scheduler,
lat_ctx and other micro-benchmarks are important and depend on scheduling
heavily. Could you check wether your patch causes the lat_ctx slowdown
Dimitris noticed?
i believe we have two problems and they are unrelated: lat_ctx
micro-slowdown and IO performance slowdown.
