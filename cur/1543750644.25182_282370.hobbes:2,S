That reminds me of a question I've had inthe back of my head.  When you have a SMP 
system wouldn't it be possible to have:
CPU 1 (running func1)	CPU 2 (running func2)
  |			 |
  printk ("foo...");	 |
  |			printk ("bleh\n");
  printk ("finished\n);	 |
			printk ("readout from bleh\n";
Is that possible?  Especially if the process on CPU 1 slept on a semaphore or 
something similar?
Or does printk() do some tracking that I didn't see as to where in the kernel the 
strings are coming from?
