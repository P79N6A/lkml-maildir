Earlier development kernels would change the meaning of `halt' to be
`power-off' if this was enabled, to avoid the need for any change in
SysVinit.  I suppose someone decided this was a bad idea, so now
power-off must be explicitly requested by the shutdown program.  The
new SysVinit does this if the new -p flag is used (together with -f).
So it's necessary to add the -p flag to the halt/shutdown command in
the script that really shuts down the computer - typically
/etc/init.d/halt or /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt.
