Well, first, your issue is resolution, not precision.  Current
resolution on most all timers is 1/HZ.  So this should get a min.
nanosleep of 10 ms.
So, could someone explain this line from sys_nanosleep() (
kernel/timer.c):
	expire = timespec_to_jiffies(&t) + (t.tv_sec || t.tv_nsec);
It seems to me this should just be:
	expire = timespec_to_jiffies(&t)
timespec_to_jiffies(&t) seems to do all the needed resolution round up
and such.  Since || is logical, this seems to always add 1, except if
the requested value is 0.  The net result is you always get 1 extra
jiffie (unless you ask for zero, in which case you get a timer that will
expire next tick (thru the wonders of add_timer).
