>MLDv2 general query doesn't execute that code
Yes, MLDv2 general query also leave that bit unchanged. In MLDv1
compatibility mode, igmp6_timer_handler(...) uses igmp6_send(...) to
send report, it leaves that bit unchanged too. So when switching back
to MLDv2 mode, MAF_GSQUERY flag set long time ago may have effect on
the report .
>That said, I also can't see anything it would hurt
I agree with you. it hurts nothing but a report.
By the way. May I ask a question.
Do you agree my change on is_in(...)?  That is check include/exclude
count when type is MLD2_MODE_IS_INCLUDE or MLD2_MODE_IS_EXCLUDE.
(especially for MLD2_MODE_IS_EXCLUDE)
