But then you don't get to see and inspect random samplings of the
kernel, and thereby increase your general knowledge.
The false-positive of devfs_mknod gives a remarkable (if inacurate)
inside into the relationship between vfs and de-vfs :-)
Similarly searching for "umask" finds lots of matches for cpumask and
so it a steping stone into learning more about SMP infrastructure....
:-)
It's call "stratified sampling" and can be a more effective way to
sample a large body of data than put random sampling.

I certainly appreciate that permissions on an AF_UNIX socket matter,
but wondered why they were set to "sock->inode->i_mode" rather than
simply 0666.  Maybe - I thought - sock->inode->i_mode already has the
umask applied in some way, and so re-appling it was not necessary.
Where-from comes the mode that is in sock->inode->i_mode ?
