Yeah, I wasn't entirely happy about it, but it seems that suggestions
are coming in on how to do it better. :-)

Arjan suggested creating a linux/uaccess.h that includes asm/uaccess.h,
and start moving the users over since that's where the trend is moving
anyway (avoiding including asm/* from common code). futex.c would be
the first user, and could be followed by more later as a janitorial
patch. That'd mean only one addition of the common function instead of
having to add it to every arch.

Sure, for now that's good enough. Above janitorial work could be done
later, if more users get introduced.
