  #1 - Had to rebuild a RAID array 3x8G raid5 set.  mke2fs causes entire

same problem here with things like badblocks and software raid.
badblocks causes the load to go into the 20-30's, X only responds
every 5 minutes. loads of programmes dead afterwards. (afterwards is
usually when badblocks itself has run out of memory and died).
ingo's raid0145 is very useable with small raid chunk and filesystem
block sizes (eg 8kb chunk, 1024byte fs). but as i increase them i get
more and more processes dying with "out of memory" errors when i run
a bonnie benchmark on the raid device.
eg, running bonnie on a raid0145 device with 32kb raid chunk size,
and 4096byte e2fs block size is nearly guaranteed to bring my system
to it's knees, with most daemons dead afterwards.
cpu is an AMD k6 233mhz. RAM: 64MB sdram dimm. scsi is buslogic
BT-958. disks are 3 IBM u/w's and 1 quantum fast-narrow.
