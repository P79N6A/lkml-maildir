There are acpi daemon for any evetnts that needs user space attention.
I'm not sure if these events should be routed to input layer.
But, we can do that.

For my acer aspire laptop.
I added dmi entry, and keymap.
With acpi disabled, bluetooth light doesn't work
With acpi disabled + wistron module,  bluetooth light doesn't work.
With acpi enabled +  wistron module,  bluetooth light doesn't work
With acpi enabled - wistron module, bluetooth works.
From these test cases, do you still think wistron driver can help my
laptop?
Thanks,
