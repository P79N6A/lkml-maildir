As of my latest build [2.4.5-pre1] I've STILL got the tape corruption
problem. Some new facts:
(1) It happens only writing the tape (tried exchanging tapes with a
brand new Alpha Digital Tru64 box). I can read her tape, she can't read
my tape. Tried with GNU tar and gzip.
(2) I suppose it isn't fault of AIC7xxx driver (tried both new and old)
(3) Playing with block size doesn't help (even tried variable block
size)
What can I do? Can I set some kind of trace to pinpoint the problem (in
st.c, maybe?)
