Well, one of Con's patches caused a lot of idle time on volanomark.
The reason for the change was unclear. I guess either a fairness or
wakeup latency change (yes, it was a very scientific process, ahem).
Anyway, in the process of looking at the load balancing, we found
and fixed a problem (although it might now possibly over balance).
This did cure most of the idle problems.
So it could just be small changes causing things to go out of whack.
I will try to get better data after (if ever) the thing is working
nicely on the desktop.
