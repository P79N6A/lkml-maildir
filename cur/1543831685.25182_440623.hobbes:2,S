I am not familiar enough with these architectures, but I guess somebody
else is.
Are MSI working on these architectures? The MSI code in Linux seems to
be very specific so far. And CONFIG_PCI_MSI currently depends on
(X86_LOCAL_APIC && X86_IO_APIC) || IA64

I don't think it was better. I had the same loop to find the root
chipset. Only the check afterwards has been changed: instead of checking
the subordinate bus flags on the root chipset, I checks its no_msi. Both
patches applied to these architectures would fail to find the root
chipset in the while loop. They will find a bridge right under the root
chipset (or the device itself). The flags are then checked on the bridge
bus, not on the bus that is right under the root chipset.
Anyway, assuming that Linux supports MSI on any of these architectures
and that we find a root chipset that does not support MSI, how would we
blacklist it? There's no way to add a quirk if there is no pci_dev
associated to this root chipset, right?
Assuming we find a place to add some code to disable MSI
(pcibios_fixup_foo?), we would have to set a no_msi flag somewhere. It
might be good to revive the bus flags for this case. But, that's a lot
of "assuming", I'd rather know whether all this is possible first :)
Thanks,
Brice
