I suppose so.  Except vm_acct_memory() has
	#define ACCT_THRESHOLD  max(16, NR_CPUS * 2)
But if we were to perform similar tuning to percpu_counter, yes, they're
pretty similar.
Oh, and because vm_acct_memory() is counting a singleton object, it can use
DEFINE_PER_CPU rather than alloc_percpu(), so it saves on a bit of kmalloc
overhead.

Sounds sane.
