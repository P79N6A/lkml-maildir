I don't think you need to be that subtle about it, though I agree 
perfection would be nice :) The present behaviour is just to kill 
something. All I'm advocating is just swapping something out if possible 
instead. Yes by definition we probably have picked something you would 
have preferred to leave running, but the machine simply cope with 
everything being asked of it at the moment and that something got the 
short straw. At least swapped out we will get round to running it when 
we can.

Sounds like a job for priorities and sensible use of batch scheduling.
I still feel that special casing things is basically wrong. We could 
work around the specific example that the cron.daily on my test machines 
tends to cause things to be oom_killed, but it's better to fix the 
problem. What about when I try to build umlsim again -- my standard test 
case for triggering the oom killer ;)
Let's not forget that oom killing (when it works) is a last resort, 
something we do only if we have to to avoid a panic. Too often at 
present the machine just doesn't know what to do, runs around confused 
and makes things worse by shooting its own leg off. Which is pretty much 
a real-world definition of panicking*. Lets at least try to avoid 
causing permanent damage, such as killing off sshd.
