:     Odd. I have a whole bunch of transcend cards, and I've
:     never gotten this problem. Perhaps yours are rather recent?
: 
  Though these cards were purchased only in last month, the 
  manufactring date (in cid) is shown to be 3-2007. Here are the 
  entire CID fields:
  manfid:28, product_name:SDC  , serial=5332, oemid=21334, 
  month-year=3-2007, hw-fw_rev=1-0
  / # cat /sys/bus/mmc/devices/mmc0\:b368/cid
