Why don't you just separate the library from the kernel at all, making
it a similar package.  We depend on a few external, kernel-specific
packages anyway, and depending on libkconfig wouldn't make the situation
worse.  Instead people could keep their tools build one time around in
/usr/{local/,}bin (especially important with qt-monsters :)) and if
there is a change in the language Documentation/Changes would get
updated to the new required version and people had to update it,
similar to the gcc situation for a new development kernel.
