I'll note here that one thing that is _good_ about DIPC is that it allows you
to not use it. A DIPC Linux doesnt hide the true host systems underneath
in some almost impenetrable glue and do things like move your processes
around without you asking. That means you can do stuff quickly [make it
work sense] with DIPC and quickly [final performance] sense with PVM on the
same hosts.
Nobody takes away your right to be clever.
