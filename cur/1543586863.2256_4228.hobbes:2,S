I'd be glad to test any patches....In the meantime, is 
there an older patch that will work + apply relatively cleanly to 
2.2.19?

On the same cable?  I seem to get better data rates (according 
to testing with hdparm) if the newer drives are the masters.  It only
amounts to a few tenths of a MB/sec, though, so I suppose the
old drive could be the secondary master on the cable with the 
DVD-ROM.  Would this help?
Thanks for your help!
