you are not missing anything - but i found no easy way for the time 
being to get rid of the second masking.

i reorganized how redirection is being done, and i've implemented 
auto-ACK for the i8259A, to reduce IRQ handling costs. One goal was to 
avoid the masking of the interrupt line for the timer interrupt on 
i8259A - but i think i'm going to revert that, it's causing too many 
problems all around.
