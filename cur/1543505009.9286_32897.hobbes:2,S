Jos and all,
    well I have found out that this bezerko mouse behavior is
not SMP exclusive,
and it is not fixable by changing to XT-PIC or noapic,  it
just occured on my
machine and I am using XT-PIC for the mouse.
    I also recieved an email from someone that said that they
have 20 machines
both SMP and non that experience this problem.  It is not
serial or PS/2
exclusive and it can affect your keyboard.
    The current fix or workaround "if your keyboard is still
working" is to
switch to a console   Alt-Ctrl-F1 then back to X by 
Alt-Ctrl-F7
    It seems that we are getting bad data to the mouse somehow
and and when this
data gets corrupted it must be reset.  I do not think it is in
serial code cause
it effect PS/2 mice also,  it is not in the APIC code either
as it affects non
SMP machines also.
    I do not think it is hardware related, as it has hit
various hardware
systems, and it was not present on my machine under 2.0.x.
just thought you all should know that it can occur to anyone
on any machine
