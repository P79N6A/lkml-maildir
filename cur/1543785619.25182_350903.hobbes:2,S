At least in Fedora, they ship a mode 644 config file in /boot:
% ls -l /boot/config-2.6.13-1.1555_FC5
61 -rw-r--r--  1 root root 60135 Sep 14 15:55 /boot/config-2.6.13-1.1555_FC5
No need to include that in the kernel if it's right there on disk.  Even Fedora
doesn't believe in *that* much bloat. ;)
