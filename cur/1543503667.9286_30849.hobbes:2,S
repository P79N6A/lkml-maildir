I found exactly the same problem on a large-memory machine when using a
recent version of syslinux.  Older syslinux worked fine, and a
workaround on the new one was to limit memory to 512m when booting
(hardly ideal!).

It might be, but I found it was the boot loader instead.  I have never
had any such problems using lilo.
