Also, I find it disturbing that we are forcing users to have know about 
all these
magic options that have to be put on the kernel boot line. My hard drive 
on my
new laptop would only run at 1.2mbs until I found out I had to use 
combined_mode=libata
and build a new ramdisk that included ata_piix.
