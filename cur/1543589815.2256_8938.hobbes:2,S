With a little arithmetic behind the scenes and a NULL pointer to the 
struct xdev, you could have:
struct xdev_regs {
         u32 reg1;
         u32 reg2;
} *xdr = 0;
#define RTL_R32(REG) readl(cookie+(unsigned long)(&xdr->REG))
cookie = ioremap(blah, blah);
val = RTL_R32(reg2);
...and have the benefits of the R32 macro as well as the use of 
structure members.
