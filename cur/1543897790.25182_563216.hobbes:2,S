GCC doesn't guarantee you this, either.

Yes it's useful.  That's why GCC gives you __builtin_offsetof()
for this purpose.

Sure, as long as you don't care about compatibility across
compilers, what matters is what the compilers you _do_ use
actually implement.  And note that GCC doesn't guarantee
you much over what the C standard does.  Almost everything
it allows extra is just an implementation side effect.
