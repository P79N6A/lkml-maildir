If you read it closely it isn't really spaghetti code, just a fancy
way to move blocks out of line (in essence similar to the code snippets
used in WEB and similar pre processors). All out of line blocks either
jump back directly or return (with the only exception of repeat_schedule), 
not too much spaghetti if you know the conventions. 
If gcc had a way to specify "move this block out of line" it could be writen
in a more conventional way. ATM it hasn't. Any "fixes" for this style IMHO
have to start with gcc.
