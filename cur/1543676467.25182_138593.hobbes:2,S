I am somewhat confused about how much swap space you can have with a
2.4 series kernel. If I read the mkswap man page, I get the impression
that I could have up to 8x2GB of swap space for a total of 16 GB, but
reading the RedHat reference guide, it says 2GB maximum.
I presume 2.5 kernels have much higher limits?
