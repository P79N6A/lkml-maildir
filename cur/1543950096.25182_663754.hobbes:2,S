this looks like the most straightforward and most manageable approach 
proposed so far - i always thought that cpusets should boot up with some 
meaningful default set that people could play with. This would really 
push cpusets into mainstream use i believe.
Any patch i could try out, to see how well this works in practice? ;-)
