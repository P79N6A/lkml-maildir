In all fairness, the table driven approach was proposed
for processors with slow multiplies, and these would
probably also have less of a CPU clock/main memory
latency mismatch, making cache pollution perhaps less
important.
Using the tables on typical desktop processor wouldn't
make much sense, I think.
