No Lee, I don't think I've posted any traces myself. Possibly someone else?
I need to learn how to debug where time is spent by the kernel when an
xrun occurs. I haven't yet tried some brief instructions you gave me a
couple of weeks back.
Anyway, I'm now about 3 hours down the road with no xruns now that
I've turned of SMP support. Is the migration thread part of SMP
support?
Thanks,
