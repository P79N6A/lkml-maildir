in hindsight making this a config option was a mistake. Why? Because
we're not making every single patch we add to the kernel a config
option, nor should it be. Config options for drivers or expensive debug
options are fine, debug options for random patches... aren't really. To
be fair the config option was intended to be really temporary, like 1
kernel release, until it was sure there were no kinks. Oh well, there's
too many people moaning now about ndiswrapper that I fear we'll never
get rid of it.
And no I do not think a kernel with 9000 config options is still useful;
not every single trivial thing should be a config option.
