That "interpretation" is so narrow as to be unrealistic.
The kernel supports UTF-8 the same way a stage supports
rock musicians.  You confuse support with enforce, rather
like confusing tolerance with endorsement.
And it should be noted that the kernel doesn't produce file
names.  It only passes them along.

You mean enforce again.  That enhancement request has been
rejected repeatedly because such a thing would be highly
undesirable.  What might be a convenient but unnecessary
restriction today is too likely to become an unbearable
restriction tomorrow.  I don't want the kernel to have to
care about what is or isn't valid UTF-8.  I certainly don't
want to have the kernel loaded with outdated character
tables.

I want an environment where applications can feed bytestreams
and expect the same bytestream in return.  I see enough
problems as a result of filesystems that don't do that.

You mean enforces again.  Kernel as police, next thing you
will want is a kernel that prevents undesirable character
sequences.

I'll tell you what.  Patch libc.  You can add UTF-8 filename
enforcement to libc.  There are only a few system calls that
would need to have their wrappers enlarged.  I'm sure the
libc people will direct you to someplace very warm if you
ask them for this enhancement.
