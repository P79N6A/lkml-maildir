My gateway started to give me this errors on eth0 some days ago. Eth0 is
the internal network-card, which is connected to just one pc through a
crossed tp-cable. When I run a certain app on my pc (xMule), the gateway
alway starts spitting those messages.
Could have been hardware, but only happens when xmule is active on my
computer. Wasn't like this earlier.
