Do you have model numbers on the printers?
I'm just wondering...is it a networked printer?  You may try that...
If something is being done wrong with the port, the printer should 
just stop accepting data...I assume "illegal instruction" is a kernel
panic?
I've also seen the recommendation of "using write to file" from a NT driver,
then looking at the generated output...remember, it is not IDENTICAL to what
comes out of a driver speaking to a device (if the "write to file" makes the
problem occur, great, but not necessarily...)
(BTW, I work for xerox (on the docucentre printers)) [I did the LPD, netbios,
port9100,
and lots of the parallel code].
