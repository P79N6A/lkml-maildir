Make clean is nice to have for a couple of occations:
1. Before making a tar.bz2 of the tree as a backup.  Why 
   waste space on .o files?
   A backup is useful for a number of reasons, such as
   before testing a mix of patches that might
   interferre badly.  Or even patches for another version. 
   Getting the tree again takes time.
2. The pc hardware clock screwed up again and timestamps
   are spread all over past and future :-(  Make clean time.
