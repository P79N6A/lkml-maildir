So, if there is a function
void foo_locked(struct bar *obj)
{
    /* check that we are called with obj's lock held */
    BUG_ON(!rwlock_is_locked(&obj->lock));
    /* proceed with obj. */
}
it should now be changed to the
void foo_locked(struct bar *obj)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
    BUG_ON(!rwlock_is_locked(&obj->lock));
#endif
    /* proceed with obj. */
}
