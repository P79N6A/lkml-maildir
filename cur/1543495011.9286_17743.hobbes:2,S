Remember, we're talking about different OS's here; not Alpha Linux, which
just inherited the higher clock rate.  At the time of the MIPS port,
Linux wasn't even yet a gleam in Linus' eye, for example.
Also, you may very well NOT be idle; it is feel under load, not interactive
feel on an unloaded system.
I think the real reasoning was:
	1) didn't take enough CPU time to be measurable
	2) had a number of advantages (per previous discussion; better 
	profiling and performance data, better network performance, possibly
	better latencies on process wakeups, etc.)
	3) for the operating systems of the day, it didn't seem to introduce
	performance problems. If it did, they've long since been detected
	and fixed.
	4) we were scaling up CPU speeds by 10-100-1000 times; while things
	seldom need to scale linearly, our intuition was that the clock
	tick rate should scale up at least to some degree.
Again, this is history of 7 and 10 years ago.  and some of the reasons
then may be moot now.
I think rehashing the history any more is futile; a more serious discussion
about whether there are any advantages for Linux to up its HZ rate for
the kernel would have merit.
