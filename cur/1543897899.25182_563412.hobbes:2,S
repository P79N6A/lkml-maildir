Modification, yes. Execution, well, if the rules of a jurisdiction are
insane, you will get insane results from almost any contract.
Fortunately, the GPL makes it clear that execution is unrestricted for GPL'd
works, but does not style this as a GPL right. One would hope that
jurisidictions that have such strange rules would interpret the GPL to
effect the same result under their laws as was intended under the laws the
GPL was written with respect to, to the extent possible.
Treating ordinary use as a copyright privilege leads to nonsensical results
no matter what you do. For example, you get that I can drop copies of my
poem from an airplane and then sue anyone who reads it.
