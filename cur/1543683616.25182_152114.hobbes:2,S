Hello!
My touchpad stops working with 2.5.74.
With 2.6.0test2 I got minimal success:
If I attach an external ps2mouse while booting, I can use this one.
Until I remove it, soon the kernel (psmouse I think) tries to init
the touchpad which fails.
My questions:
   1) why are you implementing drivers in the kernel?
   2) what source of information do you use to program them?
   3) how can I read /dev/misc/psaux in Linux 2.6 ?
   3.1) howto get gpm running?
   3.2) is the patch mentioned for X implemented in X cvs?
Nico
