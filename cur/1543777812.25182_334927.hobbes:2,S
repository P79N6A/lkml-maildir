I'm using the i_size of directories in my patches. When reading from a 
union directory, I'm using the i_size to seek to the right offset in the 
union stack. Therefore I need values of dirent->d_off which are smaller 
than the i_size of the directory.
Altogether, it doesn't make sense to me to seek to an offset which is 
greater than the i_size and let the dirent read succeed.
