More likely your set up was faulty

I'm very happy with my MPX based board. The docs sucked, the BIOS
socked, the lack of onboard USB sucked, but the rest is very nice and it
seems stable enough.
Power (430W PSU or bigger - and the right ones to get sufficient current
on low voltage lines) and heat are big problems. I'm very happy with
mine as a server box. As a desktop, or living in the same room as me I'd
say definitely not.
As to the lack of SCSI. I have an Adaptec/Dell Obsidian 4 port 64bit PCI
SCSI controller plugged into it. It outperforms onboard scsi controllers
so I don't feel the need for an onboard scsi controller to chain CD-ROMS
too.
