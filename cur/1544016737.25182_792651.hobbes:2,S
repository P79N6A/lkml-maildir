True. That could probably happen.

I agree. The best solution would probably be one that does not depend on
the REC bit.
I did some quick tests and modified macb_poll() so that it calls
macb_rx() before anything else is checked. When macb_rx() returns the
poll routine checks if the BNA bit was set in RSR. If that is the case
and macb_rx() was not able to process any complete frames we flush the
whole ring. In the case were we manage to process at least one frame and
BNA is set we just clear the bit without flushing the ring since the
processed frame(s) will leave one or more empty slots in the ring. 
I also had to modify macb_rx() slightly since we, after a buffer flush,
might receive an EOF fragment before any SOF frags are received (the
case were we received the SOF and then flushed the buffer). 
In order to test this quickly I changed the size of the RX ring to 16
slots since it is quite hard to reproduce the BNA issue using the
standard size of 512.
I have been testing (by constant bi-directional transfer) for an hour or
so and the driver always seems recover after BNA. Anyway, I think the
BNA part of this patch needs some more review and testing before even
thinking about sending it upstream.

Are you sure rx_tail needs updating? If I understand the specs correctly
the EMAC module will continue writing to the address currently stored in
RBQP. This address should be the same as before the flush (if no new
fragments has been recvd). Right?
