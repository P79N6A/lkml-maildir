i have upgraded the BIOS using their 'update kit'.  i'm fairly
certain that the 486-compile model + FPU emulation still did not boot
on the Nx586.  IIRC this is due to the WP bit not being honored.  this
is perhaps a post-1.x change to the 486 option.
if i get the time i'll try again, but i'm pretty sure i checked this
before writing up the patch.
