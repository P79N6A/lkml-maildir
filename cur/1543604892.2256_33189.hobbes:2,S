No.  It is unsupportable with NFSv2.
The NFSv3 protocol does provide support, the I don't think the Linux
NFSv3 client supports it yet because the VFS layer tries to handle all
the exclusion, and doesn't give the file-system a chance.

   Instead of creating a lock file, create a lock symlink.
   Have the content of the symlink be something recognisably unique.
   e.g. hostname.pid
   If the "symlink" syscall succeeds, you have got the lock.
   If it fails, issue a readlink and see if the content is what you
   tried to create (RPC packet loss and retransmit could have caused
   an incorrect failure return).  If it is, you have the lock.
   If not, you don't.
   Similar tricks can be done with hard links if you really want a
   file.
   i.e. create a file with a unique name and then hard-link it to the
   lock-file-name.  On apparent failure, check the inode number.
   With all these approaches (including O_EXCL) the tricky bit is
   cleaning up after a failed application left a lockfile lying
   around.
   Automatically deleting it is racy unless you guarantee that only
   one process could ever consider deleting an old lock file.  e.g. a
   cron job on the fileserver that runs every 5 minutes and deletes
   any lock file older that 10 minutes.
