Hello,
I can't manage to get my sound cards (SB VIBRA and SB AWE 32) working
on the latest kernels (> 2.6.14 approximately).
They doesn't even work if i use an older .config from a 2.6.12 kernel
in which they worked. That's the weird thing.
These are the relevant lines on dmesg:
Activating ISA DMA hang workarounds.
isapnp: Scanning for PnP cards...
pnp: SB audio device quirk - increasing port range
pnp: AWE32 quirk - adding two ports
pnp: SB audio device quirk - increasing port range
isapnp: Card 'Creative SB AWE32 PnP'
isapnp: Card 'Creative ViBRA16C PnP'
isapnp: 2 Plug & Play cards detected total
sb: Init: Starting Probe...
sb: PnP: Found Card Named = "Creative SB AWE32 PnP", Card PnP id = CTL0042, Devi
ce PnP id = CTL0031
sb: PnP:      Detected at: io=0x0, irq=-1, dma=-1, dma16=-1
sb: ports busy.
sb: PnP: Found Card Named = "Creative ViBRA16C PnP", Card PnP id = CTL0070, Devi
ce PnP id = CTL0001
sb: PnP:      Detected at: io=0x0, irq=-1, dma=-1, dma16=-1
sb: ports busy.
sb: Init: Done
(Note that when they worked, the irq and dma were not -1).
Is there any fix around? :?
Thanks.
