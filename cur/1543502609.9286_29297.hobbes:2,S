    My problem reolves around my STT8000N SCSI, Travan-4 tape
    drive. When I attempt to run a backup (regular tar, with or without
    compression), at a varialbe point, the tape backup fails. The kernel
    proceeds to try to reset the SCSI device, which fails, aborts, and then
    panics, puking up most of my filesystem with it. Needless to say, this
    annoys me. 
    The tape drive is connected to an Adaptec 1542CP SCSI card, along with a
    Seagate ST31230N hard drive (1Gb). The system doesn't give me any
    problems, as long as I'm not accessing the tape.
Hmm. Sounds familiar. The new SCSI error handling will try
to correct errors until either it has corrected the error,
or it has crashed the system. Unfortunately I have never seen
the former case.
Last year I polished aha1542.c a bit for someone who had troubles
with a bad CDROM - sufficiently so that his system would survive.
Have no experience with tape.
You might try this polished aha1542.c - it is various places,
e.g. at 
ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/aeb
 or so. I think its behaviour
is never worse and sometimes better but usually the same
as that of the old driver.
I would be interested in trying to improve things until they worked.
