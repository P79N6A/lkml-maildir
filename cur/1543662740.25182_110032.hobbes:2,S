The intention of Trusted Extended Attributes is for processes that 
perform tasks that are relevant for the proper functioning of the 
system, to allow them to use EAs. Other, non-privileged processes shall 
have no access whatsoever to those EAs. This level of protection would 
otherwise only be possible by providing a kernel module. 
I would be quite happy with a new CAP_TRUSTED_PROCESS or whatever, but 
going that route for all sorts of applications then we might soon end 
up with an large number of capabilities. Maybe I'm wrong on that, 
though.
Cheers,
Andreas.
