Ok,
Hum, the "whole lot" : including or excluding
- instrumentation
- the LTTng tracer ?
I realise that you have a lot of other things on your mind. One of my
goals would be to get LTTng in the -mm tree so it could help you resolve
these bugs. But on the other hand, I don't want to rush things. The
LTTng tracer could benefit of another round of RFC before it is ready
for prime time, but it would definitely be useful as-is in the mm tree.
