Even though Al suggestion did indeed fix the race and was incredibility 
simple (adding two lines of code), it turns out calling deactivate_super()
from the rpciod kernel daemon is not good, since it can cause deadlocks 
with other async tasks.
Following a suggestion from Trond, I decided to go back to the original idea 
of using put_super, but keeping all the changes inside the NFS client code.
So the following patch adds an active/deactive mechanism to the 
nfs_server structure (very similar to the s_active/deactivate_super()
mechanism) that any async opt (in this case silly renames) can use
to stop unmount for occurring before they are finished. 
This means there is no need to expose any spin locks, no need for an
O(n2) search and all the changes are contained inside the 
NFS client code.

[Note: I did make the proposed corrections to my email client, so 
hopefully space-stuffing will be fixed. ]
Author: Steve Dickson <steved@redhat.com>
    Added an active/deactive mechanism to the nfs_server structure
    allowing async operations to hold off umount until the
    operations are done.
