Ok, so I now ran the machine over the weekend w/o the patch so no
hddtemp/hddparm (and no smartd also). None of the problems above
appeared, but instead 
ata2: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
ata2: error=0x0c { DriveStatusError }
occassionally (i.e. 9 times when transferring ~400 GB from/to the disk).
This is vanilla 2.6.12... Is this error problematic ? What is causing
this ?
Any ideas ?
Thanks,
Soeren.
