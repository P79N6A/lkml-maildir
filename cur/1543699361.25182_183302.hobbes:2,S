more processes can be optimized even better by adding unfariness.
Either ways a significant slowdown of qsbench probably means worse core
VM, at least if compared with 2.4 that isn't adding huge unfariness just
to optimize qsbench.

you're confusing rmap with core vm. rmap in no way can be defined as the
core vm, rmap is just a method used by the core vm to find some
information more efficiently at the expenses of all the fast paths
that now have to do the rmap bookkeeping.
