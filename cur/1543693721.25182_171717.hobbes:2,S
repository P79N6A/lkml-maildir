Large modern gate arrays use encrypted bitstreams, and even when not
encrypted are very hard to reverse engineer, so that's not the
problem.  It's possible, but very expensive.
Small gate arrays use non-volatile programming anyway.
The problem is blatant copying of the bitstream.
This is trivial whether it's in ROM or not, for anyone capable of
making a device, so gate-array firmware is *no excuse* for keeping the
driver code obscured, not even a _5 excuse.
