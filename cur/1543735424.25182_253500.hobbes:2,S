Has anyone tried an MSI capable device in 2.6.9-rc2-mm1? When intializing my
MSI capable controller I get a return value of zero from pci_enable_msi but
the system hangs at that point as if I'm not getting the MSI vector.
Just started looking at this, but I was wondering if anyone else has seen this?
BTW: I also see a console message "MSI INIT SUCCESS" before the hang.
Thanks,
mikem
