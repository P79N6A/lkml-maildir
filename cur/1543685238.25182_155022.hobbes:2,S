Subject: Kernel Panic on 2.6 and Dual AMD Athlon MP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I downloaded 2.6.0-test2 to see if I could get it running on my dual
Athlon MP box (which runs 2.4 series just wonderfully).  I have a Tyan
S2466 motherboard which runs the AMD 760 MPX chipset.  2.6.0-test2
compiles just fine, but when I go to run it, I get the output detailed
in the attachment kp-2.6 to this message. Please note, I had to copy
this by hand since I couldn't get any serial output from the machine. 
In short, I get a machine check execption and the kernel panics saying
the CPU context is corrupt.
So I got the neat little parsemce program by Dave Jones and the output
from that is in the attachment mce-output also attached to this message.
(If they don't come through correctly, let me know and I can forward
them to the necessary people.)
I need someone to help me to understand why this is happening with the
2.6 kernel.  And what direction I might be able to take to try to get
the 2.6 kernel to run. Also, I had previously tried 2.5.70 and this
didn't happen.
