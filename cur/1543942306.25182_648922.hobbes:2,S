I had some minor additional questions, but in general, I second that
this driver should be merged for 2.6.25.
The question of the PCMCIA maintainership came up on a different mailing
list. Personally I think that PCMCIA is a dead technology, but in some
industrial environments this will live longer than expected. I would
simply propose that LKML is used for PCMCIA related review and -mm for
testing.
