Well that's just fine - anyone care to tell me how to do that :-) I've
never been in this sort of position before...

Well yes. I've thanked them - but I'd also like to see them get some
community recognition. I see this as an important step...

I don't think it'd be wise to go down that path; I didn't even manage to
get a datasheet out of them (which is how this all started). They've sent
me the code, they've given permission to release it under the GPL - let's
just get on with disseminating it.
So - how to I submit it?
Vic.
