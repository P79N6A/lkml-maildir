Same problem here, it won't run at all on newer kernels. But it isn't even 
100% stable in 2.2.x here - on very high network traffic the card stops 
working. In this case, it helps to pull the network plug for a short time, 
then everything goes back to normal. I reduced speed to 10MB, and now it is 
stable at least in 2.2.x. 
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I even put the card into 
another pci slot with exactly zero effect.
There are drivers on smc.com, but they won't help either :-(
