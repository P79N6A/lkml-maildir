This, if I remember correctly, is the trick. For some reason, NT's boot code
barfs after LILO calls it if the MBR isn't NT's. So install LILO on the
superblock of your ext2 partition and mark it as the active partition. So the
NT mbr invokes LILO, which can load Linux or the NT boot code as necessary.
I heard rumours this behaviour might have changed in one of the recent Service
Packs (I'm on NT4SP3 I think).
