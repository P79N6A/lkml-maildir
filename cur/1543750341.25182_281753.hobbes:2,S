Hi,
  I intercepted a few system calls pertaining to file
operations like open,close,pipe etc. Now, I
implemented this stuff in a loadable kernel module. I
am collecting some data from it like which process
currently access a pipe,file etc. I have displayed
them using printk. 
  Now, I want to store them in a table. But I want
this operation to be started right after the initial
booting phase itself part of the loading kernel
itself. What should I do to add my module into the
already compiled kernel image just like a standard
kernel module?
Thanks,
selva
