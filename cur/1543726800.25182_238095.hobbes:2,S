No, it won't. It will fail on the new/upcomming CPUs with 1Ghz HyperTransport. 
The minimum frequency cannot be lower than the HyperTransport speed.
And for others sometimes laptop batteries are not designed to support
more than 800Mhz.
Overall hardcoding such tables is imho a bad idea, unless you
*really* know what you're doing.
