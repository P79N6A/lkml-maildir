This is designed to work regardless.
/dev/hdc == ide-cd builtin
insmod ide-scsi
ide_ioctl(fd, HDIO_SET_IDE_SCSI, bool)
converts /dev/hdc == ide-cd builtin to ide-scsi(add-in-module).

See above, I think it solves the problem.
Once ide-scsi is added to the ide_module link list it is as good as
built-in.

Me too, because I do not know the direction goal so I am doing the very
best I can.  What I really need is an active development team.
Before me:
Mark Lord, Gadi Oxman, Eric Anderson worked well.
ML ide-disk and ide.c global.
GO ide-floppy, ide-tape, ide-scsi
EA ide-cd
Anyways that was long before transport layer w/ all the hardware issues
began to dominate things.
