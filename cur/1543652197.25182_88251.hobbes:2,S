To use kmapped memory I need to setup a page table to do the final copy.
And to setup a page table I need to know where the memory is going to be copied
to.
So my gut impression at least says an interface that ignores where
the image wants to live just adds complexity in other places, and
makes for an interface that is hard to maintain long term, because
you depend on a lot of kernel implementation details, which are likely
to change in arbitrary ways.
