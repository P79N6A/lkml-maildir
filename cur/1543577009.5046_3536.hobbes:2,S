Hello,
  After some crashes this weekend I have tracked the crash to someplace
in 
tagged Command Queue.
I noticed 2.4.0 is in the prerelease phase So I will try to get a patch
out 
real soon now the when the 39160 is detected the driver will shut off
the TCQ.
At least then 2.4.0 will be stable, not fast, but stable :)
Now back to figureing out whats wrong in that thar code :)
Leslie Donaldson
P.S. If anyone has XFree 4.0.2 working on the Alpha drop me a line. I
snagged the
     latest RPM from rawhide but it can't load symbols .... sigh...
