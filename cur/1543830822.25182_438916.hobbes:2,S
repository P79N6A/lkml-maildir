That's fine, although we should then change the SELinux exports as well
to be consistent (and convert them all to secid rather than sid or
ctxid, and eliminate duplication there that has crept in).  That can be
done by later patch.

Not sure how one would split them - they are logically all one change
(change interface and all callers, propagating up the call chain).  The
original split up was just for review purposes, by subsystem.  We can
submit it as a single patch if that is preferable.
