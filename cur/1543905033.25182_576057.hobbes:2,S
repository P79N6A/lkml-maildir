Im not saying its perfect, not at all, neither am i saying CFS is bad,
surely CFS is much better than the old one, and i agree with what that
university test you mentioned on kerneltrap says, that CFS and SD is
basically impossible to feel difference in, EXCEPT for 3d under load,
where CFS simply can not compete with SD, theres no but, this is how it
has acted on every system ive tested, and YES, others reported it too,
whether you choose to see it or not. and others people who run games on
linux tells me the exact same thing, and i have had quite a few people
try this.

And whats the point here? If you are trying to pull the old "Con just
runs away", forget it, its a certainty that he would have put the
required time into fixing whatever issues arise.

First off, i've personally run tests on many more machines than my own,
i've had lots of people try on their machines, and i've seen totally
unrelated posts to lkml, plus i've seen the experiences people are
writing about on IRC. Frankly, im not just thinking of myself.

As i recall, there was only 1 persons reports that were attacked, and
that was because the person repeatedly reported the EXPECTED behavior as
broken, simply because it was FAIRLY allocating the cpu time, and this
did not meet with the dudes expectations. And it was after multiple
mails he was "attacked"

You may not have been able to trust Con, but thats because you havent
taken the time to actually really see whats been going on, if you just
read the threads for SD you'd realize that he was more than willing to
maintain it, after all, why do you think he wrote and submitted it? you
think he just wrote it to piss you off by having it merged and leave?

as explained earlier, its not just my particular setup, but actually
that of alot of people, with lots of different hardware.

Okay, i wasnt going to ask, but ill do it anyway, did you even read the
threads about SD? Con was extremely polite to everyone, and he did work
with a multitude of people, you seem to be totally deadlocked into the
ONE incident with a person that was unhappy with SD, simply for being a
fair scheduler.
