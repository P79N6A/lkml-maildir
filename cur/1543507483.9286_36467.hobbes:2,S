2.3.15 crashes early during boot on my 486DX2/66, ALi PCI chipset board.
Without serial console support it crashed with so many oopses scrolling so
fast that I couldn't extract any useful info from it.
With serial console support and the serial console and tty0 console
activated, it rebooted without oops just after printing
the 256 ptys message.
2.3.15 was the first 2.3.x kernel I tried on that machine,
so I don't know when it broke...
