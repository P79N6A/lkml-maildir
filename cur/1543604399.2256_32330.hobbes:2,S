That was a bug in the 2.2.17 kernel, fixed in 2.2.19. The
message was bogus.
As for your 2.4 problem, from the driver messages it's pretty
clear that it can't talk at all to the chipset. I'm not sure
what the problem is, but I seriously doubt it's a driver issue.
The PCI code is a much more likely suspect.
