Soundcards are a good example of where you don't want to do this for the
high end. For the low end you can use rtlinux and a parallel port DAC just

A $30 PCI sound card can generally mix about 64 channels including effects
like reverb and digital delay, output them to 6 position or more encoded
surround sound etc.
