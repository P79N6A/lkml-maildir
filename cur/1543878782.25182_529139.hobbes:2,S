I am scrambling for my timed boot logs.  All I am finding right now
are boots from 512p machines.  For that machine, it took 178 seconds
to get to mounting the root filesystem and 75 seconds to get to the
login prompt.  Of that 75 seconds, 24 was because an NFS server was
down and 14 was due to PBS taking time to start.

Those are the long standouts.  There are quite a few lines in the boot
output which take 2 seconds or less, but none of those are too surprising.
Plain and simply, booting that large of a machine has always taken
considerable time.  The first time we booted a 512p, it took nearly an
hour, now that is down to 8 or 9 minutes.

Not fsck'ing filesystems (xfs).  One of the NFS servers that was specified
in /etc/fstab was missing, but that is unimportant.
Thanks,
