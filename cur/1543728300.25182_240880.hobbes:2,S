Hi!

swsusp will then resume disk and write the image, that should not be a
problem. Is it guaranteed that after generic_scsi_suspend() no DMA is
going on?
Anyway, you should try swsusp, preferably on some IDE notebook first
and prefereably -mm one, to get feel how it works. It should be
possible/easy to make it work with SCSI...

Looks good to me.
