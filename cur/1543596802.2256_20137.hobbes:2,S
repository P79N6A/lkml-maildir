Apologies if this is a repeat; my previous attempt to send this bounced.
I'm running 2.4.6 with the latest ext3 patch on an Expo 8kta3 motherboard
with an Athlon Thunderbird 1200MHz CPU.  My kernel is compiled with the
CPU type set to "Athlon" but the 3DNOW line in arch/i386/config.in is
commented out.  The compiler used was egcs-1.1.2.
For the past several weeks, I have been experiencing occasional oopses,
but only when running mplayer (
http://192.190.173.45/homepage/news.html
),
and even with vanilla 2.4.5 and 2.4.6 kernels.  I've run the player with
3dnow code disabled, but I still got oopses.
Below is the latest oops run through ksymoops.  I've tried several things
to try to alleviate the problem to no avail:
- Increased the core voltage of the CPU.
- Loaded the fail-safe defaults in the BIOS.
- Ran memtest86 with no problems found.
- Checked the CPU and case temperature from the BIOS and they were well
  within limits.  (But I understand that this is an inaccurate way to
  gauge the temperature.)
Thanks for any advice you can offer.
P.S. This is the first time I remember seeing the oops occur in process
sh; usually it showed the errant process as gnome-terminal.
