No, this is wrong.  I did remove it not Alan Cox and I removed it because
kernel 2.5/2.6 should not behave differently whether devfs is used or

Just removing this makes the code even more incorrect.  You need to
add a ->owner member and call try_module_get on it before calling into
the module (and handle the return value..)
