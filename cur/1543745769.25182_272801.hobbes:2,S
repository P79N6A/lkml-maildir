Oh yes, I just meant that the only way split counters will relieve
the atomic ops and bouncing is by having them per-cpu. But you knew
that :)

Well yeah, but a. their patch isn't in 2.6 (or 2.4), and b. anon_rss
means another atomic op. While this doesn't immediately make it a
showstopper, it is gradually slowing down the single threaded page
fault path too, which is bad.

1024 CPUs * 64 byte cachelines == 64K, no? Well I'm sure they probably
don't even care about 64K on their large machines, but...
On i386 this would be maybe 32 * 128 byte == 4K per task for distro
kernels. Not so good.
