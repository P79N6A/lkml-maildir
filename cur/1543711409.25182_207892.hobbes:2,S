Yes ;-) One goal of the 2.6 patches is to make it possible for higher
levels to easily insert flushes when needed.  The reiserfs fsync and
ext3 fsync code will both do this.
I realized I wasn't clear about device mapper and md earlier, both need
extra work to aggregate the flushes down to the drives.  They don't yet
support flushing.
