no, I tinkered a lot with my server (freeing up memory), which obviously
helped somewhat and increased socket buffers to 256k max., makeing i/o
more chunky and thus more efficient. i also use more than one reader
thread: under linus' kernels more than one thread made the situation
worse, on the ac kernels they seem to slightly improve throughout, up to a
point.

well, linux-2.4 has a lot of dark corners that need improving, but the
machine does no longer totally misbehave (4 or 5 mb/s is debatable, but
2mb/s with more memory and higher load is not ;). it's now acceptable to
me ;)
