I think the real goal is that 99% of users never really see this
in the first place.  Add in support for these features now with the
most permissive COMPAT flag possible, and chances are that most
normal users won't use these features for a few years.  Most of
them are for the 1% of systems that are pushing the current filesystem
limits, and the majority of these users are also more sophisticated.
You won't have Joe Average dual-booting their Linux system with a
16TB filesystem.

NB - my reference for i_blocks was the use of i_frag|i_fsize for use
     by files > 2TB, not the recent proposal for i_blocks in fs blocksize.

I think most cases where someone is ro-mounting their filesystem is
when they need emergency access to the filesystem with an older kernel.
Allowing that access IMHO is more important than exact correctness.
I'm also not aware of any tools that depend on i_blocks being correct,
though I suspect e.g. "cp --sparse" will use a discrepency in
i_size vs (i_blocks >> 9) to determine sparseness.

What happens to existing filesystems with large inodes that don't have
enough space for the extra timestamps in the first place?  Also, if files
are created while the filesystem is mounted without usecond timestamps
they would get no usecond fields anyways.  I agree that there are some
unlikely corner conditions that might be hit (large inode filesystem, on
older kernel without usec support, fills both the in-inode and external
block so much that there isn't 12 bytes left for the usecond timestamps,
and that file happens to depend on the exact accuracy of the timestamp).
IMHO the inconvenience of the ROCOMPAT outweighs the benefits.
We have previously restricted ROCOMPAT and INCOMPAT flags for changes
that would cause corruption or crashes on older kernels.  In the end,
I'm not dead-set against making it ROCOMPAT, just trying to maintain
the maximal compatibility possible.

I'm not against large block support (in fact I was hoping this would be
standard by now), or fragment support.  Rather, I think that nobody
cares enough about it to actually implement it, and given the growth
of disks the demand will never materialize, just like ext2 filesystem
compression missed the window when the benefits outweighed the costs.
If and when large-page/block support makes it into a commodity CPU
(sadly, x86_64 missed the mark) or kernel we can re-evaluate it then.
Cheers, Andreas
