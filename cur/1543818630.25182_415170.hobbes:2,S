There is none:
The kernel has _many_ people holding a copyright on part of the kernel, 
and there's no ultimate authority except for the COPYING file shipped 
with the kernel sources.
The GPL is just a licence, and if you distribute your product to N 
countries, this means you can potentially be sued in N countries based 
on N different copyright laws.
There are things that are clear. E.g. if you'd have read the COPYING 
file shipped with the kernel sources, you could have answered at least 
one of your questions yourself.
But the exact borders of what is a "derived work" work and what is not 
are not well-defined and therefore unknown unless there have been court 
cases in all N countries you are distributing your product to.
Many things have never been challenged in court, and might never be, but 
remember that e.g. Harald Welte recently has much success with enforcing 
the GPL in cases of obvious violations at for products shipped in 
Germany at German courts.

I am not a lawyer, but the distribution alone shouldn't be a problem - 
that is similar to what most Linux distributions are doing.
