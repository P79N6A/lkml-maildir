I wrote a program that uses multicasting to send data.
 It works great on HP-UX but does not work on Fedora
Core 5.  I emailed the fedora list but they were of
little to no help.  
Does the kernel support SO_REUSEPORT?  If so can
anyone give me some suggestions why my program does
not work on Linux?  I did a route add -net 224.0.0.0/4
dev eth0 but that did not do anything.
Thanks,
Jesse
