Subject: [PATCH 0/19] Kconfig I18N completion
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
The following patches complete the "Kconfig I18N support" patch by
Arnaldo. 
The following parts are internationalised:
- Kconfig prompt, help, comment and menu texts
- full visible configuration interfaces
- error messages if the user can correct the errors (ex. saving config
file)
- answering (Y/M/N)
- option's value if it is a choice (viewing only)
Without I18N support:
- symbol names (CONFIG_xxx)
- Kconfig parsing errors in LKC
- lxdialog's errors
- content of the config file
- disabled debug messages in the source code
Some incomplete language files are downloadable from the
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tlktp/
 page for testing (langpack).
Currently available:
- Italian (98%)
- Hungarian (67%)
- French (37%)
- Catalan (10%)
- Russian (5%)
All patches are tested without any problems.
Please apply the patches.
Regards,
Egry Gabor
