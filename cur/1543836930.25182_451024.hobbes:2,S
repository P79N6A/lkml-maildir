Yes, please do explicitly mention headless.  I could see someone using
this for something with a head and causing some strange bugs.
Also, it might be a good idea to get rid of the "head" in the parameter.
Perhaps call it "start" or something else.  It's a little confusing to
have a headless list operation that calls the start of a list "head".
