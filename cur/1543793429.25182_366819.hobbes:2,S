Consider that people want to send you something which will work with the 
new kernel and are holding back until they can send you something which 
has a higher chance of working as delivered. If you want to avoid having 
a rediff be part of the integration testing I thought you were trying to 
avoid.
I interpreted that as people trying to make stuff easier for you.
