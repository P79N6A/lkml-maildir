Hi *, 
I am the new maintainer of the tcpdump package for Debian and in the 
progress of going through the bug reports. One of them is 
#21356: tcpdump: on 2.1.96, tcpdump uses obsolete (AF_INET,SOCK_PACKET)
> I get these message "tcpdump uses obsolete (AF_INET,SOCK_PACKET)" from
> my 2.1.96 kernel when starting tcpdump.  It still works fine, so
> I'm classing this as a "wishlist" bug.
I remember seeing these messages as well but they disappeared with 2.2.x
Is SOCK_PACKET still considered obsolete?
Thanks in advance
    Torsten
