Yes,  and gprs is also working nicely with the pppd so I can finally
start eating dog food :-)
Some problems there still are
1) As we do not yet have any kind of multiplexing support to gsm module
(currently directly accesing dev/ttyS1 for at commands)
our phone app is not able to run simultaneously with the ppp. I am not
sure should I resolve this in the kernel space or user space.
2) I can not suspend/resume by using power button but we have still
problem from waking up the iPAQ
from suspend for the incoming calls.
So far I have tried to enable UART2 wakeup by using
    level2_wake |= OMAP_IRQ_BIT(INT_MPUIO);
in omap_pm_wakeup_setup() method of plat-omap/pm.c but did not have
success with that.
Could you have any idea for this one?
