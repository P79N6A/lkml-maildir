Yes. I don't need and will disable when building T9.

PS2 keyboard. For clarification, I have intermittent problems with the 
keyboard on this machine with anything to do with preempt. Sometimes it 
works on boot sometimes it does not. Actually since it is so 
unpredictable, I can't even say for sure that it has to do with preempt, 
but it hasn't failed yet on rc4-mm1. I have tried to find a pattern and 
have yet to do so. Possibly pertinent info:
