My environment is:
        kernel 2.1.126
        ASUS SP97-V motherboard
        Logitech Intellimouse: configured as /dev/ps2aux, CONFIG_PSMOUSE
        XFree86 3.3.2, mouse configured as imps/2
The problem: The mouse occasionally gets stuck in the upper right-hand
corner of the screen. The only way to move the pointer is with <alt>F1.
Exitting fvwm doesn't help; Exiting X and restarting it makes the problem
go away.
I used the same X server with v2.1.86 for a long time. The problem didn't
turn up until v2.1.126.
