first of all, ext2_count_free_blocks() is used by orlov allocator
only which in turn is used to create dirs only. so, I do not think
dbench may show possible improvement. also, I understand it isn't
bottleneck absolutely, but I think it may reduce memory footprint.
Probably, we may use dcounters for huge fs only (i.e. make it
optional).
with best regards, Alex
