In my opinion, there is no requirement to wait after status read
returned success and the actual reading of data. This way we'd have to
have the delay in the interrupt routine as well.

So the only problem in the flush routine is the debugging print.

We may as well drop the negation. It's a bad way to signal the data came
from the AUX port. Then we don't need the extra status read and can just
proceed to read the data, since IMO we don't need to wait inbetween,
even according to the IBM spec.
