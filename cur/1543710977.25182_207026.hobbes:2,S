Ok, great, that works.

I think I'll only give it disks that I want in evms.  The "sde" is a USB
disk that I move around alot.
If you're not the right person to ask, please direct me to someone else.
I was going to do a raid5 across a few disks (this is in the future not
now).  Is there any way to add disks to that raid5 using evms?
