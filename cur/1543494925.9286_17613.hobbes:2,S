There's no shared storage style clustering in linux, so it's a moot point.
As soon as we can hook up the same array of SCSI disks to three different
linux boxes and have them all access the same ext2 filesystems on the shared
disks, then it will become a huge issue.
The reason is that you don't want to have to shutdown all of the machines to
upgrade them.  It's like if you update NFS.  You have to do it in a way such
that old clients can still talk to the new server and vice versa.  When you
have a tightly coupled cluster that essentally shares all of the filesystem
state (and other data too) among all the systems, this becomes every more
difficult.
