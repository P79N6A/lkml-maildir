Ok.... here's what happened,
- We changed the define so that it matched what we are using. We never configure
   more than 4 HBQ, thus the index will never be beyond 0-3. The if-check is actually
   innoculous. Given that the change wasn't your patch, we didn't include you as
   the author.
- Coding-wise, you are right, we still didn't fix the range check.
Since this really is just something to keep the tools happy - I'll recind the NACK.
I'll worry about simply removing this if-check later...
James/Andrew, accept this patch - ACK.
