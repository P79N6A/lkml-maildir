These exports are only needed for the HP simulator ... it seems
probable that the more likely fix is change Kconfig to prevent simscsi
from being built as a module.  I assume that any remaining SKI users
build this into the kernel ... arch/ia64/configs/sim_defconfig sets
CONFIG_HP_SIMSCSI=y for example.
