Uhh .... don't give me that. ModelSim is just one of these FlexLM horrors.
The best thing is, if you have multiple licenses on one dongle (to share on
the network) and the darn thing doesn't release them, when people stop using
the software.
Or people who simply couldn't get the stuff to work, because of some silly
printerport issues (voltage issues, whatsoever).
