Another old system that I recall was the CDC Cyber systems, which when I
encountered them used 6-bit 'bytes' (the null byte meaning ':' in some cases,
and null in others).  The linker resolved names to 7 characters, so it could
fit the name (42 bits) + an 18 bit address into a single 60 bit word.
One of the most useful rules of the GNU coding standards is that it asks people
to avoid putting arbitrary limits in their code:
	For example, Unix utilities were generally optimized to minimize memory
	use; if you go for speed instead, your program will be very different.
	You could keep the entire input file in core and scan it there instead
	of using stdio.  Use a smarter algorithm discovered more recently than
	the Unix program.  Eliminate use of temporary files.  Do it in one pass
	instead of two (we did this in the assembler).
	Or, on the contrary, emphasize simplicity instead of speed.  For some
	applications, the speed of today's computers makes simpler algorithms
	adequate.
	Or go for generality.  For example, Unix programs often have static
	tables or fixed-size strings, which make for arbitrary limits; use
	dynamic allocation instead.  Make sure your program handles NULs and
	other funny characters in the input files.  Add a programming language
	for extensibility and write part of the program in that language.
