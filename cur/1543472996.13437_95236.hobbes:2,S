And many of Linux's user-space networking utilities (and some significant 
chunks of the kernel --- not to mention at least one SCSI driver and 
probably other drivers) come from our colleagues in BSD development.  And 
then there's the Samba folks, etc.  If we must name the system to 
acknowledge all the contributing projects, we're going to end up with a 
decidedly Entish name.  :-)
