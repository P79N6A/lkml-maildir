It's currently not too nice as a built-in. Originally I did have it depend
on 'm' but maybe Ingo removed it? It's not depending on 'm' anymore in
x86/mm git tree Kconfig.
By default it reserves 32 MB/cpu of relay buffers during module init.
It's this big based on experimentation with the nvidia proprietary driver.
There is no other way than unloading the module to free the buffers, or
even to clear them. This means that every time you start the user space
logger application, it gets old data first. Also poking the module
parameters via /sys is not allowed.
So it's not actually broken as far as I know, it's just not nice IMHO.
And I've never tried it as built-in. I don't think anyone ever has.
I do have a plan to make it a nicer built-in, but it's a long way.

Ookay, this is the first time I hear about weak functions, and
that I could accomplish something like this with them.
I'll be googling around. These are completely new beasts to me.
Thanks for the keywords, finally I have a clue to follow.
