We can validate that claim entirely.  The way we are proceeding, the 
native code will be inlined or direct called as much as possible.  With 
the VMI-Linux code we had earlier, this mostly created <3% overhead for 
microbenchmarks (and in some cases, we actually won over the unmodified 
native code).  For macro-benchmarks, with real-world workloads, this 
reduced to immeasurable noise, never off by more than +/- 0.5% IIRC.
I believe all of this is totally achievable.  We have the technology.  
We can rebuild it.
