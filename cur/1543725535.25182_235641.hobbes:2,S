 Reading the documentation of the chip NM9835 I have
seen that bits 7,6,5 of ERP has to be 0 to get a SPP
mode. But ... i dont know the values for the rest of
bits..so I suppose you are saying that i have to write
it:
 options parport_pc io=0x378,0x8800 io_hi=0x778,0xNNN
irq=7,5
 NNN: io_hi value for the card....how can I get this
value? you know?
  Thanks a lot again!
  Eva
