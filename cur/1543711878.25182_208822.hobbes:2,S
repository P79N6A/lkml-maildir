Hi!

Yes, that would be great. [Bootsplash is in mainline but is in vendor
kernels => great, vendor kernels get splashscreen with progress bar
and vanilla kernel just plain old dots].

Ok, sorry about that one.

If it slims down a lot, great. If debugging code is gone, and progress
bar depends on bootsplash, we are left with something that looks like
output from swsusp1, right? And there should be little need to
configure it. Good.

Yes, thats _my_ todo.

Yes, but with eye candy its a bit more of a problem because progress
bar updating could obscure them.
