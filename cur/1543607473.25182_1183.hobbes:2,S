Here's the relevant portion of the RELEASE-NOTES document from RedHat 7.2:
"The initscripts now use /sbin/ip (from the iproute packages) for most
operations. /sbin/ip requires the netlink and netlink routing features
of the kernel to function properly; it is impossible to make use of
the kernel's full routing functionality without these features. If you
are building your own kernel, make sure that CONFIG_NETLINK and
CONFIG_RTNETLINK are enabled."
They accused us of suppressing freedom of expression.
This was a lie and we could not let them publish it.
