No, but there are alternative numbers. How about these?
"17% of the server market"
"server usage grew by more than a factor of three in 1998"
Hmmm...
Fueled by the support of all major database vendors, Linux server
usage in 1998 leapt by a factor of three to reach 17% market share.
That got a bit long and ugly. Maybe the source would need credit too.
