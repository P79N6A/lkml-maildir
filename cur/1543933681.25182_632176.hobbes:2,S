Actually, having it be a per-device thing would have fixed this particular 
problem, if only because the device probing would have been done without 
MMCONFIG (thus avoiding the bug), and then after it has been probed, it 
wouldn't have mattered if the driver enabled MMCONFIG for the device, 
since it would now have the right ID in "struct pci_device".
Sure, subsequent "lspci" users would still be confused, but the kernel 
itself would never have noticed anything strange.
Of course, just doing *all* initial probing without MMCONFIG would also 
have fixed it, which is another thing I advocate (regardless of any 
per-device setting).
