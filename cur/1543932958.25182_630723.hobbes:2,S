Um, what?  Kernel messages are *not* in English.
Take a look at a machine after it is freshly booted.  The following
messages are *not* English:
[    0.000000] BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
[    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 0000000000099800 (usable)

Do you really want to turn that into complete English sentences?
Or how about these?
[   15.069322] IP route cache hash table entries: 32768 (order: 5, 131072 bytes)
[   15.069830] TCP established hash table entries: 131072 (order: 8, 1048576 bytes)
[   15.070448] TCP bind hash table entries: 65536 (order: 9, 2359296 bytes)
[   15.077264] TCP: Hash tables configured (established 131072 bind 65536)
[   15.077278] TCP reno registered
[   15.086122] checking if image is initramfs... it is
[   15.846658] Freeing initrd memory: 7114k freed
Again, not sentences, and I don't think making every single printk a
gramatically valid sentence is a good thing.  Or even necessary.  And
in some cases, it would make the kernel messages harder to parse by an
automated log parser.
