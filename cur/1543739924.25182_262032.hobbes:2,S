The joy of "clever" string manipulation, I suppose :-(
The difference between the two branches is that the "command line"
thing uses only the parameter name, which cannot be quoted (well,
at least kernel/params.c doesn't let this happen). So the whole
problem can't occur.
If you quote the parameter name, the quotes will happily end up
in the argument, thanks to kernel/params.c.
Perhaps a better long-term solution would be to fix all this in
kernel/params.c, and remove any quote special-casing from
init/main.c. It just scares me to touch such a highly sensitive
area of the kernel ... :)
