Leap seconds are an integral part of the NTP standard for the reasons
I described.  You can't "update zoneinfo" because a leap second is
applied to *all* timezones... not just a single one.  Specifically,
each NTP message includes some bits indicating what the next
leap-second is going to be (at the end of the current month), whether
+1, 0, or -1.
I believe that under Linux if you request a monotonic clock then you
won't "experience" leap-seconds at all; although such a clock will
probably stop while your computer is suspended.  On the other hand, if
you explicitly ask for a wall-clock, it is the responsibility of NTP
to keep the wall-clock accurate to the actual passage of days, even if
that involves slight slewing adjustments.
The UTC timezone is explicitly defined to include "leap seconds", and
so we cannot honestly claim to implement the standard unless we
provide a method for those leap seconds to be applied.  If you don't
want leap-seconds, submit a patch to the ntp daemon to allow it to run
in "UT1" mode in which it will ignore leap second notifications over
the NTP protocol, or just use a GPS clock.
