NAK :-)
I did a quick look and many architecture have some definition of
virt_to_bus ...
$ grep -w virt_to_bus include/asm*/io.h
include/asm-alpha/io.h:static inline unsigned long virt_to_bus(void *address)
include/asm-alpha/io.h:#define isa_virt_to_bus virt_to_bus
include/asm-avr32/io.h:#define virt_to_bus virt_to_phys
include/asm-blackfin/io.h:#define virt_to_bus virt_to_phys
include/asm-cris/io.h:#define virt_to_bus virt_to_phys
include/asm-h8300/io.h:#define virt_to_bus virt_to_phys
include/asm-i386/io.h:#define virt_to_bus virt_to_phys
include/asm-ia64/io.h:#define virt_to_bus       virt_to_phys
include/asm-m32r/io.h:#define virt_to_bus       virt_to_phys
include/asm-m68knommu/io.h:#define virt_to_bus virt_to_phys
include/asm-mips/io.h:#define virt_to_bus virt_to_phys
include/asm-parisc/io.h:#define virt_to_bus virt_to_phys
include/asm-powerpc/io.h: * 32 bits still uses virt_to_bus() for it's implementation of DMA
include/asm-powerpc/io.h:static inline unsigned long virt_to_bus(volatile void * address)
include/asm-ppc/io.h:extern inline unsigned long virt_to_bus(volatile void * address)
include/asm-sh64/io.h:#define virt_to_bus virt_to_phys
include/asm-sh/io.h:#define virt_to_bus virt_to_phys
include/asm-sparc64/io.h:#define virt_to_bus virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map
include/asm-x86_64/io.h:#define virt_to_bus virt_to_phys
include/asm-xtensa/io.h: * virt_to_bus and bus_to_virt are deprecated.
include/asm-xtensa/io.h:#define virt_to_bus(x)  virt_to_phys(x)
and I am not in a position to tell whether each architecture wants it or
not.  At least the way I have it, each architecture maintainer can turn
it off as they want to.  Otherwise I have to edit every architecture's
Kconfig and add HAS_VIRT_TO_BUS to each one.
