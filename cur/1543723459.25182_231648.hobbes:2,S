If the driver can't cope then you *only* use DMA_MEMORY_MAPPED.

Well, I don't believe it will be necessary.  However, when an actual
user comes along, we'll find out.

The purpose of the API is to allow a mode of operation on all platforms
linux supports.

It is no-longer real memory once you use this API.  Even if the
processor can treat DMA_MEMORY_MAP memory as "real", you'll probably
find that a device off on another bus cannot even see it.  However, as
long as you keep the memory between the processor and the device then
you can treat it identical to RAM.

The intention of the flags option for dma_alloc_coherent() was only for
memory allocation instructions; the allocation can fail for other
reasons that unavailability of memory depending on how the API is
implemented, so __GFP_NOFAIL doesn't actually work now in every case. 
Thus this doesn't actually represent a departure.
