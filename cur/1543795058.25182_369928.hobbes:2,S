Sure, for real hardware doing that at boot time is be perfectly fine. 
In a virtual environment it's very useful to be able to plug in one more 
virtual CPU on demand without rebooting though.  The patch isn't very 
useful alone, it's more one step on the road of getting the xen bits 
merged mainline.

Ok, dropped.  I've just copyed that from the original, pretty ugly xen 
patch.
