I'd drop the FASTCALL stuff... nowadays with regparm that's automatic
and the cost of register-vs-stack isn't too big anyway
Also I'd rather not add the non-msec ones... either you're raw and use
HZ, or you are "cooked" and use the msec variant.. I dont' see the point
of adding an "in the middle" one. (Yes this means that several users
need to be transformed to msecs but... I consider that progress ;)
