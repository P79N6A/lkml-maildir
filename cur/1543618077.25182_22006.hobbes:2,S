Hi Pavel!

FUSE and AVFS are both multithreaded.  Specifically ftp is quite well
threaded, and a big download will not block any operation, even on the
same server.

What GRUB?

No, at the moment there are a few features missing in FUSE, that CODA
needs (access caching, reading directly from files, file
reintegration).  But it is perfectly possible to add these features to
FUSE if somebody wants them. 
Actually having real disk files as a backing store for virtual files
could be the solution to the page writeback problem.  The only
question is how to manage this in an efficient way.
