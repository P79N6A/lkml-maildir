Oh dear. Per-file pagesizes are foul. Better to fix up the pagecache's
radix tree than to restrict it like this. There are other attacks on the
multiple horizontal internal tree node allocation problem beyond
outright B+ trees that allow radix trees to continue to be used.

I've always wanted the awareness to be pervasive, so it's good to hear
there's someone with a common interest. If this effort takes off, I'd be
happy to contribute to it. I do wonder what ever happened with the gelato
codebase, though.

I'm afraid this may be approaching an underappreciated research topic.
Most sponsors of such research seem to have an active disinterest in
getting page replacement to properly interoperate with all this.

You don't know how glad I am to see someone actually hammering out code
on this front.
