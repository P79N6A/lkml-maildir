It's always difficult to know who to contact when there's an issue that
isn't specific to one single area. And since you are the 2.6 maintainer
I figured it wouldn't be too off base to throw this in your lap. ;)
This is a PCI device yes. Which has a number of card readers as
separate, hot-pluggable functions. Currently this means it interacts
with the block device and MMC subsystems of the kernel. As more drivers
pop up, the other card formats will probably get their own subsystems
the way MMC has. So there are three issues here:
 * Where to put the central module that handles the generic parts of the
chip and pulls in the other modules as needed.
 * If the subfunction modules should be put with the subsystems they
connect to or with the main, generic module.
