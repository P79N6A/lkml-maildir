Haven't bothered. But I'm getting those errors and the inability to set up
MTRR's by X too.
I've got a hunch that in my case it depends on how big MTRR vesafb driver 
sets up for itself during boot ... if it's the same size X later asks then
everything is ok.
Usually it's 16MB for vesafb in my machine and 32MB for X. So i've always
just disabled the MTRR set up by vesafb (echo "disable=n" > /proc/mtrr) and
restart X before playing games. This way no problem.
