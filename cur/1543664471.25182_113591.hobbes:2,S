At first I was jokeing, but what the heck, I figured I'd run
it.  Here are the mispelled words that occur in five
or more files and that lookd like real misspellings to my eye.
The list contains some words that are ok in British usage;
I don't have a British spellchecker (that I know how to use).
Perhaps some eagr Perl monger can (after removing the British-ok
words!) contribute a spellcorrect-kernel program that takes
in a liste of known misspellings + corrections, and applies
them to the commments in all kernel source files...
