And why not 4., have a per fs flag (say fs_{,set_,clear_,}generic_aops())
(or per superblock flag or whatever, perhaps a per address space flag
even?) specifying whether the fs' aops support loop or not. loop.c then
simply does:
if (fs_generic_aops()/fs_aops_support_loop()/whatever...)
	use aops ->readpage and ->{prepare,commit}_write
else
	use fops ->read and ->write
I guess that is like point 2, just making it a simple generic mechanism so
that loop always works yet users of address spaces are free to implement
their ->readpage and ->{prepare,commit}_write anything they want...
Best regards,
