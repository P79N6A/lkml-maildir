Please don't extend TIOCLINUX.  It was a bad mistake to begin with,
and furthermore, we're trying to move away from ioctl()s (ioctl()s
were used because most changes affected *all* consoles.  Per-console
changes should be done with escape codes.)
I'm working on a completely new console spec that is ISO
2022-compliant (the current console isn't, and cannot be made to be.)

One of the reasons I'm doing this is so non-console terminals will be
able to accept the same interface.

Good spotting.
