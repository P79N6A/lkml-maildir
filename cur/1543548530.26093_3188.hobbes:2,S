Interesting, I'll try and run with this. The mention of networks reminds
me that any "max service time" variable is a tunable quantity depending on
current conditions..
.. and sct's block device I/O accounting patches give us the current
average request service time on a per-device basis. Multiply that up a bit
and maybe you have your threshold for moving things to the head of the
queue.
Cheers
