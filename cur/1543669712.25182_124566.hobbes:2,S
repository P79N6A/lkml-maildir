That's right, I like it better that way, too!
Thank you for the patch!

Thanks for the detailed answer.

I don't think so, as this is part of the buddy allocator which controls the 
usage of the physical memory. Now I've implemented following:
1. Add an entry when a page is removed by the kswapd.
2. Remove the entry when the page is added to the page_cache.
3. Remove the entry when the page is removed from the page_cache.
So with point 3 I cover the freeing of the pages. But as the kswapd calls the 
function from 3, too, I do the 1st point after kswapd did do point3...
To finish my second (and surely better) try I just need one more 
information...
How can I get the file pointer for a buffered page with the information 
available in the kswapd (minly the page struct)??
This is very importand because, as described above, I extract the needed 
information for my prefetch daemon in the kswapd. My daemon needs the file 
pointer to be able to load the buffer pages with the page_cache_read() 
function from the mm/filemap.c file.
I'm sorry if I bother you...
