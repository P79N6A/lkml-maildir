Hi,
maybe my previous posting got lost somehow (didn't receive any reponse).
There is a bug in ip_output.c:ip_queue_xmit().
After re_allocation of headroom, skb_set_owner_w() is called for the old
and already freed skb instead of the new one. This (a) referes a possibly
dangling pointer and (b) might cause bogus socket memory accounting.
The following patch will fix this. (It's against 2.2.12, but should
also apply against current 2.3.x).

BTW: Is there any reason why the setting of the new skb's ownership is not
done within skb_realloc_headroom() itself?
