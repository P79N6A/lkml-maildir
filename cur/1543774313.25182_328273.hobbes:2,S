I had to move to a different box, but get the same kind of results (for ext3
default mount options).
Here are the latencies (all cfq) I get with different values for the mount
parameters
ext2 default
0.1s
ext3 default
52.6s avg
reiser defaults
29s avg 5 minutes
then, 
12.9s avg
ext3 rw,noatime,data=writeback
0.1s avg
reiser rw,noatime,data=writeback
4s avg for 20 seconds
then 0.1 seconds avg
So, indeed adding noatime,data=writeback to the mount options improves things a
lot.
I also tried without the noatime, and that doesn't make much difference to me.
That looks like a good workaround, I'll now try with the actual server and see
how things go.
