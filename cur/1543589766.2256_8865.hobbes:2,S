I think that this is slightly off-topic, but I figure that
someone here knows the answer or where to point me to the
answer.  Please respond privately so the entire list is not
spamed by the response.
I am writing a threaded network daemon using a thread per
connection model (I know, it is not the most effective, but
I can extend it to use a thread per N connections in the future).
That thread waits on a socket using select, or possibly merely
doing a read.  Messages to be written are inserted into a queue
in shared memory.  I am looking for a way to send the thread a 
signal or event to cause the thread to abort the read or select
call when data is available.
I know that it would be possible to create a unix socket
and write a byte to that socket whenever data is available,
but there should be a simpler message or signal that I can 
send to the thread to accomplish the same thing.
Thanks,
Laramie
