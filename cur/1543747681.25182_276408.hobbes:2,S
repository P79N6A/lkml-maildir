OK, I took a quick look through - there's two places where we use
GFP_ATOMIC at the moment.  One is a log debug/tracing chunk of code,
wont be coming into play here, I'll go back and rework that later.
The second is in the metadata buffering code, and is in a spot where
we can cope with a failure (don't need to dip into emergency pools
at all) but looks like we're avoiding sleeping there.
Does this patch improve things for your workload, Stefan?
cheers.
