I'm having this problem too, for a long time. It's usually associated with big loads ( for my machine, of course, a PII-233 ). It has happened while opening lot's of pages with opera, but has also happened while compiling 3 kernels at the same time and playing a video with xine or aviplay.
The behavior is the same: ps blocks, gtop blocks, killall blocks, anything that tries to get the process information blocks too.
The machine can be used as long as a program does not try to call the problematic function, whitch I wasn't able to trace down. 
I haven't had this problem for a while, basically because I try not to stress these ``hanging'' applications anymore, so that I can work, but I'll try to see if I can reproduce the bug with the new VM.
The problem is: what can we do, to investigate the problem, once ps starts to block? 
Regards,
Marcelo.
