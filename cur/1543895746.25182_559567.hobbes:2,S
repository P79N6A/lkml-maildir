Indeed, if you want what Davide described, you need to also change
signalfd side. The patch I did merely prevents another thread from
dequeuing somebody else private signals. As it stands, signalfd will
still try it... and only get the shared ones. It will not however get
the private signals of the caller if it is different from the context
associated with the signalfd.
