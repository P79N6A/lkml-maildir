This is on purpose.  The idea is that realtime processes get all the 
time they request.  If the kernel threads are interrupting the realtime 
app, then the latency of the realtime app is degraded.

If you want specific kernel threads to take priority, you can always 
manually make then SCHED_RR/SCHED_FIFO yourself.
