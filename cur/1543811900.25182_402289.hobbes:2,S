It would help to split these emails into smaller chunks than all the files
so that comments could be with the chunks that it goes with.
Kconfig.diff	- fine, no problems here
Makefile.diff	- going to have to remove those #s at somepoint
regs-clock.diff - didn't need to add s3c2412_get_pll, same as s3c2410_get_pll 
regs-gpio.diff	- group the s3c2412 changes together into larger #ifdefs
regs-irq.diff	- looks fine
regs-rtc.diff	- two sets of changes here? 2410 and 2412 additions
s3c2412_c.diff	- looks fine
s3c2412_h.diff	- looks fine
cpu.diff:
the 2412 is an ARM926EJS, so I'd expect the core-ID accessed
via the co-processor registers to be diffeernt, so this could give
the indication of what sort of CPU to try.
this also seems to have the S3C2442 ID patch from the patch-q in it,
please be careful about merging patches like that.
