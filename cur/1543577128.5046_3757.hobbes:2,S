Yes the machine is otherwise rock stable, not overclocked and memory timings
are rather conservative. Before the oops the machine had been compiling some
major application for like 5 hours and maybe the excessive stress kicked a
bit somewhere - who knows.

That's one I can't reproduce. I've just run memtest86 over the entire ram
and it doesn't show any oddities - which doesn't really rule out an
occassional bit-flip due to neutrino storms though ;-)
If someone else has seen something similar lately, it's time to speak up.
