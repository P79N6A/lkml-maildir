Yeah, thanks.

Haven't made too much progress on this, but I have asked someone@amd who
might be able to at least know the right person to ask :P (might be faster
to ask Andi to ask :))
If you know someone at Intel then that would be appreciated.
It would be nice if it is safe (and can be guaranteed to be safe in future).
However OTOH, the fastpath may be even faster if we do it in a "definitely
safe" way.
That is, do the xaddw against 16-bits with the head in 8 of those and the
tail in the other 8. Then compare the byte registers of the register
returned by xaddw for the test. Although the xaddw is going to be slower
than an xaddb, this way we subsequently avoid the extra load completely,
while avoiding ordering issues.
In the slowpath we would have to have a token locked op in there (like
the current spinlocks do), but this could be taken out iff our inquiries
come back positive.
Anyway, I'll try redoing the patch and getting some numbers.
