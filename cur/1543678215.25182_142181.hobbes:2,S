Hi Justin, list ...
I have a 2xPIII 797 Mhz with an AIC-7899P U160/m; I have 
been running it under 2.5.66 since it was released, always 
using the AIC7XXXX driver (new one).
However, suddenly something weird happened; since one week
ago, I get panics (in the serial console) like
the one attached (milikk.panic.txt) always caused or having
an rsync process as current (rsync is used for backup).
I also noticed that at about the same time I started to
get got those panics, I get the following when booting 
the kernel:
scsi0 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 6.2.28

..... <SNIPPED- full version @ attached milikk.dump> ...
So I wonder, what does that error mean? SCSI1 has attached a 
CDRW (Sony Yamaha CDRW 8/4/24) but now it doesn't show up 
anymore (and so, I cannot get the model). .
Could it mean by SCSI Adapter is hosed? or my CDRW drive?
or something else? I see this same behavior with 2.5.72,
although it gets stuck in "scsi1: Unexpected busfree while
idle\nSEQADDR == 0x31", repeats it, goes up to 0x32,
back to 0x31 again, repeats 0x31 ... 
Removing the CDRW helps (no more message) so I tend to assume
the CDRW is dead; but I am still waiting to see a panic again.
Thanks,
