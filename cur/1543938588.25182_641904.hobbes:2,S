I mentioned this already but received no response (maybe I am missing 
something totally obvious here):
When we call fallback_alloc() because the current node has ->nodelists 
set to NULL, we end up calling kmem_getpages() with -1 as the node id 
which is then translated to numa_node_id() by alloc_pages_node. But the 
reason we called fallback_alloc() in the first place is because 
numa_node_id() doesn't have a ->nodelist which makes cache_grow() oops.
