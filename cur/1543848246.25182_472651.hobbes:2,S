No, you're a factor of 1000 off - these numbers show the context switch 
is around 1600-75000 cycles.  And that doesn't really tell the whole 
story: if caches/TLB get flushed on context switch, then the newly 
switched-to task will bear the cost of having cold caches, which isn't 
visible in the raw context switch time.
But modern x86 processors have a very quick context switch time, and I 
don't think there's much room for improvement aside from 
micro-optimisations (though that might change if the architecture grows 
a way to avoid flushing the TLB on switch).
