No. Not after -rc1. Not for something that changes core code and isn't a 
core feature, and wasn't a regression.

No. The core issue here is that people need to understand that if you miss 
the merge window, and it's new development, YOU DAMN WELL WAIT FOR THE 
NEXT ONE.
Don't send me pull requests like this. And absolutely do NOT send them as 
resends. I just  get grumpy.
If all the added code had been KVM-only, I might not care. But when the 
bulk of the code touches core files, you had better explain why this is so 
important that it cannot wait for the next merge window.
