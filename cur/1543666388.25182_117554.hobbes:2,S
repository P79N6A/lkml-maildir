I was just saying that recommending it (ext2) compiled into the kernel
and not a module should be the safe route for newbies to kernel
compiles.
Those of us that have build a few to feel comfortable with it, will know
to compile the fs of our / partition into the kernel.
Except if ext2 is not the most commonly used fs anymore.  I guess a
'cool' feature could be if the make system could 'detect' what your
current root is and warn if you do not have that compiled into your
kernel, but I do not know the limitations of it (the make system).
Then on the other hand, would above be confusing if its a kernel
compiled for another box ?
