That would be the idea. gcc would learn how to use the %gs segment prefix
(similar to the equivalent feature in Windows compilers). The only
drawback is that it still cannot easily load the address except if you
define some silly convention (like a pointer to the segment base being
always stored at the segment base address) 
But it is a lot of work to teach gcc about the multiple address spaces...
