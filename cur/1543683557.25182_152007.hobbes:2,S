 Kernel compilation

 Due to changes in the length of the phone number field, isdn4k-utils
 needs to be recompiled or (preferably) upgraded.
 
+NFS-utils
+---------
+
+In 2.4 and earlier kernels, the nfs server needed to know about any
+client that expected to be able to access files via NFS.  This
+information would be given to the kernel by "mountd" when the client
+mounted the filesystem, or by "exportfs" at system startup.  exportfs
+would take information about active clients from /var/lib/nfs/rmtab.
+
+This approach is quite fragile as it depends on rmtab being correct
+which is not always easy, particularly when trying to implement
+fail-over.  Even when the system is working well, rmtab suffers from
+getting lots of old entries that never get removed.
+
+With 2.6 we have the option of having the kernel tell mountd when it
+gets a request from an unknown host, and mountd can give appropriate
+export information to the kernel.  This removes the dependency on
+rmtab and means that the kernel only needs to know about currently
+active clients.
+
+To enable this new functionality, you need to:
+
+  mount -t nfsd nfsd /proc/fs/nfs
+
+before running exportfs or mountd.  It is recommended that all NFS
+services be protected from the internet-at-large by a firewall where
+that is possible.
