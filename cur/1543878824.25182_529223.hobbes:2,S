Thinking about this.  As contingency planning if there is something in user
space that actually somehow cares about pdeath_signal, from a threaded
parent we can add a pdeath_signal list, to the task_struct and get
rid of the rest of the complexity.
I think I want to wait until someone screams first.
This does very much mean that we can remove the complexity of
a per thread ->children without fear, of having to revert everything.
