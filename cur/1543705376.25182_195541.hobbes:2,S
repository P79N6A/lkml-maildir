Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Mouse0"
        Driver      "mouse"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/psaux"
        Option      "Protocol" "ExplorerPS/2"
        Option      "Buttons" "7"
        Option      "Emulate3Buttons" "on"
        Option      "ZAxisMapping" "6 7"
EndSection
And if I *had* gotten it in there twice, why would it only hit sporadically
once or twice a day, as opposed to *all* mouse events (clicks, moves,
etc) being doubled?
