I have been testing on this box before but never with such long latencies
before.

I actually felt like the box went to sleep.

I have had problems with power-saving before on this box. The  effect is
usually the other way around: The rtdcs used to meassure the timing slows
down. I.e. it ought to meassure very short times, not very long times.
I'll try to disable power-management.

Hmm. If it is a DMA transfer for the network device it ought to make bad
latencies for any network traffic not only NFS. I will have to test
various things during the weekend.
