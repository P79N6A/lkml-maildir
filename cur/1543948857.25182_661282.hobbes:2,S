Indeed! It was in "IDE" mode, and 2 out of the 3 chips were handled by the 
piix driver (btw, why did Intel put 3 different SATA controllers on one 
board?). I switched it to AHCI mode (the third possibility is RAID) and 
indeed a kernel with (only) ahci driver managed to bring them up! 
Although, the eSATA link was "slow to respond":
ata4: port is slow to respond, please be patient (Status 0x80)
ata4: softreset failed (device not ready)
ata4: port is slow to respond, please be patient (Status 0x80)
ata4: softreset failed (device not ready)
ata4: port is slow to respond, please be patient (Status 0x80)
ata4: SATA link up 3.0 Gbps (SStatus 123 SControl 300)
ata4.00: ATA-7: WDC WD1600BB-00RDA0, 20.00K20, max UDMA/100
ata4.00: 312581808 sectors, multi 16: LBA48
ata4.00: applying bridge limits
ata4.00: configured for UDMA/100
but then it did manage it. Is such a delay normal?
One more question, what do UDMA numbers mean in SATA context? The internal 
SATA disk is "ata1.00: configured for UDMA/133", but should be SATA-2.
Thanks
