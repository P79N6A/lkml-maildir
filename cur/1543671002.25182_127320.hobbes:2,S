Usually one wants to use the standard commands for I/O.
But if the purpose is to talk to the drive (set password,
set native max, eject, change ZIP drive from big floppy
mode to removable disk mode, etc. etc.) then one needs
a means to execute IDE commands "by hand".
Also SCSI has an ioctl for "do command by hand".
