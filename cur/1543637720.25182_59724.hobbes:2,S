With the current set of macros I will agree that it becomes error
prone, to use large offsets.  So perhaps we should just provide
the larger type in the MASK and ALIGN functions.  Having to track
if you are using a 64bit type to closely is problematic.   An alternative
is to ignore the ALIGN macro and provide PAGE_OFFSET instead of PAGE_MASK,
which keeps the supplied values small.

It would also be interesting to see if the value was ULL if it would make the
code worse.

For the internals of ntfs, and similar systems I will concede that a 64bit value
may be a more natural intermediate type.  This doesn't mean we need to do
weird things in the generic code.

The page cache limit is currently 44bits/16TB on x86.  Current drives
are currently running at about 37-38 bits.  Which means it takes about
64 drives to blow the current page cache.  So we probably have 2 or 3
years before this becomes a concern with commodity hardware.  And we
should have commodity 64bit cpus by then.  We can afford to
hold off a little longer.
For disk sizes we need the larger sector_t simply because drives
really are exceeding it, today.
