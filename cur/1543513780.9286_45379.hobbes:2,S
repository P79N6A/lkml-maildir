Yes, it seems that I bugged you for nothing. After logging in as root it
worked fine. There must be some permissions that I couldn't access as a
regular user, or some paths were set wrong.
Anyway, the menuconfig worked. However, I couldn't get it to compile for
some reason. I don't know if RH6.1 upgrade has modified my /usr/src/linux,
but seeing that 2.2.13 has been released I just downloaded that.
We'll see if I get this to compile - make dep is so far so good. :)
Anyway, sorry for the fuzz and thanks to you guys for great work!
