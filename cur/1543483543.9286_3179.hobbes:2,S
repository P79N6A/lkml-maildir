I seem to be having some troubles with the token ring driver from the
2.2.{0,1} kernels on a Thinkpad 770 (with pcmcia-cs-3.0.8).  I've
tried it with both an "IBM Auto 16/4" and a "IBM Turbo 16/4" both of
which work with a 2.0.35 kernel on the same machine.
There is a double beep as to indicate successful PCMCIA recognition
but then begins to generate a series of error messages:
  Jan 29 06:27:58 avegno kernel: tr0: open failed: ret_code = 34, retrying
  Jan 29 06:28:13 avegno kernel: tr0: open failed: ret_code = 34, retrying
  Jan 29 06:28:33 avegno kernel: tr0: open failed: ret_code = 34, retrying

  Jan 29 06:36:19 avegno kernel: tr0: open failed: ret_code = 34, retrying
  Jan 29 06:36:39 avegno kernel: tr0: open failed: ret_code = 34, retrying
  Jan 29 06:36:44 avegno kernel: tr0: open failed: ret_code = 34, retrying
Does anybody have any suggestions about how best to proceed?
Thanks,
