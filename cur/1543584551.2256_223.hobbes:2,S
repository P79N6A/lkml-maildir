Yep.
The bigger problem with that driver for pedants is that it contains globals with
names like 'hard_error' which are asking for clashes . Bizarrely all
the static functions are carefully named ahc_* and the globals are called
things like 'restart_squencer'
The EISA probe code is also horrible, but thats not Justin's fault. Someone
needs to put some eisa_* bus functions into the kernel for that and some
of the other drivers.
