One task doing ptrace() can basically do whatever it wants with the
task being traced.  This is not an exact analogy to what fuse does,
but close.
And for this reason the security model for allowing access to a fuse
filesystem is similar to that for allowing tracing.
The gory details can be found in Documentation/filesystems/fuse.txt.
