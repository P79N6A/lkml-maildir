Is this really the right thing to add. The only purpose of these few lines
is a poor sanity check as down further in the code a pointer to the
structure is already present in hostdata. 
Adding the "p" is an indication that this drivers list got corrupted some
where.
I agree it may be better than an oops, but what else is invalid?
You need to have adaptec controllers in the system to get a procfs node
to read / write, but this error could be related to the node not getting
cleaned up correctly on a remove which a patch has previously been
posted.
