Ahh, yes.  Thank you for spotting this.  include/asm-i386/spinlock.h has
two separate defines for spin_unlock and we only renamed one of them.  I
guess you hit the conditional that used the other define...
The attached patch fixes it.

I only keep around patches to the last official kernel, plus the latest
-pre and -ac I patched.  Since the patch itself is being updated, its a
pain to backport to older kernels.
