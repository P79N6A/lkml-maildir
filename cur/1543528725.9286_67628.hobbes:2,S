i960CA doesn't have an MMU. There are models that DO have an MMU. 
Back in '92 when I worked with the i960 processor, commercial users
could buy processors with one out of:
	- Super scalar
	- MMU & ???
	- Floating point unit. 
US Military could buy any two of those. But 8 years is a lot in
computer-industry.
