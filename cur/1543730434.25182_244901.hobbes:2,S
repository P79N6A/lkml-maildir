This particular mismatch occurs because the Kconfig entry
doesn't have a "default" line, so Kconfig defaults to "n".
It makes little sense to disable PERFCTR_VIRTUAL when
PERFCTR is enabled, so providing a "default y" for
PERFCTR_VIRTUAL is the right thing to do.
(It's an option because the design allows several
independent high-level services on top of the low-level
code. Currently there's only one high-level service in
2.6-mm, but with several it's reasonable to allow users
to enable only those they actually want.)

Feel free to do so :-)
