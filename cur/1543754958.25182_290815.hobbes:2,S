No, PCI quirks are for fixing broken things.  VGA cards are entitled to
3c0-3df and all their 10-bit aliases.  I've been thinking for a while that we should mark the 10-bit aliases of ISA devices as used ... ie:
x100-x3ff
x500-x7ff
x900-xbff
xd00-xfff
Unfortunately, that may break some legitimate setups, but is hinted at
being a good idea in the EISA docs I've read.  My laptop uses only the
10-bit aliases of motherboard space (x000-x0ff, x400-x4ff, x800-x8ff,
xc00-xcff) for devices, except for the ISA bridge, which gets:
1180-11bf : 0000:00:1f.0
  1180-11bf : pnp 00:0b
The K6-2 is similar; only 10-bit aliases of motherboard space except for:
0a79-0a79 : isapnp write
Possibly a better solution (less likely to break things) would be to allow
drivers to reserve the 10-bit aliases too.  Something like this:
static inline void request_isa_alias_regions(unsigned long start,
                unsigned long n, const char *name)
{
        int base;
        for (base = 0x400; base < 0x10000; base += 0x400) {
                request_region(base + start, n, name);
        }
}
and then call that in drivers/video/console/vgacon.c
Russell, would that allay your issues with the kernel io resource database?

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep
