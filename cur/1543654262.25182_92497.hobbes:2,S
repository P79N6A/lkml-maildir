IMHO it's a bit dangerous. It even inspired me to my first gcc
patch, adding a warning for: 
	bla > 0 ? : somethingelse
(boolean expression as first argument) 
returning the boolean value for true which would be always 1. But the real 
intention was to return bla. I did this mistake at least twice. After that 
I decided to avoid this extension. Unfortunately the gcc guys ignored the patch
to warn for it.
