Hi Sascha,
Thanks for the review and for the comments! I'm fixing them all, except 
for a couple points which I'm not sure I agree with:

Yes, I also considered that. Dan, would you accept that? What makes it 
defferent from other drivers/dma drivers, is that this one also has an irq 
driver.

Yeah... They are used pretty consistent now throughout the driver, and are 
used for functions internal, static, maybe only called once... But if you 
prefer, I can remove underscores, sure.

It is used in more than one place - implicitly in others. I did try to use 
the pointer everywhere in the new code where it wasn't too expensive, to 
make it at least easier if anyone ever decides to switch to dynamic 
allocation. So, I wouldn't throw away all those "ugly" calculations and 
replace them with the static variable, but if you think that'd be better, 
I can do that.

Why? You wouldn't take a mutex under spinlock, and the other way round is 
fine:-). I think both are needed - spinlock for ISR, atomic contexts for 
atomic operations like modifying registers, lists. And the mutex for 
sleeping contexts.

What are you worried about? The size of irq_desc[]? Well, we could make 
error interrupts dependent on a CONFIG_ macro, and let drivers that need 
them select that option, because so far they are not used. Otherwise, I 
think it is good to have all those bits on separate IRQs. What would you 
do? Request only two IRQs - function and error and then demux them 
manually, reinventing the generic irq subsystem? Doesn't seem very optimal 
to me...
Thanks
