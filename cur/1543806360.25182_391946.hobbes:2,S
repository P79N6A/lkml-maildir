Man, I saw that LATENCY_TRACING and completely missed the NUMA
parameter. Sorry about that...
I must be the only person running a uniprocessor x86_64 that's working
with the -rt patches and trying to trace latencies. If I turn off
LATENCY_TRACING, I boot just fine. 
Are you getting any output from the kernel before the reboot?
