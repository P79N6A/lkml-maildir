Hi all kernel users!
I am currently working on implementing link state
detection with netlink notification on a Linux 2.4.24
kernel.
The first solution that comes to my mind is to add a
call to netdev_state_change() inside the
netif_carrier_on() and netif_carrier_off() functions.
But after reading the list archive ab out it, my
understanding is that it is not possible to call
netdev_state_change() at this level. This seems to be
related being or not inside interrupts.
Could anyone explain this to me?
The right solution seems to be a kernel thread that
looks up the device chain and tests the IFF_RUNNING
flag to decide or not to notify netlink. Couldn't this
set a performance problem?
Testing the ETHTOOL_GLINK flag also seems a good idea
to me. Which one is the most generic?
As I understand it, this feature was one of the aims
of the 2.5 kernel. Is it implemented in 2.6? Would you
advise me any piece of code to have a look at?
Thank you in advance.
