Hi Willy,
No, those dir and files were created server-side, sorry I gave wrong 
impression, I still get on client side:
grant@sempro:/home/other$ uname -r
2.4.34b
grant@sempro:/home/other$ mkdir test
grant@sempro:/home/other$ ln -s test testlink
ln: creating symbolic link `testlink' to `test': Operation not permitted
grant@sempro:/home/other$ echo "this is also a test" > test/file
grant@sempro:/home/other$ ln -s test/file test2
ln: creating symbolic link `test2' to `test/file': Operation not permitted
trying to create symlinks.
No problems creating symlinks with 2.4.33.3.
Grant.
