They seem to have settled down, without advancing to anything satisfactory.
7/7 is particularly amusing at the moment (added complexity with no payoff).

Well put.  Christoph's patches stubbornly remain a _good_ hack for one
very specific initial workload (multi-parallel faulting of anon memory)
on one architecture (ia64, perhaps a few more) important to SGI.
I don't see why the mainline kernel should want them.

Aside from 7/7 (and some good asm primitives within headers),
the code itself is not complex; but it is more complex to think about,
and so less obviously correct.

I don't think so.  But my main worry remains the detriment to other
architectures, which still remains unaddressed.
Nick's patches (I've not seen for some while) are a different case:
on the minus side, considerably more complex; on the plus side,
more general and more aware of the range of architectures.
I'll write at greater length to support these accusations later on.
