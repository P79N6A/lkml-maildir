That is what I thought you might say. I have been digging around in the
code, trying to figure out the answer to that question myself.  For some
reason, even though that patch worked, it just didn't 'feel' right.  I
was looking for someone to confirm that there was a bigger problem to
search for.  Now I'll go back and hunt down the bigger beast and find
out why that hwif->mate is coming out null.
