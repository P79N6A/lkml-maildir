/me greps in -mm
#define CH_DEVICE(devid, ssid, idx) \
	{ PCI_VENDOR_ID_CHELSIO, devid, PCI_ANY_ID, ssid, 0, 0, idx }
[...]
enum {
       CH_BRD_N110_1F,
       CH_BRD_N210_1F,
       CH_BRD_T210_1F,
};
[...]
struct pci_device_id t1_pci_tbl[] = {
	CH_DEVICE(7, 0, CH_BRD_N110_1F),
	CH_DEVICE(10, 1, CH_BRD_N210_1F),
	{ 0, }
};
-> it does not match your 0006 revision. No wonder nothing gets detected.
As a quick hack, one could cross fingers and add a
CH_DEVICE(6, 0, CH_BRD_N110_1F)
or, if it does not work:
CH_DEVICE(6, 1, CH_BRD_N210_1F)
(the drivers code suggests some deep differences between CH_BRD_N210_1F
and CH_BRD_N110_1F wrt irq management for instance)
If it does not work at all, someone will have to dissect the whole
thing. Please fill an entry at bugzilla.kernel.org, add it your lspci info
and make it link the 2.6.6 driver from Chelsio's website.
