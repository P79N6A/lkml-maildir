Subject: NFSv3 for linux. New patch against 2.2.10...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The --hopefully last-- NFSv3 client patch for linux-2.2.10 has been
put out on the usual place:
  Please find patch
   
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/linux-2.2.10-nfsv3-0.9.11.5.dif.bz2
Please note that in order to mount NFSv3 partitions using this patch,
you will also need the patched version of the 'mount' program that can 
be found under 
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/nfsv3-mount
bugs fixed wrt. the 0.9.11.4:
 - Fix handling of stale directories.
 - Fix handling of open with 'O_TRUNC' mode.
 - Fixed calculation of file system size.
NB: I now hope to start a rewrite of the NFSv3 code, in order to try
to simplify it (get rid of the 'cluster' concept) in the hope of
seeing Linus accept it into the main kernel during the next
development cycle.
(Sorry, I don't see myself finding the time to finish this in time
for the code freeze deadline for 2.3).
Cheers,
  Trond
