Do you have a pointer to the most recent version of that patch you
were going to submit?  I've got one final batch of ext3-related things
to submit, containing no bug-fixes but only tweaks and new features
(eg. allowing you to specify the commit interval per-filesystem).  I
can merge the b_inode diff for that batch if you want.
