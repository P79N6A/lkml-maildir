Nope :).

I've never ever found it to work, so I usually disable it.

The keyboard was still dead after resume.

This worked. Strangely enough, after googling for i8042 and suspend
last night, I found the 2.6.12 kernel boot options file. I tried
i8042.nomux, i8042.direct, and some others, but nothing worked. Just
for fun, I tried booting without any kernel boot options (just the
suspend2 option) and with a PS/2 mouse plugged in. On suspend, the
keyboard worked.
Maybe this could/should be added to the suspend2 code as well?
Whatever. It works for now. If you'd like any more information, just
let me know. Thanks!
