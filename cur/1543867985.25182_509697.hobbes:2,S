Well you could just apply the patch set, but I stuck them in the same
directory as above .. I'll delete them in 24 hours or so ..
At one point I replaced sched_clock() , 
ftp://source.mvista.com/pub/dwalker/clocksource/clocksource-v10/add_generic_sched_clock.patch
The API is similar to that version, and sched_clock was the simplest
user of the API that I've done.
