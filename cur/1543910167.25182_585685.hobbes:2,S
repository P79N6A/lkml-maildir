I take it you're in 64-bit mode?
You're right, this data compresses well in many circumstances. I
suspect it will suffer under memory pressure though. That will
fragment the ranges in-memory and also fragment the active bits. The
worst case here is huge, of course, but realistically I'd expect
something like 2x-4x.
But there are still the downsides I have mentioned:
- you don't get page frame numbers
- you can't do random access
And how long does it take to pull the data out? My benchmarks show
greater than 50MB/s (and that's with the version in -mm that's doing
double buffering), so that 800K would take < .016s.

You can do anywhere between 16k small reads or 1 large read. Depends
what data you're trying to get. Right now, kpagemap is fast enough
that I can do realtime displays of the whole of memory in my desktop
in a GUI written in Python. And Python is fairly horrible for drawing
bitmaps and such.

Except that it's only providing a subset of the data.
