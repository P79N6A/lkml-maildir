Ah...
I understand. I also don't like URLs in email as my browser and mailer are 
different.
I am really sorry, the best I can do is post a link to actuall tarball which 
is: 
http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/kgdb-2/linux-2.6.1-kgdb-2.0.4.tar.bz2
I believe people will have me on their spammers list if I actually inflate 
this tarball and send as attachments. I sent 3 such postings this week!
