Subject: Large disk partition over 300GB

I don't know if this is the appropriate place to ask this question. I have a 
server with a huge amount of disk space (300GB+). After the file system is 
created, the partition is mounted under /home2. However, the size of the 
partition is significantly smaller than expected. The transcript below will 
provide better detail. The
disk is about 320GB. But the file system only see roughly 265GB. Is this a 
limitation with the kernel or the file system? It is expected that the 
capacity of the formatted partition will be less. But in this case the loss 
is around 55GB (~ %18) which is quite significant.
If anyone can give me some feedback or pointer about this issue, it is 
greatly appreciated.

[root@cust /tmp]# fdisk /dev/sdb
The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 40429.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)
