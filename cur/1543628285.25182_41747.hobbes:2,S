Nope. It's a HP Vectra, a loyal Intel based box.
Right now I ssh'ed to my NFS server, ran top and held [space] down.
I saw it there too. What do you see on your box?
I modified top to show 'raw' counter difference too:
0000001b 00000014 00000000 000001cb   5.3% user,  3.9% system,  0.0% nice, 90.7% idle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
and it's easy to notice that last number turns into ffffffff sometimes.
