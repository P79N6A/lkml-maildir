You are definitely right! After first reading Dave's description I got
it the same way, but after re-reading I probably was misled with this
"thus"! Only now I've had a look at this warning and there is really
mutex_lock_nested(). Sorry Alan!
David, I don't think a patch which causes such a warning can be merged
even to -mm, because, as I wrote earlier it would automatically turn
off lockdep for everybody. So, every such warning needs to be fixed or,
if it's impossible because of some lockdep deficiency, it should be
considered if it's better to wait for lockdep changes, or do the change
with lockdep turned off locally for each lock (IMHO, it's better,
because with sems there is no such control as well, and some other
aspects could be tested in the meantime).

Alan, you are 200% right! I apologize for my bad jokes too!
