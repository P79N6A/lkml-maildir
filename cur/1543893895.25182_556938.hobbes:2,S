Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think 50 markers couldn't ever 
result in a visible change:
You need a change that is big enough that it has a measurable influence 
on the cache hit ratio.
I don't think you could get any measurable influence unless you get into 
areas where > 10% of all code are conditional. And that's a percentage 
I wouldn't consider being realistically.
And one big disadvantage of your implementation is the dependency on 
MODULES. If you build all driver statically into the kernel, switching 
from CONFIG_MODULES=y to CONFIG_MODULES=n already gives you for free a 
functionally equivalent kernel that is smaller by at about 8% (depending 
on the .config).
My impression is that your patches would add an infrastructure for a 
nice sounding idea that will never have any real life effect.
