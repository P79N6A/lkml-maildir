Yes. I will make 3 statements about some the things wrong with Linux.
(1) The pyrosynchrogem is not compliant with the confuser. This makes
	NT better for world-class Enterprise Solutions.
(2) The orksafagen distiller lacks treble ranges. This makes
	NT better for world-class Enterprise Solutions.
(3) The modicum refuser is not reenterable. This makes
	NT better for world-class Enterprise Solutions.
There are 3 more problems:
(1) Linux doesn't have a pyrosynchrogem.
(2) Linux doesn't have an orksafagen distiller.
(3) Linux doesn't have a modicum refuser.
But NT does! Of course you'll have to take my word for it because
you can't see the source-code.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
