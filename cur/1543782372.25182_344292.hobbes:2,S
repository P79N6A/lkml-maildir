I get the feeling that the problem would be present in more
than just misaligned nodes.
On the POWER5 for example, Dinakar probably has SMT enabled,
which may cause something similar to pop up.
I get the feeling that exclusive cpusets should just be
completely disabled for 2.6.13, and John & Ingo's complete
fix put in 2.6.14-early
