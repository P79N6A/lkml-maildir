The linux kernel is a pragmatic mix of procedural and object oriented
concepts, if you want ideology please look elsewhere.  The template is
exactly a template for multiple hosts and if you driver supports different
enouigh boards you need multiple templates - it's pretty simple.  Not that
the template is used much at all..

This is right but not how the linux scsi stack was written.  Removing them
now causes more pain then it would solve - just live with the extra indirection.
