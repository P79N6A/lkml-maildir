Subject: [PATCH] Mark rwsem functions as __sched for wchan/profiling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  Hi,
  This following commit
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=fdf8cb0909b531f9ae8f9b9d7e4eb35ba3505f07
  un-inlined  a  low-level   rwsem  function,  but  did  not   mark  it  as
__sched. The  result is that  it now shows  up as thread wchan  (which also
affects  /proc/profile stats).  The  following simple  patch fixes  this by
properly marking rwsem_down_failed_common() as a __sched function.
  Also in  this patch,  which is up  for discussion, marks  down_read() and
down_write() proper as __sched. For profiling, it is pretty much useless to
know  that a  semaphore is  beig help  - it  is necessary  to  know _which_
one. By going  up another frame on the stack,  the information becomes much
more useful.
  In  summary, the  below  change  to lib/rwsem.c  should  be applied;  the
changes to  kernel/rwsem.c could be  applied if other kernel  hackers agree
with  my  proposal that  down_read()/down_write()  in  the  profile is  not
enough.
  Cheers,
			Livio
