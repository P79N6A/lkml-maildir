Please have a crack at ours:
http://www.progressive-comp.com/Lists/?l=linux-kernel&r=1&w=2#linux-kernel
Doing a quick search for 'sendfile' in linux-kernel turned up 264 hits.
Unfortunately, searching for 'sendfile eagain' found only three, and one
was your post :(  ...But maybe some variations will turn up more.
You may want to check linux-net as well.
