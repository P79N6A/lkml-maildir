I had an issue with the console initialisation on serial ports, which I
discovered during my PXA work.  My reason for asking about the kernel
versions (which Andrew forwarded to LKML) is to determine whether the
report is as a result of those changes, or lack of those changes.
Those -mm versions with git-arm in probably have that change.  Ergo
the importance to answer this question about kernel versions.
