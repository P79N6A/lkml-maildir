Linus,
could you please pull from 'for-linus' branch of
        master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jikos/hid.git for-linus
to receive fixes for HID core layer and USB HID layer. 
This update is needed to make the IOWarrior device driver (that got merged 
during merge 2.6.21 merge window) to work, as it is needed to blacklist it 
from being claimed by generic HID driver.
Thanks.
