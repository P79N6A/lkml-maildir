Your ping is broken. The varying byte(s) is/are  part of the timestamp but 
shouldn't be. This is a 64 Bit problem - on a 32 Bit machine (intel ...)
it works by luck :-).
I can send you my patch against ping-0.12 (netkit) if you wish. 
I also sent it to the netkit maintainer but didn't receive an answer yet.
Anyone knows whether he's alive or I have the wrong address 
<netbug@ftp.uk.linux.org> ?
It seems others have also fixed this but I don't remember where to find
those patches. Maybe even at RetHat?

Can't comment on that.
