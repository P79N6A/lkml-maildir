Yes, it really becomes a hierarchical problem once you consider user and 
processes. Top level sees a "user" can be scheduled (put itself on the 
virtual run queue), and passes the ball to the "process" scheduler inside 
the "user" container, down to maybe "threads". With all the "key" 
calculation parameters kept at each level (with up-propagation).
