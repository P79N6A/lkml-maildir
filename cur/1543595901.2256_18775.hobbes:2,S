Hi,
 first of all congratulations for finishing the initial first release.
Some questions, just out of curiosity:
>* Fast recovery after a system crash or power outage 
>
>* Journaling for file system integrity 
>
>* Journaling of meta-data only 
>
 does this mean JSF/Linux always journals only the meta-data, or is that
an option?
Does it perform full data-journaling under AIX?
>* Extent-based allocation 
>
>* Excellent overall performance 
>
>* 64 bit file system 
>
>* Built to scale. In memory and on-disk data structures are designed to 
>  scale beyond practical limit 
 Is this scaling only for size, or also for performance (many disks on
many controllers) like XFS (at least on SGI iron)?
Thanks
Martin
