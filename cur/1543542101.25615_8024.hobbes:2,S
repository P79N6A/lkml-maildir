Could, but is not. GIF and PNG have approximately the same functionality,  
with mostly these differences IIRC:
* GIF has thumbnail and animation support
* PNG is much better thought out and has a far more regular structure
* PNG has *far* better documentation (RFC 2083, for starters).
If anything, I'd say PNG is simpler.
