Fixable, except from guessing the root password which is hard.

And the only cure then is not make your linux fs accessible from
windows.  I.e. not on a disk for which windows have a driver
installed.  Preferably not the same computer.
Or simply "don't run untrusted executables under windows".  Do
so in linux only, where protection applies.  Do anybody ever
_need_ to run a program they got in the mail?
