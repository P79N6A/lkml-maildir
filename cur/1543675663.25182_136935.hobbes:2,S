This is wrong.
CONFIG_USB has always represented the master/host side ... while
CONFIG_USB_GADGET represents just the slave/gadget side.
The two are completely independent.  Hardware that supports
one will typically _not_ support the other.  And systems
that support the slave/gadget side will have no use at all
for the 100KB+ of "usbcore".
If you want CONFIG_USB_GADGET to depend on USB, then you're
going to need to change the meaning of CONFIG_USB so that it
becomes just an "umbrella" ... and change EVERYTHING that
currently depends on CONFIG_USB to depend on some new config
varaible representing just the host side (which also depends
on CONFIG_USB).  That sort of change seems pointless.
