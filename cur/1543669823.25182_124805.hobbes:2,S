Subject: dentry leak in 2.5.x

Seen on 2.5.65-mm3, updatedb got dentry + inode caches eating 740/768MB:
$ head /proc/sys/fs/*state
==> /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state <==
1192481 1194571 45      0       0       0
==> /proc/sys/fs/inode-state <==
1182447 49053   0       0       0       0       0
Then, after listening to it swap for a while (the screen stopped
unblanking) I saw the state of affairs unchanged by swapoff -a:
$ head /proc/sys/fs/*state
==> /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state <==
1192501 1194592 45      0       0       0
==> /proc/sys/fs/inode-state <==
1182451 49053   0       0       0       0       0
Followed by blind reboot via sysrq, nothing visible on VGA or remotely.
I suspect a leak (or something). nr_unused is greater than nr_dentry.
UP 600MHz K7 768MB RAM, Adaptec 39160, tulip + eepro, reiserfs, preempt.
