i don't see what all this argument is about -- the above may be a bit
vague, but it does only confirm what is obvious anyway -- if it's not
possible to provide a constant rate monotonic TSC then it should be
disabled. [the other solution (for the constant, but different on some
cpus case) is pset(), but even then, the default config should be tsc
disabled]

Actually, do your tsc really drift, or were you just speculating
earlier? I'd guess only the multiplier is different, but can't
verify this as i don't have such a setup...

It is a reasonable assumption. Expecting all apps to check for same
tsc rate on all cpus isn't.
