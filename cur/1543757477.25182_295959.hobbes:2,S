The problem is that often you don't know exactly how long the data set is
(think "backup burned to CD/RW") - there's a *lot* of code that does stuff
like
	while (actual=read(fd,buffer,65536) > 0) {
		...
	}
with the realistic expectation that the last read might return less than 64k,
in which case 'actual' will tell us how much was read.  Instead, we just get
an error on the read.
Note that 'dd' does this - that's why you get messages like '12343+1 blocks read'.
We *really* want to get to a point where 'dd' will work *without* having to
tell it a 'bs=' and 'count=' to get the size right....
