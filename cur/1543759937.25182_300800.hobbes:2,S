Possibly, but it would also use up that bit more space. That map could be
condensed to 3 bits but would make it that bit (no pun) more complex and
difficult to merge. On the other hand, it would be faster to use a char[]
as it would be an array-index lookup to get a pageblock type rather than a
number of bit operations.
So, it depends on what people know to be better in general because I have
not measured it to know for a fact. Is it better to use char[] and use
array indexes rather than bit operations or is it better to leave it as a
bitmap and condense it later when things have settled down?
