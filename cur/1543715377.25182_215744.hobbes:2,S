Subject: BUG: fork do not copy /proc/<PID>/cmdline permissions

I expected from fork to make a rather complete copy of a process,
but it does not copy /proc/<PID>/cmdline access permissions.
Therefore, the only way (at least i know) to hide all args of
processes is to start every program within shell script:
bash -c 'chmod /proc/$$/cmdline; exec userprogramm ...'
Tested on 2.6.5.
