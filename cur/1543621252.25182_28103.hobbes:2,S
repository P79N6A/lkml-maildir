I think your BUG patch is good and it should go in.
Also note that such BUG() cannot trigger in mainline, and this is not an
hope, we know this for sure. It cannot happen even with bttv, because
the bttv-driver in mainline is using remap_page_range and it doesn't
allow read/write zerocopy. Such BUG can trigger only if you patch
mainline or if you use drivers not part of the maineline kernel, so as
usual it's a matter of the driver maintainers to provide a driver that
functions correctly on top of a certain mainline kernel. So I really
wouldn't worry to change this for 2.4 (as said, unless/until we're
forced to ship aio on top of 2.4).
