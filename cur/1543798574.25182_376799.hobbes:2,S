I would like to mention another reason why we need to have a new 
GFP_CRITICAL flag for an allocation request. When we are in emergency,
even the GFP_KERNEL allocations for a critical socket should not 
sleep. This is because the swap device may have failed and we would
like to communicate this event to a management server over the 
critical socket so that it can initiate the failover.
We are not trying to solve swapping over network problem. It is much
simpler. The critical sockets are to be used only to send/receive
a few critical messages reliably during a short period of emergency.
Thanks
