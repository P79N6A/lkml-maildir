Did you actually do that? Starting Firefox over a 6 Mbit VPN takes about 3
minutes on a FAST machine. That´s not acceptable - our users want (almost)
immediate response to an application, to clicking and waiting 10 seconds
until the app is doing something.

Yes, this will start Firefox (as an example) down to 2 minutes 15 seconds
and put additional compression/decompression load on the system. We go for
AIP right now (Sun Secure Global Desktop), there you have the feeling as if
you were sitting in front of the box.
