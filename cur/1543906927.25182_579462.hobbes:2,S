FYI: There seem to be a very wide range of Turion machines affected by
the latest no_hz/time/clockevents changes.
Tim Gardner reported a hang while booting and also pointed to commit:
e9e2cdb412412326c4827fc78ba27f410d837e6e
In the thread: ACPI Regression on Dell E1501
http://marc.info/?t=118246118400004&r=1&w=2
I am also seeing the hang Tim reported with a Ferrari F5000
(AMD Turion(tm) 64 X2 Mobile Technology TL-60)
On this machine, the hang only occurs sporadically (about every third
time). It seems, once it could pass a critical init section all is fine?
Hope that helps in some way...
