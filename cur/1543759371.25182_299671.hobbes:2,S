[PATCH] PCI Hotplug: Remove unneeded instructions from ibmphp_pci.c
this patch removes some unneeded code from ibmphp_pci.c. First I thought it
is a bug and the second line should have been "sec_no = (int) sec_number".
But than I found exactly the same read only 9 lines higher and after it the
line I expected the second one to be. Between the 2 pci_bus_read_config_byte's
are only some checks so I don't expect them to return different results. And
sec_no is and int so removing this wont change anything at all.
