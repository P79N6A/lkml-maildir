Well, you are right. I do understand how electrons travel through the slot 
lead, I can even read/write in C/assembly but I have no idea how PCI nor 
USB buses work. To say truth, I don't really care. If they do, that is... 
But I can type whatever you ask and can report what I see. Do you need a 
monkey? Try us :-)
