Yes, it's spun down at boot. I'll get the logs with the timestamps and
the results of the mdelay() incrementing in the morning when I've got the
board handy again.

The detection is simply flaky after that point, however before the
current master it never hit the 35 second point (and thus never implied
that the link was down). I'll double check the bisect log to see if there
was anything beyond that that may have caused it.
The -ENODEV at least implies that the SRST fails, so at least that's a
starting point.
One other curious thing is that it seems to misreport the IRQ. In this
case the log indicates 0, whereas it's actually on IRQ 66. When the
system is booted, /proc/interrupts reflects that sata_sil is on the
proper IRQ (even when it's reported as 0 in the boot printk()).
