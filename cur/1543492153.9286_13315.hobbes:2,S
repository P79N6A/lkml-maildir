^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I never edited this one, no clue what it does.
Have a look in /var/log/boot.msg or watch your console while booting:
Are both processors detected? Do the processors have the same Bogo Mips?
After startup, type 'uname -a' to be sure you are running the right
kernel
version (so you see the compile time of your kernel).
