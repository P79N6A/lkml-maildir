This means the mounted filesystem has to have mechanisms to check if
something has been changed beneath it, the block device drivers have to
agree on using the same buffer cache (or keeping them in sync), etc. Bloat
and performance loss for something that is done once in a blue moon (you
aren't installing new kernels several times per second, are you?). In this
case, making life a bit more difficult for writers of bootloaders for the
sake of making the rest go fast is entirely justified.
