Me too.
Different programs though; X is fine, gcc is fine, xemacs is fine. The
things that triggered it for me are nnrpd (innd itself is fine) and
/usr/bin/netscape -- not netscape itself but the wrapper shell script
(from the RedHat 6.1 netscape-common-4.61-12 RPM). But other shell
scripts run without problems. Very odd.

Dual PPro machine.

strace showed that the SIGSEGV seems to follow an sbrk. If it is
related to memory allocation behaviour, that could explain why one
shell script can trigger it but not another.
