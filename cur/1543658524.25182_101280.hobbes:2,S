Aha, this makes a lot of sense. Then the leftover files I am getting are
probably a product of:
syslog:Jan  7 08:35:47 canario rpc.statd[101]: Received erroneous SM_UNMON request from canario for 192.168.99.4
syslog:Jan  7 09:09:37 canario rpc.statd[101]: Received erroneous SM_UNMON request from canario for 192.168.99.4
syslog:Jan  7 18:23:15 canario rpc.statd[101]: Received erroneous SM_UNMON request from canario for 192.168.99.4
It seems that rpc.statd itself isn't liking the request it's getting and
never forwards it to the server. I used to think these were harmless,
but now I wonder why would this be happening?

But at least it seems that nobody has crashed - statd is running along
fine. Both server and clients run the same versions of the daemon, and
the fact that we get repeated messages (without restarting anybody)
should indicate that it is in fact running. 
Take care,
