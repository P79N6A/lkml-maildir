Sorry, I'm pretty well full up on time I can allocate to figuring out this
cleanup stuff, for the next week or two anyway.  I'm very glad you're doing
it, but I don't think we can resolve the exec area all in one push now.
I don't have anything to contradict your plan about cleaning up exec.
But I'm just not able to devote enough time right now to giving it the full
consideration it requires.
Thanks,
Roland
