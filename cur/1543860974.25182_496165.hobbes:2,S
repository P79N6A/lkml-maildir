    Machine passes memtest without fail, even after running for many
hours.
    Since the problem looked genuine to me and may hit again in future
do let me know how I should improve the patch. Please let us know of the
opinion...
---------------------------------------------------------------------
To restate the problem:
Data access error was observed after testing IO and TCP Stress test for
more than 72 hrs over ppc-64 machine.

The location of the problem was 
-----------
for (i = open_files; i != 0; i--) {
                struct file *f = *old_fds++;
                if (f) {
                        get_file(f); <== Get file does increment of f_count of 
     
                                         struct file
                } else {
-----------
in kernel/fork.c.Accessing f_count gives Data access error as 'struct file' pointer f is 
pointing to invalid location
