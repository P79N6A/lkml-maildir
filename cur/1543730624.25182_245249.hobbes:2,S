Ah, I think the bug is here.  avc_search_node() can return a node that
matches the (ssid,tsid,tclass) triple but doesn't include all of the
necessary decisions (the decided vector), but your avc_lookup() code
falls through nonetheless and returns it.  This happens normally during
initialization prior to policy load, where security_compute_av is only
adding decisions as they are requested.  Notice that the original code
set rc to ENOENT on that path; in your case, you need to reset node to
NULL.
