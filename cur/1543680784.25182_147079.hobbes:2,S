This isn't really an example of the sort of thing I was asking about.  I
was referring specifically to kernel code, not general-purpose userspace C
library routines like sscanf.
But maybe you mean the kernel's internal implementation of sscanf.  If 
someone in the kernel did write "sscanf(0,0);" then that would definitely 
be an error in the source.  It should be brought to the author's attention 
as soon as possible, and a segfault (or BUG_ON) is a much more effective 
way of doing so than simply returning -1.

Okay, but there's no way at the source level to protect against all kinds
of events like alpha particles changing a stored value.  And what's the
point in checking just _some_ of them in the source if you're going to
have to check _all_ of them at a lower (hardware) level anyway?

I don't understand that comment.

But the kernel already provides a utility for handling exceptions and has 
a fairly fixed design.  The extent to which one writes exception checks of 
dubious value is indeed a stylistic issue, at least in this one setting.
