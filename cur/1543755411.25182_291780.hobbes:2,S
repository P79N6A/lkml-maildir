We have to do *something*.  We can't just throw away writes.
I see a few options:
 - Log all pending writes to config space and replay the log when the
   device is unblocked.
 - Fail writes to config space while the device is blocked.
 - Write to the saved config space and then blat the saved config space
   back to the device upon unblocking.
Any other ideas?
BTW, you know things like XFree86 go completely around the kernel's PCI
accessors and poke at config space directly?
