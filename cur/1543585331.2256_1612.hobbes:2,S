An update... driver version 1e08 (stupid version number... 1.08e?) works,
but only on a 2.2.x kernel (2.2.18)  1e08 dosn't play nicely with 2.4.x
PCI scanning... compiles but never gets run.
I believe this is the version sent to RedHat.  Anyway, I can live with this,
since this particular box is single-CPU.  I'll have a SMP configuration on
another machine soon, though.
This box is available for another day or so for experimentation, before I wipe
the drive and do a final install.  If anyone has any ideas let me know now.
I can even give root level access to it for the moment. (again, it's getting
wiped in 48 hours)
