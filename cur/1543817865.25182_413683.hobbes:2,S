Because "struct device" generally is not related to a major:minor pair
at all.  That is what a struct class_device is for.  Lots of struct
device users have nothing to do with a char device, and some have
multiple char devices associated with a single struct device.
You need to create a struct class_device in order to export the proper
information to userspace so that udev and other tools can pick up the
fact that your device is present and it needs to create a device for it.
All that being said, yes, there is a disconnect between the driver model
parts and the char subsystem.  It's been something that I've wanted to
fix for a number of years, but never had the time to do so.  If you want
to work toward doing this, I'd be glad to review any patches.
thanks,
