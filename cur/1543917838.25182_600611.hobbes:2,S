Just a bit more details about hardware:
Sun Fire X4100 (AMD Opteron 252), chipset looks like AMD-8111/AMD-8131 chips.
There is no HPET detected, and by default acpi_pm used, which is seems more 
CPU intensive(based on oprofile results) than TSC. Choosing TSC over /sys 
doesn't make much difference.
Workload is http requests coming from customers, noticeable slowdown 
happening on >250 requests/second, then routed to squid, then marked at squid 
ToS and depends on ToS routed over netfilter to required TCP port. At 
required TCP port "satellite accelerator" intercepting connection (so it is 
loopback, and it means "double" tcp work), and encapsulate stuff to UDP. Sure 
receiving UDP (stream around 10-20Mbit/s), and decapsulating ... and same way 
but in reverse to customer. So summary:
2x Opteron 2.4 Ghz
Processing incoming TCP requests rate 250-500 req/s
Incoming TCP bandwidth around 3-5 Mbit/s
Outgoing TCP bandwidth around 33-35Mbit/s 
Internally routed TCP also around this number (-cached content)
Incoming UDP bandwidth arounn 20-25Mbit/s
Outgoing UDP bandwidth around 500Kbit/s
At 2x Dual Core Opteron 2.6 Ghz (means total 4 cores) and similar load i 
cannot notice big slowdown, so it is noticable only when hardware used nearby 
it's limits i think. BUT! I can notice in mpstat spikes of softirq, from 
normal value 7-8% to 50-60%, but it didn't cause any noticeable slowdown on 
ssh or system operations. I am expecting 2.6.21 to serve 600-700 req/s. Maybe 
there is some additional overhead in this calculations, or improper irq 
locking? I am not guru in such stuff.
I guess who have similar workload can check mpstat 1, and see if there is 
spikes in soft% or not.
