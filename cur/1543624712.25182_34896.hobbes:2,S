gcc 3.1 volatile behavior changes, so, yes, it is...

Cool... just checking.  Both RX_BUF_SIZE and REAL_RX_BUF_SIZE are defined as
    foo + magic_number
so I wasn't sure if the alignment space was -already- accounted for, in 
the definition of RX_BUF_SIZE, thus making the addition op next to 
allocations of REAL_RX_BUF_SIZE superfluous.  But, I stand corrected, 
thanks.

More than just api updates... You have a bunch of hack-y logic for when 
the link goes down and up, messing around with netif_stop_queue and 
netif_wake_queue.  That stuff will be simplified or simply go away.  The 
basic idea is, if netif_carrier_ok(dev) is not true, then the net stack 
will not be sending you any packets.  So those extra 
netif_{stop,wake}_queue calls are superflouous.
We're also about to start sending link up/down messages async-ly via 
netlink, so that's even more added value as well.

Cool.  As FYI (_not_ advice on your driver), here's the logic I was 
referring to:
    dev->hard_start_xmit()
        if (free slots < MAX_SKB_FRAGS)
            BUG()
        queue packet
        if (free slots < MAX_SKB_FRAGS)
            netif_stop_queue(dev)
    foo_interrupt()
        if (some tx interrupt)
            complete as many TX's as possible
            if (netif_queue_stopped && (free slots > (TX_RING_SIZE / 4)))
                netif_wake_queue(dev)
But as long as your TX interrupts are well mitigated (and it sounds like 
they are), you can get by with your current scheme just fine.
