The simple fix, no...
However I have started to make a patch for ax25 to use sock_orphan, but
recently we had some trouble with 2.4 kernels that might be related to my
changes or the scc driver, so I am now looking at fixing that, as soon as
that is sorted out I will submit a patch that fixes it the right way.
