Thanks for all the help, I have contacted Intel with this information and 
I am going to try and get an update today, I may also try that mem= 
parameter with 'almost 8gb' sometime as well.
Is this typical for Intel motherboards?  Do AMD motherboards fair any 
better?  Curious for any user reports of people using 8GB on desktop 
boards..?
