Dear Erik & all,
Sorry for the delay in my latest updates. 
I was required to fix the partition problem first.
I have an update in gathering some partition info about in SD cards
formatted in windows and Camera.
I tried printing data from the ox1BE offset of 0th sector on windows
formatted SD card and Camera formatted SD card.
Please see the details below.
Windows SD_0_Sector details at 0x1BE offset
------------------------------------------
bootable 		= 111 	  ( 0x01BE)
beg-chs.heads 	= 116			.
beg-chs.sect 	= 104			.
beg-chs.cylin 	= 101			.
sys-type 		= 114			.
end-chs.heads 	= 32			.
end-chs.sect 	= 109			.
end-chs.cylin 	= 101			.
start sect  	= 778135908		.
n/o sec in part = 1141509631		.
Camera SD_0_Sector details at 0x1BE offset
------------------------------------------
bootable 		= 128
beg-chs.heads 	= 1
beg-chs.sect 	= 26
beg-chs.cylin 	= 0
sys-type 		= 1
end-chs.heads 	= 1
end-chs.sect 	= 96
end-chs.cylin 	= 193
start sect  	= 57
n/o sec in part = 28743
To the surprise of me, the windows partition table data looks corrupted
and the camera created partition table looks tome meaningful. But,
windows SD card mounts and camera SD card fails to mount.
I am planning to get the FAT12 details from the first partition of
camera starting at sector 57 as you can see in the 'start sect'
variable.
Please help me finding a way to fix this.
Thanks & Regards,
Mukund Jampala
