Hi,
Fairsched is a hierarchical fair CPU scheduler. Processes are divided
into groups and each group receives guaranteed CPU time allocation
proportional to its weight. The standard scheduler is used to schedule
processes within a group. It can be used to divide CPU time fairly
among users or for more flexible CPU time allocation on busy compute
servers. Kernel patch, documentation and a testing utility can be
found at:
http://fairsched.sourceforge.net/
New since v0.40:
- email address change
- more sensible handling of suspend events
- used new power management infrastructure
- added syscalls for s390
- fixed ia32 syscall numbers on ia64
- ported to 2.4.0-test3, syscall numbers changed on ia64, mips, mips64
Regards,
Borislav
