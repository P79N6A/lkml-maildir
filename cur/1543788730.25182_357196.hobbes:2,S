I think it will take rather long to synchronize all archs. Maybe x86 can
fix it fast (it would ease the making of LiveCD's) and then initiate a
standardization on lkml? Knoppix has its kernel patch for over a year
now and I asked gentoo to do so, too. But they said, I should ask for it
here... Until the fix is in the distributions-kernel, probably another
month will pass and it obviously needs to be fixed.
