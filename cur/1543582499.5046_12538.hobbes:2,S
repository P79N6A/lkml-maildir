What if you have a gig of buffer cache in the system?  You still need
to maintain the single LRU, so you're not going to be saving that much
on the main codepaths, and walking a gig of unnecessary buffer_heads
every kupdate() flush is not going to be cheap.

Yep, this behaviour on the superblock and group descriptors has hurt
people in the past.
