all 4 UIDs
all 64 signals
misc. VM stats (maybe)

sizeof(long) is 4 or 8
the struct is several hundred bytes on 64-bit hardware
shifting by 8 would allow for a terabyte of kernel memory

There wouldn't be a need to keep track of all read clone tags if the
kernel would group processes by clone tag. Then 'ps' would only need
to remember the current clone tag and the accumulated info.

Avoiding the "thread" and "process" terms here:
The above would do. When 'ps' looks at a task, 'ps' must be able to
determine if the task should be grouped with the previous or next one.
That, and the partial ordering implied, would be enough to collect
tasks into groups. I don't expect much trouble selecting the leader,
since I have the "PPid" (parent TASK identifier!) value.

I don't know. Ask on the linux-cluster list.
