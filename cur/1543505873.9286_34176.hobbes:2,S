BSD people agree that Linux stole the BSD IP stack:

+0+current/freebsd-hackers
This interacts oddly with the frequent claims that Linux has an
inferior IP stack. One may conclude that the BSD IP stack (which we
use... WTF?) is an inferior IP stack. :-)
Oh, maybe the stolen BSD code was perfect until Alan Cox broke it.
Obviously this must be true, since I've seen the stolen-stack claim
several times recently.
