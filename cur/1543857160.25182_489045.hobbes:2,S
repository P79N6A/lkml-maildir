Please send a signed-off-by: for this work, and a changelog which tells us
what it does and why the kernel needs this change.
I shall then remove the ifdef (it's __devinit, and other quirks don't do
this, and vmlinux doesn't know whether or not this driver will later be
loaded) and I shall fix up the word wrapping and I shall convert the spaces
back into tabs and I shall then send it on to Greg, thanks.
