I just tested this with oprofile both built into the kernel and as a
module, and with oprofile userspace tools 0.9.1 and from CVS.  No
change.  I have verified that /dev/oprofile is mounted.  It looks like
the profiler never sees any samples.
rlrevell@mindpipe:~$ cat /dev/oprofile/stats/cpu0/sample_received 
0
Could one of the ktimers changes have broken the timer interrupt based
profiling?
