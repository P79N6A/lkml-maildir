Couldn't have put that any better. On mission-critical systems, this is
exactly what people do. Personally, my experience is from the big-iron
world of S390 -  if you're a bleeding-edge organisation, you'll be out
there applying the latest PTFs, you'll be running the latest OS/390 etc. 
If you're conservative, you're at least 2, maybe 3 releases (in todays 
OS390 this means about 18-24 months) behind. If you're ultra-conservative,
you'll wait for the point where you can no longer avoid an upgrade.
