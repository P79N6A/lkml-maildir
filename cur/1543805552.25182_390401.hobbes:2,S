Subject: [patch 0/4] net: Percpufy frequently used variables on struct proto
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/26/205

The following patches change struct proto.memory_allocated,
proto.sockets_allocated to use per-cpu counters. This patchset also switches
the proto.inuse percpu varible to use alloc_percpu, instead of NR_CPUS *
cacheline size padding.
We saw 5 % improvement in apache bench requests per second with this
patchset, on a multi nic 8 way 3.3 GHZ IBM x460 Xeon server.  
Patches follow.
Thanks,
Kiran
