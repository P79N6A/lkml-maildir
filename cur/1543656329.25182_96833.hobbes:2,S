Hi!
It was and is still strange when reading this, but
from linux/security/root_plug.c:
[...]
 * Prevents any programs running with egid == 0 if a specific USB device
   ^^^^^^^^
 * is not present in the system.  Yes, it can be gotten around, but is a
      ^^^^^^^^^^^
from linux/security/Kconfig
[...]
	  This is a sample LSM module that should only be used as such.
	  It enables control over processes being created by root users
	     ^^^^^^^
	  if a specific USB device is not present in the system.
	                              ^^^
I thinks, that "not" should not be in Kconfig.
BYtE
Philipp
