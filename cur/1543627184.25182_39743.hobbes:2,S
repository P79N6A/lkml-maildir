Subject: Full RAM problem with IDE UDMA active

Helo,
When I do varios disk read-write operations (ex.: copying some ISO from one 
partition to another), my RAM gets almost FULL. It keeps growing in usage 
during the read-write operation. But when the operation finishes, the memory 
keeps FULL, even after running a sync command. The swap isn't used in 
this case.
I think that UDMA uses a lot of memory without deallocing it.
Look:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        772368     645884     126484          0      85072     393896
-/+ buffers/cache:     166916     605452
Swap:      1044188          0    1044188
I'm a newbie on kernel development, but I think that must be something 
related with the Linux kernel because I've tested a lot, in Slackware 8.0 and 
on my Linux-From-Scratch distro (I'm using now).
I compared to other OS and Linux is the only that does that, so it's not 
ahardware problem.
My computer is a:
Intem Pentium 3 EB 800Mhz
MB ASUS CUV4X - BIOS 1009 
Chipset: VIA Apollo Pro133X - NB: VT82C694Z - SB: VT82C686A
768MB DIMM RAM PC133
HD Quantum lct30 (30GB - 5400 RPM)
etc...
Essential Softz 
Kernel Linux-2.4.18
GlibC 2.2.5
GCC 3.0.4
The .config of my kernel is attached to this email.
Please, help me to solve this.
Regards,
Herbert[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
