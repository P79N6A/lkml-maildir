I'm not sure what you mean. I fetched the branch I think you referred to 
[1], but when I did a merge of that on top of v2.6.23-rc8-mm2 I 
got "Already up-to-date", so AFAICT that branch is fully merged into mm and 
I'm already running with you latest code...
Please correct me if I'm doing anything wrong.
