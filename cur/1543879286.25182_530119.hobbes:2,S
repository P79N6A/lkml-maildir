You can pack them a little differently and they'll shrink a lot.
Firstly store
		start, size
Secondly pack the offset as 16 bit with the top 4 bits
		0-3 value
		4 - F
		5 - 1D
		6 - E0
And the size as an 8 bit range. You need to open code the rule for 
20000/30000 but that is tiny anyway.
Unpack is trivial
	start = (toptab[*entry>>4]|(*entry&0x0F)) << 8 | entry[1];
	end = start + entry[2];
