And that was part of my point. Every time I got in a debate on lkml
regarding ltt, there were crowds screaming in horror at the possibility
of trace points everywhere.

I agree entirely.

I think we're in full agreement. A solid kernel instrumentation mechanism
is exactly what is needed. The whole point of posting the ltt stuff on
the lkml is exactly to get the best technical solution. The ltt developers
are more than happy to take suggestions as to how to achieve this.
