Hmm, maybe not.  We should be able to unlock the page just after
removing it from the page cache.
By the way, the wait_on_page in lock_page is where we finally get
around for waiting on those locked pages we couldn't get rid of
in invalidate_inode_pages; what we have done here is shifted the
wait from rpciod to normal users, which is exactly what we want.
