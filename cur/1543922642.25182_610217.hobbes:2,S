Well, two main questions...
Is this warning of value to anybody but you?
Is this information worth printing out on everyone else's kernel build?
If yes, great!  But it sounds like this warning is analagous to
   #warning willy's TODO list: get milk, buy groceries, read email, ...
which doesn't add much value to others' kernel builds :)
