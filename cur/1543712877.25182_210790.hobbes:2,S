Yes.  This is true.  This is consistent with the preallocation behaviour of
shared memory segments, but inconsistent with the behaviour of mmap'ing
/dev/zero which it essentially emulates.  This is not trival to fix as we
do not get informed when the unmap occurs.  Accounting for normal pages is
handled directly by the VM unmap code.  I think I have found a way to track
these but it does blur the interfaces between the hugetlbfs and hugepage
implementations.
There are a number of other 'bugs' in the implementation of hugetlb.  For
example, the MAP_SHARED/MAP_PRIVATE flags are ignored, behaviour is
identical in both cases.

True, this needs work on the interface to the quota system in hugetlbfs.
We essentially need to check the quota before we attempt to fault any
pages.  I'll change it around see how it looks.
Expect new patches tomorrow ...
