cc list trimmed.  Nobody has come up with a "must have" reason for
get_module_symbol and that interface is broken as designed.  I will be
adding generic inter-object registration code and removing all vestiges
of get_module_symbol this weekend.  The inter-object registration code
will allow two objects to pass data to each other, it will not matter
whether the objects are both modules, one module and one built in (in
either order) or both built in.  When modules are involved there will
be full module locking.
