None at the moment, so getting this applied isn't neccesarily a high
priority.  Actually, the only in-tree caller is fs/exec.c:do_coredump.
I'm currently working on writing a new autofs stack and will eventually
~ need this call exported.  It seems strange to me that we'd only export
portions of an api like this.
