Hi!
When I read from a CD-ROM and play music at the same time, my computer
deadlocks after some time. There is no output to syslog; the system
just freezes (no mouse or keyboard response), and I'll have to reboot.
Copying the entire CD to a local HD causes no problems; playing the
freshly copied music (MP3s) from the HD likewise.
The CD-ROM is connected to an AHA-1542 SCSI adapter, the soundcard is
a GUS MAX.
The computer is an old P90 with 32MB RAM. 2.2.2 also deadlocks in the
same way.
I'll be glad to provide more information upon request.
