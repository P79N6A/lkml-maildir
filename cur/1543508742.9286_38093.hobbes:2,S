Hmmm... let me thing about this over the weekend.  You have just given me
a few ideas (good or bad, I don't know, yet).  There are some good papers
on implementing sets (the mathematical kind) efficiently.
Some people have done similar things: one of Gaurav (the USENIX99 paper
author about event queues) other ideas was to use use a two level bitmap
for file descriptor allocation.  This two level bitmap is very common in
many other application (actually, where I work, Ask Jeeves, we use it
to maintain a list of matching questions).  I think that there are many
other ideas that can be transplanted here.
Thanks for the input
