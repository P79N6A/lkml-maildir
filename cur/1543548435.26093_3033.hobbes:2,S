No, wasn't my point.  Sorry if it came out that way.  My point was for
anyone reading not to jump to conclusions based on just those numbers, and
that I'd like to see some real-world tests on comparable systems.

This is an interesting point.  As far as changes are concerned, it should
have lower network utilization.  However, in effect, it does compare the
files.  It compared the file when you checked it into your local
repository.  It's just shifting the burden of the comparison to a local
repository instead of doing it over the network.  Faster, yes, but it
still does the same thing, just in a different way that uses less
bandwidth.
Later,
