I just downloaded the Linux gazette, all of the targz files at
the lg ftp site, and proceeded to untar them.  It is taking
forever for EACH file to untar.  When I say each file, I don't
mean each tarball, but rather each file IN the tarball.
I just thought I'd post this since I remember seeing somehting
about slow tar speed somewhere before too.
Other than this one slow thing, 2.2.0 *FLIES* on my machine,
everything works fairly well, and is much more responsive
IMHO.  Good work everyone!
