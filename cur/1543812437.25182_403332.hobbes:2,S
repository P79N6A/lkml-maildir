Nope, that's a big fat bug.
I need to reconsider the nanosecond tracking a bit anyway.  I was too
quick on the draw with the granularity change.  It doesn't do what the
original does, and won't work at all when interrupts become tasks.
To do this properly, I need to maintain separate tick hit count (a.k.a.
time_slice;) and run_time.  If I had slice_info in the first patch, I
could store granularity there and not have to add anything to the task
struct, but alas...
