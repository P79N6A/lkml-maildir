Hmm...everything else in lib/Kconfig is supposed to be _selected_, not
depended upon. And the only three items in there which can actually be
selected by the user all begin their helptexts with
"This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree modules
require FOO functions".
Are you sure it's a good idea to break with existing practice? I'm
concerned that nobody will ever find the JFFS2_LZO option if it means
they will have to go all the way down to the "Library functions" menu
and select something to make the option visible...
