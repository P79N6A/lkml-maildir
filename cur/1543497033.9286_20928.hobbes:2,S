I haven't had the oppourtunity to test the patch just yet becuase my
computer is stupid and on my Red Hat 6.0 box, it seems that I can't get
any other 2.2.x kernel to boot other than the Red Hat 2.2.5-15.  IMHO,
that kinda sucks.  I'm running 2.3.3 right now, and I am not having any
problems, but any other 2.2.x kernels yield the LILO error message "No
setup signature found...".
