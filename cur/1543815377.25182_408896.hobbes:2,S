Doing this from kernelspace is wrong.  It should be done from userspace,
best using a systemcall. Of couse the handlers can't work as-is you'd
need to redo that to work similarlt to ptrace - which will hopefully
allow some code reuse aswell.
And please - independent of the best api in this case - please don't ever
submit large amounts of code again that don't have any in-tree user.
