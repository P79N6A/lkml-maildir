Actually, that particular ifdef ARCH_APICTIMER_STOPS_ON_C3 is always set for
i386 and x86-64 and local APIC is enabled. I only added that ifdef to skip 
this code for IA-64, which can also use acpi processor_idle.c.
For any other CPU in i386 or x86-64, we can just add runtime check along with
VENDOR_INTEL.
