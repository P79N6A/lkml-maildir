Hello,
according to the relayfs description on opersys.com,
|As the Linux kernel matures, there is an ever increasing number of facilities
|and tools that need to relay large amounts of data from kernel space to user
|space. Up to this point, each of these has had its own mechanism for relaying
|data. To supersede the individual mechanisms, we introduce the "high-speed
|data relay filesystem" (relayfs). As such, things like LTT, printk, EVLog,
|etc.
This sounds to me like it would obsolete most character-based devices, e.g.
random and urandom.
What do the relayfs developers say to this?
