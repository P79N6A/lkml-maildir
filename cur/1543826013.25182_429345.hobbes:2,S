It's only dependent_sleeper that is being converted in these patches. The 
wake_sleeping_dependent component still locks all runqueues and needs to 
succeed in order to ensure a task doesn't keep sleeping indefinitely. That 
one doesn't get called from schedule() so is far less expensive. This means I 
don't think we can change that cpu based locking order which I believe was 
introduce to prevent a deadlock (?DaveJ disovered it iirc).
