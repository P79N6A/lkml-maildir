The problem is that many drivers allocate memory on the fly, not just
allocate at load and hold it. So even sound drivers that are compiled into
the kernel can fail when trying to grab dma memory. So all drivers would
have to change to grabbing and holding ram rather than dynamic.
Probably the 'reserve Xmb below 16mb for dma memory' is the best solution.
eg in lilo.conf something like
   append = "dmaram=2m"
