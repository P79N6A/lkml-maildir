Hi Jeff,
I still haven't got a reply from lkml, but an JMicron employee contacted me 
and told me how to get this working:

Unfortunately my kernel knowledge is next to none, so I cannot implement this. 
But I guess it should be easy for you or anyone else having done similar. The 
employee actually told me that he mailed above to you, so was it just lack of 
time, you didn't made a quirk or any other reason?
Cheers,
