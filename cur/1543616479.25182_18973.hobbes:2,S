Well, my A7V is also acting up, with spurious IRQs (but not too many), and
PCI lockups if the load on the PCI bus increases too much -- this is
probably the last time I ever buy a VIA board (because they take soooo much
time to acknowledge their screw ups and help people fix it) unless they
start issuing non-binary-only fixes (heck, all it takes is a doc telling us
what to do on the PCI registers!).
The IDE corruption and lockups you can fix, just apply the latest IDE
patches, the 2.4.18pre IDE subsystem is not to be used on a KT133, it will
not work at all if you give it a slightly bigger load on the promise
controller, for example.

Without the IDE patches, it will (most probably) not help.
