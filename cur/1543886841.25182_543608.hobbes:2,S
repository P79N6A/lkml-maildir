I need to put it in some permanent place, but basically the problem is
that if you need to shut the kernel up by using an empty function for a
release, then you are not understanding why the kernel was trying to
warn you in the first place :(
You need to free your memory for the class_device in the release
function, you can not have a static structure, or rely on some other
reference count to handle the cleanup properly.
Also note that 'struct class_device' is going away and you should use
'struct device' instead.  That too needs to be documented better, and is
on my list of things to do...
thanks,
