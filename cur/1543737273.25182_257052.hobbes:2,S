Hi Marcelo,
Seems like a good idea... even with regular dumb kswapd "merging",
you may easily get stuck for example on systems without swap...
Anyway, I'd like to get those beat kswapd patches in first. Then
your mechanism just becomes something like:
    if order-0 pages are low {
        try to free memory
    }
    else if order-1 or higher pages are low {
         try to coalesce_memory
         if that fails, try to free memory
    }
