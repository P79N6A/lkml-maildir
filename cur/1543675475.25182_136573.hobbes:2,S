I think you missed the point entirely before. 2.4.21 CANNOT cause
regressions most of all. At this point there is no way to know if the
thing that fixes your machine breaks on 100s others that DO work
correctly in 2.4.20. Even if it would fix 100s and break 1 it's still
not acceptable for stable kernel releases.
