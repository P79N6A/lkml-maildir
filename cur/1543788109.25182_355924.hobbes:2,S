And what about kexec?  To be able to boot into another kernel on a kernel
bug and still have access to all the memory and the system state of the
bug.  That's pretty cool.  It would be like Windows going straight to
Safe-Mode on a BSOFD without a reboot.

I've been thinking of at least trying to see what would happen if I
threaded the do_initcalls in main.c but lately I haven't had the time.
