Note we already removed 99% of compatibility code, but the remaining 
pieces are very difficult to solve with C preprocesor. I know that you 
do not care about older kernels, but we have good reasons to share code.
It very simplifies maintaince.
Please, let us to remove this compatibility stuff. I will probably use 
one more level of preprocessing to keep the compatibility in our build 
tree.
