My desktop running rc2aa1 crashed in lo_send a few minutes ago while
testing oom conditions with simultaneous heavy I/O to the loop device,
so I had a chance to fix another bug. Maybe this is what you
experienced, but I also got an oops (maybe you didn't seen the oops
because the machine hanged up?). Just guessing.
Anyways here the fix (untested as usual :)

explanation: grab_cache_page must definitely return NULL in case of oom,
that's the API used by the callers. find_or_create_page can use the same
API as well (there's no point for the ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM) complication).
