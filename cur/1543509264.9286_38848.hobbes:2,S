Just a set of data and status registers really.  See drivers/char/pc_keyb.c, 
or the RiscPC keyboard driver for another way of doing things (the Acorn 
hardware provides its own PS/2 interface).

That should be fine.  The IDE driver can already share interrupts; not sure 
about the keyboard driver but it could be taught to do so easily enough.
