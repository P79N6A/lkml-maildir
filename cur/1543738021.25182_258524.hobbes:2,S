No its one I've seen a lot there and it turns out having dug into docs
and consulted the serial people in pointy hats that it is RS232
half-duplex mode which is one of those bits of the spec nobody ever
uses.
In this mode the DTE end (host normally) asserts RTS to request 
transmit access to the link. The DCE asserts CTS to indicate it has
finished sending bits, and the DTE then transmits.
RTS is a direction selector (RTS = 0, DCE transmit) (RTS = 1, DTE
transmit). CTS acts as the handshake to deal with the link turn around.
So that makes this much more useful.
