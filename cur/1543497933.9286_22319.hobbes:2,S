     You are right, but lets see; presumed 1 clock per bundle (or
   multiple bundles) means the instruction stream must be at least 16
   bytes wide, and if two bundles at the time are to be executed, 32
   byte memory read width is needed.  Gee, that is quite a monster..
   Of course having wide cache-cpu bus does not mandate as wide
   main-memory interface.
Correct, and even dumb UltraSparc provides similar bandwidth.
UltraSparc can inject 16-bytes per clock into the instruction
prefetcher, which equals or exceeds the bandwidth of the pipeline
(which is 4x4byte instructions max dispatched per clock).
I am sure they will tune EPIC chips in a similar manner, such that
instruction cache bandwidth on hits is enough to prevent dispatch
starvation.
Thus, if the UltraSparc I-cache has been pushing 16bytes per clock for
a few years now, I am very sure 32bytes per clock from some cpu vendor
is just around the corner. :-)
