They work on it themselves.

Unfortunately, I don't think you'll get it. It doesn't even seem like
they want to tell OpenSound how to do a binary-only driver...

No. If you just compile the kernel yourself, with
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=n, generic sound support and add this
****************************************
alias sound emu10k1
# pre-install emu10k1 insmod soundcore
post-remove emu10k1 rmmod soundcore
options emu10k1 -f
****************************************
to your conf.modules, it should work.
