ah, sorry for being a slow starter, i missed that bit - merge window 
attention span troubles ...
I think the kernel_locked() check added here is plain buggy against IRQ 
contexts: we drop the BKL spinlock and reduce current->kernel_depth 
non-atomically.
So kernel_locked() can become detached from the preempt_count().
Nick, can you think of any better way of still saving this debug check, or 
should we revert it?
Although it seems a bit weird how consistently you seem to be able to 
trigger it - as this seems to be a narrow race. Is there an IRQ storm 
there perhaps, or something widens things up for Qemu to inject an IRQ 
right there?
