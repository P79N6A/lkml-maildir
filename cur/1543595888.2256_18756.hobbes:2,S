I'll probably benchmark raw vs. non-raw I/O with Sybase ASE 12.5
on our application once we've come up to speed on basic performance
issues (we're database newbies).

Haven't seen Sybase talk about O_DIRECT.  Not sure we want to
pony up the Sybase license fees.  (I'm still in denial about
databases in general, and hope I can switch to PostgreSQL
at some point.)
BTW, 
http://eval.veritas.com/webfiles/whitepapers/sybaseedition/sybase14_performance_paper.pdf
seems to show that raw beats O_DIRECT hands down on Solaris.
Will that hold on Linux, or is your (forthcoming?) O_DIRECT
higher performance than the one on Solaris?
Thanks,
Dan
