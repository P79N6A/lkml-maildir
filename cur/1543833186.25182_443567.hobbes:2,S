Even if you only put 4GB in then memory remapping for the PCI hole will 
usually put some memory beyond 4GB.
Of course again the mainboard vendor seems to have never
tested this so there might be other more subtle problems the kernel can't
help with.

Somewhat of a platitude. They would have no choice.

I'm still waiting for a positive test result. Ideally from multiple people 
because it's a pretty radical step to blacklist all VIA chipsets like this
(and it's s still possible that only some BIOS are broken, not all VIA boards)
In fact I've been trying to get confirmation from VIA on this, but they
never answered my queries.
