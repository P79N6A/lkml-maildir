In message <200207190354.WAA05241@ccure.karaya.com> you write:

I think the bug is checking the return value at all.  This code cannot
be a module (at least without significant furthur work), despite the
fact that someone nicely wrote an exitfunction for it.
And if the initialization fails at boot, we're screwed anyway.
