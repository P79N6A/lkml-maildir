Hi Philip.

Already corrected, now reads "Parallel port support is enabled."

 >>>>+    plip=		[LP,NET] Parallel port network link.
 >>>>+    lp= 		[LPT] Parallel Printer.

Ah...my apologies, that was just a case of bad phraseology. Have a
look at the latest version of the patch, at the following URL, where I
believe this has already been dealt with as detailed above.
