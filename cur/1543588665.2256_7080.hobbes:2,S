The view given by top is inaccurate because it has no way to detect shared
pages properly. This means for example that when you have glibc mapped into
all your N processes it counted N times its size, even though it only exists
once in memory. Worse it gets when you work with threaded programs; they
share their memory completely, but top/ps has no way to detect this and 
counts the single shared process space for every process (I have an 
experimental patch to fix the later problem) 
In addition there are quite a bit of internal data structures in the kernel
which never appear in top, but eat memory. Most prominent of that is the
page table itself, which eats a few percent of your ram for a management
structure for every page (in 2.2 on 32bit ~40 bytes every 4K of memory;
in 2.4 it is much worse)

No.
