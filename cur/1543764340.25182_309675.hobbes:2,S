As this has been discussed numerous times and consensus never achieved
and is unlikely to be achieved, I suggest that you keep this discussion
internal to Debian until at least you have patches which can be evaluated
and discussed.  Until then Debian may do to its kernel whatever it pleases
and should be prepared to explain to its users why it removed or altered
drivers.
