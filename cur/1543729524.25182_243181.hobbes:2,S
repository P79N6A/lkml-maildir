There is an error in the calculations.  16TB "RAM", means "RAM".
On many systems, a large chunk of the physical address space is
taken up by I/O areas, not real memory.
Such areas do not take up mem_map[] array space.
Regardless, I think an "unsigned long" page frame number is sufficient
for now.  Don't even make the new type.
