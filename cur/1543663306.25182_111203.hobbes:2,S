Indeed, only min and borrow are currently supported.

The "problem" here is that a lot of the memory in Cached: is
mapped into process address space, so in effect it is process
memory.
This is especially true for executables, libraries and shared
memory segments, which you REALLY want to have treated as process
memory and not as cache...
This makes the Cached statistic a bit confusing for administrators.

Doesn't it also have something like the borrow percentage, above
which AIX will only reclaim from the cache, unless the repaging
rate of the cache is higher than that of process memory ?
