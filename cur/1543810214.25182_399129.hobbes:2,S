We will remove the TODOs soon as possible.

The point is that our module have to run on Linux 2.6.5-7.244 (SuSE SLES 9 SP3), too.
This was the reason why we've included the ifdefs. We can change the ifdefs to
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2.6.5) to mark that this code is used for
Linux 2.6.5 compatibility.
Regards,
