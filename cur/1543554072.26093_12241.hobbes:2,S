Not strictly true... Many of the capabilities in Linux now came from what
was "big iron" 10 years ago. At the rate that CPU speeds/multi-CPU systems
are becoming available, the current "big iron" will be on your desk, sharing
data among many other systems to solve even bigger problems.
I happen to be a proponent of big iron features...  Just let ME choose which
ones I need, and which I don't.
I already need MLS and VPN support with encryption (IPSec + more :). When my
SGI workstation gets replaced (by a Linux PC) I'll want to be able to
administer (securely) the security structures supported by Cray UNICOS,
Trusted Solaris and Trusted IRIX.
Currently, I have to downgrade the security of the Cray systems just to
administer it (not good, but currently acceptable by the Powers That Be).
I want better. Better security, better authentication, better identification,
secure communication, and auditability. All of this is currently part of "big
iron", but is needed in the commercial world. IPSec is beginning to be called
for in business. MLS is already used there, and I think its use will only
expand. Anything that makes an improvement in this area is needed.
I believe that having the hooks might make it easier to implement higher
levels of security by option. It will certainly make it easer to test
new features. Include a module that attaches to hooks already present --
Other users wouldn't need the module. So let it be an option.
Linux already runs on big iron. Why not support it.
