Say an evil bug is discovered in 2.6.8.1 about the time people find out 
that cdrecord and vmware don't run on 2.6.9 and Oracle causes a massive 
memory leak. Since the developers seem to totally disregard pre-release 
testing with any 3rd party or closed source software, this isn't totally 
out of the question.
So out comes 2.6.8.2 to protect the honor and virtue of all the users 
who run 3rd party software for some silly reason like needing it to make 
a living.
