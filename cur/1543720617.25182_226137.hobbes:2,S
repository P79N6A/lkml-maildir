That was me ;).  Sorry, John.  When you see a 'cpuset' patch submitted
to lkml from Simon Derr and/or myself, then I should have time to get
back to the sn2 portion of this bssprot patch.  Meanwhile, the guys that
sign my paycheck got first dibbs on my time.
If anyone else with access to an sn2 can step up, that'd be fine.
