I've seen this with the tulip, epic100 and eepro100 drivers. You're
seeing it with:

All of these drivers were written by Donald Becker. One or 2 weeks
ago someone found a basic mistake in most of the drivers from Donald,
and posted patches for the tulip driver. Someone else posted a pointer
to a new eepro100 driver, which I am using now and which works fine
without locking up. Hopefully Donald is following this list and will
fix his drivers .. both 2.2.1X and 2.3.x really need those fixes.
Mike.
