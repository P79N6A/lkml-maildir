It is even worse when they try to "translate" the terms. In Spanish, the
official language calls a computer "ordenador" (sorting device), and a file
"fichero" (filing cabinet). It doesn't help in the least at understanding
the _English_ documentation/source/... Add to it that here in South America
they usually take over the English terms, using "computador" (computing
device) and "archivo" (file). So it can even make it hard to understand the
technical literature in your own language... My standard advise is to learn
English, if nothing else for uniformity's sake. You'll need it anyway
before long in anything related to computing. And it is quite useful in
other areas...
