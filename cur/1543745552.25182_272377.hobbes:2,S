This is a follow-up to my previous "hostfs - uml: set .sendfile to
generic_file_sendfile" patch. I was asking whether other methods should have
been added, and comparing with ext3 I found some more ones.
However, I have not specific clues about them: I know they use the pagecache,
which relies on *page methods, which are defined by hostfs. So I think it
could work.
I have a doubt, whether hostfs needs the commented out method below:
static struct address_space_operations hostfs_aops = {
	.writepage 	= hostfs_writepage,
	.readpage	= hostfs_readpage,
/* 	.set_page_dirty = __set_page_dirty_nobuffers, */
	.prepare_write	= hostfs_prepare_write,
	.commit_write	= hostfs_commit_write
};
Hostfs does not have a underlying device (and I have some rough idea that
buffers cache block devices data), so I wonder if that is needed or not.
