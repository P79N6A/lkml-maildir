The old keyboard was controlled by ADB (Apple Desktop Bus) commands sent
by pbbuttonsd. That doesn't work for the USB keyboard because the
conversion is not done in hardware like with the old ones. ioctl's would
also be possible, but I'm not sure wether they would be easy to do for
USB devices. Module parameters can be changed using sysfs.
