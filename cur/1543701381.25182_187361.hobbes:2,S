Thanks, I have gotten a lot of response to this message from Gentoo
users appologizing for the "bad seeds".  By no means did I mean to
disparage all Gentoo users, just the ones that keep bothering me with

In fact, now that I know Gentoo works without devfs, I'm considering
putting it on an old laptop I have around here...
