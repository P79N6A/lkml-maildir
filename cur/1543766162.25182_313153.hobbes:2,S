Only a new user would have to pull the whole history ... and for most
uses it is sufficient to just pull the current top of the tree. Linus'
own tree only has a history going back to 2.6.12.-rc2 (when he started
using git).
Someday there might be a server daemon that can batch up the changes for
a "pull" to conserve network bandwidth.
There is a mailing list "git@vger.kernel.org" where these issues are
discussed.  Archives are available at marc.theaimsgroup.com and gelato.
