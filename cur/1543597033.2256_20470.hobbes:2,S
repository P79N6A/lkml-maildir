I will say that you are incredibly correct. Accualy rather funny.

 But at least it sounds good.

We don't. We would like to change that.

  Quite correct

We would like any information that they have. I hope they do not.

That line is hillarious to me. And you are right! I merely intended to show
that we are trying to go somewhere beyond a mailing list thread. To avoid
anything more i will say *trying* agin.

Unfortunatly I have not heard this yet. I have not been able to look at the
list
archives to see all of what has been posted there.
