Subject: Announce loop-AES-v2.2a file/swap crypto package
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Fixed multi-key ioctl incompatibility with sparc64 boxes running 64 bit
  kernel and 32 bit userland. Fix enabled for 2.4.26 and later 2.4 kernels.
  2.6 kernels were not affected.
- Added key scrubbing support for AES loop cipher. This feature is not
  enabled by default because it doubles storage space requirement for loop
  encryption keys. To enable, add KEYSCRUB=y parameter to loop module make
  command. (2.4 and 2.6 kernels only).
- Added multi-key compatibility to losetup and mount -p option handling.
- Fixed incompatibility with 2.6.8.1 kernel struct bio handling.
- Small optimization to bio I/O barrier support. Also added support for
  queue->issue_flush_fn() I/O barrier calls. (2.6 kernels only).
- Added workaround for kernel bug that causes I/O errors on -EWOULDBLOCK I/O
  elevator failures (2.6 kernels only).
