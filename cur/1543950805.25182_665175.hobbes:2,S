Looks like a very good patch - thanks for your effort in moving this
beyond the "hand-waving" stage that it's been in for the past few years.
I'm looking at what implications this has for delayed allocation in ext4,
because the vast majority of file data will be unmapped in that case
and a journal commit in ordered mode will no longer cause the data to
be flushed to disk.
I _think_ is OK, because the pdflushd will now be totally in charge of
flushing the dirty pages to disk, instead of this previously being done
by ordered mode in the journal.  I know there have been some bugs in this
area in the past, but I guess it isn't much different than running in
writeback mode.  That said, I don't know how many users run in writeback
mode unless they are running a database, and the database is doing a lot
of explicit fsync of file data so there may still be bugs lurking...
Some care is still needed here because with ext4 delayed allocation the
common case will be unmapped buffers, while the ext3 implementation will
only have this in very rare cases (unmapped mmap writes), but it looks
like the right mechanism is already in place for both.
I'll just put a bunch of comments inline, not necessarily problems, just
walking through the code to ensure I understand what is going on...

(comment) This is flushing out pages allocated in the previous transaction
to keep consistent semantics in case of a crash loses the delete...  There
is some possibility for optimization here - comments below at

I guess the common case here for delalloc is that if someone cares to fsync
the file then that inode would be added to the journal list and the pages
would be mapped here in the process context and flushed with the journal
commit.  This is ideal because it avoids syncing out all of the dirty pages
for inodes that were NOT fsync'd and fixes the "one process doing fsync
kills performance for streaming writes" problem in ordered mode that was
recently discussed on the list.
We in fact win twice because fsync_page_range() will potentially only
map and flush the range of pages that the application cares about and
does not necessarily have to write out all pages (though that will still
happen in ordered mode if the pages had previously been mapped).

Is there any reason to keep this in the non-data-journal case?  Adding
buffer heads to every page is a non-trivial amount of RAM usage.

Should we J_ASSERT() this is true?  Probably better to put this comment

Hmm, this is one area I'm a bit worried about.  In the old code the number
of buffers to sync for a transaction are bounded because they can only be
added to the transaction while it is open.  With this new inode-list code
there could be a process busily adding new dirty + mapped pages to the
inode(s) in the running transaction, while we are blocked here writing
out the pages in kjournald trying to commit the previous transaction.
At some point we will eventually no longer be able to add new pages to the
running transaction (because it is full or was closed due to timeout) and
we won't be able to start a new transaction because the committing transaction
has not yet committed.  At that point we would be able to finish the commit
of the previous transaction, but not until we had reached the point of
blocking all operations in the filesystem waiting for the new transaction
to open.  This would essentially lead to livelock of the system, with
stop-start-stop cycles for the transactions and IO.
What would be needed is some kind of mechanism to separate the dirty pages
on the inode into "dirty from current transaction" and "dirty from the
previous transaction".  That seems non-trivial, however.  I guess we could
also force any process doing writing to flush out all of the dirty and
mapped pages on the inode if it detects the inode is in two transactions.
This would at least parallelize the IO submission and also throttle the
addition of new pages until the dirty ones on the committing transaction
had been flushed but may essentially mean sync IO performance for streaming
writes on large files without delalloc (which would not add new pages that
are mapped normally).

Rather than numbering these phases, which has little meaning and often
means they just get renumbered like here, it is probably more useful to
give them descriptive names like "JBD: commit wait for data buffers", etc.

Should we be returning an error back to the caller at this point?

Is it possible/safe to do the above check outside of the j_list_lock
as an optimization?  We will be calling this function for every page
that is dirtied and it will likely be quite highly contended.  It used
to be that we HAD to get this lock because we were almost certainly
adding the new buffers to the transaction list, but in this updated
code the common case is that the inode will already be on the list...

Is there any way here to entirely avoid writing blocks which were just
allocated during the current transaction (e.g. temp files during compile
or whatever)?  One possibility is to store the transaction number when
the inode was created (or first dirtied?) in ext3_inode_info and if that is
equal to the committing transaction then we don't need to write anything
at all?
Cheers, Andreas
