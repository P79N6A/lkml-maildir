I think this is great. In general, I think people who want to add their 
own extra tags after their email address should be able to do so. We might 
even have a few standard tags for things like asking for acknowledgement

I think the "(unless I am permitted to submit under a different license)" 
part already covers that,  but yes, if we want to get really technically 
anal about it we migth spell it out.

Would the extra tag at the end be sufficient for that, or are you talking 
about something more?
