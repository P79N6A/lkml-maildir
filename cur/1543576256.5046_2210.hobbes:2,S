This isn't from the kernel, but works great in userspace:
iptables -n RANDOM
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -j RANDOM
iptables -A RANDOM -p tcp --dport 6699 -j <otherchain/rule>
iptables -A RANDOM -p tcp --dport 21 -j <asabove>
iptables -A RANDOM -p tcp --dport 32 -j <ditto,etc>
iptables -A RANDOM -m state --state ! NEW -j <thisisgettingstupidnow>
iptables -P RANDOM -j ULOG --ulog-nlgroup 32
This sends a message down netlink in ULOG format.
ULOG is a userspace logging extension written by Harald Welte, but it's
extensible like you wouldn't believe, so you could easily do some whacky
stuff with it. Or just hook in to a Netfilter hook and do it all from kernel
land.
