I repaired my filesystems by booting with "init=/bin/bash" parameter via
lilo. Then I try hit : ALT-SysReq-S to sync and I got some kernel oops.
Since the machine couldn't be used after that I wrote only the last
three lines of oop :
Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Kernel panic: Attemped to kill the idle task
In swapper task - not syncing
(2.1.132 UP)
I also noticed, that I had got LOTS OF 'zero dtime' message from fsck.
lgb@oxygene:~$ fsck.ext2 -V
e2fsck 1.12, 9-Jul-98 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
        Using EXT2FS Library version 1.12, 9-Jul-98
