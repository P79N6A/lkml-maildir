Hi all,
I need a Fast Ethernet chip for an Open Hardware PCI board I'm 
working on. Of course said chip has to be available in small 
quantities (and not just attached to a NIC), and well supported by 
Linux. Other 'nice but not crucial' properties would be:
- Gigabit Ethernet support
- Integrated PHY
- 66MHz PCI compliant
- Multiple ports
As it stands I'm thinking about using the Intel 82559ER (which lacks 
Gig Enet and 66MHz PCI), but I'm *very* open to other suggestions.
Thanks,
JD 'linux-hardware-dev@vger anyone ?' B.
[oh, and the board will have 4-way SMP with G4 PowerPCs]
