Looks like the RCU contention is still there.
I ran some bench marks at 512p on a 2.6.5 SUSE kernel with and without
Manfred's patches 4 and 5 added (the SUSE kernel already has the 3
accepted RCU patches), and the results were very promising.  I think
we'll want to pursue getting these other two RCU patches accepted.
I'll to get some lockmeter numbers on a latest -mm kernel next week.
