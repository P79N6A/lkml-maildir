I totally agree with you.
Then let me rephrase it that way: maybe not enough people care enough about
the build system for kbuild25 to be worth it...

But is it really enough?
Linus himself once said: "Especially as I don't find the existign system so
broken." He's not alone according to the amount (or lack) of public
complains with regards to the current system.

Indeed, I agree.
But until there is enough people committed to kb25 to the point of pushing
for its wider adoption, either by releasing traditional kernel patches (like
the -dj, -aa, -ac or whatever) actually carrying kb25 so to convince Linus
and others, or producing "piecemeal" patches so it can be merged by Linus
with less resistance, well nothing will hapen.
If people aren't interested enough and/or willing to comply with Linus'
requirements this will be a sad dead end, regardless the amount of effort
Keith put into this.
