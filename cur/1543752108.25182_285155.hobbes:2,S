I've been running the P-BKL all day and I've been very
happy with it so far.
I've found the machine to be very responsive and smooth
during compilation of large programs, playback of audio/
video, all the usual stuff I do on my desktop machine.
The problem is:  the same machine was also great two
days ago, before the preemptible BKL -- the best it's
been for years.  I can't tell the difference, and I
had no complaints even before this update.
Two questions:
Would I expect to see a difference on a uni-processor
machine?  (That's all I have.)
What kind of testing could I do to demonstrate the
difference?
