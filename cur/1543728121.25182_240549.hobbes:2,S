Please, if you don't want to answer the original question, don't post anything.
My answer:
Yes, burn-proof (or however the vendor calls the corresponding feature) saves
your disk where otherwise you run into dead-end. That's what it was meant to
be. When there is no underrun, burn-proof should not do any harm.
