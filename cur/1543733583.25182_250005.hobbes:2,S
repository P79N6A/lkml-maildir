"Broken" in the sense "POSIX mandates something that users wouldn't
expect".

How would you consider cp to cause "data loss" if it _besides_ copying
the normal stream _also_ copied any named streams or xattrs belonging
to the stream?  How would it cause data loss if cp started using a
theoretical copyfile syscall?  It may not be 100% according to POSIX,
but I'd definitely say that it does what the user expects.
Lots of GNU utilities already differ from POSIX mandated behaviour
because the authors of those utilities belive that the POSIX mandated
behaviour is confusing.
http://www.wlug.org.nz/POSIXLY_CORRECT
    POSIXLY_CORRECT is an environment variable that some programs use
    to follow strict POSIX standards behaviour, where that isn't the
    default.
    Probably the most well-known example of this is that POSIX states
    that filesystem blocks are 512 bytes per block, so the GNU
    fileutils such as df(1) and GNU tar(1) use 512 if the variable
    POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, and 1024 bytes per block by default.
    Many of the GNU tools comply with POSIX by default, except for
    where the author thinks the POSIX standard is wrong or dumb. :) As
    a result, some programs also check if a variable named
    POSIX_ME_HARDER is set as an acceptable alias for
    POSIXLY_CORRECT. See Democracy Triumphs in Disk Units.
