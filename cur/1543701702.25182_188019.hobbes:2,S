Forgot to say in other mail to you - I had weird issues with nodes
that was not yet sysfs'ified in the past due to strange permissions
(this is now aside those on ptmx).   Try rc1-mm1 for misc/vc sysfs
support (might be a fluke, but I have not yet had strange going on's
since Greg posted them, so maybe it might be /dev/null, etc that
caused issues for me, that did it for you as well), or if you roll
your own kernels, I will be glad to post you the patches off list if
you cannot find them here.
