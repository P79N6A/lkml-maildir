I can do that - then you'll have a script to be run on the target
computer to get the configuration (mine), and a script to be run on
the compiling computer to produce the relevant kernel and modules
(yours).

That I couldn't check, as the system I was on when I developed that
script didn't have the parallel port system compiled in, so I had to
guess...

True.

It is an internal modem, yes.

In this case, the modem is an ISA non-PnP internal model, and the
conflict arises because the modem can only access the low interrupts,
of which 2/9 and 5 are the only free ones. Both systems also have
network adapters in them, both being ISA-based NE2k clones, and both
are correctly auto-detected by the probe logic. However, one is set
(through non-jumpered means) to use IRQ5 and the other (through the
same non-jumpered means) to use IRQ2/9 and I've no idea how to change
that. What I'd like is to get both network cards using IRQ2/9 and then
just leave the modem using IRQ5 but I've been unsuccessful in doing
so...

Neither have I as I've only ever used ix86 systems. However, on the
software level, I understand that `make bzImage` only applies to ix86
based systems since the others don't have the stupid boot memory
limitation that ix86 systems have.
Basically, I see the system working as follows:
 1. My configuration script will produce a SysConfig file for the
    system it is run on. This will be an architecture-dependant
    script stored in arch/*/autoconfig and will produce a file
    with THREE types of lines in it:
     1. Comments, being lines beginning with a '#' character.
     2. AUTOCONFIG_* lines will be instructions to your compiler
	script to give it important information. Such lines will
	appear first in the output file. The following are typical
	examples of these lines:
		AUTOCONFIG_ARCHITECTURE=ix86
		AUTOCONFIG_DISTRIBUTION=RedHat
     3. CONFIG_* lines will be those currently used in .config
	to state the configuration to be used.
    Note that the configuration produced by this tool will usually
    NOT include every possible option. Because of this, what it
    WILL do is to include every option it handles with lines of
    the last type, even if it is setting them to "n".
 2. Your tool will read the AUTOCONFIG lines from the selected
    SysConfig file and use them to preconfigure itself to compile
    for the desired architecture, etc. Note that this implies that
    the compiling system is set up for cross-compilation if needed.
    If these settings are such that the desired result can not be
    produced on the compiling system, your tool will report the
    error and abort at this stage.
 3. Your compilation tool will read in the selected SysConfig file
    produced by my tool, and will compare the settings therein to
    those in the config.in tree in the relevant kernel, noting that
    the options in the two files will probably not be in the same
    sequence, and it is also possible that there will be options
    listed in the SysConfig file that are not required by the tree
    conditionals in the config.in tree.
 4. For any option not listed in the SysConfig file, and also for
    any option listed therein with an invalid value, your tool will
    ask the user for the desired setting, in the same order that
    they are listed in the config.in tree. Basically, it acts like
    a `make oldconfig` using the SysConfig file as the old setup.
 5. When the above has been completed, your tool will verify that
    the user wishes to compile a kernel for that configuration, and
    if the users confirms such, will go ahead and compile it.
Perhaps you could comment on the above scenario?
Best wishes from Riley.
