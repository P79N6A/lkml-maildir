On your keyboard, that is.  So what?
My keyboard happen to have no easy way of entering a dollar sign,
even though it is in «ascii».  That makes sense though, as it is one
of those ascii characters that is almost never used in my part of the world.
Still, if I needed to use the «$» when programming, I sure could map it to
some key combination.  X is nice that way.
