No it wont. A process that has notifications to process should do that 
before being put into the freezer. Only after the notification list is 
empty will the process be notified and as long as the notification is 
pending no second notification should happen.

I am not sure how to sort that out. I guess post the current patches that 
you got and then we see how to continue from there.
