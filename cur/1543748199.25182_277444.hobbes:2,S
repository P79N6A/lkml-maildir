You guys pick one or other or a mix. I run 4 base testcases for the
policer typically:
1) Old kernel, uptodate TC - MUST pass
2) old kernel, old tc (trivial - expected to pass).
3) New Kernel, uptodate TC - MUST pass
4) New Kernel, uptodate TC - MUST pass (although trivial)
Try both setting, dumping then deleting policies.
If these tests pass, please push patch to Dave. 
cheers,
jamal
