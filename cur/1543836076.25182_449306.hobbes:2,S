Subject: NFS root broken in 2.6.18-rc2-mm1

FYI,
I tried to boot 2.6.18-rc2-mm1 on a nfsroot system with x86-64 defconfig.
Unfortunately it seems to generate lots of random EIO while reading executables 
during the startup sequence, which causes some things to break. Writing
also doesn't seem to work - it complains about EPERM for that.
Not all executables error out, but at least some.
The same setup works fine with mainline 2.6.18-rc*
