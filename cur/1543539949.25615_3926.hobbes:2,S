Petr,
There's a problem too with the NFS server that runs on NetWare.  It's
ancient code (but the Bangalore Novell folks have taken it over, so
there'e hope it will get fixed if they monitor this list).  If "pipe" or
"fifo" permissions get written into it on 4.x NFS NFS->mode field in the
namespace on the server (the 5.x NFS server doesn't even load properly
on some of the DevelopNet releases of 5.1 of late) the server can get an
Abend or "process suspended" message and hang the NFS server on
NetWare.  
I've seen it on 4.x but nt 5.x, since I cannot even get the NLM NFS
version to load and work properly at all with Linux on NetWare 5.1.
