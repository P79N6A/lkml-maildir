I'm curious how other arches deal with this too.  Like on ppc64 when
you want to remove a CPU or set of CPUs, you have to bring it (or all
of the cores on a given module) down via software, then go into the
lab and find the module to pull it out.  Is there a mapping somewhere
that the user is expected to use?  A hypervisor call of some sort to
make some lights blink?

This seems like one of the main uses--find components that went bad.
Physically locating a CPU, DIMM, PCI board, or disk would all be
easier if we provided some sort of physical identifier and
logical->physical mapping information.  On IRIX, we actually expose
the whole physical hierarchy of the system in /hw.  One of the
problems with that approach is that everytime a new system
configuration is released the kernel has to be updated to know about
it, resulting in /hw paths that change over time, and from system to
system...
