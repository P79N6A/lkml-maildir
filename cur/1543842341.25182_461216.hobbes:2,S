What would you call the 'get excited' level?  Here, with about 12 hours of 
uptime (I had an unlogged machine shutdown while I was offsite yesterday), 
I'm showing 
buffer_head        67158  67158     48   78    1 : tunables  120   60    
0 : slabdata    861    861      0
There are other entries that are larger here.  However I do note that its 
growing on a per cycle basis as fetchmail is doing its thing every 90 
seconds.  Now its
buffer_head        67672  67704     48   78    1 : tunables  120   60    
0 : slabdata    868    868      0
So perhaps thats why it did the shutdown?  With absolutely zip in the logs?
Although, my firewall box was also reset/rebooted about the same time as 
this ones powerdown according to an uptime report on it just now, so my 
ups must not be doing its thing correctly.
