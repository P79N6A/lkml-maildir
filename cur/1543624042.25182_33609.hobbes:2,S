The way I currently work is I do a cvs diff, store it in a file,
and reverse apply it to my cvs tree, so I have a clean tree
again.  You do this with several things you're working on.
Then someone changes something, so you do a cvs update, you apply
the patches, deal with conflicts if any, and make a new patch of it.
What I would like to see, and think that they mean is, I tag
those change as a "patch" in the tree, probably localy, and I
just do a cvs update, and if there are no conflicts, I'm done.
If you only have 1 thing you're working on (per tree), cvs update
should work, but I don't want to copy the tree several times.
