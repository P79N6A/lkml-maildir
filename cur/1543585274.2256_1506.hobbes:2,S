Ok, at least we've got the same picture that we're working from now.

The calling function does indeed do the read_lock_xtime_and_ints() bit
for us.  However, we can always do a read_unlock(); sti(); read_lock_irq();
in do_gettimeofday().  Whether we want to or not is another matter,
especially as its not nice for a called function to explicitly enable
interrupts.
As for timer interrupts taking more than 10ms, yes, that is another
problem. ;(

This problem has a non-trivial solution, and I think whoever originally
wrote the x86 do_gettimeofday code decided that it wasn't worth finding
a solution to it.
