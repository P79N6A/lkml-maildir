I've tested out both patches sent to me.
Test 1: aacraid-1.1.5-2245.tgz
Works flawlessly and speedily! The rsync completes, and doing a sync() (as
called during a normal lilo update) takes roughly 1 second as opposed to 20
with the original aacraid patch from Alan Cox. Also, no SCSI hang message ever
appears.
Test 2: Mark Haverkamp's linit.c patch
The "SCSI hang" console message appears just as before during the 'rsync',
however (unlike before) the device is still usable for roughly 30 seconds after
the problem. During these 30 seconds, the 'rsync' process is hung, but I can
still do a 'df', 'ls', and so on. After 30 seconds, the entire /dev/sda locks
up and I have no choice but to reboot the system.
