Looking at the stack usage numbers, this was with a gcc that supports
unit-at-a-time.
If you use gcc 3.4 and enable unit-at-a-time (see my other email) the 
i386 numbers look quite similar.
I doubt there are many architecture or 64 bit [1] specific stack usage 
problems, so working on i386 might be enough.

[1] theoretically a factor of two was possible due to the different
    pointer sizes - but I have yet to see any example where this
    really matters
