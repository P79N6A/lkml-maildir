  Hi, all. Version 218 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.5/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.5/devfs-patch-current.gz
NOTE: kernel 2.5.1 and later require devfsd-v1.3.19 or later.
This is against 2.5.43. Highlights of this release:
- Removed DEVFS_FL_AUTO_OWNER flag
- Switched lingering structure field initialiser to ISO C
- Added locking when setting/clearing flags
- Documentation fix in fs/devfs/util.c
				Regards,
					Richard....
