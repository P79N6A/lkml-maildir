Yesserrie, it works, assuming dont_enable_local_apic gets set to "1"
somewhere, somehow.  In the case of broken hardware (or a broken emulation
of it, like VMware 2.0.4) however, a command line arg (such as the nolapic
patch you posted previously) is still needed to disable the local apic in
the case where there is no DMI information that can be used to add the
broken system to the blacklist.
A combination of your previous nolapic patch and this one you just posted
would do the trick indeed.
Thanx much!
