Yes, I'll prepare one at the weekend when I have access to my patches again. 
Mail will be sent out on monday. I'll send you two patches: first one to fix 
it properly and then one that cleans up a bit more. The second one will do 
the same things like the patch I forwarded you on April 2nd. It would be nice 
if you could have a look on this patch in the mean time so you maybe can 
apply the second one immediately.
