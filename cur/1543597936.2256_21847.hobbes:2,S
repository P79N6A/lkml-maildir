It also doesnt solve all the cases. Basically its just ensuring everyone
doing portable code has to go and change all their macros to MIN and MAX
instead. Or use if statements, which with all the subtle suprises of
type casting is actually often a far far better idea and probably should
be encouraged a lot more in the kernel
