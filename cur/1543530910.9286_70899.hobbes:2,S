    Yes! We've promised the program that it has those 256 kB all to
itselves. This means that the system must have this memory at all times in
some shape or form until the program free()s it.

   This is very application dependent. For example, to inetd, memory
allocation failure just means that it can't launch external servers and
will have to postpone reloading of its config file. As long as no OOM
killer comes along inetd's way, it will do fine unless coded in a stupid
way. The latter possibility isn't a kernel issue.

   Not when overcommitting memory. That's the whole problem, and why I want
it to be possible to turn off overcommitment of memory completely.
