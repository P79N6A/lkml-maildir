Hi,
I'm guessing since no one replied it's because either I did not provide 
enough details or the the problem itself specific to my hardware which 
no one has :)
In an effort to help out as much as I can, could someone shed some light 
on how I can debug this further?  What kernel debugging options should 
be enabled?  And how can I actually debug this since the system will not 
  boot while the problem is happening?
Thanks in advance!

(please note that 2.4.18 does work _without_ a hitch, but 2.4.19 fails)
