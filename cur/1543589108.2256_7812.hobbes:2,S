Note that I think all these arguments are fairly bogus.  Doing things like
"dump" on a live filesystem is stupid and dangerous (in my opinion it is
stupid and dangerous to use "dump" at _all_, but that's a whole 'nother
discussion in itself), and there really are no valid uses for opening a
block device that is already mounted. More importantly, I don't think
anybody actually does.
The fact that you _can_ do so makes the patch valid, and I do agree with
Al on the "least surprise" issue. I've already applied the patch, in fact.
But the fact is that nobody should ever do the thing that could cause
problems.
