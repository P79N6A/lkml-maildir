In general I think that's the right idea. See below for more...

I agree for giving a process more than a fair share, but I don't think 
"latency" is the best term for what you describe later. If you think of 
latency as the time between a process unblocking and the time when it 
gets CPU, that is a more traditional interpretation. I'm not really sure 
latency and CPU-starved are compatible.
I would like to see processes at the head of the queue (for latency) 
which were blocked for long term events, keyboard input, network input, 
mouse input, etc. Then processes blocked for short term events like 
disk, then processes which exhausted their time slice. This helps 
latency and responsiveness, while keeping all processes running.
A variation is to give those processes at the head of the queue short
