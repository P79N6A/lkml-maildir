Yes, it's very tricky ! I have (naïvly) try this:
vaddr=vmalloc(len);
do_mmap(file ,kvaddr ,len ,PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE ,MAP_FIXED|MAP_PRIVATE
,0);
Here, do_mmap check if the addresse match inside current process and
return me -ENOMEM. Are there others functions which i could use to
associate this file and a vmalloc'ed space ?
