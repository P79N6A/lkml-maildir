Subject: [PATCH] Fix bounds check bug in __register_chrdev_region
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/1/410

The code in __register_chrdev_region checks that if the driver wishing
to register has the same major as an existing driver the new minor range
is strictly less than the existing minor range.  However, it does not
also check that the new minor range is strictly greater than the
existing minor range.  That is, if driver X has registered with 
major=x and minor=0-3, __register_chrdev_region will allow driver Y to
register with major=x and minor=1-4.
I came across this in the context of the Xen virtual console driver, but I
imagine it causes a problem for any driver with the same major number
but different minor numbers as a driver that has registered ahead of it.
