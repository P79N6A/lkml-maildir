For testing the repsonsiveness I usually check the startup time of
applications like netscape with cold cache, later I just start an high
vm load on my desktop and I see how long can I keep working without
being too hurted. the first is certainly a measurable test, the second
isn't reliable since it doesn't generate raw numbers and it's too much
in function of the human feeling but it shows very well any patological
problem of the code. But they may not be the best tests.

That's still fine procedure, only make sure to pick the latest 2.4.12
one based on 2.4.12aa1 before running the tests. thanks,
