The problem I have with linux patches and patch -pXXX is that patch
behaves differently with the -pXXX option depending on if a new file is
being created or if its patching an old one. 
For example if I use patch -p2 <patch, standing inside the linux
directory, two slashes are stripped off the filenames just as they should
(since they are named like v2.2.0/linux/xxxx). But all new files get one
extra strip, so they end up in the linux root.. which breaks eveything
badly of course.
So there must be some extra magic needed for patching cleanly...
