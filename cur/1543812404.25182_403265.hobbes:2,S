Subject: 2.6.16-rc regression: m68k CONFIG_RMW_INSNS=n compile broken

The m68k defconfig does no longer compile in 2.6.16-rc:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      fs/file_table.o
fs/file_table.c: In function `fget':
fs/file_table.c:170: warning: implicit declaration of function `cmpxchg'
...
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
fs/built-in.o(.text+0x275a): In function `fget':
: undefined reference to `cmpxchg'
fs/built-in.o(.text+0x27da): In function `fget_light':
: undefined reference to `cmpxchg'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
It seems the problem is that in the CONFIG_RMW_INSNS=n case, there's no 
cmpxchg #define in include/asm-m68k/system.h required for the 
atomic_add_unless #define in include/asm-m68k/atomic.h.
