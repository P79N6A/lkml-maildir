You are right.

I avoid copying the strings not because of the copy itself, but to not
bother freeing them when v9fs_fcall structure is freed. You are right, the
logic is wrong. I was trying (obviously unsuccessfully) to match strcmp
semantics, although I only use the function to check for equality of the
strings.

It is not just weird, it is wrong and can lead to writing outside of the
buffer.
Thanks for reviewing the code.
