Sure, will add something.  I wonder if this new interface is documented.
I note that this interface is new in -mm at this time.  So that brings
up an interesting question as to how one would integrate this check with
checkpatch.  As checking patches for mainline, this would be an
incorrect check until that patch merges.  I guess the right thing to do
is provide a separate patch for checkpatch which adds this check which
should sit with the patch in your tree which adds the functionality.
Make sense?
