Chris, do you know if this is needed in this case?

That test seems to be the original intention for the splitup. 
The security modules just put their hooks here. Maybe we can
fold these hooks into __scm_send() and have the old
splitup again to get the old code paths back.
It seems that the credential copy in af_unix.c 
memcpy(UNIXCREDS(skb), &siocb->scm->creds, sizeof(struct ucred));
if (siocb->scm->fp)
            unix_attach_fds(siocb->scm, skb);
doesn't depend on the "msg_controllen <= 0" test. If we can introduce this 
dependency there, we can put credential setup into __scm_send().
I would suggest we fold these two lines into a function and decide this later.
Chris, would this suffice?

Ingo Oeser
