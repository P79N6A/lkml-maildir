If people want a C++ kernel, follow Linus's example. Go away and write one.
Whatever the benefits of C++/C adding a third language to the kernel sources
is going to result in nothing but combining the worst of C and C++.
As with the rest of the kernel development, put up, or shut up. 
If C++ is so great a language for kernel development it should be possible to 
produce a new all singing, all dancing, leaner and meaner kernel in next to no time.
You have a working source base to start from and it should be very easy with so 
many expert C++ programmers available.
If it proves to be technically superior you'll have made your point, and kernel 
development would probably shift to using C++.
Personally I'd look on such a code fork as a win-win situation. (At least for the
kernel mailing lists.)
