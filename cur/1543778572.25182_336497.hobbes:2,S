These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness and interactivity. 
It is configurable to any workload but the default ck* patch is aimed at the 
desktop and ck*-server is available with more emphasis on serverspace.
Apply to 2.6.12 (This includes all patches in 2.6.12.3):

or for server version:

all patches:

Split patches available.
Changes since 2.6.12-ck3:
Added:
+s11.3_s11.4.diff 
Staircase cpu scheduler update. Change rr intervals to 5ms minimum. With 
interbench I can confidently say there is objective evidence of interactive 
improvement in the human perceptible range with this change :)
HZ-864.diff 
+My take on the never ending config HZ debate. Apart from the number not being 
pleasing on the eyes, a HZ value that isn't a multiple of 10 is perfectly 
valid. Setting HZ to 864 gives us very similar low latency performance to a 
1000HZ kernel, decreases overhead ever so slightly, and minimises clock drift 
substantially. The -server patch uses HZ=82 for similar reasons, with the 
emphasis on throughput rather than low latency. Madness? Probably, but then I 
can't see any valid argument against using these values.
Changed:
-patch-2.6.12.2
+patch-2.6.12.3
Latest stable version.
-2612ck3-version.diff
+2612ck4-version.diff
Version.
Cheers,
Con
