Could you please explain why you think such a scenario is possible? The
timer functions themselves should never be causing a re-queue, and every
iteration through the loop in __rpc_execute() should cause any pending
timer to be killed, as should rpc_release_task().
That's why we can use del_singleshot_timer_sync() in the first place:
because there is no recursion, and no re-queueing that can cause races.
I don't see how either preemption or RT will change that (and if they
do, then _that_ is the real bug that needs fixing).
Cheers,
  Trond
