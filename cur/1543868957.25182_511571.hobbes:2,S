I spose I'll hold my nose and merge this, but it creates too much of a mess
to be mergeable into the CPU scheduler, IMO.
Can we please do something to reduce the ifdef density?  And if possible,
all the newly-added returns-from-the-middle-of-a-function?

So we require that architectures which implement CONFIG_NO_HZ also
implement cmpxchg.

One definition per line is preferred.

It's not just that this is an eyesore (it is) - it introduces some ongoing
maintenance problems.  I expect this can be pulled out into a separate
function with no loss in quality of generated code.
And that function would be a nice site for a nice comment explaining the
design.  Why do we return if need_resched()?  What is the significance of
(balance_cpu >= NR_CPUS)?

A goto in an ifdef :(
Perhaps it can be removed by teaching the caller to call this function again?
