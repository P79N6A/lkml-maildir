ppc64 kgdb support is also broken but in a much more fundamental manner.

I cleared the redeclarations up and put in some defines but there is
much more fundamental breakage like

Even with the defines fixed up, I don't know what to do about
kgdb_skipexception() and friends because frankly I don't know what I'm
doing with kgdb. linuxppc-dev added to cc list this time in case they have
something useful.
The best I was able to come up with as a candidate fix was to disable
kgdb on ppc64 altogether. This is a cop-out, not a fix, sorry.
