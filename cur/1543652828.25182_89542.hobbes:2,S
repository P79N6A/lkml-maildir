Unfortunately that doesn't scale well, and introduces all sorts of 
potential red herrings in bug reports...  should I be handling bug 
reports for OSDL's Carrier Grade Linux branch, for example?  ;-)  and 
we've seen that there are patches in these various trees are often 
intentionally kept out of mainline for various reasons.
I'm definitely going to close net driver bug reports which aren't 
against mainline, without regards to their contents or value...
I thought this database was going to be used to stabalize 2.5...  not 
provide a vehicle for further time wastage and distraction :)
