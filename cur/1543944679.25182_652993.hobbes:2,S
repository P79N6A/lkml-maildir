BTW: Testing:  I cloned my git tree, resolved the two compile issues 
(void + include), then built and installed the kernel (2.6.25-rc1 + the 
fixed patch).  I then ensured that a connection to the local address 
caused the ENOSYS error.
I just forgot to pull the updated file back into my stg managed git tree.
