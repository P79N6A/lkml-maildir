Actually, that's stuff for rsync hackers, none of kernel stuff. When I
tried all that stuff on a virtual console, the console was quick enough
to let me spot another undead rsync process eating up memory, so it's
not a kernel issue, I believe.
Shame on me I didn't see this before sending me previous mail. Please
apologize.
