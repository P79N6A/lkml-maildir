Some more info:
This bug is 100% reproducible.  During boot, as soon as the i8042 driver
is loaded:
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
the keyboard freezes, with 'Num Lock' stuck on.
The problem only occurs when CONFIG_PREEMPT_HARDIRQS=y.  Works fine
otherwise.
