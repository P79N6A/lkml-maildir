OK, by 'patching the kernel' you must mean 'initialize the m68k_memory array'.
The loop you use does have one advantage: it can handle size variation vs a
shift-lookup strategy.  It's a lot more expensive though, and these are
heavily used operations.

I'll accept 'not needed for 68K', though I guess config_nonlinear will work
perfectly well for you and be faster than the loops.  However, some of the
problems that config_nonlinear solves cannot be solved by any existing kernel
mechanism.  We've been over the NUMA-Q and mips32 cases in detail, so I won't
reiterate.
Thanks for your input.
