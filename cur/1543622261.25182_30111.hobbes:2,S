It seems no normal behaviour, I checked several other boards of this type and none had a TSC skew (and all work). Purely guessing I would suggest two try some other 2 processors to verify the behaviour is really processor-independent. Another guess would of course be the MB itself being broken to some extent.
Has anybody ever seen a _working_ skew correction? Is this known-to-work code?
