hi
I am working on a kernel module which requires the addition of a large
number of kernel timers  to expire statistical values ( including time
) maintained in a table.
One alternative would be to use a single timer and traverse the entire
table and use the existing system time to expire the values ( comparing
it with the time already stored in the table )when the timer expires .
Following the method I describe first I would have to add a large number
of timers ( around 2000) ... would this cause any significant
performance drop  ? which method should I use ?
thanks in advance
Praveen
