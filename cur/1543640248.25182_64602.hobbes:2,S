I actually don't think it's the people as much as it is the ridiculous 
linkages inside ide.c and the hugely complicated rules. The code is messy.
The network drivers have various setups that share the same chipset, but 
there they tend to be individual drivers that just share helper routines. 
Each driver still does their own PCI driver registration etc. In contrast, 
when it comes to IDE, you're supposed to be an IDE driver first, and a PCI 
chipset driver second, and that putting o fthe cart before the horse 
results in problems.
Even something as simple as a PIIX driver (which _should_ just register 
itself as a driver for the piix chipsets) doesn't do that. Instead, we 
have ide-pci.c, which has a list of all the chipsets it knows about, and 
then does initialization and calls the init routines that it knows about. 
That's just incestuous.
And we all know where incest leads. Hereditary insanity.
