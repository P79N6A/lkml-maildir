I wonder if it can be simpler.  Make two changes:
a) If the scanner encounters an mlocked page on the LRU, take it off.
b) munlock() adds all affected pages to the LRU.
And that's it.  Simpler, solves the uselessly-scan-lots-of-mlocked-pages
problem (which is the sole requirement according to your description) and
doesn't consume a page flag.  Optional (and arguable) extension: scan the
vmas during munmap, don't add page to LRU if it's still mlocked.
Why _does_ your patch add a new page flag?  That info is available via a
vma scan.

Ow.  How were you thinking of fixing that?

Ow.  That could be a right pain when we get around to using migration for
memory-unplug?
