If "helping users" understand that cryptoloop is a band alternative is the  
main reason I think removing it is a bad idea.
If EXPERIMENTAL isn't discuraging enough why not use BROKEN? That way they  
will for sure know that something is wrong but can still upgrade their  
kernel without fearing to not get their data back because they can't get  
this "new thing" (dm-crypt) running.
