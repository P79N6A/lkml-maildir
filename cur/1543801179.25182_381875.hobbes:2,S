The maximum where unionfs should IMO go ATM is -mm, because it still has 
refcount issues and occassional crashes.
rt2400/etc is a bit more tricky. There exist several versions and they 
all have different levels of evolution :-/
 Group 1:
 - rt* from ralink.com.tw
 Group 2:
 - rt2400,rt2500,rt2570 "1.1.0" from sf.net/projects/rt2400
 - rt2x00 "2.0", also sf.net/projects/rt2400
Nevertheless, I do have rt* 1.1 and 2.0, and unionfs in my patchset...
