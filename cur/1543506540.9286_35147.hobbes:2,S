Subject: VIA chipset hangs???

I just installed a new AMD K6-3 450mhz processor on a Tyan S1590S Super7
mobo (AT form factor) (VIA chipset) with 1meg cache and 128M PC100 8ms
SDRAM. I am experiencing total system hangs whenever I use my sound
card, a Gravis Ultrasound Max. I have also had the system lock up
whenever there is heavy video updates (Number Nine Vision 330) and with
a different sound card (Opti Mad 16) so I suspect that it is not
directly related to the either my sound card or my video card. I have
checked the IRQ and DMA settings for all the boards a hundred times and
flipped just about every setting possible in the BIOS related to the
Plug and Pray Award BIOS along with flashing the newest version, 1.16. I
am at a loss at what to do next. I am about to return the mobo and get a
intel based chipset and/or processor but would rather support AMD and
stay away from Intel whenever possible. I am very pleased with the
performance, 890+ Bogomips.
I saw a comment about the Tyan 1590 mobo posted on the super7
motherboard web site that mentioned that there was a "known" BUG in
either Linux or the BIOS that causes periodic DMA hangs. Is this still
the case? If so, does anyone have a suggestions as to what I can do. I
would love to help squash this bug if someone would head me in the right
direction. I can reproduce the hang rather easily with my sound card. 
Here is what my system looks like. 
Tyan S1990S Super 7 AT motherboard, 1M Cache, 4PCI, 4ISA, 1AGP
AMD K6-3 450mhz CPU
128M PC100 8ns DIMM/SDRAM
COM1 set to IRQ
PCI Slot 1 - Adaptec 2940 SCSI card, P&P to IRQ 15
PCI Slot 2 - Number Nine Vision 330 2M, Set at BIOS to IRQ 10
PCI Slot 3 - Empty
PCI Slot 4 - Empty
ISA Slot 1 - Empty
ISA Slot 2 - Empty
ISA Slot 3 - Empty
ISA Slot 4 - Gravis Ultrasound MAX, Jumpered to IObase 210, loading
module w/ IRQ5, DMA1, DMA5
Linux 2.2.11 
I attached my .config file and the output of my /proc/pci if that helps. 
Thanks,
