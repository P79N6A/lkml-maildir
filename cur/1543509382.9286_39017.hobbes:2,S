Subject: bttv-0.6.4f and kernel bttv merge?

Hello everybody,
I was just wondering if there are any current plans to merge bttv-0.6.4f
(from the XawTV homepage) with existing bttv. Also, are there any plans to
merge 0.6.4f with kernel bttv? if not, what are the reasons for this
delay? I can only guess v4l2. 
I've slowly begun merging 4f and 2.3.16, but i'm still pretty in the dark
on how the two codebases differ. I'm just going through, diff'ing files
and manually kludging things together. It's not to a compilable stage yet,
so i have yet to really shoot myself in the foot =)
Alan, do you think this could be worked in before 2.4? I think the Penguin
Pooba would approve of it, as it's not really feature addition...
Any volunteers that grok this tree, with time on their hands, to
merge/help merge?
Apologies if this has been discussed in the past, but finding searchable
archives of mailing lists makes debugging self-modifying machine code
at runtime seem easy. Real easy. (didn't we all do that when we got our
first microcontrollers to work with, because it was a neat idea? =) )
looking forward to the day when kernel bttv doesn't lock me up,
