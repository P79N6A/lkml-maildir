That's not always best, is it? I've been testing a bit with reiserfs, and
with LOTS of files, I lose performance with a lot of directories compared
to putting all the files in one directory.
Of course, that is only read-performance. Write performance is enhanced
(at least when creating new files) by splitting this into some more
directories. So how you want to split this up depends whether your data is
write-many-read-once or write-once-read-many or something in between. That
is my experience with reiserfs, anyway.
