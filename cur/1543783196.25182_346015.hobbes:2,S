I'd prefer it was 8250_kgdb.c actually - that keeps it along side the
other 8250 files.

ioport_map() is supposed to be used to map the IO range for the ioread/
iowrite operations.  IOW, it takes something compatible with inb() and
friends and converts it to something compatible with ioread8() and
friends.
It does not take a MMIO cookie, so the code above appears to be
conceptually wrong.
