Hi!
Same problem here. I have addressed this issue several times...so far no 
solution.
My specs:
MSI KT3 Ultra2 (VT8235)
TOSHIBA DVD-ROM SD-M1302
YAMAHA CRW8424E
Kernel 2.4.19:
The one I'm currently using. It doesn't detect the VT8235 and therefore 
I have no dma. But I can access/mount my DVD without a problem.
Kernel 2.4.20:
Detects the VT8235 at boot but hangs with my DVD Rom (hdc) --> doesn't 
boot. I have posted my problem here an Alan Cox suggested that I should 
try the -ac tree.
Kernel 2.4.20-ac2:
Some improvements - It detects the VT8235 at boot, also my DVD and CDRW. 
It boots fine and I have DMA on all my discs. But as soon as I try to 
mount a CD/DVD (mount /cdrom) the system hangs and I get this:
hdc: status timeout: status=0xd1 { Busy }
hdc: status timeout: error=0x60LastFailedSense 0x06
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: ATAPI reset timed-out, status=0x80
hdd: DMA disabled
ide1: reset: success
hdc: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
hdc: status timeout: error=0x01IllegalLengthIndication
hdc: ATAPI reset timed-out, status=0xd1
ide1: reset: success
hdc: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
hdc: status timeout: error=0x01IllegalLengthIndication
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 0
hdc: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
and so on...
My guess is the DVD-drive. I know many people with the same southbridge 
(VT8235), who have dma since 2.4.20 an no problem at all at boot-time 
or mounting a CD/DVD.
Any hints?
Patrick
