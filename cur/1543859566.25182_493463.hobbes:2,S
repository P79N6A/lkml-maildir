Correct.

Right; the driver simply can't do anything about it, because the switch
is hardwired to the card and either the card's firmware takes care of
it, or the chipset takes care of it.  The driver has no say whatsoever
in the state of the card's radio for this case.  I tend to think this
case is on it's way out in the same way that fullmac cards are falling
out of favor (ie, do everything in software and save $$$), but they are
around and we need to support them.
In this case, down really does mean down too.  The driver cannot honor
requests to set SSID, frequency, etc, because it's simply not possible
at that time.
