If these cleanups are being generated by a simple script, I would suggest 
making sure that script works before submitting patches which break the 
kernel.  On the other hand, if that script is only being used to point you 
in the direction of a possible cleanup, then it takes very little effort 
to move an asterisk as one person already suggested, get rid of 
whitespace, or make a kzalloc conversion.

When you submit patches to the kernel, I would recommend inspecting each 
line before submitting it.

I'm quite positive life's too short for the people who may apply your 
patch to their tree to deal with trivial typos that cause their compile to 
break or, worse, a problem that may not be noticed at runtime but silently 
manifests itself later.  Having four incremental patches for this: remove 
casts, move asterisks, eliminate whitespace, and kzalloc conversions is 
not the solution.  Roll it into one patch, call it a cleanup, inspect it, 
then _test_ it.
