So moving the flush_cache_mm below the copy_page_range, to just
before the flush_tlb_mm, would work then? This would make the
race much smaller than with this patchset.
But doesn't that still leave a race?
What if another thread writes to cache after we have flushed it
but before flushing the TLBs? Although we've marked the the ptes
readonly, the CPU won't trap if the TLB is valid? There must be
some special way for the arch to handle this, but I can't see it.
