Yep, it's here:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.10pre11aa1/00_silent-stack-overflow-10
I also added the documentation on the locking on top of expand_stack.
My patch also enforced a gap of one page (sysctl configurable in
with page granularity) between a growsdown vma and its previous vma, so
that we can more easily trap stack overflows on the heap. (such part
isn't related to the race fix but it was controversial but since it's
quite useful too I didn't splitted it out :)
