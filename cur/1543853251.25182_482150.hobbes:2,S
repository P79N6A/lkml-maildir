Essentially, the driver model.  (see the answer to your paragraph below.)

Your sentence is confusing - which "remove()" are you talking about
here?  If you're talking about mmc_blk_remove() then that's correct.

Hmm, not sure here.  I think you might be right, but the block layer is
*extremely* finaky when it comes to removing stuff.
In short, I don't know - I've forgotten quite a bit about the low level
block interface with MMC since it's something I did once and only once.
Maybe Jens has some ideas?
