Hi,
I'm sorry that the report falls behind. I wanted to check out by using
real device driver which uses a probe_irq_on(), but I don't have appropriate
environment now.
Though I didn't check out on a real machine yet, I believe my patch doesn't
have any influence on probe_irq_on() because current probe_irq_on() calls
startup callback to unmask the RTEs as you said before.
Regards,
Kenji Kaneshige
