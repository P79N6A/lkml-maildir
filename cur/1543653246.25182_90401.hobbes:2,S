hello all. i am not quite sure if this is the right mailing list for my 
question so dont fire up. i have compiled the kernel 2.4.19 and when i 
shutdown the pc using halt it doesnt poweroff. i tried either with apm 
builtin and module but nothing happened. Bios supports shutfdown since 
2.2.18 did the job and powered off. I use the right gcc and modutils 
version is mentioned in Changes doc. Any ideas will me helpfull thnx allot 
and sorry for my english.
