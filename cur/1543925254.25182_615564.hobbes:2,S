Subject: [patch 2/2] clone: prepare to recycle CLONE_DETACHED and CLONE_STOPPED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/8/232

From: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>
Ulrich says that we never used these clone flags and that nothing should be
using them.
As we're down to only a single bit left in clone's flags argument, let's add a
warning to check that no userspace is actually using these.  Hopefully we will
be able to recycle them.
