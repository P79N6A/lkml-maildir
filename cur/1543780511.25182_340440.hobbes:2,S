Sure it would be renamed (better yet may be a slower page_is_valid()
that doesn't need to use a flag).
There is always the possibility for driver abuse, I guess... however
as it is now, the tree is basically past the critical mass of self
perpetuation (ie. cut-n-paste). So getting rid of that should certianly
help get things cleaner.

Yep, that's done. Actually having a BUG_ON PageReserved in the refcount
functions isn't a bad idea for the initial merge, and should help allay
my fears that I might have introduced refcount leaks on PageReserved
pages.

In that case, remap_pfn_range should take care of it for you by
setting the VM_RESERVED flag on the vma.
Swsusp is the main "is valid ram" user I have in mind here. It
wants to know whether or not it should save and restore the
memory of a given `struct page`.
