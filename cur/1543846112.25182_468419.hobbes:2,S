I think it's both sad, and telling, that the high level of build noise 
has trained kernel hackers to tune out warnings, and/or build tools of 
ever-increasing sophistication just to pick out the useful messages from 
all the noise.
If you have to grep useful stuff out of the noise, you've already lost.
