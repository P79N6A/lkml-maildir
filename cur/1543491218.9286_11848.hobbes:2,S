And if X terminates slowly, SIGKILL goes in few seconds...
I found much more serious bug: xinit sometimes sends SIGKILL to xserver
when terminating. If your machine is under heavy load (make -j zImage) and
you correctly terminate windowmanager (not xserver), xinit kills xserver
with -9 and console is dead.
I think the kernel shouldn't allow users to send unmaskable signals to
suid programs.
