Good. I think you got the point of my sarcasm. My *point* was that we
have two different camps of people here:
* Those who think some solution is better than none.
* Those who want an unobtainable, perfect solution.
I'm not criticising, each has their position. However, I was attempting
to explain that I do fully "get it" by running through an example of how
to work around more elementary on-access scanning schemes. I know that
(no matter what marketing exists to the contrary), it is never possible
to have perfect anti-malware software. But I do think there is a time
and a place for Linux to help make some folks feel safer - on access
file scanning isn't evil, and you don't have to use it! Freedom! :-)
Having spoken to a few people, I've created the following mailing list,
so we can rant away and come up with a list of requirements to present
for further discussion. Note that this is a case where I actually expect
people to be *happy* with yet another email list :-)

Please sign up, and encourage interested third parties to do so too.
Let's work this all out. Then I'll come back sometime over the holidays
with a summary and some followup.

Although I'm open to the idea, I'm almost 100% convinced that nobody is
going to buy modifying userspace applications one at a time. I think
there is a legitimate feeling of this needing to be massaged by the
kernel on some level. But I might be wrong - don't flame me.
Jon.
