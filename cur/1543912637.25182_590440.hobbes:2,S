It's not about default (for which backward compatibility is most important
and this patch is perfectly fine), but user explicitly asks for
"sharecache". In this case if for any reason the cache cannot be shared, I
am not sure if he should get an error back.
I for one agree with Ian and Linus that changing default to nosharecache
might be the best thing to do, but since I am now able to use the latest
kernel, I am very happy already.
Thanks a lot for your attention to my problem. :-)
