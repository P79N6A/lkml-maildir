Firstly make sure you get the patches that make ramfs work if they arent all
yet applied, then build your initrd that populates it on boot. Now you can
make use of the pivot_root() syscall (you may need to generate your own 
syscall wrapper for that one as its very new). That lets you flip your root
and initrd around
