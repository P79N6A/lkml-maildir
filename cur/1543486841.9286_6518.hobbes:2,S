I had the same problem running my k62/350/100Mhz bus speed. You might need a _good_ motherboard
- I strongly reccomend you an EPOX MVP3-C or G because they have temperature monitoring 
system/cooling fan control, some silicone spread between CPU and cooler, and, of course,
the _ultimate_ cooler model, some manufacturers make real 10 cm high turbines. I still don't know
if there are some kernel patches for a /dev/temperature with epox motherboards.
