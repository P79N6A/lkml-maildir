+  Setting this option causes the kernel to use your Promise IDE disk
+  controller as an ordinary IDE controller, rather than as a FastTrak
+  RAID controller (RAID is a system for using multiple physical disks
+  as one virtual disk).
+
+  You need to say Y here if you have one of the above mentioned IDE
+  interfaces,  but either you do not have a RAID disk array,  or you
+  wish to use the Linux internal RAID software (/dev/mdX).
+
+  If you wish to use your Promise controller to control a FastTrak
+  RAID disk array, you need to say Y here AND you you must also say Y
+  to CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID_PDC.
This sounds awful. ;-)
Use controller even if marked as disabled by BIOS
CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE
Say Y unless you want to use Promise proprietary RAID driver.
Makes a lot more sense IMHO.
BTW it needs to be split-up for old and new driver (hint, hint!).

No, they are the same (see drivers/ide/Kconfig).
