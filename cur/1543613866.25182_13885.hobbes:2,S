Having played with it some more, I see it is seriously flawed
in the area of SCSI tape support and locking.  I was probably already pushing
my luck a bit trying to make a hybrid scsi+block driver, and now that
there are per-adapter locks rather than one io_request_lock, it's seems 
quite a lot trickier (perhaps even impossible?) to get such a strange 
beast right.
Anyway, the patch seemed to work upon first trying it, but trying this,
once I managed to get my hands on more than 1 tape drive again, 
  tar cvf /dev/st0 /etc > /dev/null & tar cvf /dev/st1 /etc > /dev/null
(with /dev/st[01] mapping to tape drives on a cciss controller of course)
would quickly demonstrate that patch has big problems.  In case anyone is
trying to use that patch for 2.5.x tree, you should stop using it.  I must
apologize for distributing that kind of garbage, I really should have caught
that earlier.  That the quickly moving kernel tree makes extensive 
testing difficult would be my only and insufficient excuse.
