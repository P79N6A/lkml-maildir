Correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAIK that can only be smoothly used to load 
hardware driver modules.
If the input layer userspace interface code has been compiled as modules, and 
you have a ordinary (not hotplug) device, eg. a gameport joystick, can really 
the hotplug interface be used to load joydev.o when /dev/input/js0 is opened?
I don't use hotplugging that much, so I can't say that I'm sure about what it 
can do, but in my perception of the hotplug system, it can't be used for 
that.
