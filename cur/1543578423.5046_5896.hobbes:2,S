I complained about this ages ago and submitted snippets of PPP
debug output for analysis.  As I recall, the problem was never
resolved and I wound up simply putting "novj" in my PPP config
file:
    /etc/ppp/options
If you'd like to pursue this further, there is a linux-ppp mailing list:
	linux-ppp@vger.kernel.org
I believe this is the PPP maintainer's e-mail address:
	Paul Mackerras <paulus@linuxcare.com>
Best of luck,
	Miles
