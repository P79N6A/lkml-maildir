No, since /usr/include/{linux,asm} are there, they just don't match
with the current kernel. Hmm, perhaps glibc needs to move away from
/usr/include/{linux,asm}. After all, no application should include
linux/* or asm/* right ..
I want
-I/usr/src/linux-2.2.10/include --exclude /usr/src/linux-2.2.10/include/net ;)
Mike.
