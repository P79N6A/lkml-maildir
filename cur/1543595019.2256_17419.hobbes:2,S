I've put it on my ignore list.

It already does that for derivations (in CML1, define_*).  The real problem 
here is that my report generators aren't smart enough to tell when a CML1
symbol is referenced in a CML1 config but never set.  That problem could be
solved, but it's unusual that I don't think it's worth the effort.
