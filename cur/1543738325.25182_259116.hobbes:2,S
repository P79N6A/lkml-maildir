Absolutely.  I mentioned that in a different response in this thread. 
The default behavior on boot up should be for the
arch_init_sched_domains() to build a sched_domains hierarchy that
mirrors the physical layout of the machine for maximal scheduling
efficiency for general computing.  If the users/admin of the machine
want to configure the machine for a particular type(s) of workload, then
they can do that through the soon-to-be-figured-out API to rebuild the
sched_domains hierarchy in their own image and likeness...
