I have mixed feelings about the features of every revision control system I have
seen, but here is a point I can fully concur with. This problem has bitten me with
both SCCS and RCS. Something nasty gets into the tree, and nobody notices. A year
later, when the problem is spotted (probably because the screwed up version is
needed for support purposes) its damned hard to figure out what went wrong. Its
also pretty messy cleaning up the trail of change upon change that will have
followed the original unfortunate incident. I consider this one of the significant
risk factors in using any revision control system.
By the way, aren't most tape backups WOMs?
