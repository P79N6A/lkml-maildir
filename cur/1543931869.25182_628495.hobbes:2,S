BTW: this regression also exists in 2.6.24-rc5. I'll try to find when it 
was introduced but it is hard to do it on a highly critical production 
system, especially since it takes ~2h after a reboot, to be sure.
However, 2h is quite good time, on other systems I have to wait ~2 months 
to get 20MB of leaked memory:
# uptime
  13:29:34 up 58 days, 13:04,  9 users,  load average: 0.38, 0.27, 0.31
# sync;sync;sleep 1;sync;grep Dirt /proc/meminfo
Dirty:           23820 kB
