Ok, but it's up to the programmer and libraries to stay away from system
calls, as they turn the application into a soft real time one anyway.

That's what I was afraid of... Cannot this be fixed in any reasonable
way? (Is it related to dynamic stack allocation?)

Does this need to be handled without losing the RT timing, or is it
"just" a matter of handling it to keep RT an error condition from
causing a bad crash?

What's the biggest problems here? Too much context info to keep track of
in order to separate RT from standard Linux? I'll have a closer look at
the low level areas of the standard scheduling code to get a better idea
of what's going in, but I'm not expecting a pleasant surprize...
