Trying to get my Asus M2NPV-VM motherboard and my
Samsung SyncMaster 215tw Digital to work in 1680x1050
mode but 1280x1024 is the most I can get. Chip Set is
GeForce 6150.
Looking in Xorg.0.log it ssems to think that the panel
size is 1280x1024 in spite of my setting telling it
differently.
Sorry if this is off topic but I thought that the
smart people would be here. In Windows I just plug it
in and it works. So I figure Linux should work too. :)
