Nobody suggested to not add "an airbag" by default.
Infact the polling isn't an airbag at all, when you poll you're flying
so you never need an airbag at all, only when you're on the ground you
may need the airbag.
Another thing I said recently is that the hardirq airbag have nothing to
do with softirqs, and that's right. Patch messing the softirq logic in
function of the hardirq airbag are just totally broken or at least
confusing because incidentally merged together by mistake.
