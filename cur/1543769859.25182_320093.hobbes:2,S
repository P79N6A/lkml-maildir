/dev/vcsa != /dev/vcs !!!!
There are two different devices, as far as I remember, one is only for
the characters itself on the console, and one includes attributes as well ...
FYI Documentation/devices.txt:
0 = /dev/vcs          Current vc text contents
                  1 = /dev/vcs1         tty1 text contents
[...]
                128 = /dev/vcsa         Current vc text/attribute contents
                129 = /dev/vcsa1        tty1 text/attribute contents
