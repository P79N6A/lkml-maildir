Here are some monitoring tools that might help detect the cause of
the situation.
bloatmon is the "back end"; there's no reason to run it directly.
bloatmeter shows the "least utilized" slabs.
bloatmost shows the largest slabs.
These sort of make for a top(1) for "lowmem pressure". Not everything
is accounted there, though. The missing pieces are largely
(1) simultaneous temporary poll table allocations
(2) pmd's
(3) kernel stacks
