The problem is on module unload: is it possible for CPU1 to be
on "do something", and sleep, and, while it sleeps, CPU2 does
rmmod(lsm), so that by the time CPU1 stops sleeping, the code it
is executing has been freed?
Because stacker won't remove the lsm from the list of modules
until mod->exit() is executed, and module_free(mod) happens
immediately after that, the above scenario seems possible.
