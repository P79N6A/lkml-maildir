Quite interesting, as I occassionally have short "drumbeat" on the PC 
speaker. It is like \e[10;x]\e[11;15], but seems irreproducible to me with 
any particular x. I do not suspect overheating, as the BIOS hardware 
monitor has shown 51 deg Celsius after some hours running for over two 
years now.

MB is EliteGroup L7S7A2, CPU is AMD Athlon XP 2000+, and 
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/ is empty. LM chip is a LM78, but lmsensors outputs 
only rubbish data.
