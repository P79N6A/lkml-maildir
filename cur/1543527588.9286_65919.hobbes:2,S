   You need to watch out for the problem that programs print messages to
   stdout or stderr without checking first whether fd 0, 1, 2 actually were
   open when the program was started. If some init variant opens /dev/console,
   and dups the fd twice to get 0,1,2 all will be fine with a console, but
   without a console programs may be called without good stdout and stderr.
   If now mount or e2fsck or some other program opens a disk device, and
   later prints something it may be printed to your disk instead of screen.
I don't know about mount, but e2fsck has had defensive coding to prevent
exactly this problem since version 1.13.
