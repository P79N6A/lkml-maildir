Actually that v3 patch does not do bad blocks remapping in case of
write failure, it only does remapping when you manually ask it.
And biggest part of badblocks support in reiser3 is in reiserfsck and tools
(and in not that bad shape, last time I looked).
As for remapping bad blocks on write failure, the only PC OS that was doing
this that comes to my mind is Novell Netware (I think they called it a "hotfix"
or something like that).
