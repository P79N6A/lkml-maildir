Sort of coming in in the middle of this because I just realized this may have 
something to do with the "exception Emask" errors. I have an NF2, and the 
above 0: type is what I'm getting with, or without, the apparently opposite 
kernel argument, acpi_use_timer_override.  Should I instead be seeing 0: as 
shown below?  If so, what do I change to effect this?  My current .config:
[root@coyote linux-2.6.24]# grep HPET .config
CONFIG_HPET_TIMER=y
CONFIG_HPET_EMULATE_RTC=y
CONFIG_HPET=y
# CONFIG_HPET_RTC_IRQ is not set
# CONFIG_HPET_MMAP is not set
Thanks.
