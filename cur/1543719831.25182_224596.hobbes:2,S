You're requesting to add and maintain data to feed a tool that catches 
only trivially visible recursion. I don't want to waste mine and your time 
explaining why your tool will never work, but if you want an hint, you can 
start thinking about all functions that sets/pass callbacks and/or sets 
operational functions. I don't know if you noticed that, but Linux is 
heavily function-pointer driven. Eg, one function setups a set of function 
pointers, and another 317 indirectly calls them. Having such comments, not 
only makes the maintainance heavier, but gives the false sense of safeness 
that once you drop that data in, you're protected against recursion.
