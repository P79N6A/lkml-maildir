That was fixed long ago (by having a 4 byte reserved field in the middle) that
we can do a two byte jump and then do a farther jump from there to the 16bit
code.  So as long as we actually use discipline and really reserve
the field for a further jump there should be no need for 0x281 being the end
of the universe.
