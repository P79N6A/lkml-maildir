That's true, but it is not fud to say that kerneldoc is only any good
if people keep it accurate and up to date, and this is what I think
Rusty is upset about.
I personally don't like kerneldoc at all, because the truth is that
people will work on fixing bugs and other userful things before
keeping kerneldoc up to date.
And that's the basic fact which cannot be denied.
I wish it could work, but it doesn't across the board.  So unless
we have dedicated monkeys scouring over every single patch that
goes into the tree and doing the necessary kerneldoc updates,
kerneldoc will be chronically wrong somewhere.
That leads to confusion and lost developer time.  Because if the
kerneldoc bits are wrong, it's worthless.
