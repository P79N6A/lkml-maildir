Back again: Kernel 2.6.12.6 works well for my system.
Compiling the most ~similar 2.6.14 selections as 2.6.12.6 is not
recognizing the 8131 chipset.
(I'm using default values for all new modules)
lsmod shows mostly the same result.
Any suggestion or reasons for "no longer supported 8131"?

Most probably you have module/kernel version mismatch.

Apparently support for the 8131 was added sometime before 2.8.11 kernel
release.

Take knoppix's .config and compile latest 2.6 using it (with "make
oldconfig"
step as usual).
