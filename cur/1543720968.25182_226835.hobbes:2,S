Yes, correctly configured board port for 405EP can be build without PCI support.

Did you make board port yourself? The reason I'm asking is none of Linux PPC 
trees has support for board you mentioned. So it's quite unlikely that Linux PPC 
kernel can be used on your hardware as is.
.config file doesn't look correct, it enables support for EP405 board (Embedded 
Plannet 405GP based board).
CONFIG_BIOS_FIXUP is set arch/ppc/platforms/4xx/Kcoonfig on per board basis.
Also, I'd recommend asking questions about 405EP on linuxppc-embedded list, not 
here. This will increase probability of you getting some help :).
