Turns out that the aacraid driver in 2.6.22.x is HORRIBLY BROKEN (when
you pull a drive); it responds to MD's write requests with uptodate=1
(in raid1_end_write_request) for the drive that was pulled!  I've not
looked to see if aacraid has been fixed in newer kernels... are others
aware of any crucial aacraid fixes in 2.6.23.x or 2.6.24?
After the drive was physically pulled, and small periodic writes
continued to the associated MD device, the raid1 MD driver did _NOT_
detect the pulled drive's writes as having failed (verified this with
systemtap).  MD happily thought the write completed to both members
(so MD had no reason to mark the pulled drive "faulty"; or mark the
raid "degraded").
Installing an Adaptec-provided 1.1-5[2451] driver enabled raid1 to
work as expected.
That said, I now have a recipe for hitting the raid1 deadlock that
Tanaka first reported over a week ago.  I'm still surprised that all
of this chatter about that BUG hasn't drawn interest/scrutiny from
others!?
