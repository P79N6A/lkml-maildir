If the filesystem is located on a separate partition, that should be doable
(not that I'm going to try it in the foreseeable future).

I don't agree.

Can we just take the interface down and bring it up just for writing the image,
possibly with another IP address?  We don't need another kernel to do
that.

Yes, that can happen in theory (and I believe it's happend for some XFS
users), but _most_ often it just works and people are used to doing it.

Yes.

The problem here is that you can't just anticipate everything and sometimes
you need to add hacks to handle problems that you have not anticipated.
I'm not sure if you're able to avoid adding hacks within the kexec-based
approach.

Do you realize how much time would it take to implement that?

Not that much, IMO, but that's not the issue.  The issue is that for the
kexec-based approach to work you'll need the devices to be quiesced properly.

Yes, but that's not what's going on today.  So first, let's fix that.

You are probably right.
Now, I think that your idea boils down to freezing the kernel along with all
tasks, which is reasonable, albeit extreme. :-)
I think we can consider doing something like this in the long run, but at
present we are not ready to do that.
Besides, I wouldn't like to drop the existing infrastructure that people use
and start over at some other place, because that would be wasteful.  Instead,
I'd prefer to improve the existing approach gradually, in such a way that
new code is added in a more-or-less transparent way (of course it's difficult
to avoid breaking things from time to time, but doing small steps it's easier
to fix bugs along the way).
