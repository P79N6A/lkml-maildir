Hi, I have a question about netlink socket.
It can be a 'stupid' question, but I need help about it.
The question is : 
"Does it matter to change endian in netlink socket communication?"
Usually there is no endian-transition code in netlink socket program,
but netlink socket is also 'socket', so I think when I want to use 
netlink communication, I have to use endian transition, but no one did it! :)
I'm testing netlink socket for Traffic Control (TC) in MPC8250, 
which is a Motorola PowerPC based CPU.  
TC works good in normal Pentium-based PC, 
but it doesn't look working very well on MPC8250 -  Traffics cannot recognize
their own filters when running through the linux router.  
So I wonder whether this problem is related to netlink endian transition.
Is there anybody who has tested netlink socket in PPC-based platform?
Thanks.
