No it doesn't; it overloads page->index. Its just used as extra return
value, it need not be persistent. Definitely not worth a page-flag.

I can't see how. This extra ALLOC_MIN|ALLOC_HIGH|ALLOC_HARDER alloc will
first deplete all other zones. Once that starts failing no node should
still have pages accessible by any allocation context other than
PF_MEMALLOC.

It has to; since it can serve the allocation from a pre-existing slab
allocation. Hence any page allocation must be valid for all other users.

Yes, it keeps slabs on per node lists. I'm just not seeing how this puts
hard constraints on the allocations.
As far as I can see there cannot be a hard constraint here, because
allocations form interrupt context are at best node local. And node
affine zone lists still have all zones, just ordered on locality.

hit it with PF_MEMALLOC. If the page allocation doesn't use ALLOC_CPUSET
the page can come from pretty much anywhere.
