I mean "in current kernel" (I checked it in 2.6.22)

You read wrong part of the include file. Really, it is 
(2.6.22,include/asm-i386/system.h):
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE
#define wmb() alternative("lock; addl $0,0(%%esp)", "sfence", 
X86_FEATURE_XMM)
#else
#define wmb()   __asm__ __volatile__ ("": : :"memory")
#endif
CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE is dependent on MWINCHIP3D || MWINCHIP2 || MWINCHIPC6
--- so on Intel and AMD, it is really just barrier().
So drivers can't assume that wmb() works on write-combining memory.

Because it is defined as __asm__ __volatile__ ("": : :"memory")
And WC memory can reorder writes (WB memory can't).

I mean this: wmb() assumes that the data to be ordered are not in WC 
memory. rmb() assumes that the data can be in WC memory (lfence is only 
useful on WC --- it doesn't have any effect on other memory types).
