In our project (The Umbrella Project) we are maintaining a system call 
for making a "restricted fork" (which could e.g. be that the child 
created will have no access to the network)... it is a very annoying job 
to keep the patch up to date with the new kernel versions because the 
syscall files are changed often. The rest of the Umbrella module is 
independent because it is based on LSM ... so having dynamic syscalls is 
definitly a wish of ours!
Best, Kristian Sørensen.
