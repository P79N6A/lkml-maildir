Oh. That could really be a problem.. I though having two different
connectors on the board would make two different buses..
I must have been wrong.

Okay, so far I understood.

It is.

It seems like it is impossible:

No. And that's the real problem.
I can see the following:
2 - 1 -0 for the id (every one with two pins), NC (one pin).
Under the device is a small claviar.
I mean a small think, a bank with small switches on it.
reading from left to right:
1 - 2 -3 -  4 -5 -6 -7 -8.
If the switch is up, it is on.

| o  |   on

I hope you understand what I mean to say with thoses ascii figures.
Does anybody know what to do with these
switches ?
Nico
ps: oh, you are from hp, that's the reason why you know so much about this
device ;)
