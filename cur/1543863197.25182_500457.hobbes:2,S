Huh?
What are possible values of that variable? What happens if it is set/unset?
I'd suppose that if it is set, you get the old format, but that isn't clear.

Same as above.

I don't see an upgrade path here that doesn't involve keeping cruft "new
feature is on" variables around indefinitely... Why not just a repository
version?

I suppose "git add ." works for 'adding everything' only at the top?

Why not tell about "git add -i"?

Where is such a branch rooted?

Does this leave you on that branch, or still in limbo?

What happens if there are changes in the tracked files?

A bit of detail on how to specify shallowness would be nice here...
Very nice work, thanks!
