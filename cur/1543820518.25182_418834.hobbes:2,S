Probably fewer cases and less time than you suspect, respectively.
Just as C++ gives you tools, C does too, but far more important than
language tools is the discipline used when writing code: discipline to
think through the code, to structure it rationally, and to reuse the
rational structures that others have devised in the past.  C++ gives
you well-tested helper classes to manage object locking.  Linux gives
you its own well-tested examples of known and tried design patterns.
