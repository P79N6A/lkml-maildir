I think there are situations in which it can be justified, like:
- The driver is not entirely finished, but we want to merge it early, because
of many potential users,
- The driver has only a few users who aren't interested in the suspend/resume
functionality,
- The device is undocumented and we don't know how to make it handle the
suspend/resume (we may learn that in the future or not).
For this reason I 100% agree that we should _encourage_ implementing .suspend
and .resume, but we should not make it an unbreakable rule cast in stone.
Greetings,
Rafael
