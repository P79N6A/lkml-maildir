I have read Vincent Touquet  about the Tyan motherboard and 
the 3ware problems that cause a lockup. He believes that 
this is due to dma causing the PCI bus to overload and then 
the system crashes. I am running a similar system with 
a National Semiconducotrs GigaBit Card and then there is a 
3-ware card with 12 disks on it. I believe to fix this 
problem is to use dma=off as a boot option. Does anyone have 
another idea, or an exact idea why lockups like this happen?
I have not as of yet used the dma=off option myself. 
thank you
