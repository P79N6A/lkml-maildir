Hi Eric!
	They always could, of course, they just wouldn't get correct alignment.
I think the principle of least surprise says that if we support this, it
will also work in modules...

Not quite.  We allocate a total amount of per-cpu memory at boot, then
anything left over gets used for per-cpu vars in modules.
Looking at the module per-cpu code again, the rounding up of the memory
used by the kernel seems unnecessary though.  I'll try ripping that
out...

Really?  I can't see that.
It did look like the x86-64 setup_per_cpu_areas should be moved into
common code though (it's numa-aware).  Maybe that breaks some platforms.
It means the x86 cpu_pda initialization would have to be done in
smp_prepare_boot_cpu tho...
Cheers!
Rusty.
