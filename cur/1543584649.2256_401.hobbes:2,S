I did not ever say that it depends on the kernel. The kernel _has to_ depend on
_standards_ coz otherwise it wouldn't be POSIX compliant, it wouldn't obey one

The kernel is faulty, and it has to use &h0D as CARRIAGE RETURN, whenever this
behaviour seems expactable (stress on -able).

_I_ am not talking about perl coz in my eyes this is waste. But there are numerous
other programmes with problems on it, too.
