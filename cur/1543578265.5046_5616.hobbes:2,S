Hi,
I don't know if it's possible to make fd a read-only device if the 
inserted media is write-protected, but I had a strange problem:
I had inserted a write protected floppy and accessed it via autofs as 
vfat in 2.2.18. It worked. Some time later it had expired (and I'm not 
sure whether I had changed floppies in the meantime).
When I tried an "mdel a:*", it did terminate without message, but a 
later "mdir a:" showed all the files there. The kernel had 
unsuccessfully tried to write to the floppy however.
It's a bit hard to reproduce that, but I could guess that the disc-
change ore write-protect status was not updated in some case.
Maybe it rings some bell for one of you; if not, never mind.
Regards,
Ulrich
