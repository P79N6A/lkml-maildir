Subject: [PATCH] radix-tree pagecache for 2.4.19-pre2-ac2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have uploaded an updated version of the radix-tree pagecache patch
against 2.4.19-pre2-ac2.  News in this release:
* fix a deadlock when vmtruncate takes i_shared_lock twice by introducing
  a new mapping->page_lock that mutexes mapping->page_tree. (akpm)
* move setting of page->flags back out of move_to/from_swap_cache. (akpm)
* put back lost page state settings in shmem_unuse_inode. (akpm)
* get rid of remove_page_from_inode_queue - there was only one caller. (me)
* replace add_page_to_inode_queue with ___add_to_page_cache. (me)
Please give it some serious beating while I try to get 2.5 working and
port the patch over 8)
