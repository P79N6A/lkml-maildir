Recently, mozilla has been popping up the timidity midi translator 
panel to play the music from some sites.
Everything seems to work, except the speakers are silent.  Running 
2.6.0-test9-mm2.
On Topic: Things to check in the 2.6.0-test9-mm2 kernel config?
Changes in 2.6 that might fubar this?
TBF, I haven't used timidity for so long I don't recall if it worked 
before 2.6.
I'm seeing an occasional line or 3 like this in the logs, no idea if 
its related:
via_audio: ignoring drain playback error -11
via_audio: ignoring drain playback error -11
via_audio: ignoring drain playback error -11
via82cxxx: timeout while reading AC97 codec (0x9A0000)
