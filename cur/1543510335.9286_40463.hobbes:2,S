Hi,
I am not a "kernel god" but in case you are also interested in opinions of
ordinary mortals - 
excellent idea! The only arguments against it that I heard were "ah, but
we build embedded Linux system and every byte of memory is important".
This argument is not serious and should receive a decent reply such as
"touch, in'it?".
Also, all your suggestions seem excellent but I would add something
slightly more radical but, imho, also useful. How about making /proc also
mounted automatically? Sure, one can also manually mount it elsewhere as
many times as one wants but ensuring that /proc is *always* there at
/proc seems a good idea. The specific location "/proc" is part of some
standard (can't remember which) so it is not too bad to hardcode it.
Regards,
Tigran.
