	While trying to track down some problems with my old i486 dropping ppp
	packets, I ran into some anomalies with /proc/ide.
	I have 4 IDE drives and I noticed that /proc/hd[ac]/geometry reports a
	negative physical cylinder count while /proc/hd[bd]/geometry reports
	positive values. The logical geometries are correct. Is this a problem?
No.
The patch below will make them positive again, I suppose.
(this is on /usr/src/linux/drivers/block/ide-proc.c or so)
