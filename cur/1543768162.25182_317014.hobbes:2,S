It seems to work. I've tested it for a few hours on the same machine
and the 2 nice 0 processes take the bulk of the cpu time, while that
cpu bound program running at nice 19 takes only about 7%.
Maybe it's a bit early to say it's fine, but it does semm much better
than before, so I think it should go into the tree.
Thanks a lot!
