In scripts/Kbuild.include line 26 is empty and line 29 is a comment... Do I 
look at the wrong place?
I still believe in my version: built-in.o is built if any of $(obj-y) $(obj-m) 
$(obj-n) $(obj-) $(lib-target) contains anything in scripts/Makefile.build 
line 77. As scripts/Makefile.lib line 29 filters the only target the object 
file is not built.

I just generated a patch [0] against vanilla 2.6.21 with latest mac80211 and 
iwlwifi from git. Get my config [1] and you should get my error.
