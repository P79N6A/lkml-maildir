Hello!
In -mm4 ACPI suspend to ram (echo -n mem >/sys/power/state) no longer
suspends my centrino laptop. This used to work in -mm3.
It fails to suspend "radeonfb" (which isn't active BTW, fbcon is not
loaded but radeonfb is compiled in).
 I have attached a photo of the suspend message.
Please note that on this laptop ACPI always used to suspend the machine.
It just never wakes up :)
And that's the reason i follow the latest -mm patches. I still hope
*some* day suspend/resume will work ;)
Thought i'd share this.
Dateils of the laptop (dmesg, lspci) can be found here:
