You're right. I reverted this one two days ago and got a working
system. Actually, the system had other problems (got an oops when
reading /proc/ioports). But they might be caused by dependencies
between Grekgh's PCI patches that were still applied and and the
one I removed, right ?
Anyway, this fixed my maestro3 divide error and the yenta hang
during boot.
