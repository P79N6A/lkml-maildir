 Well, this is actually the bit that made cancel_work_sync() be written in 
the first place.  The short story is the netlink lock is most probably 
held at this point (depending on the usage of phy_disconnect()) and there 
is also an event waiting in the queue that requires the lock, so if 
flush_scheduled_work() is called here a deadlock will happen.
 Let me find a reference for a longer story...:
