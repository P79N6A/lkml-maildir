What you're saying is clear.
But I'm a little bit confused...what about the lot of definitions that use __REG or __REG2 macros to define registers address
(inside imx-regs.h, pxa-regs.h and so on) ?

How should I choose the value of that costant ?
Please suggest me.

The standards are more or less to avoid creating namespace clutter,
and to make explicit where register access happens.  Defining new
macros violates the former; not being able to tell where the chip
registers are accessed (because they're wrapped in macros) violates
the latter.

Pick a constant, use it.

That's how I read it.  :)

I think it's correct; it's certainly standard for converting physical
addresses to DMA addresses.  (Andrew got that one wrong; resource
addresses are physical, not virtual.)
