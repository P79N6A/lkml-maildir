Hi Andi, thanks for your comment.

We can avoid the problem by the simple solution, since SMP
on 386 boxes isn't supported. It is to disable interrupt
while updating atomic_t variable.
The attached patch modifies the include/asm-i386/atomic.h.
If the target processor is 386, then atomic_add_return() use
non-atomic operations between local_irq_disable() and local_irq_enable().
Otherwise, atomic_add_return() use 'xadd' operation with LOCK prefix.
By the way, do you know why 'xadd' operation is used
unconditionally in 'include/asm-i386/rwsem.h'?
Thanks.
