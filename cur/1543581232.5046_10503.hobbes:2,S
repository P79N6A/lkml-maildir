Ok, then let's go into a bit more details.
First, the part of the dmesg concerning the network interfaces:

eepro100.c: $Revision: 1.36 $ 2000/11/17 Modified by Andrey V. Savochkin <saw@saw.sw.com.sg> and others

Please note: the "Receiver lock-up workaround activated." message is printed
now only since I applied my patch. Before, only the "enabling work-around." part
appeared, which is a bit tricky.
Second, attached to this mail is an mrtg graph png. Beware that the timeline goes
from right to left. This covers the past week. Every day the big peak is the
midnight "masturbation rush" when nearly everyone connects at the same time to
browse pr0n sites. You'll notice that the midnight peak is castrated suddenly
last friday. This accident happened 3 times the previous week. Kind of frustrating.
You can see a kind of sudden blackout which lasts about 3 hours, and then the
situation resumes to normality.
At the same time, the /var/log/messages receives thousands of messages from the
NET: subsystem.
A rather long research on the various mailing lists and newsgroups about networking
shows that this behavior is shown the same way on systems using a bugged Intel EtherExpress
Pro 100 network card.
Since the dmesg of the kernel tells about a work-around for such a bug, I was assuming
that the work around was activated, but I had a doubt and after looking at the source,
I discovered that it wasn't.
On saturday I patched the kernels, and since the midnight peaks are no longer
broken, there is no more desperate messages from the NET subsystem in the logs,
so maybe the problem has been fixed.
Now, as Ion says, maybe it is not the "receiver lock-up bug" itself which is
worked-around, frankly I don't know.
