An IDE struct device is the gendev embedded in the ide_drive_t.  Its parent
is the ide_hwif_t, and its parent is the PCI device (or maybe SBUS
or whatever).  You can see this in /sys:
$ ls /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.1/ide0/0.0
block  detach_state  power
The '0.0' is the device with an ide_bus_type.  ide0 is the hwif.
0000:00:1f.1 is a pci_dev.  Or in ACPI terms, ACPI/_SB/PCI0/IDEC
is ide0 and ACPI/_SB/PCI0/IDEC/PRID is 0.0
At least, I think that's the mapping.  Are we ever going to do anything
with /sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ or will it just stay around consuming
inodes and dentries for no good reason?

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
