Subject: git tree with VFS stuff

I've created a git tree with the following mounts related stuff:
  - read-only bind mounts
  - /proc/<pid>/mountinfo
  - unprivileged mounts
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mszeredi/vfsstuff.git master
I guess, giving these a spin in linux-next wouldn't hurt?
Thanks,
Miklos
