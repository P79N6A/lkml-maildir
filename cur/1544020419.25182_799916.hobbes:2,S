(the patch: 
http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=3702
)
Well, perhaps something like your patch makes sense.
	+/*
	+ * A single thread is exiting, and it is the leader of the group.
	+ * This coresponds to the main thread calling pthread_exit.
	+ * In this case, the persists until all the other
	+ * threads call pthread_exit, or someone calls exit or _exit.
	+ * To implement this case, we park the thread leader in
	+ * a loop which waits until the thread list becomes empty,
	+ * or it receives a fatal signal.
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The comment is not exactly right, we return on every signal, not only fatal.
	+int
	+do_leader_exit(void)
	+{
	+	int ret = 0;
	+
	+	if (unlikely(!thread_group_empty(current))) {
	+		DECLARE_WAITQUEUE(wait, current);
	+
	+		add_wait_queue(&current->signal->wait_chldexit, &wait);
	+
	+		set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
	+
	+		do {
	+			if (thread_group_empty(current))
	+				break;
	+
	+			try_to_freeze();
	+			schedule();
	+			if (signal_pending(current))
	+				ret = -ERESTARTSYS;
	+		} while (ret == 0);
	+
	+		remove_wait_queue(&current->signal->wait_chldexit, &wait);
	+
	+		__set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
	+	}
	+
	+	return ret;
	+}
the above is just the open-coded
wait_event_interruptible(&current->signal->wait_chldexit,
				thread_group_empty(current));
	 asmlinkage long sys_exit(int error_code)
	 {
	+	if (thread_group_leader(current)) {
	+		int ret = do_leader_exit();
	+		if (ret != 0)
	+			return ret;
	+	}
		do_exit((error_code&0xff)<<8);
	 }
afaics, -ERESTARTSYS is not exactly correct. We can dequeue the
signal without SA_RESTART. But we never should abort sys_exit().
ERESTARTNOINTR is better. But see below.
I am worried this patch can confuse the user-space. Because, when
the main thread does sys_exit(), the user-space has all rights
to assume it exits ;) But with this patch the main thread will
continue to handle the signals until the while group exits, I'm
afraid libpthread.so won't be happy.
And what if the signal handler does siglongjmp() and aborts sys_exit() ?

And I think gdb is wrong. It can see this process has other live threads,
and attach to them. I didn't check gdb, but iirc "strace -f" works
correctly in this case.
I cced other people. Let's see what they think.
