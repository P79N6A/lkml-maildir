For basic sanity, could this please be a standard backlight driver 
rather than sticking yet another backlight control under yet another 
directory in /proc? It makes userspace much, much easier. 
drivers/video/backlight/corgi_bl.c is an example, but also see my posts 
to acpi-devel with patches that add it to existing acpi drivers.

What buttons does the hardware have? Would it make more sense for it to 
be an input driver rather than (or as well as) just dropping stuff in 
acpi/events?
