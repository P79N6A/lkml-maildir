I see some shortcomings :
How will you handle multiple users ?
Janice and Bob have accounts on the Linux client and both want to have 
access at the same time to their [Home] for example :
|-- DOM1 --|-- Machine4--|--[Home]
How will you handle users with multiple logins on a Domain/Machine ?
Maybe you'd be better starting with something like :
local_user_home_directory--|--smb--|--login--|--WGx/DOMy--|....
user's could provide something like a ".smbwalker.config"
with lines like
login_to_try    how_to_get_credential
local_user_home_directory--|--smb could be mounted by automount or 
mounted/umounted on first login/end of last session
