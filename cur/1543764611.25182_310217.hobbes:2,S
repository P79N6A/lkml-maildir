I don't think it's efficient per se, but I think it's important that 
people can just "pass the files along". Ie it's a huge benefit if any 
everyday mirror script (whether rsync, wget, homebrew or whatever) will 
just automatically do the right thing.

I much prefer to waste some CPU time to save disk cache. Especially since 
the compression is "free" if you do it early on (ie it's done only once, 
since the files are stable). Also, if the difference is a 1.5GB kernel 
repository or a 3GB kernel repository, I know which one I'll pick ;)
Also, I don't want people editing repostitory files by hand. Sure, the 
sha1 catches it, but still... I'd rather force the low-level ops to use 
the proper helper routines. Which is why it's a raw zlib compressed blob, 
not a gzipped file.
