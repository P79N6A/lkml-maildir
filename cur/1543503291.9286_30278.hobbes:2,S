It's a known problem: most of the Rhine chips don't work in PCI memory mode.
I didn't know about this issue earlier, so the v1.01 driver uses
I/O mode for the x86 and memory mapped mode for other architectures.
[[ Hmmm, I should have caught the clue when I ported this driver to the
PowerPC and I had to use I/O mode. ]]
The work-around is to use -DVIA_USE_IO when compiling the module.
This will be the default for all architectures in future versions:
