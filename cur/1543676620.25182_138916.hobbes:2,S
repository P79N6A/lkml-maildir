   - refuse to open any more vccs; fail all attempts to send packets
My personal feeling is that there should be a way to zombie
VCCs, precisely for such events.
ATM should unlink them immediately, and mark them dead.
Anything that tries to do something with a VCC should
check that it is still alive.
With something like this you can ensure that a driver does
not get called into anymore.
It is just my non-ATM-expert opinion :-)
