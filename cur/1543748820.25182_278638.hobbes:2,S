I do not see how it should accumulate. Lets have working TSC. You want
to emulate fixed-period timer with single-shot timer.
int should_fire_at;
void handle_single_shot()
{
	int delay;
retry:n
	should_fire_at += loops_per_second/HZ
	delay = should_fire_at - get_tsc();
	if (delay < 0)
		goto retry;
	do_single_shot_in(delay);
}
I'm not sure what's broken with compensation code, but using
single-shot timer is not broken in theory.

Yes, java is bad, but using patents against it is evil, too. Plus
python does not yet run on my cellphone ;-).
