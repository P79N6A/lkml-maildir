While this is 100% correct, the bit which raised my attention was the
original message which didn't seem to show that the above had been
considered.
The thing that worries me is that an incorrect strlcpy() conversion
gives the impression that someone has thought about buffer underruns
as well as overruns, and, unless someone /has/ actually thought about
it, there could well still be a security problem lurking there.
I'm just overly wary of all strlcpy() conversions.
