Most likely, but that doesn't imply that Windows XP works with ancient
ata drives.

My guess is yes, but I'll also bet the drive vendors have not tested
this path well.

The best solution is probably to make it user selectable for now.  I
know we need the reset/set features, or any sort of error causes a
major melt down. We can default to the current behaviour, so it
shouldn't break anything.
I'll make sure some patches for this are created sometime in the next
couple of months.  I'll even try to make sure TCQ gets tested with
them if TCQ works well enough with the current code.
