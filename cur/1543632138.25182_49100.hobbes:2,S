	  Hello Andre and LKML!
I just pulled a copy of Marcello's tree from bk and compiled it on my sparc
(that's a sun ultra 5). Everything went well but the IDE.
I have a large ide disk connected to this guy (around 120GB if memory
serves) and it used to work properly in the 2.4.17 era.
Now when I boot, I got this:

Right now I'm recompiling the kernel without DMA to see it changes
anything.
If you need anything from me, be my guest.
Cheers, Mathieu.

    It is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is a
                      proper judge of it.
