Disregarding the fact that a large amount of your power consumption is
	LCD backlight
	Memory
	Disk spinning
the CPU (and to an extent thus the fan) part of the power consumption
reduces approximately linearly with the clock speed drop and also the
square of the voltage drop. There is an ever growing static component
with newer chips but even so its quite measurable done right.
Now we have the cpu speed code we can look at implementing something
like idleness is not sloth properly, and trying to keep the CPU in low
speed modes whenever possible.
