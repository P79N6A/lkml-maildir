This is a bad idea.  From linux/fs.h:
#undef NR_OPEN
#define NR_OPEN (1024*1024)     /* Absolute upper limit on fd num */
There isn't anything I can see guaranteeing that net/scm.h is included 
before fs.h.  This affects networking and should really be Cc'd to 
netdev@vger.kernel.org, which will raise the issue that if SCM_MAX_FD is 
raised, the resulting simple kmalloc() must be changed.  That said, I 
doubt SCM_MAX_FD really needs to be raised, as applications using many 
file descriptors are unlikely to try to send their entire file table to 
another process in one go -- they have to handle the limits imposed by 
SCM_MAX_FD anyways.
