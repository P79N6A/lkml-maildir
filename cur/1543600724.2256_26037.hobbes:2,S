Unfortunately, it is not that simple:
(From rpld-1.7/README:)
RPLD implements the IBM RIPL protocol, used to network boot some
machines. It
DOES NOT implement the Novell style RPL/IPX protocol.  If your are not
sure
which protocol you are using see the section "Troubleshooting".
And, indeed, it does not work with Novell bootrom. If you have
different version, please let me know...
