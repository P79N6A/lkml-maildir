I use FAI (
http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/
) to install servers
here. They use ip=dhcp in order to have nfs-root, then they run dhclient
in order to get dns and to maintain the lease correctly (not sure the
kernel does this for you). I don't loose contact with the nfs server,
works just fine.
