Hi!
sorry if this problem is off topic.
I just tried to complile mysql 3.22.27,but every time i got the
following error:
c++: Internal compiler error: program cc1plus got fatal signal 9
make[3]: *** [sql_yacc.o] Error 1
i'm using slackware 7,kernel 2.3.30pre6. but if i  use kernel 2.2.13ac3
or 2.2.14pre11
i'll get such an error,"Virtual memory exhausted"
My PC has 64M RAM and 133M swap space. the source file( sql-yacc.cc) is
very
large(about 8600 lines), but i think it impossible to use all ram.
Why? Is it kernel related or the C++ compiler's problem?
Thank you!
