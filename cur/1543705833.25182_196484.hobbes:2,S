This fix doesn't work for me because I get problems if I disable ACPI IRQ 
routing and still have apic enabled. Normally these problems would be 
gracefully solved, but my USB HCD complains about not having been assigned an 
IRQ.
This ACPI problem is definitely present in mainline, so this is a regression 
at least on my nForce 2.
If this is helpful, in 2.6.2-rc1-mm1 I would see:
..MPBIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC.
This error seemed to be harmless and made no difference to the kernel while 
booting. It's been like that since latter 2.5 kernels, so that's quite a long 
time. The board is an EPoX 8RDA+ in case this is a vendor bug.
Now, instead, I see (in 2.6.2 and 2.6.2-mm1):
IOAPIC[0]: Invalid reference to IRQ 0
Later my kernel hangs when detecting hde, as described in another thread.
pci=noacpi allows me to get to init, but it breaks my USB HCD.
