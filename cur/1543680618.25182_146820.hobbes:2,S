No, for two reasons.  First, anything can be aliased by a char.  Second,
the restriction is on the type of the eventual memory reference,
not on the type of the pointer.  Assuming an int* p, you can still do 
*((char*)p) and
that may alias anything.  So you must check each dereference; this 
can't be
done easily at function entry.
