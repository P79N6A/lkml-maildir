Which does the user "need":
a) an 'errno' valye that's forced to be one of a specific subset of values,
even if none of them explain what's going on
or
b) an 'errno' value that actually tells you about the error?
Remember - if the *kernel* forces a -EROFS to become a -EIO, then userspace
is stuck with that value.  If the kernel passes -EROFS back to userspace,
then after glibc stashes an EROFS into errno, either glibc or the application
program can insert a 'if (errno == EROFS) {errno = EIO;}' if it feels that
EROFS is unnatural.
And in any case, that's what the *application programmer* needs.  What the *user*
needs is for the file to either be safely stored, or a dialog box put up saying
that it failed....
