Off the top of my head it sounds like you are using the wrong ide i/o
mode.  Your hardware probably supports UDMA66 but you are getting one
of the old PIO modes by default.  What chipset does the Inspiron 7500
use?  (Probably Intel something.  Dell loves Intel.)
A short session with 'hdparm' will confirm or refute this theory.
Andre Hedrick's IDE patch reportedly does a much better job of
supporting and auto-configuring modern chipsets than vanilla 2.2.
