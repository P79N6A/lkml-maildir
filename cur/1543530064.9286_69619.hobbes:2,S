   Well, guess what, then you won't get any error message, unless you were
clever enough to have allocated a string buffer previously. For some types
of programs, a counter for the number of times memory allocation failed is
useful, e.g. syslogd could log a "xx messages lost while memory was
unavailable" when memory allocations start to succeed again.

   No, it's not. It is a fundamental part of programming once you leave the
"Hello World" stage, just as checking the return code from e.g. fopen() is.

   No. Program code has files to back up the address space. You really need
only one page of RAM for all the user space code executing on the system.
