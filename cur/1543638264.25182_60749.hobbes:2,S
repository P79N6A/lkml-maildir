I finally got rid of it ! I now understand why it hanged randomly, and
why I spent lots of time adding/removing unrelated patches. It's because
in apm=power-off mode (SMP), a kernel thread is started for the apm()
function, which does bios calls. And sometimes, the bios is called from
CPU >0, which my bios doesn't like at all, thus explaining why the oopses
were corrupted.
By copying a piece of code somewhere else in the same file, I could force
apm() to be used only by CPU0. I could verify that it doesn't crash anymore,
and that I can also crash it on demand if I force CPU1.
The bonus is that I could re-enable the debug code in this function even
in SMP mode since we're sure that it runs on CPU0.
Here is the patch against 2.4.19-rc5. Marcelo, Alan, please review and apply.
Cheers,
Willy
