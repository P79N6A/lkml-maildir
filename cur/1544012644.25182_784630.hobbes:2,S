1. I send ﻿[PATCH] move arch/x86/pci/pci.h to
arch/x86/include/asm/pci_x86.h but I forget to write x86: before this
patch.
Please let me know which one is better option :
﻿[PATCH]x86: move arch/x86/pci/pci.h to arch/x86/include/asm/pci_x86.h
OR
﻿﻿[PATCH -tip]x86: move arch/x86/pci/pci.h to
arch/x86/include/asm/pci_x86.h
OR some other name.
2. I also did not write any reason of patch this may lead confusion to
other developers, can you please provide some good reasons for this
patch.
3. I also did some cleanups in ﻿arch/x86/include/asm/pci_x86.h raised
by  ./scripts/checkpatch.pl, is this OK.
4. Can I resend above patch by solving above issues.
Thank you,
	JSR
