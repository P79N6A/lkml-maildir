Ahmm, 2.4.3 doesn't work. Gives some IDE DMA timeouts on boot. Kernel was
compiled with Pentium-MMX processor setting, but I don't know if that's
enough to disable the Athlon code parts (autodetected at runtime?).
So only working kernel (without noautotune) on that A7V133 machine is
RedHat's 2.4.2-2 shipped with RedHat 7.1... But that's not good either
because the system has large reiserfs volume and 2.4.2-2 has some reiserfs
bugs.
I really start hating IDE/ATA stuff again.
