d: I think it would not bad if it were included in the resulting
object file like MODULE_AUTHOR is.
If anything, MODULE_AUTHOR could be removed, because the original
author(s) are usually listed at the top of the .c file and not
always the ones to talk to when there is a bug (=> the maintainer
is).
