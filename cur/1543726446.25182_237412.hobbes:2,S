The assumptions there are incorrect - 2.4 is now quite a
different kernel - we haven't seen problems like this on
2.4 at all, and I routinely test that failing code path
in our regression tests every other night on 2.4.  There
have certainly been stack consumers in the 2.6 VFS that
weren't there in 2.4 (like AIO and struct kiocb, etc) so
thats not an apples-to-apples comparison anymore.

I'm not really convinced - the EXPERIMENTAL marking should
be plenty of a deterent to folks in production environments.
There are reports of stack overruns on other filesystems as
well with 4KSTACKS, so doesn't seem worthwhile to me to do
this just for XFS.
cheers.
