Subject: what will connect the fork() with its following code ? a simple example below:
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

if(!(pid=fork())){
     ......
     printk("in child process");
     ......
}else{
     .....
     printk("in father process"); 
     .....
}
this is a classical example, when the fork() system call runs, it will
build a new process and active it . while the schedule() select the
new process it will run. this is rather normal.
but there is always a confusion in my minds. 
because , sys_fork() only copies father process and configure some new
values., and do nothing . so the bridge  between the new process and
its following code, printk("in child process"), seems disappear . so I
always believe that the new process should have a pointer which point
the code "printk("in child process");". except this , there are not
any connection between them ?
very confused :( 
any help will  appreciate  !
