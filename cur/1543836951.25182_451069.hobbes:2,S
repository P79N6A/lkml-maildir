Yes, Linus was wrong here. Or more precisely, he's right original code
is broken, but his suggested "fix" is worse than the original.
	unsigned long timeout = jiffies + HZ/2;
	for (;;) {
		if (ready())
			return 0;
[IMAGINE HALF A SECOND DELAY HERE]	
		if (time_after(timeout, jiffies))
			break;
		msleep(10);
	}
Oops.

But you have to make sure YOU CHECK READY AFTER THE TIMEOUT. Linus'
code does not do that.
