Subject: [PATCH 40/61] SCTP: Always linearise packet on input

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
I was looking at a RHEL5 bug report involving Xen and SCTP
(
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=212550
).
It turns out that SCTP wasn't written to handle skb fragments at
all.  The absence of any calls to skb_may_pull is testament to
that.
It just so happens that Xen creates fragmented packets more often
than other scenarios (header & data split when going from domU to
dom0).  That's what caused this bug to show up.
Until someone has the time sits down and audits the entire net/sctp
directory, here is a conservative and safe solution that simply
linearises all packets on input.
