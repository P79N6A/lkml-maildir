     Nope, I got a stock 2.2.12 distribution which kept doing the spin_lock
thing, applied a patch from David Miller that changed the sparc assembly code
slightly (added a few nop's), with that patch neither machine did the spin_lock
thing again, but after a few hours it would eat up all the memory and die.
     Then I tried applying Andrea's patch since I also had that applied to
2.2.10 (schedualer patch).  Same behavior (except the machine was quicker and
CPU load less).

     The buffers that vmstat reports:
 procs                  memory    swap        io    system         cpu
 r b w  swpd  free  buff cache  si  so   bi   bo   in   cs  us  sy  id
 0 0 0     0 130664 155928 56940   0   0   55    1  179  101   2   5  93
		    ^^^^^^
     That number..  With 2.2.10, that value would start out high but as people
retrieved web pages and the cache grew, first free mem would shrink, but then
when free mem got down to a certain value, buff would start to shrink, and
eventually some sort of equalibrium would be reached between buff and cache
with free mem hanging around that minimal value. 
     But with 2.2.12, free mem just keeps decreasing, then swapd starts to
increase, eventually it gets to a point where anything you try to do says
"killed" and all you can do is reboot and start over.
