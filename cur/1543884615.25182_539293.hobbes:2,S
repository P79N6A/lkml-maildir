OK, whatever you think will work.  But I do think it should be a proper
ELF file with a correct magic number, so that you can just point an ELF
file parser at it and have it work (which means, of course, that all the
file offsets are offsets from the start of the Ehdr, rather than from
the start of the bzImage).
You haven't specifically commented on using the Phdrs as a way of
specifying the mappings required for decompression and early kernel
execution.  It seems pretty natural to me, but I guess that raises the
general question of what execution environment the kernel can expect to
find itself in, and which modes of booting will actually enable paging
and establish any kinds of mapping at all.
In the Xen case, its obviously the domain builder who creates the
mappings, and we can easily implement p != v mappings.  But when booting
native, presumably paging is off at this stage, and only identity maps
can be implemented.  I guess the rough rule is that if paging is enabled
on entry, the kernel should expect all the bzImage mappings to be in
place, but if paging is off, well, the question is moot.
