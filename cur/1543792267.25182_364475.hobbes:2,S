Isn't it true that most of the times we'll need to be worrying about
run-time allocation of memory (using malloc or such) as compared to
static.

We'll need a similar flag for even code pages to start using hugetlb
pages. In this case to keep the kernel changes to minimum, RTLD will
need to modified.

COW, swap etc. are all very nice (little!) features that make hugetlb to
get used more transparently.
