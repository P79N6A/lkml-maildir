We actually have quite heavy synchronization in read*/write* on PPC,
and mmiowb can safely be a no-op.  It would be nice to be able to have
lighter-weight synchronization, but I'm sure we would see lots of
subtle driver bugs cropping up if we did.  write* do a full memory
barrier (sync) after the store, and read* explicitly wait for the data
to come back before.
If you ask me, the need for mmiowb on some platforms merely shows that
those platforms' implementations of spinlocks and read*/write* are
buggy...
