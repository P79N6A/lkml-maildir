ahh ... the value already was set ... ok ... that means that this value is
not the right one for this cpu. i got some new informations which say that
you need different values for different cpus ... at the moment i wait
for an answer from amd. i send them an email and asked for some support on
this toppic. maybe i get the table withe the right settings.
until then i see no way to get further ... so we must wait what their
answer is ...

yes ... of cause ... as you see above, the value it founds was already the
value i thought the patch has to programm. so there could be no difference
in the behavoir. maybe you could do some additional testing ?
could you please change some setting for the pci latency timer in bios or
so ? there were some discussions whether the skippy behavior has something
to do with dma transfers and maybe the latency setting could have
something to do with this. the problem is, that i have no possibility to
test this, cause my system has no problems at all with the patch ...

i think the bios has changed some settings ... the new one handels
something different than the old one ... maybe you could send me both bios
files on my emailadress (no cc to lkml) and i will look whether i find
differences ? (haven't done this before, but maybe i find something)
