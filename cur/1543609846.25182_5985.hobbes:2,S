I changed BLOCK_SIZE back in the 2.4.0-test8 to 512 and had to do some 
modifications to drivers/ide, drivers/scsi, fs/partitions and to fs/ext2 to 
get it to work (patch is 10kiB so not too bad but it doesn't deal with the 
MD driver nor with any of the devices/fs I don't actually use). It then 
worked nicely for me. (Only minor problem with floppy disk resulting in a 
block size error from ll_rw_block but it always went ahead and worked after 
outputting the error.)
And yes, the fixes needed are mostly because of assumptions about 
BLOCK_SIZE being 1024 bytes... If anyone is interested in having a look, 
the now outdated patch is available on the web:
