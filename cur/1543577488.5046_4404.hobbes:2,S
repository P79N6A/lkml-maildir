 have been fixed.
Adding to Rik's items, other things I spot at that "old" list
having changed over last 6 weeks, or so:
o Various Alpha's don't boot under 2.4.0-test9 (PCI-PCI bridge init issues)
o Alpha SMP problem: RSN reuse
	I assume that latter is typo and in reality ASN reuse.
	Fixes got merged during the preprelease-diffs
o Restore O_SYNC functionality ...
o Forwawrd port 2.2 fixes to allow 2 GHz or faster CPU's. {CRITICAL} 
	Also folded in during prerelease-diffs
o mtrr.c is broken for machines with >= 4GB of memory (David Wragg has a fix)
	Merged in at test12 or test13, I think.
o devfs and NFS problems
	fixes are also aplenty over last 6 weeks.
