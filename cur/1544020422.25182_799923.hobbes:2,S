At least with 2.6.28, you could trigger the Oops as follows:
1. Boot with intel_iommu=off
2. Call the exported symbol intel_iommu_domain_alloc() from a module which knows nothing about the fact that dmar_disabled is true
Looks like intel_iommu_domain_alloc is not exported any more at git head, and I see a bunch of commits to git head from Joerg Roedel on Jan 3, 2009, that happened sometime between 2.6.28 and 2.6.29-rc1, so I guess we're good.
Thanks
