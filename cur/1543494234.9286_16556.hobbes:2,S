You are thinking of only one case.  Yes, if you only mount/umount
floppies, this makes sense.  But what if you use a different access
method, such as mtools?  Each time the mtools programs are run, they
need to re-access the same information on the disk, to examine the FAT
tables, directories, etc.  Caching this information is a big win.  But
the block device is opened/closed on every run of the program, so
relying on the change-line to invalidate the buffers makes sense.
