Yes, certainly the st and ipr cases seem different, and originally
I was thinking it was only an issue in connection with get_user_pages.

I don't follow you there, but better if I try to explain how I see it.

It's not fully defined what it does (intentionally: internal detail).
But as I understand it, what it's likely to do is coalesce entries as
far as it can (causes no problem in itself) then shift down and attempt
to coalesce the entries above.  It's the shifting down that gives the
problem.
Imagine we start with sglist
struct page *a, length A
struct page *b, length B
struct page *c, length C
and pci_map_sg finds a+A brings it to b (I'm writing loosely, mixing
the page pointers and their corresponding virtual addresses), but b+B
does not match c.  Then it'll coalesce the first two entries, and
shift down the third to second place, turning sglist into
struct page *a, length A+B
struct page *c, length C
struct page *c, length C
So (again writing loosely, mixing up lengths and orders) on return the
caller will __free_pages(a, A+B) (itself probably wrong since a and b
were likely not buddies to start out with), __free_pages(c, C),
__free_pages(c, C) - doubly freeing c, ensuing mayhem.
Maybe it doesn't change length A to A+B, just doing that in dma_length;
but caller is still going to free c twice.
Agree?
