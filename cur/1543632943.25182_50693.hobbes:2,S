Jesus! I think I shouldn't take it because, as Linus mentioned, I might 
not be 100% neutral. Well, I actually made it in any case to be neutral, 
but this time it's different in many ways, especially because I'd have to 
show a neutral attitude towards my own patches, and it would only be one 
person to find it appropriate.
I try to avoid any prejudices concerning anyone, which includes Kai, so 
we'll give it a try.
Regards,
Thunder
