Just my two cents... I would prefer that to be in kernel (it has what, 8
byte overhead), so that /proc/uptime is correct, not just uptime(1) output.
There are other programs that access /proc/uptime as well, so it would be
good to fix it in one place.
I was thinking, could there be a elegant(ish) place in the kernel where one
could drop a dummy call to get_jiffies64 so that it would always be called
at least once a 497 days (I'm not sure wher the 1.3 years value comes from)?
Other than that this seems a good alternative.
