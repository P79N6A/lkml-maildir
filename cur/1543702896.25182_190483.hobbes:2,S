For the users of laptop-mode patch I find this entry in the manual page
of syslog.conf very interesting:
"You may prefix each entry with the minus ‘‘-’’ sign to omit syncing the
file  after every logging.  Note that you might lose information if the
system crashes right behind a write attempt.  Nevertheless  this  might
give you back some performance, especially if you run programs that use
logging in a very verbose manner."
Found that after finding out that it was syslogd who spun up my disk:)
