Hi,
I found quickly booted into a 2.6.19-rc5 kjernel which was lying around here 
and here CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND doesn't make any problems with my scanner...
gunzip /proc/config.gz -c|grep USB|grep -v "#"

Do you want me to try out kernels until I find one rc which breaks or do you 
have an idea what was changed which could lead to the problem I am

Cheers,
