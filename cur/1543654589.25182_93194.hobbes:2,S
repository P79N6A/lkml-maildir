It had locked here before. Right now I'm running 2.4.20-jam0 although
not complete, I didn't apply:
02-revert-fast-pte-2.bz2    ->    since it seems this is a trouble spot
50-ide-10-partial.bz2       ->    because it locked when uncompressing
51-severworks-ide.bz2             mozilla's sources
61-proconfig-0.9.5.bz2      ->    it did not compile, besides I prefer
                                  config.gz I get with other patch
80-bproc-3.2.3.bz2          ->    didn't need that at all on my desktop
81-export-task_nice.bz2     ->    idem
I have also applied acpi-20021126-2.4.20-rc3.diff.gz
So far I've uncompressed mozilla's sources a couple times while
compiling another thing with -j2 and there's been no problem at all.
Also, -aa kernels are the only ones which behave better in vm management
on my system, besides 2.5.x of course.
I'll put the system under some pressure along the day and see if no lock
ups show up.
Anything else you'd like me to try out? Be it io tests or whatever. At
the moment I can say I do not miss preempt-kernel patches nor have I
noticed any slowdown appreciable.
PS This is a UP system, Athlon-XP 1800+ and VIA KT133A based. Both IDE
ATA5 HD connected to VIA's controller and U2W drive connected to Adaptec
2940-U2W. Only 384MB of memory which had led me to believe all my
problems were due to lack of memory, not so I'm seeing with -aa and 2.5
kernels.
