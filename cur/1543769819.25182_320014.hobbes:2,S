I have a problem with X too. It could be the same.
I have a test program which made a loop in RT to mesure the system perturbation.
It works finely in a tty environment.
When I run it in an X environment ( xterm ), I get something like if I click the Enter key.
If I open a new xterm, this is the active window which receive these events.
These events stop when the program stop.
