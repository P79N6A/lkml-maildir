Look closer. The error report is a big bogus, because it points out as
an error the "return" that is _correct_, not the "return" that is buggy.
Their checkers verify that all exists out of a function have the same
characteristics, and they found a case where one exit exists with
interrupts still disabled, while another one exists after having done a
"restore_flags()". 
So it looks like a real bug, it's just that the error is the _earlier_
return value, not the one pointed at.
