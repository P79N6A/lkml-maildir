I think the common interface should be something in the middle - support for
ACLs on individual files if possible. If not implemented then return ENOSYS. This
would allow for a suitable generic "not implemented" message to be printed.
There appears to be some support for a VFS modification. It would allow file systems
to be used with no initial alterations. One filesystem could be modified at a time
to support ACLs. This would simplify implementation and debugging of the user access
functions.

You bet. This would look like another justification for putting it in the
VFS layer anyway. The huge size of the ACL edit function alone - trying to
second-guess the kernel support would be a loosing battle among version numbers
of even one filesystem.
Guess I'll learn more about the VFS layer implementation to see just how
hard it would be...
