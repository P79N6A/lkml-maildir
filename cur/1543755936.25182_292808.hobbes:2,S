Yes, I had a similar problems at work when I  up2date'd the latest GLIBC for 
RHEL 3 late last year.  A colleague in Montreal (I am in UK) sussed what was 
going on.  I will _presume_ you are seeing similar problems with a kernel 
build.
Here is the link that explains it... what to do with many processes 
segfaulting, I don't know.  RHEL support is _very_ good - give them a ring.
