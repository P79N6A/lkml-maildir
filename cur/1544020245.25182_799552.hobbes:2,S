You didn't give me a chance by removing it. ;-)

[Confused] Yes, they are.
And yes, I agreed that the bus master bit shouldn't be cleared for them.  Which
does not necessarily imply that clearing that bit will always lead to problems
in practice.

Yes, but I suspect the device is misbehaving due to some timing issues.
With devices that behave totally correctly the current code doesn't appear to
cause problems.

Well, we never clear them.

Look.  I have only a limited set of data from devices that have been tested.
On the other hand I have some pieces of documentation that are sometimes not
very clear.  I try to use the data and the docs I have to figure out how things
actually work.
That's why the cases like the Parag's one are so important.  They allow me to
verify assumptions.
So no, I don't say "it must work for everybody", but I have to assume
_something_ if I don't know that _for_ _sure_.  I sometimes make wrong
assumptions, which is a consequence of the fact that I can only use a limited
set of data to verify my observations.
And please note, we still don't know for sure why the Parag's box actually
fails.  We have some theories that may or may not be correct, but that's it.

[Confused again] Why are you talking about keeping bridges powered?

Working on many (different) systems is a good indication of what is and what
is not going to work in general.  It obviously doesn't imply correctness,
though.

DMA from suspend_late?  Come on.

Why are you shouting at me?  Did you read my reply to your other message?
How many times do I have to tell you I AGREE THAT I SHOULD NOT TURN OFF THE
BUS MASTER BIT FOR BRIDGES so that you actually get it?

On suspend we have two things to do:
- save the state
- put the device into a low power state
The state_saved flag can be used to see if the driver has saved the state.
What about powering off?  Are we going to assume that if the driver has saved
the state of the device, the core should not put the device into a low power
state?
