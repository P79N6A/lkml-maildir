One of the big problems is that much of the slab data really is more global
(ie dentry, inodes, etc). Some of it is more localized (typically the 
kmalloc style stuff). I can't really generate any data easily, as most
of my NUMA boxes are either small Opterons / midsized PPC64, which have 
a fairly low NUMA factor, or large ia32, which only has kernel mem on 
node 0 ;-(

That'd be my inclination .... but OTOH, we do that for pagecache OK. Dunno, 
I'm torn. Depends if there's locality on the file access or not, I guess.
Is there any *harm* in doing it node local .... perhaps creating a node
mem pressure imbalance (OTOH, there's loads of stuff that does that anyway ;-))
The other thing that needs serious thought is how we balance reclaim pressure.
