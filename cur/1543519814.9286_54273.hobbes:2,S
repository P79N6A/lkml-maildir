(When the APIC code was modified to log errors.)
It might be worth noting that I'm running two SLOT 1 Celeron 300As
(drilled and soldered to work) on an ASUS P2B-DS board, and I can
overclock them both to 463 MHz (103 MHz FSB) with no problems.  I have
never seen an APIC error message ever, and I've been running these at
300, 450, and 463 quite regularly (while compiling X and other things, as
well).  I'm also using a fairly cheap power supply, and I can see the
voltage drop quite easily when the CPUs are not idling.
