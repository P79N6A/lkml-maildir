Interesting. What happens? Hangs?

This was added to keep the new access method to be as compatible
as possible to the old method (which never posts). 
If someone cites the spec that says that it is not allowed I guess
it could be removed.
In the worst case we could add a new pci_read_config_*_relaxed() 
or somesuch.

Reading is the official way to flush.
