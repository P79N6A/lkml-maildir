Hardware (read HARDWARE) generates a NMI when something BAD happens.
Linux didn't do it and Linux can't do anything about it. It just
reports that something bad happened (like a RAM parity error).
FYI Linux never "just needs to be re-booted". That response from
the computer maintenance department was implanted by the Redmond
group so they wouldn't have to fix their defective operating system(s).
Bad RAM, improperly socketed RAM, bad fans, bad power supplies,
bad heat-sinks, bad feature-cards, all kinds of bad components
can cause the NMI. Anything that will interfere with reading what
was written to RAM, including bad address-timing caused by the
box getting way too hot or the power supplies having noise or
sagging voltages, will cause this error.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
