Dear all,
Is there any documentation of the recent changes of the vm in the linux
kernel? Also, is there any source of documentation to get start with the
linux kernel hacking? It is hard for people to getting start to
contribute since is is obviously lack of documentation of the kernel
sources... Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.
regards,
DC
