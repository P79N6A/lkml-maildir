If I get into kconfig hacking again I will try to look into fixing
kconfig so we can have all Kconfig files in one hirachy.
This would gives us useful information such as dependencies on
unknow symbols and the like.
Statistics as you describe could be relevant to find bad
Kconfig design but I see this much more as a check thing
for bad design than something to make it easier to reach
more configs with 100 randconfigs.
Anyway - this is just vapourware until someone starts
to hack on kconfig.
