Hi,
I need 2 consoles for 2 individual serial ports that is registered by 
register_console(). The console for the 1st serial port is registered at 
first. I can see the output from the serial port #1 before the console 
for the 2nd serial port is registered. However, I saw duplicated output 
from serial port #1 again after the console for #2 serial port is 
registered.
The root cause is that there is only one con_start for all consoles. I 
think con_start need to be merged with struct console so that different 
console could have different start?
Thanks,
Gavin
