Subject: sb live (emu10k1) stops working between 2.6.23.1 and 2.6.23.7

Hello,
I have an SB Live Value card which uses the emu10k1 driver.  I use digital
output to an external amplifier.  This has worked fine for many years, up
to and including kernel 2.6.23.1.  Under 2.6.23.7, I have been unable
to get any audio output.  I get the following errors when loading my
asound.state under 2.6.23.7 using `alsactl restore`:
alsactl: set_control:991: warning: name mismatch (IEC958 Playback
Mask/IEC958 Playback Default) for control #222
alsactl: set_control:993: warning: index mismatch (3/0) for control #222
alsactl: set_control:993: warning: index mismatch (0/1) for control #223
alsactl: set_control:993: warning: index mismatch (1/2) for control #224
alsactl: set_control:985: warning: iface mismatch (3/2) for control #225
alsactl: set_control:987: warning: device mismatch (2/0) for control #225
alsactl: set_control:989: warning: subdevice mismatch (0/0) for control
#225
alsactl: set_control:991: warning: name mismatch (IEC958 Playback
Default/SB Live Analog/Digital Output Jack) for control #225
alsactl: set_control:993: warning: index mismatch (2/0) for control #225
alsactl: set_control:995: failed to obtain info for control #225
(Operation not permitted)
I receive no errors when I load my asound.state under 2.6.23.1.
Under 2.6.23.7, I get the message "No digital data" on my external
amplifier, which normally I only see when the computer is powered down or
rebooting.  I do not get that message under 2.6.23.1, even when no audio
is being played.
I've tried copying down my alsamixer settings under 2.6.23.1, and
re-entering them under 2.6.23.7, however I have still been unable to get
any audio output.
Here is the relevant part of my `lspci -v`:
05:0d.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Live! EMU10k1 (rev
08)
        Subsystem: Creative Labs CT4780 SBLive! Value
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 23
        I/O ports at dce0 [size=32]
        Capabilities: [dc] Power Management version 2
Please let me know if you need any more information, and please CC my
