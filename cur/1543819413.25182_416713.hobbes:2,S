Some watchdog devices have the ability to say "I'm about to reboot you,
do you want to do something about it?".  The IPMI watchdog calls this a
pretimeout, but I have seen this concept on at least two other watchdog
devices.  This can be delivered via an NMI or SMI and can be used to
inform the OS ahead of time that it's going to reboot the system.  This
is useful because you can panic, do a coredump, or perform other useful
operations instead of just rebooting.
Do you think this interface belongs in the structure?
