You just killed that process' performance by causing the
return-stack branch prediction buffer to go out of sync.
It might have worked ok on a 486, but P6+ don't like it one bit.
This is also why I'm slightly unhappy about the
s/int $0x80/call <address of sysenter>/ approach, since it leads
to yet another recursion level and risk overflowing the RSB.
