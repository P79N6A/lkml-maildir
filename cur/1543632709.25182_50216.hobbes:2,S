Subject: sys_time() not working on 64-bit processor

I'm currently running on a 64-bit version of Linux on a MIPS processor
(int == 32 bit, long == 64 bit). I noticed that the time() system call did
not work.
Is there any reason why sys_time() (and sys_stime()) in kernel/time.c is
defined with an int pointer?
