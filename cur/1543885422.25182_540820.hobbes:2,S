Which is why I would prefer not to do it.  I think vmap is not really
compatible with the design of the linux page cache.
Although we can't even count on the pages being mapped into low
memory right now and have to call kmap if we want to access them
so things might not be that bad.  Even if it was a multipage kmap
type operation.

But in a filesystem like ext2 except for a zeroing some unused hunks
of the page all that really happens is you setup for DMA straight out
of the page cache.  So this is primarily an issue for meta-data.
