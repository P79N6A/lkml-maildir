Ying-
I'm a little confused here.  It's very hard to compare a UP application
vs. the same app. converted to use threads.  Unless the app. is
structured such that multiple threads can run at the same time then
no, you won't see any improvement by going to SMP, in fact a true
single threaded app. will frequently slow down when run on an SMP
kernel.
Have you watched a CPU meter while your benchmark runs?  Even something
basic like `top' should give you a feel for whether or not your
using all of the CPU's.
