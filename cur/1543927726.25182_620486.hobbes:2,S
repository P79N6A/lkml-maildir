I had to recompile the kernel because I have a monolithic kernel with as
many components as possible compiled in. But after I disabled the whole
USB subsystem, the laptop doesn't reboot anymore after hibernation. Is
that a bug in the usb driver or are users supposed to unload ehci_hcd
each time before hibernation? In the former case, I'd be willing to help
debug.
