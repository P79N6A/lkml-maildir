Not to disagree with the point but more like 8 (1 us at 8 MHz). It's the 
timeout property.

There's also the bit about microseconds being very losely defined pre 
loops_per_jiffy calibration. Per CPU-family init helps somewhat but 
certainly for family 6 (Pentium Pro, II, III -- lots of hardware with ISA 
busses therefore) speeds vary quite a bit still.

Explained here:

However, that's not an argument. Missing locking is a bug, and current outb 
I/O delay use hiding it doesn't change that.
