Subject: [PATCH] adds carta_random32() library routine
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/29/75

Hello,
This is a follow-up patch based on the review for perfmon2. This patch adds
the carta_random32() library routine + carta_random32.h header file.
This is fast, simple, and efficient pseudo number generator algorithm.
We use it in perfmon2 to randomize the sampling periods. In this context,
we do not need any fancy randomizer.
Changelog:
	- add carta_random32() simple and efficient pseudo random number
	  generator routine to generic kernel library
	- add carta_random32.h header file for prototype
