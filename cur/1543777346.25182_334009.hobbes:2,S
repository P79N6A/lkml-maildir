btw we can hide all of this a lot nicer from just about the entire
kernel by reducing the usage of both HZ and jiffies in drivers/non
platform code. That isn't hard; msleep() is a good step forward there
already; the next step is a nicer api for add_timer/mod_timer that is
both relative and in miliseconds; with those 2 the majority of code that
has "knowledge" about this shrinks to near zero. Once we have that the
actual implementation of this in the background matters a whole lot
less.
