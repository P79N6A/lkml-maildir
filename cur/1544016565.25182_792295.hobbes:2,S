Is a patch broken because hardware has limitations? If that were always
true then many of the patches we see in the kernel wouldn't be there.

Nope. It's done in a very similar way to other real time kernels already
out there - really there are only so many ways to do this.

Why? IRQ threads actually make life so much easier - you have a task
context, you can do everything inside that rather than scheduling all
kinds of deferred work (that in RT will be done in another task later),
and so forth.

Level triggered IOAPIC IRQs have quirks, film at 11!
