  Actually, this is nastier than it looks - currently fs, asks
ext3_sb_getblk() for block 'a' and it gets buffer head with b_blocknr == 'b'
instead. So when remounting you'd have to rewrite these buffers with
original block numbers which is not really possible. So I think
remapping will have to be solved differently, like providing buffer
head with correct b_blocknr but taking care when reading data to it and
reading them from elsewhere. Actually, this has to be done anyway
because JBD escapes data in the journal and you have to do unescaping
when reading data...
