Thank you.  Now I'm more confident that the kernel should have a
reasonable default readahead size. The current one is 5+ years old and
should be updated now.

- It will avoid large-file-reads-thrashing-my-desktop problem,
  so most desktop users should like it. But sure there will be counter
  cases when a user want to keep the data cached.
- File servers may hurt from it. Imagine a mp3/png file server. The
  files are large enough to trigger drop-behind, but small (and hot)
  enough to be cached. Also when a new fedora DVD iso is released, it
  may be cached for some days. These are only the obvious cases.
So I opt for it being made tunable, safe, and turned off by default.
