So?  The user still has the source and is free to use that in other
GPLv2 projects, that's the point. The point is not being able to run
it on any specific hardware, the point is having the source with the
same rights to modify it and distribute it.   And no, the right to
modify your copy of the source does not also mean you *have to* be
able to install it on the hardware it was originally designed for - it
only means you have the right to modify it and redistribute it.
