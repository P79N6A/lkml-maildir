Hello,
I know that you have reduced netdev_max_back_log to 8 to reduce the latency. But 
I think that you should know that I had to set it back to 32 to avoid ethernet 
frame losses on a 3GHz P4 using e1000 (eth0/threaded=1).
My app is still the one with a 20Mbytes/s flow of data and some signal 
processing work. That's only 20% of max Gigabit Ethernet load and 40% of CPU 
time. Not really hot stuff.
So, this were my 2 cents to help you decide how to balance latency and 
throughput. I hope that you can find a good balance or find a way to allow 
people to easily choose their own balance (e.g. maybe there should be a list of 
parameters impacting latency in the Documentation directory).
  please keep on the good work and thanks a lot !
	P.O. Gaillard
