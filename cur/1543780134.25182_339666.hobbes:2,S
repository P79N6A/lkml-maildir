I haven't tested it. Someone with a e1000 must see if it works. I
submitted the e100 fix that had the same problem, but I would feel
better if the patch I sent for the e1000 actually got tested.
To test, one would setup a box with the e1000 and netconsole. Run with
something doing several printks (possible using sysrq-t or such), and
then unplug the cable (without Andi's patch) and replug it back in. If
the patch worked, the system would hang while the cable was detached,
but come back shortly after the cable was plugged back in.
