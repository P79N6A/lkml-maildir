ROOT can not do JACK to hurt the system, if you do not compile in the full
option!  Basically everybody is bitching about something they never knew
they could do.  I jsut wait to protect the basic sevice calls to the
kernel and then give you the best way to fuck yourself ever.
So yes without the full taskfile you protect the kernel and hardware alot.
With the full taskfile you can have an orgy!
