Could you mention it in feature-removal-schedule.txt?  (People check that for 
warning of upcoming changes that impact existing code.  They may not notice 
something elsewhere after they've got it working...)
(Also, sorting feature-removal-schedule.txt by date would be really nice.  The 
sucker's gotten huge...)
And while I'm looking at this, is there some other place that entries in this 
file go once they _have_ been removed, so people can see "oh yeah, that went 
away in 2.6.23) when they try to install 2.6.25?  If there is, I missed it.  
Maybe 
http://lwn.net/Articles/2.6-kernel-api/
 is good enough, but this seems 
easy to do in Documentation...
Thanks,
Rob
