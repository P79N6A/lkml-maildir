Im trying to get udev working with 2.6.0 (as a replacement for devfs).
Im following the instructions as I read them, but *nada*.
So, I must be mis-interpreting something...
OK, I made sysfs, actually I added the line
    none       /sysfs      sysfs   defaults        0 0
to /etc/fstab, and did a 'mount -a'.
There is 'stuff' below this node.
I built udev-0.2, and put udev in /sbin/udev
I put /sbin/udev into /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug (replacing /bin/true) with
    echo /sbin/udev > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
doing a cat /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug shows that it is there.
I have then plugged and unplugged a USB device and /udev does not appear.
So I did a 'mkdir /udev'.
Plug and unplug again.
Still nothing.
So, what am I missing???
[[ there are numerous messages in the /var/log/messages for each plug/unplug
of the USB device ]]
