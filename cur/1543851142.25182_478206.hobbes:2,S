Hello,
is preferred to have firmware in kernel binary (and go through array of chars)
or userspace (and load it through standard kernel api)?
For char sx driver in this case (I hope there is no later fw):
ftp://ftp.bitwizard.nl/specialix/sx_firmware_306c.tgz
Now it's 2 .c files used by loader through ioctl. After compilation it has:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
      4    8416       2    8422    20e6 si2_z280.o
      4   19484       2   19490    4c22 si3_t225.o
So convert it to binary (and load it through userspace) or simply #include it in
the sources? I hope the former is preferred?
thanks,
