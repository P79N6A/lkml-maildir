Almost. I think this is only relevant for mmap2(), where we pass a single
pointer to a struct with all six arguments, but the result is the same.
I don't know where I got the misinformation about the register pairs
on s390, but I verified that the problem exists on MIPS and PowerPC.
See sys32_ftruncate64 in arch/mips/kernel/linux32.c and 
arch/ppc64/kernel/sys_ppc32.c. PA-RISC appearantly work around this
by defining their own system call handlers with separate high/low
arguments, so they effectively work like i386 and s390.
