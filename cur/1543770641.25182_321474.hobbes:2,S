Hello all,
I have a an Acecad/Medi@com graphic tablet. There are drivers for it 
available on the Internet (see for examples 
http://acecad.sourceforge.net/
 and the pages linked from there, 
although the wanadoo.fr page at the top is temporarily unavailable), 
but it seems they have not been merged into mainline. Is there a 
particular reason for it?
