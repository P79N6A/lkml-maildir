Adding a member to the ip_conntrack/nf_conntrack and sk_buff struct would
increase the struct sizes, and that would penalize users who do not intend
to use xt_portscan.
I do not see why the packet/connection marks should not be used to record
additional information. After all, that is what users use marks for.
xt_portscan can be precisely configured how to set its marks (mask is
supported), so that it only takes away 4 bits of the 32-bit connection
mark and 1 bit of the 32-bit packet mark.
Almost never I required connection marking myself except for this
portscanning automaton and perhaps a little MARK here and there for
finely-tuned SNAT. Again, things might look different on your side(s).
QoS, while primarily using CLASSIFY, is one point where MARK can be used.
I would assume that those who use xt_portscan should be fine with the
remaining 24 bits.
Thank you,
Jan
