Indeed. That's why I suspect that we want to just walk the list until we
hit the first exclusive one (or the head), when we add a new exclusive
waiter. 
Despite the fact that it's usually easier to just add to the end (make the
wait-queue a doubly linked list). But I think we want to go doubly linked
anyway, and just test things out (and to finally get rid of the horrible
remove_wait_queue() thing).
