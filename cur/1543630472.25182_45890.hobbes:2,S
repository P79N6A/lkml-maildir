Exactly how many system exist which
  a) still use the two or three year old devfs naming scheme for
     their root= command line
  b) use current 2.5 kernels
and
  c) have users not capable of translating that syntax to either
     the new devfs or traditional Linux syntax?
I don't think there are more then about ten, and no I _absolutely_
do not consider that a reason to bloat the kernel, even if it is just
source and image bloat.
