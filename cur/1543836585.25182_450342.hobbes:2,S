Firstly, backwards compatibility is very important; I would guess that 
if there were a Xen4 ABI, the hypervisor would still support Xen3 for 
some time.  Secondly, if someone goes to the effort of backporting a 
Xen4 paravirtops driver for 2.6.18, then you could compile it in.

Conceptually, the paravirtops structure is a structure of pointers to 
functions which get filled in at runtime to support whatever hypervisor 
we're running over.  But it also has the means to patch inline versions 
of the appropriate code sequences for performance-critical operations.
