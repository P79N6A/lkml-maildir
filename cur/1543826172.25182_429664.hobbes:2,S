There's been something wrong with the serial console on the resume front
on my box for quite some time now.  However, I don't use it very often and I
have a patch that disables suspending of the console's serial port, if anyone
is interested (no, I'm not going to post it to the list ;-) ).
I only observed that the serial console works just fine wrt suspend/resume
if I boot with init=/bin/bash.
Greetings,
Rafael
