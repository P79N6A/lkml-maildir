1) You should post sparc patches at least CC:'d to sparclinux@vger.kernel.org
   which is where the Sparc developers hang out.
2) I can't see any reason why this part of your patch can be valid.
   This structure is exported to userspace and therefor is part of
   the user-visible API and thus cannot be changed.
If there is some bug or bogus limitation in the module tools which
limits the number of symbols visible due to the sizing of this
structure, that is what needs to be changed not this structure.
