Well, ever since the mirrors started, I haven't been able to get to
www.kernel.org.  Even during non-peak hours (4am EST).  It just seems
that with the round-robin mirrors, you're playing russian roulette with
what you will find on the mirror-of-the-minute.
Some have only .gz, some only .bz2, some both.  Some only have 2.2, some
have all kernels.  A better thing to do would be to list all the mirrors
directly (but keep the www.xx.kernel.org), so that people can find what
mirror works best for them, instead of getting a random mirror every
time they check for a new kernel.
