FYI...the output I showed previously was on a tainted kernel(vmware 
modules), but after a fresh reboot and on the identical but untainted 
kernel, I got the same error while doing the same thing, namely 
converting a mysql myisam table to innodb. I did succesfully convert 
some tables without a problem, and the table that triggered the problem 
originally did succeed after rebooting.
