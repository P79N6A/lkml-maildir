Damn, I didn't say it clear enough, the / is on an LVM volume.  /Boot is 
on /dev/hda1, aka (hd0,0) in the first line.  Since the msg pointed at 0,0, 
I'll switch that line to "root (sd0,0)" just for grins.
I take it that was an auto-conversion?  I did nothing to confirm any changes 
when I ran a make oldconfig, using the 2.6.22.1-rt3 .config as the src 
config.
Thanks.

But I was there and I saw what you did,
I saw it with my own two eyes.
So you can wipe off that grin;
I know where you've been--
It's all been a pack of lies!
