/sbin/iptables and /sbin/route are merely configuration interfaces to the 
kernel proper, not really familiar with netstat - but as far as I know all 
it does is dumps kernel runtime configuration and statistics.  That's 3 
utilities which are no way apps - just interfaces.  Now dhcpd is an app 
and zebra is an app - but they are still mainly kernel oriented.  The 
first 3 depend only on kernel speed and the next 2 depend mostly on kernel 
speed.  I'd say you just proved how important kernel optimilization is for 
routers.
Cheers,
