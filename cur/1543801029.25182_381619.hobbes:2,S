This looks similar to my output except that the page flags are 
0x060000000000006c in your case whereas I have 0x010000000000006c.
I have run amanda with a patch modified so that it prints results for 32 
consecutive writes each 10000 writes (if ((ctr++ % 10000) < 32)). This 
showed that taper (at least in my case) is actually using a buffer of 20 x 
32 kB = 640 kB. In all writes the mapping, counts, and flags were the 
same. Instead of remapping a single 32 kB buffer, st is cyclically mapping 
20 32 kB buffers.

The mapping and flags have changed. The flags have lost one bit at the 
high end and the PG_lru and PG_active flags.
The patch sets the page pointer to NULL after page_cache_release() is 
called in st. This means that st is not calling page_cache_release() more 
than once for each page returned by get_user_pages(). The page state 
seems to get corrupted somewhere.
I have to continue thinking.
