Yes, I was at last about to reply on that point and others.
I'll make those comments in a separate mail to Nick and all.

Attractive, I very much wanted to do that rather than change all the
arches, but I think s390 rules it out: its pte_mkdirty does nothing,
its pte_dirty just says no.
Whether your patch suits all other uses of (__)follow_page I've not
investigated (and I don't see how you can go without the set_page_dirty
if it was necessary before); but at present see no alternative to
something like Nick's patch, though I'd much prefer smaller.
Or should we change s390 to set a flag in the pte just for this purpose?
