Having a single drive on the channel configured as slave is not really a 
legal configuration. (I believe the ATA standards say that it's 
something that a host controller/driver/OS is allowed to support, but it 
is not required to.) A single drive should always be set to master (and 
connected to the end of the cable and not the middle, by the way).
