Because the hal-driven whitelist allows us to match systems in a more detailed
way.  If your system is in the s2ram whitelist already and works with it, there
shouldn't be any difference.
Still, I was only considering that as a debugging aid in your case, because
s2ram works in the minimal configuration, while hald doesn't.
