Phew, at least we agree on something.  In fact I _think_ we were maybe
talking at cross-purposes and not disagreeing about anything that
actually mattered :-)

Hmm, OK. So the queue will potentially fill up with requests for both
hda and hdb.  The request_fn for this queue will get called, sometimes
by the block layer, sometimes not, and can handle all/some/none of the
requests at each call.  If it decides to handle (say) one of the
requests by initiating DMA and then returns while bytes are
transferring, then let's think what happens next time it gets called... 
If it's called as a result of the DMA-complete interrupt, then no
worries because the DMAing is finished.  If it's called instead by the
block-layer because another request has been added, it needs to know
that it shouldn't do anything until the DMAing finishes.  It could find
that out by looking at a channel->busy flag.  If it doesn't use a busy
flag, then what provides the locking?
I'm slowly growing more sure that I've missed the point.  But please
point to the mistake in the above logic to help me learn...

Agreed.  And in the case of a cmd640 (etc.), the queue should handle
both channels.
cheers
