That will:
- cause you to always have a program mlock()ed in memory,
  taking up more space than a simple kernel subroutine
- result in an OOM killer which has less information available
  than an in-kernel OOM killing routine (how are you going to
  read stuff from /proc when you're OOM?)
- still not give you the "pop-up window" since you haven't
  reserved memory for the X server and window manager to be
  able to display that window in the first place ;)

This is a completely separate issue, but a really neat
idea. However, this is not something that will be able
to run when the system has no more memory left ;)

You have some very nice ideas, but none of them will be
able to run when the system is out of memory. Maybe you
want to take the "we're out of memory" constraint into
consideration when designing an OOM handler...
