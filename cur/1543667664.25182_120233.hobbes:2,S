Hi
I am interested in this, but I only have LKML at work.  Mind
sending me all the changes to 2.5.66 as one bulk patch?
Also, I did some initial patch to get w83781d support in, but
it very rough.  I will try to get to doing it according to your
'How to convert i2c adapter drivers into good kernel code' ...
Who do I sent it to if completed ?
Thanks,
