Ah, ok, and load the legacy_serial module. Going from built-in serial to
modules I was already challenged to find serial_core, 8250, 8250_pnp
and/or 8250_pci (the help in "make menuconfig" does not seem to show the
help that is written in the Kconfig file for 8250_pnp and 8250_pci).

What about 2.6.22.x? Or should the distro kernels use that revert patch
for their stable 2.6.22 kernels?
