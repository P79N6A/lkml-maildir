Subject: Support for TI FlashMedia (pci id 104c:8033, 104c:803b) flash card readers

I would like to announce the availability of the
driver for TI FlashMedia flash card readers. Currently
supported pci ids:
1. 104c:8033.3
2. 104c:803b.2
Device with id 8033 also features sdhci interface (as
subfunction 4). However, sdhci is disabled on many
laptops (notably Acer's), while FlashMedia interface
is available.
The driver is called tifmxx and available from:
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/tifmxx/
Only mmc/sd cards are supported at present, via mmc
subsystem. Provisions for other card types (Sony MS,
xD and such) are in place, but no support is available
due to lack of hardware and interest.
