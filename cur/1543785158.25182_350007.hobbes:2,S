Thanks, interesting.
And hey, 13 compilations may sound like a lot, but considering that there
were 2069 commits between 2.6.12 and 2.6.13-rc1, having to do "just" 13
kernels to pinpoint the exact cause is pretty good, I think.
Especially as I don't think anybody would really have expected the one you 
found:

Interesting, and a bit scary. If it worked with 1kHz (old default value),
it's not even any of the old Linux x86 timeouts (that were designed for
100 Hz), so it's some _new_ HZ dependency.

Yes, that would be interesting.
Btw, what's the exact error message you get? (And is it the kernel or the
burning app that complains?)
