yes, but you said "minor fault", not "vmalloc fault".
minor faults are the things that happen when a task does read-after-COW 
or read-mmap-ed-pagecache-page, and they very much go through 
__handle_mm_fault().
vmalloc faults are extremely rare, x86-specific and they are a pure 
kernel-internal matter. (I'd never want to trace them, especially if it 
pushes tracepoints into every architecture's page fault handler. I 
implemented the initial version of them IIRC, but my memory fails 
precisely why. I think it was 4:4 related, but i'm unsure.)
(i now realize that above you said "in-kernel minor faults" - under that 
you meant vmalloc faults?)
