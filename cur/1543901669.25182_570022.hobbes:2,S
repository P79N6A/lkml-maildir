Why the module parameter?  Is there any reason a user would want to
turn this off?  Or conversely, why is it off by default?
Also this patch seems to depend heavily on the multiple EQ patch,
which I am holding off on now.  So you may want to rebase to my
current tree, which has all the ehca patches except the EQ one.

Although trivial, this chunk doesn't really belong in this patch --
just fix it up in the multiple EQ patch (which I haven't merged yet).
