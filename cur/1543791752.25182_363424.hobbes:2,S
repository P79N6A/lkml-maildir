You can't do anything useful with some systems without disabling the HPA
because it is used to mask most of the drive at boot to hide from old
incompatible BIOS.
IRQ mask is on my todo list and looks quite easy. A small number of
controllers mishandle the case when the FIFO empties. Instead of
stalling the drive they dribble random numbers.
