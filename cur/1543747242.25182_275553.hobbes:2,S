The IT8212 driver depends on other -ac IDE changes. There was an earlier
version that didn't but that has some other bugs and since Bartlomiej
rejected it I've no interest in maintaining that version.
I'm afraid you'll need the -ac patches to use the IT8212. That isn't how
I wanted it either. Once 2.6.10 is out I'll maybe do a 2.6.10-ac. Right
now however both the released 10rc trees crashed or hung on boot on my
test boxes and I've not got the time to mess with random -bk snapshots.
