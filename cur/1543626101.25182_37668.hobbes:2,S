I know that this is boring and a number of my earlier reports was
apparently ignored but a tulip driver "0.9.15-pre10 (Mar 8, 2002)"
as used in 2.4.19-pre4 still does not really work.  I know that it is
fine with various clones like "Davicom" and "Lite-On PNIC", for example,
but with a real tulip from DEC, PCI id 1011:0019, not a single ethernet
packet is getting through.
Luckily 'de4x5' allows me to use a network but maybe this "tulip" driver
should be renamed onto "anything-but-tulip"?
