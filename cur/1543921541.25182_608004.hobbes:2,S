Ubuntu kernel 2.6.22-10 works fine - I get sound although volume
control doesn't seem to work.
With 2.6.23 (today's git actually) I get this error on loading snd-hda-intel -
[  672.830052] PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1b.0 to 64
[  673.061586] hda_codec: STAC922x, Apple subsys_id=106b0800
[  673.471059] ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:1b.0 disabled
[  673.471367] HDA Intel: probe of 0000:00:1b.0 failed with error -16
Any ideas?
Thanks
Parag
