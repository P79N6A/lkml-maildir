Hi there,
Newcomer to the List. I have an S3-Trio 64V+ Card. In the configuration of the
kernel, the framebuffer thing for S3 trio is disabled. But, while exploring the
sources I saw that there is the file related to framebuffer in S3 Trio.
How do I enabled it so that I can use the framebuffer for S3 and 
one more question is that why cannot it be enabled from 'make xconfig'???
Any particular reason why ??
Regards
Sorry forgot the kernel. The Kernel Version I am using is 2.2.12
