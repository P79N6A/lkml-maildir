Hmm. I was talking about real stuff, not some theory.....

# vmstat -a
usage: vmstat [-V] [-n] [delay [count]]
              -V prints version.
              -n causes the headers not to be reprinted regularly.
              delay is the delay between updates in seconds.
              count is the number of updates.
