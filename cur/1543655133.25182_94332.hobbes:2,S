  	timer_exit() isn't a public function, and doesn't even exist in 2.5.
  	2.4 calls it internally after timers. It seems timer users need not
  	do anything special.

       Another common problem is deleting timers which restart
       themselves (by calling <function>add_timer()</function> at the end 
       of their timer function).  Because this is a fairly common case 
-      which is prone to races, you can put a call to
-      <function>timer_exit()</function> at the very end of your timer function,
-      and user <function>del_timer_sync()</function> 
-      (<filename class=headerfile>include/linux/timer.h</filename>)
+      which is prone to races, you should use <function>del_timer_sync()</function> 
+      (<filename class=headerfile>include/linux/timer.h</filename>) 
       to handle this case.  It returns the number of times the timer 
       had to be deleted before we finally stopped it from adding itself back 
       in.
