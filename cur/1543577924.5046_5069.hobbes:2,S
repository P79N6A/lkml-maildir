Its based on the docs I have + a test program for the non LFS/limit cases that
sct provided. -ac4 isnt quite compliant (sends SIGXFZ on a short write case
which is wrong and also doesnt do a write partiall overlapping the disk limit)
-ac5 should fix those

You don't need to add the callback. Set the limit infinite and handle it in your
truncate and writing paths.
