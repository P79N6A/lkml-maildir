Hmm, I wonder if this is also affecting Mark's problem.
But since I showed that if hardirqs_disabled and running PREEMPT not
PREEMPT_RT, disable_irq can call schedule.  This is done in
drivers/net/3c59x.c.  It has a watchdog timeout calling disable_irq, which
calls synchronize_irq which might schedule:
void synchronize_irq(unsigned int irq)
{
	struct irq_desc *desc = irq_desc + irq;
	if (irq >= NR_IRQS)
		return;
	if (hardirq_preemption && !(desc->status & IRQ_NODELAY))
		wait_event(desc->wait_for_handler,
			!(desc->status & IRQ_INPROGRESS));
	else
		while (desc->status & IRQ_INPROGRESS)
			cpu_relax();
}
