I don't think it will either.  I was attempting it since it looks like the 
keyboard works at the lilo prompt so I guess it's jumping to legacy PS/2 
support.
: The OS should either be built with USB keyboard support so
: that when the USB host controller driver disables legacy

: should be built with _NO_ USB support, so that the BIOS

: keyboard & mouse.
Okay, I'm pretty sure the standard boot kernel doesn't have USB support at
all since it's never detected it on any other systems.
