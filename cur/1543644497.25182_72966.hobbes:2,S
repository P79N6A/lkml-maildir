No, it is not write posting.  It is usually a problem with write
combining/merging and or read prefetch on devices that do not
support this feature.  The memory BAR on the aic7xxx chips does
not have the PREFETCH bit set so these types of operations are
forbidden by the spec.  The end result are missed writes and
state read data leading to all kinds of driver confusion.
Often these issues are really register layout dependent.  If
you never have to access two registers that are right next to
each other, the chipset can't write combine, etc.
