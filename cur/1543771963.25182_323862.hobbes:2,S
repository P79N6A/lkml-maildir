This makes me seriously to despair.... the bug/lock/freeze is still there in 2.6.12rc6 ...
I am seriously offering 1000 dollars to the one who fixes this. (No Joke. I NEED that fixed. If you 
want me to give that money to some organization, tell me.)
Please come back to me if you need more details or tell me what I can do to help you track this 
down. Review all postings before please. Its a vm-lock because even opening a /proc file needs 
around 20-30 seconds...
