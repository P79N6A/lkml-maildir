   Grumble... and I suppose a failed execve() needs to return an error
   to that one thread, but a succesful one needs to atomically destroy all
   the other threads...  And HOW is this supposed to be implemented?
Well, that isn't explicitly demanded by the standard, but I don't
thing any other behaviour would make much sense.
   The previous version of the standard had this right - just leave it
   undefined and let the OS try to do something sane.  Hopefully this part
   will get nixed before the final revision.
Are you sure?  I don't have a copy of ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (the
official designation of the 1996 edition which includes threads
(1003.1c-1995)), but there is nothing in the draft that indicates that
this is a new requirement.  And it won't be "nixed" if none of the
kernel people object to it.  The requirement makes sense to me, from a
user standpoint.
