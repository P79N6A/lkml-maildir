I believe it has somethin to do with RH scripts.  I just upgraded to 7.2 
and I got
the same crap.  I have the 3c982.  It didn't seem to affect much besides 
not loading
my eth0 correctly, but I just fixed that with ifconfig.

List,
I am having a problem with a 3c905C and later kernels (2.4.9, 2.4.12 and
2.4.13).  When I try to use my 3c905C with these kernels I get this error
message:
Cannot open netlink socket: Address family not supported by protocol
Kernel 2.4.7 works fine with this nic tho. I also tried this on another
machine with the same results.
Any suggestions?
thank you,
