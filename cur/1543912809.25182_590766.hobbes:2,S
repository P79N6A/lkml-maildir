When companies have taken our wireless device drivers, many many of
them have given changes and fixes back.  Some maybe didn't, but that
is OK.
When Linux took our changes back, they immediately locked the door
against changes moving back, by putting a GPL license on guard.
Why does our brother Linux take a file that is 90% BSD licensed,
and refuse to let us see the 10% he adds?
