   what's the status of SATA support in 2.4.x kernels?
   it seems like the first kernel that supports SATA is 2.4.21-ac4. I 
found few messages on lkml but not much more info about status of 
development.
   I am specifically interested whether it should support disks above 
137GB (as I have problems accessing anything above 137GB on 250GB SATA 
drive)
   any info/answers/pointers to docs?
   (I already posted a message here about 137GB & SATA but got no 
answers so I am trying somewhat different question)
   TIA
