I think we'd be better off checking for this case by requiring the
firmware to include a length field and adapting the binary interface
so that we can see the open/close boundary.  The "loading" thing is
pretty damn ugly.
Plus with the "loading" file, a interrupted load will just appear to
be unterminated - and if the scripts run again they'll have to check
that the loading file was 0 to start with - and if it isn't there's
nothing they can do except wait for the dead load to time out.
Better to catch the close, check the length, then return the firmware
or throw the junk image away as appropriate.
