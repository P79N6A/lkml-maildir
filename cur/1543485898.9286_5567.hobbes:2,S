It is possible, and it works very well.  Bind your sockets, and put
their fd's in the read set for select().

Because of the problem of stealing ports.  With SO_REUSEADDR, *if* you
do allow someone to bind to INADDR_ANY and someone else to bind to the
specific address, then the only reasonable thing to do is stop feeding
the specific address' packets to the first.  This is no matter how many
interfaces you have.
So there are two choices here that make sense:
1) the old one, where this is allowed.  a new app can "steal" the
   connections from another one, if it bound to INADDR_ANY.
2) the new one, where this won't work.  if INADDR_ANY is taken, you
   can't bind again.
The change was made on the grounds that option #1 is unintuitive and can
easily lead to security holes.  It's just annoying to have to find all
interfaces and bind to them, for every service that runs on a port >1024.
IMHO, there *are* situations where the laxer approach would work better;
sometimes you do trust your users (i.e it's not a public machine with
lots of shell accounts), and you might want have a default server for a
service, and more specific ones for some interfaces.  
So I'd say it's reasonable to add a global flag somewhere in /proc or
sysctl, to toggle these (with the current, more secure behavior as the
default).
(note that, if that idea doesn't catch on with the networking gurus,
nothing prevents you from doing it yourself on your server; it's
probably a very simple patch).

I don't think Solaris/sparc allows it, but it's been long since I played
with overlapping bind()s, so I could be mistaken.  AFAIR, overlapping
IPs is more of a BSD-ism than a recognized standard Unix feature.

It's not that rare; just about every user-level server out there would
be affected.  On some systems, nfsd itself could be affected, leading to
a trivial exploit if some other machine mounts your directories.

Looks like a bad kludge to me.  Network objects and uid's have never had
any kind of tight coupling or relationship on Unix.
If we did go that way, I'd rather have an explicit option that the
INADDR_ANY server must use, i.e something like setsockopt( ... ,
SO_IPOVERLAP, &one);
