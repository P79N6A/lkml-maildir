<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Ok, that subject has probably gotten this message 
deleted without being read, but if you've gotten this far...</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I've been trying to use my USB mouse in Linux for 
the last few stable kernels without luck. I'm currently running 2.2.12 on a dual 
PII/350, 440BX system. I enabled CONFIG_USB??? and built the usb-uhci module. I 
can modprobe it and it detects my mouse (according to SIGUSR1 on uhci-control), 
but I can't get any data from reading /dev/usbmouse (c 10 32). I also can't open 
the mouse until I kill -USR1 uhci-control. The interrupt service registers 
itself in /proc/interrupts (IO-APIC-edge, irq11), but the interrupt counters 
never increment.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>This is what I've tried:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I moved uhci_check_configuration above 
interruptible_sleep_on in uhci_control_thread. This seemed to fix the problem of 
not being able to open /dev/usbmouse until I'd killed -USR1 
uhci-control.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I stuck printks at the tops of a&nbsp;lot of 
functions. What I noticed is uhci_interrupt is never called. At least, I never 
see the printk. Can you printk inside of an interrupt handler?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I think maybe ???_ticktd is failing? The function 
gets called, and says it is supposed to cause an interrupt per second on the USB 
device, but I never see any interrupts happen.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Any ideas? I realise USB isn't supported in 2.2, 
but I don't really want to go to 2.3 just yet... anyone have any ideas what's 
wrong in the 2.2 code?</FONT></DIV>
