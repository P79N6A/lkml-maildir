Suspend-to-disk. suspend-to-ram still doesn't work for me (never has, oh,
well.. Slow progress).

No.
If we do this, then we don't need the translation at all. And I guarantee
you that drivers _will_ be broken - I had this in my tree earlier by
virtue of "no translation". I mentioned the tg3 driver already, and I
assume others will too.
I repeat: we can remove the hack if somebody checks the drivers.
