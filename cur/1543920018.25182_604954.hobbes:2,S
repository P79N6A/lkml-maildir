I build linux-2.6.23-mm1 and try to boot it using qemu,
and it crashed with trace like this:
do_page_fault
error_code
lock_acquire
_spin_lock_irqsave
gdth_timeout
run_timer_softirq
__do_softirq
do_softirq
I have screenshot, but have no idea, is it legal to include it, if I
sent copy to lkml.
config of kernel in attachment,
I apply all three patches from hot-fixes.
