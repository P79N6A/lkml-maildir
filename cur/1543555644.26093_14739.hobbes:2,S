Subject: iBCS2 and 2.4.0-11 Can we make soup yet?

I noticed that iBC2 support no longer builds against 2.4.0-11.  I also
found that 11/98 seems to be the last version of iBCS2 posted.  2.4.0-11
does have a MISC binary loadable option, but I did not see iBCS2 in the
tree.  Is there something more recent, or is iBCS2 something that's
basically no longer considered critical for Linux?
Thanks
Jeff
