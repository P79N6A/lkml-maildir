Not static data, no. But think about putting some dynamic data there.  
Like, say, some version of user-space readable jiffies. There are some  
applications that would benefit from having access to those without  
syscall overhead. There may be some other similar stuff, too.
As for jiffies, under good ol' DOS, one thing I've done fairly often was  
to use the BIOS ticker value to decide if I should refresh some cached  
values, like, say, my idea of system time (usually by the rule "no more  
than once per tick"), or user feedback, so as to not spend too much time  
doing that. There doesn't seem to be a good equivalent for Linux  
currently.
