I'd rather verify_port didn't get used for that - it's purpose is to
validate changes the admin makes to the port.
I don't know why you think that setting 9bit mode should be done this
way rather than through the usual termios methods - the termios methods
already have a way to control the length of each character, so it would
seem logical to put the control in there.
