'normal' systems are irrelevant here. This message is triggerable remotely.
Even though it's ratelimited, anyone can flood another boxes logs by
sending enough packets.
The message is also utterly useless. What kind of action would you take
to a few gigabytes of "ipt_hook: happy cracking.\n" ?
There's no IP address logged, or any other useful information.
