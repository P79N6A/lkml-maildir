This build failure is seen on the powerpc from the 2.6.24-git18 kernel and is still visible
in the 2.6.25-rc1-git1.
drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c:44: error: __param_proto causes a section type conflict

The patch 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/8/514
 seems to have not taken into 2.6.25-rc1 and 
2.6.25-rc1-git(s). Is there any new patch i am missing out.
