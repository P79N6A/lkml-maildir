My plan was to make sysfs more independent from struct device/kobject.
e.g. Something like the following.
* kobject_get() on attr/symlink creation
* open() doesn't need extra kobject reference
* deleting a node makes it release the kobject reference and the kobject
pointer is nullified.
This way the sysfs reference counting can be put completely out of
picture without impacting the rest of code.  Handling symlink and
suicidal attributes might need some extra attention but I think they can
be done.
In the long term, I think sysfs should be independent from driver model
and kobject such that an entity which wants to use sysfs but is not a
device doesn't have to dance with kobject just to use sysfs.
Thanks.
