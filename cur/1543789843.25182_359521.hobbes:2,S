that's the old school 1970's stuff
the "heap" is still brk in linux, however there is no 1:1 relation
between heap and malloc. malloc in glibc is implemented both using brk
and mmap, depending on the size of your allocation.

you need to mmap these yourself to be sure.. eg you cannot mprotect the
output of malloc, at least not reliably. Only of mmap.

no it has sideeffects; eg it most likely affects more memory than just
your malloc()'d part

see definition of heap vs malloc above
