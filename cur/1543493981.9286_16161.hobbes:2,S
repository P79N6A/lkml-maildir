Actually, Coherent (Mark Williams Co.) went under about the time of
1.2.13 when Linux started exploding in popularity.  I think it was about
the time RedHat 3.0.3 came out.  It couldn't compete with the price and
source availability.  I still have my disks and manuals from 4.0 (I
believe it was the last version issued).  The manual was quite good; it
included some nice documentation of system commands and utilities such
as awk, sed, etc.
