Yes (I hadn't noticed it) but it was not connected to any server and
disabling it doesn't change the results.

Sure, I aim at porting the high resolution timers but any annoying bug
related to the time can be interesting to remove.
Coincidently Vita has just reported a bug on the lkml which, after a
closer look, seems to be the same:

From what I understand their is a bug in the timers that causes a big
granularity. The case of Vita is a very good example. Also, after 16s it
seems the granuality (slowly?!) jumps from 1/64th s to 16s! :
sleep requested	 time obtained
14.000000000     14.006201744
15.000000000     15.006647110
16.000000000     16.007089615
17.000000000     18.742679596
18.000000000     32.014190674
19.000000000     32.014190674
20.000000000     32.014190674
I think lines like that from patch-2.5.64 are very suspicious to be
related to the bug:
+	base->timer_jiffies = INITIAL_JIFFIES;
+	base->tv1.index = INITIAL_JIFFIES & TVR_MASK;
+	base->tv2.index = (INITIAL_JIFFIES >> TVR_BITS) & TVN_MASK;
+	base->tv3.index = (INITIAL_JIFFIES >> (TVR_BITS+TVN_BITS)) & TVN_MASK;
+	base->tv4.index = (INITIAL_JIFFIES >> (TVR_BITS+2*TVN_BITS)) &
TVN_MASK;
+	base->tv5.index = (INITIAL_JIFFIES >> (TVR_BITS+3*TVN_BITS)) &
TVN_MASK;
Any idea/sugestion/patch is welcomed. Whatever, I will try to fix this
as soon as I'm back from my week end :-)
