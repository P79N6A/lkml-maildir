Hi Dominik,
I noticed that Linus committed the patch from you that introduces waiting
for completion in module's exit routine. I believe it is a big no-no as
something like this will wedge the kernel:
	rmmod <module> < /sys/path/to/devices/attribute
Have you considered using Greg's class_create()/class_destroy() or maybe
bumping up module's refrerence count when registering class devices so
rmmod would fail if there are users of this module?
