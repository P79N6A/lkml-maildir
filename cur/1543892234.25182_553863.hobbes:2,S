Documentation/SubmittingDrivers
Documentation/SubmittingPatches
Documentation/SubmitChecklist
Documentation/ManagementStyle

Good LKML archives to search :
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel
http://lkml.org/
Sometimes good summaries of discussions / decision making processes
can also be found at 
http://kerneltrap.org/
You can also search the ChangeLog messages for different patches
easily via git-web:
