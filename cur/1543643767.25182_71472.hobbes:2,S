Subject: support for offset > 2GB on x86 in losetup needed

 Hello, 
 Currently linux-2.4 on x86  doesn't allow to use offsets greater than 2GB
for losetup utility. Looking at the code, it turns out that the kernel is
guilty - linux kernel doesn't allow offsets greater than 2Gb since it uses
32-bit wide signed (why signed?) integer for storing the offset on x86..
 That's a very severe limitation IMHO, it would be very nice to fix this in
2.5 at least (but it would be better to fix it in 2.4 of course :).
 What do you think about this?
PS: I'm not on the list, so please cc replies to me.
