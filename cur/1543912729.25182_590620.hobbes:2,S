and, as i've said before, i disagree.  while one might debate what
those words *mean*, or which features should be tagged thusly, i think
there's a measurable value to be able to, with one mouse click, say
you want to do a build test on the kernel which does not incorporate
anything deemed deprecated and/or obsolete.  if you don't agree,
however, no amount of explaining that on my part is going to change
your opinion.
