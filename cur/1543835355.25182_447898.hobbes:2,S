Dear kernel developers,
I own a Sony VAIO laptop that uses ACPI for setting screen brightness
through the "2.6-sony_acpi4.patch" patch that has been living in -mm for a while.
I'd like this patch to be merged in mainline, so that I won't be forced anymore to patch
the kernel by hand or to use the -mm patchset.
Is there something that prevents this to happen?
