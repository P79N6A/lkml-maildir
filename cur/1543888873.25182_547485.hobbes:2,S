That's the plan; the kernel just provides mechanism. The architecture
used in the X server splits precisely at this point with the mechanism
in the driver and the configuration and policy up in the X server
proper. Quite a bit of that code could be broken out into a shared
library for fbdev-based apps and the X server to share, but that's down
the road a bit after the kernel APIs look a lot more solid.
With the goal of getting to a single-mode-set boot to avoid screen
flashing before login, the key here is to make any early user-mode
graphics apps share the same kernel graphics infrastructure as the X
server to identify the common cases where the startup and X modes are
the same and avoid resetting the configuration.
