page coloring problem?
i was under the impression on anything 8-way-associative or better the
page coloring improvements were negligible for real-world benchmarks
(ie. kernel compiles)
... or is this more an artifact that even though the improvements for
real-world are negligible, micro-benchmarks are susceptible to these
variations this making things like the std. dev. larger than it would
otherwise be?
