Subject: [PATCH] drivers/isdn/eicon/eicon_idi.c: (2.5.17) dev_kfree_skb on wrong variable
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
        The patch below changes one of the dev_kfree_skb() calls, which
incorrectly frees the wrong variable, and leaves some memory orphaned.
Specifically, in idi_send_data(), two skb's, "xmit_skb" and "skb2" are
allocated with alloc_skb. A check is made to see if either allocation
failed; if one did, whichever one (if at all) succeeded is
dev_kfree_skb()'d, and the function returns an error message. One of
these dev_kfree_skb() calls was freeing "skb" instead of "xmit_skb".
        Looking at the other calls to idi_send_data() and the rest of
the function, I believe "skb" should still be dev_kfree_skb()'d prior to
the return, but I am not 100% sure. The maintainer should look into this
and fix it if necessary.
