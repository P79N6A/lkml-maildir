Subject: [RFC PATCH 10/10] add swapped in pages to the inactive list
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/3/130

Swapin_readahead can read in a lot of data that the processes in
memory never need.  Adding swap cache pages to the inactive list
prevents them from putting too much pressure on the working set.
This has the potential to help the programs that are already in
memory, but it could also be a disadvantage to processes that
are trying to get swapped in.
In short, this patch needs testing.
