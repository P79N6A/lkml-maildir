That's what it looks like when you are inside it.

You inherit the rights of the new directory.
Also - under Netware not all permissions are stored with the file. The 
rights are calculated from the file heirachy so you don't store a lot of 
data with each file unless the file has permissions set that is 
different than that of the directory it's in. So moving a file to 
someone's home directory doesn't require any permissions to be set to 
give the user rights to the file.

It doesn't really make sense to use the /tmp directory the way Unix uses 
it. Why would you want just anyone to even know the names of the 
temporary files you are using. Users should have their own temp 
directory or create their own directory within /tmp
But - to address your question - if there were an invisible (to you) 
file in a directory that you had create rights to then you would get a 
file creation error.

I'm not familiar with Plan 9.

That's why I'm pushing netware as a model rather than windows. But 
Windows file permissions are superior to Linux.

One place where Windows wins over Linux is in the "easy to use" 
category. Something the Linux world should look ast.
I am a Linux supporter and love it. I'm saying this to help make it better.
