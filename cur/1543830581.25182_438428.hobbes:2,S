Makes sense for the host side to have naming convention tied
to the guest. Example as a prefix: guest0-eth0. Would it not
be interesting to have the host also manage these interfaces
via standard tools like ip or ifconfig etc? i.e if i admin up
guest0-eth0, then the user in guest0 will see its eth0 going
up.
Anyways, interesting discussion.
