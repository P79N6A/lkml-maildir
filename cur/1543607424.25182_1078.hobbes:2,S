Well, looks like Linus won't let this one pass ;) A /proc/sgbusy would
eventually be ok, but I'd rather start defining a proper interface
to the PM daemon in userland for apps to request that the machine
doesn't go to sleep. That would be used, among other things, by
CD burners & firmware updaters. No need to hack thousands of apps,
I beleive if we get a patch implementing support for that in cdrecord,
then all burners software will magically start getting it ;)
