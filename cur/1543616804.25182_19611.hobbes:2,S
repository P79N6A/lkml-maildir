Note: said patches are against relatively old 2.4 trees.  They demonstrate
that quite a few things can be moved to userland, however it's mostly
proof-of-concept stuff.  In particular
	* in the final variant we let the loader to leave archive(s)
in core, rather than linking them into the kernel image.
	* nfsroot.c is *crap*
	* quite a few things are currently done better (modulo moving
init/do_mounts.c code in userland process).  IOW, reduction to syscalls
could be (and already is) done better than in these patches.
I'll put current version of that stuff for public testing, but that
will happen after the current mess with kdev_t/struct block_device *
will be resolved...
