Certainly I would like to not hold the BKL so much, but I'm curious
how much effect it will really have.  Do you have any data on the
effect of this change?
Also, I would much rather drop the lock in nfsd_dispatch() and then go
around reclaiming it whereever it was needed.
Subsequently we would drop the lock in nfsd() and make sure sunrpc is
safe. 
This would be more work (any volunteers?:-) but I feel that dropping
it in little places like this is a bit unsatisfying.
Thanks for the input,
NeilBrown
