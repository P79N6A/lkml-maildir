I guess you know ;)
e.g. via page table tricks from user space, like the PAE mode on IA32
or via kmap.

I am just curious why you didn't consider that case when designing the
interfaces. Was that a deliberate decision or just an oversight?

That's currently the case, but at least on IA32 the block layer must be
fixed soon because it's a serious performance problem in some cases
(and fixing it is not very hard). Now that will probably first use DAC
and not a IO-MMU, and thus not use the pci mapping API, but I would not be 
surprised if people came up with IO-MMU schemes for it too.
[actually most IA32 boxes already have one in form of the AGP GART, it's just
not commonly used for serious things yet]
