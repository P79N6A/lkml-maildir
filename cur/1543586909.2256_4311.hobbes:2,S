Yes, but the vendor screwed it up (probably to save money).  This is
_very_ common.  It is very unusual to have a multifunction I/O card
that gets this right (in fact Lava is the only one I can think of
off-hand).

If we have to do this, then Gunther's approach (multifunc_quirks or
whatever) looks a lot better than having a separate driver for every
single multi-IO card.
