Whee. What a piece of "interesting hardware".

I really think that your patch is a bit questionable. The wmb() on the 
sender side looks correct as-is, and to me it looks like it is the 
_receiver_ side that might need a read-barrier before it reads 
call_data(). 
I really thought that the interrupt should be a serializing event, but I 
can't find that in the intel databooks (they make "iret" a serializing 
instruction, but not _taking_ an interrupt, unless I missed something).
Can you check if you get the right behaviour if you have a read barrier in 
the receive path? I actually think we need a full mb() on _both_ paths, 
since the current wmb() only guarantees that writes will be seen "in 
order wrt other writes", and while the IPI generation really _is_ a write 
in itself, I wonder if the Intel CPU's might not consider it something 
special..
I'm not opposed to your patch per se, but I really do believe that it is 
potentially wrong. If we have no serialization on the read side, your 
patch might not actually fully plug the real bug, only hide it. I'd like 
to know if a read barrier on the read side (without the full barrier on 
the write side) is sufficient. It _should_ be (but see my worry about the 
APIC write maybe being considered "outside the scope" of the normal cache 
coherency protocols).
