By reading only known persons[1]? Fine, it is OK.
But i hope, i did useful statements. In fact, noise reduction stuff WRT
bug reports was before in my analysis of Adrian's POV here (reportbug
tool). Also it showed again, when i've wrote about traces, where testers
(bug reporters) can find test cases, before they will cry (again) about
some issues. I see this, example is bugzilla @ mozilla -- known history.
[1] Noise filtering -- that's obvious for me, after all :)
By not flaming further, i'm just going to try to implement something.
Hopefully my next patch will be usefully smart tracked.
Thanks!
