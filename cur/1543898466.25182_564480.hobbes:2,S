Your cd rom failed to complete the TUR command your program issued in
the specified timeout.  ODDs sometimes take quite long to finish TUR or
any other command when media is changed.  Did you use sg command or
cdrom ioctl?
Anyways, after timing out, libata EH kicked the cdrom in the ass and
world peace is restored.
