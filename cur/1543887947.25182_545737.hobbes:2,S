I already did this. I had a broken aeneon DIMM at first. I got a new 
working one.
But the crashes were still there. Then I got a samsung DIMM instead and 
it did
not get better. Therefore I think that the memory is not causing this.
Actually the system freezes when I click somewhere with my USB mouse, even
with no load at all. Unfortunately the system does not have a serial 
port for
a serial console. Netconsole was not working with the via-rhine. I wanted to
try serial console over ttyUSB, but I did not have time for it, yet.
