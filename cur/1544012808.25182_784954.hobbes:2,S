Everyone and their grandmother knows how to use email - :)
Significantly fewer people know how to use IRC - :(
The mailing list is archived in various places - :)
IRC chats are rarely archived - :(
Archiving all LKML mail locally is easy - :)
Archiving all of a IRC channel continuously locally is not so easy - :(
Email archives are easily searchable by subject, sender etc - :)
IRC archives are not so easily searchable by subject etc - :(
Email is nicely asynchronous, letting people read and respond at their leisure - :)
IRC chats are not as asynchronous - :(
Patches are easily distributed via email - :)
Patches are not very easily distributed via IRC - :(
IRC channels can be a nice suplement when a few people need to discuss 
something in semi-real-time related to some LKML thread or just some 
kernel related topic, but it's no replacement for the mailing list.
