In this case it is ok because this only happens when transitioning
from 1 CPU to 2 CPUs or vice versa and in both cases the other CPUs
are essentially stopped.
All the other manipulations currently are single byte.
I suppose for your immediate value patches something stronger is needed,
but we can worry about that post .23.

I considered it, but the function would have been at least twice as big
to handle all the corner cases. And for the current callers it's all fine.

Splitting it would also seem quite awkward.

You could as well call vmap directly then; it's not that much
more complicated.  I don't really see much value in complicating
it right now.
