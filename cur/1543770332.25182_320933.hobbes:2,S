Mmm.. I'm a little bit rusty here, but I don't think qstor
cares about the order, so long as ports are marked with
ATA_FLAG_PORT_DISABLED before invoking port_stop().
I've tried to allow disabling/enabling individual ports
on-the-fly as needed, even though it never really happens
in practice.  So host_stop() kills the whole chip, whereas
port_stop() I took to mean just one of the four SATA ports.
