Looks like this code does it:
+int sysctl_sched_privileged_nice_level __read_mostly = -19;
allows anything that sets sched_privileged_task one way or another gets 
nice -19, and this is enabled by default.

+	}
presumably that selects out X as a privileged task... and sets it to nice -19 
by default.
