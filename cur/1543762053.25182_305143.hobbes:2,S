Yes, I agree with you.
I'm actively working in the background to split the mptscish driver into
separate bus type drivers.  One for fiber channel, one for SCSI, and
one for eventually SAS.  This was a request from you long time back, at
a time when I tried to submitting a patch having FC transport attributes
support.
I think once I submit that, then we can start taking a looking at supporting
the SPI transport layer.  
I still wonder if the SPI transport layer will work for RAID volumes.  
Do you know if the spi transport layer supports dv on hidden devices in a
raid volume? 
Meaning these hidden physical disks will not been seen by the block layer,
however 
spi transport layer would be aware so dv can be performed those hidden disk?
