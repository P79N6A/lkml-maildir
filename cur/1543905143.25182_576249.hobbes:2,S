No, I was talking about the 1448 bytes segments. But in fact I don't
believe it much because the SACKs are always retransmitted just afterwards.
BTW, some information are missing. It would have been better if the trace
had been read with tcpdump -Svv. We would have got seq numbers and ttl.
Also, we do not know if there's a firewall between both sides. Sometimes,
some IDS identify attacks in crypted traffic and kill connections. It
might have been the case here, with the connection closed one way on an
intermediate firewall.
