It's remarkable how one can wait for months for the next kernel release,
carefully lining up, testing and reviewing the patches for the next

Please don't do this.
Quick review:
- search for "( " and " )", fix.
- Might want to do something about the 512-byte automatic variable in
  get_valid_cis_sector()
- It's full of uint8_t drain bamage.
