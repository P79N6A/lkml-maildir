this sounds like a really good argument for having a useable userspace running. 
we already have the LVM snapshot code in the kernel, so we have the pieces 
available to protect the filesystems, we just need to figure out how to put them 
togeather. (the simpliest way would be to make a new suspend package that 
required the user to use LVM so that snapshots are available, but this is also 
the most disruptive approach)
