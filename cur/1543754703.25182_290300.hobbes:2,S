That's ok, I did not post the message to solve my problem, I posted because I 
though it was a possible bug.  I already worked around the problem by using 
setkeycodes to use keycodes (say) 233 and 234 instead of 243 and 244, then I 
also changed the upper-layer software to expect 233 and 234 and execute 
actions that would normally be executed if 243 or 244 was pressed.
Thank you for the information and the useful link.
P.S.  The problem was
atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0xf4 on isa0060/serio0). 
atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes e074 <keycode>' to make it known
Then after using setkeycodes e074 244 that's correct code for my computer 
(Omnibook XE3 GF), I had
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 244
