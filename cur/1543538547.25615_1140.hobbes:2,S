Hi!
I would like to have a linux isdn device which makes it possible to have
directly access to the isdn features, not using AT-commands like on
ttyI. This would make it much easier to write applications and would
make it possible that applications can use all the features ISDN offers.
Is there anybody allready writing on such a driver? (It doesn't make
sense to invent that thing twice)
I would like to contribute to such a project if it already exists.
Or I would like to start a new project with this idea.
The device should have the following properties:
-------------------------------------------------
A ISDN Phone-application should open this device for reading/writing and
send commands via ioctrl.
read() and write() are used to read/write the (audio)-data from/to the
B-channel.
They return the bytes read/written or 0 if no bytes could be read
because the line was not hooked up.
There should be an ioctl for hook up. After using it you "hear" the
dialtone with read() from the device or giving keypad commands by
sending audio data of DTMF-tones with write() to the device.
You can use then ioctl to dial a number.
The status of the line can be asked with ioctls and the process could be
informed with SIGURG signals when something changes (like "connection
established" or "busy" or "the number is incorrect" or other status
messages)
You can "hear" by read() on the device, what you hear from the Telekom
when you dial on a real telephone, like 
"Kein Anschluß unter dieser Nummer"/"The number you dialed is incorrect"
You can use ISDN features like "callback after busy"
It should be possible to communicate with a picture telephone like the
T-View 100 from Telekom (video by using a frame grabber card and a
camera).
Greetings, Michael
