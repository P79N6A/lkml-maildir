Subject: Call for Presentations: Kernel Summit Dissenters Session
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Do you think there is an area where the kernel developers are making a
fundamental mistake?  Is there a better path we should be taking?  If
you have a better idea - and are willing to argue your point in front of
several dozen assembled kernel hackers - please consider writing a
proposal for the 2006 Kernel Summit Dissenter's Session.
The program committee will review submitted proposals, looking for those
which seem most likely to result in an interesting and useful
discussion.  A selected proposal will entitle the author to a seat at
the Summit (with the possibility of travel assistance if needed), and a
20-minute slot during the Dissenter's Session.  A five-minute
presentation will be given, followed by fifteen minutes of discussion.
Ottawa has plenty of purveyors of good beer for recovery afterward.
If you are interested in presenting at the summit, please put together a
proposal of no more than 400 words and send it to the discussion list:
        ksummit-2006-discuss@thunk.org
Proposals should describe the problem, how things should have been done
differently, and what can be done to fix it now.  Winning proposals will
avoid topics which have been discussed into the ground (no devfs or C++,
please), and will cover a topic of interest to a large subset of the
development community.  Proposals should be submitted by 20 May 2006.
