Hi all,
The problem with pivot_root that appeared in 2.4.21-ac4 and the 
2.4.22-pre kernels is now solved (at least for my case) by applying the 
trvial patch sent by Jason Baron.

I tried that on my system and it works as expected. The kernel processes
close their fds and the old root fs can thus be unmounted after
pivot_root. Thanks for the hint !
So the problem is solved for me and it would be wonderful to get it into
2.4.22.
best regards,
Rene
