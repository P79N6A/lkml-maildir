Well, yes, but I was illustrating the complete generic technique.  If
you put all the defines in appropriate other headers, then all you need
are the #include ANGLE_INCLUDE(baz.h) and #include QUOTE_INCLUDE(baz.h)
lines :-D.

Somone asked me why I work on this free (

)
software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best  
answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do  
it because
life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why I  
draw
cartoons. It's my life."
