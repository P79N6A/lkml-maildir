If I open the damn box, I sure as hell can be bothered to edit stuff in

Then we'd better have a very good idea of the things that are going to
break.  Note that right now even late-boot code in kernel itself will
break on that - there are explicit checks for ROOT_DEV==MKDEV(2,0),
all sorts of weird crap deep in the bowels of arch/ppc/*/*, etc.
It won't be an easy transition - I know that Greg is very optimistic
about it, but there will be a *lot* of crap to take care of.  In theory
getting bigger dev_t should've been very straightforward, but if you
check what really had been involved...
ObOtherStraightforwardThings: net_device refcounting.  Take a look at
Jeff's queue someday - by now it's one big merge short of getting it
right for practically all drivers.  1.9Mb total + 247Kb pending patches
here.  Several hundreds changesets, practically all of them fixing
exploitable holes.  And yes, most of them had been bugs all along -
since 2.2 if not earlier.  Sure, that made things better, but if somebody
comes along and makes similar "fun" necessary for e.g. ALSA...

Heh.  Took you long enough - "using pine" should've been a dead giveaway
from the very beginning ;-)
