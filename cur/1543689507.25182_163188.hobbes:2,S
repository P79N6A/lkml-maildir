This is boggling.

Is there anyway that you remember what the Oops was (i.e. the few lines 
above the back trace)? 
Also, could you please confirm that you're using 2.6.0-test4 + the PM
patches I posted last Saturday + the patch I posted yesterday? I trust
that you are, however I cannot reproduce the Oops at all. 
The Oops looks the one that was present in -test4 initially, but why 
you're able to at least begin a suspend-to-disk transition doesn't make 
sense.

Based on your dmesg here: 
http://perso.nerim.net/~tudia/bug-reports/2.6.0-pre4-pm
Your system does not support S3, so returning immediately would be the 
proper thing to do. I will continue to investigate. 
Thanks for testing,
