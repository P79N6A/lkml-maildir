Yes, but you'd want to make sure that you stated that your license
extended to the BK metadata.  In our opinion, only you as the creator
of the repository gets to make that rule but you certainly can, that's
one of the reasons we put that clause in there.
By the way, the way this code works in bk-3.0 is that it saves a md5sum or
some sort of strong hash of the license in question and it will ask you
only once, assuming you are using the same home directory.  It will ask
you again if the license changes, that's what the hash is for.
