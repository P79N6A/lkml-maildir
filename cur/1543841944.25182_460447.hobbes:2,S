I think this is very sane/solid approach.
Maybe this is the way to go. I'll test and ack later, thank you.

I agree with you but..
Becasue this approach has to access *all* task structs in a system,
and have to scan pidhash many times. I'm not sure that this scan & lookup
is good for future implementation. But this patch is obviously better than
current implementation.

How about find_first_used_pid(int nr) ?
