Easy solution: don't run linuxrc, run something else instead. E.g.
putting the following into the kernel's command line should do th
trick:
init=/your_script root=/dev/ram
(With your_script being the original version, without real-root-dev)

Anything involving real-root-dev is likely to be an anachronism.
Combining it with pivot_root just makes it more weird.

I'd consider the "PID of init must be 1" a bit of an anachronism too.
After all, a modern Unix system has quite a few demons that you don't
want to kill either, so why make init special ? But anyway, you don't
need to change init.
