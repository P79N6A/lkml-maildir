Subject: Problem in booting UML with 2.6.8.1 kernel

Hi
I'm trying to run a 2.6.8.1 um kernel on RHEL4.1 host with skas3.
When I start the kernel the boot messages get to "Mounted devfs on /dev"
and then UML is hung. 
I searched the mailing list and found that this was an old issue and by
changing the gcc flag to -O1 from -O2 the problem is solved, but in my
case nothing is happening.
Is there still a bug or did I screw something up? 
I'm starting the UML with:
% ./linux 
The bootlog is as below:
Checking for the skas3 patch in the host...found
Checking for /proc/mm...found
