Hello list,
after switching to 2.6.11-rc5-bk2 (from 2.6.9-rc2), I found that the nvidia 
module (1.0-4996, old, I know) does not compile anymore, because it
requires pci_find_class():
nv.c:
static int
nvos_probe_devices(void)
{
    ...
    struct pci_dev *dev;
    ...
    dev = pci_find_class(PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_VGA << 8, dev);
    ...
}
What function would I need to use, now that pci_find_class is gone?
