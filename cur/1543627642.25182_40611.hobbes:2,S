I'm not sure I believe this.  I have had occasional cases where I
wondered whether the timer tick caused significant overhead, but it
always turned out to be something else.  In my measurements,
*user-level* profiling has the 2-10% overhead you're mentioning, but
that's with a signal delivered to user level on each tick.
