I'd actually like to reserve writes to _sending_ signals. Especially if 
you have another process that listens in on the signals you get, it might 
want to also force the signals through.

It could be a separate system call, but since the infrastructure is 
hopefully identical (most of the sigfd() code is actually creating the fs 
infrastructure to get an inode with the information), it should share a 
lot of the paths. Maybe even the system call.
