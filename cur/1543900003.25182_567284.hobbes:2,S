Good!

I *really* don't want to change the whole gadget stack just to
make one excessively quirky bit of hardware work with it ... when
we know there's a simple solution that doesn't involve that.
(Changing the whole gadget stack would involve retesting a boatload
of systems... not all of which are easily tested.  Plus, those changes
would need far more review than they can get just now.)
So for now, just do what I outlined before:  set up the pxa27x UDC
to resemble the pxa2[156] chips:  a bunch of bulk endpoint with no
altsettings and acting the same in all three hardware-supported configs.
That will support RNDIS.  In fact the only thing it _won't_ handle is
the "real CDC Ethernet" mode.
Once that's working, we can revisit the issue of how to configure
endpoint hardware ... focussing on just that issue, and with enough
flexibility that non-pxa27x hardware can also be addressed.
