If you read from a file descriptor in one process, the file pointer is
moved, and the read from the other process will not get the same bytes
twice.
Seems 'right', although inconvenient might be a better conclusion than
unintuitive... :-)
I wonder if this 'feature' could be taken advantage of somehow? One could
monitor the state of a file descriptor without having access to the file
descriptor... Hmm...
