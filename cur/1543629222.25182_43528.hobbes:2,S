Andrew, judging by the filenames he'd mentioned, I suspect that he runs
innd.  I.e. one of the very few programs heavily using truncate().  And
no, it doesn't promise anything good - last time we had crap in truncate/mmap
interaction it was a hell to fix.
I suspect that you had screwed the truncate exclusion warranties up.  If
_any_ IO happens in the area currently manipulated by ->truncate() - you
are screwed and results would look pretty much like the things mentioned
in bug report.
