The same issue exists with the KERNELSRC and KERNELOUTPUT paths in 
$(objtree)/Makefile: they would also better be relative to each other. In our 
case we have something like:
	KERNELSRC    := /usr/src/linux-2.6.5-7.79
	KERNELOUTPUT := /usr/src/linux-2.6.5-7.79-obj/i386/default
this would become:
	KERNELSRC    := ../../../linux-2.6.5-7.79
	KERNELOUTPUT := ../linux-2.6.5-7.79-obj/i386/default
I am currently regenerating $(objtree)/Makefile by hand by invoking mkmakefile 
with the appropriate parameters. The attached script could be used to 
automate this; it would work equally well for the asm symlink.
