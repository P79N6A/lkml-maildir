I like compiling my own kernel it's just a pain doing it the first

So how do distro's figure out which driver to use? Isn't it a matter
of taking the pci-ids and selecting the correct driver?

It about ease of use, look at the new core2 architecture, if your gcc
is new enough there is a march=core2 else you use an older flag
Same with the new cell architecture you use cell if your using gcc 4.3
alpha or 930 if it's not that new.
What I'm saying is sometimes GCC or the Kernel is better at making
these decisions or at least make it easier
