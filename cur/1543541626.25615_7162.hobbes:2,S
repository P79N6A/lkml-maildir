See earlier emails on why this is unusable for NTFS due to hardlink

Note that if fd_open is dangerous for security, then so is "fchdir()".
Because you can emulate fd_open() with fchdir()+regular open. Slowly, but
still.

No. 
We have had ad-hoc support for some special cases.
Linux hasn't supported them as a notion.

Alan, do you really mean to say that every filesystem that has resource
forks shoul dsolve the problem over and over again, and in different
manners?
It's already been made clear that the HFS solutions is unacceptable for
NTFS.
In contrast, the NTFS solution _would_ be acceptable for HFS.
Think about it. Which one is the better solution?
