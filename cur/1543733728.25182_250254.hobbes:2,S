Thank you  :)
No, I did not write the XFS list - but maybe I should...
I purposedly wrote directly to LKML to get the attention of a "broader
audience".
For example, the lowmem OOM problem may not be fixable by the XFS
developers alone (I don't know), and I've heard whisperings about the
debug.c:106 problem being related to knfsd changes in the 2.6 series
(don't know how credible that is either).
So, I thought, maybe if more people were made aware of this, the right
people would have a chance of figuring this out   :)
