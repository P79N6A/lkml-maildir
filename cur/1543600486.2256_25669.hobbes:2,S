I've just checked, you're right.
In the mainstream 2.4 kernels for local routes setting the source to be equal
to the target overrides the preferred source from the route.
I personally consider it as a bug.
Why do we have preferred source field in the routes if not to override how
the kernel selects the source by itself?
