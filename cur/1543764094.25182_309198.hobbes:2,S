i didnt have 4K stacks set. In all crashes, esp had the same pattern:
 esi: 009b63f9   edi: 00000001   ebp: f543a000   esp: f543bfc8
i.e. esp & 0xfff was 0xfc8 - while i think it should normally be 0xfc4 
(page boundary minus size of pt_regs == 0 - 0x3c == 0xfc4). So somewhere 
we lost 4 bytes of esp? An extra popl, or an addl $4, %esp? But why dont 
we crash in that case - it ought to shift all the pt_regs structure by a 
word, making it a completely senseless return frame. Any task in such a 
situation ought to at least segfault. So if this is during thread 
startup, i dont know how it survives the first execution.
