Good idea. I'd add them to filemap.c.

I saw some code pieces like
                spin_lock_irqsave(&zone->lru_lock, flags);
                VM_BUG_ON(!PageLRU(page));
                __ClearPageLRU(page);
                del_page_from_lru(zone, page);
                spin_unlock_irqrestore(&zone->lru_lock, flags);
They give me an allusion that PG_lru and page->lru are always changed together,
under the protection of zone->lru_lock...
I bet correctness is top priority, so I'll stop playing fire with it.
Thanks,
Wu
