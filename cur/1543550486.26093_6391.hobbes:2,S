It seems that you are ignoring other major distros (Slackware, Suse,
Debian, etc.) as well as commercial software. By providing an incompatible 
binary interface RedHat splits the Linux community into 2 parts. I 
am *very* concerned about this. 
I guess that RedHat (as the owner of Cygnus and working very closely 
with the FSF) would have had sufficient arguments to get an official(!) 
gcc 2.96 before release date of RedHat 7.0.
