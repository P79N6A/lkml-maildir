reporting the first one only is necessary, because the validator cannot 
trust a system's dependency info that it sees as incorrect. Deadlock 
possibilities are quite rare in a kernel that is "in balance". Right now 
we are not "in balance" yet, because the validator has only been added a 
couple of days ago. The flurry of initial fixes will die down quickly.
you can fix the reiser4 false positive (it's likely a false positive) by 
changing the spin_unlock() to spin_unlock_non_nested(). The patch below 
should do that for this specific instance.
Ob'Reiser4'Cleanup:
	spin_unlock(&(mgr->tmgr_lock));
why isnt that:
	spin_unlock(&mgr->tmgr_lock);
? fs/reiser4/*.c is infested with that, the string '(&(' occurs 199 (!) 
times.
also:
        if (atomic_read(&node->d_count) != 0) {
                return 0;
        }
why the braces, when on the next line it's not done:
        if (blocknr_is_fake(jnode_get_block(node)))
                return 0;
it looks quite inconsistent. Also, just a quick look at just about any 
file in reiser4/*.c shows alot of other coding style inconsistencies.
