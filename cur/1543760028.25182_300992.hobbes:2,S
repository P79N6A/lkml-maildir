Hello,
I recently upgraded to 2.4.29 from 2.4.21 and see that the interrupt of
the e1000 device is not being shown when running /sbin/ifconfig.
It would appear that in version 1.56 of e1000_main.c, the e1000_probe
function was modified to store the IRQ of the device in pdev->irq
instead of netdev->irq.
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.4/diffs/drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c@1.56?nav=index.html
|src/|src/drivers|src/drivers/net|src/drivers/net/e1000|hist/drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c
According to the log, this was done "in preparation for MSI support".
However, it would appear that no other Ethernet driver does this.  As a
result, the value is not present in the netdev->irq field, and hence the
SIOCGIFMAP ioctl call does not include the interrupt.
Is this expected behavior?  It would appear that this is a backport from
2.6, so perhaps it should not work this way in stable 2.4 kernels.
Is there any harm in also including the IRQ in the netdev struct, as I
have applications that expect this (such as ifconfig)?
The following patch appears to fix the issue.  I'm just not sure if it
breaks anything else:
