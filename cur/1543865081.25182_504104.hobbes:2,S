Subject: [PATCH 0/10] fix usages of local_irq_save() and local_irq_disable()

Hi,
the following series of 10 trivial patches contains two changes:
- removes local_irq_disable() on redundant places after local_irq_save()
- turns local_save_flags() + local_irq_disable() into local_irq_save()
It was quite surprising to find it on so many places. There is another gem 
in drivers/block/ataflop.c::do_fd_request():
        local_save_flags(flags);        /* The request function is called with ints
        local_irq_disable();             * disabled... so must save the IPL for later */
I am not sure if the author was aware of the fact that he commented also 
the local_irq_disable() call :) I will look into the code a bit more 
later, to see whether it just really wants to save flags, or this should 
be converted into standard local_irq_save(flags).
