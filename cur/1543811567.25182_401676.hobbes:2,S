This one isn't in: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/21/7
Andrew did pick it up -- pnp-bus-type-fix.patch, named as being in the 
2.6.16 queue in his 2.6.16-rc4-mm2 announce:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/24/66
so it's probably okay. The other two patches from that same thread 
already made it into -rc5 though, so thought I'd ping anyway. It does 
really want to make 2.6.16. Many ISA-PnP drivers are quite severely 
broken without (it's also a regression against 2.6.15).
Rene.
