No I'm not.  I'm saying that the bugs which this exposed are a far, far
more serious matter than a few false-positive warnings which need
workarounds.

If it's called in that fashion then the caller should still check the
device_for_each_child() return value to find out if it actually got a
match.
Now it could be that the mysterious caller to which you refer uses the
non-NULLness of some pointer to work out if a match occurred.  Well shrug -
add a BUG_ON(!device_for_each_child_return_value) or something.
Or write a new version of device_for_each_child() which returns void and
don't tell anyone about it.
But let's not encourage error-ignoring.
