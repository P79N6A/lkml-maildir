I believe that you should not believe such things. They are just statistics 
and nothing more. 
If you have a 1000 lines project and:
a) Remove all empty lines means that you remove bugs?
b) Split it to 5 libraries and 5 utilities (10 projects) means that you'll 
have less bugs? 
c) ....
I don't take generalizations like this seriously and I believe that noone 
should do. It may be true that 10.000 lines of code contain 50 bugs as an 
average of all the code that has be written so far but it doesn't mean that:
a) 50 bugs require 10.000 lines
b) 50 bugs will always exist on 10.000 lines
c) All the projects out there have the same number of bugs/line
