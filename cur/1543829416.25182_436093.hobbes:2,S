Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Fix boot on efi 32 bit Machines [try #2]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/23/86

Fix EFI boot on 32 bit machines with pcie port.
Efi machines does not have an e820 memory map.
This bug makes native efi boots on Intel Mac's
impossible.
