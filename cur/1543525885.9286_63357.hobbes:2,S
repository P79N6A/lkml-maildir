What's more it'll do more harm then help. Who will use it ? Advanced users ?
Perhaps. But advanced users can create one-linear script, icon on desktop
(with KDE or GNOME even not-so-advanced user can do this :-), etc. No problem.
Dumb user ? Such user will eventually corrunt filesystem on floppy and will
blame Linux for this (simpliest scenario: open file in MC viewer, then delete
it from other MC window). If you want to support only "smart floppies" (ZIP,
MO, etc) you can do this with autofs. WHO will benefit from such patch anyway ?
Do we really need bad press about Linux ?

The are exist solution for decent floppies: autofs. It works with decent
floppies (NOT standard 3" & 5" floppies but ZIP, MO, etc) exactly like NT does,
for example. Whatthe problem ?

You missed one important thing: what to do with situation where system CAN
NOT be correctly detached (that is floppy can not be easily ejected). One
such situation is outlined above and it's just simples case ...

Please describe what you mean by "clean management" and what's not clean
with autofs ?
P.S. I see only one problem with autofs: you can not eject disk when it's
not actually used but merely opened in filemanager. IMO it can be arranged
with changes in drivers, autofs & file managers so said window can be closed
automagically on eject request.
