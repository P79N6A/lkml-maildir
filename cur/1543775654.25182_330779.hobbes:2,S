hmm. I wonder if a slightly different approach (based on the __slow)
idea would make sense
1) Use -ffunction-sections option from gcc to put each function in it's
own section
2) Use readprofile/oprofile data to collect an (external to the code)
list of hot/cold functions (we can put a default list in the kernel
source somewhere and allow people to measure their own if they want)
3) Use this list to make a linker script to order the functions
this way we don't need to put a lot of __slow's in the code *and* it's
based on measurements not assumptions, and can be tuned for a specific
situation in addition.
