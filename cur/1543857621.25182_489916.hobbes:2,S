This driver is an AC97 codec according to its help text.
However, if SOUND is disabled, the "select SND_AC97_BUS"
still inserts that into the .config file:
#
# Sound
#
# CONFIG_SOUND is not set
CONFIG_SND_AC97_BUS=m
Even if the config software followed dependency chains on selects,
we should try to limit usage of "select" to library-type
code that is needed (e.g., CRC functions) instead of bus-type
support.
