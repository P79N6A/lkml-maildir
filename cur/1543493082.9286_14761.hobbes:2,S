Andrea,
Affinity is much better:-) The compute bound task remains on the same cpu for
much longer periods of time.  My guess is about 40 seconds on average. 
Sometimes as long as a few minutes:-) 
As I write this email in Netscape I can cause the "half hour" task to move to
the other processor by dragging the mail window over the communicator window,
causing refresh activity. I assume at this point there are at least three
"big=>compute bound" tasks competing for cpu resources.  But when the "half
hour" task is rescheduled, it often forgets where it was, or finds that the
correct processor was not available when it was rescheduled? It seems that the
scheduler needs a long memory?
Thanks for the patch.  If there are any quantitative tests I can run please let
me know.
