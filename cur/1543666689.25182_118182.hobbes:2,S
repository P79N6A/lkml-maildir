That was implied in Dave's remark and in my answer.

We can't do that as that should be done for all the supported processors.
Furthermore, it is the compiler's job to produce the best machine code.
The only thing we can do to help the compiler is write simple code.  From
a logical point of view, oring is what is needed here, and from a hardware
point of view oring is cheaper than adding.
