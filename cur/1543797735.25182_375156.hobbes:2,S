Is there any downside to this?  I ask because accesses through
this 'cpuset_cache' pointer are rather infrequent - only when
the sysadmin or the batch scheduler is creating or removing
cpusets, which for the purposes of 'back of the envelope'
estimates, might be once a minute or less.  Further, it is
not at all a performance critical path.
So I really don't give a dang if it takes a few milliseconds
to pick up this pointer, at least so far as cpusets matters.
That said, would you still advise marking this __read_mostly?

So I suppose what I should really have is:
  static struct kmem_cache *cpuset_cache __read_mostly;
??
