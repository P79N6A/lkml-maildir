Alas, that doesn't explain the minicom on console problem.  It's almost as
if something in the tty subsystem is leading to single threaded behaviour
for all ttys.  Looking through the serial driver, it's still using the
global irq lock all over the place, plus such things as doing a
cli()/sti() pair around memcpy()s in rs_write.  EEEEK!  TTY_DONT_FLIP gets
set while doing put_users....
Anybody want to start chatting about tty overhauls? =)
