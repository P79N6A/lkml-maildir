Groovy.  FWIW (if it wasn't obvious from context) my objection in
general to the driver is withdrawn, since you explained it is RAID and
not an ATA driver.
I would really like to work on consolidating the ATA code in libata,
though.  As the name implies, it's a library -- don't feel that your
driver must conform to the libata driver API in order to make use of all
its functions.  And feel free to add to it.
