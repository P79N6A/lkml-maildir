Hi Hugh,
as we still have to stuck with 2.4.7 I applied your patch, but the problem
isn´t fully solved. The error message still appears.
In some minutes I am going to vacation so for further questions, write to
Martin Schwidefsky. (schwidefsky@de.ibm.com) and cc Ulrich Weigand
(Ulrich.Weigand@de.ibm.com).
Sorry.
Bytheway now the messages were:
