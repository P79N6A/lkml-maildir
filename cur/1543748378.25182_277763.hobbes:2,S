Hello,
  I ran make tags in 2.6.7 to create a tags file on 2.6.7 kernel source 
tree.
	The tags mechanism works OK for me with this tag file,
	except in one subfolder , which is fs (and all it's subfolder).
	This means that when I try "follow tags" in a file under fs or
	one of it's subdir, not a sinlge possibility is showed.
	(I use jedit tags plugin ).
	I would like to know if anyone using "make tags" on this version/other 
versions
	had encounterd such problems.
	regards,
Sting
