So, why so much patch to do what's already available in the kernel?  With
LSM, plus audit, you can generate events that userspace can consume via
netlink w/out this /proc stuff, and sys_call_table symbol lookup stuff,
the kernel hooks, etc.
How about starting by showing exactly what pieces are missing in the
kernel?  This looks like things that can easily be done using existing
infrastructure.
