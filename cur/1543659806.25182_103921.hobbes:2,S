please look at this new run queue thing in process context for kernel modules,
and the fact that non GPL modules cannot create an own queue, but have to use
the default one (all queue are managed by a kernel thread).
As you see, for linux 2.6 the big picture will acquire a new element.
(Personally I do like it a lot, as mutch as I like all the run queue approach)
This as quite interesting implications, since it is a penalty for binary only
modules.
