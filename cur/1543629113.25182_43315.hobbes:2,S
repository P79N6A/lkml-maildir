The IDE support for your chipset is known to have various quirks on 2.4.18
and below.
I don't follow 2.2 kernels so I've no advice for them. For 2.4 kernels
please try at least 2.4.19-pre7 or 2.4.19-pre3-ac1.
Trying 2.3.x kernels seems a waste of time (unless you points to the precise
patch that brings instabilily to your system) and 2.5.x is audacious to say the
least.
Looking at the last kernel messages (/var/log/message) before your crashes
might help locate the problem's origin.
For guidelines on bug reporting, please take a look at the
"REPORTING-BUGS" file at the root of your kernel source tree.
