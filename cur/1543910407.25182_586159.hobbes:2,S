And yet when I used that, I got compiler warnings on some systems.
ISTR that was the first solution I tried, but GCC really wanted to
issue warnings.  Either about casting 64-bit to pointer, or about
casting it to "unsigned long", either way lost precision.

So with 32 bit userspace "unsigned long long" is the type to use
when talking to a 64-bit kernel; and with pure 64-bit code, it's
enough to write "unsigned long".
I'm fairly sure that's the root cause of the pain I recall here;
but I'd have to run experiments again to verify that.
