The oldest kernel i've tried is 2.4.10-ac11 on my SMP box and my
mysterious "hangs" (10-20s at a time) disappeared when i switched to
2.4.17-pre2. The box is dual P3 on Serverworks LE chipset. I tried
switching cards from the onboard eepro100 to a seperate dual eepro100 card
and that also exhibited the same problems, so there *might* be something
with the driver. Currently i'm using 3c59x, but i can still test with the
onboard eepro100, let me know if you need guinea pigs.
