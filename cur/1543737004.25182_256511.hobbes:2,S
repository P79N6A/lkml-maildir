As far as I could see, none of the posted patches are needed, or rather
the correct one(s) is already included in the kernel. The older ones
were workarounds, not needed anymore, thus obsolete.
The only problem is the apic timer thing. It just gets activated if the
correct BIOS Version is found (see the dmi scan thingie). So I just pass
acpi_skip_timer_override to the kernel to be sure.

It is safe but makes your CPU hotter. Thus the real fix just changes the
disconnect intervall (or alike). Look into arch/i386/pci/fixup.h and
search for nforce2.
