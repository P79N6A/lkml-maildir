I'd be more than happy to see the back of the intermodule crap. I don't
recall seeing patches to remove it again that I'm happy with -- although
you're right, I'm easily distracted.
I'd actually like to go through the whole CFI chip probe and command set
selection crap, understand it all again, and make myself happy with it
rather than just hacking it up further. It's too convoluted, and some of
the reasons for that are no longer relevant.
(Please don't use my broken SPF-afflicted email address, btw. That
address should no longer be present in the kernel sources or
MAINTAINERS.)
