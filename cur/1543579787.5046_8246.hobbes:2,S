Yeah, I've been bitten by this quite often.  Basically, just edit arch/alpha/kernel/Makefile and remove irq_pyxis.c from the obj-y
line.  I'm not positive what systems require it exactly, but rawhide isn't one of them.  I have a totally separate patch from Andrea
that suggests (to my mind) that it is required for: GENERIC, CIA, CABRIOLET, EV164, EB66P, LX164, PC164, MIATA, RUFFIAN and SX164.  Does
someone want to verify that and then a quickie patch can be whipped up and sent in.
