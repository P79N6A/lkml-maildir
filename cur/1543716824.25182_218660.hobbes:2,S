I'm not generally opposed, but have a couple questions.
1) Why does userspace / humans need to know this?  For debugging firmware?
2) Can the memory map output ever be larger than PAGE_SIZE (lower
limit is 4KB on x86)?  If not, what guarantees that?  If so, you need
your own read mechanism rather than the generic sysfs one.
The one-value-per-file rule has an exception for an array of values of
the same type per Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.txt, which this
looks to adhere to.
Thanks,
Matt
