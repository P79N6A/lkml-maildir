Dan-
Thank you for taking the time to contact Road Runner.
The administrators of the ORBS project would frequently scan our members
systems for open mail relays without ours, or our members, permission. We
have previously informed the ORBS administrators know that this practice
was unacceptable, and they did not have our consent to perform these
system-wide sweeps on our networks or our members. ORBS continued to probe
our networks, and members, after we had asked them to stop.
Road Runner strongly believes that any decisions regarding scans on our
systems or our members should be left up to the local Road Runner
affiliates and that the results of the scans should be kept private to
minimize potential abuse. Road Runner views member privacy as a top
priority. We cannot let outside entities probe our network and keep a
database of our members services. In fact, we have already designed an open
relay scanner that is more efficient and not service impacting. The results
of the scan are only known to the individual Road Runner member and Road
Runner Security staff.
Since we can already provide this service and because we feel that the ORBS
scans are an invasion of members privacy, we have implemented measures to
prevent ORBS from scanning our networks.
It was our sincere hope that administrators of ORBS conducted their business
as usual and leave Road Runner out of it. While we did not think ORBS would
be petty enough to block our entire range they surprised us. When we find 
out that our members
are being adversely effected by mail administrators who subscribe to the 
ORBS list, then we will encourage our members to work with those individual 
mail administrators, one on one, to help them choose alternatives to the 
ORBS list. There are other more effective blocking lists available to mail 
administrators that we are happy to help them configure.

With this information I hope you can see our reasoning behind the block and 
bear with us while we try to resolve any problems it may cause.
Sincerely-
Road Runner Security
