Hmm, assume my activity at the computer requires 10% CPU time when the
CPU is at full speed. My power consumption will then be
        P_fullspeed = P_static + 0.9 * P_idle_hi + 0.1 * P_busy_hi
If I halve the clock frequency, the computer will require 20% CPU time
to perform the work, and the power consumption becomes
        P_halfspeed = P_static + 0.8 * P_idle_lo + 0.2 * P_busy_lo
If the voltage doesn't change, 0.1 * P_busy_hi == 0.2 * P_busy_lo, so
the power savings will be
        P_fullspeed - P_halfspeed = 0.9 * P_idle_hi - 0.8 * P_idle_lo
or
        deltaP = 0.1 * P_idle_hi + 0.8 * (P_idle_hi - P_idle_lo)
The first term will be smaller the more idle my CPU is. (When reading
mail, I think 99% idle time is closer to the truth than 90%). The
second term in this formula is the reason I wondered if the power
consumption in apm idle mode is lower at lower clock frequencies.
