One more reason for that that came out only recently: suppore we're 
adding transfers to an already configured message (i. e. with some 
transfers set up already). This 'chaning' may happen for some kinds of 
devices. And in case transfers is an array, we should either be apriory 
aware of whether the chaining will take place or allocate an array large 
enough to hold additional transfers. Neither of these look good to me, 
and having a linked list of transfers will definitely solve this problem.
