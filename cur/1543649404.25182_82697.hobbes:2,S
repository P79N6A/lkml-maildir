So that evicted pages in non-linear mappings can be reestablished
at fault time by the kernel, rather than by delegation to userspace
via SIGBUS.
We seem to have lost a pte_page_unlock() from fremap.c:zap_pte()?
I fixed up the ifdef tangle in there within the shpte-ng patch
and then put the pte_page_unlock() back.
I also added a page_cache_release() to the error path in filemap_populate(),
if install_page() failed.
The 2TB file size limit for mmap on non-PAE is a little worrisome.
I wonder if we can only instantiate the pte_file() bit if the
mapping is using MAP_POPULATE?  Seems hard to do.
