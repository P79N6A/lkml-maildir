Also, if less than <n> percent of the volume is free, files will not be
decompressed, and compressed files can only be addressed through
realtime decompression.

That is of course not the case. When a file is decompressed (or
compressed) a new file is created, and once the (de)compression is
completed, a delete and rename will be performed, and this is, if I
remember correctly, transaction based, so the file will not be lost in
case a powerfail should occur.
