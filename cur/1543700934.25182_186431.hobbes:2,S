Mmm. Doesn't seem that way to me. What have I missed?

Didn't seem to difficult to me when I checked out both systems this last 
few days. In fact I like'em both.

Some how I don't think that's the reason for that statement.

Looks to me like that was never the aim of sysfs. I haven't checked into 
sysfs yet but I suspect it is quite different to devfs.

That would take away the ability to have a changeable device naming 
scheme. One of the main reasons for having dynamic device name mapping 
system is to map the names from a device detection system to specified 
(possibly changing) naming scheme.
Please don't get me wrong. I like devfs very much and I see it has come a 
long way since I last used it, but it needs work just to maintain its 
current functionality within 2.6.
