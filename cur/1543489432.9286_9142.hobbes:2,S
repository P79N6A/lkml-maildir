I realize that, I want to do what I should do to fix the problem.
dpkg shouldn't generate the error message. First I have to
know if the problem is the kernel or dpkg...
IMHO, it is the kernel that is broken, because it should be
able to emulate normal Unix filesystem properties on NFS (ie
NFS should appear just the same as other filesystems).
