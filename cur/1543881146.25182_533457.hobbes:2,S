AFAIR it's stored twice on FAT32, once in a backup sector and once in the
superblock or extended superblock (don't remember, I think it was the
extended ~). It's not stored on FAT{12,16}.

Windows _does_ care*, it will pretend the disk to be full. Therefore the
stored value *SHOULD* be updated. (I think your patch does this.)
Recalculating the free space is a nice idea, and modern hardware might be
fast enough to recalculate the value on mount by default. (I didn't try this
for years.) Maybe the default should depend on arch?
About this patch: (news:8cwz8-2fE-13@gated-at.bofh.it)
- usefree is a bad name (I'd suggest recalc_free instead), and your
  description is too cryptic to be understood by a non-linux FAT expert.

Never forget: 2 + 2 = 5 for extremely large values of 2.
