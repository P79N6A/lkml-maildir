Why is it that 2.2.15p10 boots and runs fine, but
these new 2.3.4x kernels don't like 2 drives on the
same ide controller.
  [ Yes, I'm going to open up the computer an pull out
    that 2gb drive soon ... ]
It seems like the 2.3.4x kernels are going in the
wrong direction (as far as it appears to me).
With the latest pre-patch-2.3.48-2 I get errors
 like  
  hdb: unable to read partition table
or it reports that the super block is corrupted
When I reboot into 2.2.15p10 there is not corruption,
and everything seems to be fine.
