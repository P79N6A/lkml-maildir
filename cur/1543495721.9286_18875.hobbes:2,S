I thought that running wmb() in cpu 1 was forcing the CPU1 to write
ordered in memory, but nothing more. So according to me writing in-order
using CPU 1, doesn't imply that CPU 2 will be forced to read in-order too
from memory (and even if it will be forced in x86 that's not enough).
This is why I think that to force CPU 2 to read in-order we must use
rmb(), even if the other cpu uses wmb() to allow us to read the right
thing if we synchronize our reads too.
I would like to know if my understanding of wmb() is wrong ;).
