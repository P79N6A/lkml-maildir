Oh not this one again.
The checksum of the tcp header or UDP header covers the entire packet after
reassembly. That means that feeding in a corrupt fragment causes a checksum
failure and packet discard.
The original TCP authors had that one covered. IP sequence space is shorter
than max ttl so all protocols need to be robust against suprise
fragment delivery.

This URL has nothing to do with IP sequence guessing. It references some old
unrelated 2.0.3x thing.
