That's a very short time compared with an OOMing thrash: no worries there.

They'll try to use the mempool, maybe some will be allowed to wait
for their kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) memory, and others will be PF_MEMDIEd and
proceed to take a reserved mempool buffer, and others will be PF_MEMDIEd
and have to wait for a reserved mempool buffer.  Which will be released
to them in due course.  No worries there.

No, they take their turns.  It's sure not as efficient as each getting
a kmalloc'ed buffer immediately, but its failures will be rare.  And
it doesn't matter whether the failures only occur when heading for
OOM-kill or not: we just don't want failure to be the common case.
If kmalloc evolves into something that normally fails half the time,
well, I'd think that'd be called a bug.

No.  There may be other situations which might need at least
NR_CPUS reserved mempool buffer to avoid deadlock, but that's not
the case here.  Looks like mempool will be superseded as you wish
in the IPC context, fine; but I do think you need to take a look
at mempool_alloc: it's a different beast from what you suppose.
