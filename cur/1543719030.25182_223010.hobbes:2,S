The eviction speed should not be a limitation, unless the machine is
ill-configured. Some pages aren't dirty, and can be dropped instantly.
That is way faster than any storage solution.
Other pages have to be written out (to swap, or to some file because
it is a pending write.)  This is not a problem, because io out
is as fast as io in.  If you have big iron with a superfast array - sure,
your io comes in at tremendous speed.  But swap and other writes
go out at the same tremendous speed too.  So no problem.
Now if you have a big-iron machine with filesystems on a fast array
and swap on a single slow disk then you're in trouble.  But that
is a bad setup, not a kernel problem.
