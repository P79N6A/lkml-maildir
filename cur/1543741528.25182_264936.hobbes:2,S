Well, Larry, to be perfectly honest - the documentation is ... terse, at
the moment.
Yes, I know, documentation isn't fun - it probably needs an editor to
go over it and say, "What assumptions should we make about the knowledge
a user has?" and then try really hard to keep that list *short* and
strictly adhered to in all the pages.
Oh, and I *do* play a paying customer at my day job.  Just some days I
wish the documentation was a little more helpful.  (Specifically, you
desperately need more examples of triggers.)
