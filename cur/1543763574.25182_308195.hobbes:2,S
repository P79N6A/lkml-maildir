That's probably not a bad idea. You'd have to do things like
set RT scheduling for your user tasks, and not have any other
activity happening. So that effectively hangs your system for
a while anyway.
But if you run it once and dump the output to a config file...
Anyway we're faced with the immediate problem of crap performance
for 2.6.12 (for people with 1500 disks), so an in-kernel solution
might be better in the short term. I'll see if we can adapt Ingo's
thingy with something that is "good enough" and doesn't take years
to run on a 512 way.
