It's a hassle when someone doesn't have a bugzilla account.  But there are
humans sitting behind bugzilla handling stuff (fsvo "human").  I've already
forwarded your bugzilla report to Stephane pointing out that he doesn't
have an account.
I screen 100% of new bugzilla reports and for those which I think need
attention (most), I will ensure that the appropriate parties get to see the
report.  I'll also verify that the "regression" state is correct and that
the provided info is sufficient-looking.  (It's amazing how many people
have trouble with the "Most recent kernel where this bug did not occur:"
question).
What I haven't been doing is ensuring that the Product and Component fields
are suitably set.  That's something which Natalie is now cleaning up.
