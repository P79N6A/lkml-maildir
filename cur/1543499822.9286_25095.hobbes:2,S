Emanuel,
I hope I did not create any misunderstanding with the recent emails I sent
about the code that I wrote. I just want to make it clear that my code is
mostly  an experimental / learning experience / hack job for me. It never
crossed my mind to submit this code for kernel or anything else. I believe
there are many experienced/professional driver writers out there who can do a
lot better job that I can. The code I wrote is mostly a personal hobby than
anything else and I don't mind sharing it with others who want to learn 1394 &
ohci. However, I would not mind seeing something out there (more official)
that will allow me to hook up my 1394 camera. Also, given the fact that I am
working on my graduate degree, traveling for work more than I should, managing
a full-time family with kids and trying to hold a full-time job... anything I
do on the side is extremely slow... However, I'll be more than happy to
contribute whatever I can to expedite the 1394 driver development for Linux and
I invite all others/new developers to do so. I assume Andreas Bombe is now the
point of contact for 1394 Linux project???
Regards,
Jeff Akgul -
