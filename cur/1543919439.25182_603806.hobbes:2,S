	Sure, but this can actually be a temporary thing inside the patch code (or at 
least static to that file if it's too big for the stack).
	struct paravirt_ops patch_template = { .pv_info = pv_info, .pv_cpu_ops = 
pv_cpu_ops, ... };
	Then you can even rename struct paravirt_ops to "struct patch_template" and 
we're well on the way to making this a generic function-call patching 
mechanism, rather than something paravirt-specific.
Hope that clarifies my thinking...
Rusty.
