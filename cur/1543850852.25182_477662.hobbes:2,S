Fair enough, I guess I don't, really...

Well, yes, but it would help some architectures.  It would seem  
rather stupid to build a hardware limitation into a 64+ cpu system  
such that it cannot initialize or reconfigure multiple pieces of  
hardware at once.  It also would help for more "mundane" systems such  
as my "Quad" G5 desktop which takes an appreciable time to probe all  
the various PCI, USB, SATA, and  Firewire devices in the system.
