Here's Adam's proposal for CONFIG_USB_HOTPLUG:
	
http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/2571/250/4599696/
From what I remember (and from looking at this message), all he seems to
want is to redefine the __init and __initdata macros depending on a
config item.  There's no other grander scheme of things, right Adam?
Although such a small memory savings for turning a bus whose main goal
in life is to enable hot plugged devices into a fixed connection doesn't
seem worth it.  
We are talking embedded USB hosts here, not devices.  USB devices
running Linux is a whole 'nother thing, which I'm just now starting to
look into...
Comments Adam?
thanks,
