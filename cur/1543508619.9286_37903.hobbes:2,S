Well if I can find my notes again are recreate lost code, I have kick the
darn things in to +33MB/sec.  64MB in 1.93 seconds was quick.  It is a
matter of finding that which is lost.
BTW, the Quantum KA has on 512K cache of which 371K is usable.  This is
different than the Dual processor core and 2MB cache of that version of
the Maxtor.
