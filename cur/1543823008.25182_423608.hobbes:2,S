Because it is the only video interface we have documentation for.
Almost all of the video hardware can run in non-VGA mode but we don't
have the docs to do this on NVidia/ATI.
It is also a universal interface supported by all video cards. You can
get things like GRUB and the BIOS up on it with minimal code that will
work on all video cards.
To get rid of it the video hardware manufacturers would have to come
together and define a new, open standard. That doesn't look likely to
happen so we are stuck with it. I do agree that it is extremely messy
to work with.
