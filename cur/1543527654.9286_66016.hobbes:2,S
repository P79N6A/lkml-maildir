Hi Whit,
I get exactly the same error. I'm speculating it's the checksum for the
boot-rom, but since it isn't there, it tries to be calculated, rather than
ignored.
Probably a simple issue to fix.
I'm beginning to wonder why the 3com NIC driver isn't being integrated into
the kernel. From what I've heard, it's significantly more efficient. Surely,
with the size user-base of linux, 3com and the kernel team would want it in
the kernel?
Cheers,
    Dan
