I know how and have done it.  Sadly I paid $350 for the knowledge and
signed an NDA.
One of the confusions that people run into when dealing with VideoCDs is
that there are two TOCs (Table of Contents) tables on a VideoCD.  One
is for use by computationally advantaged mechanisms, such as computers,
the other is for computational disadvantaged mechanisms such as VideoCD
players.
The former is a file system by any reasonable definition.

There is a book called the 'Green Book'.  It has all the answers in
it.  You can buy it from the Phillips/Sony consortium that owns the
technology, and from that you shouldn't have any troubles making
VideoCDs.  You might be more interested in the newer Super VCD standard.
Just use Google and look for 'VideoCD Green Book'.  There are other
books, such as the 'White Book' which would probably be helpful too.
Most of the VideoCD player software I have seen are what I would
call rippers.  They basically know how to find the mostly MPEG 1
compliant video stream on the VideoCD and suck it off, skipping the
TOCs all together.
