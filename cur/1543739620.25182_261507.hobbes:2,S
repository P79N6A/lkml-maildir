I am getting build problems - specifically with:
  CC [M]  drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.o
  CC [M]  fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.o
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:389: warning: type defaults to `int' in
declaration of `DECLARE_MUTEX_LOCKED'
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:389: warning: parameter names (without
types) in function declaration
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c: In function `heartbeat_free_smi':
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:393: error: `heartbeat_wait_lock'
undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:393: error: (Each undeclared identifier
is reported only once
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:393: error: for each function it appears
in.)
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c: In function `heartbeat_free_recv':
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:398: error: `heartbeat_wait_lock'
undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c: In function `ipmi_heartbeat':
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:476: error: `heartbeat_wait_lock'
undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c: At top level:
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.c:389: warning: `DECLARE_MUTEX_LOCKED'
declared `static' but never defined
If I read the patch correctly, this should be recoded as
  DECLARE_MUTEX
instead, but a quick grep of the source code indicates we have about
20 more places where DECLARE_MUTEX_LOCKED is still used. Should I do
a global replace on that or is something else needed?
I also had a compile failure in XFS. The messages are:
  CC [M]  fs/xfs/quota/xfs_dquot_item.o
  CC [M]  fs/xfs/quota/xfs_trans_dquot.o
fs/xfs/quota/xfs_dquot_item.c: In function `xfs_qm_dquot_logitem_pushbuf':
fs/xfs/quota/xfs_dquot_item.c:266: error: structure has no member named
`count'
fs/xfs/quota/xfs_dquot_item.c:279: error: structure has no member named
`count'
This refers to a macro defined at
fs/xfs/linux-2.6/sema.h:51:#define valusema(sp)
(atomic_read(&(sp)->count))
Not quite sure if this is an error due to type changes or yet another
name collision.
Please advise how to proceed.
