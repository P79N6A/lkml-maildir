Ok, this is strange, I put in an external 10/100 PRO S Adaptor, and im not
getting anymore eth0 timeouts, I would only get eth0 timeouts on the ONBOARD
nic if I enabled the lm80 sensor driver.. I don't know what to say, the
onboard nic would work fine without lm80 being loaded?
Is there some sort of race condition that the onboard 10/100 PRO is doing ?
I'm confused

-Related to i2c interface?
it could be that i2c is hooked up to the NIC for some management purpose --
maybe Scott knows.
