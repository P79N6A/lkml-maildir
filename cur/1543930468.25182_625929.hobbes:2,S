Well, no.  You're comparing apples and oranges here.  You can iterate
over 2**96 choices, but given that even if you are doing an iterative
guessing attack, you have 2**80 knowns, and 2**96 unknowns, it doesn't
buy you anything.  So saying that there is a successful attack with
O(2**96) simply isn't true!  Secondly, a 160-bit hash is actually only
80 bits strong (because of the birthday attack); when SHA was
originally published by the US government, it was designed to be
paired with the Clipper chip, which was an 80 bit symmetric key cipher
with a backdoor.

Yeah, but again, what does this "attack" buy you?  If you know the
output, and the current state of the pool, after doing 2**64
iterations you can get the state of the pool before the output.
Big-di-whoopdie-do.  You can't actually *do* anything with it.  
If you want to use that to obtain the unknown 80-bit output at that
point in time, you're back to the 96-bits unknown problem, since in
the case where you don't know the output, the shortcut attack doesn't
work.

Oh yes, I'm familiar with the paper; I wrote a rebuttal to it to LKML
at the time, and cc'ed the authors, who never got back to me.  I also
made a bunch of changes to strengthen /dev/random against some of
their observations that described weaknesses, even though I didn't and
still don't think you could leverage them into a practical attack,
even *if* you accept their premise of a state compromise that didn't
involve even worse consequences than enabling theoretical attacks
against /dev/random.

It's fixing a non-problem, but I don't think changing actually hurts
anything.  My preferred way of dealing with this problem is simply to
increase the output pool size, since that increases the number of bits
that change each time from 96 bits to 160 bits.
(This is a private paranoia patch I've been carrying around for a
while.)
