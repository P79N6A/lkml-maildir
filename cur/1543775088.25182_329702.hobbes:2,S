andi,
some hints for you.
when using Opteron 875, the problem was more easily catched. 
in smp_callin in smpboot.c
if change
Dprintk("CPU#%d (phys ID: %d) waiting for CALLOUT\n", cpuid, phys_id);
to 
printk("CPU#%d (phys ID: %d) waiting for CALLOUT\n", cpuid, phys_id);
will have 50% to pass through.
if change
Dprintk("CALLIN, before setup_local_APIC().\n");
to 
printk("CALLIN, before setup_local_APIC().\n");
will pass through every time.
