There are more than that, grep arch/*/include also.
In addition to mips, parisc, and x86, there is ia64, alpha, sh, and
sparc.

However this is handled, we don't want a rehash of the read/writes{b,w,l} fiasco.
Allowing drivers to do their own local implementations of these things
has always been a complete disaster. A Kconfig option will at least take
care of having these craptastic ifdef lists for architectures in every
driver that rolls its own implementation.
Even a sub-optimal asm-generic version would be preferable, if the
semantics are well enough defined and consistently adhered to.
