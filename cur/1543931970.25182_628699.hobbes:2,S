No, no errors reported.
I think I've been careful - I release the lock because we're doing
things like allocating memory and then sleeping on the queue.
But I also need to check various registers so that (a) we don't try to
do a second DMA until the hardware is ready and (b) we properly
serialize access to the device by two different threads of execution.
Seems to work.
Though I have an issue with the AICA driver: as it just locks out all
other DMA when doing its own DMA, it is causing the GD Rom driver to
miss some reads (as the interrupts are locked between the DMA being
requested and the interrupt returning afaics). It's not terminal by any
means, but it can be annoying!
