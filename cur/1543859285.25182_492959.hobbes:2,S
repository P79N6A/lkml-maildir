The system in question was built on a Knoppix release based on Debian
Potato, with updates from Woody. Most likely this is the package
nfs-kernel-server 1.0-2woody3 based on nfs-utils 1.0, which is the oldest
version still to be found on the Debian mirrors.
(argh, I should have saved the old binaries and [more important, since
the binaries have no version indication] package docs...)
