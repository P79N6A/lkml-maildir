Then add a small device layer for it.  Remember that linux is not all
about hacked up embedded devices that get shipped once and never
touched again.  If we put something in mainline we want proper layering,
and putting ioremap (which doesn't even exist on some architectures) into
a filesystem and having user remember memory addresses and pass them
to mount doesn't fit there.
