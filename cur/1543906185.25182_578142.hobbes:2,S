Oh dear :-) It was indeed my preception that yesterday you said:

( the underlined portion, in other words, is called 'starvation'.)
And again today, i clearly perceived you to say:

| Well, it magnifies the rounding problems in CFS.

But you are right, that must be my perception alone, you couldnt 
possibly have said any of that =B-)
Or are you perhaps one of those who claims that saying something 
analogous to sleeper starvation does not equal to talking about 'sleeper 
starvation' and saying something about 'rounding problems in CFS' does 
in no way mean you were talking about rounding errors? :-)
