If you turn on CONFIG_GART_IOMMU, it seems to force CONFIG_AGP as well, so
yes.  And yes, if I boot with agp-off, it works.

There's this little problem in that, to make things go wrong, I have to
fire up X.  That pretty well hoses the display, and an attempt to chvt back
to a regular console just hangs.  I guess I may have to dig in and try to
track this one down the hard way; wish I knew more about AGP hardware...
Thanks,
