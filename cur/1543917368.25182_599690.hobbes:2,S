IMHO this would be nicer if it could reuse existing sprintf code to  
handle all the nice shiny sprintf format specifiers.  The only  
challenge would be how to dynamically build a varargs list from an  
array of component names although perhaps there could be an internal  
__csprintf function which took a callback for retrieving arguments.   
Also since all of the path components are strings I don't know that  
numeric specifiers could be made useful, so perhaps it's not the  
greatest idea.
I think the primary importance for this functionality is:
