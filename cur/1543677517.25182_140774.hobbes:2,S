Too optimistic a description.
Any person who likes reliable results will give mount a -t option.
If someone likes to gamble, and doesnt mind system crashes, he'll
omit the -t and let mount guess what the type should have been.
Mount has a battery of heuristics for a handful of filesystems.
If any of these succeeds mount will try that type.
If none succeeds, mount will try consecutively all types listed
in /proc/filesystems for which no heuristic is present.
(Reality is more complicated, but the above is a good first
approximation.)
