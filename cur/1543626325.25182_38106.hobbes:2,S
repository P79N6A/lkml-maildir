Of course the basic answer is something like
  Try cscope
or
  cd /usr/src/linux
  grep -r "kstat.p" * | more
Using the latter one:
| 1. Why are kstat.pgpgin and kstat.pgpgout shifted right / halved?
I had wondered that also, so you made me look.
pgpgin and pgpgout are maintained (counted) in units of 512-byte
blocks but displayed in /proc/stat in 1 KB (KiB :) blocks by
shifting right by 1.
| 2. Are the "page" and "swap" numbers mutually exclusive? That is, if a

No, "page" and "swap" counts are not mutually exclusive.
Both paths call submit_bh().
For swap:
mm/page_io.c::rw_swap_page_base():
	/* reads or writes a swap page */
	kstat.pswpin++;
	kstat.pswpout++;
	calls brw_page();
		which calls submit_bh();
For all low-level block I/O:
drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c::ll_rw_block():
	/* low-level access to block devices */
	calls submit_bh();
drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c::submit_bh():
	count := is number of 512-byte blocks;
	kstat.pgpgout += count;
	kstat.pgpgin += count;
	calls generic_make_request();
