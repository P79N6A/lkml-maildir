howdy
when i try to compile 2.1.132 with the ac-3 patch (sorry in advance if 
this is off topic, couldn't find a seperate mailing list or anything for 
alan's patches), make bzImage seems to make it most of the way, until it 
suddenly dies horribly (no errors patching, i checked):
make[2]: Entering directory `/mnt/hdb2/linux-usr/src/linux/arch/i386/lib'
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/mnt/hdb2/linux-usr/src/linux/include -D__ASSEMBLY__  
-traditional -c checksum.S -o checksum.o
/tmp/cca09638: Assembler messages:
/tmp/cca09638:340: Error: invalid character '\' in second operand
make[2]: *** [checksum.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/mnt/hdb2/linux-usr/src/linux/arch/i386/lib'
make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/mnt/hdb2/linux-usr/src/linux/arch/i386/lib'
i've compiled plenty of kernels before with no problems... anyone know what 
could be causing this?
thanks in advance for your help
