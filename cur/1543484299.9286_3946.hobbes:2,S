Hi.
I've upgraded my machine from Linux 2.0.36 up to 2.2.1 and got one problem. Machine boots up and works really fine. But on rebooting it fully hangs and can be awaken only with reset button. I've tested several kernel and hardware configuration to find problem. This problem appears when i include aic7xxx into kernel.
To get the "clean experiment" i've removed all the rest from kernel (such as network support, IDE, etc...), all unneded hardware devices (such as two ethernet adapters, multiport-card, etc...) from machine and booted from floppy bootdisk with 2.2.1. Booted normally. On reboot with CtrlAltDel machine died. Finally, i've removed AHA-2940 from machine and booted from floppy again. Booted normally. Died on reboot with CAD.
This machine worked fine for a years under 2.0.36, 2.0.35 and earlier kernels.
Machine: motherboard ASUSTEK PCI/E-P54NP4, AHA-2940, Tridend video, Intel Pentium 120, 32RAM, 3.5" floppy (i've removed the rest devices and SIMMs to detect problem).
Can You recommend me what to do? I'm in serious trouble with it.
Thanks.
Alex.
