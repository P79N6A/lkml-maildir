Ok. I bet I've never seen it partly because I only use ssh (I don't even
allow rlogin to any of my machines). But you're right, rlogin certainly
not only uses OOB data, but uses SIGURG itself. I would actually expect 
that if we delay the SIGURG until after we've read the URG data, the child 
process that wants to actually read the URG data will trivially hang, 
waiting for it.
If this is easily repeatable for you, can you test just applying this
patch on top of plain -test9? It's not the patch I'd actually do in real 
life, but it's the minimal patch to verify that it's really SIGURG and 
urgent data that is the thing you see. Sounds very likely, but it would be 
good to really verify.
I think that this is, btw, the _right_ place for checking that SIGURG
anyway.
The case of being at urgent data really is a special case, and I think it
was a mistake to try to have the signal_pending() check in a common code
sequence - it's really two totally differenct cases when we check for
"should we stop here due to SIGURG handling", or "should we return because
we would have to wait for more data and we have a signal pending".
Yes, both cases test for "signal_pending(current)", but the SIGURG case
really could test for just "do we have SIGURG pending", not just "any
signal".
