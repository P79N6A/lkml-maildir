No, please don't do that I have no idea why people say that except for
drinking too much "small patches" koolaid.  Small patches are the
most optimal form if you can split patches logically.  There is absolutely
no point in splitting up a large driver into multiple patches.  It just
means you have to download and apply all of them to get the global picture
needed for a proper review again.  If a driver is too large for lkml a
pointer to a large patch is much much better for a proper review.
