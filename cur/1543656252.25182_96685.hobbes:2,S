Not masquerading, only NAT.
Everything works except outgoing file transmission, apparently caused by the
internal network IPs going out inside the packet (not the headers). So
unless the packets are modified on the fly, I don't think there's a chance
it can work :-) (unless of course they were originated with the public IP,
but trillian doesn't have the feature to edit that, and even if it did, it
doesn't solve the problem in the right place).
