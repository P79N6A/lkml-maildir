the main.c change was, frankly, trivially broken. The function that called
the unregister function already held the ide_lock. We have a debugging
mechanism to detect such bugs as they happen (the NMI watchdog), so it's
relatively straightforward (of course not easy) to extend the use of
ide_lock.
the more subtle cases are when the code somehow relies on cli()  
excluding multiple IRQ contexts and BH contexts for example.
