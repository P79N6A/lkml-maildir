We can, but how badly do we want to remove the old stat?
N.B. I've actually seen code that returns pointers to automatic
variables from functions and relies on the fact that they lie
beyond the part of the stack that normally gets polluted for
a while. Yes, it's broken - but the point of iBCS is to run
old *binary* applications. I'd rather keep stack smashing to
a mimimum. *Especially* the old stuff because they usually
come from programs that are no longer sold, maintained etc.
