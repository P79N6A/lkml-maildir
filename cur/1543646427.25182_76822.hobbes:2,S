Oh my, does this mean that if I use BitKeeper software, I am a 
participant in a conspiracy to restrain trade?
Consider: I make reiser4 available by bitkeeper.  Competitor of larry 
wants to use reiser4 but can't access it because access requires 
bitkeeper.  Larry has given me an incentive to participate in 
discriminating against his competitors (free license for bitkeeper).  Am 
I legally liable and subject to criminal charges if a Clinton judge gets 
the case?
