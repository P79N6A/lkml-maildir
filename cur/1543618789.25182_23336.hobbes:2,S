The NIC I was using was a NetGear Lite-On PNIC.  I swapped it out with
another one, and got exactly the same behavior.  Then I swapped in a
3C905B, and the problem disappeared; the network works fine.
Just out of curiosity, I tried another NIC, a Kington KNE100TX.  That
card didn't work at all, in fact, it somehow zapped my CMOS.  I went
back to the 3C905B.
After reading some more reports of problems with AMDs, I should also
mention that I'm using an AGP video card (an Asus GeForce3).  The card
itself isn't giving me trouble, and I've experienced none of the hangs
or Oopses that others have, but APIC issues do seem to manifest in
bizarre ways.

That's interesting.  Well, in that case, I can report that my Duron SMP
works pretty well.  The only problem I've encountered has been the
network problem with certain cards; everything else works a treat on the
2.4 series kernels.
Thanks for your help and advice,
