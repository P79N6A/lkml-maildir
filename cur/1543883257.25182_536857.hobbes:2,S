No, it just shows that bugzilla doesn't matter for most of the kernel.
Don't say that "bugzilla tells how bad we are at handling bugs". It tells 
how bad *bugzilla* is for handling bugs, nothing more.
Trying to play politics by pointing to bugzilla is pointless. Bugzilla is 
used for a few subsystems (ACPI seems to use it actively, for example), 
but I doubt most developers use it.
Would be be good to have a better bug-tracking setup? Yes. But I think it 
takes man-power, and it would take something *fundamentally* better than 
bugzilla.
Maybe the new "
http://kernelnewbies.org/known_regressions"
 thing will 
evolve to something worth tracking. Right now, bugzilla isn't it (although 
it can be a useful tracking place for individual bugs, *once* you've found 
and gotten the right developer involved - but that's a huge step that 
bugzilla generally does *not* do for us).
