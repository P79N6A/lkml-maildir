Via the even-less-of-an-excuse-than-you-thought department:
Many (most?) non-x86 handle PIO via special mappings and additional 
serialization instructions, but otherwise treat PIO register space in a 
very similar manner to MMIO.
Thus, it's /easier/ on non-x86 to ensure that PIO addresses never land 
at zero, because you must remap /anyway/.  It's only on x86 that PIO 
register spaces are accessed by vastly different CPU instructions.  Most 
other arches convert PIO accesses into massage+mmio R/W+massage.
On sparc64, for example, after I pointed this out to DaveM, he was able 
to implement the new iomap interface without the 'if (pio-mem-area)' 
branch present on x86.
