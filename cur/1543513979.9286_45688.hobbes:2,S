Hi,
great, with the latest 2.3.23 kernel I have about 2.2GB physical memory.
This is reported from top. Unfortunately I only have 80MB :-((
This is on a PowerMac 7200.
Another q, where there relevant changes to /dev/sttYx ? I can't execute
the following line: stty 57600 raw -echo crtscts < /dev/printerport (sym
link to /dev/ttyS1)
Thanks for any hints
Andreas
