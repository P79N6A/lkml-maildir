You can't have this flag in serio struct because unless this flag is
set you should not access serio struct in question, this is chicken
and egg problem. While you can somewhat control creation the deletion
is especially tricky. You need to service interrupts up until the
close is called but not a moment later as serio structure will be
freed by serio core. Therefore flag should be in the driver and having
code poking in the driver guts is not a giood idea.
start/stop are not mandatory methods so only problem drivers needs to
be adjusted.

No because (potentially) while kseriod is busy waiting on semaphore or
doing something else psmouse with synaptics touchpad can generate
rescan events at rate of 480 events/sec consuming memory for no good
reason.

Then you would have to have 2 separate paths for hardware cleanup on
unload and for cleanup on driver disconnect...
