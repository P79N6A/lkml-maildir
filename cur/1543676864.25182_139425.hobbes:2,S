Thanks! I'm still kind of groping my way through the code, fixing
these warnings as a motivator to keep me working my way through it.

I assume Linus has done this because the sparse library is still
a prototype, and the "check" binary is not really the intended end point
but just a simple front-end to invoke the library to test it.
I find it really easy to just over-ride this on the make command line:
	make CHECK=/dmo_local/BK_TREES/sparse_original/check C=1
This makes it easy for me to test different versions of the library as
I'm making modifications either to fix a problem, or to put debug statements
into the source code to undestand it.
Combine this with a good shell that supports history editing, and it's
not really a big problem.
