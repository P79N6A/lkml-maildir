Only people who try to build userspace programs against current

This is only a problem for people trying to build userspace programs
against current kernel header files.

See 2.
These three complaints seem to revolve around your attempt to use
the kernels header files for building user space programs against.
This is something which hasn't really been supported by the kernel
for many versions (since before 2.4) as you will find when searching
the LKML archives.
/usr/include/{asm,linux} are supposed to be a copy of the sanitised
kernel headers which were used *when glibc was built* (the words
between the '*' are the important ones here.)

This is a lilo bug - lilo is supposed to turn off the floppy motor before
calling the kernel; the kernel has dropped its work-around for this bug
and expects the boot loader to do it.
Alternatively, build a kernel with floppy support built in.

sysfs'ing subsystems is a complex task, one which requires very careful
analysis.  Don't expect ieee1394 to change overnight (or if it does,
expect your kernel to be unstable.)
