Anything, writing to a file, writing to shared memory, sending things
over the network.  There's no limit to what a filesystem daemon may
do.  It's a perfectly ordinary unprivileged userspace process.  And
this is a feature not a bug.

Limiting what a userspace filesystem can do would defeat the whole
purpose of the bloody thing.  This is not negotiable ;)
