Hans, 
Would it be possible to do something like: "pretend that there
are always 100 million inodes free", and then report sensible
numbers to "df -i"? 
There  is no installation program that will fail with: "Sorry, 
you only have 100 million inodes free, this program will need
132 million after installation", and it allows me a quick way 
of counting the number of actual files on the disk....
