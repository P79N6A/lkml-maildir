The biggest place where readahead helps is when there are several files being
read at the same time.  Without readahead the disk will seek from one file
to the next after having performed a 4k I/O.  With readahead, after performing
a (say) 128k I/O.  It really can make a 32x difference.
Readahead is brute force.  The anticipatory scheduler solves this in a
smarter way.
Yes, device readahead helps.  But I believe the caches are only 4-way
segmented or thereabouts, so it is easy to thrash them.  Let's test:
vmm:/mnt/hda6> dd if=/dev/zero of=file1 bs=1M count=100
100+0 records in
100+0 records out
vmm:/mnt/hda6> dd if=/dev/zero of=file2 bs=1M count=100
100+0 records in
100+0 records out

OK, so there's a 50% slowdown on a modern IDE disk from not using readahead.

So with eight files, it's a 300% drop from not using readahead.
With 16 files, readahead enabled:
cat file$i > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.01s system 0% cpu 9.887 total
cat file$i > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.01s system 0% cpu 10.925 total

cat file$i > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.01s system 0% cpu 12.262 total
....
Readahead disabled:
cat file$i > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.03s system 0% cpu 39.307 total
cat file$i > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.03s system 0% cpu 39.378 total
cat file$i > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.04s system 0% cpu 39.679 total

cat file$i > /dev/null  0.00s user 0.02s system 0% cpu 40.261 total
Still only 300%.  I'd expect to see much larger differences on some older
SCSI disks I have here.
