   They are not internal structures to your serial driver. They are internal
   structures to a pile of serial drivers.

   Then the drivers pick up all the other junk too. If you want to split 
   serial.h 3 ways according to whether an item is private to your driver,
   private to the kernel serial drivers or public to the whole kernel sure.
Making a new header file for 10 lines of common declarations seems a bit
silly, especially since there's no reason why those drivers have to use
the same internal structure.  
If that's all they really need out of serialP.h, then perhaps that 10
lines of code should just be included into that driver's .c file instead
of put in a public header file.  I'm *really* nervous about that, since
the whole point of serial.h versus serialP.h is to keep the documented
public interfaces separate from the internal private implementation
types and #define's.
But if 3 header files is the way Linus wants to go, that's fine.  We can
call it serialPstolen.h, I suppose, or something like that.  I think
it's silly though.  If they're going to steal code out of serial.c, they
can either #include serialP.h, or copy what they need out of serialP.h
to their own .c file.  Putting private declarations in the public
serial.h is Just Wrong.
Eventually, we can talk about ways of making the tty layer have more
support for this kind of thing, so that (for example) async_icounter is
in the struct tty, and the ioctl handling is done in tty_ioctl.c.  The
difference is, that would be a cleanly implemented change.  What we're
doing right now isn't clean at all.
