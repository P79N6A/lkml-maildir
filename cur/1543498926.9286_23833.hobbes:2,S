  I had that on from the beginning.  I can surf the internet from the Win98
client, I just can't get its broadcast packets forwarded onto the ethernet
(even when I reboot it to Linux, which isn't surprising since I blame the ppp
server).
kernel version was 2.2.4, is now 2.2.9.
command line looks something like this:
pppd 192.168.2.1:192.168.1.105 passive debug proxyarp nodetach connect chat -v -f /root/ppp/win98chat ms-dns 192.168.1.1 user saqqara name saqqara 115200 /dev/ttyS1
