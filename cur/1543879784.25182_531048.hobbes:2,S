This works fine on my DFI Lanparty UT nForce4 CK804 mainboard:
alistair@damocles:~$ dmesg | grep hpet
[   25.677099] hpet0: at MMIO 0xfefff000, IRQs 2, 8, 31
[   25.677102] hpet0: 3 32-bit timers, 25000000 Hz
[   25.678799] Time: hpet clocksource has been installed.
I've been wanting hpets for a while, this patch is extremely useful to me.
Unfortunately your patch does not seem to apply with standard tools, perhaps 
your mailer corrupted it (I just hand applied it).
Thanks Mikko.
