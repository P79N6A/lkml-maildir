I fully agree. However, I just gave away some ideas that I believe
they can make printk() easier and more understandable than it is right
now (for example, standardizing kprint_[registered,detected,...]
messages is something that I think it can simplify everyday use of
messages, both to people who has to code it, review/search the code
and people that reads the kernel output).

I got your point, and I agree. However, I also see the possibilities
that a change of the logging API can bring: If someday it gets
improved, maybe such day should be improved as far as possible. This
kind of stuff that affect so many things are not going to change for
long periods of time, as you said.
Still, I know some kind of changes can be really complex and maybe are
unproductive. I think the point is to get a middle point between new
complexity vs. new features.

Well, other improvements suggested are not just about internationalization.

I didn't talk about internationalization (in fact, I think it is going
to be pretty complex to get it right and, worse, to get it up-to-date
in each release without error in translations)

Take a look to other suggested changes, maybe you like some of them
and you will have found a reason to be enthusiastic :)
