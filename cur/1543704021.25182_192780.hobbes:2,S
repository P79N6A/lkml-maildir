Hmmm, I think that would be problematic. The throughput would probably 
be relatively OK (it's perfectly feasible to stash a load of packets 
into an mmapped area with zero copies and to have them all routed in 
userspace) but the latency is a different story. A router should be able 
to pass on packets with the lowest possible latency. I don't think it's 
feasible to schedule a userspace router process for every packet that 
comes in (they can currently do 435,000 packets per second on a P3-700), 
so that would have to be done in bulk, and that's a killer for your latency.
AFAICS the right solution would be to do it in the kernel and not to use 
C++ for it. It's a bit late for that now though. :)
