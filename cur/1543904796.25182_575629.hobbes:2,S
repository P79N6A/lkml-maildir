Can we do the port from ppc as follows:
- cp arch/ppc/syslib/*85xx*rio to arch/powerpc/syslib/fsl_rio.{c,h}  
make everything still build
- rename cleanup the code in fsl_rio.{c,h}
this makes it easier to see what changes actually are to fsl_rio.{c,h}

also you describe 7 items, was expect 7 patches :)
