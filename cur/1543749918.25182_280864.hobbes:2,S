Hi,
I am using an MX1-based board and would like to use one of its GPIO
pins for interrupt.  I tried to initlialize it in
arch/arm/mach-xxx/arch.c  by the __fixup function. Here's the part of
the code I added ...
#include <asm/arch/mx1board-gpio.h>
/* Configure interrupt setting, for bitnum of port configured as input.
 * */
void mx1board_init_gpio(void)
{
	int i,j;
	i=mx1_register_gpio(PORT_B,17,INPUT);
	j=mx1_gpio_config_intr(PORT_B,17,POSITIVE_LEVEL);
}  
void mx1board_init_devices(void)
{
	mx1board_init_gpio();
}
static void __init
mx1skx4043_fixup(struct machine_desc *desc, struct param_struct *unused,
		 char **cmdline, struct meminfo *mi)
{
	mx1board_init_devices();
}
MACHINE_START....
-------
I've generated a kernel image but it only goes until "Uncompressing linux..."
The kernel booted successfully when this part is not included yet.
Or maybe I am initializing the gpio in the wrong place or I forgot to
call an some function.  Is the kernel console already enabled by this
time so I can see the kernel messages?
Thanks in advance,
Mildred
