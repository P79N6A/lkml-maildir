-ENOMORETURKEY, so here goes with more resyncing, more backlogged fixes,
and some pending experimental bits that should end up Linuswards soon.
This is a fairly big merge, so it may take another release or two to
shake out any merge errors.
Patch against 2.5.1 vanilla is available from:
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/patches/2.5/patch-2.5.1-dj6.diff.bz2
Some of the fixes still haven't found their way back to Marcelo yet
but should show up in 2.4.18pre1 with any luck.
Enjoy,
