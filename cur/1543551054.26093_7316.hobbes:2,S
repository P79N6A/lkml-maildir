Same here, as I said it was next on my list.

Well, this explains why I didn't understand what you meant by "MP compliant".
LTT has no self-modifying code. Hence, there is no need to make special
cases for that.

That's fine by my book.

See below.

Yes I did get the announcement, though I was far too busy at the time to respond
anything meaningful more than: "Cool stuff" :) So I said to myself that
I'd take the time later to write something more intelligible ... I never got
to the later part ...

(I begin with a paragraph on the "philosophy" behind LTT and related trace
projects to make sure everyone is aware of those issues).
OK, I think there's a design issue that ought to be addressed right away.
LTT wasn't designed to help anyone delve into or debug kernel internals.
That was never a design goal and will not be for any foreseeable future. The
main purpose of LTT is to provide it's user with an accurate reconstruction
of the dynamic behavior of the system being observed. That said, LTT __can
also__ be used to understand kernel internals and track internal operations.
The generic hooking mechanism provided, the capability of creating new
trace points and the event-driven state machine engine are all part of
this "internals" functionality. Even though these are not an essential part
of LTT (the essential part being as discussed above), they do form a very
interesting development avenue and this is where I believe the projects I am
putting forward and Dprobes cross the same paths. In each, there's a desire
to empower __kernel developers__ or __kernel power users__ (if such a thing
exists) with the tools necessary to track and act upon the occurrence of
key events. Where the current LTT implementation of things only regards a
fixed set of key kernel events, Dprobes leaves definitions open to the
programer. I don't think that either is better than the other, I think
both serve their purpose. By providing a pre-defined set of key events,
LTT "defines" which events are interesting for system behavior reconstruction
and which aren't (notice that I speak of "system behavior" not "kernel behavior",
the former being the combined behavior of the kernel and the applications).
By providing a way to insert arbitrary probes, Dprobes enables system
developers to rapidly isolate different sort of bugs __without__ having
to modify the original source code.
So, my point is that although Dprobes can make a world of a difference
to help developers isolate bugs and fast, it cannot, by itself, serve as
the basis for the system behavior reconstruction infrastructure. For that,
and many other purposes, there must be a pre-defined set of key events.
An example of "other purposes" is using the pre-defined trace points to
implement C2 security in the kernel (this was suggested by Alan).
Hence, yes I can provide an interface from the kernel to log a trace event
with a variable length buffer, but I don't think that taking away the statically
defined trace points is the right thing to do. (I might have gotten this
completely wrong, though ... My presumption about your suggestion of using
Dprobes to "drive" LTT, is that you mean that all events should come from
Dprobes and Drpobes alone. I could be wrong).
So here's what I suggest:
There's already two event types within the events recognized by LTT which
had been planned for this type of usage. They are: "New event" and "Custom
event". The first is used to declare a new event type and the second is used
to log all such events. To declare a new event, the caller would call upon
an event ID creation function providing it with an event size. The function
would use the "New event" type to declare a new event in the log and would
return a unique event ID. Thereafter, the normal tracing function, already
available through the LTT kernel patch, could be used to log the new events.
This could be used by Dprobes to enable dynamically inserted probe points to
be logged within a normal trace and, thereafter, be part of trace analysis.
Does this fit your needs?
