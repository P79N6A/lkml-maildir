You're using PIII's, which don't mind the additional buslocked operation. 
P4's hate it.  We'd need to retest on big P4 and other architectures to
decide.
I suspect the spinlock is better that the rwlock overall - having multiple
CPUs looking up things in the same address_space is relatively uncommon. 
Having one CPU looking things up in one address space is very common, and
that's the thing which the s/rwlock/spinlock/ speeds up.
