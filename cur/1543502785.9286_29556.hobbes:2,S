Hi!
I've got 2.3.10 running on a PII. After a couple of hours of seemingly
problemless use (how dull:-) I find that most anything to do with the
file sytem results in the following:
% ls
Trace/BPT trap
% file *
Trace/BPT trap
% cd /usr/src/linux
% sh scripts/ver_linux
Trace/BPT trap
There doesn't seem to be anything in the console.
2.2.7 works fine on this machine.
Any ideas?
Luke Diamand
