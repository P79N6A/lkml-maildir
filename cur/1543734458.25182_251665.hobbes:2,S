Hi all!
I'm working on a security project, where we need to get full paths of 
accessed files. We are using the function d_path, and it works. Problem 
occurs if we call the function during a boot, this makes the kernel 
crash instantly.
Is there another way around the problem, or is there a way to check for 
some defines, so that d_path is not called until the datastructures are 
ready?
