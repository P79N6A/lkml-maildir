- Most of the string annotations are (naturally) dev{init,exit}
  annotations, and bugs there are therefore in configurations that have
  only extremely low testing coverage during -rc.
- I'm counting 22 annotations in the driver Maciej converted as an
  example. When estimating the number of possible annotations based
  on the number of C files in the kernel I'm getting a six digit
  number.
No matter how hard it would be to teach gcc about it, when thinking of 
the amount of __*init*/__*exit* bugs we already have I simply can't 
imagine the string annotations as a maintainable solution.
