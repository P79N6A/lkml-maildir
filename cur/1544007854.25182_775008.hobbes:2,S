This is noise. 0.05% cpu on a 1GHz machine servicing 1000 interrupt/sec 
boils down to 500 cycles/interrupt.  These changes shouldn't amount to 
so much (and I doubt you have 1000 interrupts/sec with a single disk)..
I'm sorry, but the whole effort is misguided, in my opinion.  If you 
want to optimize, try reducing the number of interrupts that occur 
rather than saving a few cycles in the interrupt path.

I have a truly marvellous patch that fixes the bug which this
