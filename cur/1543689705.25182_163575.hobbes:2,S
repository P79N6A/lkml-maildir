The hardware measures the PCI bus clock against its own sources and the
85 (0x55) is its timing measurement. The maximum range for the 33Mhz 
timings on the card is  < 0x55 so it decides your clock is outside the
safe range. HPT have never given us 40Mhz clock timings for the 372N or
as far as I can tell published them so we don't know how to drive it at
40Mhz just 33 and 66.
You could tweak the driver to accept 0x55 but either the card clock is
out or you are overclocking your IDE by doing that.
