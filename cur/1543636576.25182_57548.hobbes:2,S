The work for the mentioned NUMA items is quite active.  Some of
the pieces have already been submitted and others are near completion.
I would hope that the items mentioned by Martin make it into the 2.5
kernel.  The NUMA changes tend to be very easy to isolate such that 
they only affect kernels built with the appropriate NUMA config options.
From my list of NUMA items:
NUMA memory allocation
NUMA aware scheduler
Topology representation in kernel
Memory binding API
Per-zone swapd
Multipath support
Also, not NUMA specific but beneficial to databases (which tend to
run on NUMA platforms) is a fast user space gettimeofday capability.
This shows up in the AMD-64 port as vsyscalls.
