tnx - I'll look for that.

xAPIC != APIC
xAPIC ~= SAPIC
AFAICT, My x86 system uses an IO-xAPIC which programmed exactly like
the IO-SAPIC on IA64. i wrote the parisc IO-SAPIC support.
I haven't tried to reproduce the problem seen with IA64 on this box
and it's possible I just can't.

I agree - it shouldn't.

I'll work one out with Ivan K - he usually has good ideas.
