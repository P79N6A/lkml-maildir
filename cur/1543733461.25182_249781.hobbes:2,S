Hmm, ok. Surprising then. Can you profile it to see where 
the bottleneck exactly is?

Yes, but that's a general problem, not specific to compat ioctls.
So far nobody dared to drop the BKL for ioctls because it would
require to audit/fix a *lot* of code.
The idea of taking the BKL during the hash lookup was that
when the BKL is taken anyways it doesn't make too much 
difference to take it a little bit longer. But this assumed
that the hash lookup is fast. If it isn't maybe the hash
function should just be optimized a bit or the table increased.
Most of the values are known at compile time, so maybe
some perfect hash generator like gperf could be used to
generate a better hash?

It works fine as long as the compat function is in the same
module as the one providing the file_ops.

It may help your module, but won't solve the general problem shorter
term.
