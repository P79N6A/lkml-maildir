[1.] One line summary of the problem:
Computer freezes when writing to the log
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
I have a monochrome monitor and I use the mda drivers from Patrick J.
Caulfield (patrick@pandh.demon.co.uk, available from sunsite) to access
it. I use syslogd to also output all interesting information to this
monitor (in syslog.conf: *.*;mail.none;news.none         /dev/mono), so
I see all logentries in "real-time".
Since I have updated to the kernel 2.2, my system sometimes freezes:
Suddenly, without any obvious reason, I neither can move the mouse nor
switch to another console. My computer doesn't react on anything. Only a
complete reboot does help to revive my system. There is also nothing
unusual in my logs that could explain that behaviour.
But I noticed that each time the system freezes, a log-entry is
partially written to my monochrome monitor. The system only freezes
while syslog is telling me something. As the log entry is not complete
(and it doesn't show up in the logfiles after a reboot, as mentioned
above), I can only guess what it is, but it seems to me that it is a "--
MARK --" message that is written to the log every 20 minutes.
However I found out that I can trigger this error if x11amp is running
in that moment syslogd is making his entry, but my system also freezed
once when I pressed a key to deactivate DPMS.

freeze, syslog, syslogd, monochrome, mda, mono
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.2.4 (root@central) (gcc version egcs-2.91.60 19981201

[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information 
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
None.
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
Just run x11amp and wait.
