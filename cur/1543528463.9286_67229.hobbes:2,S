just wondering, could linux implement a 'hard' memory alloc policy? a la
solaris/Tru64/and probably many other unices.. ie when memory is
allocated to an app, it's /guaranteed/ to be there?
also, what is the difference between overcommit_memory set and not
set. I understand from the doc's that when set it's 'free love man' as
far as memory goes, but what are the restrictions put in place when ==
0?
regards,
Paul Jakma.
