I did not suggest or ask for that at all.
I was asking you to consider the real implementation details for a new
syscall mechanism.
We do not want to abandon the use of syscall/sysenter and go back to int
(on x86/x86-64).  This means that you have to come up with a mechanism
which hooks into the current syscall/sysenter path while preserving full
backward compatibility.
Now it's your turn.  How do you do this without additional costs?

Nothing at this scale is there in the moment, as far as I can see.  And
nothing so critical for getting right.
Talk is cheap.  You still haven't shown one bit if design how you want
to achieve your grand goal.  The time for hand-waiving is over.  Do some
work or step out of the way.  Nothing you have said so far in the least
convinces me and your arguments like "sys_indirect adds parameters" are
not really contested.  Yes, that's what sys_indirect does.  So what?  It
does this with almost no cost which outweighs the ugliness factor in my
book.
