I use cscope version 13.7 (on solaris 2.6)
the source file linux/fs/hpfs/super.c
from kernel version 2.4-test8 causes cscope to core dump during the database
generation phase.
the problem is the extremely long printk() string starting on line 280 in the
function static inline void hpfs_help(void){}
simply breaking up this printk up into several smaller printk's solves the
problem.
I guess this is only a problem if you use cscope, but I thought you all would
like to know..
