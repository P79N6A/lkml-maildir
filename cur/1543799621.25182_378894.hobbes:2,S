Dear Commonwealth Bank user
   We have added new security features to make NetBank safer than ever. Of course, security is an ongoing priority. So we've added some great new services to make NetBank safer than ever. Here are just some of the ways that NetBank protects your funds and personal information.
1. Personalised Identification Questions - extra for important transactions 
2. New Email Alerts and Bank Messages 
3. Additional Logins
In order to confirm your account and to preserve the account stability, you are required to login to your account using the following link below:

This procedure is performed one time only and it does not require further actions on the customer side. This is an automated message, no reply or confirmation is required. Thank you for using Commonwealth NetBank!
