I've never used BK, but I got the impression that it was all SCCS
under the covers, which means adding stuff and reconstructing random
versions is expensive (just as it is in CVS). The split between index
and data in Mercurial is intended to address that.

There aren't really any such rules here. While the index contains a
full DAG, the deltas are done opportunistically on a linearized
(topologically sorted) version of it. We try to make a delta against
the previous tip (regardless of whether or not it's the parent), and
if that is a win, we store it.

Well I originally set out to do it differently, but I decided my
current approach was the fastest route to something that actually
worked.
