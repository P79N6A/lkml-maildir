I played with your client/serv codes and, sure, a READ_SIZE of 15 is
much slower than one of 100, but I don't notice any stalls.  Running
strace with timestamps shows the alternating calls to select and read,
but the time between calls is only ever a few ms.
Here's the client-side timings for a range of sizes.  There's a nice
exponential decay in user and system times as the receive size goes up,
which makes sense.  Is this a case of "don't do that", or do you see
real stalls?
    size  10 0.69 user 24.78 system 0:25.48 elapsed 99% CPU
    size  20 0.33 user 12.34 system 0:12.69 elapsed 99% CPU
    size  30 0.22 user  8.13 system 0:08.36 elapsed 99% CPU
    size  40 0.15 user  6.11 system 0:06.29 elapsed 99% CPU
    size  50 0.11 user  2.38 system 0:02.76 elapsed 90% CPU
    size  60 0.15 user  1.25 system 0:02.30 elapsed 60% CPU
    size  70 0.12 user  1.36 system 0:02.30 elapsed 64% CPU
    size  80 0.13 user  0.85 system 0:02.30 elapsed 42% CPU
    size  90 0.14 user  0.86 system 0:02.30 elapsed 43% CPU
    size 100 0.02 user  0.66 system 0:02.30 elapsed 29% CPU
