I wouldn't be so pessimistic ;) The people involved should have a
shared interest in the feature so then they will fix it.
It might be nice for one person to enable their code on everyone's
builds, but it's kind of a selfish viewpoint (imagine if everyone
did it).

Ingo's setup does randconfigs I think? Then it should pick up this
option.

Ahh, you SGIers ;) Everything adds up, and 13k is a gold mine
for some people, especially considering how unintrusive the patch
is.

Well, because I don't perceive any benefit from doing that :)
In the end I don't want to make a big deal of it so long as it is
configurable. I'll resubmit the patch, and let others play with
Kconfig...
