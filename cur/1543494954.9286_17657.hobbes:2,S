Yes. My way of handling this will _always_ wake up everything that is not
marked exclusive, and that obviously very much includes select().

Well, it's even easier than the above. What you do is:
 - the wakeup-queue is a linked list (surprise, surprise, that's
   how it works already)
 - you add the "exclusive" entries to the end of the list (or at least
   after any oher non-exclusive ones: depending on how the list is
   organized one or the other may be the more efficient way to handle it).
   They are also marked some way - preferably just a bit in the task
   state. 
 - when you do a wakeup, you do exactly what you do now: walk the list,
   waking up each process. The ONLY difference is that if you find an
   exclusive process (easy to test for: you already look at the task state
   anyway) that you woke up, you stop early and go home. You mark the one
   you woke non-exclusive _or_ you make the exclusivity test also verify
   that the thing is not running, so two consecutive wakeup calls will
   always wake up two exclusive processes.
So:
 - nonexclusive waiters are always woken up. They are at the head of the
   list.
 - _one_ non-exclusive process is always woken up.

Indeed. That would be extremely stupid.
The more complex case is for things like "read()", where you _can_ make
use of the exclusive code if you want to (for things that have queue-like
behaviour and thus have a notion of an exclusive head-of-queue: pipes,
sockets, and some character devices), but you have to make sure that if
you don't empty the queue you do another "wakeup()" on the wait queue,
otherwise there might be another exclusive reader that doesn't wake up
when you stop reading.
For accept(), that's not even an issue, as you can just guarantee that if
you wake up and there's a socket to be accepted, you will accept it (so
you never have to wake up anybody else for the half-baked case). 
Note that the thing that makes this really safe is that you're guaranteed
that the _only_ things that change behaviour are the ones you expressly
asked to change. That was always a problem with "wake_up_one()", where it
had non-local changes to behaviour (a wake_up_one() would change how a
sleep somewhere else behaved).
