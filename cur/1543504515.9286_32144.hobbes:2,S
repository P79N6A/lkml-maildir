He maintains it? Fair enough then.

The original design is, yes, but then, that came from Microsoft, so
what can one expect. The Linux implementation isn't too bad in a lot
of ways, but there are a few tweaks that are needed to polish it up to
the professional standards that Linus generally requires.

True, but my response to the former is to ask why one should be forced
to run something like dosemu just for that one task, especially when
one can back up everything but the vfat partitions without doing so.
Best wishes from Riley.
