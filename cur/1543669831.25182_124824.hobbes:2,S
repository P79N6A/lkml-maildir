This is essentially what the Lustre Object Storage Target (OST) protocol
looks like.  The client talks to the OST with "object IDs" and does simple
create/destroy/getattr/setattr operations on the objid.
The data I/O protocol (bulk read/write) can do scatter/gather vector I/O
on one or more objects at a time using objid/offset/range triplets, and
the internal data representation is totally opaque to the client (i.e. no
block numbers are passed around in the API).
One thing that is totally missing from the Linux client-side is the ability
to use a "copy" syscall to copy objects directly between OSTs instead of
having to go through the client.

Yes, among other things.  We can do stacking of drivers (e.g. RAID, snapshot,
migration, read caching, etc) without having to change the protocol.
