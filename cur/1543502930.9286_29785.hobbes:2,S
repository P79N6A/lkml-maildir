This is just wrong. Adding necessary things in kernel will be MUCH better.
And if API and implementation will be sane enough I'm pretty sure Linus
will not object. Of course someone with enough respect must step up and
develop both parts: kernel changes and LinuxThreads changes...

In fact I'm seen patch half-year ago here to support HANDREDS OF THOUSANDS
processes in Linux (on IA32). The only remaining problem is that pid_t is
not big enough ! So clone() based threads are just fine IMHO.
