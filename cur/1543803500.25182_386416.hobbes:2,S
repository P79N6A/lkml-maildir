That's good; you've narrowed it down to the OHCI handoff.
Now try editing the quirk_usb_handoff_ohci() routine.  There's the section 
enclosed in "#ifndef __hppa__" and the two writel() calls after it.  Add 
printk statements to see which writes are taking place, try commenting out 
some of the writes -- in general, see what makes a difference.
Unfortunately I can't give you any detailed suggestions because I don't 
know how the hardware is supposed to work.
