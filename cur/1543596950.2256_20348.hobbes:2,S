The problem turned out to be KDE.  It opens/unlinks two files in /tmp
per terminal, and lseeks/writes terminal output to them continually.
With tmpfs/ramfs mounted on /tmp....

No.  Now, the pages go to the active list.  The solution is to not
use KDE-2.1's terminals if I fire up X ;-)  It doesn't livelock at
oom anymore though.. thrashes uncontrollably until sysrq-e fixes it's
attitude problem.
(I never saw this problem before because I rarely run X, and never do
anything which generates enough terminal output to oom the box if I do
run it.  I only ran the tar thing by chance, trying to figure out why
people were reporting updatedb causing massive swapping, when it didn't
do that here.. shrug)

No need.  What looked like a really weird kernel bug turned out to be
a userland bug triggering oom livelock bug.
