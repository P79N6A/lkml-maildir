Fix a race between rmdir and remount
When a cgroup is removed, it's unlinked from its parent's children
list, but not actually freed until the last dentry on it is released
(at which point cgrp->root->number_of_cgroups is decremented).
Currently rebind_subsystems checks for the top cgroup's child list
being empty in order to rebind subsystems into or out of a hierarchy -
this can result in the set of subsystems bound to a hierarchy being
different than the set of subsystems with state in the
removed-but-not-freed cgroup.
The simplest fix for this is to forbid remounts that change the set of
subsystems on a hierarchy that has removed-but-not-freed cgroups.
This bug can be reproduced via:
mkdir /mnt/cg
mount -t cgroup -o ns,freezer cgroup /mnt/cg
mkdir /mnt/cg/foo
sleep 1h < /mnt/cg/foo &
rmdir /mnt/cg/foo
mount -t cgroup -o remount,ns,devices,freezer cgroup /mnt/cg
kill $!
