Right now the way is, "Don't do it."  Write separate header files for
userspace.  See the lkml archives for details as to what the proposed
way to do this is, but I don't think anyone has started working on it
yet.
Either way, the kernel types better not be typedefs, end of story.

Just curious, what is your level of involvement in this project?  Are
you just merging other developer's patches, or are you writing any of
the changes yourself?  Isn't a maintainer of a kernel subsystem supposed
to be one of the primary developers?

Then you have a race condition in the above code that needs to be fixed.
And no, using an atomic_t is not the solution.
