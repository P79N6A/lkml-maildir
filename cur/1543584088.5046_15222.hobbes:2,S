This is simply not true.  I write to SCSI disk's block 0 all of the time
and never loose data.  Obviously, you can lose the partition information
if that is where it is kept.  I've also never had trouble with SCSI
disks correctly writing multiple sectors starting at block zero.  This
includes older Quantum drives.
