Having a framework for giving people the choice between different 
solutions usually sounds good in theory, but in practice there's the 
often underestimated high price of people using a different solution 
instead of reporting a problem with one solution or people adding 
features to only one of the solutions resulting in different solutions 
having different features and bugs instead of one solution with all 
features and bug fixes.
So you should give a good technical explanation why it's not technically 
possible or not desirable for one solution to work well for everyone.
