usb, but should be for all bus that accept a hot remove of the device...

So a diconnect when the device is removed and a released when the 
resource counter reach 0 ?

I am a little lasy to list all, but some drivers in driver/usb should 
have this problem : the first driver I look : ./misc/phidgetkit.c do 
[1]. So sysfs read don't check if to_usb_interface or usb_get_intfdata 
return NULL pointer...
And it is a bit your fault, as many developper should have read your 
great tutorial [2] ;)

I believe near all drivers that use sysfs via device_create_file, as I 
never see them use mutex in read/write in order to check there aren't in 
the same time in their disconnect that could free there private data 
when they do operation on it...
Couldn't be possible the make device_remove_file blocking until all the 
open file are closed ?
thanks,
