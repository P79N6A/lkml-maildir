Just got my machine out and booted up, this time I did enable my
chipset into 4x AGP, instead of 1x as last night:
alexh@lapper ~ $ dmesg | grep -i agp
Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
agpgart: Detected Intel i845 chipset
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 690M
agpgart: AGP aperture is 256M @ 0xa0000000
agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 00:00.0 into 4x mode
agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 01:00.0 into 4x mode
alexh@lapper ~ $
mvh,
