IMHO, I thought we had already gone down the *fd road with inotify,
posix message queue, and _hundred_ others file objects with poll methods.
I also think that inotify+(e)poll proves how well the fd/epoll model
fits together, scales, and that a new fancy event-delivery machinery is
not necessary. And it makes me wonder why I hadn't followed its "watch"
approach for futexes:
futex_init(); // Davide's anon fd
futex_add_watch(int fd, void *addr, int val, uint32_t mask);
futex_rm_watch(int fd, uint32_t wd);
Anyway, this unifying event machinery can be built, if needed, in user
space by libevent and others.
