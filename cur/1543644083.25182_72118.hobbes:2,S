I hope no one is going to run x86 boxes with 100,000 threads, but
its nice to know we can do it. (just to have an upper limit)
If they want 100k threads they should start thinking about a 64bit
box. Ive already tested 1 million kernel threads with 24GB and we
make machines with more than 10 times that memory... (and no I cant
think of any possible reason someone would want that many threads :)
