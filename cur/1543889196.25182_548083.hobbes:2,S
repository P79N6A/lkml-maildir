Hmm, on what does the async_ok depend? Is that a runtime check that is
done once or is it something more complicated like the availability of a
dma slot? If it is a simple runtime check then there should be a
operations structure that has indirect function pointers for the
different async_memset_{sync,async}() functions. Instead of doing the
async_ok check just call the function. That would save an if as well.
