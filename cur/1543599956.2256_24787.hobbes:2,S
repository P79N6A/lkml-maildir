Which compiler do you use?
gcc-2.95-1 is known to miscompile the current linux driver, and at least
one 2.95-2 prerelease snapshot.
egcs-1.1.2 and gcc-2.96-85 are ok.
I've just stress tested the driver from 2.4.9 - no problems at all. 9
MB/s receive, 7 MB/s send with Cyrix 6x68L 120MHz.
I have a workaround, but probably upgrading gcc is the better solution.
