BTW the access to sockets_in_use is not preempt safe. Although the data 
has only statistic value, it might be worth to fix this. The easiest 
solution might be to move socket allocation and the create call outside 
the net_family lock. The read lock should at least get a preempt enable/ 
disable (brlock might be another possibilty) and within this lock we can 
safely modify sockets_in_use and do something like net_family_get()/ 
net_family_put() similiar to get_fs_type().
bye, Roman
