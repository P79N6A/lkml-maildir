After a few hours my network doesn't work on my laptop. There appear a lot of 
those messages:
eth0: NULL pointer encountered in Rx ring, skipping
eth0: NULL pointer encountered in Rx ring, skipping

It works again after restarting network. I'm using 2.6.8-rc2 now. It was the 
same problem in 2.6.7, but I didn't test it with earlier kernels.
And right now I got one more eth0 message:
eth0: Too much work at interrupt, interrupt status = 0x00000031.
eth0: Too much work at interrupt, interrupt status = 0x00000001.
Here the messages after module loading:
eth0: SiS 900 Internal MII PHY transceiver found at address 1.
eth0: Using transceiver found at address 1 as default
eth0: SiS 900 PCI Fast Ethernet at 0xd000, IRQ 9, 00:a0:cf:c0:8a:dc.
eth0: Media Link On 100mbps full-duplex
eth0: Memory squeeze,deferring packet.
