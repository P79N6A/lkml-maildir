Basically, I'm using NFS and reiserfs. But I didn't use any file on NFS 
since the last reboot - and the NFS-shares haven't been mounted.
There are 2 IDE-Harddisks in this machine:
hda: WDC WD205AA, ATA DISK drive (40079088 sectors (20520 MB) w/2048KiB
				  cache, CHS=2494/255/63, UDMA(66))
hdb: WDC WD450AA-00BAA0, ATA DISK drive (87930864 sectors (45021 MB)
					w/2048KiB Cache,
					CHS=5473/255/63, UDMA(66))
On hda, I have got 7 partitions (plus one little "boot"-partition, which 
isn't mounted and a 200MB swap partition).
On hdb, I have got 12 partitions and one more, meanwhile 1GB swap partition.
All partitions are formated with reiserfs.

Andreas Hartmann
