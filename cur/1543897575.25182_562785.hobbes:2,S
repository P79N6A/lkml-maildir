Theres no reason you can't add the MAP_SPLIT_PAGES define in
all the necessary places too.

I have compiled the patch on m68knommu (after adding a MAP_SPLIT_PAGES
define). And it seems to work ok with simple testing.
I don't have a problem with the change, though please do add that
MAP_SPLIT_PAGES define in the appropriate mman.h includes. And like Paul
said there is no place for CONFIG_NP2 in it currently. Please take
that out.

Greg
