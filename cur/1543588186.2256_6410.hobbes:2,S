OK. I'll check again with 2.4.4-pre4+patches:
(1) Mounting the SuSE DVD-ROM (-t iso9660) from /dev/hdc on /dvd and 
    reading from /dvd works. Same for CD-ROMs. I don't have a formatted
    DVD-RAM.
(2) Reading with "dd if=/dev/hdc ..." 
   (2.1) works with CD-ROM inserted
   (2.2) fails with DVD-ROM inserted
   (2.3) fails with DVD-RAM inserted
(3) Writing with "dd of=/dev/hdc ..." works (with DVD-RAM inserted).
(4) "mke2fs -b 2048 /dev/hdc" fails (with DVD-RAM inserted).
As if the drive gives the driver wrong information (like size=0)?
If nothing helps, I have to plug the drive into a Windows machine
to make sure it really works with Toshiba's own drivers. This would
be a major hassle, though. No place for Windows on my own machine.
Hence some amount of screwing... :-(
