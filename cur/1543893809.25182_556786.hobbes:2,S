I think the reasoning here is to alert the administrator(s) to the possibility 
that somebody has just tried a fork-bomb. A better test, IMHO, would be to 
check how fast the processes are being spawned and whether a large percentage 
share the same parent. (Those two taken together would better spot most 
fork-bombs, including the very simple types that are just a simple one-liner)
