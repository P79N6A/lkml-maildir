	Uh...  Don't you mean "clock -w"?  On my RedHat system, "clock"
will read the PC clock chip and set the date and time to it.  That would
undo what you just did with the "rdate" command.  On the other hand,
"clock -w" will write the current system date and time to the PC clock
chip, synchronizing it to the time you just retrieved.
	BTW...  I prefer ntpdate and xntpd to maintain tight time
synchronization.  It's in the xntp package.

	With xntp, you don't need to run rdate each day and you are not
subjected to once per day timewarps when the time suddenly jumps from
what it was to what rdate sets it to.  Xntpd keeps the system in sync
by adjusting the clock and maintaining information on it's rate of drift.
This may not be so good if you are on a dialup system, however.  If you
are on a dedicated link, it works great.
