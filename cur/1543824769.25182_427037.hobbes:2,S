That's true even on x86.
Yes, this is understood - in this case he's following Nick's dubious lead
in leveraging our knowledge that no other code path will be attempting to
modify this page's flags at this time.  It's just been taken off the
freelist, it's not yet on the LRU and we own the only ref to it.
The only hole I was able to shoot in this is swsusp, which walks mem_map[]
fiddling with page flags.  But when it does this, only one CPU is running.
But I'm itching for an excuse to extirpate it all ;)
