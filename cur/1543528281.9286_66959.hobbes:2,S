I'm the one who reported the problem.  The PC in question has two different
ethernet cards.  The card in promiscuous mode on the busy network is an Intel
Etherexpress Pro 10/100.  The second card is an Intel 3c905.  I'll try
switching the interfaces soon to see if the problem is hardware dependent.
I should know in about 2 weeks :)
