Bjorn,
I like how pci_fixup_device() invokes the quirk
when we want at pci_enable_device() time w/o cluttering
the code with VIA specific hooks.
I think you've also identified an improvement by
checking acpi_irq_model -- as the PCI config space
IRQ register is defined only in PIC-mode -- so one
must assume that the quirky via HW can't depend on
us writing reserved bits for IRQs > 15.
But checking skip_ioapic_setup in the non-ACPI case
isn't quite right.  This is set for "noapic".  But
it is not set in the PIC-mode case where the kernel
supports IOAPIC but the hardware does not -- in that
case the quirk would erroneously exit.
Also, the original quirk_via_irqpic()
had a udelay(15) before the write -- I have no idea
if that was significant or not -- maybe soembody else
on the list does -- as none of us have VIA documentation...
thanks,
-Len
ps. we need to fix this on 2.4 also.
