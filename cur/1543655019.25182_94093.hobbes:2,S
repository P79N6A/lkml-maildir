Well, kernel objects may not be that small, but one would expect
the per-cpu parts of the kernel objects to be sometimes small, often down to
a couple of counters counting statistics.

Well, if you allocated 4-byte objects directly from the slab allocator,
you aren't guranteed to *not* share a cache line with another object
modified by a different cpu.

The reason is concern about per-cpu allocation for small per-CPU
parts (typically counters) of objects. If a driver has two counters
counting reads and writes, you don't want to eat up a whole cacheline
for them for each CPU per instance of the device.
