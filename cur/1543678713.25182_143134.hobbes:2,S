Are you talking about normal apm or acpi suspend or this swsusp thing?

Inclined to say "me too".

Admittedly I didn't care about swsusp so far. Given the big fat warning on 
top of Documentation/swsusp.txt I would not even try and i personally 
don't see what I would miss without swsusp.
But of course, if we can make all parties happy, why not.

I've tried to find some documentation about this - without success. So I 
have no idea why this might be needed and what it will do. Grepping for 
other kernel threads it looks like most of them use the same two lines.
OTOH the irda thread is very similar to keventd's workqueue which do not
use this. Not sure about the reason.
Well, I'm thinking about making the irda thread using workqueue anyway, in 
which case the issue would either disappear or get shifted to 
kernel/workqueue.c.
For the meantime, I think we should apply this if somebody would explain 
what's going on here.
