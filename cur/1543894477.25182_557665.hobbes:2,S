I claim the signature is derived from the GPLed bits, yes.  Whether
that's a derived work, in the legal sense, I'm not qualified to say.
And I claim that, in the case of TiVO, it is not only a functional
piece of the system that's derived from GPLed code and missing the
corresponding sources, but also it's being used to impose restrictions
on the exercise of the freedoms that the GPL is designed to protect.
And these conditions are what make it a bad thing, and that deviate,
if not from the legal conditions, at least from the spirit of the
license.
