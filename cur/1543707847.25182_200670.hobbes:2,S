Anyone happen to know of any legitimate reason not to reload %cs in
head.S?  I think the following would be a lot cleaner, as well as a
lot safer (the jump and indirect branch aren't guaranteed to have the
proper effects, although technically neither should be required due to
the %cr0 write):

I've been doing some cleanups in head.S after making the early page
tables dynamic.
