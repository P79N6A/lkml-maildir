This case is trivial, and both do exactly the same thing if you look at how
your if must be translated into assembly. What the kernel mostly does is:
  int f()
  {
      err = 0;
      do_something_hairy;
      
      if(err = broken()) 
         goto out_broken;
      
      maybe_this_works;
      if(it worked) {
         err = whatever;
         goto done;
      }
      
      some_more_hair;
      if(strange_stuff) {
         handle_it;
         if(err = won_do()) 
	    goto out_broken;
         do_more_stuff;
      }
      try_something_else;
      
  broken:
      do_cleanup;
  done:
      return err;
  }

egcs is certainly a lot smarter than gcc-2.7.2, but
a) Rewriting all that code means it has to be retested too. Lots of work
   for _very_ little gain.
b) Linus won't go for egcs, so the kernel has to be written with gcc-2.7.2
   as principle target
