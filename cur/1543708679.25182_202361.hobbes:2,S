Yes, there are ways of turning off a lot of this alignment padding and it
makes a significant different in code size.  You need to dig around in the
gcc documentation for the several -*align* options.
IIRC, not all of the padding could be turned off (the gcc options were not
complete) but it's a couple of years since I investigated this.
