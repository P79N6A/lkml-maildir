Yes this probably looks a little odd. This was setup this way for TIO. 
The macro in the TIO code checks to see
if it is a 'soft' struct or bridge address AND what bridge type it is - 
accessing different registers depending
on TIO or not TIO (the 2 cases we have so far). We think this makes the 
register access functions pretty flexible/generic.

OK - I'll look into getting this for you.
