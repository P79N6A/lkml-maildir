Dunno, twasn't there till I looked just now.  And it made it past that 
little roadblock ok.  Gonna be slow, logrotate & updatedb are running 
as its just past 4am local.  Like any good geek, I had to check my 
email when I got up to p. :-)
Yes, it built, and I'm rebooted to it.  Feels rather normal so far. A 
quick game of klondike lagged for the first 3 or 4 moves but smoothed 
right up.
Glitch reports as they develop of course.
Q:  Whats the diff between turning on hardirq's in mode 3, and mode 4?
