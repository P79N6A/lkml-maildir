Subject: assigning a line discipline to a serial device from inside the kernel

The Siemens Gigaset M101 driver (drivers/isdn/gigaset/ser_gigaset.ko)
is implemented as a serial line discipline N_GIGASET_M101, much like
the better-known N_SLIP and N_PPP LDs. It must therefore be "pushed"
onto a serial device in order to be used.
The classic approach is a trivial userspace daemon which opens the
device, sets the LD via ioctl(~,TIOCSETD,~), and must then sleep
indefinitely while keeping the device open, because closing it
would unload the LD.
Is there a clean and acceptable way to avoid this userspace daemon
and push the LD onto the serial device from within the kernel?
Thanks,
Tilman
