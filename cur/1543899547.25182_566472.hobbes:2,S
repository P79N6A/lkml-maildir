Sure.  I have some projects using autoconf only.  90% of the projects
use both though, autoconf-only is quite rare these days (used to be
different because autoconf was the first ...).

s/build/run/ time check IMHO.  Otherwise things blow up if the user
upgrades fc6 to 7 ...

/usr/share/man everythere, since years.  Maybe except Debian because
they first discuss 5 years how to handle that ;)

Sure, there are some things left you might want to check for even for
linux-only projects.  If it is only whenever some library is installed.
 autoconf will do that, sure.  It's still quite some overkill in many
cases IMHO.  On smaller projects the configure script can easily take
more than 80% of the tarball size ...
