Ok, this one boots fine again for me (didn't test the ones betwen my last
report and this one).
I have not yet tried to get this kernel to lock up yet, but i made another
interesting observation:
irq 8 at prio 98 (only irq 1 with higher prio 99). running rtc_wakeup in the
console (it runs SCHED_FIFO allright). Switching consoles (different text
consoles - not swithcing to X, though this basically produces similar
results) produces large jitters (around 1 ms) and occasional missed irq's
and piggy messages. This is completely reproducable here. The rtc histogram
doesn't show any large wakeup latencies.
/proc/latency_trace doesn't show that high latencies either on console
switch:

I sometimes do get large values in /proc/latency_trace, but they seem to be
unrelated to the console switching.
