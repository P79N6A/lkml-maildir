something bothers me here : with PC2100 RAM, you copy 1113 MB/s, that
is 1113 MB in + 1113 MB out !
I tried your code and code somewhat same results (dual xp1800+, pc2100, 760MPX).
but I pasted the no_prefetch_copy_page() function into it and now it says that I
copy 1455 MB/s ! I didn't look deep through the code, but I suspect that there's
some static work that is not accounted, or a subtract between two counters, or
something like that.
Cheers,
Willy
