Right now is the worst possible time in the kernel cycle to be raising
large many-file patches like this.  You need to either take a look at
what's coming in -mm or wait until all the git trees have merged up then do
the patch against -linus.
In this case there are mulitple new references to non-const file_operations
added to Linus's tree by alsa 48 hours ago.
