The further step after per-user resource limits is to have per-user RSS
dynamic limits. 
With per-user RSS dynamic limits you avoid memory starvation in a more
flexible way, instead hard memory limits per user. 
People already discussed dynamic RSS limits in the linux-mm list (Rik van
Riel has an idea of how to implement it).
Take a look at the archives.
