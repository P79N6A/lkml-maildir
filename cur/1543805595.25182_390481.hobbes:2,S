But why does A take the mutex in the first place? Presumably because it 
is about to execute a critical section. And also presumably, A will not 
release the mutex until it no longer has anything critical to do; 
certainly it could hold it longer if it needed to.
If A still needed the mutex, why release it and reacquire it, why not 
just hold onto it? The fact that it is being released is significant.

In the last RT work I did 12-13 years ago, there was only one high 
priority producer task and it was never allowed to block. The consumers 
just kept up as best they could (multi-proc machine of course). I've 
seldom seen a need for many priority levels. Probably not much you can 
generalzie from this though.
