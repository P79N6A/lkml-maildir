How about this?
brltty launches a child process that opens the VT and pipes data back
and forth to the parent process via pipes or fifos.
When the SAK is pressed, the child process will die, and the parent
process will simply relaunch it.
It seems like any solution that involves the kernel not killing brltty
will compromise the (admittedly rudimentary) security that the SAK
offers.
Hope this helps,
