<br>Hi,
<p>I wonder if it is feasible and practical to
<br>have a version of perl to be incorporated
<br>into Linux kernel. Either as a module or
<br>deeper than than, so that any perl code
<br>is automatically recognized without
<br>going thourgh perl compiler. Also, truly
<br>one perl core is uploaded and all other
<br>perl modules are loaded dynamically.
<br>(You can run many perl programs without
<br>loading the mem).
