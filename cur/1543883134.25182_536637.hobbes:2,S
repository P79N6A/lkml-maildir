Just copied to a tmpfs, and it still skips badly.
in response to your question, Ingo, yes, i see those atleast 0 ms
messages.
I am not running esd, i use alsa directly from ogg123.
but its not just ogg123, mplayer does it too. just moving a window can
trigger it. even scrolling in my maillist causes it.
and this ONLY happens on cfs, not vanilla, not staircase, not sd.
while i look at top, the load average is 0.11
its definetly not an IO issue, cause i just tried creating some IO load,
like reading files, it doesent skip, but moving windows triggers it
better than anything(mplayer seems more sensitive than ogg123), it seems
anything X-related makes it explode..
tried looking for buffer stuff in /proc/asound, couldnt find anything,
im using the via82xx driver.
