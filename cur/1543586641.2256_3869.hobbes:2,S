Hi,
in the old days you couldn't call a sleeping function in a module
before doing a MOD_INC or after doing a MOD_DEC.  Then some safety nets
were added that made these obsolete (in some number of places).  I was
told that people had decided to potentially get rid of all safety
nets.  Is this true?  Is it worthwhile to have a checker for these two
rules?
