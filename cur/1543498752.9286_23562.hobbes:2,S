When I said "module" in the above, it was specifically because the
discussion as to whether the said module is physically part of the
kernel or a userland daemon is unimportant. The important part, at
least IMHO, is that the messages need to be separated from the kernel
itself, and this separation needs to be done in a way that both allows
the messages to be internationalised, and also allows an error report
quoting an error message in one language to be easily understood by
somebody who is less than fluent in the quoted language.

That's essentially what I proposed the best part of a year ago, and
the voting was pretty much 97% against, 3% in favour...

Even in the kernel, no performance loss need occur if it's done
correctly, and as far as reporting errors is concerned, I have to
regard it as one area where quality is far more important than
quantity - a misleading or ambiguous error message is worse than no
error message at all in my experience.
The main objection to the idea of moving the translation entirely into
userland is concerned with the "fatal kernel oops", where the use of
any userland code is claimed to risk corruption of the file system.
My personal view on that point is that I can see nothing wrong with
the idea of splitting into two, with code to deal specifically with
suchlike messages included in the kernel, and code to deal with all
other messages in a userland daemon such as klogd or syslogd.
Best wishes from Riley.
