Right, I forgot that the PCI root driver is an ACPI driver.
This is a longer-term idea, but the way I'd like to solve this is
by converting ACPI drivers into PNP drivers.  Then the PNPACPI sort
would work for all of them.  PNP would provide a hook to retrieve
the ACPI handle corresponding to a PNP device.

I thought about that, but I didn't see a nice way to do it.  The
current namespace interfaces like acpi_get_devices() are walk-
oriented -- they call a callback function for every node that
meets some criteria.  Sorting requires some sort of buffer so
you can look at all the matching nodes before returning any of
them.
