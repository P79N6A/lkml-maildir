umount/mount is impractical when you're testing performance on a big
filesystem, which is always being used (e.g. /home).
I'm fairly sure that -o remount used to have this side effect, in fact
I used it quite a lot for that purpose, so it should be possible to
make it work again, or add a -o flushcache option.
