Hello
I have Nikon Coolpix 2000 digital camera which was working well on my
old Linux 2.6.? machine. After moving to a different one while the old
one is not accessible, where the new one has Linux version 2.6.13, I
found it doesn't work anymore. When compact flash is inside the camera,
camera turned on and connected, cat /dev/sda says no media found.  cat
/dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, /dev/sdd say no such file or directory.
If I take the compact flash card out and stick it into "roline 8in1 card
reader", it works perfectly. This reader puts the cards also as SCSI
disks on /dev/sda.../dev/sdd. Attaching the camera with CF inside to
Windows 2000 machine also works perfectly.
