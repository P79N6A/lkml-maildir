This is true, and I consider it a bug.  However the limit should be quite
high--either 256KB or 1MB or so.  So raising / eliminating the limit isn't
high on my priority list :-P  Please do let us know (me directly, or
webguy@theaimsgroup.com) if you find other mails that have been truncated
at shorter than this, I'll look into it.
Also, I'm interested in any corner cases where the attachment-parser messes
up--most of all when it fails to make attachments properly downloadable,
but also, to a lesser extent, any predictably readable mime-type, encoding,
etc which it currently doesn't try to print in-line, but could.

If I've got the right mail, you're after this one, correct?
