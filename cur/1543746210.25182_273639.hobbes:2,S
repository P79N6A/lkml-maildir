This is just the piece around it dealing with rss. The updating of rss
happens in the generic code. The change to that is trivial. I can repost
the whole shebang if you want.

If there are no page faults occurring anymore then we would not need to
get the lock. Q: Is it safe to assume that no faults occur
anymore at this point?

The page fault code only increments rss. For larger transactions that
increase / decrease rss significantly the page_table_lock is taken and
mm->rss is updated directly. So no
gross inaccuracies can result.
