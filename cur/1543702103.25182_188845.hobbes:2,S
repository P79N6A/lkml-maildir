hi
(sorry if this is a duplicate, but I did not find the archives
for this list)
I am using  2.6.0, for all my computers.
On my server, I have 2 net cards: one only for ADSL with PPPoE,
the other for the local network, and I use masquerading between the two.
Today I tried to set up NFS on the server, and  it does not work ok.
NFS seems to have no problems in writing large files, but it 
goes haywire when I start compiling the kernel on the NFS client
(the kernel is inside the NFS mount): on the client I see these messages 
 kernel: UDP: short packet: From 192.168.1.1:0 0/136 to 192.168.1.2:1
 kernel: UDP: short packet: From 192.168.1.1:8224 8224/128 to 192.168.1.2:8224
(many of these)
and even this very astounding message
 kernel: UDP: short packet: From 212.216.112.112:6299 33691/126 to 192.168.1.2:256
and NFS does not work; but I am pretty sure that the local net is OK
(I use it a lot )
I also tried to ping at the same time when I was experiencing
the problem, and ping works ok.
Am I the only one seeing this?
a.
