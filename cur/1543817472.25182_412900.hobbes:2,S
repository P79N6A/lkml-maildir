If I understand correctly:
splice is one fd in, one fd out
tee is one fd in, two fd out (and I'd assume the "one fd in" would always be
a pipe)
How about one fd in, N fd out? Do you then stack the tee calls using
temporary pipes?
i.e., if N=3, then we'd have:
pipe(fd_tmp_pipe);
tee(fd_in, fd_out1, fd_tmp_pipe[0];
tee(fd_tmp_pipe[1], fd_out2, fd_out3);
Basically, N-2 temporary pipes would be required.
Is this the intention?
Hua
