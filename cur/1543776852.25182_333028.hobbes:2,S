That's a very subjective viewpoint. Realize that this is a balancing
act between latency and overhead ... and you're firmly only looking
at one side of the argument, instead of taking a comprimise in the
middle ...
If I start arguing for 100HZ on the grounds that it's much more efficient,
will that make 250/300 look much better to you? ;-)
