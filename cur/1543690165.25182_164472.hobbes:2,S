Thanks Jes and Christoph for your comments. As you have noticed, 
this patch is not a workaround/hack for any C standard violation. 
We believe that we are trying to improve the code by localizing 
the compiler issues (including the ones for gcc3 and Intel complier)
and by introducing use of compiler intrinsics (e.g. for barrier()).

RELOC_HIDE is handling a specific gcc version behaviour. 
There was a discussion on this sometime back
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2002-01/msg00484.html
Richard Henderson mentioned that asm stmt is the only escape 
hitch for the current compiler behaviour. But as Linus suggested 
in the above mail thread, non-same-type cast(which is the current 
solution for Intel compiler) is the way to go for gcc also.
As far as barrier() is concerned, a cleaner approach would be  
a compiler-specific intrinsic(something like the one implemented by  
Intel compiler) that can tell the programmer's intention explicitly.
Once gcc has a cleaner solution for both these macros, we can 
do-away with these changes.
thanks,
suresh
