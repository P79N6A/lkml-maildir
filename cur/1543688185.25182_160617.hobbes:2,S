Last time I checked i810 audio did NOT work under 2.4. That is why I 
switched to ALSA. (The intel8x0 driver is perfectly stable for me)
IMO, OSS should be phased out quickly as it is wasting energy to 
maintain it. Those maintainers could be fixing the broken ALSA drivers 
instead of wasting their time trying to fix the broken OSS drivers.
ALSA should be included in 2.4 to help make the 2.4 to 2.6 hop easier.
Thoughts about this?
