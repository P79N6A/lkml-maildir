here is an opportunity to expose a sick muslim mind from Iraq to the
world, so why not do it... ah, I will press ^X to send and see what
happens :)
This reminds me of one thing a friend who attended English course in some
college told me. The students from Iraq, when asked "what is your name?",
"what is your mother's name?", "what is your occupation?" only took a deep
breath and shouted with all their might "Saddam Hussein!!!"...

Subject: VIRUS MAKER !
Hi
I am a linux user and programmer from iraq.
befor all , i am sorry for sending this letter using M$ Outlock because
my modem not compatible with LINUX .
I have an idea to make Linux the over Windows in the number of users.
How?
ok, tell me what will happen if there were a program called VM ( Virus
Maker ) or VB (Virus Builder) that work under Windows and DOS plateform
?
every child will be able to make his own virus by just giving the virus
name and check the destructive options he wants and virus type .... then
press Finish , Inject
the virus in any program he want and spread it ! it's easy just like
that.
after that, windows users will not be able to think that in just
switching off there computers , because every hour a new virus created
by an old man for a 6 years old child
and it could infect there computers. virus scaners will not be able to
think in producing 1 program because they can't make anew update every
30sec.
the software companys , will think 10 times befor building a new program
for windows.
windows users will be afraid from their systems.
finaly all the world will see one thing to chose , IT'S LINUX !!!!
by this way we can destroy Bill Gates in his home.
ALL THIS WILL BE TRUE IF WE BUILD THIS PROGRAM.
if you have any comments or suggestion about all i said then please
reply me. also i wish you can help us in this work, after all we do this
for LINUX.

him do it.
