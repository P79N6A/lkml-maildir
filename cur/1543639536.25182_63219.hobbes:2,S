Well, that's the point. Is it really "clearly"?
One alternative is to just instead remove it from the page cache, and add 
it to the swap cache directly (and unmapping it). In fact, I _think_ that 
is the right thing to do (yes, it only works if the page count is 2 (one 
for page cache, one for the VM mapping), but that's very different from 
breaking the COW and generating two separate pages.
The "move directly to swap cache" is nice in that it doesn't add any new
pages. But it's nasty in that it steals pages from the file cache, so that
it basically turns a potentially sharable cache into a private cache that
nobody else will see.
See? You actually _do_ have choices on what to do.
