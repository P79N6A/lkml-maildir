Playstation 2 has an incomplete toolchain (I tried to compile Linux 2.4.26
with the Playstation 2 drivers, but it failed on a lot if MIPS ASM code).
The patch I made is 184KB (gzipped) and is available at:
http://www.il.fontys.nl/~ed/linux-2.4.26-ps2.diff.gz
So if anyone would like to develop it a little further, do your thing ;-)
Gamecube doesn't have a rootfs (only NFS and ramdisk), so I guess distro's
for that machine won't show up soon ;-)
Yours,
