It's really for persistent threads, but you can use it as one-shot by
either (1) calling exit() in the core function (and noone calls
kthread_destroy), or (2) not having a core function and just having an
init function.  I used this in a test patch.
For #2, if you really can't wait for keventd, perhaps your own
workqueue is in order?

Yes: stopping threads manually is a real PITA, and things like
complete_and_exit() always make me wince.
Thanks,
Rusty.
