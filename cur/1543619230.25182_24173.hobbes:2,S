What about unmaintained parts?

That's what I have in mind. What we can already do now is to store
incoming patches into some directory. That would give us already some
basic data to work with and we can start to implement new features as they
are needed.

What "behavioral changes"? Maintainers should react in some way or another
react to patches no matter where come from.

Web interfaces can be nice, but the bulk work should be doable by mail.
For changes in areas which have a maintainer, the mail to Linus could
include a note "forwarded to maintainer x" and Linus can still decide,
whether he applies the patch or waits for the OK from the maintainer.

That's a known problem, I have no time either, but we should give anyone
interested in this some example data. This data has to come from the
kernel hackers, but patch management system is better implemented by
non-kernel hackers.
