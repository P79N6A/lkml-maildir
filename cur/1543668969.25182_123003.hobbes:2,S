How does this differ from fattach() in SuSv3
(
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/functions/fattach.html
)?
(i.e. does the fact that fattach() is defined only for streams
fds make a difference?)

It gets proposed every two years or so, it seems.
There may be some security issues.  Here are two posts that
might be of interest (I wouldn't know, I'm not a security guru):
