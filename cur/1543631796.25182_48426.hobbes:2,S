Larry, you've missed the entire point here. You can dismiss the RTAI crowd
all you want, but you can't take away the fact that developers are choosing
not to use Linux in the embedded field because of serious intellectual
property issues regarding its real-time capabilities. This matter goes
far beyond RTAI and would still apply even if you were to write a new rt
micro-kernel for Linux from scratch without starting from either RTAI or
RTLinux. Nothing you have said until now changes this fact.
