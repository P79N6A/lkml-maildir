« Should be easy » is easily said. Well.
The following patch to drivers/net/ne2k-pci.c in 2.6.8-rc1 happens to make
my pci ethernet card (Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8029(AS))
suspend to S4 and resume properly.
I know nothing on suspend/resume architecture, I know nothing on
programming ethernet card, I know nothing on patching device drivers; I
just looked at other drivers, picked function calls that had nice looking
names and put them together in ne2k_pci.c. Miraculously, it works.
Do you think it could get in ?
