I haven't added support for arbitrary callback functions. It is quite
possible to expand the interfaces to do so should someone need that
functionality, however my current needs only dictate that I be able to
grant the iosem token to a workqueue item, then schedule that work for
execution by keventd.
This is required in order to allow threads such as rpciod or keventd
itself (for which sleeping may cause deadlocks) to ask the iosem manager
code to simply queue the work that need to run once the iosem has been
granted. That work function is then, of course, responsible for
releasing the iosem when it is done.

Will do.
Cheers,
