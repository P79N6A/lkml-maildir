You gotta be kidding. I've not seen a single OS where
this cheapass chipset was fast. It's always the last in
line but maybe that's just because Realtek wrote the
drivers themselves. :)
3Com/Marvell and Broadcom are much better though and I
intend to try Intel, they are said to be the best.
Servus,
