Wait a second.  These messages would occur only if you had done a
read-only mount at 11:49:06.  Did you do a manual mount at that time?
Do you have one or more filesystems in your /etc/fstab (in particular
/dev/hda2) that are set to be mounted read-only?  That's the only
thing that would explain the "write access enabled during recovery of
readonly filesystem" warning message.  That message means that
/dev/hda2 was readonly because the mount command *requested* that it
be mounted read-only, not because of some error.  
The other strange thing from these syslog messages is that, (a) they
indicate that the filesystem wasn't checked by e2fsck before they were
mounted --- which is what I generally recommend: let e2fsck run the
journal take take care of the recovery, and (b) the reason why the
filesystem was marked as being "in error" is because the previous time
the filesystem was mounted, something reported an IO error.  That
could be a hardware problem, but it's also used as a generic error by
much of the exte filesystem code, so we really need the log entry,
which should have been the previous time this filesystem had been
mounted.
How is your system configured vis-a-vis the /etc/fstab entry for
/dev/hda2?
