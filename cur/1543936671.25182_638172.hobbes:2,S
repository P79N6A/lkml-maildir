Looks pretty good. Essentially the loop side is 100% the same, it just
offloads the extent ownership to the fs (where it belongs). So I like
it. Attaching a small cleanup/fixup patch for loop, don't think it needs
further explanations.
One suggestion - free_extent_map(), I would call that put_extent_map()
instead.
