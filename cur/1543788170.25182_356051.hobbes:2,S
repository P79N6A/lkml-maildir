  ahh, *sigh*, i remember the days.
  in 1989 i looked in /tmp on our sunos 4.1.3 server at
  imperial, which was running a bit slow, went "eek, that's
  a lot of files in /tmp" and did am rm -fr /tmp.
  a few minutes later the sysadmins quite literally stormed in.
  apparently the printer queue temp files were stored in /tmp and 100
  third year students were all trying to print out their course-work,
  last minute.
  oops.
  yes, imperial college third year theory of computing students of
  1987-1990, it was me.
