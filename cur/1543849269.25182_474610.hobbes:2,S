definitely CONFIG_SMP=y . The code block I quoted would disable the PIT
clocksource w/ more than one cpu. So the pit clocksource is just dead
weight on SMP systems. However, like Nick was saying it's possible to
boot CONFIG_SMP on a UP system, but removing the pit in that situation
may not hurt anything.
