Below is the complete information.
Its a IBM-DJNA-351520 13.5 GB HDD running on a ABIT BE-6 motherboard.
The kernel is 2.2.10 ( SuSE 6.2 ) with a patch for the ABIT BE-6 which Andre
Hedrik gave me when he came to Atlanta.
The primary master and secondary master have CDROM Drives on the
motherboard. ABIT BE-6 has a inbuilt UltraATA66 controller and my hdd is on
this. No distro at present recognises my hdd. Would any new distro be able
to solve this ?
HOw to I use my entire hdd ?

The ABIT version of the HPT366 sometimes needs help on getting the
geometry correct regardless.  This is an issue where you moved the drive
from the PIIX4 to HPT366 correct?
PIIX4 defaults to LBA
HPT366 defaults to CHS
This is a chipset issue not geometry solely.
Andries please ask me for clearification when people move a drive that was
setup by an onboard (normal) chipset (ata-33) to the (ata-66).
I am just now shaking down this issue.
Would you like a card mailed to you?
Offline me your address.
