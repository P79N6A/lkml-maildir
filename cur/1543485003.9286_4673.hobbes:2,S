Hi, gentlemen!
The gdth driver ver. 1.17 moves the boot hard drive with ID 0 to the end of
the found SCSI devices list. I did have Fujitsu MO drive, Pioneer CD-ROM and
IBM DGHS 18 Gbyte drive connected to the only channel of GDT6117RP adapter.
When using the version 1.16 driver (in 2.2.0-pre6-ac2) SCSI devices got
detected according to their SCSI IDs (HDD then MO drive, then CD-ROM) and my
HDD was /dev/sda. With 1.17 (in 2.2.1/2.2.1-ac5) the HDD has been moved to
the end of the list and /dev/sda has been assigned to the MO drive. I did
hook MO drive to another adapter which I do use only for a CD recorder and
was able to boot the system, but it's not the right thing to do. Now I have
the following on the GDT6117RP:
=== Cut ===

Can you explain why the HDD got last in the list? And why the CD-ROM is on
the channel 0 and HDD on channel 1? The controller itself has only one
channel...
And these are the boot messages from 2.2.0-pre6-ac2 which DOES work right:

=== Cut ===
Will it be fixed?
