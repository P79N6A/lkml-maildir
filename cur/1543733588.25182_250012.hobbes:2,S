good point. under my scheme you would need to access foo.txt/foo.txt or 
foo.txt/. instead of just foo.txt
I guess my way would work if there is a way to know that a file has been 
extended (or if you just make it a habit of opening the file/file instead 
of just file) but not for random additions of streams to otherwise normal 
files.
Oh well, it seemed like a easy fix (and turned out to be to easy to be 
practical)
