Just to add something to the noise, I'm so happy with DTLA-307030's
that I'm not even considering buying something different. As I see it,
there's simply no competing product, full stop.  Recently I've bought
a 41Gb 60GXP, and I'm happy with that too.  It is true that I usually
stick with the same HW for a long while, so maybe I'm just being lucky.
