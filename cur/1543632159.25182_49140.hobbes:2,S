Well it's obviously not.

Probably.  At least that often was necessary for most large features in the 
past... especially when those features weren't necessarily _interesting_ to 
Linus.

Sure.  But what if only Keith alone publicly praises the virtues of kb25?  
And if Linus on the other end doesn't care much?  And if nobody else is 
showing any interest?

Well that's exactly what I'm saying is happening. Interest seem pretty low 
unfortunately.  Otherwise more people would stop hacking for a minute and 
advocate a little for the inclusion of kb25.

Well given the current lack of interest (or let's say enthusiasm to be more 
correct) for kb25, why would Linus be bothered?  Since most people are 
indifferent at this point the burden is likely to remain in Keith's hands.
If that's not the case then let's go people and speak up, advocate for
patches in secondary trees, send your appreciation to Linus and lkml, but
don't stay still.  The preemptive kernel patch just to name that example 
got much more visibility, adoption and promotion than what kb25 had up to 
now.
Otherwise we'll continue fixing the current build system and forget about
kbuild25.
