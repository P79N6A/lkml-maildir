Hi Eric,
Can't we use the x86_64 relocation approach for i386 as well? I mean keep
the virtual address space fixed and updating the page tables. This would
help in the sense that you don't have to change gdb if somebody decides to
debug the relocated kernel.
Any such tool that retrieves the symbol virtual address from vmlinux will
be confused.
Thanks
