Excellent proposal, I think it should be implemented as-is.  I don't 
care that this proposal only works for "real" GPIOs, and doesn't provide 
for a userspace API.
At its worst, this proposal offers an intermediate step towards a 
framework that can do both synchronous/real and asynchronous GPIO 
control.  At its best, provides a starting point for that framework AND 
a much-needed unification in an API that could really use cleaning up 
TODAY.  No downside, in my opinion.
