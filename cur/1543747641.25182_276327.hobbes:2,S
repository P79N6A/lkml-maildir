I tend to think the other way around actually. For published (external)
APIs, contracts are far more important because you cannot review or test
the callers. For internal APIs, contracts can be more relaxed as you
usually have full control over the codebase. So no, I don't think
contracts are for internal use only.

And why not externally too? There are elements of a contract, I think.
The kernel, for example, dictates that you must invoke syscall A with a
pointer X pointing to an memory region of size E. Now, if the userland
follows that contract, it gets service; otherwise it won't. And as soon
as the userland _agrees_ with the contract, the kernel _must_ deliver
the service as specified by the contract.
Please note that the kernel may change the contract on its part any time
it wishes to do so. The userland can either accept the fact or reject it
and live without the service. And this is what you're essentially doing
right now. The only thing you're missing is actually _enforcing_ those
contracts.
But anyway, I think I'm twisting the original definition of Design by
Contract here for my own purposes and the only thing I violently
disagreed with you was the fact that you claimed Alexandre was making up
terms. ;)

Yeah, they've ruined it completely now. They're pushing Java right from
day one to youngsters :-)
