I am testing this code now.  This code appears to allow a long latency
path.  If you have 2 SCHED_FIFO tasks which are both ready to run and
the kernel is in this (long) free_inode loop, one task will get scheduled
and if it finishes quickly the other task will have to wait.
Could you explain again what the problem is when we always allow
schedule?
