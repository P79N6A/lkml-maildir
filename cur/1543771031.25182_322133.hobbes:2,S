This looks very interesting.  I need to read more into RTAI and friends
when I get a chance.  I just received the latest Linux Journal that has
the article about the use of RTLinux with the control of magnetic
bearings.  I've just started reading it so I don't know all the details
yet but it still looks very promising. 
I don't think the adding of preempt-RT patch to the kernel will hurt
anything. In fact I think it may even help out the RTAI and friends.
Anyway, as it has been stated, this discussion has started too early.
(Thanks Daniel ;-)
