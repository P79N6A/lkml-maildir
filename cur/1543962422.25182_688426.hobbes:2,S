When immediately closing a new bug with a comment only consisting of 
"Your hardware is seriously broken." it's borderline whether you can 
call this "communication" - especially if the hardware works under 
Windows or with a different driver.

And gave the bug reporter (who might have spent some time on writing a 
proper bug report) the clear impression his bug reports are unwanted.

He can ask for the output of "dmesg" and then reassign the bug to the 
correct people.
Different to immediately closing the bug with the comment
"Your hardware is seriously broken." this can result in the
bug actually being fixed.
