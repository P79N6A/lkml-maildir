These got sent to Andi as well, but the patches are independent of the
x86_64 conversion.
These are bugfixes (nohz-fix-nohz-x86-dyntick-idle-handling.patch) and
general improvements of the core code and the existing i386 code.
Can we please merge the above now ?
I can resend them or setup a git repo if you want.
Andi, any objections against the above i386 fixlets ?
Thanks,
	tglx
