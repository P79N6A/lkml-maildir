  I did not claim to have invented anything there, this is just a quite
 simple C code to execute instead of the current real mode assembly:
 it is a rewrite with obvious advantages/disadvantages.
 New features are more that this real-mode function can return an error
 to the bootloader to tell something to the user, so the user can select
 another kernel with the right processor, another video mode... with
 clean error messages - not a crash dump because this assembly
 instruction is not for that processor.
  I am still saying that the bootloader knows the root filesystem to
 be used by the kernel it loads, and that ELF is a clean format to
 store different sections to be loaded into memory at predefined
 addresses. Also there isn't any more kernel size limit.
 Etienne.
