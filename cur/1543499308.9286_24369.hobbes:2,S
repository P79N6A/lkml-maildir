   Ted now seems to be advocating something like devfs but mounted on
   /devices, and have a daemon like devfsd populate/depopulate /dev.
   And I suspect he's advocating having /devices be non-useful (i.e. to
   look quite different than a reasonable /dev), just for the sake of
   denying people the ability to mount re-badged-devfs onto /dev.
No, I'm advocating that device inodes in /devices have names which are
uniquely identify the device driver which registered the device plus the
location on the bus.  This is useful information which a user-mode
daemon would need.  If you make the names reflect a "reasonable" /dev,
it makes the job of the user mode daemon much more difficult.
