Hi,
I am testing 2.4.19-pre6aa1 for several days and today
I got the system totally freezed ; all I have is a
striped color screen, can not move mouse ; only thing
I could do is power off. This happened after about 8
hours ; just running Mozilla and just 15 minutes ago
the system began swapping. I check free and all swap
is used, then suddenly I got that screen. After power
off and on, I check messages and syslog, not any
usefull information.
(OOP or OOM or something similar I expect)
This symptom did not happen with 2.4.19-pre4-ac4  and
I remember I am rarely running out of swap.
This is a Intel celeron 400Mh, 128Mb RAM and 72Mb
swap. The kernel I said above is 2.4.19-pre6aa1  plus
ide-akpm.patch  
I notice that the aa kernel uses much more swap and
leave a lot of free RAM than the 2.4.19-pre4ac4
kernel. Responsiveness of both kernel are good even
when heavy swapping, but with aa kernel, swap is
easily running out while the 2.4.19-pre4ac4 not (even
run Mozilla, xmms, Star Office 5-2 and editting
document); but with aa only mozilla and running for
rather a long time should be enough)
