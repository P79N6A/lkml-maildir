Hi Alex,
What Riley said (Good job Mr. Williams).
lxdialog is an ncurses program, so if you have a problem with it, you
need to (1) check that you've re-built it, and (2) debug your ncurses
installation.
You can also pick up a static-linked lxdialog here:
    
ftp://ftp.shout.net/pub/users/mec/misc/lxdialog-static.21131
This lxdialog ought to work on any recent Linux kernel.
