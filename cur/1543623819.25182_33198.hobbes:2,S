Let's be clearer:
- If bitkeeper makes non-bitkeeper developers less effective than
  they traditionally have been then Larry gets to fix that.
- If non-bitkeeper users want *additional* functionality over what
  has traditionally been available then they get to implement it.
And Linus will keep pushing prepatches in the time-honoured
manner, so there's no loss in non-bk users effectiveness.

I don't think anyone has been criticising bk featureset or reliability.
A few performance mumblings, maybe. It seems to be a fantastic piece
of software.
But that's not the point!   Nobody, repeat nobody is happy with the
licensing thing.  For some people, the day-to-day benefits outweigh
the philosophical concerns.  For others they do not.  That is what is
being discussed here.
I see two things being discussed here:
1: I don't want bitkeeper use to *decrease* my ability to do Linux
   work.  Linus will continue to push patches at the same rate, so
   I have no problem.  I'm OK with others using bitkeeper.  EOT.
2: Kernel has a leading role in free software development. Other
   people do not want kernel's use of bitkeeper to weaken that
   movement.
   Me, I don't think the "movement" is weak enough for damage to
   come about.  And SCM is a space where the free tools are weak.  
   It's a once-off special-case and it's hard to see how anything
   bad will come about from it.

Well that would be icing on the cake.  But I don't believe it's
reasonable to expect bitmover to provide non-bitkeeper users
with *more* stuff than they have traditionally had.
That being said, the adoption of bitkeeper does reduce the
chances of non-bitkeeper users from ever getting more features,
but realistically, that would never have happened anyway.
And the non-bitkeeper users *do* have more than they used to
have - the web logs and changelogs.  That's nice.  It'd be
nicer if the web interface was more up-to-date, but I am told
that's a person thing, not a tool thing.
