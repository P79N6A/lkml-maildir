Actually it was in Nick's code (PUD layer ;-).  But I won't argue
that my code didn't have bugs too...

The problem is just that these walker macros when they
do all the lazy walking stuff will be quite complicated.
And I don't really want another uaccess.h-like macro mess.
Yes currently they look simple, but that will change.
Open coding is probably the smaller evil.
And they're really not changed that often.
