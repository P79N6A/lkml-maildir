Nice.  With this under control, another feature of his memory manager you 
could look at is the variable deactivation threshold, which makes a whole lot 
more sense now that the aging is linear.  To implement it efficiently 
PAGE_AGE_DECL just needs to be a variable, since in effect the deactivation 
threshold already is exactly PAGE_AGE_DECL.
How to set this variable is a deep and interesting question.  Matt had his 
ideas on that as you know, and in fact it's a key feature of the BSD 
mm it, but it's far from clear that the BSD arrangement could be used 
directly in Linux.  There are a number of obvious difficulties: no reverse 
map, highmem, more caches to balance, and so on.  However, it's intuitively 
clear that the mm sweet spot can be made bigger by controlling the DECL 
variable, i.e., we can push the thrash point further out for a wider variety 
of loads.
Obligatory disclaimer: there is no burning issue here; this is a 
*developmental* idea.
