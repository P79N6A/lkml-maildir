It's almost certain that you're not.
What's happening is that  when the ext2 code sees a request  for inode 0, it
freaks out, assumes  that there is filesystem corruption,  because it thinks
it's the only way you could have had a reference to inode 0.
Now that we have kernel NFS, the nfs code can try to stat inode 0 by mistake
and get ext2 to think something is  wrong with the FS, when it's really only
knfs that is confused.
