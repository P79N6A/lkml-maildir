Hi,
This is a series of patches for the iseries_veth driver. Most of these are
pretty much unchanged since I posted them earlier:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0506.3/1837.html
I've added patches to add sysfs support, and do some further code cleanups.
Please merge if they look ok.
cheers
