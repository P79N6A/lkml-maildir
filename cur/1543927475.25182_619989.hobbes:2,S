Basically, the only way to solve this problem 100% in userspace would
be with a userspace daemon running as a privileged user, and some kind
of Unix domain socket.
Patches to implement this in the e2fsprogs UUID library would be
greatfully accepted.

Well, it probably is less code, but keep in mind to really get things
right, you need to store the UUID counter on disk, so there is some
complexity which is needed in userspace anyway.
One bigger question which is why do you want to use time-based UUID's?
With the kernels random number generator, the random UUID's should be
quite good enough for your purposes.

Actually, these days e2fsprogs uses random-based UUID's.
