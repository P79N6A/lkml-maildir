You have made my points even clearer.
The fact that GPL_ONLY horse sh*t exists means there is a restriction on
usage.  So "GPL_ONLY" has in effect violated GPL, by imposing restrictions
of usage.  People will say that I am nuts and have spent to much time in
the disk drive layers and my brain has not stopped spinning to reconnect
to the stem.

Exactly!
I think it is about time to start 
http://www.ungpl.com/
 however that is a
gas and pipe line already, which gives a broader meaning to the what and
why many people have earned the title of "GPL NAZIS".
Yeah, I said it and it is flamebait.  I am pulling out some marshmellows
to cook as I wait for the roasting fireballs to come my way.
I am not here to make friends, just promote Linux for business and
commerial usage and the direction today is wrong period.  I will not
debate the point, this is my opinion and it is correct.
Cheers,
Andre
