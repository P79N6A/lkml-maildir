I really like this description, it's the most accurate description I ever
read of an -rc release. I wish you could convince Linus with it. 
The problem with -rc is that if we try to predict, it implies that we don't
expect to count much on user reports. Then why do an -rc at all if we don't
expect enough testings ?

That's always been my point, and one of the reasons why *some* of Alan's
kernels work well.

Perfectly true. I would add that with -rc releases, people only upgrade when
we tell them that they can, while with more frequent releases, they upgrade
when they *need* to, and can try several versions if the first one they pick
does not work.
