Linux on sparc64 does exactly that. Currently we just run 32bit userland
common between 32bit and 64bit SPARC CPUs, but the 64bit kernel is able to
run 64bit applications as well (first distributions with 64bit apps should
be coming soon though). Internally the kernel is 64bit, and for
32bit applications it translates the system calls arguments and structures
as appropriate. Take a look at how is it done in
arch/sparc64/kernel/{sys_sparc,ioctl}32.c
Cheers,
