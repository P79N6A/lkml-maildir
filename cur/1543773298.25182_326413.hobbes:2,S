Despite the fact that this wasn't documented in the BIOS update, an update for 
my board (MS-7030 Neo Platinum by MSI) supposedly fixing "Fan Function" 
actually corrects the IO-APIC and NMI bugs. I now get the following in dmesg 
instead:
Calibrating delay loop... 3973.12 BogoMIPS (lpj=1986560)
Mount-cache hash table entries: 256
CPU: L1 I Cache: 64K (64 bytes/line), D cache 64K (64 bytes/line)
CPU: L2 Cache: 512K (64 bytes/line)
CPU: AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3000+ stepping 00
Using local APIC timer interrupts.
Detected 12.561 MHz APIC timer.
testing NMI watchdog ... OK.
So I'm a happy man. Whether this is at all related to the problems I was 
having before, I don't really know. If the problem doesn't reoccur, I could 
very well have wasted your time.
