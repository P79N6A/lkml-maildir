Does the section name matter? I've been operating under the assumption
that it doesn't, other that needing to start with .note. Using
.note.vendor means that all the vendor's notes will get grouped
properly, but other than that it seems much of a muchness.

Well, passing the section name seems redundant unless its actually
needed. In this case it will go from .note.kernel-version to
.note.Linux, but it will end up being called .note in the final vdso
regardless.
