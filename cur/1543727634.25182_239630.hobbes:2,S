It's completely different, that you say so shows you don't understand
the issue at all. New devices work just fine even if the kernel doesn't
understand the pci id, as long as you can drive it from user space. If
you want a direct comparison, it would be comparable to disallow anyone
to use a pci id you did not know about at kernel compile time. So if you
get a new video card later on, it would not work properly until you got
a new kernel with that id included.
But thanks for high lighting why filtering is bad for new devices.
