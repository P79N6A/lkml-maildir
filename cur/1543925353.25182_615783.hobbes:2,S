James,
We are re-submitting those patches with the two patches (patch [2/8]--
"add module param fast_load" and patch [3/8] -- "add module param
max_sectors, cmd_per_lun" ) droped for now.  Later on we may implement
the module params as suggested by the community members.
Regards.
Bo Yang

Yes, it would have to be exported and moved to a public header.

Your implementation adds state to scanning that could easily break and
makes the driver complex for things that don't belong into a driver, so
there's a clear NACK for this from me.
