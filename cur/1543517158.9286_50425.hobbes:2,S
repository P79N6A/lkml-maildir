Hi Brian!
I have an SonicVibes card as well, with the same problem. From what I
gathered from the list S3 doesn't support the Linux driver in any way.
The problem you see is that the chip locks up. I cannot provide a
solution for that, but let me point out that the ALSA project has a
driver for the SonicVibes card, too. It also locks up, but unlike the
kernel driver reloading the module will make the sound-card work again.
Maybe this will help you.
Walter
