No, it is what it says, AFAIK.
read/write/whatever system call tries to access past end of device 
although it isn't asked to (or the problem is somewhere deeper). This 
has happened to me on swap partition which had fairly dramatic effect. 
;-) Not using last few blocks solved the problem. Of course, this 
shouldn't be the case...
