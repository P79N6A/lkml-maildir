This patch is still wrong.
It seems my comment on this [1] was lost:
<--  snip  -->
This line has to be something like
( (__GNUC__ == 3 && __GNUC_MINOR__ == 3 && __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ >= 4) && \
   HEAVILY_PATCHED_SUSE_GCC ) 
I hope SuSE has added some #define to distinguish what they call 
"gcc 3.3.4" from GNU gcc 3.3.4
<--  snip  -->
