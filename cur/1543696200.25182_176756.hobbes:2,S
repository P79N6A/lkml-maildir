Ok, then it is Nick's turn, I guess. :-) Yeah most probably the iso is 
cached, as it was not the first time I burnt the iso when I did the 
vmstat, furthermore I have 1 GB of RAM... The other thing which doesn't 
speack for i/o problems, I guess: Just the first seconds when I start 
erasing the CD-RW the mouse hangs and heavily stutters, then it is OK 
until actual burning of image begins, then the mouse slightly stutters. 
All this was not with test9-mm1.
