The RFC?  Well, it does have a "RESOURCE" error that the server can
return for overly complicated compounds.  It doesn't give much guidance
on when exactly that could happen, but if there's ever a clear case for
returning NFS4ERR_RESOURCE, I think it must be the case of a client
trying to circumvent the maximum read/write size by using multiple read
or write operations in a single compound.
(We have some other odd restrictions on the sorts of compounds we can
accept, which I'd like to relax.  But that's a problem for another day.)

There's also the check at the end of svc_tcp_recvfrom():
	if (svsk->sk_reclen > serv->sv_bufsz) {
		printk(KERN_NOTICE "RPC: bad TCP reclen 0x%08lx (large)\n",
		       (unsigned long) svsk->sk_reclen);
		goto err_delete;
	}
--b.
