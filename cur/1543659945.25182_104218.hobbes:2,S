IMO this link order business is a problem that's existed for ages,
it's unrelated to the device model, and adding seven levels of
initcalls merely hid this problem a little bit.
Back when I was doing fbdev stuff, I just gave up and did things "the
old way", a la
	#ifdef MODULE
	module_init(my_driver);
	#endif
and then call my_driver from other code, when it is built into the
kernel, overriding link order.
Not a great solution, I know.  My preferred solution has always been to
explicitly list the dependencies, so a build-time tool can figure out
the link order automagically.
