kernel code is, as userspace one, just a code to be executed by the CPU,
I suspect you knew that already ;) Therefore, it can do absolutely
anything the human tells it to. Even calling "libc functions" as long as
you implement the desired libc functionality in the kernel yourself - most
of what is needed is there already, e.g. sprintf() etc.
Having said that, doing things like opening files and sockets is usually
frowned upon and rightly so, except in special cases like khttpd and such.

some other way may be by means of system calls. System calls are the most
natural (by definition) way of communicating between userspace and kernel.
