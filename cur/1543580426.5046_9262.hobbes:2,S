I built a embedded dvd/cdda/mp3 player based on linux, using a p200mmx
with 24mb with a bus of 75mhx, but it still takes about 20 seconds to boot,
I think that an embedded device (for home use) should boot in less than
5 seconds, how could be possible with a slow p133? (I've also tried a p133
on 66mhz of bus and it takes almost 35 seconds to boot)
However, first or last old hardware will finish, and who wants to build
an embedded device should use high cost embedded hardware (high cost for me).
