Well, the only thing that changes the sata_mv driver in the -mm1 patchset 
is the "git-libata-all.patch" patch, so you might start out just applying 
that one broken-out patch and verifying that it fixes things for you.
That's git commit 2086a4aa2b41846801fad01f0fb1723134865ebb from Jeff's 
libata tree.
At that point, if that fixes it for you, you'd be best off bisecting it in 
Jeff's libata tree using git, to figure out what it is that fixed things. 
Jeff?
