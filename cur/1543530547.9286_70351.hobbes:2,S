pre2-3 defines MADV_SPACEAVAIL in asm-alpha/mman.h and MADV_FREE in
asm-sparc/mman.h.
These defines are not used anywhere else in the kernel - and therefore
the madvise function will return EINVAL for these defines.
Is this really desired?  
Btw. there's so far only madvise defined for alpha, i386 and sparc.  I
hope the other architectures will come soon.
