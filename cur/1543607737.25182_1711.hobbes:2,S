Well, it shouldn't be too hard to modify the bonding driver to do something
like this (?), and instead the most work should (and will) go into the
user-space daemon. That way it would be possible not only to detect faulty
NIC hardware, but also to detect for example a faulty network segment.
Anyone wants to take a shot on this? I'm gonna look into it a bit, because
it sounds like a nice project for me as a linux-kernel-programmer newbie.
