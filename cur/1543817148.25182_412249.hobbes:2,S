My mistake, I looked at a different spot. Fixed.

I can go either way, I tend to agree that passing in offset may be the
best solution.

Will fix that up.

It doesn't, I'm assuming that find_get_pages() returns consequtive pages
atm. Would seem like the sane interface :-)
We continue doing find_or_create_page() on the remaining, but using 'i'
as the 'index' addition. So if we had non-conseq pages, we'd be screwed.
Needs a little thinking, input welcome..
