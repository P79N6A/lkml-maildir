New files:
kbuild-2.5-core-18
  Change from core-17.
    Add a missing case for dependency standardization.
kbuild-2.5-common-2.4.18-8
kbuild-2.5-i386-2.4.18-3
    Synchronize link order method with 2.5.20, so both 2.4 and 2.5
    versions of kbuild 2.5 use the same process.
kbuild-2.5-common-2.4.19-pre10-1
kbuild-2.5-i386-2.4.19-pre10-1
    Upgrade to 2.4.19-pre10.  Also has new link order method.
