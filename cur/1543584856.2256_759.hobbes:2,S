Well, I can't speak for the consequences of noapic (I've wondered as
much myself), but I know that there's been a problem with SMP 2.4
kernels (even the 2.4 test kernels) and USB running on VIA chipsets for
a while now.  I'm told by the linux-usb maintainers that it's a problem
with the PCI IRQ routing for the VIA chipsets, but I've been unable to
get anyone who knows about this to do anything (and I've been asking for
a while).  Alas, since this stuff is beyond me, I just accept the fact
that it'll probably always be broke.
