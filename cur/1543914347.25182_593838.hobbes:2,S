Not sure I understand what this has to do with things... is this an
unrelated fix?

This is rather awful -- another call to get_user_pages() to iterate
over all the vmas...
I would suggest extending ib_umem_get() to check the vmas and adding a
member to struct ib_umem to say whether the memory is entirely covered
by hugetlb pages or not.

It seems like it would be better to just assume the memory is not from
a hugetlb is ehca_is_mem_hugetlb() fails its memory allocation and
fall back to the PAGE_SIZE case rather than failing entirely.
Also if someone runs a kernel with 64K pages on a machine where they
end up being simulated from 4K pages, do you have the same issue with
the hypervisor ganging together non-contiguous pages?
