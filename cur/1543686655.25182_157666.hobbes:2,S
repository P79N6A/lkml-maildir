Well, all keyboards but PS/2 are able to report (or keep track) of the
state quite well, and regarding PS/2 only buggy keyboards that deviate
from the basic rules of sanity are a problem.

It is not. There is only ONE key that is not repeated on normal PS/2
keyboards and that is the Pause key. All other keys (including shift,
etc) are repeated. The Pause key, though, sends both Down and Up events
on the keypress, so it doesn't confuse the software.

The best is never possible.

Ok.

Won't work on keyboards which send more than one DOWN before an UP.
There are a bunch of these, notably the broken notebook keyboards.

That's what I'm planning to implement, with the timeout being the
hardware autorepeat delay. This way the sw autorepeat never kicks in
unless the hardware one does, too. On the PS/2 keyboards only.

Fn+F1 won't most likely generate a keypress event. It'll just change the
contrast via the BIOS or something.
I really believe that keys which generate the same scancode when pressed
and released (as per the report which started the thread) usually happen
because the keyboard is in some non-native mode.
I have keyboards which report the same scancode for both press and
release of several keys (making the keys undistinguishable) unless
switched to scancode set 3.
