No, I didn't compare yet, but I could not find any definition on that. It
really seems to be a "grey area".

This patch should also work on 2.4 and looks good to me, if "ready" should
be returned instead of EBADF. I don't think this would break existing
apps. Without such a patch, the app would sleep forever unless a signal
arrives. If any app depends on that behavior, I think it is bad coded.
