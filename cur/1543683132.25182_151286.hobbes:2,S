Hi,
A few weeks ago Andrew Miklas wrote about a potential GPL violation
with the Linksys WRT54G wireless access point. I may have something
that falls into the same category, namely the Nokia A036.
Nokia A036 is a 802.11b access point, small in size and with some
nice features. Besides using a web interface it's possible to
telnet into the device to configure it. Here's a sample session:
LocalAP login: root
Password: 
#
# uname -a
Linux LocalAP 2.4.17-uc0 #17 Tue Nov 5 20:12:26 CST 2002 armv4l unknown
# grep -v
BusyBox v0.51 (2002.11.05-12:11+0000) multi-call binary
Usage: grep [-ihHnqvs] pattern [files...]
# cat /proc/cpuinfo
Processor       : ARM Arm940 rev 1 (v4l)
BogoMIPS        : 89.49
Hardware        : POLDHU
Revision        : 0000
Serial          : 0000000000000000
# cat /proc/version
Linux version 2.4.17-uc0 (root@guava-004.gemtek.com.tw) (gcc version 2.95.3.2 20010315 (release)) #17 Tue Nov 5 20:12:26 CST 2002
So, it's quite clear that this access point runs Linux and BusyBox.
It does not use modules - the kernel seems to be static. Therefore
I must assume that the drivers for the wireless interface are
free software too.
I have the factory package and product CD for the A036, but there's
no sign of the GNU GPL anywhere - or pointers where to get the
source code - just the normal Nokia copyright texts and disclaimers.
Having the source code would be useful in learning how this device
works. It might also be handy for customizing this device. 
How should I (and the Linux community) proceed to solve this problem?
Perhaps someone at Nokia is reading this?
Regards,
Tomi Lapinlampi
