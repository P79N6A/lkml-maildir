Hi,
My question is: Is there someone working on real device driver support for
Linux i.e. separated from the kernel ? Is there a mailing list on this
topic, or has an important decision been taken on this in the past ? 
If not, is anyone willing to discuss things with me on this subject ?
Maybe we can come towards a proposal to implement it.
Jos
