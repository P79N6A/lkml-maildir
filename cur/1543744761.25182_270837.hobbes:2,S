This is very, very wrong.  You are essentially creating in in-driver 
/dev/null simulator.  This does nothing but chew CPU cycles by having 
the driver drop packets, rather than allowing the system to work as it 
should.
Queues are DESIGNED to fill up under various conditions.
Would not the zebra routing software have the same problems with cable 
pull under an e1000 or tg3 gigabit NIC?

Which drivers, specifically, are these?
The most popular drivers -- e1000, tg3, etc. -- do not do this, for very 
good reasons.
