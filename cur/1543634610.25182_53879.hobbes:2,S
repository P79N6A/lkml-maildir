Always interesting, and if there's nothing clashing of more interest
to me, count me in.

Some crossover with my talk at OLS here. As we've until wednesday, if
this is the route you decide to take, let me know, and we'll compare
slides etc to make sure we're not repeating.. I'll also be happy to 
help out here if need be.

Probably lots of crossover with Val Hensons talk, but probably still
worthwhile.

Again, probably a good talk but covered (in part) by my talk, and
possibly by Val's.  I've no doubt that we'll all meet up between now and
Wednesday at some point, and have lots to discuss, and hopefully decide
on something that's mutually agreeable without repetition between the
various talks..

I'll vote twice for this one, in an attempt to swing the balance.
