There's another reason.  Practically every module has kobjects registered
all the time; they are not unregistered until the module's unload
procedure runs.  If these kobjects contributed to the modules refcount
then it would be impossible ever to rmmod the module without using the -f
flag.
Furthermore, all the excess usage counts from those kobjects would swamp
and hide the genuine usage counts (the ones that are displayed now).  The
user would have no way to know whether rmmod -f would work or would hang.
