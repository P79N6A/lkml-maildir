Why do you want cheap memory access? Normally people want this
for performance, but 32-bit apps are noticably slower.
The "well tested userland" is only well tested on a 32-bit kernel.
There are many ways in which a 64-bit kernel fails to correctly
run 32-bit apps. I just found one the other day, in the way signal
handler info gets translated from 64-bit to 32-bit. Some of your
userspace would be something I wrote, which I happen to know will
not run 100% correctly and I just don't care to "fix" it for your
wildly abnormal configuration.
I suspect you have a Windows mindset. In the Windows world, almost
nothing is 64-bit clean. Nearly every Linux app is well-tested in
64-bit form. This is because Linux was ported to the Alpha CPU
back around 1994, give or take a year. That's over a decade of
64-bit experience. It's mainly the proprietary apps that don't
run in 64-bit mode. The one big exception is OpenOffice, which
was also proprietary until Sun opened it up.
Just forget the old 32-bit crud if at all possible. Hopefully
you won't have even one 32-bit library or executable. Make it
your goal to eliminate this buggy cruft. You can use chroot()
or VMWare as needed, but cleaning house is so much nicer.

Of course there is overhead. There are also bugs, some of which
won't ever get fixed.
The bigger problem is that 32-bit code has fewer CPU registers.
(nobody has done an ILP32 ABI for long mode) This is slow.
