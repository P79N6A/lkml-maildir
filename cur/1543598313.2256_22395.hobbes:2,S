It seems to me that it'd be better with an
add_interrupt_timing_randomness() function.
This one should modify the entropy pool, and add no more to the
entropy count than the internal interrupt timing allow,
i.e. assume that "the ouside" observed the event that
trigged the interrupt.   How much is architecture dependent:
A machine with a clock-counter, like a pentium, can add
a number of bits from the counter, as the timing is
documented variable.  (There could be several interrupts
queued up, the interrupt stacks and routines
may or may not be in level-1 cache)  Even a conservative approach
assuming a lot of worst cases would end up adding _some_.
A 386 may have to add 0to the count, as it don't have a high-speed
timer.
People who have a network-only machine can go for
something better than 386 though.
