Well, the reason you'd want an out-of-band mechanism is to be able to
display it as some kind of escapes.  Consider a UTF-8 decoder which uses
values in the 0x800000xx range to encode "bogus bytes"; that way it
wouldn't alias to anything else, but the bogus sequence "C0 AE" could be
represented as 0x800000C0 0x800000AE and displayed to the user as
\xC0\xAE\xC0\xAE ... which is different from \u00C0\u00AE ("À®", C3 80
C2 AE).  This would make it possible to figure out in, for example, an
ls listing, what those broken filenames are actually composed of.
There are some advantages to being able to represent all possible byte
sequences and present them to the user, even if they're bogus.
