Having done precisely that, and ended up owning an IBM hard drive that
has hit exactly this problem, like so many before this, this firmware
upgrade idea is rather appealing. It would be nice to be able to trust
the drive...
...but I can't seem to find the firmware anywhere on the IBM storage
site or, in fact, anywhere.  Have you any hints as to where I might
look?
It's a DTLA-307030, made in Hungary, if that makes it easier to help. :)
Thanks,
