As a practical matter, I believe that storing an int to an int-aligned
address _is_ actually atomic on any CPU that can run Linux.  The
PowerPC architecture spec requires that single-word (i.e. 32-bit)
aligned stores are atomic, for instance, and I think that would be the
case on any other sane architecture as well.
The language lawyers would probably agree with you, though.
Regards,
Paul.
