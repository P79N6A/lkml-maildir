Hi
Just got the following with patch-2.6.13-rc3-git8:
# make install
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
make[1]: `arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/do_mounts_initrd.o
In file included from include/asm/unistd.h:426,
                 from include/linux/unistd.h:9,
                 from init/do_mounts_initrd.c:2:
include/asm/ptrace.h: In function `user_mode_vm':
include/asm/ptrace.h:67: error: `VM_MASK' undeclared (first use in this
function)
include/asm/ptrace.h:67: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only
