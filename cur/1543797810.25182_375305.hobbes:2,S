Sure, but having  insmod <foo>  crash the kernel is bad.
In my oppinion the kernel should be robust against accidental loading
of the wrong module. If the symbols of the module clashes with
in-kernel symbols, the logical thing is to reject the module load.
Sure you can do a lot worse things as root, but being able to cause a
crash with a standard tool such as insmod is pretty nasty and
something you can easily get into by accident.  You can't prevent root
from purposely screwing with the kernel, but accidental mis-loading of
a wrong module shouldn't cause a crash.

If there's a way to revent it 100% at build time I'd agree, but if not
I'd say a runtime solution is required.
Just my 0.02 euro.
