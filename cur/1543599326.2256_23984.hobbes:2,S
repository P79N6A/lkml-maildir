Hi, 
I need people with access to highmem machines (8GB or more) to test a
patch which should fix the current allocation failure problems under IO
stress with 2.4.10pre1.
Just stress the IO subsystem with huge amounts of data ( > 2x amount of
memory). Several threads doing the IO is preferred.

Thanks!
