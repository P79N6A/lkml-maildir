The gzip'ed config as of when I quit bisecting is attached.  It's probably
not directly usable unless you have a quilt tree that's positioned fairly
close to git-lblnet.patch.

It's actually a CVS pull of the upstream, but tcl 8.5 was released back on 
12/19, and there's nothing obvious in the 4 commits since then.  So you should
be able to snarf a 8.5 source tarball, untar it, 'cd tcl/unix', run
./configure, make, make test, and that should replicate it - the 'socket'
test hangs quite consistently for me, and a few earlier ones *sometimes*
hang.
