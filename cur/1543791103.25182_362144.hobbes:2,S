Subject: [PATCH 34/37] dvb: fix bug in demux that caused lost mpeg sections
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

From: Mark Adams <mark147m@gmail.com>
Fix a bug in the software demux which causes large MPEG sections to be lost
when they follow very small sections.
The problem happens when two sections begin in the same transport
packet.  The dvb_demux code resets its buffer only before the first of
these sections.  This means that when the second (or subsequent)
section begins, there is up to 182 bytes of buffer space already used.
If the following section is close to the maximum size, it currently
won't fit in the (4096-byte) buffer and is thrown away.
The fix is simply to enlarge the buffer by the size of one transport
packet and correct one usage of the SECFEED_SIZE definition where what
is really meant is the maximum size of a section.
