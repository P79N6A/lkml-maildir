Hi,
This error appears when I make a TCP connection to `localhost' as
127.0.0.1:
TCPv4 bad checksum from 192.168.7.1:803c to 127.0.0.1:0017, len=20/40
Kernel 2.3.21, gcc-2.95.1, binutils snapshot from 991012. Other TCP
connections to and from outside hosts work fine.
Netfilter works, too! (with the addition of the patches to the
netfilter code to be found on the netfilter mailing list; otherwise,
it gives an Oops shortly after the modules are loaded).
Thanks for looking at this,
John Hayward-Warburton
