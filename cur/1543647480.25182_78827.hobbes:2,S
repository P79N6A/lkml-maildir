Is there a specific problem here?  We tried to imitate the kernel coding 
style with this patch.
>b) please add a prototype in a header
Can you suggest which header file would be appropriate?  I would be glad to 
add the prototype there.
>c) please make it EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
LiS is LGPL.  Would it work if the exported symbol was GPL only?
As this is something of a replacement for the old exported sys_call_table, 
which was exported generally, we thought that a general export was appropriate.
Thanks,
Dave
