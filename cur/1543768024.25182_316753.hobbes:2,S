Subject: [PATCH] fix long-standing bug in 2.6/2.4 skb_copy/skb_copy_expand

This patch tweaks the skb_copy_bits() call in skb_copy() and 
skb_copy_expand().  In the sace of skb_copy():
if (skb_copy_bits(skb, -headerlen, n->head, headerlen + skb->len))
Basically, this call assumes that n->head+headerlen == n->data.
This is, fortunately, generally true.  But if the alloc_skb function 
allocates extra head room (ie calls skb_reserve() on the skb before it 
passes it to the callee, this doesn't quite work.  Instead, it should be 
rewritten as:
if (skb_copy_bits(skb, -headerlen, n->data-headerlen, headerlen + skb->len))
Rewriting it this way works; n->data-headerlen is equal to n->data 
before the skb_reserve() call.  This seems MoreCorrect(tm), as it makes 
no assumptions about the state of the skb passed into it.  (n->data just 
so happens to equal n->head too)
skb_copy_expand() has the same problem as well, and has a similar fix.
This patch is against 2.6.12-rc4, though it should apply cleanly to any 
2.4/2.6 kernel.
...
The history behind this is a little sordid -- We were trying to
implement a "poor man's zerocopy" transmit path for a braindead USB
wireless controller.  It needed a descriptor packet prepended to the
frame contents, but couldn't handle it in a separate USB packet -- so
we'd have to do a realloc on the skb to give us the headroom we eneded. 
memcpy()s on the very underpowered target were expensive, so we tried
modifying skb_alloc to always ensure there would be enough headroom for
the descriptor (allocating extra, and then skb_reserve()ing it).  It was
a crude hack, but it gained us a few much-needed percentage points of
throughput.  That is once we fixed skb_copy()..
Anyway, please consider this patch for inclusion.
