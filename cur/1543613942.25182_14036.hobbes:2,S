I care, I always like faster graphics.

You're probably overgeneralizing.  Actually, I run games on my server and 
display the graphics on my laptop.  It works.  I'd be happy if it was faster.
I don't see right off how AIO would make that happen though.  Ben, could you 
please enlighten me, what would be the mechanism?  Are other OSes doing X 
with AIO?
