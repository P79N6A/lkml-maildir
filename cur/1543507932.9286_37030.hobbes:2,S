   I will be grateful if anybody gives some insight in to this.
What address are you giving to the card for this kmalloc'd buffer?
If you are giving it the same value which was returned from kmalloc(),
this is wrong, you need to get the bus address using virt_to_bus(ptr)
and give that to the chip instead.
