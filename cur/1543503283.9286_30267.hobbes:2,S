I'm doing some work at the moment to restructure ELF files so that read-ahead
is always the best thing to do.  It collects usage statistics on the ELF file,
and regroups it so that the pages appear on disk in the order in which they're
used.  This is primarily useful for speeding up the initial flurry of demand
loading when you start up something big (eg, netscape).
