sorry, typo bug: that statement is actually 
[ `uname -r` == "2.x.x-this-script's-desired-version" ] || exit
and since mod-init-tools are in /, you may need to actually replace them all 
with wrapper scripts which call up the right one, passing all command-line 
arguments to the real one... you install the 2.4 utils, move them all (i.e., 
to *-2.4) then the same for 2.6, and make a script with the original name 
that calls the 2.6 binary when uname -r returns a 2.6 kernel, likewise with 
2.4, etc.
even easier: you may be able to get away with this hack:
mount --bind /some-dir/2.6-bin /bin
mount --bind /some-dir/2.6-lib /lib
mount --bind /some-dir/2.6-sbin /sbin
mount --bind /some-dir/2.6-etc /etc
and so on.
do this in a script that starts with that statement above, so that only when 
*your* kernel runs, it maps over the 2.4 kit without touching it.
