The idea behind CONFIG_OBSOLETE is supposed to be that it does not
actually appear as a Y/N option.  You enclose a Config.in option with
that, and it disappears 
But I'm all for removing old stuff.  There is no reason to keep
something that flat out doesn't work and hasn't for a long long time... 
if somebody wants to pick it up they can grab linux-2.2 or linux-2.0
from any FTP mirror.
