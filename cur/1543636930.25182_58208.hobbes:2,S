I wasn't able to compile 2.4.19-rc1-aa2, i should to try compile the
same kernel you have.
I would like to know is it possible to manually fix the size of kcore,
because i do have 512MB mem, not 4080GB, anybody doesn't have that much. =)
I just notified, an errormessage that shows at boot-time, got it from log,
	Jul 22 09:07:55 mikrolahti kernel: Error seeking in /dev/kmem
What may be wrong??!
