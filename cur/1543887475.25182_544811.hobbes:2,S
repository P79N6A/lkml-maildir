And none of these things are used by an ISR.

You mean it would be if it ever looked at the current pointer. It is not the
setting of the current pointer that determines the context but actually
*using* that pointer.
As you said, it is the "things which flow from the current pointer" that
matter, not the value of the pointer itself. An ISR uses none of those
things.
