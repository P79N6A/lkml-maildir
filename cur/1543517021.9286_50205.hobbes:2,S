Ingo, I think your "mb()" could just be
	#define mb() do { \
		int __dummy; \
		asm volatile("movl %%eax,%0":"=m" (&dummy): :"memory"); \
	} while (0)
which instead of using a read-modify-write cycle and a long immediate just
uses a single write-cycle. It makes gcc allocate a word on the stack, and
sometimes that might be unnecessary, but it should be smaller and faster.
You might want to check out code generation..
