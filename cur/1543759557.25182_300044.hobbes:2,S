What he said!  Perfectly good patches, which fix real problems would 
appear to be sitting in testing/broken_out till bit rot or ???.
If you want a testers testimony, I'm running the bk-ieee1394.patch, 
and all I can say at this point is that it Just Works(TM).  I have 
NDI how it got a yesterdays Mar 4) date in the directory listing 
there though, I've had it a bit longer than that by 2-3 days as my 
copy shows a Mar 1 date.  I first got it via svn fetch at 
linux-ieee1394.org or some such in January.
Fixes for real problems that fix real problems should somehow get a 
faster track into final.  The current firewire in the kernel as of 
2.6.11 is still badly borked.
If that diff in the dates means I should update and retest, please 
advise.
