What If I get up one day, and I cant print? Or build isos? That sounds minor to you, but thats a big thing if say, the linux box is a network print server, or, its the workstation for the guy in the company who builds the iso. And, no, "use the previous kernel" isnt a good excuse. Because what if you get hit with bugs back to back? You'll have to go back to some kernel way way back. Like 2.4.2. The Kernel needs Quality Assurance.
