Well, the application is this. A lot of industrial control, embedded 
processor development interfaces, and other stuff use a parallel port to 
connect to a PC. The parallel port has gone from some notebooks, and is 
soon to go from desktops too. I want to access some of those devices 
through a USB to IEEE1284 cable. If the programming interface is ppdev, 
that is great - no changes needed for code that already works with a 
real parallel port. If it requires a somewhat different API, that's no 
big deal. Being able to bit twiddle to the extent that ppdev allows is 
pretty important, though. I guess there may be some latency issues 
slowing the bit twiddling across a USB interface, but nothing's perfect.
Regards,
Steve
