Hi All,
May be you will say that this has been answered somewhere, but I am not
really able to understand what to do?
I recently installed RHL 8.0 on a SGI1200 server. The server has 
"Adaptec AIC-7896 SCSI BIOS v2.20S1B1" installed.
When I boot the system, the two SCSI channels are recognised, and then the
system is not able to initialise. The partial error codes are:
aic7xxx_abort returns 0x2002
SCSI 0:0:0:0: Attempting to queue TARGET RESET message
SCSI 0:0:0:0: Is not an active device
The system then probes the SCSI 0:0:1:0 channel upto SCSI 0:0:15:0 and
then goes for SCSI channel 2, for all the 15 devices.
Can anyone please tell me what should I do? The system was earlier running
on RHL 6.2
Thanx in advance.
With Best Regards
HimS
