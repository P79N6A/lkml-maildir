another question: it seems the fluidsynth threads are running as non-RT
threads - they are soft-synthesizing sound that jackd will mix and play. 
Now, can any delay of these fluidsynth threads (they are non-RT tasks
and can get delayed indefinitely) cause an xrun in Jackd, or should it
'only' make the sound more choppy?
