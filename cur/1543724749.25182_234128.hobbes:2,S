right, the LABEL=/ never works for me so I always replace it with explicit 
"root=/dev/sda2" thing, but this is problematic if "/dev/sda2" becomes 
"/dev/hda2" if you boot with IDE driver compiled in, as opposed to SATA 
driver.
I assumed that "LABEL=/" thing is a RedHat-specific kernel's feature but 
never bothered to check. The reason I assumed so was that the problems 
always happen after installation, i.e. as soon as I replace the vendor's 
generic kernel with the one properly optimized for my specific needs.
Kind regards
Tigran
