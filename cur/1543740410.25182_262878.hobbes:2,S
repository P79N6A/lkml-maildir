It is already meaningless, IMHO, in this short example. But when you have such 
code:
        if (sscanf(argv[2], SECTOR_FORMAT, &cc->iv_offset) != 1) {
                ti->error = PFX "Invalid iv_offset sector";
                goto bad4;
        }
        if (sscanf(argv[4], SECTOR_FORMAT, &cc->start) != 1) {
                ti->error = PFX "Invalid device sector";
                goto bad4;
        }
it becomes even uglier.
Why cannot we simply define the macro in linux/types.h and go along? There is 
no reason at all for arch-dependent definition of this macro; we can handle 
CONFIG_LBD in arch-independent code. In fact, it's what I'm doing.
I'm resending the patch, removing altogether HAVE_SECTOR_T and anything in 
arch-code referring to that. For h8300, I'm unconditionally defining 
CONFIG_LBD in Kconfig.
An even better road would would be to use always a "unsigned long long" for 
64-bit sector_t even on 64-bit archs.
Is there any reason for having u/s64 being "(unsigned) long" instead of 
"(unsigned) long long"? I.e., must we cope with braindead gcc? If not, this 
should be fixed, to avoid even other such problems.
Bye
