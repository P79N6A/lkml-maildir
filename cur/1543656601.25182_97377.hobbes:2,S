Hello,
If I try to open (to view) /proc/net/tcp in midnight commander then 
the midnight commander freezes in kernel (cannot be killed) with 99% CPU usage.
I do not see any disk_io line in /proc/stat although I have /dev/hda as primary
disk. Maybe because I'm using boot_off first and ide=reverse. So real /dev/hda
does not exist and /dev/hde is as /dev/hda.
