I actually suggested that order because the only way the printk can be
done correctly is for it to be the very last test made. Since the mode
filter is not told what mode will be used but just subtracts modes that
are not allowed this should be safe.
I don't otherwise see how we deal with the case where a 40wire cable is
used and the mode filter function decides itself to drop to UDMA33 or
lower due to incompatibilities or errata.
