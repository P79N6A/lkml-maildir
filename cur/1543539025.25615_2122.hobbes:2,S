Hi again,
Made a mistake in this report.
I was actually running against the older WDC AC22100H.
But I have now retested with the newer WDC AC33200L and
the result is the same. I get worse latencies with the
AC33200L (latencies from audio interrupt with a SCHED_FIFO
process that itself does no disk IO)
The pattern looks like the new WD disk has fewer but longer
spikes than the Seagate.
[Note: there are probably lots of even better disks than the
 Seagate - bought it since it is big and cheap (quiet too)]
