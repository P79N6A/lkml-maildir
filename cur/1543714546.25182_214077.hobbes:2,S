Thats more than what I could have expected, thanks.
Ross, I tested my kernel with nmi_watchdog=1 and nmi_watchdog=2 getting only 2 
to work.
output: nmi_watchdog=1
activating NMI Watchdog ... done.
testing NMI watchdog ... CPU#0: NMI appears to be stuck!
output: nmi_watchdog=2
testing NMI watchdog ... OK.
This is on 2.6.5-mm5-1.
Concerning the timer, well I tested it against my radio-controlled clock, 
setting it with ntpdate first and letting the system run (with ntpd off) and 
my system is kinda faster than my radio-clock. After about one hour my system 
was off by +14s compared to the radio-clock. I don't know if that is pretty 
shitty or simply normal for these bad pc-clocks...
I'm now compiling 2.6.6-rc1 with the nmi_watchdog=1 workaround. One question 
about the C1idle-patch, does this add a new feature or is it just a 
workaround for locked up nforce2-systems (since I never experienced lockups 
on my system, I wouldn't need it then)?
thanks for now, christian.
