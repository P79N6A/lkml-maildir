This is just to avoid a warning from gcc that a pointer is converted
to a 32bit integer -- which is ok here since it uses a "void *" callback argument
to pass an integer.
Arguably there should be a standard macro for this construct, but there
isn't currently.

Yes it is. It handles additional CPUs.
