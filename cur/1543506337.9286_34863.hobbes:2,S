It should do.  The big advantage you have is that by implementing IO via
kiobufs, your IO routines won't actually care in the slightest where the
memory is coming from.  You can implement a mmap() interface later if
you want, creating a kiobuf and populating it from the mapped kernel
pages, and use exactly the same IO routines to work on that buffer as if
it had come from map_user_kiobuf().
