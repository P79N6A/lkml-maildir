Hi,
I am building linux kernel 2.6.9-6 with Intel
Compiler.
Compilation is successfull.
While booting, kernel panic is reprted.
I also found the place of kernel panic. It is in
"apply_alternatives" function. Commenting this
function boots the kernel, but then there are Xserver
and network related problems.
I found that  in __alt_instructions is array of
structures of "alt_instr".
struct alt_instr {
        __u8 *instr;            /* original
instruction */
        __u8 *replacement;
        __u8  cpuid;            /* cpuid bit set for
replacement */
        __u8  instrlen;         /* length of original
instruction */
        __u8  replacementlen;   /* length of new
instruction, <= instrlen */
        __u8  pad;
};
While debuging it is found that this array has NULL
value for member 'instr' (except first ).
i.e. __alt_instrctions[1].instr ,
__alt_instrctions[2].instr , ... are all NULL.
This causes Kernel panic.
Could you please suggest why these member are NULL ?
Thanks in advance.
