NB, there is an exception for atime, which seems to do its own thing.

Some of the Linux filesystems aren't compliant in this regard.  Grep for
CURRENT_TIME in fs/*/*.c and you'll see a few places where i_mtime is
set and i_ctime is not.

That's ok.  If it's implemented as an attribute, then a filesystem which
doesn't support the feature will show up clearly and I can fall back to
another, slower mechanism, or just assume the file has changed every time.

It's the only choice _at the moment_.  That's why I'm arguing :-)

ctime would only be modifed when a particular attribute is set on the
directory, and the attribute changes.  So the directory does not have to
comply with POSIX.1 anyway.  This is supports the fast-recursive-make
style of application (where it's ok to declare a directory as
"non-POSIX.1"), but not updatedb or system-wide backups.

I am thinking of ways to share bits with the NFS generation field...
The same kind of bit shuffling and combination with ctime I mentioned
for change detection could perhaps be used to reduce the bits required
to generate a reliable generation number.  After all, we can assume that
recycled inodes have a new ctime every second...  Do you have any ideas
here?

That is an interesting idea for change detection.  If an inode stays in
core, changes can be detected accurately by any app.  Refuse to release
an inode from memory for 1 second after it's ctime changes (it can be
written, just not freed), and the detection is accurate always.  That
is, as long as the system clock does not jump...

To avoid clobbering POSIX times, something to do with attributes and/or
parts of the generation number would seem to be required.
