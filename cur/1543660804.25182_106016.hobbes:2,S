The pagetable preconstruction cache hit is spread across
clear_page_tables() and pgd_ctor() with the pgd_ctor patches.
This is the equivalent of the explicit zeroing in pgd_alloc().
Your result appears to imply the overhead has been reduced by 36%,
which is useful evidence for the PAE case. Before this the pgd_alloc()
overhead had only been observed on non-PAE systems.
Now, YTF hadn't I seen this before if all it took to bring it out was
a kernel compile? Perhaps diffprof (I prefer the multiplicative flavor
but nm that) of some flavor was lacking.
