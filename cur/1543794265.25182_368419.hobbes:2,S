I don't think selinux can give you the granularity to say
"process can access this bit of the file only", at least not yet.
Even if that was capable however, it still doesn't solve the problem.
Pavel's implementation wants to write to arbitary address spaces, which is
what we're trying to prevent. The two are at odds with each other.
