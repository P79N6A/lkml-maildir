I just dislike using the same values twice and not using constants. More of a
personal thing I guess.

I see. Why do you use if-statement-indenting then?
What is the sense of the empty comments? What sense does the 'immediate
return' make when the value is returned 2 lines below (where one line is just
a closing brace)?

Sure, but I guess you don't have to tell me what files I put my nose in, do
you? I didn't mean to personally piss you off by sending this in. Tzzz ...
Unfortunately my understanding of how ie. the Linux VM works is not very good.
In fact it's poor. But I will dig into this and try to make even you happy with
a patch that makes sense _in your eyes_.
