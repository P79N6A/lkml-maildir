In my experience, that bug is related with acpi.  In a kernel compiled
without acpi, the card works perfectly, in a kernel compiled with acpi
it depend on the phase of the moon and similar things :(
The driver for some reason sets too much 1.  I have one of my machines
conected using dhcp, and it almost never got the right address the
first boot (a reset _usually_ fix the problem, not always).  Some
times, only some bits are set in the mac address, I think that a
couple of times, I have got a MAC with all FF in the address.  
Worse still is the fact, that sometimes it is not the MAC address what
is afected, it is also the vendor ip/product id, that makes that the
driver is not recognized by the driver module.
I have tried both, the standard driver and the 3com "official" driver,
both have that problem.  I already informend Andrew Grover about the
problem, but he is not sure what is happening.
Later, Juan "wondering what sane network card's are still on the market".
