Okay, so the driver is in fact not working. It could be that /dev/tpm
has the wrong device number assigned. If the driver is really installed
can be checked by
	systool -c misc|grep tpm
I bet it does not show anything. OTOH if the module loads successfully
it really should be there. No idea what's going wrong then. 
Which version of the driver are you using?
