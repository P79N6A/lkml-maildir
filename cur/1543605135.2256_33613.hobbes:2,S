This is normal. Nobody has fixed the RPC server code. There are plenty
of possible sources of the above problem, but my main suspect is the
fact that the TCP reply code uses blocking socket operations (will
change once we actually go in for supporting TCP), but doesn't provide
any mechanism for preventing another thread from using the socket
while the original writer is sleeping.
Fix: Set up a semaphore in the struct svc_sock somewhere, and use it
to gate write acces to the socket...
Cheers,
