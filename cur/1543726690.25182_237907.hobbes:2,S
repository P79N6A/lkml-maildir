I may need core help. The executable is postprocessed by a program in
arch/sparc/boot/ and so some kind of hook to give it a chance to
properly fix up the symbol table (which I'll have to add afresh), for
instance, an extra stage of .tmp_vmlinux*, seems to be needed.
It treats vmlinux as a throwaway, and does the real linking pass in
arch/sparc/boot/; exchanging the roles of the top-level and arch
linking phases in the makefiles is all that's needed to fix this up.
Once an optional extra pass is okayed, it's a SMOP to deal with the
rest (i.e. the real undefined symbol).
