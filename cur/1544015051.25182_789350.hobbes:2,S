The problem is that the threshold for that is architecture specific.
While e.g. x86 has relatively low overhead of prologue/epilogue other
architectures like s390 have enormous overhead.  So handling this in
the compiler would be optimal, but it would need at least whole-program
optimization and a compiler aware of the inline assembly to get it
half-way right.
