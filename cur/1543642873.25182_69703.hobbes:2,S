The current scsi multi-path code handles the above cases. There is
a scsi_path_decide_disposition() that fails paths independent of the
result of the IO. It is similiar to the current scsi_decide_disposition,
except it also fails the path. So for a check condition of media error,
the IO might be marked as SUCCESS (meaning completed with an error),
but the path would not be modified (there are more details than this).

Yes, that is a good idea, I was thinking that this should be done
via sg, and modify sg to allow path selection - so no matter what, sg
could be used to probe a path.  I have no plans to expose a user level
device for each path, but a device model "file" could be exposed for
the state of each path, and its state controlled via driverfs.
