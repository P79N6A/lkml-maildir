Huh?  We're talking about 50 lines of code for insmod (modprobe is
harder, yes).  But risking this instability is what unstable kernels
are *for*!
You're still talking about forcing us to maintain a *very intimate*
interface in order to remove 200 lines from the kernel.  Ask Keith the
troubles of keeping modutils in sync with the kernel.  I've been
following it for about 18 months, and I haven't envied the (excellent)
job he had to do.
200 lines! 8)
Rusty.
