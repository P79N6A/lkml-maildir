Right now, no; the user space utilities grab the version number from
the header files.  I haven't figured out a sane way to straighten this
out; this was the best I could come up with for now.  In general, the
version of the kernel stuff is what matters: the user space tools
don't change much, and the API is pretty much static, so you don't
need to recompile them all the time.
