My FX150 is inflicted when using Sony's WinXP or Win2K BIOS.
The WinME BIOS it shipped with was fine... If you need to identify
problematic machines, I don't think the DMI product name check is
going to be sufficient... better match on BIOS revision also.
Note that the ACPI IRQ routing in the recent (20020329 for me)
ACPI patches is an effective workaround as well. It's turned
on by default when you enable ACPI, which you probably want to do
anyway on most of these laptops to get battery status, poweroff
on shutdown, etc.
