Hi,
I am on a SUSE 9 box.  My problem is I cannot ssh in from my pc.  I can
ssh in from other pc's.  I can also telnet in from my pc.
Can anyone give me a hand?  Would there be someting that might be
blocking my I/P.
I run putty,  port 22,
I enter a login name
I enter the password 
I then get "ACCESS DENIED"
It almost looks like this terminal is not allowed ssh.
Thanks
