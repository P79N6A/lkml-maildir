To clarify further, I am talking about the sample driver I submitted earlier
at
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103721364225087&w=2
The patch implements a char device that enables arbitrary printk's to be
inserted at in arbitrary kernel addresses.  It is used by writing strings of
the
form "0xADDRESS MESSAGE" to the device.
I was looking for a way to verify the address passed in was valid before
creating and inserting a new probe.
Maybe there is a better way to verify a kernel address is valid before
messing
with it?
