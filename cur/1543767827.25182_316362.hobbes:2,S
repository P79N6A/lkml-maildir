Subject: [PATCH 12 of 12] Fix Tpm driver -- locks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/5/143

Please apply these fixes to the Tpm driver.  I am resubmitting the entire
patch set that was orginally sent to LKML on April 27 with the changes
that were requested fixed.
This patch was updated to reflect a change in a previous patch in this 
set so it will cleanly apply.
Thanks,
Kylie
A lock in the register hardware is missing and the one in release is 
misplaced. This patch fixes these issues.
