:
"The Extent File System (efs) is Silicon Graphics' early block-device 
filesystem, widely used on pre-6.0 versions of IRIX. Since 6.0, xfs 
has been bundled with IRIX and users are being encouraged to migrate 
to xfs filesystems. IRIX support for efs will be read-only in 
versions of IRIX beyond 6.5, however efs is still very much in use on 
SGI software distribution CDs."
