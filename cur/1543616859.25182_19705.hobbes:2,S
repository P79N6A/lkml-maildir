I wouldn't say it gets it wrong, the driver also has to take a non irq
spinlock anyway, so the window is quite small and even then the packet
is only delayed.
But now I really have to look at that driver and try a more optimistic
irq disabling approach, otherwise it will happily disable the most
important shared interrupt on my Amiga for ages.
