"sic" doesn't stand for "spelling is correct", or even "stated in
context" (yech!).
In fact, it stands for "yes, I know it looks funny, but that's how I want
it". But people got tired of typing Y,IKILF,BTHIWI so they abbreviated
it to SIC. Then they got tired of pressing caps lock or shift, as is
common on the internet (i see it all the time), and started writing it
as "sic".
Someone said it was Latin for "thus" or "so", but that's just plain
outlandish - anyone who knew Latin could probably take some time to
learn to spell too.
