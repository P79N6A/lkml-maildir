Hi,
I've got quite the same problem, but it's not as simple as vojtech said.
I have, of course, switched the controller mode to 'other OS' and the
controller is being recognized by the system. Everything is fine as long
as I use kernel 2.4.4, the raid array is being recognized and working.
Whenever I switch to 2.4.13-ac8, 2.4.14 or 2.4.15-pre7 the system
freezes with kernel panic, so there seems to be a problem with current
kernels.
Any suggestions ???
Thanks,
Thomas
