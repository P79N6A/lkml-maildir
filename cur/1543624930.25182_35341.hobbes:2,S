You need to put on the distributed-think hat.  The problem is never
what I do in any one instance, we can do all sorts of useful things
in that instance.  The problem is doing them in such a way so that
synchronization with repositories which are both ahead and behind works.
So if you repull from whereever you just pulled from, the system needs
to remember that some cset is a duplicate and has been eliminated.
And if you pull in the opposite direction, the past events, including
duplicate removal, propagate.
*All* of this stuff is trivial if you don't care about passing it on, if
your repository is a backwater dead end.  But that's not the case.
So you have to decide that you want the events to propagate and if you
do, then we can do something about it.
I'm starting to get psyched about this, I think I see a picture that 
works, I need to chew on it for a bit though.
