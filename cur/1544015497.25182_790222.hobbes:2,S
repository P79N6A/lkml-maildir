Should is too soft, we cannot. What if it changes mainline files, they will
not have common ancestry. And also the sub-tree checkout un-checkout will take
ages. Chris must have merged with his subtree with a rebase not a merge. I suspect
Linus git tree will have to rebase. This is the first time I've seen such a merge.
for example see be0e5c097f it has no parent, and so on.
