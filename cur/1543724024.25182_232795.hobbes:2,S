The problem is the process the /proc/<PID>/mem of which you're reading
may be ptrace-detached and proceed into a SUID/SGID exec while you're
still inside mem_read().  This was the reason for my addition of the
may_ptrace_attach() function and its uses in mem_read() in 2.4.21-ow2
and 2.4.22.  Here's an excerpt from an e-mail I wrote at the time:

Re-checking permissions is what I had implemented.

I think this is a different issue.  You seem to be complaining about
the older MAY_PTRACE() check, not about the added may_ptrace_attach()
check.  Alan has already pointed out a reason why the MAY_PTRACE()
check was needed:

See Alan's example I've quoted above.  In this scenario, it would be
the program being attacked which will be checked for possession of the
capability... if it is SUID root, the attack will succeed.
As for the checks performed inside may_ptrace_attach(), they're
derived from ptrace itself and are due to numerous attacks which
otherwise were possible on ptrace.  /proc/<PID>/mem is very similar.

I don't understand the attack you're describing here.  If anything
changes after mem_read() has already returned, then it's not our
business: the process has obtained a copy of data it had legitimate
access to.
