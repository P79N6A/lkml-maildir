I am using SpeedTouch 330 modem with kernel driver (on Gentoo).
The instalation is currently (with firmware loader instead of modem_run) 
very simple: USE="atm" emerge ppp, download firmware and place it in 
/lib/firmware, compile the kernel with speedtch support.
I tried to use userspace driver some time ago but it wasn't working for me 
so I gave up. I was using modem_run with kernel driver for long time to 
load the firmware but there were many problems with it too (nearly every 
kernel or modem_run upgrade was breaking something, modem_run was hanging 
in D state in most unapropriate moments and so on).
Now I am using pure kernel driver and firmware loader and it works 100% 
ok. There were no problems with it for long time. And I don't even want to 
look at this userspace driver again.
Since Linux newer was (or is going to be) userspace-driver OS, maybe we 
should leave it that way...
