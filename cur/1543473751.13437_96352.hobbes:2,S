	2.2.0pre2 freezes shortly after boot on one of my machines, with the
following message:
Checking if this processor honours the WP bit even in supervisor mode... No.
Kernel panic: This kernel doesn't support CPU's with broken WP. Recompile it
 for a 386!
In swapper task - not syncing
	This machine worked fine with 2.2.0pre1, and for many 2.1.xxx
kernels before that, and it's been using the same .config file, with "make
oldconfig", right along. CONFIG_M386=y, other processor types are not set. 
	The config process seems to have added a "CONFIG_WP_WORKS_OK=y" line
to the .config file for pre2... I'm going to try compiling it with that line
changed to "n" by hand, but that's going to take a while (it *is* a 386,
after all), so I thought I'd send up a flare to let anyone who might know
what's going on know about this.
