static int
ath_pci_probe(struct pci_dev *pdev, const struct pci_device_id *id)
[...]
        if (request_irq(dev->irq, ath_intr, SA_SHIRQ, dev->name, dev)) {
                printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: request_irq failed\n", dev->name);
                goto bad3;
        }
[...]
        athname = ath_hal_probe(id->vendor, id->device);
        printk(KERN_INFO "%s: %s: mem=0x%lx, irq=%d\n",
                dev->name, athname ? athname : "Atheros ???", phymem, dev->irq);
        /* ready to process interrupts */
        sc->aps_sc.sc_invalid = 0;
No sources for ath_hal_probe, too bad.
However, even without any sources, a driver which includes an "I am not ready
to process interrupts" flag and issue request_irq() without having disabled
the device first makes me a bit nervous.
