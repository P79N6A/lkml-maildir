There seem to be some confusion about what my patch really does. It
does not set the hardware address to a zero value.
An example to illustrate:
We have two computers.
Computer A
IP: 192.168.0.1
HW: 00:AA:00:AA:00:AA
Computer B
IP: None
HW: 00:BB:00:BB:00:BB
Computer B want to find out if IP 192.168.0.1 is free for use. It
sends an arp-request.
Request:
Opcode: request (0x0001)
Sender HW: 00:BB:00:BB:00:BB
Sender IP:    0.0.0.0
Target HW:   00:00:00:00:00:00
Target IP:     192.168.0.1
The reply from the Linux kernel in computer A, before the patch would look like:
Reply:
Opcode: reply (0x0002)
Sender HW: 00:AA.00:AA:00:AA
Sender IP:   192.168.0.1
Target HW:  00:AA:00:AA:00:AA
Target IP:    192.168.0.1
And the reply from the Linux kernel, in computer A, after the patch
would look like:
Reply:
Opcode: reply (0x0002)
Sender HW: 00:AA.00:AA:00:AA
Sender IP:   192.168.0.1
Target HW:  00:BB:00:BB:00:BB
Target IP:    0.0.0.0
It is the fact that the Target HW  address is set to computer A and
not computer B that my patch wants to fix. And the Target IP: 0.0.0.0
is because OpenBSD and windows replied in that way.
I wanted to change this because, among other things, dhcpcd-2.0.3 has
the following code in its arpCheck-function:
if ( memcmp(ArpMsgRecv.tHaddr,ClientHwAddr,ETH_ALEN) )
if ( DebugFlag )
	    	syslog(LOG_DEBUG,
	    	"target hardware address mismatch:"  [...]
This check will always fail when replies come from Linux machines,
since the target hardware address will not match the client mac
address.
