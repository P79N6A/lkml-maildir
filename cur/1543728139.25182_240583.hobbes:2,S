Don't be naive. How do you discuss changes with him? The one patch I did
create against the SUSE cdrecord for the one shipped with SL9.1 adds a
note to use ATA over ATAPI since that is preferred, and it kills the
silly open-by-devname warnings that are extremely confusing to users. I
did send that back to Joerg, to no avail.

By far the largest modification is dvd support, which we of course need
to ship. The rest is really minor stuff.
