These aren't driver-core updates, these are new drivers.
It seems I missed when this was sent for review to linus-kernel.
Some random nitpicks:
- SPEAKUP_DEFAULT shouldn't be asked if SPEAKUP=n
- "make namespacecheck" shows tons of needlessly global code
- the static variable special_handler is EXPORT_SYMBOL'ed
- #define MIN should be removed
- the file cvsversion.h only for keeping a CVS date is a bit
  overkill
- spk_con_module.h is not exactly how we use header files in the kernel
- many of the #ifdef MODULE's point to things that could be done better
  (especially the #include "mod_code.c"'s)
- the things in synthlist.h could be done less ugly
- speakupconf is a userspace script that belongs under Documentation/
- dtload.c is not kernel code, and should therefore not be in that
  directory
- the code should follow Documentation/CodingStyle better
  (no spaces between the braces and function arguments)
- building speakup_keyhelp.c modular even in a kernel that doesn't
  support modules is silly
- #include <linux/...> belongs before #include <asm/...>
