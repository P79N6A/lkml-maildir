Hi,
OK, so here is the patch adding platform_device_del() that we were
discussing. The second patch just moves exports around so we do not
mix two styles in one source file.
Greg, if you are OK with it - are you going to push it or maybe I
should put it in my tree so I can publish pieces depending on this
as they are getting ready?
