If you run "top" and press 'M' it sorts processes by memory used.  The
other Mem numbers printed are also of interest, "active" and "inactive"
are cached data pages, "buff" are metadata buffers.  Also, /proc/slabinfo
will show memory allocated by kernel processes.  Any gigantic numbers in
there are generally a sign of memory leak or imbalance in the kernel.
Also include the output of /proc/meminfo if it isn't a user process.
Cheers, Andreas
