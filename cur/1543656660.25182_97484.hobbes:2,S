That would make it impossible for the kernel to have kernel-controlled
data on that page|other page though...
I personally would like to see some better interface than mmap()
/proc/self/mem in order to alias pages, anyway.  We could use a
MAP_ALIAS flag in mmap() for this (where the fd would be ignored, but
the offset would matter.)
