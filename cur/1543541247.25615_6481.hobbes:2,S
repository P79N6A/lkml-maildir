hi all,
I don't know why people feel like removing ACPI on smp boxes,
but I've found this below :
http://www.asuscom.de/Products/Techref/Acpi/solution.html
this is actually a hardware flaw on some Asus motherboards that
will load the second CPU with spurious interrupts 50% of its time, no matter what.
It's definitely NOT kernel related then.
Now you might have other good reasons to disable acpi that I am not aware of,
so ...
