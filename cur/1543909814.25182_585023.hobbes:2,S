I believe James is referring to my Promise issue. That is -  the
customers mutipath enclosure our SAS controller.  They have alternating
luns mapped to each path.  The odd luns mapped to a single path, and the
even luns to the other.  When a cable is pulled, a check condition is
generated (0x6, 0x3F, 0xE),  means report_luns data has changed.  What
the enclosure does it move the luns over to the alternate path.    Our
driver is not reporting the new luns because no event is generated to
mpt fusion driver from controller firmware (firmware only reports when a
target has been added/removed, not lun).     The mpt fusion driver
reports to the sas transport layer, the libata layer is not involved.
Shouldn't someone above sscsi lld be snooping that sence, and then
sending REPORT_LUNS to find out what changed.       
I've added some Promise contacts,  I hope they include the interested
partied to this discussion.
