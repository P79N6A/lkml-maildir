Posix stuff is interesting if it improves inter-communications among realtime
tasks & linux processes ( shared mem, mbx, sem, sig, ....). And so trying to
keep Realtime behavior between both Worlds ( no priority inversion, multi
thread safe, fair context switch,...) .
This stuff could be used to develop ( and debug )  applications first on
plain linux and then depending on Architectural choices and realtime
constraints to migrate towards RTLinux.
It could also help to port legacy applications from OS to OS.
Hope this Help!
