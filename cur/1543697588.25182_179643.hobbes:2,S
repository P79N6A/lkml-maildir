I tried to apply
20_v4l2-2.6.0-test8.diff
30_tuner-2.6.0-test8.diff
30_btaudio-2.6.0-test8.diff
30_bttv-0.9.x-2.6.0-test8.diff
30_i2c-2.6.0-test8.diff
bttv-patch didn't apply cleanly, but I applied
it manually. Compiling gave these errors (as expected (tm) )
In file included from drivers/media/video/bttv-driver.c:39:
drivers/media/video/bttvp.h:44:29: media/ir-common.h: No such file or directory
In file included from drivers/media/video/bttv-driver.c:39:
drivers/media/video/bttvp.h:267: error: field `ir' has incomplete type
As I'm using test-10, do you have updated patches?
