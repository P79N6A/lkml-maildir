Well, this wasn't about this driver but about some other piece of
Winbond hardware for which I have written a driver (drivers/mmc/wbsd.c).
The things I need to know are:
 * How does the hardware determine which MMC commands are data
transfers? It would seem it has a (incomplete) list of opcodes internally.
 * Is it a known hardware bug that the FIFO usage bits in the FSR
register always read as zero?
