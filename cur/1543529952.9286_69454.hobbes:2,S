Hi,
	I've got a PC and laptop with an IR link between them, the PC has
a JetEye dongle, and the laptop an smc-ircc running in SIR mode, IR runs
fine, but if I start irlan on the pc, and then on the laptop the first
time it works fine, the laptop gets an Ethernet addr+IP addr for the
interface, however if I move the laptop out of range, and reboot, bring it
back in and start irlan on it, it gets the IP but no ethernet addr from
the PC, I have to restart irlan on the PC by rmmod and insmod the irlan
modules...
Regards,
	Dave.
