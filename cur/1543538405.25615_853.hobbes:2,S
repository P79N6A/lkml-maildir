Hi David,
	Try "Best Crypt" - free for non commercial.
	It's on freshmeat somewhere amongst a few other solutions.
	or: 
http://www.jetico.com/index.htm#/linux.html
	if you want to skip the search.
	It's very good, but uses a file in an existing file system, as the place to
write data to, so i presume it's not as optimal as writing directly to disk.
	It works quite happily on my little P133 though, has blowfish, 3des,
twofish + others.
Have fun,
Dave
