But that's ok.
If you have the logic that
	if (put_page_testzero(pmd_page)) {
		... do the lower-level free ...
		__free_pages_ok(pmd_page, 0);
	}
then you automatically have exactly the behaviour you want, with no
locking at all (except for the "local" locking inherent in the atomic
decrement-and-test).
What you have is:
 - _if_ the count was > 1, then you do nothing at all (except for
   decrementing your count)
 - for the last user (and for that _only_), where the count was 1 and goes
   to zero, you'll do the inside of the "if ()" statement, and actually
   clean up the page table and free the pmd.
So you not only get the optimization you want, you also quite naturally
get the "exclusive last user" case.
