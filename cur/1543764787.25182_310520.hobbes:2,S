Way ahead of you.
This is (one reason) why all git objects have the type embedded inside of 
them. The format of all objects is totally regular: they are all 
compressed with zlib, they are all named by the sha1 file, and they all 
start out with a magic header of "<typename> <typesize><nul byte>".
So if I want to create a new kind of tree object that does the same thing 
as the old one but has some other layout, I'd just call it something else. 
Like "dir". That was what I initially planned to do about the change to 
recursive tree objects, but it turned out to actually be a lot easier to 
just encode it in the old type (that way the routines that read it don't 
even have to care about old/new types - it's all the same to them).
