Hello!
In kernel 2.4.19 the rootfstype and rootflags option isn't documented,
and it isn't an easy task to search them out from the source (espicially
if the one who do it is not a kernel hacker...).
Please give them two line at least. And in the BootPrompt-HOWTO this
options also can't be found.
Thanks,
Gergely
