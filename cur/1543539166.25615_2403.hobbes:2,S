    i have a 4270XDVD with the same ToPIC100 controller, and i'm currently
using a D-Link DFE-660 to send this message.  it's probably the case that
the Xircom CardBus Ethernet controller isn't supported rather than the
ToPIC100.
    btw, offtopic: has anybody gotten the S3 Savage X server on the 4200
series to work?  please mail me directly, i don't want to flood lkml.
