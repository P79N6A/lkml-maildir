I can see nothing wrong with your patches, but you should make the
patch descriptions a little clearer:

This line is completely redundant, as it states the same information
as the subject. You should give some background information here,
like:
kdebug.h is needed for kprobes.
For trivial patches where the subject already tells the whole story
(e.g. 'remove redundant declaration of foo'), just leave out the
description entirely except for the Signed-off-by.

you can even leave out the description
