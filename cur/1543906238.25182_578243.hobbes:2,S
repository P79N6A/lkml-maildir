Yes - I doubled checked this with the AHCI people - and of course you
have Edvin's testing to prove it does fine.

OK - I changed it.

Thanks, I fixed that too.
As far as moving the enable/disable_pm calls to EH - can you take
a look at the other patch I sent which implements the shost_attrs
to see if I still need to do this?  I really don't know much about
the EH stuff - can you explain why we need to use it to set the
link pm?
thanks for your review, 
Kristen
