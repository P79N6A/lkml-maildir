AFAIunderstood (I did not build the hardware) the RTS and DTR pins are
supposed to give the voltage required. There is an additional capacitor
(150uF) to keep the signals high enough, but we don't see anything on the
oscilloscope that accounts for the C.
I didn't build the hardware, I am CC'ing this to Guido who does the
programming and did all the experimenting, he should be able to explain it
a little better.
PS: Deutsch ist auch ok. Jedenfalls für mich :)
