 Maybe. However, I did not understand, have you any reasonable explanation
 how can I get such a socket. Indeed, I have been dealing with active
 connection: I traced a squid redirector at a peak time of users web

 when this window become frozen.
 If your model does not cover such situation, pls, take it in mind. :)
