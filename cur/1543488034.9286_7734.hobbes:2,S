I've been having the same problem with the 3C905.  It appears that it is
linked to the powerdown of the monitor.  The network will die as soon as
the VESA blanking shuts down the monitor.  Also note that the network here
is only two machines(both Linux boxes running 2.2.2) and with a single hub
between the two.  
I've also had this problem with 2.2.1 and I am unsure of 2.2.0 as I didn't
run 2.2.0 on the suspect machine, but I can try if necessary.
