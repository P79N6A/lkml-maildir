I sent such patch fragmented to Linus so some part should show up in the
2.3.x tree soon. For some thing (iopl killing) as suggested by Linus it
has to be done in another way to allow ioperm to be threated similar to
iopl and for other architectures. That's all work in progress.
For now you can go safe and you can apply such patch if you want to run
2.3.x without getting oom hangs (even it such patch is not exactly clean
as what will show up in the real kernel eventually).
