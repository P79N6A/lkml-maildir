okay. Can you eliminate the X stalls with setting X priority to -10 or so
(or SCHED_FIFO - although SCHED_FIFO is much more dangerous). And how does
interactivity under the same load look like with vanilla .64, as compared
to .64+combo? First step is to ensure that the new changes did not
actually hurt interactivity.
