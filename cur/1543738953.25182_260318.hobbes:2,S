Well, first you have to invalidate any preceding speculative reads and, as you
correctly stated, abstain from any further speculative reads until all reads
preceding the barrier have completed. This restriction, however, does not force
us to wait at the barrier until all reads have completed (as a read barrier
would). We can continue to execute instructions for which all reads they depend
on have completed.
As a result, all read_barrier_depends() does is to prohibit reordering of
dependent instructions _across_ the barrier.

True. Note that Alpha is the only architecture whose read_barrier_depends()
macro expands to something other than a no-op.
