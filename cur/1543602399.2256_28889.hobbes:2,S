Well, most of the PCI & interrupt frameworks are mostly arch specific.
I can't tell for MIPS, but the way you setup a PCI host bridge on PPC
was written by me and Paulus without looking at MIPS. 
I don't think there is real need to have common code here. Maybe some
common definitions (register defs for example) could go into a linux/*.h
file.
