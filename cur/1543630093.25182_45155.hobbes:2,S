   Well imagining you really wanted to do it you could skip a store 
   instruction or put a dummy value in the register that something is being 
   loaded into.
What is a suitable dummy value?  Zero?  That would likely lead to a
segfault if the value being loaded is supposed to be some pointer.
There is no reasonable behavior other than to kill the process if it
has not specified it's own handler.
