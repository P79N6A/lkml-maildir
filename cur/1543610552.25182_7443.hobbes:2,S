Never 2.4 kernels already try to excecute ~/bin/installkernel in the
'make install' pass on i386.
My personal tip for people keeping lots of kernels around is grub, though.
No need for a menu entry, one can just boot all kernel on the accessible
filesystems.
Together with the above "~/bin/installkernel" option I put my kernels always
into /lib/modules/<version>/vmlinux so I can find them easily (IMHO this
should be default in 2.5), so even lilo-using people could write simple
scripts to add all kernels present in /lib/modules/ to their config.
This does of course make the path '/lib/modules/' grossly misnamed, maybe
we could change it into /kernel in 2.5 :)

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
