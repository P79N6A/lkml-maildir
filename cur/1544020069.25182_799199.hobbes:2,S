No difference - tg3 is still dead after resume.
BTW, I applied the patch on top of the one Matt gave earlier.
Machine booted with original tg3 which I rmmod'ed and then insmod'ed the 
new one (with Matt's and Rafael's patch) and then attempted a 
suspend-resume.
Is there a reason to try fresh boot with patched tg3 and without 
loading old module - I guess I will try that one later as well.
Thanks
Parag
