He shouldn't do research to find out what would be useful, just 
something of interest to him? He listed some areas in which he has an 
interest, he got a suggestion on where he look for a project, not a 
project description handed to him.

I agree that "pick something interesting, useful or not" is a part of 
the academic process, but I would never imply that it was a desirable 
thing. Asking for areas where work would be useful seems like valid 
research to me.
