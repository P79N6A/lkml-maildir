I use the third. The sucky thing is that I need to determine if
the kernel is 64-bit to know what I must load into the segment
register. Fortunately this code is not yet out in the wild, so
you can still fix the ABI situation for me at least.

Heh. I wish. Well, OK, but only because I detect the kernel!

I think that would be a lower chance, not a greater chance.
Reasons why an app might care:
a. identify a 64-bit kernel
b. far jumps between 32-bit and 64-bit code
c. reload of ds/es after a string operation on thread-private data
Perhaps i386 should change to match x86_64.
