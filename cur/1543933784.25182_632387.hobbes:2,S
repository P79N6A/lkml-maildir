Right. My point is that if monitoring *should* be working, and it isn't, then
you don't have a lot of reason to be 100% confident that those pins are working
either.  Unless there's two totally separate temperature sensors - otherwise,
if that sensor goes out, thermal monitoring and the emergency stuff *both*
break.
Of course, if somebody wise on the actual hardware design can definitively
state that even if the thermal sensor the monitoring uses dies, the chipset
will still thermal-throttle correctly, then I'd agree that the message could
go down to KERN_ERR or KERN_WARN.....
