As you might have guessed I have a multihead fetish, there are 3 PCI slots in
my machine, and I have 3 ISA card slots so that means a possible total of 6
monitors. I know that having ISA VGA, EGA and MDA all going at ones is not
going to happen, so it is probably more like a maximum of 4 monitors. I have
tried and I can fit them all on my desk at once, just need the support in the
kernel now.

As it stands I think there is a total of 6 drivers for S3 cards. Most of these
are being written for the Trio, I have not found a Virge fbdev driver that
works yet. I thought that writting one myself might teach me something, so far
it has. I am going to subscribe to the fbdev list and ask there again. I am
actually on the s3-fbdev list I think, but there has been no traffic for a
few months.
