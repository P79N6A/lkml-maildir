But if you are debugging problems with jiffies wrapping, wouldn't you
want to see the jiffies unmodified?  I understand your point, but the
tsc output (which I do prefer) seems to only be for the tsc (on x86),
and all else use jiffies (haven't looked at other archs). So debugging a
problem with jiffy wrap*, one would need to use something other than the
tsc, and then they would see the time the wrap occurred.
Also, the big number stands out more than the 3 zeros, so when I see
that, I know right away to go and change it back to use the tsc (since
my debugging usually needs higher resolutions).
