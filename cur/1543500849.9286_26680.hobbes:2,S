Hello,
Just to add my voice to the long list of people complaining about the 'attempt
to access beyond end of device' :
attempt to access beyond end of device
03:41: rw=0, want=538983757, limit=3152992
EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,65)): trunc_dindirect: Read failure, inode=501920,
block=538983756
EXT2-fs warning (device ide0(3,65)): ext2_free_blocks: bit already cleared for b
lock 2066620
EXT2-fs warning (device ide0(3,65)): ext2_free_inode: bit already cleared for in
ode 501920
lookup_by_inode: ino 501920 not found in tmp
find_fh_dentry: 03:41/501920 dir/501761 not found!
I was running 4 NFS iozones on my server (2.2.10-ac4 / knfsd 1.4.1) and
two of them failed on a 'no more space' (yes, I was missing a few Mb on the
server partition). Shortly after, the server seemed to be almost
irresponsive, and I saw tons of these bad access logs (not sure however
when they started to appear).
