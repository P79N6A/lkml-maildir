The point I'm making is that even if an application is "not optimized
for modern kernels" or whatever, there's no reason to ignore
inefficiencies. As Pierre Pfeiffer noted this happens independently of
user code. If a change can eliminate some CPU cycles and possible cache
activity, it would seem to be worth investigation.
The suggestion that the user code was inefficient was not mine...
Did I clarify it this time?
