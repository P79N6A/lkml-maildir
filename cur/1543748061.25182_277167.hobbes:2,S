Subject: status of via velocity in 2.6.9

How 'working' are the via velocity drivers in 2.6.9?
For better or worse, the cheapest gigabit card I could find has the 
vt6122 chip, which seems to want the velocity drivers. (*)
Unfortunately, while they (the driver and card, that is) seem at first 
to work fine, auto negotiating a gigabit connection with my hub, the 
network stops working after 5 ish minutes (could be function of bytes 
tx'ed as well, I guess). restarting the network (appart from a kernel 
upgrade, the box is redhat fc2) fixes the problem... for another 5 minutes.
Is this known behavior?
Thanks
Johan
(*) The card's box advertizes linux compatibility with RH 7.3 (2.4.18-3 
or later), which makes me wonder whether another driver may work better. 
  2.4.18-3 would seem to predate the via-velocity driver.
