Actually, I submitted a patch to Ingo, (and I guess it would also work
with Thomas' kthrt as well), that takes the nmi tick out of the timer
code completely (at least for x86) and moves it to the __do_IRQ.  This
way, it would detect when something is locked up with interrupts
disabled, but you don't worry about having the right timer configured
for it.
If you want to detect the timer being screwed up, that can be done on a
timer by timer basis, and most likely the soft lockup would find that
out too.
