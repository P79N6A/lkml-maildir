OK, I missed the !  (which is why I like !=0 because that avoids
single-char errors from ruinging things.)
That will work.
There's no race, since the for-each-device loop performs a pci_dev_get
which holds on to the device for the duration of the loop interior.
So doing a dev_get at any time inside the loop is sufficient; no
ordering is required.
(One of my original errors was assuming that I had to do a dev_put at the
bottom of the loop to counteract the for-each-device's get; but, no, 
this is not needed, the for-each-device loop performs a dev-put at 
the end of the loop, just as it does a dev_get for the next iteration.)
