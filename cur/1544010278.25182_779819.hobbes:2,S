I hope this driver independents on low level ALSA card implementation.
Because on some embedded machine, they don't use ASoC.
And I want to push this driver to upstream mainline finally.

Currently, because this sound playback is not very smooth. I guess
there some underrun when I write the USB audio data chuck to the card.
So maybe we need 2 buffers as a pingpang buffer  to do data buffering.
You know, vfs_write() is blocking operation and before it returns we
can not fill the buffer if you just have one buffer.
