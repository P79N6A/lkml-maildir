You'd prevent people from using valid working file systems in ways
that don't corrupt.
I think the logic we need is something like
	if drive_is_lba48 && controller_doesnt_do_lba48
		clip_capacity
as a variant of the current change. That covers the "no way" case. For
the others we need to check capacity requires lba48 && !dma_lba48
somewhere, probably ide_dma_check. That would make us drop out of DMA
for unsafe setups in a way that doesnt cause crashes or suprises and
still let everyone access the data properly.
