Why conform to something sub-optimal instead of changing it?
+ I was using ide_floppy_* in the new code to tag the areas that were
rewritten. Currently it doesn't look that optimistic since there are five
ide_floppy_* functions and fifty idefloppy_* ones but I'm hoping that this
statistics will improve after your patches. :)
