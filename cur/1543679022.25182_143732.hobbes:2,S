Whilst I agree with that in principle, it's inevitably expensive. Thus 
whilst we may need to have that code, we should try to avoid using it ;-)
The buddy allocator is obviously flawed in this department ... strategies
like allocating a 4M block to a process up front, then allocing out of that
until we're low on mem, then reclaiming in as large blocks as possible from
those process caches, etc, etc, would obviously help too. Though maybe
we're just permanently low on mem after a while, so it'd be better to just
group pagecache pages together ... that would actually be pretty simple to
change ... hmmm.
