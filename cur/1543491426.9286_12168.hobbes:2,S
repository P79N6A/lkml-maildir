      Here are a few comments on the v2.2.1 distribution. I don't know if
    it applies to v2.2.(2-5) versions. I haven't gotten there yet. :)
    A)
    The linux 2.2.1 distribution README is missing the comments on the
        symbolic links in /usr/include
            i.e.
                    cd /usr/include
                    rm -rf asm linux scsi
                    ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386 asm
                    ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/linux linux
                    ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/scsi scsi
Dangerous actions. You'll suddenly get lots of compilation errors.
And glibc 2.1 comes with its own scsi subdirectory.
