Wow, thanks for this link. It explains the details very well.

This was an attempt of (mdir z: with z: mapping to /dev/hdb4)
BTW, on the same day I bought this thing, "Linux" did demolish my only media.
But luckily I also bought a SB Live!, told the dealer, that I am running an

I got a different soundcard and a new ZIP media for no extra costs ;-)
