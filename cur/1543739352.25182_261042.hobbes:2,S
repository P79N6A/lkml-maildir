Are you saying that a minimal operating system should feel free to implement
select() to always return true with all bits set?

Like?
In the accept() case, you genuinely have a 'if you had substituted the
select() with an accept(), the accept() would have succeeded.'
In the UDP case, you do NOT have this situation. A recvmesg() in place
of select() would block, therefore, select() should not block.

We're talking about a packet that was never readable. If you had an
efficient enough check ahead of time (perhaps implemented in
hardware?), it would never get to the point where select() was in this
position. The Linux developer of this section of code decided that they
wanted UDP to be more efficient by delaying the checksum validation until
the last minute. The cost of this, is that they broke the API with regard
to select(). This isn't being admitted. Instead, off-topic challenges of
POSIX, and impractical claims regarding the use of blocking file descriptors
with select() being not recommended have been offered.
These answers are simply wrong. If the decision is to make select() with
blocking file descriptors unreliable, than the decision *IS* to recommend
that select() never be used with blocking file descriptors. What kind of
operating system developers would recommend the use of select() if it is
known that the behaviour is unreliable?

We're not talking about the future. Get off that horse.
We're talking about the present. At the time select() is invoked, there is
*no* available data. select() is lying.
