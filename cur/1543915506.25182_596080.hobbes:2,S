Is there a reason this needs to be a GFP flag versus a wrapper
around alloc_page/free_page ?  page_alloc.c is already too complicated
and it's better to keep new features separated. The only drawback
would be that free_pages would need a different call, but that
doesn't seem like a big problem.
Especially integrating it into slab would seem wrong to me.
slab is already too complicated and for users who need that
large areas page granuality rounding to pages is probably fine.
Also such a wrapper could do the old alloc_page_exact() trick:
instead of always rounding up to next order return the left over
pages to the VM. In some cases this can save significant memory.
I'm also a little dubious about your attempts to do vmalloc in
interrupt context. Is that really needed? GFP_ATOMIC allocations of
large areas seem to be extremly unreliable to me and not design. Even
if it works sometimes free probably wouldn't work there due to the
flushes, which is very nasty. It would be better to drop that.
