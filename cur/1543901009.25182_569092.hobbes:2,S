Ah yes, I remember reading about this automatic flushing thing. I don't
know how the caches actually work on most of our PPC's, but the fact is,
we don't have aliasing issues, so I can safely ignore it for a bit
longer :-)
There are some aliasing issues with the instruction cache specifically
on some 4xx models but that's irrelevant to this discussion (and I think
we handle them elsewhere anyway).
