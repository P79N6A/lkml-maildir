Edward Shushkin is working full-time on compression and encryption 
plugins for Reiser4, which are selected on a per file basis.  The 
compression and encryption is done at flush to disk time, rather than 
with each write, which means that repeated writes to the same object are 
done efficiently.  He has been working on it for a year, and sometime 
early next year he will have something usable you can try.:)
