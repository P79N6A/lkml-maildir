Sure.  Why wouldn't you be able to replace any component at all
or subsystem of the Linux kernel?
I can't see how they could co-exist in a single monolithic kernel
however.  If TCP/IP were available as a module you could unload
it, and load your module.  I can't remember if the TCP/IP stack
is modular, and can't visualize why one would want it modular
other than perhaps for development.
Or do you mean both coexisting in the same source tree, with
different filenames, or dir names?  I would think that they would
have namespace problems if used simulataneously if that is even
possible (which I doubt).
Why would you want to use an alternate stack? Or is it a
derivative of the existing stack?
