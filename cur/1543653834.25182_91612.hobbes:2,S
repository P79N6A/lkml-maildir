Yes, it does. I have a Radeon 9700 Pro, and I have been running XFree86
cvs to get 2d support. This has worked perfect for me. But yesterday ATI
launched their binary drivers, and I wanted to give them a try. Then I
had to get agp working. And after I got your mail, I thought everything
was going just fine. Everything loaded fine, but the computer locked up
everytime something 3d appeared. At this time I wasn't sure what I
should blame. The driver, og the agpgart. So I found my old Radeon
All-in-Wonder, with good DRI-support, and now it works perfect :)
So to make a long story short (too late), the agpgart seems to work
perfect, altough my Radeon 9700 Pro didn't.
