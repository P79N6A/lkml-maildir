What's important is not support lifetime, but whether or not the warning 
persists through version 4.1.2, 4.1.3, etc.
We don't want to add markers for compiler quirks that come and go.
The current markers tend to exist for a class of problems that gcc 
fundamentally has a tough time "seeing."  Different optimizer behaviors 
from compiler version to compiler version are just noise[1].
