Well, I *was* trying to be nice<vsg>.  I'd made the assumption that 
the supplier was the one doing the stealing, and that they (the cap 
makers as buyers of this cheaper than usual product) were not 100% 
aware of the problems at the time.  Yes, I've read the story, and the 
history of capacitor failures over the last 2 years does seem to lend 
considerable credance to the story.  When you are a CET, doing 
component level repairs for a living for the last 50 some years, some 
things do get your attention, and poor life of capacitors has long 
since become the single leading failure of things electronic, 
recently by a factor measured in magnitudes over anything else, like 
bad semiconductors.  Thats been the tend for the last 10 years in 
fact.  Poor lubrication of things basicly mechanical like electrical 
switches is now second on the list, with a lot of white space between 
them.
The windshield wiper speed switch in your car being a prime example of 
that 2nd type of failure.  If it hasn't miss-behaved, it will.  Pull 
the knob off the end of the stalk and remove the super sticky syrupy 
grease there and replace it with lubriplate, end of problem, probably 
forever.  Certainly for as long as you'll own it.  Your trivia fact 
for the day :-)
