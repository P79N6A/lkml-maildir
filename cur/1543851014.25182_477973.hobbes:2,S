David,
I guess the reasons for its less (or no) usage could be
1. These options are not documented in manpage
2. The usage is different from the general format of ptrace
3.  These are used for copying all the registers. Most applications will 
require data from a single addr/register at a time and can get this data 
from a specific register/address using PEEKTEXT or POKETEXT.
We could align these options with the general format of ptrace and then 
document in manpage mentioning the relevant kernel version
(like what we have for PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD in which kernel version is 
mentioned)
PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD (since Linux 2.4.6)
Thanks, Supriya
