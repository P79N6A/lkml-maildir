Subject: Zealous paging in 2.3.99-pre1

A number of memory management changes in 2.3.99-pre1 seem to wreak
havoc for me (esp. on "low-memory" systems), compared to 2.3.51.
"Problem": Qualitatively, the fraction of physical RAM allocated by the
I/O cache does NOT relinquish itself when user tasks demand memory.  It
won't drop to less than about 2/3 (!!) of the total amount of physical
memory, causing merciless swapping on lower-RAM systems.  
For example, simply opening 2 xterms, Netscape and GNU Emacs on a 32 MB
system causes the following situation:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         30364      29584        780          0        588      19660
-/+ buffers/cache:       9336      21028
Swap:        32764      13212      19552
Only 1/3 of the memory goes to "user" memory, i.e. minus buffers and
cache. The cached RAM allocation doesn't budge, grabbing 20 MB no matter
how hard you press the system. And the machine pages itself into the
ground, seemingly unnecessarily since there's _loads_ of physical RAM
sitting in the fs cache.  By comparison, 2.3.51 would free cache
pages until it was down to about 5 MB before it invoked kswapd with
any seriousness. 
This new behavior appears to persist through pre2-3. 
Anyone want to take a crack at this? Please? :) I'll gladly test any
suggested fixes or provide further system information off-list.
