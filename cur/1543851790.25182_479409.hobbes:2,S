I'm blind, didn't see you did it for them already :-)
Ok, your patch builds fine here. I can't test at the moment as I don't
have a machine at hand that has a device whose driver uses the ops in
iomap though, but I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work if it
builds, so as far as I'm concerned, that's good to go in 2.6.20.
(earlier if you wish but I won't submit the patch doing the powerpc
changes that makes me use those change before 2.6.20 obviously :-)
Cheers,
Ben.
