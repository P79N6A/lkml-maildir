Yeah, I think it's a a fear and uncertainly about the technical details about
the patch. That is why folks CC Ingo and company to get either a kind of
confirmation that this is ok along with comments. There are very few folks
that really understand the basic principals of the patch in this community
and that's not going to change any time soon. The mystery, paranoia (FUD)
and criticism surrounding it can make folks a bit shy.
I'll talk to you and Ben about it if we all get to OLS again. :)
