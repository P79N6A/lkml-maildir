This patch is not to fix this problem, but to minimize a bug in other 
modules (in this case I think it's in the serport module) and to keep 
the system working, at least to make a clean shutdown or terminate some 
important process cleanly.
This patch is in the mm_release that should return a null *mm anyway.
The bogus mm came from a pagefault in the do_exit function in 
kernel/exit.c that occured after the exit_mm call. This pagefault, in my 
case, come from a filp_close call that called tty_wakeup. I'm trying to 
identify this problem, but a pagefault like this may came from several 
different modules.
