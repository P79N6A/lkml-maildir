Hrmm. So how is this going to work with suspend and resume?
Ideally, on resume we want to update the clock before interrupts are
reenabled so we don't get stale time values post-resume.  For systems
that sleep on reading the persistent clock, I'm open to having them
fix it up as best they can later (partly why the code can handle
read_persistent_clock() not returning anything), but unless I'm
misreading this, it seems you're proposing to make systems that do
have a safe persistent clock have to have the window where code may
see the pre-suspend time after resume.
Am I missing something here?
thanks
