Actually, if this field were to be added, I think it would be far better
to have it be NULL in the case where there is no ID which can be
expected to remain the same on insert/remove. Otherwise we might have
people getting very confused when someone removes device A and adds
device B and they end up with the same "unique id" because neither one
has a real unique id.
