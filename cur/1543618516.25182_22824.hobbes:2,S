Subject: 2.5.3-pre5 - Configurator updates

Due to a private flame-war about configuration options and behaviour, I
just broke down and did the thing I had asked for from others for a long
time - split up the huge unwieldly "Configure.help" file into many smaller
ones that are closer to the option they describe.
The split was largely automated, with one 25-thousand line file being
split up into almost 100 smaller files. The placement was also entirely
automated, and basically moved each entry to the same subdirectory where
the config question for that entry was located (and if the question was
duplicated over several places, the help was duplicated too).
This should make it _much_ easier to have things like per-architecture
config entries that the rest of the world simply doesn't want to know
about and has no interest in.
[ The automated nature of the split also showed that some questions are
  sometimes oddly placed. Some minimal movement was done to fix the worst
  offenders, but hopefully we can organize some of it more logically in
  the future. ]
However, I would ask that maintainers of config tools, drivers and
architectures would check that their config help entries still exist, and
seem to work. Of the tools, only the basic "make config" script has been
updated to know about the change in location, so menuconfig/xconfig simply
will not find the help right now.
Oh, non-x86 architectures probably need to fix up their config menu
entries too, as I only did a minimal "move architecture-common entries to
init/Config.in" edit (to not duplicate all the questions/help messages
that are common to all architectures), and I'm absolutely positive that
the menu structure didn't move correctly.
Other changes tend to get overwhelmed in the patch (happily it's not every
day that you clean up the largest file in the whole archive), but
ChangeLog appended so you can see what else happened.
