Yeah :-(  In the good old days there was a physical jumper you had to move
before flash'ing could take place.  My video card, for example, has a jumper
which is very awkward to access.  However, in the cause of luser-friendliness
(oh no, never open the machine, never change a jumper) the manufacturers
have moved away from this physical protection to protection-by-obscurity
(which as we all know is effectively zero protection at all).
Because, as you say, iopl can be used to access hardware directly, it becomes
a lot harder to protect your hardware, but this shouldn't stop us trying.
