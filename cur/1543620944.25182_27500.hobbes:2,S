If the network driver supports querying of the MII registers (usually done with
the private ioctl stuff) then you can query the link beat from userspace.
Depending on the driver/chip this may be a very fast query, or it may take
upwards of 100us with interrupts disabled.
I can post example code if you like...
Now what I would *really* like to see would be a way to get asynchronous
notification of userspace processes on link beat change.   Of course, depending
on NIC this would require an interrupt handler or a kernel thread periodically
checking the link state, as well as some way to pass that information to the
user (netlink socket, interrupt...not sure what the best would be).
