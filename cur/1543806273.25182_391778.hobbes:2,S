It might, but it's also rather ugly to have two pieces of code, 
especially in the presence of very dynamic partitions.  In other words, 
if the kernel deals with partitions, you want to be able to get at the 
kernel's view of partitions, not necessarily the actual set of 
partitions on disk, which can be quite different.
