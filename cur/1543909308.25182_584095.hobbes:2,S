If it makes sense for the driver it has to make sense
for the platform too. If not it cannot run the driver
(which might be fine; a lot of architectures only
run their own specialized drivers)

The difference between the low dma allocation and GFP_DMA32 is that
the low dma allocation zone is isolated. This means it is not shared
with user pages, no LRU, no vmscan, no try_to_free_pages etc.
But that cannot be obviously done for a full 4GB, only for a small
area.  Right now on swiotlb systems we reserved 82MB for this
(64MB swiotlb + 16MB ZONE_DMA). So the new zone is by default <100MB
and can afford to be isolated.
If GFP_DMA32 was merged into the mask allocator then it would
need to learn about all that mess by itself. If GFP_DMA32
stays it can just use the current page allocator which avoids
a lot of code duplication.
The DMA allocator calls the normal page allocator implicitely
though for a 4GB mask, but that still needs such a bit to specify.
