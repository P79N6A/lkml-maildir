At least, inputattach should only recalibrate if asked for that. POS
*users* are not very computer-skilled (typically, at least over here)
and even automated recalibration (ie. the cashier software forces it
because it detects that the user presses besides the actual images) are
kind of stress to them...

The problematic part is that this needs to be done at a quite low level,
since POS keyboards may send quite a lot more than make/break codes in
"proper" order...

...and especially this problem can be better solved by reprogramming the
MCR readers :-)
