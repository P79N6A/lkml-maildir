Just enable slab debugging and all of that goes away and you get the usual 
error messages. Otherwise slub tries to compress the memory use as much as 
possible. The advantage here is that you can add an abitrary amount of 
kmem_cache_create() without increasing memory use significantly. Its cheap 
to do kmem_cache creations. Thus you can create open arbitrary caches not 
worrying about memory use and have meaningful variables on which you do 
kmem_cache_alloc instead of kmalloc/kfree. kmalloc/kfree wastes space 
since they go to powers of two. And kmalloc/kfree have to calculate the
cache at runtime whereas kmem_cache_alloc/free does the lookup once.
The amount of per cpu stuff we keep around that is idle is reduced by 50%. 
Increasing cpu cache usage and reduces memory footprint. per cpu stuff 
has to hold per cpu reserves and it is not good to waste too much memory 
there.
nfsd4_delegations? What is this about?
How do I scan for the symlinks in sysfs?
