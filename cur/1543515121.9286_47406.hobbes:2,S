  Hi, all. Version 135 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
NOTE: this patch removes more compatibility entries. If you need the
compatibility entries, install devfsd-v1.2.10 which will create them
automatically if you ask.
This is against 2.3.25. Highlights of this release:
- Removed compatibility entries for virtual console capture devices
- Removed unused <devfs_set_symlink_destination>
- Removed compatibility entries for serial devices
- Removed compatibility entries for console devices
- Do not hide entries from devfsd or children
- Removed DEVFS_FL_TTY_COMPAT flag
- Removed "nottycompat" boot option
- Removed <devfs_mk_compat>
				Regards,
					Richard....
