I think so, yes.  One makes it clear that we're talking about allowing
user (somethings :), one might just as well mean "this is a user mount."

Yes, if it weren't too long it would by far have been my preference.

in the time I go from quitting the manpage to foregrounding my editor, I
may have already forgotten which was which.
