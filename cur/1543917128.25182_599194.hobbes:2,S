Hi Balbir,
Thank for your review, hopefully I addressed all your items in this
series.

Yes, as you saw there is this dependency, it is needed only for
[PATCH 7/8] taskstats: fix stats->ac_exitcode to work on threads and use group_exit_code
but I found it simpler to put the calls in the right order from the
beginning.
Thanks again, and sorry for the double mail bomb.
