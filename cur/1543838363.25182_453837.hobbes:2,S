Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake and missed a path. Maybe it would be
better to fix if by making isdn_writebuf_skb_stub() always set the skb
to NULL when it does free it. That would add a few more assignments
but should ensure the right result always.
What do you say?

A rewrite would be beyond me, but I try to clean up bits and pieces...
