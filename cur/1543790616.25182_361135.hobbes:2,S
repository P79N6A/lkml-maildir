I have no problems with submitting 1.17.38 EF for inclusion upstream.
My only hope is that for the (other) 2100 user out there that use the
latest 2100 firmware and are not experiencing problems, the downgrade
does not break anything.
That's another reason I posed the following question:

Perhaps I should also ask:
	Who's running 2100 cards with the latest qla2xxx driver and
	are experiencing no problems?
