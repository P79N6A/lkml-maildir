Thanks very much Nish!
I've updated the patches here 
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/dyn-ticks/
 with 
the latest change to timer_pm.c that Srivatsa sent me and have a new rollup 
there as well as the split out patches. The ball is in Nish's court now so 
we'll avoid touching the code till you get back to us (this project needs 
some form of locking ;) ).
Cheers,
Con
