The patch deletes a pile of custom code from configfs and replaces it with
calls to standard kernel infrastructure and fixes a shortcoming/bug in the
process.  Migration over to the new interface is trivial and almost
scriptable.
Nice patch.  What's not to like about it??

To do what?  Fix the artificial PAGE_SIZE contraint?  The patch would be
justified on cleanup grounds even if nobody was hitting that limit.
