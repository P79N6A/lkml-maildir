Retested this compile error with todays 2.6.23-rc1+git, still the same.

Hmm. Just make works, make bootimage does not. I debugged this further 
today and I can not see how it can work.
The link command in question is
ld   -static -uvsprintf -T   arch/alpha/boot/bootloader.lds arch/alpha/boot/head.o arch/alpha/boot/main.o -o arch/alpha/boot/bootloader
and it still tells
arch/alpha/boot/bootloader.lds:25: undefined symbol `srm_printk' referenced in expression
arch/alpha/boot/bootloader.lds contains a single related line referring 
to srm_printk:
printk = srm_printk;
This only seems to define an alias to srm_printk so not important (and 
unused)?
nm arch/alpha/boot/head.o outputs
0000000000000000 T __start
0000000000000108 T halt
0000000000000110 T move_stack
                 U start_kernel
0000000000000060 T switch_to_osf_pal
0000000000000100 T tbi
0000000000000020 T wrent
0000000000000040 T wrkg
so no mention of srm_printk.
nm arch/alpha/boot/main.o outputs
                 U _end
                 U callback_close
                 U callback_getenv
                 U callback_open
                 U callback_read
0000000000000000 G hwrpb
0000000000000000 T pal_init
0000000000000000 b pcb_va
                 U srm_printk
0000000000000130 T start_kernel
                 U strcpy
                 U switch_to_osf_pal
and the U srm_printk is breaking things. main.c actually uses srm_printk 
inside so it really needs to link one in. I do not see where that 
srm_printk could come from? The only implementation seems to be in 
arch/alpha/lib/srm_printk.c that goes into arch/alpha/lib/lib.a.. maybe 
this is forgotten?
arch/alpha/boot/Makefile contains different link rules for bootloader vs 
bootpheader and bootpzheader - the others also have $(LIBS_Y). However, 
as trial and error showed, adding $(LIBS_Y) to get lib/lib.a does not 
work - I got new unresolved symbols (__kmalloc or some other malloc 
variant).
So, can anyone guide me further - where should srm_printk come from in 
bootloader image?
