This looks like it could take the msecs_to_jiffies() conversion as well.
Might as well cache it before the if/else, as both clauses use it?
Really, it is just wait_event*() without the wait-queue. Well, this is
at least one more consumer potentially of the poll_event*() API I had
written a while back, I'll dust it off again if I have the time.

msecs_to_jiffies().

With the changes you've already made, that should clean up the sleeping
code a bit, at least.
