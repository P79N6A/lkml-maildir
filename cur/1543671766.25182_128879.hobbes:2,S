Could you explain to me how this is any more off-topic than the whole 
DRM thread?  I don't want to be a jerk about it, but my original 
statement was directly in response to McVoy's ostensive assertion (as 
interpreted by some people) that open source developers don't do 
anything innovative whereas commercial vendors do.
So, was I off topic?  Within the realm of the whole DRM discussion we've 
been having, I don't think so.  Was the whole DRM discussion off-topic? 
  Probably, and I apologize for adding to it.  I will move on to more 
relevant topics.
