How can I know ? Is there a sign in the executable itself ?

How could I know ? I don't have any process called 'bdflush', neither program file
with that name, just a man(8) entry.

What's wrong with it ? pgcc, egcs, gcc which are they ? Here, at home, I'm running a Mandrake 6.1
and 'gcc --version' reports 'pgcc-2.91.66'.

didn't forward it. Shame on them.
