Uless of course you need to debug the serial driver -- then you're

It works today, but won't in the future.  At some point, real sleep
locks will be needed for SMP tuning since you can give them prioities
and put deadlock detection into the sleep locks for apps.  Priority
inheritance allows you to bump the priority of folks holding a bunch of
sleep locks so they release them more quickly.  SCO Unix uses them and
that's why it's TCP-C numbers are almost 5 times what Linux's are with a
database.  You'll need them to keep Linux competitive when Caldera ships
their SCO Unix version.
