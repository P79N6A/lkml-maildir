I was playing with an old irix cd that I couldn't mount at first.
people told me that there have been some changes lately in the kernel
regarding cd's etc. 
anyways.
mout -t efs /dev/sr0 /cdrom didn't work and what _did_ work, was 
mount -t efs /dev/sr0 /cdrom -o loop or something along the line. I
could ls the cd fine.
there was a RELEASE.INFO on the cd so let's take a look at it.
oops. bad idea :
root 7429  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?   SW<  13:02   0:00 [loop0]
root 7439  0.0  0.0  1652  712 ?   D    13:04   0:00 less RELEASE.info
root 7445  0.0  0.1  1800  972 ?   D    13:04   0:00 file RELEASE.info
so the cdrom can't be umounted; I can't kill the processes.
is this a bug, or supposed to be this way ? :-)
