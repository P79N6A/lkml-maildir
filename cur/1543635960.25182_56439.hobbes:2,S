Joe, 
I assure you this is not LVM1.  I have both tools installed, but they are 
under different directories, and my test scripts call them with full paths.  
I have also done some tracing to verify I am in device-mapper code.  Also, 
the kernel I tested with has only device mapper and evms, no lvm1.
