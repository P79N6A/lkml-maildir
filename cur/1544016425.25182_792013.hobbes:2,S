That's not completely true. I can't speak for Christoph, but the
biggest problem I have is that I have _no way_ of reproducing or
analyzing the regression. I've tried out various benchmarks I have
access to but I haven't been able to find anything.
The hypothesis is that SLUB regresses because of kmalloc()/kfree()
ping-pong between CPUs and as far as I understood, Christoph thinks we
can improve SLUB with the per-cpu alloc patches and the freelist
management rework.
Don't get me wrong, though. I am happy you are able to work with the
Intel engineers to fix the long standing issue (I want it fixed too!)
but I would be happier if the end-result was few simple patches
against mm/slub.c :-).

If you ask me, I wish we *had* removed SLAB so relevant people could
have made a huge stink out of it and the regression would have been
taken care quickly ;-).
