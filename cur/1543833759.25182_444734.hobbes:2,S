Thanks Adrian. I have put this in my tree and made an additional change 
along the same lines (your patched introduced an unused function warning 
to the non-debug build). If Ulrich signifies acceptance, I will send 
this on to John.
I have also sent in a patch to add a MAINTAINERS entry for zd1211rw, in 
hope that this will help you send patches with myself and/or Ulrich CC'd 
in future :)
Thanks.
Daniel
