Your config looks fine so it must be some ACPI change that affected
IRQ routing. If IRQ's not being delievered AT keyboard probe will time
out. You said that it broke between 2.6.20 and 2.6.20-rc2.. Have you
tried -rc1?

Tha happens because actual keyboard/mouse probing is offloaded to
kseriod thread so nothing happens untul it actually gets scheduled.
