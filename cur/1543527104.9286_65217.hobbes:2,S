Well this sure looks strange after 32,xxx network connections and
subsequent disconnects. This is an embeded system.

I think 300 should be changed to the 'lowest next-available'.
There really isn't any 'daemon-area'. Many/most daemons spawn
children to do their work. The 'kids' that are actually doing
the work can have any pid, except 1 and less than max.
Cheers,
