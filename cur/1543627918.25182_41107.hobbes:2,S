Something like that.  
We already have a hierarchy of degrees of saving:
 1. live state - the state of a program's data, possibly extended by
    undo/redo features.
 2. file - saved file, possibly extended by features like emacs'
    "file.c~"
 3. revision - revision checked into some revision control system
 4. checkpoint or tag - revision branded with a symbolic name in a
    revision control system
I am envisioning a richer version of the file stage.  Just as users
currently decide when to check in a version and when to checkpoint
versions, I am imagining that sort of decision would still be made,
but there would be a lower level of granularity that could be looked
at if desired.  Big infrequent changes to a file would all be
recorded, and frequent little changes would be subject to some
heuristic.  It doesn't make sense to record a file's state so often
that it isn't even self-consistent.  For example, recording all the
changes over the course of the save of a big Star Office drawing would
be silly, most would be intermediate and dependent on the changing
epheneral internal state of Star Office.  I don't know the details of
a reasonable heuristic other than obvious things such as when a file
of flushed or closed or not touched for some significant time.

Writing an editor to take advantage of such underlying features would
be pretty interesting too, it could be integrated into undo/redo
features.  
Navigating such an historical fabric turns into a really interesting
user interface problem.

I think change sets for source code would still be based on versions
declared by a human to be of some specific interest.  But changes sets
for a computer's configuration might be implicit in the running of rpm
or chkconfig, or reboots of the system, or saved edits to
configuration files.  Etc.
Certainly what I am envisioning would have immediate use in looking at
changes to specific files, but would require more structure imposed to
be useful a system configuration management tool or source code
control system.
I do point out that recently Microsoft announced some sort of feature
to let users backout system changes.  It sounds useful to me and I run
Linux, but should that have some basic system support and not be
kludged in?  (For example, such a feature could be added to rpm, but
it would only be good at capturing things done by rpm.)  Would a
versioning filesystem be part of doing it the right way?
