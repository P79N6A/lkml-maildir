Furthermore, keeping track of these allocations will mean that you
/ALWAYS/ rack up the overhead of keeping track of this, even though
most machines probably won't run out of memory ever, or no more

OOM is a very rare situation and as long as you don't do something
that's really a bad surprise to the user, everything should be ok.
