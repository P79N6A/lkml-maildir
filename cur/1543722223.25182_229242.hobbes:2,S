I have been trying to get some platforms to work with a quad port
Ethernet card.
Some hardware is OK, others...well, not so OK.
An IBM x335 works OK under Linux (2.4.9) and Win2K3
An IBM x365 Does not work under Linux.
Looks like Linux shares an IRQ between all 4 ports whereas win2k3
doesn't .... each is assigned it's own IRQ.  Is there anyway to
duplicate this behavior under Linux? (i.e. have an IRQ assigned to each
port instead of sharing one for the whole card?).
Thanks,
