Subject: i2c on alpha - used but not available in 2.6.3

Are i2c drivers valid on alpha?
They are not available because drivers/i2c/Kconfig (nor drivers/Kconfig
which includes it) is not included from arch/alpha/Kconfig.
But many drivers making use of i2c can be enabled - and build with
unresolved symbols (about 50 warnings - mostly in media/video drivers).
I checked that adding including of drivers/i2c/Kconfig to arch/alpha/Kconfig
everything build and all remaining unresolved symbols fade away.
