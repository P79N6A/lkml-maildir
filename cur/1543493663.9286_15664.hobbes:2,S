Hello,
Something strange happened when I upgraded the kernel from 2.0.36 to 2.2.6:
The disk geometry as seen by lilo, fdisk, etc is now changed, and these
utilities can not be used any more without making the system unbootable.
In order to use them I have to boot 2.0.36 from a floppy, make the
changes and reboot 2.2.6.
The disk is an Wide SCSI Seagate ST19171W, and is seen by 2.0.36 with
1106 cylinders, and by 2.2.6 with 8683 cylinders.
The same software upgrade worked fine on all the systems around, except
the ones with this type of disks. 
Anybody has any clues what's going on? Is there any way, other than
repartitioning the disk and reinstalling the software, to make the
system consistent?
Please send comments to florin@andrew.cmu.edu.
Thank you,
Florin
