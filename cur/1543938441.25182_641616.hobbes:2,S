i'd _love_ to have this approach instead of the assembly routines. While 
'constructing pagetables' might not look like a big deal in isolation - 
C is still 10 times more programmable than assembly. Pushing more of the 
early boot code into a sane, non-assembly environment will have positive 
long-term effects all across.
