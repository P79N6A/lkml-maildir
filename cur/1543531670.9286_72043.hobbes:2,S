Okay.  I've decided that my journey down memory lane will not be alone.
I have been the unfortunate soul to inherit an old Compaq 386 (100MB HD)
with Interactive Systems' Interactive UNIX on it.  It's one of the true
Unixes complete with names stamped on it like Microsoft, AT&T, and
Interactive Systems on it.  Don't get me wrong, in it's day (1986) it was
great.
However, I am needing to mount the drive under Linux.  I've searched for
over 7-8 hours all over the net, kernel documentation, etc, but am unable
to get the drive to mount.
Fdisk identifies it as partition type 0x63, which it says is GNU HURD,
however, the official partition table on the net shows that 0x63 is System
V, which is correct with the OS.
Now comes my dilemma, I think I might be dealing with System V Release 2's
filesystem, which I see on the System V FS website is not supported on hard
disk (only superblocks 1, 9, and 15 are supported which are floppy).
I've tried enabling all forms of UFS and SYSV file systems, with the
appropriate -o ufstype=(whatever) options to mount, and I still get a bad
superblock type error message.
The old host OS for the drive is System V 3.2/3 (which is release 3, I
believe).
HELP! (TIA)
Jim
