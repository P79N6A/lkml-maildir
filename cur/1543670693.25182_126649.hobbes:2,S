I have been working on a new version of the IPMI driver.  It's actually
not terribly different than the old version (no functional or interface
differences), but has the following differences:
    * It will properly parse ACPI tables to find IPMI interfaces (the
      old driver had some ACPI parsing code, but it was broken).
    * It supports a SMIC interface.
    * It has a socket interface to IPMI.
I'm putting it out for people to beat on, so have at it!
You can get it from SourceForge at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/openipmi/,
 under "Experimental Driver". 
There are 2.5.68 and 2.4.20 versions.
