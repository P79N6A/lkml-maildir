	From a previous discussion, I understand that there are some
PCI bus parisc machines without consistent memory.

	That would result in big rarely used branches in device
drivers or lots of ifdef's and the equivalent.  With James's approach,
porting a driver to support those parisc machines (for example) would
involve sprinkling in some calls to macros that would compile to
nothing on the other machines.
	Compare the code clutter involved in allowing those
inconsistent parisc machines to run, say, the ten most popular
ethernet controllers and the four most popular scsi controllers.  I
think the difference in the resulting source code size would already
be in the hundreds of lines.
