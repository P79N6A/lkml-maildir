Ok so you have different irqs sharing vectors, how does this work with the
following (where $vector really means $irq of course)?
.data
ENTRY(interrupt)
.text
vector=0
ENTRY(irq_entries_start)
.rept NR_IRQS
        ALIGN
1:      pushl $vector-256
        jmp common_interrupt
Also i was thinking about when you exhaust all 200 odd
spare vectors and then end up doing set_intr_gate twice on the same
vector? I may be missing something really obvious here.
Thanks
