Difficult apart from what you're already describing. The interesting point is 
the waiting for something that makes it hang, which reminds me of the 
parent-child waiting problem and is likely to be similar. The thing about iso 
tasks is they are by definition always active so they always get reinserted 
into the active array. However if they are waiting for something and are 
constantly preempting that something it will never happen. Can you try the 
attached diff which always puts them on the expired array if they run out of 
timeslice to see if that helps? This is not the ideal fix, but I need to see 
if it is the problem.
