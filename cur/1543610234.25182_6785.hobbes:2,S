Some more corrections are needed, and many thanks to Russell King for
assisting me in finding them, and for providing access to a system in
order to debug these issues.
(1) prevent integer overflow in FEASIBLE()
(2) prevent integer overflow in ENDS_ABOVE()
(3) test for !segment_contains_point(optimum, goal)
	in __alloc_bootmem_core() as an additional condition under
	which the the goal should be discounted as a possible starting
	address for the returned interval. The symptom seen without
	the test is an interval that wraps around ULONG_MAX
This patch tested on ARM.
Cheers,
Bill
