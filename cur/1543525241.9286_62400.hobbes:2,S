Filesystems without capabilities will exist for a _long_ time, and
people will want to be able to use them for setuid root programs. How
about diskless clients mounting their root filesystem over NFS?

As Matthew points out, that doesn't work since it affects all
processes, not just setuid processes. 
I haven't really figured out what the bounding set is for. It doesn't
seem to do anything that couldn't be done trivially by using wrappers
in inittab to remove capabilities from the inheritable set a la Irix.
And I'm puzzled by the capabilities given to init. Why doesn't init
run with all capabilites? cap_setpcap is a subset of cap_sys_admin
(because of mknod and /dev/kmem) so I see no point in not making
setpcap inheritable from init.

The whole lot, so we get the old behaviour for setuid root back.

The behaviour of the inheritable capabilities when doing setuid
emulation changes the assumptions that setuid programs are allowed to
make - setuid root programs are expected to be capability aware.
This makes me very nervous since it is impossible to analyse what the
possible consequences of this are without reading the source to every
setuid root program. I would be much happier if setuid emulation
accurately implemented the traditional behaviour of setuid root since
that brings us back to the status quo. It may not be ideal, but it
doesn't introduce any extra problems.
I haven't come up with an example of an exploit involving the
inheritable capabilities, but I can say where I would start looking.
Choose a program that uses more than two uids as part of its operation
(ie. your uid, 0, and something else). Queuing systems are good
candidates. I'll pick exim (an MTA). Run it with cap_setgid+i and
cap_setuid-i. (IME, programs check the return value from initgroups
but don't check for setuid; exim is no exception.) Now check in /proc
which uids exim is running with. Oops - it's running as root when it
shouldn't be.

Solving the theoretical problems makes the design secure.
Solving the practical problems make the design usable.
It is in the nature of security holes that code is pushed beyond the
limits of what the author expected. Assuming that certain input data
will never happen is likely to lead to security holes, therefore you
should consider problems that you consider merely 'theoretical'.
Only looking at practical problems will tell you a lot about the API,
but will tell you little about how secure the design is.
