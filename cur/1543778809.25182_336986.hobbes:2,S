usually this is configurable.  So, you can configure you BIOS to use
acpi to handle hot-plug, or you can allow the OS to handle it.  Most
OS (from what I hear) don't actually implement native hotplug support,
so native hotplug support is probably not as big a priority for bios
writers as the acpi support.  so, it doesn't surprise me to find some
that don't support native.
you can run the native hotplug driver on a system who's bios supports
acpi - if it provides the OSHP method, this tells the bios to allow
the OS to handle it.

i'm trying to gain a grip myself, as i've just started learning about
pcie :).  someone else hopefully will correct me if i'm telling you
the wrong info.
