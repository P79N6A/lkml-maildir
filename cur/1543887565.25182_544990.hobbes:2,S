I removed the people I didn't think needed to be on the Cc list any more,
since I was changing the direction of the thread.

No, it does matter.  Your suggestion doesn't work, because
/sys/module/scsi_mod/parameters/ belongs to the module code.  To create
a new attribute there, you use the module_param() code -- and there's
no way to have code called when your parameter is changed.

You're claiming that 0.7 second (I just timed it on a 3 year old
laptop) *inconveniences* you?

This whole thing is such a tempest in a teapot.  I really don't
understand why you care so much.
