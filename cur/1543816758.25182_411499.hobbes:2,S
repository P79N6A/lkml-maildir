So for planning purposes.  I don't think we can even if we ignore sysctl
and proc have an implementation that we all agree is stable and safe
before 2.6.17 merge window closes.  I do think if we get our act
together something that works and is tested when the 2.6.18 window
opens is very reasonable.  (Limited to UTS and sysvipc with other work
waiting until later).
Does that sound like a reasonable and achievable goal?
