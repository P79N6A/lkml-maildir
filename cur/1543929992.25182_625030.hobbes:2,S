Dave and I are both a bit stubborn on this point. I've been meaning to
respin those patches..

Yes. My plan is to change the interface from SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM to
add_network_entropy. The SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM interface sucks because it
doesn't tell the core what kind of source it's dealing with.

I'm well aware of that. We'd use get_cycles() exclusively, but it
returns zero on lots of platforms. We used to use sched_clock(), I
can't remember why that got changed.

Because I'm the /dev/random maintainer and it's considered the polite
thing to do, damnit.
