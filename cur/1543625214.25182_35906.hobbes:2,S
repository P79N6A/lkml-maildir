Well... In fact, i am really worried about stability, but i don't have much 
choice on the configuration. I have to choose between this config
and a dual 2.0 Ghz Xeon (RDRAM) which has roughtly the same perfs,
but which is 50% more expensive !
 Do you have pointers  showing stability problems when using
XP processor in a multiprocessor context ?
The Athlon actually crashes as soon as I start X with the nvidia board if i 
don't use the mem=nopentium option.
With a Matrox G450, i don't need this option...

I've juste tested an Intel e1000 on it and achieved 900 Mbits/s with ttcp....
So i guess it works... I do some nfs benches right now to see if i can
reach the disk transfer limit (around 40 Mo/s for sequencial acces on a big 
file).
