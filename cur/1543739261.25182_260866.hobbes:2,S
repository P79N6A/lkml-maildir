The problem is that this would imply that the console would only
work after user space is running. Even with initrd that's quite late.
The only way I see to make that fly would be a very good early 
console implementation, otherwise tracking down any problems will
be hell (how do you display "panic no rootfs found" without console?) 
And writing a good early console implementation would have all the
same problems as the current one.
So I can see Kendall's point.
