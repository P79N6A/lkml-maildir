yes, lockdep will warn about this. Will you /ever/ have a B->C or C->B 
dependency without A being taken first?
if not then my suggestion would be to just lump 'B' and 'C' into a 
single lock - or to get rid of them altogether. There's little reason to 
keep them separate. /If/ you want to keep them separate (because they 
protect different data structures) then it's the cleanest design to have 
an ordering between them. The taking of 'A' might go away anytime - such 
a construct is really, really fragile and is only asking for trouble.
