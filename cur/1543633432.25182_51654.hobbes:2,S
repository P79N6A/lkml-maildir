In the USB case, the "something" represents a device, and the "dma_buffer" is 
something you want to send-to / receive-from the device.
kmallocing the transfer buffers is a problem for suspend. Doing the "you get 
the transfer buffer with the device" is really useful, because you know that 
the device configuration will be returned. But we might need to re-init the 
device after a suspend, and [I've been told that] memory allocation may 
deadlock under these circumstances.
Would it be enought to move the transfer buffers to the start of the device 
struct, and then pad it up to a cacheline?
