Well, check code in fs/splice.c, function splice_to_pipe().
If SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK is not set, it is *expected* to block on pipe.
In this mode, only another thread is able to drain the pipe and wakeup the blocked thread.
Code review :
When all pages are used "if (pipe->nrbufs == PIPE_BUFFERS)"
                if (spd->flags & SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK) {
                        if (!ret)
                                ret = -EAGAIN;
                        break;
                }
                if (signal_pending(current)) {
                        if (!ret)
                                ret = -ERESTARTSYS;
                        break;
                }
                if (do_wakeup) {
                        smp_mb();
                        if (waitqueue_active(&pipe->wait))
                                wake_up_interruptible_sync(&pipe->wait);
                        kill_fasync(&pipe->fasync_readers, SIGIO, POLL_IN);
                        do_wakeup = 0;
                }
                pipe->waiting_writers++;

I would say, use the SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK flag on splice() system call,
but let tcp socket in blocking mode... But with current kernel it
wont work. In order to avoid busy looping, you might add a poll()/select()
to call splice(SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK) only when socket has data
in its receive queue.
for (;;) {
	struct pollfd pfd;
	pfd.fd = socket;
	pfd.events = POLLIN;
	if (poll(&pfd, 1, -1) != 1)
		continue;
	res = splice(socket, NULL, pipefds[1], NULL, 65536, SPLICE_F_MOVE|SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK);
	if (res > 0)
		nwritten = splice(pipefds[0], NULL, file_fd, NULL, res, SPLICE_F_MOVE|SPLICE_F_MORE);
}
splice() from tcp socket to pipe is not working as is unfortunatly if !SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK)
and if using the same thread to write and read the pipe. Or risk deadlock.
