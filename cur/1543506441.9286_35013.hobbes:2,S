I've never heard anyone use playte, etc. without reference to the Jargon
file. It's more obscure than olde English. Secondly, VAXen, which were
32-bit, still maintained the usage of word for 16 bits even though
'machine word' is usually defined as the register size. They had
longwords, quadwords, and octawords as well.
