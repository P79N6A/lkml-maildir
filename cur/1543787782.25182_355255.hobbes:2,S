 martin, i'm going to take a leaf from the great rusty russell's book,
 because i was very impressed with the professional way in which he
 dealt with someone who posted such immature and out-of-line comments:
 he rewrote them in a much more non-hostile manner and then replied to
 that.
 so, here goes: i'm copying the above few [relevant] paragraphs
 below, then rewriting them, here:

 martin, hi, thank you for responding.
 well... actually, as it turns out, the l4linux and l4ka people have
 already done most of the work!!
 i believe you may have missed part of my message (it was a bit long, i
 admit) and i thank you for the opportunity, that your message presents,
 to reiterate this: l4linux _exists_ - last time i checked (some months
 ago) it had a port of 2.6.11 to the L4 microkernel.
 so, in more ways than one, no i am of course not expecting people to
 just take orders from someone as mad as myself :)
 i really should reiterate this: i _invite_ people to _consider_ the
 direction that processor designs - not just any "off-the-wall"
 processor designs but _mainstream_ x86-compatible processor designs -
 are likely to take.  and they are becoming more and more parallel.
 the kinds of questions that the experienced linux kernel
 maintainers and developers really need to ask is: can the
 present linux kernel design _cope_ with such parallelism?
 is there an easier way?
 that's mainly why i wished you "good luck" :)
 l.
 p.s. martin.  _don't_ do that again.  i don't care who you are:
 internet archives are forever and your rudeness will be noted
 by google-users and other search-users - long after you are dead.
