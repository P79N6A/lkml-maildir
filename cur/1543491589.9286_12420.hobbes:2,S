I'm not a member of the list, so please reply to either of the
addresses on this email. I've searched through the list archives
to no avail.
I am EXTREMELY interested in the development of the frame buffer
stuff in the kernel, but have not been able to get responses from
any of the email addresses in Documentation/fb/*.txt.  I can see
that development is going on, but I don't know where to look for
a changelog or anything.  I would presume that there are
different groups for each fb device (atafb/matroxfb/vesafb).  If
anyone could put me in the direction of vesafb & fbcon people, I
would be GREATLY appreciative.
