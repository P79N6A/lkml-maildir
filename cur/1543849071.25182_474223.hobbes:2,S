This patch can't fix anything, sorry for the confusion.
Yes, the 'if (new_sigh) {}' code in sys_unshare() is broken, but it is
never executed, because unshare_sighand() never populates new_sighp.
Probably it is better to just remove this code.

Oh, but it is silly to take the global tty_mutex in do_task_stat().
Why do we need it if ->siglock protects ->signal->tty ? We are only
reading the tty_struct, tty->driver can't go away ...
