Thanks for the suggestion, but booting is fine.

/dev/sda2 is / under 2.4
/dev/sda3 is /mnt/target under 2.4
/dev/sda3 is / under 2.6 
2.6 doesn't mount /dev/sda2.
title Red Hat Linux (2.4.20-31.9smp)
        root (hd1,0)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.20-31.9smp ro root=/dev/sda2 hdd=ide-scsi
        initrd /initrd-2.4.20-31.9smp.img
title Test (2.6.7)
        root (hd1,2)
        kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.7-1.437.build ro root=0803 hdd=ide-scsi
        initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.7-1.437.build.img
They both use different fstabs.
The problem is not that I trash my root filesystem under 2.4, my problem is I
cannot unmount /mnt/target after I have been in SE Linux and ran fixfiles. My
method of recovery is to remove files from /mnt/target until I get corruption
detected at boot which finally lets me run mke2fs to get it back.
What I really wished is that I can unmount the filesystem, run mke2fs, remount it
and start doing whatever. My root filesystem is fine. /mnt/target is fine as long
as I don't run fixfiles.
BUT...this does point out the corruption that I have come to depend on...which is
wrong.
