Hello,
I'm still having problems with nmi watchdog on my S2466 board.  I tried lots
of different configurations with a large number of 2.6 kernels (vanilla,
-mm, -ac) all with the same result: no working nmi watchdog, neither with
local- nor with io-apic. I still wonder if anybody out there has ever
succeeded with a working nmi watchdog on Tyan Tiger MPX.
The symptoms are:
nmi_watchdog=1:
===============
dmesg:
	testing NMI watchdog ... CPU#0: NMI appears to be stuck!
/proc/interrupts:
	no NMI count
nmi_watchdog=2:
===============
dmesg:
	testing NMI watchdog ... OK.
/proc/interupts:
	NMI count increments
recovery from lockup:
	none
nmi_watchdog=2 clock=pit:
=========================
dmesg:
	testing NMI watchdog ... CPU#0: NMI appears to be stuck!
/proc/interrupts:
	NMI count increments, but rate is ~ 1/20s
recovery from lockup:
	none
The lockup-test is done with a little program that Ingo posted on this
list:
int
main(void) {
        iopl(3);
        while (1)
                asm("cli");
        return 0;
}
The only reaction I can see from this test: after some seconds (5+) the LEDs
on the keyboard start blinking when nmi_watchdog=2 and clock!=pit.
Always need to hit the reset button :-(
What else could I try?  Are there any BIOS-settings relevant to a
working nmi-watchdog? What information is needed to track down this
problem?
Maybe it's the board's failure, but as there *are* counted NMIs I still
hope there is a software solution to this problem.
Thanks,
-jo
