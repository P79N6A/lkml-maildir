*MOST*. Not all.
For example an SSE version will at least assume 16 byte alignment, etc
etc.
clear_page() is supposed to be for full real pages only... for example
it allows the architecture to optimize for alignment, cache aliasing etc
etc. (and if there are cpus that get a "clear an entire page"
instruction.... there has been hardware like that in the past, even on
x86, just it's no longer sold afaik)
