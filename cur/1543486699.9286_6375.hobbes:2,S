Q: I'm a new user which installed sysklogd and I see lots of messages from
   someone called MARK.
A: RTFM if you are new.  Ask when you are done, we will gladly help.
Q: I'm not new, and I'm confused with those MARKs everywhere.  Someone
   please make them go away.
B: RTFM, please.
Q: But I'm an experienced sysklogd user, I don't want to waste my time
   rereading the manual for minuscule changes!
A: diff -5u sysklogd-1.3-{29,30}/sysklogd.8|less
