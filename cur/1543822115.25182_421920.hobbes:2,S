umum...
as i am new in submitting patch...
althought i have already read for a lot of reference...
i know only a little about the format required :(
i would like to do whatever i need to do
may u give me some hints about how to do so ??
net-nice -n 19 rsync ??
sorry that i don't know what is it... :(
for how to use it
1. patch the source tree
2. chose TCP-LP as modules and make it
3. after install use:
  sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=lp
4. you will then find your connection is relatively lower priority
than other computers
i put my work in my site:

Edison
