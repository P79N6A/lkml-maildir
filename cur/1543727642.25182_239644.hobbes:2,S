Subject: elevator abstraction, anticipatory I/O backported to 2.4?

Are there any existing patches for a backport of the
2.6 elevator abstraction (or a specific patch for
anticipatory I/O) to 2.4 kernels?
I've heard rumors that Digeo backported a 2.6 I/O
scheduler. However, when I tried to download their
open source modifications from
http://www.digeo.com/prodserv/opensource.jsp,
 I wasn't
able to extract their work. (The zip file unzips to a
tar.bz2, which seems to be corrupt.) Who knows, maybe
an I/O scheduler backport isn't in that archive
anyway.
Please CC me on any response.
Thanks,
Josh
