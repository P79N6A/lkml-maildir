You may have to wait a while.  The biggest difference between Ingo's patch
and rtai is that Ingo's patch doesn't require changing the programs to run
as realtime tasks.  It makes the Linux kernel an actual RTOS (as suppose
to running a micro kernel underneath) so if you can program on Linux,
there's no learning curve for Ingo's work.

I'm not really sure what you have against patches?  If you have to wait
for this to be in the mainline, you are going to be disappointed.
