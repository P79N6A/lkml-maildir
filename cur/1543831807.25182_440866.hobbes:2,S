On the pSeries, its harmless to try to do i/o; the i/o will e blocked.

I wanted to perform all of the "down" type functions BEFORE the reset. 
The idea is to get the device driver and the various parts of the 
Linux kernel into a state that would be consisten with a reset.
I don't want to do these functions after the reset, since, at this
point, the card is a "clean slate"; it has the PCI bars set, but 
nothing else.  Doing random i/o to it at this point could confuse
the card; instead, one wants to bring the card up using the usual
bringup sequence.
For example, I tipped over one rather confusing bug: new code 
in the -mm tree blocks a pci_enable_device() if it thinks the
card is already enabled (even if its not). Doing I/O to a card
that is not enabled will cause either a target abort or a master 
abort.  Thus, I found I had to call pci_disable_device(); and it
seemed that the best time to do this would be before the reset, not
afterwords.  However, I did not play at length with other possibilities.
I recently lost access to my ixgb cards, and so can't do more testing
just right now.
