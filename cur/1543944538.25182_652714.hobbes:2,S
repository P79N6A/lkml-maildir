The kernel now derefernces per-cpu variables very early, essentially
in the very first printk() (via printk()'s call to cpu_clock()).
This bit me on sparc64 because of how I do the per-cpu address
formation.  If I booted on a non-zero cpuid things would explode.
You might be hitting something similar.
