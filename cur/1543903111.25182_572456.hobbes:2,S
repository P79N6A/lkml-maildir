Which CPUs ? 386 ? do they even have a cycle counter ?
Please have a look at my reply to this email for the x86_64 problematic
case. This problematic case also applies to i386 (non atomicity of tsc
read vs write to memory).

Yes, it could work. In this case you have to be aware that the 32 LSBs
of the TSC will overflow every ~ 1s and, in order to be sure to be able
to detect the overflow, you have to do at least 1 TSC read per second
(more precisely per 32 LSB overflow period).
