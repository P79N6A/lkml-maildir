It leaves me bemused. You speak of a module to install a raw userspace
IO capability. If that module exists the module interface exists. Would
it have to be the module compiled into the kernel that gets run on that
interface? It looks as wide open as ever, to me.

Of course, this seems to be one of those compromises between high
availability and high security. It should be made clear that this is
the compromise involved when the raw io filter is compiled in or not.
I'm not sure you can build an unfiltered raw IO capability into the
kernel SCSI, IDE, or anything else and maintain system security.
