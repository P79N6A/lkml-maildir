I have seen with some ide chipsets and/or ide cdroms that ide-scsi doesn't
work.  The machine that did this is no longer in service for me, but it
would lock the machine solid with 2.2.10  (it was a delta ide cdrom and via
ide chipset)  Sorry I can't give more info, the machine is gone.
I can say for sure that teac ide cdroms and piix4 chipsets work excelent!
