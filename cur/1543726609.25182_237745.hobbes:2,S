this won't compile for non-ia64, so you need a depency here.

please include your private header after system headers.  But I don't
thing you need snsc.h at all, just move it's contents into snsc.c

please use the existing pr_debug, or even dev_dbg where you have a struct
device.

the driver would become more readable by having struct file_operations
after the actual function bodies, thus eliminating the need for additional
prototypes.

You're always calling this with a timeout set.  Also I think the code
would be much more readable by opencoding this in the two callers.  That'd
also give you a chance to switch to prepare_wait & co.

Can't ever be NULL.

Don't you have sd->sd_rbs held here?

It would probably be more readable without these wrappers.
