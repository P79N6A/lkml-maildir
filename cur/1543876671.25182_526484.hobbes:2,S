Okay, I have no idea how it happend but you seem to have an invalid
config.  It looks to me like you need to select a platform.
One of the following:
	CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES
	CONFIG_PPC_MAPLE
	CONFIG_PPC_IBM_CELL_BLADE
	CONFIG_PPC_PS3
	CONFIG_PPC_CHRP
	CONFIG_PPC_EFIKA
	CONFIG_PPC_PMAC
When did this config last build a zImage?  I'm guessing either CHRP or
PMAC?
Yours Tony
