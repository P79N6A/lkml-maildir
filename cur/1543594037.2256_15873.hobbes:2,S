The current state seems to be 'BUSTED', at least for the cards
that I am trying (ZNYX 4-port, D-LINK 4-port).  (I'm using the 2.4
drivers, btw.)
However, I'm hoping that it will be fixed soon, because the D-LINK
4-port is very cheap compared to other 4-ports out there, and in fact
I haven't found a 4-port card that is NOT tulip based (please let
me know if you have 4-port suggestions!)
Other than one really old EEPRO card I have, the EEPRO cards seem to be
very stable, fast, and feature-complete.
