WTF? HFS does not allow holes. _ALL_ allocations there are process
synchronous. What's the problem? Pageout on HFS can not allocate blocks
and that's the only process-async method. If you want to sleep at
completely arbitrary moments while you are modifying the btree (i.e.
in the moments when it's in  the inconsistent state and hfs_get_block()
would fail) - too bad, you are going to have problems. And not from me -
power failure will take care of making your life _very_ painful.
