No. It WILL work. It will inherit needed capabilities from it's owner. But
yes, now I found that quite a few other things should be changed in "trusted
Linux" (for example now apache start with UID=0 so it has all capabilities and
then with change of UID it'll drop all capabilities; in trusted system even
with change of UID capabilities will retain: UID==0 is not special in "trusted
Linux"). So system-wide option looks unavoidable :-(( Perhaps it should be
compile-time option even: daemons like apache and bind should be changed
significally to work in "trusted Linux" so there are no point in allowing to
swicth between trusted/non trusted more "on the fly".

Agree. I think that even ability to switch between "trusted" and non-"trusted"
modes in run-time is overkill. Changes in system behaviour is too radical...
