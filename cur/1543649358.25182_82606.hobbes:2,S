epoll is not a poll()/select() enhancement (unless it is used in
conjuction with poll()/select()). It is a poll()/select()
replacement.
Meaning... purposefully creating an API that is designed the way one
would design a poll()/select() loop is purposefully limiting the benefits
of /dev/epoll.
It's like inventing a power drill to replace the common screw driver,
but rather than plugging the power drill in, manually turning the
drill as if it was a socket wrench for the drill bit.
I find it an excercise in self defeat... except that /dev/epoll used the
same way one would use poll()/select() happens to perform better even
when it is crippled.
