Sorry, it's the case. I'm looking at the sources in 2.2.5.
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
run_main() does cli()
 NCR5820_main() does cli(),
  then in several places
  {unsigned long flags;
   ...save_flags(flags);cli();...;restore_flags(flags);...}

I meant that since we enter NCR5380_main() we do not allow any interrupts
before we return. And (date; dd something-with-scsi; date) clearly shows
that even system clock does not advance as it should... (compared with an
external clock - "date" counted 4 seconds during a transfer that took 75
seconds in reality).
And it does not conform to the comments in the code :-)

After inserting sti() back at two places in NCR5380.c the performance is
still the same (as supposed) but at least the system clock goes as
necessary...
