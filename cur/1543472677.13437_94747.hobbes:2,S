I think that some clever and unique ideas should not be patentable (e.g.
arithmetic coding, compilation of the C programming language, the idea of a
purely functional programming language, the idea of a computer input device,
mathematical theorems etc. etc. etc.).  These things are great ideas, but by no
means are they devices or specific methods.  Not all ideas require patents.
