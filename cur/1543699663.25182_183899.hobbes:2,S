When did the autosync feature arrive?
It doesn't work for me(k2.6.11 with
MSI K7N2 Delta nforce2 mboard
and k2.6.11 with Shuttle Xpc SK41G
FX41 mboard with VIA fsb) if ps2
kvm switch(Belkin) is switched away.
When sync is lost on my pc's I have to
reboot. Symptoms are the same, on X or
text term--any mouse movement triggers
selects and buttons down but the correct
events do not occur.
With a kvm switch k-2.6.? loses psmouse
sync on the off pc. Rebooting is the only
solution. I got tired of this and moved the
mouse(logitech trackman fx) to one pc,
so the other only has to boot with the
mouse attached either to kvm or ps2
port on pc. That's fine until moving the
mouse back and forth for rebooting
causes the pc with X running to lose
sync. Then it can't regain sync.
