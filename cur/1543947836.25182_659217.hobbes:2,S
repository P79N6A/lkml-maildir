The only reason why de4x5 still exists is that the /tulip/ driver fails 
to work on a few chips like the 21142 (43?) shipped in various alpha boxen.
de4x5 needs to go away, it's been unmaintained for ages, doesn't support 
any of the new hotplug APIs.

It's not a work in progress, it works just fine for most people (the few 
that are left).
Last I heard, there was a problem with non-twisted-pair stuff, but 
that's about it.
'experimental' is generally a poorly maintained marker.
