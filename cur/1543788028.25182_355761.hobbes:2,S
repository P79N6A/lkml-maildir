The patch is basically code motion and duplication removal with just a
few tweaks thrown in to account for the change in location in the
kernel boot process when all of occurs.
So everything that was working should continue to work.

Sure.  That should be straight forward.  The only part that breaks is
the watchdog initialization/testing.  As I recall there was no obvious
place to put it.  The call has to happen after everything is running
so it is a bit tricky to find a good place to put it.
