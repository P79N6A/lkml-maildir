Subject: [PATCH] remove unused `locks' field from task_struct
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/10/7/30

SSIA.  This field is used nowhere; I had it commented out in my
"make allyesconfig" build and nothing complained.
Thanks,
Roland
