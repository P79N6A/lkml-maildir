Yes, that would be useful, thanks.
Eric, it sounds like one way to settle this would be to keep sys_sysctl()
if CONFIG_SYSCTL_SYSCALL=n, but only a stripped-down version which supports
KERN_VERSION.  And which spits a once-per-boot warning so people stop using
it one day.
Or we give up and go do something else.  This is all a bit of a pita.
