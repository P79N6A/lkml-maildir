More to the point, they will only call malloc() if they need more memory.
If they need it, and can't have it, then they are pretty much useless
anyway - cron won't be able to spawn any new processes (so might as well
exit), syslogd doesn't have the buffers to handle new entries (so might as
well exit) etc.
Basically, if you are OOM, the box is already hosed - anything we do after
that point should be considered last gasp triage, not a routine memory
handler strategy.
