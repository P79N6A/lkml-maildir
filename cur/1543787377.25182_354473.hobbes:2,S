I'm sure you have.  Hardware vendors are lost without
Jeff, James Bottomley and Christoph.
You see, it is because of your _enormous_ ego as shown
above, that the code is being blocked.

I'm sure -- flush interoperability down the drain.

Surely they are lost without you.

Ok, so the way I see it you want to show who has got
the bigger balls?
Jeff, I have *worked* on a Linux OBD-based filesystem.
Are you going to stop this self-gratifying stuff?

Reflection of above:
  The historical disconnect is where "the community" tend to 
presume They Know Best, when in reality it needs to be an equal 
tradeoff.  "The community" must admit they don't know hardware,
and hardware developers must admit that "the community" know their
own code better than anyone else.
Jeff, if you had started looking at the design and firmware
of any new SCSI storage chip, you'd see how incredibly similar
it is to the transport it defines, and thus to SAM, since the
transport itself has to comply with SAM for interoperability
(TMF and all).
Linux SCSI does _not_ need to do "its own thing".  There are
perfectly well defined specs, telling you how things are
conceptually _and_ in the physical world.
In order to control those objects, you need to represent
them internally (you can learn this either in neuroscience
class or in OOD & OOP comp sci classes) as you can see has
been done in the SAS Transport Layer code.
So if you want _better control_, higher quality you need
to invent _your own_ stuff as _little as possible_ and
represent things as they are.
