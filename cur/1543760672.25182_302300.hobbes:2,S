It won't help with PCI driver development. I tried implementing this
for UML. If your driver has any bugs it won't get the interrupts
acknowledged correctly and you'll end up rebooting.
Xen just posted patches for using kgdb between two instances but I
don't see how they get out of the interrupt acknowledge problem
either.
