This will result in the processor burning energy again after the first
interrupt, won't it?

If it does reset, you don't need that fuctions (you can use anything),
and if not, doing while(1) halt(); in both cases should DTRT even if the
system is FUBAR, and it should be even smaller.

Some CPU may do this, others will go via the random-generator mode into the
self-deformation-mode instead.
