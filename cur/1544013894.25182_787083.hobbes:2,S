It looks good. Although I wonder if gcc will still optimize this in more
complicated functions. Just to be 100% sure, I would recommend testing
it in larger functions like schedule() in the kernel tree. But so far it
looks like it does not hurt much to leave a small supplementary operation
in the unlikely() branch.
