Guess we must have the same 'puter :-)
I noticed Maestro support arrive days after I bought mine..  Linux is
amazing like that.
With kernel 2.3.17 I've found the driver produces sound quite reliably,
but it sounds wrong just cat'ing through /dev/audio.  No big deal unless
you care about Red Hat's sndconfig.
I also found the CD player output rather quiet, and I could not change
any mixer levels either in a CD player program or with a mixer program.
I guess they're still being developed :-)
