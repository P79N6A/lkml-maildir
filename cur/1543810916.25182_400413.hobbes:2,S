They are very reluctant to upgrade kernels today, for released versions
of the distro, and so they backport kernel fixes and security updates to
that older kernel, just like all of the packages in a distro.  That's
they way they work.
But they work together with mainline as they need it for their _next_
release that happens again in 6 months or so, with the updated kernel
and everything else.
