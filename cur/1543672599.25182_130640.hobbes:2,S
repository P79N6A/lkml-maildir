I have a 2460 wtih dual 1800 MPs. When I first got it, I had all kinds of
weird stability issues (random hangs, spontaneous reboots, etc) which
turned out to be a power supply that just wasn't beefy enough. Each of
the processors can eat up to 66 watts, so by the time you throw in drives,
AGP cards, etc, you're drawing a lot of power. I upgraded to a top quality
550 watt power supply and the stability issues cleared up.
As for hanging after rebooting, it appears to be related to ACPI in 2.4
not being complete, as 2.5 works as expected.
