Hello,
[ i'm not subscribed, so please cc me on any follow ups]
with kernel 2.4.21-pre6 my usb mouse stopped working (actually all usb stuff
stopped working). It's a logitech optical mouse which worked perfectly under
-pre5. I'm using the usb-uhci module.  I get no failures are anything of that
kind. dmesg just says:
hid-core.c: v1.8.1 Andreas Gal, Vojtech Pavlik <vojtech@suse.cz>
hid-core.c: USB HID support drivers
and
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
On my laptop (same mouse, same usb controllor) I also get these problems. It looks
to me if usb-uhci is not loaded or something, on -pre5 I get
this from my logs:
usb-uhci.c: $Revision: 1.275 $ time 10:38:36 Apr  1 2003
usb-uhci.c: High bandwidth mode enabled
PCI: Found IRQ 9 for device 00:07.2
PCI: Sharing IRQ 9 with 00:08.0
usb-uhci.c: USB UHCI at I/O 0xfca0, IRQ 9
usb-uhci.c: Detected 2 ports
on -pre6 there are no such lines. Do I have to something differently in
pre6? Btw, the usb-uhci drivers is compiled into the kernel.
grtz  Miek
