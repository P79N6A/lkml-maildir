Hi,
is there any effective and fast way how to find out whether page
given by its page frame number is currenly used by (mapped by) kernel?
At the time of checking I can rely that such page:
	- is not buddy allocator page and also not on per CPU lists
	- is not compound page
	- is not reserved page
Because I can check that from struct page's flags.
I was thinking about using rmap code to find all ptes, but I don't know
whether it is not too complicated way.
Thanks for all hints.
Please add me to Cc, because I am not the list member.
Best regards.
