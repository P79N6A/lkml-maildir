The non-default mount options are experimental, and the options to have 
things revert to old behaviour play it safe just in case.
I understand why all of you are doubtful about it going into 2.4, it is 
not that you are crazy, but my closeness to the code makes me think it 
is stable enough that it should go in.  Also remember that we have an 
extensive test suite, we have been benchmarking variations on this code 
for months, and I frankly don't think that 2.5 insertion will get it 
enough testing to be instructive to us.
