While for limited amounts of configuration information the kernel
command line may be suitable, it isn't when it comes to significant
amounts of configurable entities that need to be set before the full
kernel infrastructure is available. This patch adds functionality to
pass one or more configuration files through the initrd, but without
requiring knowledge of the actual structure (including compression) of
it; the file(s) is/are attached to the end of the already built
initrd (which obviously depends on external scripts not provided
here).
