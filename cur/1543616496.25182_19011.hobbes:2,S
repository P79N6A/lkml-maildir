I tried it before I answered the query. It works fine here. The
only problem I found is the VT that X was using ended up with
strange non-usable characteristics in graphics mode. The others
are fine and X can be killed, releasing its resources. Also,
CTL-Alt-Backspace works at least 50 percent of the time when
an attempt is made to lock it up as reported.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
