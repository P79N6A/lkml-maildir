0.0.20040329-1 Linux Hotplug Scripts
hotplug_20040329 from Debian unstable/testing.
Using 2.6.9-rc4-xx I had no problems with loading the firmware. As in my 
previous emails on the subject, I posted some debug that from the firmware 
module and kobject_hotplug, and from there I couldn't see why it was failing.
I know lots of changes have been made to hotplug in the kernel recently.
Shawn.
