Sorry to drop in some bad news, but it seems that some people have a
misunderstanding of the shared IRQ system.
Shared IRQs only work if all devices on the IRQ line agree to be sharable.
The way the IDE driver currently works in Linux is that it's IRQ is only
sharable if and only if it's "chipset" is on PCI.
Therefore, you would have to teach the IDE and the keyboard driver to
share interrupts.
