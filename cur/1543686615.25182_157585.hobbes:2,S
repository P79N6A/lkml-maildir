Here I have two 2 processor maschines which boot without problems up to
kernel 2.4.19. After this kernel version the boot hang after
initializing the scsi subsystem. No error messages or anything else.
The maschines simply hang.
The first maschine has the following configuration:
2 PIII 450mhz
AHA-2940U2/U2W
2 IBM harddisk
Teac SCSI CD-Rom
1 3com 3c905B 
The second maschine has the following configuration:
2 PIII 800mhz
AHA-29160
1 Segate harddisk
1 scsi hp cd-writer
1 ide cd-rom
1 rtl 8139 network card
I've tried to compile a kernel with and without APIC. Tried to compile
the scsi stuff as module and build in. I've read that there can be
problems with network cards, so I also tried to compile the network-card
driver as module and build in. Nothing helped.
With best regards,
Marcel.
