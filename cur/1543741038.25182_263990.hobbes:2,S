Andrew, I'm sending this to you since I can't find any maintainer for 
binfmt_elf, and mails to the list about this seem to hit some black hole.
Care to take a look and consider for inclusion (it's really small and 
simple)?
If there's something obviously stupid about this patch, then please let me 
know - I don't know if I should interpret the silence on the list as 
"noone can be bothered to look at it" or "insanely stupid, ignored". 
I'd like to get the warnings in binfmt_elf cleaned up, and I'm now trying 
to do it piece by piece (more pieces will follow when I get some sort of 
response to what I've already posted) instead of just one big chunk.

Subject: [PATCH] small binfmt_elf warning fix (copy_from_user return value
    checking)
Since my patch to try and clean up all the warnings generated by 
fs/binfmt_elf.c all at once seems to be ignored I'll try a different 
approach; smaller patches fixing just a little bit at a time. Here's one 
such tiny fix.
This is the warning that triggered this patch :
fs/binfmt_elf.c:1226: warning: ignoring return value of `copy_from_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
The patch silences the warning by actually using the return value, but in 
this case there's no great harm done if the copy fails, psinfo has already 
been zeroed, so a failed copy will just result in a few psinfo->pr_psargs 
being zero (which as I read it is suboptimal but not fatal).
Even though we could safely ignore the return value we can gain a tiny 
bennefit from it by using it to decrease the 'len' variable that is used 
in the for() loop below - if copy to user failed to copy all data, then 
there's no need for the loop to iterate over any more than what was 
actually copied (and we know the rest is zeroed).
So, we get two small bennefits from this patch:
- Silence the warning by actually using the return value of copy_from_user
- If copy_from_user fails save a few loop iterations (at least then some 
good came from a bad situation).
