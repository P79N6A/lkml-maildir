Hi All,
I updated the watchdog patches for v2.5.45. (To reflect the Kconfig configuration files).
Patch 1 : move of existing watchdog drivers in drivers/char/watchdog/
Patch 2 : remove of 'old' watchdog drivers in drivers/char/
Patch 3 : cleanup additional spaces in headers + addition of MODULE-info
Patch 4 : C99 designated initializers for watchdog drivers
Patch 5 : add extra watchdog drivers
Patch 6 : changes the CONFIG dependencies in wdt_pci.c (They were incorrect).
The patches are ftp-able at:
ftp://medelec.uia.ac.be/pub/linux/kernel-patches/
 .
The diff files are wd-2.5.45-patch*
Greetings,
Wim.
