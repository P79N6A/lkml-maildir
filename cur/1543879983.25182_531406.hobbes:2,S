Ahh. Would truly love to but the moment you said 'crash the system' I
had to bail. These boxes are in production and as such a crash would be,
shall we say, unwelcome. I might be able to fenagle something but I
very-much doubt it.
Perhaps Jean-Daniel, who is also experiencing this problem and seemingly
more frequently then I, has a box that he could run your patch on. I
think we both run pretty-much the same hardware (Dell [12]950s). I've
CCed him.
