Depends which x86. 
The single trivial arch function I proposed in the previous mail is
enough to untangle this problem and has two virtues
1. For most platforms the implementation is "return 1"
2. The minimal implementation is merely less efficient so you don't
have to hack every conceivable case at once.

There are essentially no other devices we care about. IDE legacy is
dealt with BIOS level and never touched again - so why bother designing
for them.
