I'm banging away on the bzip patch, adding a choice menu to kconfig for 
bzip/gzip/uncompressed, and I notice that the help text isn't working right.
To see this bug in action, go to "processor type and features", and descend 
into the "subarchitecture menu" at the top of it.  Pull up the help text on 
anything, it'll say there's no help available.
Now look at arch/i386/Kconfig, and note that there IS help text for all those 
menu choices.  It's just not displaying it...
