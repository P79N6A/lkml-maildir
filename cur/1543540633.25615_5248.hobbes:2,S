	Should not be necessary.  If the US government banned sales of
US books overseas, it would be unable to retroactively (as in not
constitutional) apply such a law that would require all sellers of
books that sold overseas to re-acquire said books.  
	If a US resident added code under the current law, then it
becomes an asset of the project.  If the US re-enacted controls, I
sure that they would be unable to require anyone who let something out
of the country to recall every bit of code.  Can you imagine Microsoft
trying to recall millions of copies of IE5 because it has strong
crypto and the government decided to re-control such?  I think the key
to protecting yourself is that your code-base is outside of US
territory and US control.  Regardless, do what you feel necessary
to make yourself feel safe.
