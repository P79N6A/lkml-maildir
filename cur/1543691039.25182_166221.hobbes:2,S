If I get this post correctly 
(
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0306.0/0764.html
), the 
bug is at least close to this. I understand that Alan's mail refers to 
which particular combinations of chip revisions and disk drives are 
affected, so that is why the workaround is applied to all the cases.
