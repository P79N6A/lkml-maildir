Mainly cleanup, but also point #5.  The i810fb, for instance, depends on agpgart, but
agpgart gets initialized way after fbdev.  The workaround is for i810fb to explicitly
call intel_agp_init().  Besides the ugliness, forcibly initializing the agpgart subsystem
out of sequence may cause problems.
With this change, in theory, I can move i810fb's link order so it gets initialized after
agpgart.

Yes, with hardware that I have.  I did try to at least compile test what I can.
