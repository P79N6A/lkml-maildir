The VM really doesn't want to strangle itself because it might be
talking to a braindead SCSI drive.
I have a Fujitsu disk which allows newly submitted writes to
bypass already-submitted reads.  A read went in, and did not
come back for three seconds.  Ninety megabytes of writes went
into the disk during those three seconds.
From a whole-system performance viewpoint that is completely
broken behaviour.  It's unmanageable from the VM point of view.
At least, I don't want to have to manage it at that level.
We may be able to work around it by adding kludges to the IO
scheduler but it's easier to just set the tag depth to zero and
mutter rude words about clueless firmware developers.

Could be that the Fujitsu is especially broken.  I observed the three
second read latency with 253 tags (OK, that's 128 megabytes worth).
But with the driver limited to four tags, latency was two seconds.
Hence my speculation.

Is it possible to add a tag to a read which says "may not be bypassed
by writes"?  That would be OK, as long as the driver is only set up
to use a tag depth of four or so.
To use larger tag depths, we'd need to be able to tag newly incoming
reads with a "do this before servicing already-submitted writes"
attribute.  Is anything like that available?
