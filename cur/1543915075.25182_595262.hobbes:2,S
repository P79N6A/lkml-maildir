Subject: git-send-email creates duplicate Message-Id's
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/17/264

The following might be a bug in git-send-email (git maintainers Cc'ed
and KVM list removed from Cc): 
Patch 54 got the same Message-Id as patch 61 and patch 89 got the same 
Message-Id as patch 104.
That's not legal, and users who automatically filter duplicate emails 
based on the Message-Id will not see two of the patches.
The emails are:

       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
