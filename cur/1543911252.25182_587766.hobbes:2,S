Mike, check the latest unionfs 2.1.2 code in
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/.
  In the past couple of months I've already
gotten rid of direct calls to prepare/commit_write in favor of
vfs_read/write.  There were a number of reasons for that mostly having to do
with races, deadlocks/hangs, and memory-pressure conditions.  I also have a
number of additional mmap related fixes in fs/unionfs/mmap.c that you should
probably look at as they're applicable to stacking in general.
Lastly, to stack on nfs, at the very least you'll probably need my lower_nd
fixes from unionfs as well, or something like it.  As of 2.6.23-rc3, you
need to stack on the nameidata structure even for nfs2/nfs3.  My patches
take care of that for now (until such a day as the VFS will have a true,
stackable, small intent structure that can be passed to a lower f/s).
Cheers,
Erez.
