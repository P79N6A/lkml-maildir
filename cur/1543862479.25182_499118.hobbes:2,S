wakeup_kswapd and shrink_all_memory use swappiness to determine what to reclaim
(mapped pages or page cache).  This patch does not ensure that only
page cache is
reclaimed/limited. If the swappiness value is high, mapped pages will be hit.
One could get similar functionality by implementing resource management.
Resource  management splits tasks into groups and does management of
resources for the
groups rather than the whole system. Such a facility will come with a
resource controller for
memory (split into finer grain rss/page cache/mlock'ed memory, etc),
one for cpu, etc.
