You got it. Disabling CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC let me get rid of these
duplicate/additional probes. Thanks for the hint :)
A real help text attached to this configuration option would certainly
have helped here. And the label misses its leading capital.

Maybe the option should be relabelled from "generic/default IDE chipset
support" to "Non-PCI IDE chipset support" or "Legacy IDE ports support"?
I think it should express the fact that people with modern systems do
not need it, providing this is actually the case - not sure I exactly
understand what it is.
Thanks again,
