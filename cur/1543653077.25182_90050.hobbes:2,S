Thanks Alan. 2.5.47-ac5 works fine for my PC-9800 box
 with additional patch. I put additional patch next URL.
http://downloads.sourceforge.jp/linux98/1561/linux98-2.5.47-ac5.patch.tar.bz2
But I met some not PC-9800 specific problems.
 - Doesn't boot when compile for i386 or i486.
 - Oops when remove a Card from CardBus socket.
Regards,
Osamu
