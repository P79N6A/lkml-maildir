I do not find it to be profitable to discourage the people working on
this project. If they fail, nobody loses. If they succeed, they can
re-invent the math behind threading, and Linux ends up on the forefront
of operating systems offering the technology.
As for 'crazy synchronization', solutions such as the FUTEX have no
real negative aspects. It wasn't long ago that the FUTEX did not
exist. Why couldn't innovation make 'crazy synchronization by
non-web-server like applications' more efficient using kernel threads?
Concurrency experts would welcome the change. Concurrent 'experts'
would not welcome the change, as it would force them to have to
re-learn everything they know, effectively obsoleting their 'expert'
status. (note the difference between the unquoted, and the quoted...)
Cheers, and good luck...
