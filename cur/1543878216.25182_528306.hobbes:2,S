Are you _sure_ you have a 1-to-1 relationship here?  No multiple devices
pointing to the same acpi node?  Or the other way around?  If so, you
are going to have to change the name to be something more unique.
Or how about "firmware" instead of "acpi" to be able to have the
userspace tools work on any type of firmware that provides this, like
openfirmware?
