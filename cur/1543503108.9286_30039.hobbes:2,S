Thats a BSD unix "we dont have an API" problem

Wietse is all too right about this. There is no networking standard. BSD
tries to declare itself "the standard" but isnt standardised between versions
itself.

Nothing to do with TCP. Very old Linuxes considered an error as an "exception"
this is not what BSD or current Linux does. POSIX 1003.1g draft 6.5 says
"exception" is specifically for urgent data from memory (I only read the
select not poll parts of such stuff ;))
Note that none of this is a tcp protocol issue but an API one
