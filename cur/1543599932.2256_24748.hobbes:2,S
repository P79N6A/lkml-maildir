Under the URL there are patches in 2.4.9 for ac1 to ac5. I am currently at 
2.4.9. In order to get to ac4, do I have to apply ac1 to 4 (in that order) or 
can I just apply ac4 (to get to ac4) or just ac5 (to get to ac5 with ac4 
automatically included). That is, are these independent patches (for 
different parts of the kernel) or, are they all for "ide" with each 
containing all preceeding ones.
