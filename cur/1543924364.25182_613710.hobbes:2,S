Subject: [PATCH,RFC 2/3] Fix scripts/setlocalversion to avoid erroneous -dirty tag
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/2/336

If git's index file is out of date, and some files have been touched
such that their timestamp doesn't what is in the index, "git
diff-index HEAD" may show that a particular file is dirty, when in
fact it really isn't.  Running "git status" will update the index to
avoid these false positives.
