You open any SCSI device, you do SG_IO on it. What is non-orthogonal in that?
Yes, I agree with you that it's hard to do device discovery, but discovering
devices is completely orthogonal to doing I/O in them and it's also not
a problem specific to SCSI devices at all. Hence we want to find a general
solution suitable for *all* devices and that's what sysfs, udev and HAL are
for. They might have some rough edges yet, but they definitely solve the
right problem.
				Have a nice fortnight
