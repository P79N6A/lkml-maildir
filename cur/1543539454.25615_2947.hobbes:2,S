..allows root programs to physically...
Regular users have no such access.

The point is that it is impossible for the kernel to ensure
that root cannot fry the hardware. All it can do is make it very
difficult. root is always allowed to access the hardware directly.

Other stuff is "broken" in the same way. I believe it's an artifact
of the firmware architecture, but I could be wrong.
