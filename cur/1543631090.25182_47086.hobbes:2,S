No. Ingo's smptimers doesn't have this problem. However I am not
sure if this patch has timers completely serialized with respect
to old protocol code that ran from NET_BH earlier. See
deliver_to_old_ones() in net/core/dev.c. Unless I am missing something
big, disabling TIMER_BH there doesn't stop timers from firing
in run_local_timers().

Only 2.5ish thing I use is the per-cpu area APIs from Rusty for
the per-cpu tasklet in timer.c. You can replace it by
an array of NR_CPUS tasklets each cache line aligned.
