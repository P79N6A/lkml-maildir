cancel_delayed_work() will tell you whether it successfully cancelled the
timer.  If it didn't, you should run flush_workqueue() to wait on the final
handler.  The combination of the two is synchronous.
The missing link is cancellation of a delayed work which re-adds itself and
where the calling code has no way of telling the handler to not re-arm
itself.  There's a patch in -mm to add that function, but I don't like it.
That's cancel_rearming_delayed_work.patch.
