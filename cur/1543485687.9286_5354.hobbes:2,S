This is a very important patch, because fsync() is needed in some
transaction oriented databases (they have to call fsync() or fdatasync()
on the log frequently to commit operations). For some of them 4 blocks
could be not enough though, perhaps a more generic version of your
patch that handles more than 4 blocks could be found - like keeping
the dirty blocks per inode on a special list.
