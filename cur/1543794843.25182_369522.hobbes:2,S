Could you run "stat titi" and/or "ls -l titi" between the
    "cat > titi"
and the
    "cat >> titi"
so I can see what cifs thinks the owner of the file is and the mode.   I 
also need to know the current user so I can see whether it matches what 
cifs has as the owner of the file.    Note that readdir (ls of a 
directory or ls with a wildcard) and lookup (ls of a specific file, or 
stat) hit different code paths in the cifs vfs but both cause default 
mode bits to be put in the inode metadata.
If this does not point out the problem, then I will give you a modified 
version of cifs_permission to trace what is happening.
