I was told it was just reading the ACPI tables from userspace.  As I saw
it running on a machine without a modified kernel, I had no reason to
doubt this, but it might be doing something else for all I know.
What I do know is that it somehow does work without any kernel changes
needed, and is in use today by very large data centers without any
problems.

Yes, I was assuming that based on the above running code, if this is
somehow impossible to do from userspace, I don't know what the code is
doing.
