Does the preemption patch work on sparc64? I just downloaded the 2.4.16
kernel and appropriate patches, patched, then make menucondig'd. however
i didn't find a place to turn that on. then entire menuconfig is
re-organized under the sparc64 tree, maybe this has something to do with
it?
this is my first time compiling on sparc64.
