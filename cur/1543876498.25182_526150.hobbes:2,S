well you did make it overly complex, you should just have dropped the
lock around
        spin_unlock_irq(q->queue_lock);
        i = mcdx_transfer(...);
        spin_lock_irq(q->queue_lock);
and be done with it. But as I wrote earlier, it'll take lots more to
make this driver close to functional. For one, most of the return
statements in do_mcdx_request() really want to be goto again's.
Updated patch attached :-)
