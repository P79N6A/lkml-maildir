emerge stalls. The vmstat did work normally.

So meaning that these last three lines indicated that for ~30 seconds
the writeout was much slower than normal.

The second time the slowdown was much longer.

Yes, I was not able to recreate the complete stall from the first
mail, but even this slowdown does not look completly healthy.
I "hope" this is the same bug, as I seem to be able to trigger this
slowdown much easier.

Yes, I noticed that too.
The only time I have seen background_writeout was during bootup and shutdown.
As for the stalled watch cat /proc/meminfo:
That happend on the third slowdown/stall when emerge was already finished

I will, but it will have to wait until the evening.
