I think that doing this would destroy all filesystem consistency 
guarantees provided by ext3. In this case you might as well use ext2. In 
order for the journalling to work, the metadata updates must be written 
to the journal before any of them start modifying the actual disk 
metadata, otherwise there is no way to recover in the event of a crash.
