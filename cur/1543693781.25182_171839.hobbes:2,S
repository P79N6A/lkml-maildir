Because RAID 0+1 is a rather bad idea. You want RAID 1+0. Make up the
fault matrix and simulate what happens if drives fail.
We can do both though, as Kevin pointed out. So if you want to shot
yourself in the foot, in the best Unix tradition, we allow you to ;)
I'd suggest moving this to the linux-raid list though.
