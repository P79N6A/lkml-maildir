   Anybody know if fast etherchannel support is available for Linux?
   This is the Cisco protocol where two to four ethernet interfaces
   can be bound together as one logical high-speed interface.
   In particular, I am looking for said support for dual Intel eepro
   10/100 cards.
   Any projects in prograss at this point?
None known.  Sun provides something similar with their quad fast
ethernet cards (the cards we do support under Linux), but they call it
"trunking", I do not know if there is any similarity between the Cisco
mechanism and what Sun does.
It sounds like a scheme for which limited or no specifications are
available publicly.
