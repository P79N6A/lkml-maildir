Hi Evgeniy,
Sorry for not getting back to you right away, I was on the road with 
limited email access.  Incidentally, the reason my mails to you keep 
bouncing is, your MTA is picky about my mailer's IP reversing to a real 
hostname.  I will take care of that pretty soon, but for now my direct 
mail to you is going to bounce and you will only see the lkml copy.

it seems to me you need:
-               if (q) {
+               if (q && q->bio_limit != -1) {
This patch is short and simple, and will throttle more accurately than 
the current simplistic per-request allocation limit.  However, it fails 
to throttle device mapper devices.  This is because no request is 
allocated by the device mapper queue method, instead the mapping call 
goes straight through to the mapping function.  If the mapping function 
allocates memory (typically the case) then this resource usage evades 
throttling and deadlock becomes a risk.
There are three obvious fixes:
   1) Implement bio throttling in each virtual block device
   2) Implement bio throttling generically in device mapper
   3) Implement bio throttling for all block devices
Number 1 is the approach we currently use in ddsnap, but it is ugly and 
repetitious.  Number 2 is a possibility, but I favor number 3 because 
it is a system-wide solution to a system-wide problem, does not need to 
be repeated for every block device that lacks a queue, heads in the 
direction of code subtraction, and allows system-wide reserve 
accounting. 
Your patch is close to the truth, but it needs to throttle at the top 
(virtual) end of each block device stack instead of the bottom 
(physical) end.  It does head in the direction of eliminating your own 
deadlock risk indeed, however there are block devices it does not 
cover.
Regards,
Daniel
