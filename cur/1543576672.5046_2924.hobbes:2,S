I haven't seen the patches, but I suspect strongly that they clash with
the ext2 smart buffer sync code.
For example, the old generic_fdatasync() function already walks the list
of pages and could trivially be extended to handle dirty pages in addition
to just dirty blocks. But ext2 uses the faster and more clever "walk just
the dirty buffers of this inode" thing, which never even looks at any
pages.
This is high-level enough that the low-level filesystems should not even
see this functionality, and it doesn't look very hard to do. It's just all
these holidays in the way (and if you think you can skip christmas with a
4-year-old in the house, think AGAIN. This is a sacred time.).
