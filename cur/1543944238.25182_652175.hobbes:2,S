It was a request from hpa, and he clearly had something in mind.  He kindly 
offered to review the disk format for bootloaders and other lower level 
issues but I asked him to wait until I firm it up a bit.
From my point of view, 0 is a bad idea because it is very likely to conflict 
with other things.  There are lots of things in the FS that need deep 
thought,and the perfect system to fully use the first 64k of a 1TB filesystem 
isn't quite at the top of my list right now ;)
Regardless of offset, it is a good idea to mop up previous filesystems where 
possible, and a very good idea to align things on some sector boundary.  Even 
going 1MB in wouldn't be a horrible idea to align with erasure blocks on SSD.
