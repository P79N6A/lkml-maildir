Yes. Exactly my experience (with 2.2.18 / 19 / 20pre). It is simply
not possible to make a tulip based card work reliably against our
Cisco Catalyst switches in these days. Sadly, because under 2.0.x,
these were rock-solid.
So I started to use 3COM exclusively (which work perfectly with our
switches) and eepro100 if necessary (or built onboard).
