A consequent (if somewhat silly) name for queue_delayed_work would be
queue_delayed_dwork, since it requires a struct dwork_struct.
Are there many or frequent usages of "undelayed delayable work" like
above, where runtime decides if a delay is necessary? If not,
queue_dwork could be removed from the API and queue_(delayed_|d)work be
called with delay=0.
