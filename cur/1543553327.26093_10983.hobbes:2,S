I think that's the right path. How much would be hard for you to add gcc syntax
into your compiler too instead of feeding us kernel patches? Note that it would
be a big advantage also for userspace (not only kernel uses inline asm and
other gcc extensions). And probably it would be an improvement to your
compiler too (since I don't know of other compilers that are as smart as
gcc in the inline asm syntax :).
