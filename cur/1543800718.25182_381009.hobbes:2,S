Yes, it seems to work so far! I'm just reading some GB via NFS (while writing this
mail on the same host). I already performed some other test: without initializing the
network (and still without swiotlb=force) all my SATA controller seem to work properly.
I did a "dd bs=400M" on each in parallel. So I'm sure that each of my 4G was involved.
(also I'm not sure, if EACH of my 3 controllers really used something above 3G)
All this was still with an unpatched 2.6.15-rc7 and with IOMMU disabled.
So I could either try "iommu=allowed", as suggested by dmesg from
check_ioapic() or I may apply the suggested patch for pci-gart.c,
or both with and without network....
May be I report about soon, else tomorrow.
Dieter.
