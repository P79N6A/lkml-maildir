Sure. What I want is an interface that encourages good apps.

Right. And I don't care much which of them will be the final
implementation.
The main difference that remains is that with /dev, all the immediate
data and the events come from the same source - the device file.
For /sys, you need to open multiple files, and re-read them either based
on information from yet another file or select()ing on them all. But
this may not be a huge problem.

It's nicer not to have to worry about that, I agree.

I think we're hitting a fundamental problem with sysfs/hotplug/udev
here. It was created to get fixed, non-changing names of devices in
/dev, so that they'd be easy to enter into configuration files.
Yet applications today want automatic discovery of devices and don't
want to rely on udev getting the names right. 
We should make our minds up, and decide whether we want the 'devices are
in /dev and applications just need to open the filename' or the 'an
application will find the device itself' approach.
This reminds me very much of the Joerg Schilling discussion (flamewar)
of enumerating CD-burners. Most people on the kernel mailing list just
wanted to enter the name of the device node on the cdrecord command
line. Yet Joerg insisted that the application should do the discovery.
Here we're doing exactly the same: Where simply specifying a rule in
udev, and a fixed name to the battery applet would have worked fine,
people are trying to design ways how to do the discovery from the
applet.
I still believe the first approach is the only one that is sane and
portable.

HDAPS, as explained above, doesn't have huge latency impact. The reason
to have high update rates for input devices (mice nowadays run at 100 Hz
refresh usually, gaming mice up to 1 kHz), is to not introduce
additional delay to the user->computer->user closed control loop.
The less delay, the better stability of the control loop and the better
results in the game. The limiting factor is usually 3D rendering, but a
10 Hz joystick will still kill the experience by inducing a much larger
delay.

Sort of a 'reverse select'. Interesting idea.
