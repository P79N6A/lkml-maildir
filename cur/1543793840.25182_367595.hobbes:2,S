Try select chip by interface :) (Timekeeping & RTC as ex).
But Maxim site is better, it's not disputed.

It's pity, but all chips of m41xx family (approx. 20 members) have same
i2c slave address (0x68) and have not some hwd model specific id
registers. Hence I couldn't made any clue about chip specific
regs/pins/... at run-time (and couldn't use two or more chips in one i2c
subnet :)). And the situation worsens, as various chips have various
time regs offsets, as ex. REG_SEC of m41t00 have offset 0, but
in m41t85 _SAME_ REG_SEC have offset 1, etc (God, who in ST was so,
hm, ...., so made such decision?).
So I coldn't see any suitable run-time method of detection which
function driver could use for current "unknown" m41xx chip (from driver
probe point of view) whithout Kconfig/module parameter prompting.

IMHO - single driver for all m41xx will be nice thing, but I'm not
sure that it will not be monster- alike when it be released.
