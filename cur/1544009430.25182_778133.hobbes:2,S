I guess you're right, but I just guessed it was a bios related
problem, where Linux does the right but wrong thing while windows does
the wrong but right thing, so I thought it would have been a bigger
problem trying to solve it, than simply use an -h instead of an -r.
Anyway, if people actually think this might be useful, I may file a
bug at bugzilla, or I can simply continue this thread if anyone has
something to make me test or any other request to help tracking down
this problem.
Thanks,
