I just confirmed the good news on NetBSD.  Out of curiosity I did
this test:  I cg-updated and reinstalled cogito, which did *not*
fix the too-many-open-files error.  Then I cg-updated and rebuilt
git which *did* fix the error.  Clearly, something you committed
in the last two days has fixed this problem.  Dunno what you did,
but thanks :o)
