Some ARM platforms have no need for a ZONE_DMA. The code in mm allows you 
to not compile ZONE_DMA support into these kernels.

With a alloc_pages_range() one would be able to specify upper and lower 
boundaries. The device dma mask can be translated to a fitting boundary. 
Maybe we can then also get rid of the device mask and specify a boundary 
there. There is a lot of ugly code all around that circumvents the 
existing issues with dma masks. That would all go away.
