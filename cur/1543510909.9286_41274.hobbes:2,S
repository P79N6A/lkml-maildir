You seem to be saying you're going to make changes which work with
config, and you don't care if they break menuconfig/xconfig?  You're not
even going to test the changes?  That seems akin to someone saying they
want to make changes which optomize running on an Alpha.  Furthermore, 
they don't care if it breaks x86 because that is a stupid architecture.
