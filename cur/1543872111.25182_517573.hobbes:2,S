That's not quite accurate.  This is what Ingo was complaining about
earlier with VMI being an inhibitor to change.  Core kernel will change
and occassionally break VMI.  It's entirely reasonable, and in fact
normal, to make these changes, esp in the name of easing long term
maintenance.  There's some mutual responsibility to fix things up in
the fallout.  But, I really didn't think you disagreed with that, so
perhaps I've misunderstood the above.

Right, so let's move on ;-)
