Hi,
I like the PARAM() part, but still have some question. Hope you
can clarify.

Why separating them?

Same question here: Why you changed this? 
What is meant with "usable to anyone using it currently"? 
Does it mean the variables of it can still be read/written? 
Can the startcall or the initcall still be called after stopcall? 
(Important if we rely on zero initialization, which we do in many
modules).
Can IO to ports still be issued and "transactions" still be
finished after stopcall has been issued?
Thanks and Regards
