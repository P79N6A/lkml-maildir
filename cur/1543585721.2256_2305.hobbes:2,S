The GCC warning has nothing to do with the (good) practice of having a
single exit point.  It is the difference between this:
...
out:
}
and this:
...
out:
	return;
}
I think that the latter looks better, and the C standard says that
it's also the only one that's correct.
You are the one arguing about coding religion, by saying that
_neither_ of them is any good.
