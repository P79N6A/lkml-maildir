But error path will leak it. On success path we would have
a leaked packet in sk_write_queue, since we did't see it in
skb_queue_purge() while doing netlink_release().
Of course we can place the struts in code to handle the case
when we have a released socket with the attached callback, but
it is more correct (IMHO) not to allow to attach the callbacks
to dead sockets.
