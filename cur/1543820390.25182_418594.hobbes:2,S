The idea of detection kref_put() with unreferenced object was stolen
from BUG_ON()es in blocks/ll_rw_blk.c and fs/bio.c
ll_rw_blk.c:    BUG_ON(atomic_read(&ioc->refcount) == 0);
bio.c:          BIO_BUG_ON(!atomic_read(&bio->bi_cnt));
But the kref counter usually does not become zero. Because kref is
trying to reduce the number of atomic_dec_and_test()
So this patch also set kref counter to zero here:
