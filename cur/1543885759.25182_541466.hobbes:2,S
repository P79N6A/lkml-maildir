Subject: gmail, but lets see if this make it to the list, my last 2 msg's didn't.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/8/248

verizon, by refusing the lkml server, forced me into using a gmail account to 
receive this list.  But now gmail sent messages seem to be dropping off the 
edge someplace, so lets see if a message posted through vz makes it...
