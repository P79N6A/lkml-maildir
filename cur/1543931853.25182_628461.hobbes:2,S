Correct, absolutely no traffic. So if it works for you, then either
it's something that got fixed between -rc3 and -rc5, or something odd
when I did a make oldconfig, I suppose. (Or because I'm on an x86-64
kernel?) Regardless, -rc5 is currently building, and I'll try it in
the morning.

Excellent. Thank you for checking!
Rafael: I'll update the bugzilla as warranted after testing.
