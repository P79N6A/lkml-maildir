Currently, avr32 doesn't include kernel/Kconfig.instrumentation, but
defines KPROBES in arch/avr32/Kconfig.debug instead. I want to bring
avr32 in sync with everyone else, but that will obviously conflict with
this patchset.
Are these patches about to get merged or should I just send my stuff
upstream and ask you to rebase afterwards?
