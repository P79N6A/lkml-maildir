Yeah, this seems fine to me.  In order to eliminate this option, we'd  
need to merge 8360 PB support with the existing board support for  
83xx.  A laudable goal, but not what the 83xx maintainer has  
currently requested.

Yeah, this is one of the problems with the protocol.

Wait...no.  I don't understand Vitaly's objection.  If someone  
creates a board with an 8360 that doesn't use the UCC ethernet, they  
can create a separate board file.  This is the board-specific code,  
and it is perfectly acceptable for it to reset the PHY like this.   
What ethernet callback could be used?
