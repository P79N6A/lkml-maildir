The advantages to the circular bi-directional list are:
1.) You can insert AND remove entries at any point in the list with
simple code that does not have to a:) test to see if it is dealing with
an end point or b:) know ANY thing about the rest of the list.
2.) You have access to each end of the queue without searching (great
for RR stuff).
3.) It is easy to get the compiler to do as good a job at insert and
delete as you can do in assembly (see 2.4.0-testX code).
In fact Linux uses this list structure for almost all of its lists, not
just the run list.
The problems with the scheduler list management are not so much circular
bi-directional issues as the fact that the actual dispatch priorities
are so dynamic that you (the scheduler) can not predict at list
insertion time the best task dispatch order.  A real-time scheduler with
fixed priorities has a much easier go of it in this regard.  See, for
example, the real-time scheduler at <www.mvista.com>.
