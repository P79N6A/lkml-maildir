If there are some "common" optimisation flags or sets of flags then
maybe they could be turned on/off by invididual config options? There's
already CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE sorta tagged as experimental. But then,
enumerating the allowable flags may limit the user's choices whereas I
take it you'd like to expand them.

I'm hoping we don't need any stern warnings in the kernel configuration.
Although I expect configuring bogus gcc flags is going to break the
build far worse than selecting bad options otherwise. If the user
makes a mistake in CUSTOM_CFLAGS is the build going to fail with
a message "error in CUSTOM_CFLAGS" or is it going to spew out pages
of gcc error messages?  It is nice if error messages can point back
to the source of the error, so the user doesn't have to look through
the entire kernel configuration for what they did wrong.

"info gcc" will give all that information in far more detail than I
have time to read.

Well, it can't be both silly and a fine suggestion. Does it dumb down
the kernel configuration process too much?
I don't want a single person to say "I can't configure this kernel
because I don't know what to answer for the CUSTOM_CFLAGS question"
and I think the "If unsure, leave blank" at the bottom covers that
problem. But I assume you want to encourage experimentation; there
will be a person with a bit higher level of skill who might want
to start tweaking. Here's something they can start tweaking.
