Ok, thanks.  As it really is no change from the current status quo,
I'll go with this until something happens from the discussion below.

Hm, that's a bit unfortunate indeed.  I'm not very familiar with ARM,
but is there a "majority" image format that is used?  If so, we could
have the kernel build system generate that by default for uImages.
If not, perhaps it would be better to remove the uImage stuff
completely for ARM as you hinted at in that thread.  The other
architectures don't seem to suffer from as many differences and are
probably OK.
