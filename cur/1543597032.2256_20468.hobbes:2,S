No, space should be available right away, and the journal have fixed
size (32 MB pr default)
Most likely the problem is caused by a big file (or more files) beeing
deleted but some program still keeping it open. Then the space can not
be reused until that program closes the file.
You can get a list of deleted files that are still open with:
ls -l /proc/*/fd | grep deleted
