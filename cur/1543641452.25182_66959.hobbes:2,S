   Conditionally exporting symbols based upon CONFIG_* is a PITA.  Do we
   really need to do this and will you accept a patch making go away?
Nobody else should need to get at the TCP hash tables.
Are you trying to work on a proprietary binary-only implementation of
Linux IPv6 TCP :-)
Franks a lot,
