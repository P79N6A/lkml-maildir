A couple more random questions:
 1) How does this lock manager relate to the Red Hat lock manager,
    the dlm-* patches?
    Note as an aside that dlm-* has 23 patches for a total of 14
    thousand lines, or about 600 lines per patch.  This is rather
    different than burying a lock manager into a 45 thousand line
    new file system patch ;)
 2) Would a diffstat be a useful addition to this patch?
