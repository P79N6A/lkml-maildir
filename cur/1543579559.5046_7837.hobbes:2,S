Of course, we need to be careful of this kind of stuff.  (That's the
only reason we have partition tables in the first place!)
But, for "well behaved operating systems", can't we do it this way?
(For the dos partition table scheme, 0x83 could be our "file system
type", 0x82 our "swap type", or whatever)
