I am looking at both 2.5.4 and 2.4.18-pre9.
In my copy of sound_alloc_dmap(), I see a direct call to 
__get_free_pages to allocate the buffer and a call to virt_to_bus.  I 
just thought that this could be cleared up by using pci_alloc_consistent 
(since this function will call __get_free_pages anyway and eliminates 
the need to use virt_to_bus).
Anyway, I'm not sure I understand this.  I know using the virt_to_bus is 
wrong, but why would we use __get_free_pages() here?  (This is not a 
rhetorical question, I honestly want to learn).
