how much of a slowdown is it?
distros already throw >20% performance improvements on the floor to 
simplify their lives by reduceing the number of different binary kernels 
they have to support.
somehow I don't think a 5% or so (which is the locking overhead of running 
a SMP kernel on UP last I heard) would be the end of the world for them, 
especially if it made multimedia eye candy work smoother.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
