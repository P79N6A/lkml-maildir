run fsck.
then mount the root device.
Try to chroot into the root device (could fail)
Then verify the core packages with the package manager from your distro.
(rpm -Va or rpm --root /tmp/rootmount -Va)
Then check all libraries match the installed cpu - If you upgrade to an
i686 glibc with a K6 cpu you'd run into a similar error message.
Good luck,
