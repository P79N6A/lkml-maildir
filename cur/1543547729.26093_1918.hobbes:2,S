I was wondering if any one knows of a way around the following problem,
and I wanted to warn people considering 3ware controllers as a storage
solution.
I talked to 3ware already and they don't have a solution.
The latest 3ware firmware for their current products requires that
all drives in an array be absolutely identical.
Say you setup an 8 drive RAID 10 array and a year later a drive
blows out.  You *MUST* replace it with an absolutely identical
drive.  It must ID completely identifical!
Whoa! What if the drive isn't made anymore?
Seems like a nightmare scenario to me.
Worse yet.  I just ran into it.  
When I first got my 3ware controller it was perfectly happy to
mix and match drives.  However, due to a bug in the linux driver
which was later corrected by 3ware they suggest I upgrade
the firmware.  
The controller continued to boot and operate happily but when
it came time to change the array configuration the BIOS refused
to work with mix drives!
I figure there is probably a way to modify something so I could
have the OS lie to the 3ware controller and I could get my
mixed batch of drives back online.
Pointers would be appreciated.
Maybe we can turn the 3ware product line back into a useful product.
