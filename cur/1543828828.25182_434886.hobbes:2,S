Because if it shared a file with something else, someone would complain 
about it bloating code which doesn't use it...  At the moment there are 
no in-tree users (though I'm sure there's something out there with an 
open-coded version of this), but we'll be needing it for Xen.
I'm happy to fold it into vsprintf.c though.
