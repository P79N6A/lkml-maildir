Your code is broken. See info gcc on Constraints:
`g'
     Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed,
     except for registers that are not general registers.
so you cannot use constraint g because it includes immediate and you cannot
obviously change immediate.
Also, even if you used "rm" instead, your code has no outputs, so it
illegally clobbers the i value without telling gcc about it.
I'd propose something like:
int i = 1 ;
__asm__  volatile ( "
	movl  %1, %%eax\n
	addl  $1, %%eax\n
	movl  %%eax,  %0\n"
	: "=rm"(i) :"g"(i) : "eax"
) ;
(that could turn into movl $1,%eax; addl $1,%eax; movl $eax,somereg)
or if you want to make sure i are kept in the same register/memory, then
int i = 1 ;
__asm__  volatile ( "
	movl  %0, %%eax\n
	addl  $1, %%eax\n
	movl  %%eax,  %0\n"
	: "=rm"(i) :"0"(i) : "eax"
) ;
Cheers,
