Power supply fuse...  Yeah, it happens.  Drives die, too.  This seems 
fairly uncommon.  And dear God, please tell me anyone smart enough to 
set up a UPS would also be smart enough to make tripping over the power 
cord rare or impossible.
My box has a cable that runs down behind a desk, between the desk and 
the wall.  Power strip is on the floor, where a UPS will be when I get 
around to buying one.  If someone kicks any cable, it would be where the 
UPS hits the wall -- but that's also behind the same desk.

Does gain you protection if you're not using the RAM cache, if you're 
that paranoid.  I don't know if it's cheaper than RAM, but more read 
cache is always better.  And losing power seems a lot less likely than 
crashing, especially on a Windows laptop, so it does make sense as a 
product.  And a laptop, having a battery, will give you a good bit of 
warning before it dies.  My Powerbook syncs and goes into Sleep mode 
when it runs low on power (~1%/5mins)

Suspend2 can take about 10-20 seconds.  It should be possible to work 
out the maximum amount of time it can take.
Anyway, according to a quick Google search, my CPU is more like 70W. 
Video card isn't required on a server, but you may be right on mine.  I 
haven't looked at UPSes lately, though.  I need about 3 seconds for a 
sync, maybe 10 for a suspend, so to be safe I can say for sure I'd be 
down in about 30 seconds.
So, another Google search, and while you can get a cheap UPS for 
anywhere from $10 to $100, the sweet spot seems to be a little over $200.
$229, and it's 865W, supposedly for 3.7 minutes.  Here's a review:
"This is a great product. It powers an AMD 64 3200+ with beefy (6800GT) 
graphics card, 21" CRT monitor, secondary 19" CRT, a linux server, a 15" 
CRT, Cisco 2800XL switch, Linksys WRTG54GS, cable modem, speakers, and 
many other things. The software says I will get 9 minutes runtime with 
all of that hooked up, realistically it's about 4 minutes."
This was the lowest time reported.  Most of the other reviews say at 
least 15 minutes, sometimes 30 minutes, with fairly high-end computers 
listed (and monitors, sometimes two computers/monitors), but nowhere 
near as much stuff as this guy has.
I checked most of these for Linux support, and UPSes in general seem 
well supported.  So yes, the box will shut off automatically.  On a 
network, it shouldn't be too hard to get one box to shut off all the rest.
It's a lot of money, even at the low end, but when you're already 
spending a pile of money on a new computer, keep power in mind.  And 
really, even 11 minutes would be fine, but 40 minutes of power is quite 
a lot compared to less than a minute of time taken to shut down normally 
-- not even suspend, but a normal shut down.  I'd be tempted to try to 
ride it out for the first 20 minutes, see if power comes back up...

This seems to be a whole different approach -- more along the lines of 
in the drive, which would be cool...
