Ooops... Didn't get through the whole thing. I think this concern has been
hashed over. Sorry!

	That would be the problem, and the devfs mount goes away when you
reboot,
I realize devfsd does something to handle (tarball-like I seem to recall?),
but
that seems less than elegant to me...
	Realize, I like devfs as it is personally, but I want to see it in
the
main kernel tree and this is why I'm trying to come up w/ ideas that will
(maybe)
help satisfy others and convince them to let it be put in...
