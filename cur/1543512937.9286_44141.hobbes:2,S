But sendfile() calls to nonblocking sockets are likely to be 
fairly short.   One could switch the socket to blocking mode before 
transferring a large file, but then you'd need one thread per
client, which is what we're trying to avoid by using sigwaitinfo()
to multiplex many clients onto one process!  So that lazy-TLB
feature is neat, but might not help too much in this case.

What kind of limits would there be on the number of outstanding
aio_sendfile()'s?
Would the dedicated kernel thread handle just one sendfile(),
or multiple ones?
