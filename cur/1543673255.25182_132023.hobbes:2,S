So you feel interrupt latency does not matter when
a machine is waking up? I'm not particularly worried
about that situation, so I won't argue that.
How about some sort of sanity check (as you mentioned
earlier), so this is not shooting off all of the time
during normal operation.

Maybe.
But most distributions have the USB driver loaded by
default, so if this new change stays as is, it will silently
cause erratic problems for such machines (with unused
USB controllers on the mainboard).
Then this investigation will be repeated over and over
by end users and anyone trying to support latency
sensitive devices (such as standard serial ports) on Linux.
So either a sanity check to prevent unnecessary
calls to this delay, or recoding the delay so it
does not run in the ISR and kill interrupt latency
would be the correct thing to do.
