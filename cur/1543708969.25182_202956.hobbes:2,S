Subject: 2.6.3-mm4 first run
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Just booted to .3-mm4 for the first time, already found 2 or 3 bugs:
- Two old bugs still there: in both radeonfb and vgafb, the lines above
  the first one printed after the fb takeover are white (vgafb) or 
mangled (radeonfb).
- New radeonfb bug: in the fb console, linefeed doesn't clear the new 
line., i.e the three lines
ABCDEFGHI
JKLMNO
PQR
would look like:
ABCDEFGHI
JKLMNO
PQRMNOGHI
- ipv6.ko doesn't work:
ipv6: Unknown symbol sysctl_optmem_max
ipv6: Unknown symbol sysctl_optmem_max
ipv6: Unknown symbol sysctl_optmem_max
ipv6: Unknown symbol sysctl_optmem_max
The symbol is listed in System.map however:
/boot/System.map-2.6.3-mm4:c0301ff0 D sysctl_optmem_max
Nothing serious, or as bad as .2-mm1 was.
Thanks to everyone involved in making it, hope this helps!
