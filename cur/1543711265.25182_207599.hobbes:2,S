Right, compared with network, I guess it is low bandwith.

This was just mentioned on the i4l-developer list too.
But not on capi_ctr basis, a semaphore per application (struct capi20_appl)
should be better.
The reason for the serialization is a possible re-ordering of messages
per application, so only the application needs the semaphore.
Thanks Andrew, I will prepare a new patch.
