Hmm, but doesn't it also unify transport semantics (i.e. chop
TCP streams into messages), maybe add reliability to transports
that don't have it, and provide addressing ? Okay, perhaps you
wouldn't call this a transport in the OSI sense, but it still
seems to have considerably more functionality than just
providing an API.

Hmm, people putting dozens of millions into building clusters
can't afford to have what is probably their most essential
infrastructure code reviewed and cleaned up ? Oh dear.

A good point :-)

But your switch could just do cut-through, no ? Or do they
need to recompute checksums ?

The second part could be interesting for TOE, too. Only that
the interface exported would just be the socket interface.
