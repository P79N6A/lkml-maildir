Actually these questions has already been answered (though I know you 
will probably grumble a bit :))
"early userspace" is the long term answer.  usr/* in the current kernel 
tree is a placeholder for an image that is shipped with the kernel, 
which provides things (kernel modules, userspace programs, firmware) 
that are necessary to boot.
The key is that it is shipped with the kernel source tree, and built 
into the kernel image, and _dropped from memory_ after init.  The entire 
process should all be automatic.
Linus ack'd the current stuff (by merging it, after some discussion) and 
would have merged klibc too, had it any users.
  ...
As to $current_thread, initramfs exists but "early userspace" does not. 
    There isn't AFAIK any infrastructure to automatically add firmware 
to initrd in any standard distribution (corrections welcome!).  So 
today, initrd+firmware is just a big pain.
Therefore, the easiest way to make things work today is to poke Intel to 
fix their firmware license so that we can distribute it with the kernel :)
