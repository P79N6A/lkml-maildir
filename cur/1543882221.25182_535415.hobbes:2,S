First, this is very unlikely event, and the behaviour is correct,
do you agree?
Even in this case, it is very unlikely that flush_cpu_workqueue()
will take cwq->lock before extremely short delayed_work_timer_fn.
Even if it does, work->func() likely will be completed when the
caller of flush_workqueue() will be woken by run_workquue() and
gets CPU.

Jarek, please, could you be more explicite ? del_timer() and
del_timer_sync() are different in many ways. What exactly will
impact the user of cancel_delaye_work ?
Oleg.
