for that matter we should have been oopsing w.r.t __initdata also,
right ?

Will do.

I checked all the architectures, only v850 doesn't seem to have
__init_begin (instead it has __init_start and it is the only arch that
defines __init_start). But, it does have __init_end.

We do not know how the __initdata initializations were _not_ oopsing
till 2.6.16, but fails consistently in 2.6.17-rc2. We spent some time
debugging the problem and got to this point.
If for random reason, the __init functions also start failing for
whatever reason then we have to go through this debug cycle again.
On the other hand, if we add a panic or BUG_ON in
notifier_chain_register, then the bug will be apparent.

I 'd agree with this in regards to exporting the function.
