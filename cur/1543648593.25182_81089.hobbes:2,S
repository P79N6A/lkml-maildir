nup, my understanding of that term is (in the cloak+dagger sense)
blacking out the sensitive bits with a big marker pen, typically before
showing them to people who shouldn't see the sensitive bits.
a quasi-sane way to do this bastardisation of the kernel sources would
be to do a make allyesconfig and remove anything that doesn't match up.
but given the amount of kernel source dedicated to generic drivers or
subsystems on any arch i think its a total waste of time, and i'm not
alone :-)
