Hello, while mousing around we ran a command
find / -type f -exec grep pass {} \;
on a Red Hat Advanced Server 2.1 using kernel  2.4.9-e.12smp based rpm from
Red Hat. Well the machine panic when grep hit /proc/kmsg.
I ran the same command on a machine with a later kernel  2.4.9-e.30smp
withour panicing the machine. Although it hung up in the /proc/kmsg.
Has this been a confirmed bug ?
