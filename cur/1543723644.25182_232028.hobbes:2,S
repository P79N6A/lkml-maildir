Ok. Let's assume
	int *buffer;
just for this example.
	((char *) buffer)++;
increments buffer by 1, while
	buffer += sizeof(char);
increments buffer by 4, because an int* is always
increased/decreased by multiples of sizeof(int).
So
	buffer += 2;
would increment the pointer by 8.
Similarly for other pointer types.
