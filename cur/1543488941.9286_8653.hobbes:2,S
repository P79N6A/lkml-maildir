Hi Marc.
Before I start, please note that I'm nowhere near being an expert on
this, so don't treat my comments as authorative - they're based on my
experience with Linux, and I could easily be missing something, or
just to have set up particular sets of cards for which my comments
were true, when they're not true for other sets...

In my experience, for any particular pair of PCI NE2K cards, the BIOS
will always allocate them the same way round, so if a particular card
appears first on one occasion relative to a particular second card,
then it will always appear first relative to that particular second
card.
As a result, you should be able to deal with it on that basis...

I don't believe what you're asking actually exists, but you could try
something like using the following bash script from your scripts:
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: `basename $0` mac" >&2
  exit 255
fi
# Check existing valid interfaces first...
FOUND="`/sbin/ifconfig | grep ^eth | grep \"HWaddr $1\"`"
if [ -z "$FOUND" ]; then
  EXISTS="`/sbin/ifconfig | grep ^eth | cut -d ' ' -f 1`"
  FOUND=NO
  declare -i N=0
  while [ $N -lt 256 ]; do
    if ! echo $EXISTS | grep eth$N > /dev/null ; then
      if /sbin/ifconfig eth$N | grep "HWaddr $1" > /dev/null ; then
        FOUND=eth$N
        break
      fi
    fi
    N=$N+1
  done
  if [ $FOUND = NO ]; then
    echo "`basename $0`: ERROR 1: No interface with hardware" \
         "address $1" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
fi
echo $FOUND | cut -d ' ' -f 1
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
Put the above script somewhere like /usr/local/bin with name hw2if and
mode 755, then you can do things like the following...
 Q> ifconfig `hw2if 01:23:45:67:89:AB` down
...which should shut the interface with that hardware address down,
whatever its ethX allocation is...

They don't have /dev nodes since such isn't appropriate, as I
understand it.

Hopefully, the above suggestion should help you?
Best wishes from Riley.
