There is an ABI version number (now at 12) in include/linux/kvm.h.  That
means any version of kvm userspace from kvm-22  upwards can be used. 
Since the ABI will not change anymore except in a backward compatible
manner, the old concerns of matching userspace to kernel are gone.
In terms of parity with the external kernel module, 2.6.23-rc1 will be
very similar to kvm-29.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
