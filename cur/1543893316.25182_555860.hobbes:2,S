 From what I've seen, it's the new Linux clocksource code.

They're unlikely to be better.  Instead, it would be best to see what 
the guest is doing.
I suggest downloading the source rpm for the kernel, building it, and 
sprinkling printk()s until we know exactly what source the guest is 
executing at the time of the hang.
Use of the qemu -kernel, -append, and -serial can redirect the console 
to the command line so that it's easy to capture all debug output.
