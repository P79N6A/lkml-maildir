That's being an idealist. You can protect against everybody
except the NSA and the disk manufacturer. Most likely they'd
need to spend lots of money in a clean room to get your data.
Forget the shred program. It's less useful than having the
filesystem simply zero the blocks, because it's slow and you
can't be sure to hit the OS-visible blocks. Aside from encryption,
the useful options are:
1. plain old rm  (protect from users)
2. filesystem clears the blocks  (protect from root/kernel)
3. physically destroy the disk  (protect from NSA & manufacturer)
