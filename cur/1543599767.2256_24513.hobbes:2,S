No, if the casts were ignored, it would complain:
/tmp/xxx.c:9: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
What gcc 2.96 is complaining about is not the comparison in the 
condition, but the the fact that the two possible
results of your conditional expression (x?a:b) are different. 
Change it to read:
	#define MIN(a, b) ((a) < (b) ? (int)(a) : (int)(b)) 
... and you'll see the warning you thought you saw before. 
	#define MIN(a, b) ((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b))
... and you'll see both.
