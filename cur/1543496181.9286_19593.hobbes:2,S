The proper method of achieving the original goal (mounting a CD and
treating it like a normal filesystem) is by using packet-writing. I
believe Schiling has asked for volunteers to help out here.
A packet writing filesystem would allow CD-R as well as CD-RW to be
used in the manner described by the original poster. It also avoids
the problem of wearing the CD-RW out by "wasting" the rewrites.
