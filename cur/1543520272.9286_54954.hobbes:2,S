Hi folks,
Finally the 2.3.35 pre-patches are showing sparc merges.  Glad to see that
DaveM & Co. found the time to catch up with Linus... ;-)
However it still does not compile, mainly because asm-sparc/pgalloc.h is
missing. Is this a case of "not yet finished" or did a patch drop out of
the queue to the "lord of the penguin".
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
