;-)  In general, every bit of the VM we modify and copy into the FS will:
A) break later on as the rest of the VM evolves
B) perform poorly on hardware we don't have (numa).
C) make odd, hard to trigger bugs due to strange interactions on large
machines and certain work loads.
D) require almost constant maintenance.
And that is how it works right now.  The journal is a subcache that does
not respond to memory pressure the same way on all the journaled
filesystems, and none of them are optimal.

Grin, we can't really compare interface complexity until both are written
and working.

Decentralization in this case seems much more risky.  The VM needs well
defined repeatable behaviour.

The idea is to find the basic interface required to do this for us.
Internally, the FS needs an interface to give hints to its own subcache, so
it must be possible to give hints to a VM.  I'm not pretending it will be
easy to generalize, but all the filesystems need a very similar set of
tools here, so it should be worth the effort.

Most write throttling is done by bdflush right now, because most dirty
things that need to hit disk have dirty buffers.  For pinned pages, delayed
allocation etc, we probably want a rate limiter unrelated to buffers at
all, and one that can trigger complex actions from the FS instead of just a
simple write-one-page.  
I'm not saying we should teach the VM how to do these complex operations,
but I do think it should be in charge of deciding when they happen as much
as possible.  In other words, the journal would only trigger a commit on
its own when the transaction was full.  The other cases (too old, low ram,
too many dirty pages) would be triggered by the VM.
For write clustering, we could add an int clusterpage(struct page *p)
address space op that allow the FS to find pages close to p, or the FS
could choose to cluster in its own writepage func.
