I did some testing and compiled some kernels and here are the results:
I was able to find out what causes the problems for me.  I did build two 
2.6.21.3 kernels, and one does work fine and the other doesn't.
This is a diff of the kernel configs I used:

The -oldconfig1 is the kernel that had no problems and the other shows the b44 
problem. So if High Resolution Timer Support is disabled everything works 
fine and if I enable it the problems do appear again.
I didn't test this on my 2.6.22-rc3 kernel yet, but I guess disabling High 
Resolution Timer Support will also solve the problem there.
The older kernels I tried also work perfectly fine and they didn't have the 
High Resolution Timer Support yet.
