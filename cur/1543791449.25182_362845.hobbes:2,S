No, thats not correct - XFS behaves as most filesystems do and
will write over the top of existing data.

XFS also rewrites files in-place.  You will never get someone else's
current data (that would be metadata corruption...), it would only
ever be uninitialised, previously-free space.  But as I said, other
filesystems have the same window in which this can happen (in the
absence of stronger data ordering/journalling semantics, of course).
