That was actually my point.  I guess I could have been a bit clearer...
Anyone who works with drivers knows that hardware manufacturers will
always do things like this.  There is absolutely no point in complaining
about it, either to the vendor or on LKML.  The only fix is to file a
good bug report so it can be fixed.
