Hi Robert,
not only this piece of hardware, but many others - for example almost all 
Bluetooth keyboards and mice are capable of working both in HID and HCI 
modes, etc. The layer introduced in 2.6.20 gives them the possibility of 
using full reporting facilities of the HID layer.

I don't think so. Firstly, it will take some time until the HID layer is 
converted to bus, as I have another things pending. Secondly, the 
iowarrior driver will still be needed to handle the HW-specific reports 
that won't be handled by the generic HID layer, it would only have to be 
changed to register through the HID bus.

No, I don't know Windows HID api at all. Is it worth looking at?

Just a sidenote - this is in fact what I am currently implementing also 
for the new hidraw userspace interface.
