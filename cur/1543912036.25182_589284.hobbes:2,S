Good question. Since it is useful to implement fast, interrupt
reentrant, counters of any kind without disabling interrupts, I think it
could be vastely used in the kernel. I also use it in my LTTng kernel
tracer implementation to provide very fast buffer management. It is used
in LTTng, but could be used for most kind of buffering management too;
meaning that we could manage buffers without disabling interrupts.
So I don't expect to come with an "upper bound" about where it can be
used...

Ok, fixing.. thanks!

"Local atomic operations only guarantee variable modification atomicity
wrt the CPU which owns the data. Therefore, care must taken to make sure
that only one CPU writes to the local_t data. This is done by using per
cpu data and making sure that we modify it from within a preemption safe
context." -> therefore, preemption must be disabled around local ops
usage. This is required to be pinned to one CPU anyway.

Does the paragraph above explain it enough or should I add some more
explanation ?

I'm perfectly ok with the idea, but suggest a small modification. See

The text snippet is good, but I am not sure it belongs between the
description of atomic_t type and its initializers. What if we do
something like: (with context, I tried to explain the distinction
between atomic_t and local_t some more)
                Semantics and Behavior of Atomic and
                         Bitmask Operations
                          David S. Miller
        This document is intended to serve as a guide to Linux port
maintainers on how to implement atomic counter, bitops, and spinlock
interfaces properly.
atomic_t should be used to provide a type with update primitives
executed atomically from any CPU.  If the counter is per CPU and only
updated by one CPU, local_t is probably more appropriate.  Please see
Documentation/local_ops.txt for the semantics of local_t.
        The atomic_t type should be defined as a signed integer.
Also, it should be made opaque such that any kind of cast to a normal
C integer type will fail.  Something like the following should
suffice:
