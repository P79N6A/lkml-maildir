It was an oversight not to do this when cpusets went in last year,
but we didn't notice, as the loadable module we cared about had a
hack in place from earlier development that avoided needing this.
In cleaning this up, we realized that the module needed to access
task->cpuset->cpus_allowed, and that the correct (and safe) way to
do this, via cpuset_cpus_allowed(), was not available to the module.
The other 4 exports I added on general principles, but don't have
any pressing need for.  The one I need is cpuset_cpus_allowed().
The loadable module in question we call 'dplace', and is used to
provide fancier cpuset-relative task placement by manipulating
task->cpus_allowed at exec.
