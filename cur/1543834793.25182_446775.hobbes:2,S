Networking and disk AIO have significantly different needs.
Therefore, I really don't see it as reasonable to expect
a merge of these two things.  It doesn't make any sense.
I do agree that this stuff needs to be cleaned up, all the get_block
etc. hacks have to be pulled out and abstracted properly.  That part
of the kevent changes are indeed still crap :)
