yeah. [ Note that what i opposed in the past was mostly the 'export all 
the zillion of sched.c knobs to /sys and let people mess with them' kind 
of patches which did exist and still exist. A _single_ knob, which 
represents basically the totality of parameters within sched_fair.c is 
less of a problem. I dont think i ever objected to this knob within 
staircase/SD. (If i did then i was dead wrong.) ]

very much so! Both Con and Mike has contributed regularly to upstream 
sched.c:
 $ git-log kernel/sched.c | grep 'by: Con Kolivas' 1 | wc -l
 19
 $ git-log kernel/sched.c | grep 'by: Mike' | wc -l
 6
and i'd very much like both counts to increase steadily in the future 
too :)

it will inevitably have some sort of effect - and if it's negative, i'll 
try to fix it.
I got rid of the explicit cache-hot tracking code and replaced it with a 
more natural pure 'pick the next-to-run task first, that is likely the 
most cache-cold one' logic. That just derives naturally from the rbtree 
approach.
