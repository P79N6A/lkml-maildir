Yes, I was wondering how you could say in the last mail it works (unless it
was on UP).
But anyway, I don't think it is a good idea to put this stuff into the
uaccess routines themselves. It is easy solution, yes, but will put a lot of
bloat into the kernel. It is common to do several copy_from_user or to_user
calls in a row (in that case it would for each one lock/unlock the
kernel_lock), or it is common to do them outside of kernel lock guarded code
(in which case it is really bloat - two additional conditionals, two memory
settings and several bytes especially for the spinlock/unlock code).
What I'd propose is moving as much uaccess stuff as possible before the
kernel lock guarded areas (many syscalls could be changed like that without
much pain IMHO - e.g. if we provide two additional namei/lnamei calls which
take the in-kernel argument only (ie. acquired by getname() already), then a
lot of syscalls which start like
lock_kernel();
namei();
could be changed to
x = getname();
lock_kernel();
namei_without_getname();
and so you would not have to go back and forth with acquiring/releasing
kernel master lock.
Cheers,
