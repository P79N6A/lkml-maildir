Reiserfs broken recently, git bisect narrows it down to commit
c1eaa26b671299b3ec01d40c6c71ee19a4f81517.
[   52.365262] ReiserFS: warning: vs-500: unknown uniqueness -30719
...
[27630.378732] ReiserFS: warning: vs-500: unknown uniqueness -30720
(and many more of the same with one of those two numbers on the end).
Manifests as various file creation operations failing, like:
(my /usr/src is on reiserfs with tail-packing enabled)
cd /usr/src && git clone --local file://`pwd`/linux linux.testcase
Git fails at creating the .config file in this example.
I had originally thought that my filesystem was corrupt, but fsck showed me to
be clean, and a different kernel caused the problem to go away.
I don't know enough of inode internals to understand why it broke like this.
(Anybody looking to confirm the string, it's from the uniqueness2type function
defined in "include/linux/reiserfs_fs.h").
