Subject: [PATCH] [efs] Remove incorrect unlock_kernel from failure path in efs_symlink_readpage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/24/201

If efs_symlink_readpage hits the -ENAMETOOLONG error path, it will call
unlock_kernel without ever having called lock_kernel(); fix this by creating
and jumping to a new label fail_notlocked rather than the fail label used
after calling lock_kernel().

This bug exists in the 2.4 kernel series as far back as 2.4.0, and this
patch should apply there as well.
