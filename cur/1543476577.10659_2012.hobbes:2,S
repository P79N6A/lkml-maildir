A non-optimizing compiler is likely to pass that extra pointer and would be
correct in doing so. However, the only reason to ever declare a method as a
non-static member of a class is when the method needs to access data for that
classes specific instance. Its no surprise that the compiler would pass the
extra compiler and, in fact, as a user of that class, you would assume that the
compiler would be doing just that from a quick glance of the interface. I
thought the issue was that you couldn't always tell when "this" was passed or
not. This is not true. Furthermore, I cannot think of an example that makes any
sense where your example would occur.
