Don,
I've searched the linux-kernel mail archives about this patch, and the most
recent 
thing I can find is that it was waiting for verification.
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0102.3/0553.html
Is there anything more recent?  Has it been accepted?
Also, if I apply this patch to the kernel I am running (2.4.2), will I need
to patch gdb to be able
to read core dumps made by threads?  Or should I ask the gdb maintainers
this question?
Please include my mail address in your response, as I do not subscribe to
linux-kernel.
Thanks,
-John
