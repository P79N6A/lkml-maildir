	There is no such limit in the poll function. You won't run into problems
with it until you hit about 16,000 fds. You will not, of course, be able to
_open_ more than 256 files unless you adjust your per-process resource
limits. And you may not be able to create more than about 10,000 unless you
adjust your system-wide inode and file limits.
