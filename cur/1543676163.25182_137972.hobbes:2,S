Hm, I send it few days ago (replay to Andrzej Krzysztofowicz post (sth with 
-rc3 in subject :)) with another fixes but without cmd640 fixes.
Alan made almoust the same changes but him ac tree still have got broken 
cmd640 modular driver (cmd640_vlb still is unresolved).
I tried hack it .. but I droped it ... maybe tomorrow i back to that code ... 
or someone goes to fix it (maybe Alan ?)
