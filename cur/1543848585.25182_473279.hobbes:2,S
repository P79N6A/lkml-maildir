No.  If pci_set_mwi() detects an unexpected error then the driver should
take some action: report it, recover from it, fail to load, etc.  If the
driver fails to do any of this then it's a buggy driver.
You, the driver author _do not know_ what pci_set_mwi() does at present, on
all platforms, nor do you know what it does in the future.  For you the
driver author to make assumptions about what's happening inside
pci_set_mwi() is a layering violation.  Maybe the bridge got hot-unplugged.
 Maybe the attempt to set MWI caused some synchronous PCI error.  For
example, take a look at the various implementations of pci_ops.read()
around the place - various of them can fail for various reasons.  
Now it could be that an appropriate solution is to make pci_set_mwi()
return only 0 or 1, and to generate a warning from within pci_set_mwi()
if some unexpected error happens.  In which case it is legitimate for
callers to not check for errors.
This is not a terribly important issue, and it is far from the worst case
of missed error-checking which we have in there.
