Changelog extract
	* POSIXification/newlib changes.  Werner Almesberger.
	* modprobe -C did not print probe/probeall.  Wolfgang Oertl.

	  Reported by Gabor Z. Papp.
	* char-major-10-184 microcode.  Tigran Aivazian.
	* Reinstate sys_oim.c in util/Makefile.in.
	* Add support for persistent module data.
	* Correct test for unexpected REL/RELA sections.  Maciej W. Rozycki.
	* Limit stack recursion in modprobe.  Kurt Garloff.
	* Support MODULE_GENERIC_STRING.  Jaroslav Kysela.
Support for persistent module data is the main change.  If persistdir
is set or defaulted in modules.conf _and_ insmod is run with option -e
then insmod will read persistent data from a file when the module is
loaded and rmmod will write persistent data to that file when the
module is unloaded.  man modules.conf, man insmod for details.
Notes:
(1) Persistent data is not on by default, you must run insmod with -e
    to support persistent data.  If you are loading modules via
    modprobe and you want persistent data for all modules then you need
      insmod_opt -e ""
    in /etc/modules.conf.
(2) Current kernels do not support persistent data nor generic strings.
    You must apply patch-2.4.0-test12-pre7 to get kernel support for
    these features.
(3) No modules currently have persistent data.  Module writers who
    want data to be persistent must make a one character change to
    their modules, read the above patch.  Even then, the user must
    activate the persistent data, see note (1).
