Hi,
I've attached the patch that lets the kernel SIS AGP driver recognise the 735
chipset as it seems fine.  I don't know of any system for testing the AGP
support so I tried QuakeIII and that ran fine.  The patch is against 2.4.8-ac4
but since all it changes is a couple of (infrequently) changed tables it should
work fine on later versions.  I've CC'd Jeff Hartmann with it as he seems to
be the maintainer of the AGP side (but isn't listed in the MAINTAINERS file).
Cheers,
Adrian.
