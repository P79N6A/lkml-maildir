I think when nice is changed, ioprio needs to be changed with it as a 
sane default action. I suspect that most of the time people will not use 
the separate ioprio call, but using 'nice' is a regular linuxy thing to 
do. Ideally we make ioprio part of the 'nice' utility and we specify 
both at the same time. Something like:
nice -n 5 -i 20 blah
