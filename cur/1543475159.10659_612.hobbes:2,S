Finally, this combination compiles out-of-the-box, even with the recent
outlawing in egcs of the invalid asm()s that used to be pervasive in the
kernel!
At least, it does for me. It looks like everything got cleaned up in the
kernel. Several people made an outstanding job at fixing all this.
Now I can indulge in my worst habit again: Compiling late-breaking linux
kernels with egcs snapshots ;-)
Thanks everybody!
