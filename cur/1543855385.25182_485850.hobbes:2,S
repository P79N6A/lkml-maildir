I suggest you start with
	make sim_defconfig
Your symptoms look like a misconigured or misbuilt vmlinux.  The sim_defconfig
If you're running on IA32, then you need something like:
	make CROSS_COMPILE=ia64-linux-gnu ARCH=ia64 boot 
to build kernel and bootloader.
You need to get or build yourself a disk image.  Instructions for
building at
