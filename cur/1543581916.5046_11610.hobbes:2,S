The change I was happy about was the one between 2.4.0ac10 and
2.4.1ac11. I think that it's a good thing that a few percent more memory
bandwidth appears from nowhere... Well, but that's just me I guess.

*Scratching my head* I have no idea of what your're talking about.
Sorry. Im using stream_whatever.cpp and whatever might be in it.

I just used the suggested optimizations.

Not quite sure, that the BIOS says "sdram cycle length=2" is all I know.

Oh-well, I guess I just have a even dirt-cheaper machine than you. I
haven't got any idea of how machines similar to mine perform.
