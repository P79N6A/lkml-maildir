I would like to add my vote to including George's high-res patches in 
2.5...  The advantages have been expounded by others, along with their few 
downsides (compared to just bumping up HZ).  Especially for embedded 
systems, but in general also, these make sense..  I'm nearly done with an 
initial mips implementation, which we'll be using in my group at Cisco.
Thanks,
Brad
