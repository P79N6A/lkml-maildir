There are several "return i"'s in the inner loop in get_user_pages.
Essentially, if something goes wrong in handle_mm_fault when pages have
already been allocated, it returns with the pages allocated so far. I
didn't look closer into exactly why handle_mm_fault fails, but I did
confirm the result (that get_user_pages returns less than the requested
amount of pages, and that map_user_kiobuf then crashes, under tmpfs mmap 
mappings). 
Probably, the tmpfs page limit makes handle_mm_fault return an error when
you try to kiobuf-map an mmap'ed area and tmpfs runs out of pages, so you
get a similar situation as when you get a real OOM.

The alternative patch is to fix the flush loop, and let map_user_kiobuf
actually return an incomplete mapping and hope that all drivers handle it
correctly (I doubt it).
I think the situation arises so seldomly that it is better to reject the
mapping than to try to squeeze out the few cases where the drivers can
actually make anything useful from an incomplete mapping ?
