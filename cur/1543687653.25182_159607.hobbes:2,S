And to me.  If VM_SHARED is set, then __vma_link_file puts the vma on
on i_mmap_shared.  If VM_SHARED is not set, it puts the vma on i_mmap.
flush_dcache_page treats i_mmap_shared and i_mmap lists equally.
Might the problem be in parisc's __flush_dcache_page,
which only examines i_mmap_shared?
Though it's odd, I'm not keen on changing do_mmap_pgoff's usage of
VM_SHARED in a hurry: it's worked like that for years, and other
things (I forget) depend on it.
