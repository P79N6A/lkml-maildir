Hi Dave,
The "hooks" have default funtions in the patch (see track.c), all of
which do exactly what Stratus needs them to do.  Knowing that this
functionality is only needed by Stratus, the hook was my attempt to
allow other users of this interface to make it behave differently.  I
wouldn't object to removing the hooks and instead calling the default
functions directly.
