The reality is that most of the critical temperature events
are false positives, and for those that are not, the hardware
will keep itself from burning even when the OS control fails.
If we confuse some self-supporting kernel types, that is too bad.
If they're supporting themselves, they should read the change logs
for the kernels that they download.  I don't think
this is of a magnitude that it needs to wait for 2.7 to be fixed.
