It used to work fine in the past; now as Felipe said, it's a PITA. Con's
patch helps but it's not even near than what it used to be. My make -j 25
without any skip is now -j3 with Con's patch and some mp3 skips. Perhaps
i should start testing when it stopped "working" (i always save the kernel
images)
