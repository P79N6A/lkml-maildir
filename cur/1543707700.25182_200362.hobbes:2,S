One way is that initialization specific to a given board or machine
is called from its INIT_MACHINE callback.  That can define platform
devices (SOC, ASICs, discrete parts, etc) and initialize platform_data
to feed drivers the right hardware info (addressing, which GPIOs etc).
Then normal platform_bus binding magic can apply, so that a driver
named "fred" gets probed for devices named "fred".
