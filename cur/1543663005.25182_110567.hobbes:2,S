Wow, looks pretty good to me.
I was too lazy to check, but you may want to be careful of:
list iteration direction.  IIRC there were some list traversals that 
happened in reverse order, and you don't want to accidentally change 
that in the cleanup.  I'm not saying you did... just that is something 
to check.
