I remember a while back there being a thread on the
inability to set UDMA100 on the AMD 7411 chipset.
I am wondering if this was ever solved, if it was what do
I need to do to enable it.  I tried setting IGNORE word93
Validation BITS but it still registered as being UDMA33.
If there is a patch for this can someone give me a link?
I have two drives that are capable of UDMA100 and the
cable is correct for UDMA100 and it's kinda a bummer to
only run em at UDMA33.
