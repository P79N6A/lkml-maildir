vmscan: ignore swap token when in trouble 
It solves one of the problems, but your fix is really the only complete
fix I have in hands since this thread(s) started. + my simple changes to
the whom to kill selection :)
Also your modification slow down the machine in case of low memory. This
makes sense and does not hurt anybody. But it's still better than the
crappy oom kills which I still have with rc3 even in "normal" desktop
usage.

We are discussing this since nearly two month. Is there a final fixup in
sight before christmas ? And I mean christmas 2004.
I'm just waiting for somebody who advises me to put more memory into my
boxes.
