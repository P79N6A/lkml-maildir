Ok.

I'll apply it to the 2.5.x tree - it's not as if it can hurt anything (it
will actually generate better code, as a signed divide is slightly more
complex than just a shift due to rounding issues, and gcc doesn't know
that the inode length will always be non-negative).
Whether it is worth working around in 2.4.x I don't have any real opinion
on, but I doubt it is worthwhile to compile 2.4.x with gcc-3.0.x anyway.
But again, applying it won't hurt.
