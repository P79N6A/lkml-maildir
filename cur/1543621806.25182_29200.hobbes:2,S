Then fix your driver. All the drivers I looked at do stuff like this...
which seems to do the job nicely
static int close_pad(struct inode * inode, struct file * file)
{
        lock_kernel();
        fasync_pad(-1, file, 0);
        if (!--active)
                outb(0x30, current_params.io+2);  /* switch off digitiser */
        unlock_kernel();
        return 0;
}
