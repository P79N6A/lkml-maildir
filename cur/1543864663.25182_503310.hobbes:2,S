When you have I/O errors during _writes_ (not Read!!)  the raid must
kick the disk out of the array before the OS ever notices. And if it's
software raid that you're using, the OS should kick out the disk
before your app ever notices any I/O error. when the write I/O error
happens, it's not a problem for the application to solve.
when the I/O error reaches the filesystem if you're lucky if the OS
won't crash (ext3 claims to handle it), if your app receives the I/O
error all you should be doing is to shutdown things gracefully sending
all errors you can to the admin.
It doesn't matter much where the error happend, all it matters is that
you didn't have a fault tolerant raid setup (your fault) and your
primary disk just died and you're now screwed(tm). If you could trust
that part of the disk is still sane you could perhaps attempt to avoid
a restore from the last backup, otherwise all you can do is the
equivalent of a e2fsck -f on the db metadata after copying what you
can still read to the new device.
The only time I got a I/O error on writes, about 1G of the disk was
gone, not very useful to know the first 512byte region that
failed... unreadable and unwriteable. Every other time, writing to the
disk actually solved the read I/O error (they weren't write I/O errors
of course).
Now if you're careful enough you can track down which data generated
the I/O error by queuing the blocks that you write in between every
fsync. So you can still know if perhaps only the journal has generated
write I/O errors, in such a case you could tell the user that he can
copy the data files and let the journal be regenerated on the new
disk. I doubt it will help much in practice though (in such a case, I
would always restore the last backup just in case).

Sorry but as far as ordering is concerned, O_DIRECT, fsync and O_SYNC
offers exactly the same guarantees. Feel free to check the real life
db code. Even bdb uses fsync.

See above.

Please try yourself, it's simple enough:
       time dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null bs=16M count=100
       time dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null bs=16M count=100 iflag=sync
       time dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null bs=16M count=100 iflag=direct
if you can measure any slowdown in the sync/direct you're welcome (it
runs faster here... as it should). The pipeline stall is not
measurable when it's so infrequent, and actually the pipeline stall is
not a big issue when the I/O is contigous and the dma commands are
always large.
aio is mandatory only while dealing with small buffers, especially
while seeking to take advantage of the elevator.

This whole thing is about performance, if you remove performance
factors from the equation, you can stick to your O_SYNC 512bytes at
time to the journal design. You're perfectly right that when you
remove performance from the equation you can claim that O_DIRECT is
much the same as O_SYNC.

Guess what, if O_SYNC could run as fast as O_DIRECT by still passing
through pagecache, O_DIRECT wouldn't exist. You can't pretend to
describe the semantics of any kernel API if you remove performance
considerations from it. It must be some not useful university theory
if they thought you that performance evaluation must not be present in
the semantics. If that's the case, it's best you stop talking about
semantics when you discuss about any kernel APIs. A ton of kernel APIs
are all about improving performance, so they'll all be the same if you
only look at your performance agnostic semantics, it's not just
O_DIRECT that would become the same as O_SYNC.
The thing I could imagine to avoid bypassing the pagecache, would be
to make MAP_SHARED asynchronous with a new readahead AIO method,
combined with a trick to fill pagetables scattered all over the
address space of the task with a single entry in the kernel (like
mlock does but with SG and w/o pte pinning), and then you would need
to find a way to map ext3/4 pagecache using largepages but without
triggering 2M or 1G reads at every largepte fill. If you think about
it, you'll probably realize O_DIRECT+hugetlbfs is much cleaner and
probably still faster ;). And still MAP_SHARED of ext4 wouldn't be the
same as MAP_SHARED of tmpfs, as it forbids to build logical indexes in
place (you'd need to cow before you can modify the cache).
