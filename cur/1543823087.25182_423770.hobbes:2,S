Thanks for reporting.
Either you have an active page on the inactive list, or your hardware has
flipped a bit in page->flags. I was going to say the latter is more likely,
however -- AFAIKS, the first oops should cause that page to be lost from the
LRU list, so the second oops shouldn't happen if the flip a single bad bit,
and should be pretty unlikely if it is a random error.
Still, anything explainable by a single bit flip is worth running memtest86+
overnight for.
