I'm not sure if this is automatically fixed or not yet.
With the new patch:
1) If ACPI fails to parse a table, it disables ACPI, and so disables any 
attempt to use ACPI for PRT routing.
2) If ACPI is enabled, and enters the function you patched, code further in 
checks if the routing tables have any entries. If not, it rejects the 
attempt.
From your patch, I get the impression (1) is what you were patching for.. am I 
right? In that case, there shouldn't be a problem.
