	Just another datapoint.  On my 300MHz PII laptop, ls and tab
completion often hang, taking up 100% CPU on -test11.  2.4.19-pre3-ac2,
my 2.4 kernel, doesn't even blip the CPU.
	That said, -test11 performs much better than 2.4.2[01], which
used to pause the system entirely for 30 seconds or more.
	If there are any knobs I can turn to tweak this, I'm interested.
