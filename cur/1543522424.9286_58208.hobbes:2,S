Summary: knfsd's nlm seems to mishandle nlm SHARE requests
Tangentially, I've been exporting directories via NFS to a Netware
server running Novell's NFS for Netware v2.4.  This product has
several snafus that I won't go into, but it also illuminated a (?)
bug in knfsd.  I've tried this in 2.3.39, and 2.2.13 with Trond's
patches and the SGI nlm4 patches, both on top of a vanilla Redhat 6.0
install.  Both have the same errors.
Exporting a directory from SGI's Irix 6.5.4m by NFS to a Netware box
and deleting a file in that directory from a netware session, the
following happens:
 novell -> irix       NFS C LOOKUP2 FH=C497 text-doc.txt
 irix -> novell       NFS R LOOKUP2 OK FH=C495
 novell -> irix       NLM C SHARE3 OH=0500 FH=C495 Mode=0 Access=2
 irix -> novell       NLM R SHARE3 OH=0500 granted 0
 novell -> irix       NLM C UNSHARE3 OH=0600 FH=C495 Mode=0 Access=2
 irix -> novell       NLM R UNSHARE3 OH=0600 granted 0
 novell -> irix       NFS C REMOVE2 FH=C497 text-doc.txt
 irix -> novell       NFS R REMOVE2 OK
Try it with a directory exported from Linux and the following
happens:
 novell -> linux       NFS C LOOKUP2 FH=234C text-doc.txt
 linux -> novell       NFS R LOOKUP2 OK FH=6516
 novell -> linux       NLM C SHARE3 OH=9809 FH=6516 Mode=0 Access=2
 linux -> novell       NLM R SHARE3 OH=9809 denied (no locks) 0
Poking about in the knfsd code, I see that when the NLM SHARE request
comes in, we ultimately end up calling nfsd_permission() to check
read access on the file to be shared.  However, this is checked with
a UID of nobody.  SHARE denies the lock.  Thus, unless all files on
the exported directory are world-readable, even a properly
authenticated owner on the Netware system can't do anything with them.
Having pointed out the problem, I don't know what to do about it as,
AIUI the NLM requests don't have associated UID information.  This is
why the permission check is done as nobody: the RPC request
containing the SHARE has no associated UID.  Fudging the permission
check allows all sorts of nasty access violations to occur.
Is this a real problem or am I just rather stupid?  Apologies if it's
real but known - I did hunt around in linux-kernel archives but
couldn't see anything relevant.
