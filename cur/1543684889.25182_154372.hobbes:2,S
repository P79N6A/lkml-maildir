Subject: Convert utime, stime, cutime, cstime to struct timeval

I've converted the task struct items mentioned in $subject to struct 
timeval and converted all the core code that I found that touched it to 
the appropriate conversions.  This is a prerequisite patch for forward 
porting the process timing patch I've written for 2.4 kernels.  The 
process timing patch uses the tsc on x86 machines to give much more 
accurate process timing instead of the current statistical process 
timing.  I've attempted to make sure that this won't break arches other 
than x86 (and I know it's sufficient for the ppc64, ppc, ia64, and 
x86_64 in addition to x86 under the 2.4 kernel, but I might have missed 
something under 2.6).
