Ok, I solved the compilation problems and with this kernel swsusp does 
not hang anymore.
The resume works however the network adapter (Broadcom 4400) does not 
even when restarting the network.
ifconfig eth0 shows very big counters:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:C0:9F:26:C7:15

Any ideas? Maybe the driver for this network card does not (correctly) 
implement suspend/resume ?
