I'm not recompling the user-space daemon.  The problem is that the kernel
autofs is using AUTOFS_PROTO_VERSION to check against min_protocol and
max_protocol (or whatever they're called), and AUTOFS_PROTO_VERSION is now
4.  The user-space daemon space daemon specifies version 3 as the maximum
protocol.  This is where the problem is.
You may want to take a clean tree from Linus, remake it from scratch, and
try it.  I'm confident that you will find the problem.
