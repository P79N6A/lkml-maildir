I use gcc-2.95 happily on ppc.  Better thing is to either fix it up not to
use anonymous unions (which is a pitty because that feature helps making
code more readable sometimes) or stick a
#if (__GNUC__ < 3)
# error "This driver requires GCC 3.x"
#endif
ontop of the driver so people know why it fails at least.
Still wondering why these fixes don't go trhough linux-scsi..
