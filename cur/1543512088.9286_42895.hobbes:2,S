While I'm not sure there is really anything about devfs that needs fixing,
if there is then surely it can and should be fixed before including it in
the kernel.
Also, it is too late for 2.3.x, which is now feature frozen.  If devfs
needs to be fixed, start fixing it now and then submit it against 2.5.0
next year.
