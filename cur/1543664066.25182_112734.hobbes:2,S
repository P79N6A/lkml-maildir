It might, under some loads.
However, I don't think it's a long-term solution, since the hashing will
mean that for any reasonably spread out load you _will_ always walk all
dentries.
So the long-term solution is to either use a local lookup (which we
ended up doing for the page cache) _or_ to limit the number of dentries
themselves some way.  The latter sounds like a bad idea.

I'd love to see somebody try.  The main worry is the overhead required
per directory dentry and keeping it scalable.  The dentry tree _will_ be
quickly populated and one common case is a few huge directories, yet at
the same time for most dentries there won't be any children at all or
very few of them). 
Right now the "child" list is just a simple linked list, and changing
that to something more complex might make it possible to get rid of the
hash entirely. But increasing the size of individual dentries is a bad
idea, so it would have to be something fairly smart.
