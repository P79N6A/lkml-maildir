I take here ohm as a reference (this come from my limited understanding of
this daemon so there might be inaccuracy) driver export through HAL
there power management tunning capacity, Then an ohm plugin would use
HAL to give a higher
view of this capacity and also manage policy, preference, permission, ...
Last consumer in power management food chain would be an user interface which
will communicate with ohm (and with all ohm plugin) so desktop writter (gnome,
kde, ...) can write some kind of power management center where each ohm plugin
can have its own panel. So in the end the user got one place to do all its
power management which is the goal i think you are trying to aim.

My point was that your interface by trying to fit square pegs into round hole
will fail to expose all subtility of each device which might in the end bring
to wrong power management decision. So i believe we can't sum up
power management to list of mode whose attribute are power consumption
& capacity.
And there is no way to design an abstraction given that all hw we will have
to deal with are too much different and do not follow any standard things
(beside ACPI there is other way to save power brightness, gpu/memory
clock, pll, ...) so i don't see how one might give a common view of things
which are fundamentally different in how they affect consumption (same end
result with many different paths leading to it).
best,
