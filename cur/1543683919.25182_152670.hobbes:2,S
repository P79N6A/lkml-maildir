Hmm.  Sounds like you're loosing interrupts. This can happen due to
poorly behaving drivers (disabling interrupts for too long), or odd
hardware. The change from HZ=100 to HZ=1000 probably made this more
visible on your box, so could you try setting HZ back to 100 and see if
that helps (you may still lose time, but at a much slower rate). 
Also what drivers are you running with?
thanks
