Hi, all.
       I'm looking at the source code of LSF(Linux Socket Filter). I am a rookie in kernel hacking. I use the libpcap-0.4 which is patched for LSF.When I set the snap_len 1500 ( the MTU in ethernet) and set a filter such as "tcp and port 80",  all the packet I sniff out will be filled with zero in  the last 14 bytes (more or less maybe) . What's wrong? Now my solution is enlarge the snap_len into 1600. :-) My kernel version is 2.2.14, the default choice of RedHat 6.2. 
      When I  look into the kernel source, I found it strange that I can only find the declaration  of  sk_run_filter(), but I cannot find any function which call sk_run_filter() except a EXPORT_SYMBOL(sk_run_filter). Why?
    Thank you all..
