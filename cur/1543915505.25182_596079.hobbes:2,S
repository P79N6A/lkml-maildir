Hmm, really?
After applying patches 1-3 in this series and compiling on my i386 with 
defconfig, I get this:
In file included from include/linux/suspend.h:11,
                 from arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.c:11:
include/linux/mm.h: In function 'is_vmalloc_addr':
include/linux/mm.h:1166: error: 'PKMAP_BASE' undeclared (first use in this function)
include/linux/mm.h:1166: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
include/linux/mm.h:1166: error: for each function it appears in.)
so I don't know what you're talking about.
