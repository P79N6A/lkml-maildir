Hmm.. There's no messages, no at all.
 echo mem > /sys/power/state
does exactly nothing.  When writing 'suspend' to that file, the system
at least tries to do something (now with 2.6.15-rc4 it completes the
syspend procedure; but it wakes up again in a secound or two), with all
the messages et al, but not 'mem' or 'disk' - no messages at all.
