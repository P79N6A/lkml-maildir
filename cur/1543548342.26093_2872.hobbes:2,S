   Over on the freebsd-questions mailing list you can see desperate
   people trying to convert Linux systems over to that other OS to
   escape Linux 2.2.xx NFS. This is kind of serious, you know?
So basically the situation is that people prefer to switch the whole
OS as opposed to applying a kernel patch?
