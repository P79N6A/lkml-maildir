Subject: [SELINUX] check return value for receive node permission
This patch fixes a bug where the return value for a permission call is not 
checked.
The bug was introduced when I added some code in the following changeset:
<
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/diffs/security/selinux/hooks.c@1.19?nav=index.html
|src/|src/security|src/security/selinux|hist/security/selinux/hooks.c>
Code was added after this line:
	err = avc_has_perm(isec->sid, node_sid, SECCLASS_NODE, node_perm, NULL, &ad);
without adding an explicit check of 'err', which was previously returned 
from the function rather than being checked.  i.e. it would drop through 
to:
	out:	
 		return err;
 	}
With the new code added, err can (and typically would) be overwritten with 
a successful value, causing the permission check to not deny permission if 
needed.  The intended denial would have been logged.
The patch below fixes this problem.
Please apply.
