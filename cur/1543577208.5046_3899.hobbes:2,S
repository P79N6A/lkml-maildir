And? Syscall is a couple of bytes. 0xcd and 0x80. Find one in non-writable
area, put whatever you want into registers and jump to the address where
these two bytes sit. Voila. If all such places are in writable areas -
there you go, the process you've attacked could not perform any
system calls itself.
Come on, folks, you can't be serious - think for a couple of minutes and
you'll come up with a trivial way to work around such protection. In a
dozen bytes or so.
