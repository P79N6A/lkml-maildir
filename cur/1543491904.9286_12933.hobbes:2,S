I think my messages 'stuck on TLB IPI wait' that occurr when out of memory
may be related.  If I run 5 copies of a multi-threaded gimp on a 700kB JPEG
image and my machine will prematurely run out of memory and spew the
message above.  With Linux 2.1.132 (highest I have tested so far, working
on it) I can use up all of my swap space and everything is happy even with
0kB swap free.  Under 2.2.5 I typically lock solid at about 50 MB swap used
when those TLB IPI messages show up.  SMP Pentium 233 MMX here.  Haven't
tried --no-xshm but I'm more interested in figuring out why GIMP can bring
down the kernel than the X server crashing right now.  As soon as I can
narrow down the kernel version I'll let you know.
