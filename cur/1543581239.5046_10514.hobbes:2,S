So you consider inability to select() on regular files _feature_?
It can be a pretty serious problem with slow block devices
(floppy). It also hurts when you are trying to do high-performance
reads/writes. [I know it hurt in userspace sherlock search engine --
kind of small altavista.]
How do you write high-performance ftp server without threads if select
on regular file always returns "ready"?

Userspace wants to _know_ when to stop. It asks politely using
"select()".
