Looks like we get a good reason to kill strange reserved names in vfat
(and msdos too?).
Could you/anyone check what shortname is used for "AUX" if it is created

Windows may be storing it as shortname, because it seems to be using
completely separated namespace for devices (I guessed from result of
google).
Thanks.
