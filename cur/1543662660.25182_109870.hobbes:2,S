Agreed, both interfaces are useful.  You see that epoll_wait is
optimised for one in particular though.
Curiously.  I'll probably continue to use a calculated relative
timeout instead of using a POSIX timer, as the overhead of setting up
and tearing down the latter is more system calls which we still like
to avoid if it's not hard.
