Several things come to mind:
1 - don't dedicate the entire machine to retrying the error such that
    everything else runs slowly if at all.
2 - if the hardware returns an uncorrectable sector error that should be
    passed back to the user process rather than retried. An unconditional
    deep retry on an error the hardware labels as uncorrectable is not
    desirable, and not better than the Windows in most cases.
I took a bottle cap to one of the morning's AOL CDs and then tried to read
it. It's really not just annoying, it's pretty much useless. If you were
staging software off a CD on a running server, your clients would NOT be
happy!
