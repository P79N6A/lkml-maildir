It's not realy a graph Bill.  Each task has a list of acquired locks (
by address ). You keep __LINE__ and __FILE__ with you list items. When
there's a deadlock you'll have somewhere :
   TSK#N	TSK#M
   -------------
   ...		...
   LCK#I	LCK#J
   ...		...
-> LCK#J	LCK#I
Then with a SysReq key you dump the list of acquired locks for each task
who's spinning for a lock. IMO it might be usefull ...
