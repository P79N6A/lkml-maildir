2.4.14pre5aa1 has a logic to try to shrink those caches at a better
time. Frank could you try again with pre5aa1 and see if it goes better?
Not shrinking the vfs caches when shrink_cache failed is wrong,
allocations from ZONE_NORMAL will fail without way to recover as soon as
all ZONE_NORMAL is eat in vfs caches.
