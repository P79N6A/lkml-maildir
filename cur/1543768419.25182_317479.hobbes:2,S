I get sometimes 150ms delay between the end of kill() and suspension of 
the last thread of the 3 threads, on a single-CPU system (Pentium 4).
It seems understandable to me to have a delay of <=1ms, especialy on SMP 
systems, but I really can't understand:
- the so big delays (like the 150ms)
- why only multi-threaded applications make problems
- why the policy of the programs has an impact on the results
- why for some executions, the SIGSTOP effect is instantaneous 100s of 
times in a row, until the end of the test, and the next execution shows 
delays right from the beginning
I don't have much experience hacking the kernel, are these behaviours 
are quite difficult for me to monitor or trace.
I am beginning to run out of ideas to test further :(
Could it be that my observations undercover a problem?
Or are the a consequence of the  Linux implementation?
Or do I have a problem in my test bench?
Can anyone reproduce and/or validate these observations?
Any hint would be appreciated!
