For many juridisctions loading from disk into memory is copying and in
some from memory to CPU cache a second copy. This is one reason as I
understand it GPLv3 talks about "conveying" - to avoid that mess and
confusion.

Really irrelevant to the discussion. Tivo's firmware is up to them.
Whether the resulting system permits them to include GPLv2 software with
it is what matters.
