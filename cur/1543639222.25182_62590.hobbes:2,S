Thank you very much. As I suspected, the tainted driver is
the one I use for my NetGear ethernet card (not nvidia :)
I have switched to using the standard netgear driver that
comes with linux and won't taint the kernel. I am now
rebooting and if the problem reoccurs I will follow up
with an email.
Thank you all for the support.
