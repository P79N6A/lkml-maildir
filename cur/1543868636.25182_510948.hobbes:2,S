Hello,
I noticed that backlight support for this device is provided by the
pxafb_backlight_power() function which allows to turn on and off the
backlight. On the other hand I notice also the backlight driver
support which allows several configurations on a specific backlight.
It could be acceptable to remove the pxafb_backlight_power() function
and adding the battery support into file pxafb.c?
If so I can start right now in doing the modifications! :)
Please let me know what do you think about it.
Ciao,
Rodolfo
