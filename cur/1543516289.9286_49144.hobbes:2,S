Andrey, 
Thanks for the ISA Plug-n-Play serial support.  One quick question; why
the request_irq() / free_irq()?  Is this to avoid the IRQ assignment
from grabbing an IRQ already used by another serial port?  If so, does
this  mean that the ISA Plug-n-Play boards can never share IRQ's with
another port, even if they are on the same board?
