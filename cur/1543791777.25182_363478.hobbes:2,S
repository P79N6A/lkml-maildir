It is even worse than just personal preference.
Having kstrdup in lib/string was actually tried first, but there are 
archs that use lib/string for their boot code.
This boot code has no kmalloc available, so the dependency of kstrdup on 
kmalloc breaks the build for them if kstrdup is moved to lib/string.
