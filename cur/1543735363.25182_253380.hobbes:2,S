I see what you mean now, but this is not the case, the new page is
cleared by block_truncate_page, as Andrew pointed out. So when we get a
new partial page we zero out the content beyond the end of the inode.
It's when we extend again that we don't do anything on such partial page
previously processed and zeroed-out by block_truncate_page. So there
can't be some network data processed a while ago, or other random memory
content. It's just up to the application to be correct and not to write
its own data beyond the end of the i_size if it doesn't want this data
to hit disk (and other data will be written anyways below the i_size,
which has the same issue). So basically I don't see any security issue.
