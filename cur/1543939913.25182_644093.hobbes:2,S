There is an error in the last sentences.  The time spent sleeping in
workqueue jobs is the same before and after.  What this patch only
avoids are a few wasted CPU cycles, irritating log messages, and
needlessly prolonged lifetime of a few driver objects.
However, less noise in the syslog may already be enough justification
for this patch.
