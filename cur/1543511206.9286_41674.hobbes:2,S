The driver is in the kernel (the option is called IDE/ATAPI Floppy
support).  
IDE ZIP drives are configured/mounted/partitioned like any IDE HDD.
I.e. you use 
'fdisk /dev/hd?' 
(?=a for first IDE device and so on) to partition the ZIP disk and
'mke2fs /dev/hd?1' 
to make an ext2 Filesystem on Partition 1 and 
'mount -t ext2 /dev/hd?1 /mountpoint' 
to mount Partition 1.  So the ZIP disk can have any filesystem you
want.
If it is a pre-formatted ZIP disk, it's probably mounted by
'mount -t vfat /dev/hd?4 /mountpoint'.
(Partition number 4 gets the letter 'F:' under DOS I think, that's
because it's pre-partitioned so obscure by default.)
Documentation is in this HOWTO:
