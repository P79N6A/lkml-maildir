Web-based - pain in the ass to use.  Especially for people who are not
on-line all the time.
Moderated linux-kernel - lots of traffic, too much to be individually
moderated.
Certainly the second has been discussed before many many many times.
People, please, if you think you have an damned obvious answer to a
problem, at least check the many archives before posting it.
Let us *ALL* try to avoid linux-kernel turning into tens of trolling
flamewars.
