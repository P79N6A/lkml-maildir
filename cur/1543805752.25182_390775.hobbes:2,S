Hi,
I'm stealing thread in hope of stopping flamewar
and finally having some useful discussion.
I address this to everybody not only to Joerg:
[*] As this is my thread now discussing SG_IO on /dev/hd* vs /dev/sg*
is BANNED.  Please continue discussing this in the old thread. :-)
I'm sure thare are other important things that we can agree on.
If it doesn't work it will be my first and the last mail in this thread...

Yes, lets talk about other problems, do you have pointers bugs handy?
I'm not very familiar with Debian bug tracking system and I see there
more than 3 bugs for cdrtools.

I'll take a look, it should be quite easy
and I don't see a reason for this restriction.

Because nobody cared and flamewaring is easy in contrast
to doing some real work.

What are the return values of SCSI_IOCTL_GET_IDLUN
and SCSI_IOCTL_GET_BUS_NUMBER needed for?
Please elaborate as:
* SG_IO ioctl doesn't require lun and bus number for arguments
* sg_io_hdr_t also doesn't contain/require these fields
so I simply cannot see why they are needed by kernel.
If lun and bus number are needed by cdrecord please explain why
(if only for enumerating devices sorry but see [*]).

Sorry but I can't do much about it without knowing more details.
Please provide some way to reproduce the problem
("certain unknown conditions" is not very useful).

It should send 0-s but I'll recheck this.
