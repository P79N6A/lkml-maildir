As for workqueue.c, it is not an optimization. It is a documentation.
For example, if CPU-hotplug use freezer, we can just do
	s/cpu_populated_map/cpu_online_map/
workqueue.c has a hotplug notifier, but we can't migrate work_structs
currently in a race-free manner.
So I vote for your patch in any case.
Oleg.
