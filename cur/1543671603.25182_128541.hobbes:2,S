No problem here with 2.4.20, 2.5.any not yet tested. I'm doing diskless 
since ages, but my setup seems to vary from yours. In short, I'm using 
etherboot, tftp and mknbi. E.g.:
mknbi-linux $kernelimg $ramdisk --rootdir="/netboot/%s,v3" --ip=rom \ 
--append="$append"
%s gets replaced by the loader with the systems ip address. It refers to 
a symbolic link, which is pointing to the real root dir.
I'm able to boot standard distri (install-) kernels (SuSE) this way, 
which makes updating a hitch, through I prefer to run my home rolled.
Mangling a standard distri to run diskless is a bit of a hassle, but no
real problem either.
Cheers,
Pete
