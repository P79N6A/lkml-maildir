I'm all in favor of this patch sine the old drivers/char/ serial driver
has been slowly decaying while the kernel around it is changing.  It would
also make the kernel.org kernel finally usable for the Sibyte machines, so
it's an improvment even if it doesn't have half a decade of testing under
the belt, thus ACK.
