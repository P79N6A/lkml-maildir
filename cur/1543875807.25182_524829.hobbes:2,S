I don't think it is a good idea to register driver for specific
usages/reports. Quite often you want to adjust processing of a report
for a specific device. What if there are 2 devices that need such
quirks? How will you do hotplug and module loading? Emit new uevent
for every report? Also, what about users and Kconfig? "Driver for
usage 0x000012345. Say Y if your hardware does not wotk correctly with
defautl handler for this usage and require special processing"???
Just register based on VID/PID and provide standard
hid_default_input_event() to drivers so they would call it for reports
they don't need to do special processing on.
