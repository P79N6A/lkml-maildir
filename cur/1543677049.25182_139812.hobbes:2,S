It is the worse latency that is the problem of course.  Fariness in this
case isn't affected (assuming you would write the batch_sectors fair),
but latency would definitely be affected.

I think the worse part is the cacheline bouncing, but that might happen
anyways under load. at least certainly it makes sense for UP or if
you're lucky and the tasks run serially (possible if all cpus are
running).

Those changes (like the CFQ I/O scheduler in 2.5) are being developed
mostly due the latency complains we get as feedback on l-k. That's why
I care about latency first here. But we've to care about throughput too
of course. This isn't CFQ, it just tries to provide new requests to
different tasks with the minimal possible latency which in turn also
guarantees fariness. That sounds a good default to me, especially when I
see the removal of the _exclusive wakeup in mainline taken as a major
fariness/latency improvement.
