There are no `advisory' dependencies in CML2.  They're all absolute.
What you call an `advisory' dependency would be simulated by having a 
policy symbol for Aunt Tillie mode and writing constraints like this:
require AUNT_TILLIE implies FOO >= BAR
This is exactly why the CML2 ruleset has EXPERT, WIZARD, and TUNING 
policy symbols, as hooks for doing things like this.
