I like this better, sorry to keep nitpicking, but just a few comments

You say a "DMA to a memory region with the DMA_ATTR_BARRIER attribute
forces all pending DMA writes to complete". Does it force _all_ DMA
writes to complete, or just writes to the region, or just writes coming
from devices? What if something is writing to a device?
Does DMA_ATTR_BARRIER have any effect on reads?
cheers
