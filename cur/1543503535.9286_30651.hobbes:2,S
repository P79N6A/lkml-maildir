Really?  It seems that the direction Linus is heading with
kernel/resource.c would either make devfs a natural addition to the
kernel, or permit something _like_ devfs into the kernel.
At one point in the devfs debate Alan Cox said something along the
lines of (forgive my lack of precision here):  "I like devfs, but I'm
note sure it's the right solution to the problem".

Actually he said:

I'm suggesting that the reorg of resources will permit something like
devfs to make it, ie it provides the structure that should marry to
devfs nicely.
Or I could be all wet.
