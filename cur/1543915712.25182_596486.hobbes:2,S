Yep, that's exactly what's happening. The tasks are alternating. They are
both always ready-to-run. The yielding task is put at the end of the queue
for its priority level.
There is no reason the yielding task should get less CPU since they're both
always ready-to-run.
The only downside here is that a yielding task results in very small
timeslices which causes cache inefficiencies. A sane lower bound on the
timeslice might be a good idea. But there is no semantic problem.
