Actually I think we need this heuristic:
if (opened_with_O_STREAM && buffer_is_aligned
		&& io_size_is_a_multiple_of_sectorsize)
	do_IO_directly_to_user_buffer_without_memcpy
is not *that* compilcated.
I think that we can get rid of O_DIRECT peculiar requirements
"you *must* not cache me" + "you *must* write me directly to bare metal"
by replacing it with O_STREAM ("*advice* to not cache me") + O_SYNC
("write() should return only when data is written to storage, not sooner").
Why?
Because these O_DIRECT "musts" are rather unusual and overkill. Apps
should not have that much control over what kernel does internally;
and also O_DIRECT was mixing shampoo and conditioner on one bottle
(no-cache and sync writes) - bad API.
