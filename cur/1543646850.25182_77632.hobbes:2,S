If they can, surely you can, too?  And surely the subversion people
would be swimming in money now, from all the support contracts they've
been doing.  Also look at those huge profits being made by all those

Hint:  if the support model worked for source control software,
surely somebody would have gotten rich off it already ?

Rik
