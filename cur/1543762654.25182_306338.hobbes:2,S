What ever gave you the impression that it was legal to create a
"Proprietry" kernel driver for Linux in the first place.  I seriously
encourage you to consult your company's legal department if you insist
on attempting to do this, as they will be contacted by others after your
driver is released.

I'm sorry, but as you have found out, that is not possible.

If your company does not agree with the current license of the Linux
kernel, which prevents you from creating "Proprietry" drivers, then do
not write or create such drivers in the first place.  We (the kernel
community) are not forcing you to write a Linux driver.
However, if you do wish to create a Linux driver, you _must_ abide by
the legal requirements of the kernel, which I feel, along with every IP
lawyer I have ever consulted, that it is not allowed to create a non-GPL
compatible kernel module.
Good luck,
