So I was looking at drivers/cpufreq/Kconfig, and wondering...
Is there a specific reason why we have a 'choice' clause that allows selecting
'performance' or 'userspace' as the default governor, and no obvious way to
select powersave, ondemand, or conservative as a default? Or was this an
oversight I should cook up a patch for?  Looks like the Kconfig and a bit
of cut-n-paste in include/linux/cpufreq.h is all that's needed?
