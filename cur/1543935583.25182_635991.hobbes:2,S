This is rather hard, as there are different data structures that
all contain ->ioctl and/or ->unlocked_ioctl function pointers.
Some of them already use ->ioctl in an unlocked fashion only,
so blindly warning about this would give lots of false positives.

Also, not every data structure that provides a ->ioctl callback
also has a ->compat_ioctl, although there should be fewer exceptions
here.
