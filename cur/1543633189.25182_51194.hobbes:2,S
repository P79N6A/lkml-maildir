I need to account for packets on a per-session basis, where a
session endpoint is a UDP port.  So, knowing global protocol numbers is
good, but it is not very useful for the detailed accounting I
need.  I could also use per-socket TCP counters, like re-transmits,
etc.  I have not looked to see if they are already there
or not...
Thanks,
Ben
