Hi Midhun,
    I think mmc driver is layered modules, only top block driver
registers driver under  "mmc_bus_type" bus, see
drivers/mmc/mmc_sysfs.c and mmc_block.c. I think they are creating a
tree of devices of same characteristics under that bus.
I think your driver is linux/drivers/mmc/imxmmc.c where it registers a
driver for device of type "platform_bus_type". This module will come
under above mentioned block driver.
Corresponding platform device is registered in
linux/arch/arm/mach-imx/generic.c see platform_device imx_mmc_device.
