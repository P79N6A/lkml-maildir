It's certainly true that the driver-local index isn't usable for the 
association (not even if one remembers, say, the slot association, 
since a card can presumably be moved).
Out of curiosity, though, isn't there a residual related problem, in 
that a reinserted card gets a new eth# as well? Not insurmountable, I 
suppose, but a bitch to automate.
