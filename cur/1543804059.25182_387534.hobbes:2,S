Ok, I'll try that. I guess I'll find the results in syslog?

It's the first crash within 4 days. I have exchanged motherboard and ram
of the box, so maybe there's something worng. But it seems that the
crash was caused by high traffic on the disk drive. 6:25 is the time,
when findutils and logrotate and so on start to run.
I'll do further testing as soon as I have some time.
