A normal write is a VFS write() call, I assume.  While they're going 
through the page cache, the pages are dirty, right?  Is it possible that 
FUSE needs more real memory after dirtying those pages in order to finish 
cleaning them?
What about the 3rd case: private writable mapping?  How does that work?
