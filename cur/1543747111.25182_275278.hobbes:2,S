that is still the case, as long as it doesnt 'interact' with
soffice.bin.  Note that the same qualification holds for every hard-RT
OS as well, with varying levels of 'interaction'. Interaction depends on
what kind of synchronization the hard-RT task does, and depends on how
the kernel itself implements various kernel features.

which list do you mean? Note that the pi_list depends on the number of
_RT-tasks_, not on the number of SCHED_NORMAL tasks. So you can create
an arbitrary number of SCHED_NORMAL tasks, they wont impact the overhead
of mutexes!
i very intentionally made it independent of nr-of-non-RT-tasks.
