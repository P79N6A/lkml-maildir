That doesn't explain why the sparc64 code went into the kernel in the first
place, rather than being put in with the rest of the iBCS code. If it hadn't
been separated from the original code, it wouldn't be getting out of sync at
all.

Except me - I've been working on the Solaris/x86 code. Should that be put into 
arch/i386/solaris to mirror the Sparc64 version, or can we attempt to 
reconcile them all in the iBCS code where they started off?
