Yes, and that's what I'm attempting to prevent.
The low-level locking mechanism for mutexes needs to have the weakest 
(and simplest) semantics possible without compromising the generic code 
from doing its job.  Setting on a strict pure atomic decrement (the 
strictest semantic) or an atomic swap (better but still a tiny bit 
stricter than necessary) is not required for proper mutex support with 
the current core code.
