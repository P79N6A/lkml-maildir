SiS framebuffer works here. But my kernel does not boot, it stops at
Starting hotplug subsystem:
   input
   net
   pci
     sis900: already loaded
     8139too: already loaded
     ignore pci display device on 01:00.0
   usb
and right here it stops.
Normally it looks this way:
Starting hotplug subsystem:
   input
   net
   pci
     sis900: already loaded
     8139too: already loaded
     ignore pci display device on 01:00.0
   usb
done
Here is my lspci -vvv output of the USB controllers:

By the way, with 2.6.6-mm5 (the last working -mm patch on my machine), I get 
only following PHY messages:
eth0: Realtek RTL8201 PHY transceiver found at address 1.
eth0: Using transceiver found at address 1 as default
eth0: SiS 900 PCI Fast Ethernet at 0xdc00, IRQ 19, 00:10:dc:8f:a9:ac.
with the current 2.6.7-rc2-mm2 patch, I get
eth0: Unknown PHY transceiver found at address 0.
eth0: Realtek RTL8201 PHY transceiver found at address 1.
eth0: Unknown PHY transceiver found at address 2.
eth0: Unknown PHY transceiver found at address 3.
eth0: Unknown PHY transceiver found at address 4.
eth0: Unknown PHY transceiver found at address 5.
eth0: Unknown PHY transceiver found at address 6.
eth0: Unknown PHY transceiver found at address 7.

eth0: Using transceiver found at address 1 as default
eth0: SiS 900 PCI Fast Ethernet at 0xdc00, IRQ 19, 00:10:dc:8f:a9:ac.
It works ok, as the address 1 is used as default, but I just wanted to mention 
that.
