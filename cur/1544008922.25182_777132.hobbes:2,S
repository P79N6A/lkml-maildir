Or just deploy SELinux instead.

It's not just signal handlers.
	while (getpid()) msleep(1);

Just loop, pop up every few milliseconds and check if you're root,
and fall out of the loop and go into attack mode if you are.
If you're using it to toggle between various non-root userids, just adjust
the while accordingly: 'while ((me = getpid()) != 497) ...'  or whatever
you need.
And if you try to disable getpid to prevent that attack, consider something
that does this:
	while (open("only_creatable_by_target_uid",O_CREAT) < 0)
You can hardly take open() away from processes. ;)

We don't mind adding functions.  We just hate broken-by-design functions.
