Well, this is one case where there is crap in Linus tree that needs to be 
fixed. Its an urgent issue. And the existing patches in mm do not fix 
this issue but remove the code altogether. When I asked you to remove 
these patches, you got mad at me for some reason.

This means another 2 and 3 release cycles with this severe unfixed
