Indeed. This number is what started the entire thread (again).

Sadly, the BK license does not prohibit only 'writing competing systems',
but also people who happen to work with people who work on such 
products. 
Since Red Hat, SuSE, IBM etc do a lot of work on such products, does
this mean that all the kernel hackers working for those companies have
a commercial BK license ?
A second point which strikes me is this clause in the new license:
      (g)  No  reverse  engineering:  You may not yourself and may not
           permit or enable anyone to: [...]
           (iii) provide access to
           the metadata created and managed by BitKeeper to any person
           or  entity which is not licensed to use the BitKeeper Soft-
           ware.
Tell me now how it is possible under this license to post patches
generated by BK on lkml ?
Stelian.
