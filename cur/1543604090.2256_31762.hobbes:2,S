Well, but you don't have to call sigsetjmp before every select; just when you
enter the loop. Than just enable volatile flag, that the handler should now
use the siglongjmp... well, you have to care about 2 signals quickly following
one another and similar nasty cases anyway, so the pipe aproach is less
error-prone. When signal arives, select either returns EINTR, or says the pipe
is ready for writing, so you can save yourself the additional select call by
checking for both conditions.
