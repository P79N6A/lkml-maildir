Let's start again. We were talking about APIs and there was a guy that
wrote that kqueue is better than epoll. I then replied that API are a
matter of personal opinions and that I prefer epoll, with other guys
pretty much following this taste. What I don't like of kqueue is 1)
multiplexing of a single funtion doing 23 different tasks 2) has many
options that A) increase code size B) are used by 2% of its users. This
was inserted in the context where I explicitly said that API are a matter
of personal taste. Then a guy came out with "overbloated" and "poorly
designed", and I replied to him. And no, you don't need 47 flags/options
to do things that people di for ages using poll(2). You're pushing code
inside the kernel when *many* of those things can be done in user space.
Why should the 98% of users using the bare minimum API to pay the price of
those extra features ? Let me guess you're going to say that those extra
features have no cost ... yeah right.
