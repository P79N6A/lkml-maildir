Actually the timer itself has an owner field so if the id is
reused by a different process, the timer will belong to that
process and attempting to use the id from the prior process
will fail.  If the same process gets the same id there could
be a problem of this sort, but, then why would a process
release and then ask for another if that is not what it
wanted to do.

I think this is independent of the reuse of the timer id.  I
like your id indexing except for the extra code and memory
required by the delayed reuse.
