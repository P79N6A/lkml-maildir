Okay, found it.  The root cause here was a missing CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND=y,
which means the hci_usb device never got marked as USB_STATE_SUSPENDED,
which then caused the loop to go on forever.
The system works fine now with CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND=y in the .config.
Here's the patch to prevent future lockups for this or other causes.
I no longer need it, but it does still seem a good idea.
