Is this the case on PPC too though?  Many of the LinuxPPC machines out
there are leagues slower than UltraSparc and may not do this sort of
thing.  From what I understand that is the logic behind the
'READx_WORKS' code at the beginning of drivers/video/matroxfb.c.
UltraSparc is fast enough that any sort of software byte swapping
shouldn't matter anyway...
Both Matrox and newer S3 cards, maybe others, are 100% MMIO after
wakeup, and can operate 100% without any little endian data in the
driver whatsoever (except, sometimes, in the wakeup code).  The
designers of these cards specifically included some big endian
optimizations on-board.
