Thanks for the responses, everyone!  I'll only point out the most
interesting comments here, and remove the attributions to preserve a
bit of anonymity.

This unfortunately matches what the manual hints at (but doesn't
say outright).  In the "BLASTER environment variable" section, it says:
Parameter   Description
----------+----------------------------------------------------------------
  Hx      | High DMA channel used by the audio interface.  x defaults to 5.
          | Sound Blaster 16 model CT4181 only.

Under my original settings, I had to check the 'Disable 16-bit sound'
box in rvplayer.  However, under my current settings I can hear sounds
with the box checked or un-checked.  I'm leaving it un-checked.

I've also downloaded and tried the OSS commercial driver (demo), version
osslinux392pre-glibc-220-pre6-UP.tar.gz, with 2.2.0-pre6.  I get very
similar results -- there appears to be no 16-bit DMA channel.
(It would have been nice if the OSS pages had told me in advance that
I'd have to use CONFIG_MODVERSIONS in my kernel for their driver to work.
It would have saved me an extra kernel build.  Oh, well.)

My other soundcard is an sb8. :-(  (It's still in my old machine, which
is now an IP-masq gateway and NFS server.)

Those are (some of) the lines I had.  They do not work with the ViBRA
card.  I get the same problem I had originally -- no sound when using
/dev/dsp, and error messages in dmesg.
In summary, it seems I can get the ViBRA to play 16-bit sounds, but
not through a 16-bit DMA channel.  I'm getting the "best" results with
"options sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 dma16=3 mpu_io=0x330" and the first
("preferred") section in /etc/isapnp.conf.  I've successfully played .au,
.wav, .mp3 and .ra sound files, so I'm pretty content.
