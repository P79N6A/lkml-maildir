Ah, I just saw this is a known problem and there's a patch by
Matthias Lederhofer, which Junio just accepted, I think (the
mail with subject "[PATCH] upload-pack: fix timeout in
create_pack_file)" on the git mailing list.
The problem is apparently that the server expects you (wrongly)
to finish your download session within ten minutes.  Until the
server is fixed you can use rsync:// for the initial clone and
git:// for smaller updates.
