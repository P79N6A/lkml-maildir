I was able to track this down to a memory corruption issue in the
in-band iSCSI discovery path.  I just made the change, and the diff can
be located at:
http://groups.google.com/group/linux-iscsi-target-dev/browse_thread/thread/a70d4835c55be392
In any event, this is now fixed, and I will be generating some new
builds for LIO-Target shortly for Debian, CentOS and Ubuntu.  Espically
for the Ubuntu folks, where this is going to be an issue with their
default kernel config.
A big thanks to Bart Van Assche for helping me locate the actual issue,
and giving me a clue with slub_debug=FZPU.  Thanks again,
