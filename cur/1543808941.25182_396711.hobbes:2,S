It does.  If a function tries to modify a formal argument which was marked
const you'll get a warning.
We're talking about different things here.  My point is that it is
perverted and evil for a function to modify its own args (unless it's very
small and simple), and a const declaration is a useful way for a
maintenance programmer to be assured that nobody has done perverted and
evil things to a function.
