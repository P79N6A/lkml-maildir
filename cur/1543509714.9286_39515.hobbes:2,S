I've been running PIII patches from Doug Ledford since early June.  The
patch was originally against 2.2.9, I believe, but I have updated the
patch to 2.2.12.  I can send it to you if you are interested.
There are some competing PIII patches out there, but I cannot remember
who provided them, but they did not work for me last I tried.
I use the PIII SSE/KNI/SIMD instructions extensively from userspace.  I
really wish PIII support was in the mainstream kernel, but the
PIII stuff seems to have missed the 2.3 feature freeze, so they likely
won't make 2.4.  Is this true?  It would be rather sad.
Someone from Red Hat can respond about PIII support in their kernels,
but I doubt it.
