The size is irrelevant as long as the System.map is separate.  Adding 
System.map to bzImage changes the criteria for what is "too big".
BTW, modutils 2.3.17 fixes a bug in depmod -F System.map.  It used to
extract all global symbols from the map, now it only extracts symbols
that are exported, global or static.  And it needs __kstrtab_ to do it
correctly.  Removing __kstrtab_ would break modutils 2.3.17.

I don't object to moving the exclude list to a scripts file, but
excluding symbols that people use is wrong.
