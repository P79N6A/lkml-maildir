Subject: Kernel Panic - try passing init= to kernel

Here is an odd problem...
I have version 2.2.2 installed.  I added a scsi card into a working system with
an onboard scsi controller.  The board on the pci bus insists on coming up
first even though the on board bios is the one set to boot and is the first to
come up.  (This scsi drive has a couple of i386 solaris partitions I am trying
to recover.)  Is it possible to force the order of the controllers?
When this scsi card is on and bootable, it generates a message that says
"Unable to find console. Try passing init= to kernel.".
Where is the init= parameter documented?  I have grepped the docs and I cannot
find anything that seems to fit the description.
I am real close to getting this server up in production.  Since it runs at
something like 386.7 bogomips, I want to get it stable and working.  (It is a
Dell Poweredge 1300 with a Pentigram II 350mhz upgradable to dual SMP.  It does
full kernel compiles in less than 4 minutes!)
