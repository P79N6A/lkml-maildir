I think Mingming was asking that Ted move the current quilt tree into git,
presumably because she's working off git.
I'm not sure what to do, really.  The core kernel patches need to be in
Ted's tree for testing but that'll create a mess for me.
ug.
Options might be
a) I drop the fallocate patches from -mm and from the ext4 tree, hack up
   any needed build fixes, then just wait for it all to mature and then
   think about it again
b) We do what we normally don't do and reserve the syscall slots in mainline.
