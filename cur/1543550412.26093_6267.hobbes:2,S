Get real: RedHat owns cygnus and cygnus owns GCC so what do you complain
about? It's up to them to decide which compiler is stable or which
isn't.
(Froget about the "committe" stuff...)
And then there is drepper@redhat.com - so wht's up with the glibc?
I can understand redhat somehow. There are good reasons for them to take
even CVS snaps and ship them instead of *very* outdated so called stable
versions.
