given how poorly sched_yield() is/was defined the only "compatible" 
solution would be to go back to the old yield code. (And note that you 
are rehashing arguments that were covered on lkml months ago already.)

well, in case you were wondering why i was a bit pointy about this, this 
topic of yield has been covered on lkml quite extensively a couple of 
months ago. I assumed you knew about that already, but perhaps not?

i think the sanest long-term solution is to strongly discourage the use 
of SCHED_OTHER::yield, because there's just no sane definition for yield 
that apps could rely upon. (well Linus suggested a pretty sane 
definition but that would necessiate the burdening of the scheduler 
fastpath - we dont want to do that.) New ideas are welcome of course.
[ also, actual technical feedback on the SCHED_BATCH patch i sent (which
  was the only "forward looking" moment in this thread so far ;-) would
  be nice too. ]
