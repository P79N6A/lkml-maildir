That's if I had a registered box of RH6.2 and thus had access to RH
support....  I figured that if there were a serious conflict with newish
hardware, word would be out there, right?  Guess not.

Apologies to the list, if so.
I was an idiot and forgot to attach the error messages to the first
post, but it looks like a couple people may have figured it out anyway. 
We're trying RH7 tomorrow; I expect that will work.  If it doesn't, I'll
probably be back -- unless someone can provide a more suitable list to
post to.  :)
Thanks.
