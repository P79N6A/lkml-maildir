Subject: Where are the 2.5 IPsec tools?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/1/6/57

The only link I can find is 
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/ipsec/,
 but I
cannot resolve ftp.inr.ac.ru.  Does anyone know where the tools are?
A Documentation/networking/ipsec.txt would be really nice, even if it only 
contains an URL for the tools.
