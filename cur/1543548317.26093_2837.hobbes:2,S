I seem to have problems with this patch. Our main/central/everything
server crashed 3 times apparently because of it (runs fine without
it). A simple dpkg-scanpackages or named -u nobody gets a segfault,
and the kernel oopses:
kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual
        address 0000002c
kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 32bca000, %cr3 = 32bca000
kernel: *pde = 00000000
kernel: Oops: 0000
kernel: CPU:    0
I was keen to apply it because I'm having occasional problems with
quotas being above the real usage, mostly because of users running
jobs in other machines and accessing the disk via NFS.
This is with 2.2.17 patched with the below plus raid, ide, the latest
knfs, openwall and Andrea's VM-global-2.2.18pre2-6.bz2.
