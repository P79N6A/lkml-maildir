Hi,
In an application I am freeing some memory address, earlier reserved with
malloc.
I have put prints in remove_vm_struct() function in ./mm/mmap.c. For few
calls to free(), there is no corresponding call to remove_vm_struct(). I am
not able to understand why the user space call to free() is not propagated
to kernel, where in the remove_vm_strcut() function should get called.
Please help.
Regards,
Abu.
