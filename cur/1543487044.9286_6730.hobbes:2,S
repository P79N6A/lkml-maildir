If you want to run userspace programs using module trickery, try
finding some docs on the module system and /etc/modules.conf
My /etc/conf.modules has this:
post-install sb /sbin/modprobe "-k" "adlib_card" 
meaning the userspace program "modprobe" will run whenever
the sb module is loaded.  Maybe you can use this.
