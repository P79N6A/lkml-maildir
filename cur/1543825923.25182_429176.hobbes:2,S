The difference between local filesystems and remote filesystems is that
if asynchronous operations on a local filesystem are lost due to node
failure, the application is also generally failed at the same time,
so when the node restarts the application it gets the old state from disk.
If applications care about on-disk consistency (say because the application
is itself sharing state with a remote system, like sendmail) then it will
fsync the file(s) before updating the remote state.
In the NFS case, a remote client keeps the "new" state, which is inconsistent
with what the server has on disk (if server is running asynchronously) so
there is no way to reconcile this.  In the case of Lustre the clients are
stateful and keep a record of all operations they do (until the server later
confirms that it is safe on disk).  In case of server failure the clients
replay uncommitted operations to the server after a failure.  This allows
the server filesystem to run asynchronously.
Cheers, Andreas
