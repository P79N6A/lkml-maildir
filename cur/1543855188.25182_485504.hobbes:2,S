They were meant for things like those Dolphin clustering cards that
can map arbitrary amounts of remote memory on the local system.
Unfortunately, none of the drivers for these things are upstream, but
I can nearly guarentee you that those drivers use these interfaces
because they map so much memory that they cannot tolerate the
limitations imposed by IOMMUs, even the ones with 2GB mapping windows
like on sparc64.
