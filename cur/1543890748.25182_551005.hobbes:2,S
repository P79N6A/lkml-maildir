use 'dmesg -s 100000' if it's just dmesg(8) that needs help.
If it's the kernel buffer filling up, you can rebuild the kernel
after changing CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT, but it's easier just to boot
using this:
	log_buf_len=n	Sets the size of the printk ring buffer, in bytes.
			Format: { n | nk | nM }
			n must be a power of two.  The default size
			is set in the kernel config file.
