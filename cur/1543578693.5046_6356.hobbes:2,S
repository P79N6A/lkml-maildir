Unfortunately I lost everything on my system (the one that worked) and I 
don't believe I ever looked in /proc/scsi/scsi because It was working 
and I didn't feel the need to go poking around.  I had this problem 
initially the first time I compiled 2.4.0 but I went back and added SCSI 
Generic "on" and that seemed to fix it.  I am just confused why it 
thinks this is a scanner. IS there any way to force it to detect it as a 
scsi disk?
I must have recompiled this kernel 50 times trying to recreate the the 
scenario where this worked. I can send you my .config if you think that 
will help.
