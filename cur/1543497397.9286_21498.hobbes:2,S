Yes.  Exactly this is what I did:
insmod eepro100 multicast_filter_limit=3
and it works now.  IPv6 is loaded, and still the machine doesn't flood the
network, it "just works".  Also, the interrupt counters in /proc/interrupts
stay sane, no "race" anymore.
So, for me, this looks like we should hard-code this limit unless someone
with more insight into the guts of this card can repair it?  Having
a potentially higher load on this machine (because I can't filter "other"
multicast groups on the net) sounds a lot better than flooding other
machines with immense amounts of garbage.
