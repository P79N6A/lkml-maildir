I have no idea. (I did try and enable the IBM touchpad in the kernel config, 
but It didn't see it.)

I tried, but it gave to much output, and it only logged the events in syslog, 
as the boot messages where already gone from the buffer.
I did some more checking and found how to consitantly get the same problem:
	- Booting cold, everything works ok (except ofcource my wart mouse)
	- Booting warm (reboot), keyboard failes.
I checked if it was because of interaction with the USB mouse, but I tried it 
with the mouse in both USB ports and without the USB mouse, but could not 
found any interaction.
Hope I have helped you with this,
	Take
