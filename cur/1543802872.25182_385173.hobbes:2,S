I found this surprising, but gcc-3.4.5 for ARM seems to agree with you.
As fas as I can tell, the AAPCS document (v2.03 7th Oct 2005) requires
that a simple "struct foo { unsigned char c; };" should have both size
and alignment equal to 1, but gcc makes them both 4. Do you have any
information about why gcc is doing this on ARM/Linux? Is there an accurate
ABI document for ARM/Linux somewhere?
