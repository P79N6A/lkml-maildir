It doesn't seem to be that simple.
Redhat's init does child reaping in its SIGCHLD handler using the
following:
while((pid = waitpid(-1, &st, WNOHANG)) != 0) {
    if (errno == ECHILD) break;
    /* do some stuff, nothing which could break out of the loop */
}
This should reap all leftover childs from kernel startup when init
receives SIGCHLD for the first time, but somehow the kernel seems to
skip them while searching for a dead process in sys_wait4().  I can't
do any further testing because I don't have a 8139 NIC, but I can't
find a problem in init's child reaping code.
Please tell me if I'm missing something, but I think this is really a
kernel issue, not a bug in init.
Andreas
