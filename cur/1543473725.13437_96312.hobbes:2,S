I sent this message before, but it did not say compile err - I have some
new information though.  I turned SMP back on, and it now compiles.  I
had SMP turned on, then turned it off for this compile because I don't
really need it.  That is when the error occurred.
---------- Forwarded message ----------
I just tried 2.2.0pre2, and got a compile error:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -mpentiumpro
-march=pentiumpro -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2
-DCPU=686  -c -o init/main.o init/main.c
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/bugs.h: In function `check_config':
In file included from init/main.c:27:
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/bugs.h:354: `smp_found_config' undeclared
(first use this function)
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/bugs.h:354: (Each undeclared identifier is
reported only once
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/bugs.h:354: for each function it appears in.)
make: *** [init/main.o] Error 1     
P.S.  I got no rejects from the patch.
