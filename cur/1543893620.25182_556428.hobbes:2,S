here's the spread of the massive_intr results (the average 'jitter' of 
the second column of the results - lower values are indicating more 
stable / more fair massive_intr results, in percentage):
               CFS         SD
            ----------------------
     10:       0.02       0.55
     20:       0.21       0.78
     30:       0.26       0.95
     40:       0.27       1.46
     50:       0.37       1.24
     60:       0.37       0.92
but of course i'm primarily interested is the observed difference in 
interactivity :-)
