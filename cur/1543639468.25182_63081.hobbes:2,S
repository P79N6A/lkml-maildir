Yeah, that makes sense, it's not the kernel's job to take care of the
printers status beyond the basics.
Make the printer drivers like a pseudo-micro-kernel, have the basic printer
operations done in the kernel and have the rest of the functionality farmed
out to individual printer modules.
Ignoring the above, where should the functionality for the extended printer
operations reside?
In the print spooler? A separate process that deals with a bunch of printers?
If this is going off-topic for LKML where would be a better place to discuss
this?
