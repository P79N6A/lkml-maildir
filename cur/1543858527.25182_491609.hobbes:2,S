No.  Did you read the documentation that is written about the uio core?

If you want to try to work on something as complex as a bytecode
interpreter that can handle all of the hookups to the pci and other
kernel subsystems that are necessary to get such a driver to work
properly, feel free to.
But until then, you'll have to stick with a tiny kernelspace driver that
handles the basic hardware discovery and initialization logic.
Which, for everyone that I have talked to that needs such a driver, is
not a problem at all.
