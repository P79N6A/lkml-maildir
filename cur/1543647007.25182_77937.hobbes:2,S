Subject: zero-copy UDP send in kernel

Hello,
I have a buffer in kernel (module), which I need to send over the n/w
as UDP pkt. I am creating an socket (sock) and using
sock->ops->sendmsg(). And sendmsg() takes 'struct msghdr' containing a
iovec, which points to my buffer. 
The problem is, sendmsg() internally does an additional copy (from
iovec to an sk_buff). Can this be avoided? I mean can the sk_buff's
data buffer pointers be made to point to my buffer? or something else,
to avoid this 'copying'.
Copying from one region (my buffer) to another (sk_buff) of the kernel
seems to be real _waste_. 
I have heard something about non-linear sk_buff's. Can they be used in
such scenario?
Thanks in Advance,
Abhi.
