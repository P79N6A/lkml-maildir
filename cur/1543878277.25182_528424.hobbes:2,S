Oh! And! I don't want to take credit for things I didn't write, which
is this exactly.
I merely got the ip_tables.h header from 2.6.20 and filtered out what
I needed to get things work.
So, the actual credit for the code in the patch goes to the person who
put it in ip_tables.h under 2.6.20.
So whoever you are, thanks :)
