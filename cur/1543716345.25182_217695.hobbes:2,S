Hi Len,
don't you want to change your wip.patch in such a way, that it always 
activates on nforce2? Allen told that "The 8254 PIT is hardwared to IRQ0 
on all nForce chipsets, it can't be routed.", which I guess is what you 
needed to know. If this statement doesn't apply to the timer fix, here 
dmidecode change of newest bios for Abit NF7-S v2: Just need to
change
MATCH(DMI_BIOS_DATE, "03/24/2004")
to
MATCH(DMI_BIOS_DATE, "04/22/2004")
