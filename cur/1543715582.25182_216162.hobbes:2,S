Frankly if you really want to bother with ite hardware (the SII680 is
available here for the same price and is perfectly supported under
Linux) you should focus on getting their driver inside the kernel.org
sources.
ie make diffs, submit them to LKM, make the changes people request, etc
(ite is GPLed if  I remember well).
This may seem more difficult but remember the kernel is a moving
target : after six months you'll have spent more energy getting this
out-of-tree driver work than getting it in-tree now.
Cheers,
