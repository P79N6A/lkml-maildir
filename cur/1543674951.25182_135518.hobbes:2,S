Once I acidentally ran e2fsck on a swap partition. It was on a reboot I think. 
Scared the crap out of me as it found about a billion things wrong with the 
structures and such. Don't ask me how it didn't complain...but I almost wet 
myself anf cried when every block had something wrong with it.
Imagine my relief when I realized it was just my swap partition!
