This is exactly what we do.  All page table transitions from P->NP or 
P->P already require a flushing call (FlushTLB or InvalPage).  The 
remaining transitions, NP->P require explicit flushing, and we have 
added the appropriate call sites to do so.  It turns out, the external 
MMU cache on Sparc provided exactly the required hook point in this case 
- update_mmu_cache().
