Certainly it's right for the mainstream kernel.  Dropping a
lock (other than a raw spinlock) does that checking; when a
loop needs to acquire then drop such a lock, that's exactly
what's going on.
And in the RT kernel, it's got to do the same thing ...
because dropping that lock may mean that a higher priority
task should immediately run and grab the lock.
