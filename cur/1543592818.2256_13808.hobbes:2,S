I hate both bad behaviors equally.  "cache bloat" hurts more people
than "cache collapse" does though because it shows under light load.

The page aging logic does seems fragile as heck.  You never know how
many folks are aging pages or at what rate.  If aging happens too fast,
it defeats the garbage identification logic and you rape your cache. If
aging happens too slowly...... sigh.
