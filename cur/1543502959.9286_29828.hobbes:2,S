Indeed. But not the way they deal with memory allocations. The sym53c8xx
driver incorporates its own memory allocator since I wanted naturally
aligned blocks in order to make efficient address calculations using the 8
bit ALUs of the SCRIPTS processor. Linux didn't offered that unlike most
other O/Ses. 
There is something that amazed me since years in Linux. If we take into
account all the hardware, firmare, software, bloatware, userware, overware
wrongware and chineseware out of what a modern computer is made, the SCSI
driver is probably less than 0,00..1 % of the total amount of that
whateverware. But SCSI drivers are focused 99,99..9 % of the time when a
machine using SCSI is experiencing problems. 
I donnot mean that the driver is not candidate in the problem trigerring
or that it cannot be the culprit. But, in my experience, people are often
surprised of the real cause of a failure, especially those that
arbitrarily designate a single component as the only possible candidate. 
For the problem that have been reported, I didn't see any obvious
correlation with some driver fault. In the initial post, it appeared 
that the kernel stack contains some frames that indicated that the 
driver had serviced an interrupt, but the last visible trace was 
scsi_old_done() that may indicate the driver was probably done with 
its interrupt handling and that the problem occurred later.
