Well I use it so I guess it works :-)
The problem is one of transparency.  If a "compound document" is
implement as a directory it isn't possible to simply FTP it around &
attach it to emails without either
  (a) using tar _if_ the other end groks it
  (b) using the application that edits compound documents
  (c) using your least favourite GUI file manager
  (d) using your least favorite mailer (the official GUI one with
      the "attach directory as compound document" feature)
There are plenty of options.
But for something which is in concept merely a "document", this is
pretty inconvenient.  I can pass a Word file around easily -- passing
around our free-software documents ought to be just as convenient.
Especially half-page memos -- they'll use the same format of course so
the inconvenience factor is the same.
In practice, to keep with convenience the "office" apps will all
implement a flat file format.
And because of that we won't get the efficiency of directories.
