i'd rather have all the hotplug CPU code to do this kind of stuff
completely out of line. Start up a max-RT-priority housekeeping task and
just clean the runqueue and deregister the CPU in one atomic pass - look
at how the migration threads do similar stuff. No need to contaminate
various codepaths with 'is this CPU online' checks.
