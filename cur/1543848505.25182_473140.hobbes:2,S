Sorry, yes.
I switched over my "release-script" that generates the tar-balls and 
patches to use the new syntax for "git tar-tree" (now "git archive"), and 
I screwed up by not having the slash in the prefix.
The old git-tar-tree would add the slash to the prefix automatically, 
git-archive does not. Which is arguably a bug in git-archive. Oh, well.
I'll re-generate the tar-file.
