It is a different aspect of the problem.  But we have significant
problematic inconsistencies in what drivers are doing.  I know at
least one driver put an irq into an unsigned char, and passed it
to user space that way.
So I think the driver change is very much worth doing because a
pointer is a token that is much harder to abuse, than an unsigned
int where you think you know how it works and so can take some
liberties.

We will have to have desc_to_nr().  I don't know about nr_to_desc().
Even if we do nr_to_desc() probably will just be a linked list walk.
There are a lot of drivers and other pieces of the kernel that don't
believe an irq is an unsigned int, and just using an unsigned int
makes killing the array an expensive operation because operations
go from O(1) to O(N).  Now that isn't something anyone on a small
machine is likely to care about (N < 32).  I have no problem
staggering the change.   But I see a lot of benefit in going the whole
way.

Sounds good, and that is certainly the level to start.
