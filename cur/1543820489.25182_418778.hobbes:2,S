This doesn't match the documentation or implementation AFAICS.  It
specifically controls capabilities to limit root processes, and its lack
of complete mediation and use of ambiguous identifiers leaves open a
variety of paths to escalation of access.

Is it?  Or it a matter of people deciding to use AA and rely on it
versus e.g. using a conventional jail-style or virtualization mechanism
ala VServer or OpenVZ?
