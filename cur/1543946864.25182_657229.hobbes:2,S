I'll see if I can track down where the page is getting used and have a
go at getting in there first. It must be pretty early to be allocated
already when dmi_scan_machine gets called.
It's possible that the domain builder might have already allocated a PT
at this address. I haven't checked but I think currently the domain
builder always puts PT pages after the kernel so hopefully it's only a
theoretical problem.
Another option I was thinking of was a command line option to disable
DMI, which (maybe) isn't terribly useful in itself but it introduces an
associated variable to frob with. That's similar to how the TSC was
handled in the past (well, the opposite since TSC was forced on).
