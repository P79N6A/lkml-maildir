This indicates that the NIC was unable to transmit a packet for 0.4
seconds
due to collisions.
This does happen very infrequently on very heavily loaded half-duplex
LANs.  You can increase the timeout period with the `watchdog' module
parameter, as described in Documentation/networking/vortex.txt.
If the above doesn't match your situation, please send me a more
complete description of the problem (see "Reporting and diagnosing
problems" in vortex.txt).
This is the first report of this problem for either 2.2 or 2.4
in 3-4 weeks, so I suspect you have either an overloaded LAN or
broken hardware.  It _may_ be necessary to tweak the reset code
if it's a Cyclone, but I doubt it.  Please send me the report and
we'll work it.
