Sorry, but I doubt it's a good idea. First, it breaks the simple
semantic of relatime (mtime > atime?), mixing it with a rather arbitrary
constant. Second, and most important, there are lots of workloads which
will be strongly affected by this modification. For instance, running
md5sum daily on the filesystem will cause a write for every file.
I think that to solve the problem for your use case, it's better to use
a different approach such as mounting separately /tmp (with the atime
option).
