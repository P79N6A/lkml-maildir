Certainly if there was one big mutex covering all the operations, it would
indeed be bad.  On the other hand, if the filesystem/cache was partitioned
(perhaps hashed) so that there was a large number of such locks, then
if should be OK.  Yes, I am making the perhaps naive assumption that
hot spots such as the root inode would be in the cache.  And that they
would rarely collide with allocation or I/O, which might also be naive.
But on this point I must defer to the filesystem folks.

I certainly agree that there are jobs that a spin-mutex is ill-suited for.
