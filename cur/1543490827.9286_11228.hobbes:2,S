I've also had similar problems, using kernel 2.2.x/samba 2.0.2,
connecting to NT 4.0sp4 WS.  Usually, I get an IO error, or something
similar, which according to the docs was attributed to a keepalive
error.  Also, for me, the problem is only one-way.  Going from Linux to
NT, the smb share times out, usually fairly quickly (less than 1/2
hour).  Going from NT to Linux, it works fine.  Don't know if that last
matters, though.
Hmm, /var/log/messages has a strikingly similar error message to the one
above:
Mar  1 08:43:03 reliant kernel: smb_dont_catch_keepalive:
server->data_ready == NULL
I can see where this is defined in smbfs/sock.c, but what conditions can
cause this error to be generated?  When we can determine that, we should
be able to fix the problem.
Of course, that assumes that the problem is with the kernel and not with
samba 2.0.x.
