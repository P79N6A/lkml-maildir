this is the Achilles' heel of approaches that try to get rid of the
active/expired array and/or try to get rid of timeslice tracking. A
CPU-bound task which schedules away for small amounts of time will get a
disproportionatly larger share of the CPU than a CPU-bound task that
doesnt schedule at all.
just try it - run a task that runs 95% of the time and sleeps 5% of the
time, and run a (same prio) task that runs 100% of the time. With the
current scheduler the slightly-sleeping task gets 45% of the CPU, the
looping one gets 55% of the CPU. With your patch the slightly-sleeping
process can easily monopolize 90% of the CPU!
