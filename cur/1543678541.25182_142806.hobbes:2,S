A patch set for kexec for 2.5.73 is now available. This patch set is
based upon the stable 2.5.{67,68,69,70,71,72} versions.
This patch was tested to work on a dual P4-1.7GHz Xeon system, a
uniprocessor P3-800 system, and a dual P3-866 system. I continue to
observe strangeness with the re-initialization of the VESA framebuffer
(character-based console TTY worked correctly), a kernel oops in the
2.5.72 version on a 4-way while preparing the reboot memory buffer, and
a hang seen when using the serial console (RS232).
