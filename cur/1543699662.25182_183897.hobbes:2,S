VmallocUsed is being reported in /proc/meminfo in 2.6 now.
Is VmallocUsed contained within any of the other memory reported below?
How can I get VmallocUsed from userspace in earlier kernels (2.[024])?
And the same questions with PageTables too. :)
Are Dirty: and Writeback: counted in Inactive: or are they seperate?
Does Mapped: include all files mmap()ed, or only the executable ones?
