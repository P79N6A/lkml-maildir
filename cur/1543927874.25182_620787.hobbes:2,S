Really sneaky... apparently, keeping the i2c lines asserted on his
laptop model would drain enough current through the pullups (or the
chip) that the temperature will raise significantly, causing a thermal
shutdown if the machine was already warm.
A bit scary... looks to me that a pullup is a bit too weak somewhere on
the motherboard.
That also means that this fix should reduce power consumption on the
battery significantly on those machines as it must take quite a bit of
power to increase the temperature that significantly (either that, or
the heating part sits just next to the sensor).
Cheers,
Ben.
