And what if the PCI bridge is not transparent? What if it's a server 
with a riser card, and a cardbus bridge to attach a WLAN card? That 
setup is quite common.
yenta.c doesn't contain error handling, and that should be fixed.

IMHO both patches are needed:
The current code that detects transparent bridges [bridges that 
implement subtractive decoding would be a better name] is bad, Ivan's 
patch fixes that.
My patch adds error handling to yenta.c. It's not strictly needed, 
because most PCI bridges in laptops forward all requests, and thus there 
is enough iomem space for the 8 MB allocation, but the lack of error 
handling [and lack of printks] just asks for trouble.
