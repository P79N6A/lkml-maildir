hi,
I'm sorry if this might a little be off the topic, but my problem seems to
be related with the kernel version i'm using.
I have an apache 2.0.16 webserver running on my  lan router and I had the
problem that apache doesnt lookup hostnames anymore to log these in its
logfiles. i only had the ip addresses logged by apache. this was with
kernel 2.4.7 and up. now i've
downgraded to 2.4.3-ac14 and apache now resolves the
ip's of the people who visit my website again.
so what i'm asking now is, how can that be related to the kernel version?
i always had a working resolv.conf.
best regards,
axel
