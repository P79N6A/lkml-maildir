So if someone tries to mmap a range that spans across more than
one EFI memory descriptor, the size will get trimmed back to an
EFI memory boundary.  Isn't that a problem since 1<<EFI_PAGE_SHIFT
is less than the default ia64 Linux page size?
I think you may need a more complex checker that does aggregation
of adjacent efi memory descriptors with the same attributes.
