@Home tells you the same thing.  Although they portscanned me frequently,
they were checking for specific servers and actually deny traffic on ports
135-139 (Winblows traffic).  Unless they change over to non-routables (which
would kill things like ICQ, etc) they will not be able to stop me from using
ssh or others for remote access.  @Home and other providers get around the
"server" issue by capping your maximum outbound bandwidth.  This is
something I have had to live with when upload FTP files to some off-site
game servers I own.
