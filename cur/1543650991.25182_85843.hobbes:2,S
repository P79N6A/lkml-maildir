Matt,
Thanks for the response, I am using a 2.4.18 kernel with
a busybox. This is an embedded system with the file system
laid out by an 'initrd.gz'. I am new to Linux. Can LKCD
still be used in our case ?

Hey, Suneeta.  Can you try LKCD and see if you can get
a crash dump with it?  Also, is this 2.4 or 2.5?
