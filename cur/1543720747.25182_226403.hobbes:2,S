I don't think this will account for the entire change in disk activity,
but 2.6.7-pre? contains a fix for the read ahead code to prevent it from
reading extra sectors when unneeded.
The fix applies to 'seeky database type loads' which...

So, if you and your server have some time, you might try 2.6.7rc3 and
see if it changes any of the numbers.
