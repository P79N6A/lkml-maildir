Actually, following Eduard's proposal, that would work fine.  The file
name would be passed to libc in the current encoding, created in
UTF-8, libc's readdir() would convert it back (which is always
possible without mangling), and strcmp() would be fine.
The real problem comes when you readdir() a directory which contains
non-UTF-8 names.  Even if you changes your local filesystem, when you
go travelling an remotely-mounted filesystem elsewhere may have them.
What does Eduard's libc do then?  Ignore the names?  Mangle them?
Not to mention the extremely unpleasant performance implications.
