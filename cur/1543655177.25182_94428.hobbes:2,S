If the script uses active mode FTP and when that is refused by the server
reverts back to passive mode, that is a natural explanation for such log
entries.
Could you record by tcpdump at least one such FTP session?

In my opinion a new directory tree /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter is
required so that tuning options could be easily added to the system.
But that implies backward (in)compatibily issues...
