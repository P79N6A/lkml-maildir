Subject: [PATCH] acer-wmi, tc1100-wmi: select ACPI_WMI
Organization: Intel Open Source Technology Center
It is safe for these Kconfig entries to use select because
they select ACPI_WMI, which already has its dependencies
satisfied.  This makes Kconfig more user friendly, since
the user selects the driver they want and the dependency
is met for them.  Otherwise, the user would have to find
and enable ACPI_WMI to make enabling these drivers possible.
