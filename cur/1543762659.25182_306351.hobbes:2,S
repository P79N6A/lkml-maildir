Thanks for suggestion - I hadn't noticed that it had slipped out of date.
I took your advice and upgraded to 2.4.27 and rebuild (from clean)
the kernel and modules again.
$ bash scripts/ver_linux
  ...
Linux dd 2.4.30-rc2 #2 Sat Mar 26 11:37:17 PST 2005 i686
  ...
modutils               2.4.27
  ...
I'm still getting unresolved symbol tty_ldisc_ref and tty_ldisc_deref
dd:linux# insmod usbserial
Using /lib/modules/2.4.30-rc2/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/usbserial.o
  ...: unresolved symbol tty_ldisc_ref
  ...: unresolved symbol tty_ldisc_deref
After changing CONFIG_USB, CONFIG_USB_UHCI, and CONFIG_USB_SERIAL
from modules (=m) to built-in (=y) and another clean rebuild
I am able to boot cleanly and load modules that depend on usbserial
I would really like to get usbserial to be a module again
without getting the "unresolved symbols" for 
tty_ldisc_ref and tty_ldisc_deref
