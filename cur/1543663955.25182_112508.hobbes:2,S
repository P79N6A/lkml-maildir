Subject: WARN_ON noise in 2.5.63's kernel/sched.c:context_switch

I'm getting a bunch of stack dumps from the WARN_ON newly added to 
kernel/sched.c:context_switch:
	if (unlikely(!prev->mm)) {
		prev->active_mm = NULL;
		WARN_ON(rq->prev_mm);
		rq->prev_mm = oldmm;
	}
The thing is, I'm hacking on uClinux, so I don't have an MMU, and the mm
stuff is purely noise.  What's the best way to squash this warning?
[Of course I'd like to just trash all the MM manipulation -- for me,
`context_switch' should really _just_ do `switch_to' -- but I'd settle
for just not having stack dumps litter my console output...]
Thanks,
