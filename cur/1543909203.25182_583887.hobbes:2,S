1) Not everybody wants to install git and pull down the whole kernel tree
just so they can do 'git blame' and point the report at the right cc:'s.
(Heck, *I* don't even have a 'git pull' of the kernel handy, and I probably
whinge about a lot more stuff than the average person reporting a bug)
2) A quick 'grep git' through Documentation/ doesn't find any actual mention
of how to find a web page that will do a 'git blame' for you.
I posit that if you want users to point bug reports at the correct cc:'s,
all the information needed has to be in the distributed linux-2.6.foo.tar file
(I'd allow that a functional "Go to this URL" suffices for this).
