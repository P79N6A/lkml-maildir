Sorry, I know I've been feeding Linus too slowly, but I've just flown
into Spain and I have a tutorial to deliver.  I'm solving it my not
sleeping, but that doesn't scale.

Agreed, that's what "rmmod --force" is for.  Patch in the queue, I
promise.  That gives more breathing room for fixing the "marked
unsafe" issue.

Patches welcome, of course.  I didn't do any work on the modutils once
they passed "backwards compat exec works, basic features work".
Trying to test both the entire stack of patches, and just the first
three I was sending to Linus, as every tree came out: well, you can
tell my testing wasn't thorough enough for .47.

I posted a document previously (again) and it recieved (valid) harsh
criticism for being opaque.  I'll rework it.  Basically, its an
expansion of the old try_inc_modcount to be a first-class citizen
(hence called try_module_get()).  As previously, should be called
(successfully!)  before calling through a function ptr which might be
in a module (ie. most code which exposes a "register_xxx" should use
it).  Exceptions if that function cannot sleep (and can't be
preemped).
Why is PCMCIA broken?
Rusty.
