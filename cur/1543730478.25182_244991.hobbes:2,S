Will do, but my question is still unanswered, why stop IO throttling when all_unreclaimable
is set? 
Doesnt make sense to me right now.
OK, will RTFS.

As I wrote down in the first email, kswapd does
                        if (zone->pages_scanned > zone->present_pages * 2)
                                zone->all_unreclaimable = 1;
Sure, it makes perfect sense to happen when we can't unreclaim pages
from the zone.
Its not something hard to understand. What is your point?
I suppose your question is not "_why_ all_unreclaimable is getting set?" but 
"maybe it should not be getting set?". 
Anyway, will RTFS.
