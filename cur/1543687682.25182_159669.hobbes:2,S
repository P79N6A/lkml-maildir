Thanks for the credit, but they're not mine. I assume there's credit
already in the suspend.sh; I've never looked at it in much detail.

On this topic, can you guys please sort out for once and for all where
the code is going to end up. I'm trying to make the diff between 2.4 and
2.6 minimal. :>

It would also break being able to fix the header - unless you like
having to mkswap after noresume :> (Unless you want us to remember the
