Indeed, this thread is timely.  We (SUSE) opensourced the user-level
AppArmor 
http://www.opensuse.org/AppArmor
 tools in January 2006
http://www.securityfocus.com/brief/103
  and
http://lwn.net/Articles/166975/
 and the kernel module has always been
open source.
We have been hard at work on making the code as CodingStyle-compliant as
we can since then, with the intent of submitting it for inclusion in the
kernel. We actually planned to submit it later this week, but in light
of this thread, we cut a few corners and expect to post our first
proposed patches here by about Wednesday.
