Oh no.  Definitely not.
Linus went on a tirade not too long ago about that.  You can search the
kernel archives for the details and long heated threads.  But it comes down
to this:
For user space compiling, the kernel include files should be those that
libc was built against.
For kernel space compiling, the kernel include files should be those that
the components will link against (static or modules).
So, theoretically, a package that has both components should take care to
do the proper includes.  But that's it.
(libc does usually take care to be able to build against a later kernel
version than you're running on, and determine at run time what features may
or may not be there, so one could have a 2.4.2 kernel handy to build libc
against while still running a 2.2.18 kernel.  Theoretically.)
