James,
Would you be against a patch to cryptoapi to have access to a
non-scatter-list set of calls?
I know a few people would like to see that , and I would also like to use
some low-level:
crypto_digest_update_byte(struct digest_alg *digest,
                          unsigned char *buf,
                          unsigned int  nbytes);
crypto_cipher_encrypt_byte(struct cipher_alg *cipher,
                           unsigned char *dst,
                           unsigned char *src,
                           unsigned int  nbytes);
I'm in the middle of preparing for a paper and would like to get code running
without scatterlists.
Cheers,
JLC
