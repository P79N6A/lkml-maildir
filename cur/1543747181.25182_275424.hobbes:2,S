Hi,
I am a developer of an yet another crash dump (mkdump). 
I'd like to know conditions which cause taking dump fail.
It is helpful to share those informations for dump developers.
I have three major concerns about taking dump.
* interrupt disable
  taking dump should be run under interrput disable.
  diskdump is aware of that. How about kexec based dump ?
* avoid deadlock
  taking dump should not get any locks to avoid deadlock. (?)
  I think there are many posibility of deadlock in the kexec
  based dump (from crash occur to initiate the new kernel).
  (mkdump does not meet neither yet. :-p)
* be sure to get the other CPUs' register value
  How are the other CPUs' regsiter value get and how are the 
  other CPUs stoped ?
(of course the goal of mkdump is to solve these points 
 although not implemented yet :-)
Any other points to be consider ?
Comments and suggestions are welcome.
Thank you.
