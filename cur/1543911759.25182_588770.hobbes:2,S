Hi,
Thx for your interest for my problem.
I have try the MMC layer and it doesn't work. But lot's of people on the 
web tell me, that their SD or MMC card are handled like USB (like 
storage). And in my case, nothing happens :'(
If I understand, I can just wait an improvement of the MMC layer, isn't it ?
Thx for your great work!
Regards,
Guillaume
