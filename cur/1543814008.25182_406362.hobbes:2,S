I see your point that an application should not rely too much on device 
usages. However, the main reason I want device usages is to help applications 
and users identify and (visually) represent devices. For example, games could 
show an appropriate icon graphic representing each active device. The event 
interface already has a few other ioctls for this kind of information:
 - The name (EVIOCGNAME).
 - The ID (EVIOCGID). IMHO, device usages are more useful than the "bustype" 
field of struct input_id.
 - The physical location (EVIOCGPHYS).
And speaking of capabilities, the event interface already exposes "types 
assigned by someone" to each device component (ABS_X, KEY_ESC, BTN_TRIGGER 
etc.). If no vendor assigned types should be exposed, only the raw capability 
(a type (abs axis, rel axis, key) and a struct input_absinfo for absolute 
axes) needed to interpret component values would be needed.
