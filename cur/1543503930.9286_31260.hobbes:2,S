The company I work for has a need for high-availability ethernet
and over the weekend a couple of us banged out a proposal for
tweaking ARP (both cache and protocol) to achieve this.   An 
outline of the idea is here:
   
http://www3.sympatico.ca/mwhiten/
The design goal is simple.  Rather than have the kernel treat the
NIC as *the* connection to a network, treat it as *part* of a connection
to a network.   If a network card dies or there is a cable cut, you
would only experience a degredation of service.  No switchover is
necessary.  That's the "high-availibility" part.  It also seems straightforward
to load-balance the traffic on a packet-by-packet basis or according
to some other strategy.
We might be able to bang out a patch in a couple of months (we
have other work to do) but thought the information would be useful
here.  Neither of us has attempted to patch Linux before so we have
a lot of reading to do.  However, the changes we are proposing
border on trivial for someone intimately familiar with the networking
code in Linux.
At any rate, comments, criticisms and/or suggestions are appreciated.
Mike
