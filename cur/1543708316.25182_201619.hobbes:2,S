Hi Manfred
I have updated to the latest bk and new output can be found at:
http://quasar.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dsw/public-files/lemon-debug/
kern-log-bk
Also I am quite confident that it is not a hardware problem.
I took a look at alloc_skb(..) and there is a reference to
an atomic_t token with this being the most suspect
150> atomic_set(&(skb_shinfo(skb)->dataref), 1);
Not sure though.
