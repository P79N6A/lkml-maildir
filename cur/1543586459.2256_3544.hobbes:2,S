	Hello,
	After upgrading to 2.4.3 from the AC series I've found several
problems, first that as several people already reported the tmpfs/shmfs
problem. Also AIC7890 and aicasm problems with db (what about an option in
configure to let people specify the version of db they have? I'm using
db-3 and need to include db_185.h and link with -ldb-3). Those problems
are easy fixed, but I found also the following:
	Everytime I transmit or received anything through my 3com 3c905b
ethernet card I get:
eth1: transmit timed out, tx_status 82 status e605.
diagnostics: net 04d8 media 8880 dma 000000ba.
eth1: Interrupt posted but not delivered IRQ blocked by another device?
I have the following:
eth1: 3Com PCI 3c905B Cyclone 100baseTx at 0xec00,  00:10:5a:48:e6:38, IRQ15
  product code 5150 rev 00.12 date 09-18-98
  8K byte-wide RAM 5:3 Rx:Tx split, autoselect/Autonegotiate interface.
  MII transceiver found at address 24, status 786d.
  Enabling bus-master transmits and whole-frame receives.
	And finally after some time up the system just hangs up, the time
is between 5 and 12 hours. No console activity, no SysRQ, nothing on the
logs, just hanged up.
	I'm using 2.4.3 on a Dual PII450 Supermicro P6DBU. And the
2.4.2-ac20 was rock solid (8 days up under heavy loading with no problems,
since then I'm having some minor problems with every kernel).
	Regards,
	- german
