There is, but there is no known validation of working CPUs, erratas

We have a well identified set of CPUs which can handle PAT and we dont
want to open up a can of worms by unconditionally enabling it on any
piece of silicon which claims to support PAT. This was made clear from
the first submission of PAT.
Also there is no downside on these older systems. They are fine with
MTRRs and have been for years. We can revisit that once PAT support
has stabilized.

The reason is to make cpu_has_pat a useful check and to avoid checking
cpu vendors, families and models inside of the PAT code. That's a good
thing actually, because the PAT code only cares about that cpu_has_pat
flag.
Clearing it in the cpuinfo is just a cosmetic side effect which does
no harm at all.

Yes, that's a valid complaint. The changelog is pretty useless.

See above.

But this is a much better approach than enabling it on everything and
getting flooded with hard to debug problems. PAT can fire back in
various ways and restricting the stabilization of new software to a
set of working hardware is just basic good engineering practice.

Did you even look into the code which does all this feature trickery
based on CPU vendors, families and models ? This is something which
can not be changed easily. It's on our todo list and you wouldnt have
noticed if 32 and 64 bit would still live in different trees.
This feature and detection code is hard to clean up and definitely out
of the scope of this patch.

Dude, we are working hard to get x86 in shape, but we can not change
it over in no time except if we stop development on x86 completely for
two kernel versions. No, we have to clean this up gradually and accept
that there is still duplicated code moving in.

Very interesting analysis. What broke ? This CPU was never in the set
of supported ones at all.
Anyway, you are welcome to review x86 code - it can definitely use
more eyeballs, but please try to inform yourself about the topic or
ask polite questions before yelling at people who contribute in a
very valuable way.
Thanks,
