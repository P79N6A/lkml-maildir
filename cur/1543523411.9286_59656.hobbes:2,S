Dear All;
  For what its worth...
	I also thought 2.2.14 seemed to be somewhat less responsive than previous
kernels,
and tried out the 2.2.15pre4 patch. On each, I got a kernel building in
a loop (make clean ; make dep ; make bzImage), and then tried engaging
in some normal activity; reading mail, editing, light compiling, etc.
	My impression was that 2.2.14pre had less laggish sticking points,
and swapped a lot less. (This is a 32meg k6-2/333). For example, pine
seemed to have more momentary hangs reading large folders, and also under
2.2.14, when telneting in, often there would be a quite noticable
lag between connecting and getting a login prompt. This seemed at least
somewhat better under 2.2.15pre.
	One other thing 2.2.15pre did was completely expose my bad memory:)
Under 2.2.14, I had one suspicious compiler segfault in weeks up uptime
and lots and lots of building. Right away on 2.2.15pre, I had a tarball
untar with a character off by a bit, corrupt gcc tmp files, etc. I did
some testing on my mem, and it is definitely flakey.... because of
this, my testing was of limited duration...
	One strange thing under 2.2.15pre were these kernel messages which
Ive never seen under 2.2.14:
kern:Jan 22 23:26:07 squish kernel: iput: device 03:01 inode 58601 still has aliases! 
kern:Jan 22 23:27:44 squish kernel: iput: device 03:01 inode 289175 still has aliases! 
kern:Jan 22 23:28:31 squish kernel: iput: device 03:01 inode 20630 still has aliases! 
kern:Jan 22 23:28:36 squish kernel: iput: device 00:00 inode 1873 still has aliases! 
kern:Jan 22 23:32:07 squish kernel: iput: device 03:01 inode 57787 still has aliases!

ps. both kernels were patched with:
ide.2.2.14.20000115.patch.bz2
