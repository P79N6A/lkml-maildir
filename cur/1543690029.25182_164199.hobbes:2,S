True, but not exactly.  Each file will need one block to store even one byte
on ext2/3.  But your inode tables have about 1/4-1/2 the number of inode entries to
blocks.  This can be changed at mkfs time though.

So with the defaults, you'd have to have 40M files each between 4.1 - 7.9Kb
to run out of inodes, and fill the filesystem.

Now one question I have...
Is that 32k blocks per group + 32k fragments per group = 64k blocks per
group (since fragments aren't[1] implemented)?
[1] For those interested, the space allocated for fragments was a perfect
fit for tail merging support.  There is a patch in alpha stages floating
around for that...
Hmm, take ext3 with htree, reiser3 & reiser4 (choose the block size 1k, 2k or 4k) with
tail merging off, 1k files per directory and all files the same size as
block size with 40M files.  How would the table look as far as space effency
look comparing them?  For that matter, how do JFS & XFS compare?
