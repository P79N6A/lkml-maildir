*From users who use it* I have heard nothing but love for reiser4.
It's amazing how quickly people seem to be dismissive about what
reiser4 has to offer when they more than likely haven't taken it for a
spin at all. All I hear about is 'we can't let something ugly go into
the stable kernel' then in the same day I looked into some of the
config options...
CONFIG_WDC_ALI15X3:
*snip*
This allows for UltraDMA support for WDC drives that ignore CRC
checking. You are a fool for enabling this option, but there have been
requests.
*snip*
How many have requested that reiser4 make it into the kernel? I'd
imagine many more then requested this IDE feature. And it's an
*option*. Please work something out on this.
