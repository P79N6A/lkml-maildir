Hmm, I couldn't boot the kernel with enabled "semaphore debugging". It
hangs directly after aboot. No messages, nothing. Do I something wrong?
Now I've booted 2.6.4 without debugging.

Ok, but I read somewhere exactly the opposite (lkml?).
The statement was something like the following: "Preempt doesn't need
much more infrastrucure in kernel code, because the needed locking
mechanism is already there (SMP)."
So I'm confused now:-) But I understand that every little more
complexity is not for free. More task switches etc...
Thank you for the infos.
