Hi Russell,
Yes.
The code was written by me before it was integrated into "serial core".
Like your comments suggest, a lot of the "tty" code is now duplicated
because of its integration.
(And yes, its probably overly complex for just a serial driver,
but I was striving for a perfect score in NIST testing...)
I believe Wendy plans on continuing to strip out all this duplication of
code.
