That _IS_ changing the api.  Applications that wish to use nagle will no 
longer be able to because you will have changed the api to always 
disable nagle.

No, nagle was invented specifically for telnet.  Without nagle, every 
character you type is sent in its own packet, which gives around 50,000% 
overhead.  Nagle was created to compact most of your keystrokes into a 
single packet.
Things like mouse movements should not be sent over TCP at all.  UDP 
makes a much better protocol for that kind of data since if a packet is 
lost, there is no need to retransmit the same data; instead you just get 
the next position update and don't care about where the mouse was during 
the dropped packet.
