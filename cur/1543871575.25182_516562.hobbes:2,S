Oh, it's certainly not urgent.  I sent it simply for correctness reasons.
It would've been nice to see the ZONE_DMA removal patches just #define
ZONE_DMA regardless, and include less #ifdefs scattered about; but at
this point, I'd just as soon prefer to see a proper way to allocate
things based on address constraints (as discussed in
http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/archives/linux-ia64/0609/19036.html
).

Why, with custom code of course ;)
