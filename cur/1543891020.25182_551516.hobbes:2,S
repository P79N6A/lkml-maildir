i'm pleased to announce release -v15 of the CFS scheduler patchset.
The CFS rolled-up patch against v2.6.22-rc3, v2.6.22-rc3-mm1, 
v2.6.21.1/3 or v2.6.20.10 can be downloaded from the usual place:

-v15 includes smaller fixes only. More precise sched_info statistics 
from Balbir Singh, interactivity tweaks from Mike Galbraith and a number 
of corner-cases fixed/cleaned up by Dmitry Adamushko.
Changes since -v14:
 - more precise sched_info statistics (Balbir Singh)
 - call update_curr() when preempting to an RT task (Dmitry Adamushko)
 - smaller interactivity tweaks (Mike Galbraith)
 - apply runtime-limit to yield_to() as well (Dmitry Adamushko)
 - load-balancing iterator cleanup/simplification (Dmitry Adamushko)
 - fix code duplication (noticed by Li Yu)
 - cleanups (Mike Galbraith)
 - fix CPU usage accounting of threadeded apps in 'top'
 - more cleanups
As usual, any sort of feedback, bugreport, fix and suggestion is more 
than welcome!
	Ingo
