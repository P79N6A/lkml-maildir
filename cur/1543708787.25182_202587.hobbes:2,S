Of course! Appended simple patch is what i did (ugly, I know) and that
helped me install Oracle10g on Debian unstable (with two other
adaptations). I don't know how in the hell I forgot to put that
important patch on my page where I explain how to install Oracle10g on
Debian?! Sorry, it'll be on 
http://linux.inet.hr/oracle10g_on_debian.html
later today or tomorrow, after I check some other problems people have
reported to me (and you Jochen, too :)).
