Yea, I guess you're right. For me it isnt a problem, This error
message will disappear for me anyway, since I am going to re-add the
drive now, like I said yesterday, I am re-adding stuff one by one, to
isolate problems.
I can just imagine that switching a jumper might not be as easy for
everybody, especialy when they bought special front-loading harddisk
bays for their disks and all, for the very reason of not having to
open the case.

It's not like it is causing any problems, nothing hangs or slows down
at boot time, its just something I came across when checking my dmesg
and wanted to inform the list so I could see if this was normal
behaviour or not :)
