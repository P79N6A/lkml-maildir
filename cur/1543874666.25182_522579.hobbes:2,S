Thanks for your response; I will answer the remaining questions after I've
freed up some space on the USB disk and done some additional tests. Possibly
later today, or maybe tomorrow.

Yes, when I first came across this problem, I had done several reboots, prior
to and following the lvmove; the filesystem-level corruptions remained
afterwards (though, as reported, everything worked fine again after moving it
back).

Nothing insane, just -fstack-protector -march=athlon64 -fomit-frame-pointer

I suppose it's a shortcoming of the current LVM mirror target -- when
allocating a larger LV on the primary disk, it initially creates the volume in
two segments; after done moving them to the secondary disk, it merges them into
one, as the two segments had been allocated continuously.
However, when attempting to move back the LV, the allocater can create two
extents, but the "mirror" LVM target does not appear to support regions that
are continuous on one copy and fragmented on another.
I even tried explicitly specifying --alloc= to lvmove, and it didn't have any
effect, confirming that it's not about allocation, but likely the "mirror"
stage of the move.
