We already turned off the Toshiba extras module some time ago since the majority
of us don't necessarily have the aforementioned machine (see commit
f9a204e1de73a7007de66fb289e1d64a7665c9b4 in Linus' tree) but if this one is
different, then so be it. I still think, though, that it makes more sense to
leave stuff turned on in case it is needed in the most profiles of kernel usage
and leave not so common features off and let people turn them on only for their
special case.
