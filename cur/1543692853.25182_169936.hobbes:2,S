Agreed. I know virtualization is fairly high up on the list of things that
people ask for, and some people actually end up using UML for that. But 
right now it's just a system call number placeholder, not something that 
will go in. 
And I suspect you'll find a number of vendors who start integrating
patches into their "server release" thing if there truly is enough
pressure from users. Which is fine.
