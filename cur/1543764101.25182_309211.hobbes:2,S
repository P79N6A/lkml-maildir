Hi,
There are some problems I have on my laptop using SWSUPS. This is it's 
summary:
1] When hibernate with different hw configuratin (USB devices, pcmcia 
devices), computer freezes imeditially after reading hibernate file from swap 
and after reset with hw configuration I had when hibernating, file is not 
readed again - data are lost - CRITICAL PROBLEM
2] When playing some OpenGL game or starting OpenGL application after 
hibernate, this app doesn't work till I kills X server. - tested on Intel 
852/855 Extreme graphics - for testing try for example glxgears - COMMON BUG
PLS let me know if these problems are solved or not and if are some developers 
interested about fixing them.
I use linux vanilla 2.6.11.6, Debian Testing, Acer TravelMate 240 serie
Michal
