I have a patch staged for Linus, which fixes a thinko in the broadcast
code. It might be related to your problem. Can you give it a try ?

Subject: clockevents: fix reprogramming decision in oneshot broadcast
From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
A previous version of the code did the reprogramming of the broadcast
device in the return from idle code. This was removed, but the logic in
tick_handle_oneshot_broadcast() was kept the same.
When a broadcast interrupt happens we signal the expiry to all CPUs
which have an expired event. If none of the CPUs has an expired event,
which can happen in dyntick mode, then we reprogram the broadcast
device. We do not reprogram otherwise, but this is only correct if all
CPUs, which are in the idle broadcast state have been woken up.
The code ignores, that there might be pending not yet expired events on
other CPUs, which are in the idle broadcast state. So the delivery of
those events can be delayed for quite a time.
Change the tick_handle_oneshot_broadcast() function to check for CPUs,
which are in broadcast state and are not woken up by the current event,
and enforce the rearming of the broadcast device for those CPUs.
