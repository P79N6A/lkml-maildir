The ioctl numbers encode 4 values:
direction	(read/write)
type		(usually related to the major number)
command
size		(size of argument)
Having the size of the parameter of an ioctl makes it easy to use
verify_{read,write} without needing to use a switch statement for each
ioctl.
For example, from <asm-i386/ioctls.h>:
#define TIOCGPTN _IOR('T',0x30, unsigned int) 
/* Get Pty Number (of pty-mux device) */
This means that the parameter passed via ioctl is a pointer to an
unsigned int, and thus will have a size of 4 (on an i386).
An even better example, using a variable size for a string buffer, from
<linux/joystick.h>:
#define JSIOCGNAME(len) _IOC(_IOC_READ, 'j', 0x13, len)
This allows you to pass the length of your string buffer to the ioctl,
instead of having to use something a parameter block.
