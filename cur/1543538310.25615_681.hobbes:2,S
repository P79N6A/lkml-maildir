Use 4K block size. Take a look at 
http://www.suse.cz/development/
 for
fastfsck patch. If you can make e2defrag work, I have few even more
aggressive tricks to do.
[What about filesystem carefully arranged so that fsck reads it
linearily? That should speed up fsck _many_ times. If someone has
working e2defrag, I'll implement it.]
