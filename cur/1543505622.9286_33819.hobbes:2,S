v0.91 works for far more chips and boards than any previous version.

v0.91g has the following known limitations:
  It doesn't do autoegotiation/autoselection correctly with the 21041
  I don't know if the ASIX AX88140 no-rx-broadcast work-around functions.
    (A lack of bug reports doesn't mean it's fixed.)
The following changes *will not* be put into my version.
   The horrible hacks to work with the Xircom chip.  Most of the changes
   have no reason.
   The Rx-FIFO-replay work-around for the PNIC chip from the BSD people.
   The Lite-On people claim that the problem only occurs in chained
   descriptor mode, which is documented not to work.
