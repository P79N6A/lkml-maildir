Alexander, in one point at least you are wrong. That one point is -- I did
_not_ suggest any optimizations (especially microoptimizations). I was
merely trying to see exactly _why_ d_move() needs a BKL since it takes
dcache_lock which already protects the lists which d_move manipulats. 
You did, however provide useful information, namely the statement "d_move
needs BKL", albeit, without any proof to the truth thereof. So, I'll look
closer and try to find the proof myself.
Thank you,
Tigran
