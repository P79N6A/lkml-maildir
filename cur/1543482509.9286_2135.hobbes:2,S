  phys_to_virt has uses in some cases. Consider the situation where a driver
  posts you back the physical address of a kernel message buffer it has filled
  in. But in general yes you are right.
Actually, it's bus_to_virt rather than phys_to_virt and in fact bus_to_virt is
used for precisely this reason in the BusLogic driver.  The host adapter writes
CCB *bus* addresses into incoming mailboxes.  I commented about the
phys_to_virt/virt_to_phys mapping issues since those are where the real work
takes place in the macros.
