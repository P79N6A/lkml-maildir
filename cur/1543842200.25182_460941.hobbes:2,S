Yep. I spent lot of time trying to understand - why they are not
getting skipped :(
But my debug clearly shows that we are clearing the buffer, while
we haven't actually submitted to ll_rw_block() code. (I added "track"
flag to bh and set it in journal_commit_transaction() when we add
them to wbuf[] and clear it in ll_rw_block() after submit. I checked
for this flag in journal_unmap_buffer() while clearing the buffer).
Here is what my debug shows:
buffer is tracked bh ffff8101686ea850 size 1024
