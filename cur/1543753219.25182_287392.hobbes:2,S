Hi guys,
people which developed original driver stopped supporting it. Will you please 
maintain it?
Original driver is here:

This part works fine, the driver even manages to find
your Macaddress and the card revision...

However, it cannot allocate dma for an unknown
reason... You should try to compile it on a previous
kernel version (it has been succesfully tested until
2.6.6 and then its development stopped). Maybe it is
due to your intel chipset. I only can advise you to
run a previous kernel to check if it works.
By the way, I am not developping this driver any more 
so if the linuxtv guys don't release and support it,
I'm afraid there is no issue for your trouble...
Cheers,
Dany Salman
