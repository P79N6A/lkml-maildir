The patches pointed out at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/15/125
 aimed to
introduce static probes in the form of kernel markers in the futex
subsystem. Apart from tracing function boundaries and return values,
they were intended to be helpful in gathering performance measurements
and turn-around times for futex operations.
The patches did not elicit a favourable response then, and haven't been
converted to tracepoints (owing to the format string parameter
requirements for trace_mark and the fine-granular information being
exported by the proposed markers). I doubt if the community opinion has
changed now to accept the patch, if converted to tracepoints.
On a related note, just thinking if the proposed marker patch submission
from Google (
http://lwn.net/Articles/298685/
) has been sent to/accepted by
the community folks? It would be interesting to note details such as
granularity, level of information exported, number and choice of probe
points in the patch that is accepted by the community.
Thanks,
