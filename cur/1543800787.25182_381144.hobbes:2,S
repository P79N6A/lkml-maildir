As long as this is just wrappering the existing pointers, then that's
fine, but just in case it matters, I should point out that, at least for
parisc, the wrappering is incomplete: we have references to the
thread_info pointer in the task struct via our assembly glue as well (in
just two places: the smp secondary CPU start and the _switch_to
implementation).
