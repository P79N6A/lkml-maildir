This patchlet was selectively taken from the latest pcmcia-cs
(3.1.21-beta).  It made my NIC work correctly - without this patch the
Xircom NIC incorrectly enters half-duplex mode with disastrous
performance consequences.
But it broke yours completely, so I guess the hunk should be backed out
until David has a chance to do a full merge.  Are you able to test with
the latest pcmcia-cs package?
A number of people (esp. David) have spent a lot of time trying to make
the Xircom driver work correctly.  It's being a real problem.
