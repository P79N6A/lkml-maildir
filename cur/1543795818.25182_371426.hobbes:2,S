I've myself worked in places that required the use of outlook, but
luckily I've always been able to persuade those employers to let me
use other MUA's as long as they were able to work with the MS Exchange
server. For those situations I've been using pine and kmail with
success. Would that be an option for you?  pine will even run on
Windows if that's a corporate requirement as well.

Since I don't use Outlook myself I don't really know. But I wen't
googling and found a few links that perhaps can help you.

Please note that I'm not recommending anything mentioned in those
documents, I've never used those methods and I've barely ever touched
Outlook, they are just the result of a quick google search.
