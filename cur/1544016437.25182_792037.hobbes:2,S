Yes, after some more research, I found that the bug is indeed triggered by
the struct klist being aligned to odd bytes inside other structs.
Since CRIS uses packed structs, having a char * inside the kobjects
shifts the alignment for all data after any struct that contains
a kobject (and indeed inside the kobject itself)
In this case it was the class pointer of the struct device
that had a klist in the private pointer (struct class_private),
after a struct kset (which contains a kobject).

Actually, it seems that the default is for objects to be aligned
at 16bits for CRIS, which may also explain why this is not seen more often.
Objects allocated dynamically may still trigger the bug, due to
the struct not being padded.
