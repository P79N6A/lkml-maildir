Technically, ACPI knows only about devices that are soldered onto
the motherboard when the BIOS is flashed.
So ACPI wouldn't be able to help you find this table
when you put in an iSCSI card -- unless there were some arrangement
between the motherboard BIOS and the add-in card BIOS extension,
say, to have a dummy table that gets filled in or something.
Yes, OpenFirmware is extensible via add-in cards -- assuming
they support OpenFirmware -- so in theory they could do this right
even in the add-in case.
I wouldn't object to a platform hook to make the IBFT appear as just another
ACPI table available in /sys/firmware/acpi.  But that woudln't help
a system that has IBFT but doesn't have ACPI, so it doesn't
really solve the general problem.
For tables such as this,
ACPI is just the messenger anyway, we don't know anything about
the content of the table, just about the envelope around it
and how to find the envelope.  In this case, we don't even
know how to find the envelope, so ACPI doesn't add much
value to the IBFT.
In summary, I think IBFT should depend on iSCSI alone,
and not involve ACPI at all.
