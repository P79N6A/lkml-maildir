I've been working on this in 2.5 this week - I've got something working,
Alan's happy with the concept as far as the resource allocation goes.
The cardbus reservation method is actually flawed in setup-*.c if you
want to get rid of the stuff in yenta.c - again, I've fixed this lot
in my 2.5 tree already, and the patch is pending an update to the x86
code to do what yenta.c was doing (only setup bridge resources of the
ones already programmed are bad/wrong.)
