I see inconsistency here: in dependent_sleeper() function, you argued dearly
that it is important to be bully for the high priority task to kick off low
priority task on the sibling CPU.  Here you are arguing dearly to put the
delayed low priority sleeper back onto the CPU as early as possible (and it
would possibly competing with the other high priority task).  Having such
biased opposite treatment in different path doesn't look correct to me.
