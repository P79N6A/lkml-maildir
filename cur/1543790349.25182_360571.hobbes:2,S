What are the requirements that preclude a conventional rwlock?  If you
don't have any, then you should go with that.
The other solutions I've mentioned before.
Copy on read.
Various lock-free schemes:
SMR hazard pointers
RCU+SMR (probably overkill since you don't need the read side performance)
reference counting
proxy reference counting
The last would probably be the easiest to implement expecially if you used
a spinlock to safely increment the reference count without the more complicated
atomic thread-safety.  It's also more self contained.
User land implementations of most of the above can be found at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/atomic-ptr-plus/
The proxy refcounting stuff is in the atomic-ptr-plus package.  It's
in c++ but you should be able to figure it out.
RCU+SMR is in the fastsmr package.
