During this weekend I did several tests around SMP and UP, and I can definitely
confirm the box does not crash under rc2-UP kernel, but collapses within hours
under rc2-SMP.

I spent half the weekend to turn the setup from reiserfs over to ext3
completely preserving the data. The box runs now with rc2-SMP-ext3 (no reiserfs
present any longer). I will send notice if/when it crashes.
From looking at the tests so far I would say the setup is remarkably slower in
terms of writing to ext3 via nfs and sync option set. I think especially the
"sync" is very visible - unlike reiserfs.
