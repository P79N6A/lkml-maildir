I am having a problem with a dual PIII CPU.
One of my PCI boards is mapped to irq 9 as edge triggered.  I have
other PCI boards which are mapped to the higher irqs and are all
level - these all work OK.  I searched the l-k archives for a similar
problem and found one almost identical (9 Jul 1999).  A patch was
mentioned which allows a kernel option to force an irq to:
  ioapic_level=9
or
  xtpci=9
Does anyone know where to find this patch?
Any other suggestions?
Wm
