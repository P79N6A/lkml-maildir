I still don't see what is wrong with something like
/* ... block SIGWHATEVER ... */
prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGWHATEVER);
/* Were we orphaned before the prctl? */
if (__getppid() == 1)
        __kill(__getpid(), SIGWHATEVER);
/* ... now unblock SIGWHATVER ... */
(If performance is a real issue, the block/unblock can be avoided by
using an atomic test-and-set, in which case just two system calls are
needed.)
We have the functionality already, so why take up valuable bits in the
clone() flags word?
