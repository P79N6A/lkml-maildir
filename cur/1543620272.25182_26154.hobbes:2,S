I would like to change the API for autofs on 64-bit systems, *except*
Alpha, MIPS64 and SPARC64.  As far as I count, this means IA-64,
S/390x and x86-64.
The problem is that current setup doesn't work well with the emulation
layer; currently this is special-cased for MIPS64 and Sparc64, but the
other 64-bit architectures didn't follow suit.
How much pain or lack thereof will this cause?  In particular, IA-64
seems to be one which just may want to pass on this, otherwise I'll
expect to send this patch to Linus and Marcelo as well as make an
autofs 3.1.8 with this patch in it:

  * If so, 32-bit user-space code should be backwards compatible.
