It's often the case, but I try to reset it, and use the bios to read
from it, because there are more chances here than from a solid hung kernel.

I think this a quite a good idea which could be applied particularly to
RAW dump (because some people who want FAT prefer not to bother how to
"cook" the diskette). But this could be included as a compile-time option,
IMO.
I'm currently working on the 0.3 release and it now gives an interactive menu
on a blue screen ... I'll think about including this feature in the same
release.
