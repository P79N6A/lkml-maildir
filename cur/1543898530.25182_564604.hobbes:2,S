Well, it generally needs more consideration. :-)
I think that we should introduce mechanisms that will allow us to notify all
kernel subsystems, including FUSE and similar, that the system is going to
enter a sleep state (one of those is the notifier chain introduced recently).
Then, they may react to such a notification by entering a "suspend" mode
of operation in which they will return errors from some callbacks that
otherwise should have succeeded etc.  That depends on the subsystem in
question.
