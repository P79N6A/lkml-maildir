Agreed, except that I do not have the time for this right now. I want
to get lm-sensors-3.0.0 ready for a release candidate first. What
really matters for this is to get the API ready. Implementation details
will come later.

I don't know of any 2.6-based distro not mounting sysfs at /sys, but I
know of 2.4-based distros not mounting sysfs at all ;) libsensors
supports both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, so being able to tell whether sysfs
is mounted or not, matters.

I think so, yes. To the best of my knowledge, it has worked on all
Unix-like systems for decades. There are other ways, but this is by far
the less expensive.

Maybe getmntent(3)? Sure I could use this, but how expensive compared
to a single stat(2).

Really? I'm curious how such distributions support libsensors and the
other tools which still rely on libsysfs. If they have already
converted libsensors for me, that would be good news :)

Tejun already fixed it, that was quick :)
