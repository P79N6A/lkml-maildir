Hi all,
some upates about this issue (see also bug 9147 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9147
 ).
The 'ac', 'battery' and 'thermal' modules (compiled as stand-alone) do 
cause the bug; it suffices that one of them (or any set of them) is 
loaded to trigger the bug either immediately or after some time.
If none of them is loaded into memory, the bug does not happen.
Also, the 'battery' module does not generate system messages although 
the problem is equally verified.
The 'thermal' module instead, when loaded with 'modprobe thermal', 
causes the enter key pressed to execute the command to be indefinitively 
repeated into any terminal. This is currently a perfectly reproducible 
testcase for bug 9147.
The bug has been confirmed by at least another user (with different 
hardware configuration); please reply for either bug addressing or 
confirmation.
The current known best workaround to this bug is to compile all the 
above mentioned ACPI modules as stand-alone and to not (auto)load them 
(loosing their vital functionalities, since we are talking about laptops 
here, see 
http://gentoo-wiki.com/HARDWARE_Maxdata_Pro_7000_DX
 for an 
example of affected hardware).
It is also important to note that this bug always comes with bug 8740 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8740
 (also confirmed and also 
an ACPI issue).
Best regards,
