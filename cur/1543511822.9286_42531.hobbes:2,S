OK, I looked into this and it seems some Ascend NASs will advertise a max
mru of 1524 when they really mean 1500, and will throw the packets on the
floor silently, without fragmenting them (or sending ICMP_FRAGNEEDED if DF
is set). I /was/ talking to such a box, but fixing the mtu at 1500 locally
doesn't solve my original problem.

I tried this too and it seems to help, but I think it's masking the problem
rather than curing it. I'll go grab some more info (tcpdumps and the
RetransSegs count from /proc/net/snmp) and see..
