OK, this is where I start to worry. Swap prefetch AFAIKS doesn't fix
the updatedb problem very well, because if updatedb has caused swapout
then it has filled memory, and swap prefetch doesn't run unless there
is free memory (not to mention that updatedb would have paged out other
files as well).
And drop behind doesn't fix your usual problem where you are downloading
from a server, because that is use-once write(2) data which is the
problem. And this readahead-based drop behind also doesn't help if data
you were reading happened to be a sequence of small files, or otherwise
not in good readahead order.
Not to say that neither fix some problems, but for such conceptually
big changes, it should take a little more effort than a constructed test
case and no consideration of the alternatives to get it merged.
