Subject: 2.5.48 hangs during boot

Hello all,
	2.5.48 + Bill/Martin's noearlyirq patch hangs on boot on our NUMA-Q 
machines.  It boots normally up to
TCP: Hash tables configured (established 524288 bind 65536)
NET4: Unix domain sockets 1.0/SMP for Linux NET4.0.
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 268k freed
Then it *VERY* slowly proceeds to output a few more lines before hanging 
completely.  The lines come out one at a time, with large time delays 
between each line.  The last bit of output I get is the enabling swap line.
The -mm1 patch fixes this problem, and I'm in the process of determining 
exactly what fixes it.  Any input/ideas would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
-Matt
