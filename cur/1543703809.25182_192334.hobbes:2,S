Indeed you are correct, the final (totaldigits == 1) test can be removed.
Good catch.
However, IMHO you added too many comments.  Unlike Andrew, I do believe
one can have too many comments.  Comments become 'too many' when they
dilute to the point that the code can no longer be clearly read.
If you reduce the comments to just those that say something not easily
deduced from the code, then they would be acceptable to me, and would
make a useful addition IMO.  That would be all but three, or perhaps four,
of them.
Andrew, if you do like the fully commented version, then please remove
my name from the comment in the patch.  The dilute style of coding is
not one I wish to have my name associated with.
Thanks,
Joe
