several oopses are marked as "Not tainted".
Anyway, your hardware might be flakey.
Run memtest86 overnight and some of
cpuburn tools too. Do heavy PCI traffic
(dd your disk to /dev/null, flood
your ethernet, etc).
Underclock your system and/or set lower
IDE DMA mode and see whether it stops oopsing.
