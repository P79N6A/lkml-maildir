To use "notsc" I had to set CONFIG_X86_TSC_DISABLE=y , but then init
fails (booting stops after freeing some kernel memory). Configure.help
says one has to install a TSC-checking glibc if that happens; I 
installed the latest glibc-2.2.4-31 from redhat/7.2/updates but still
init fails. Are there RH7.2 compatible versions of glibc which are
TSC-checking?
I also tried 
echo 01 >/proc/irq/0/smp_affinity
and it seems to improve the situation but I'm not sure if this is a good
workaround.
