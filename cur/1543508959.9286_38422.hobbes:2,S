Hey, everyone.  This is my first post to the mailing list.
One of my machines here runs kernel 2.2.12 and has two network cards in it. 
This, of course, requires that I modify drivers/net/Space.c each time I
download a new kernel.
So I wrote a patch to incorporate this into the configuration (make menuconfig,
etc.).  This patch is available at:
http://hypocrite.org/linux/patch-multinic-2.2.12
This is the result of doing diff -urN linux linux-2.2.12  where linux-2.2.12
was my modified code.
I modified Space.c in drivers/net and modified a couple of Makefiles.  This
patch is likely not the simplest way of doing this but I did check it out and
it did seem to work.  Note that I completely ignored modularised ethernet nic
cards.  It may or may not work under those conditions.
Please take a look and fix it up if necessary.
