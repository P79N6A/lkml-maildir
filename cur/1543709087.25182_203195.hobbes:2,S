Well, the AGP problem is black magic to me. Those hangs / reboots happen
during the copying of the original kernel back (when S4 is concerned) and
that's completely beyond me, sorry.
I did try to look into the USB problem back then, but again, I couldn't
find anything significantly different between 2.4 and 2.6, so I backed out.
Anyway, you're still right about that one should fix it instead of
complaining...
