And it's a good point, too, because often problems to one person are a
no-brainer to someone else.
Creating lots of "fake" disks is trivial to do, IMO.  Use loopback on sparse
files containing sparse filesxi, use ramdisks containing sparse files or write a
sparse dm target for sparse block device mapping, etc. I'm sure there's more than the
few I just threw out...
Cheers,
Dave.
