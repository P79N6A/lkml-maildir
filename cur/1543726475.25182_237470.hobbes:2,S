Woops, looks like Arjan's patch is missed a little piece of
the code there when going throug the forward port...

Well, the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK is a per-process limit anyway so the
total amount of memory a user can mlock isn't really limited
by it.  The user_struct itself just gets the same limit as each
of the user's processes, to account for memory that doesn't
have the same life time as processes.

Ok, cool ;)
