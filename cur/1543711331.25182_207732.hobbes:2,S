That would get nasty, it's much more natural to track it from the other
end. I view it as a dm (or whatever problem) that they need to track who
has pending io on their behalf, which is pretty easy to to from eg
__map_bio().
The only addition is putting the old q->plug_list back, but using it on
stacking drivers like dm. dm then maintains a per-dm plugged list that
it can use when dm_unplug() runs.
