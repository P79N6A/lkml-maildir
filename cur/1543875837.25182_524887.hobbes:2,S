yup.

There are two main metrics:
a) the number of bugs which Adrian is tracking.  I think this still
   exceeds 25, which is a lot.
b) the rate at which fixes are arriving.  I have accumulated 15-20
   since the last batch (40 hours ago), which is still a pretty high rate.
Based on that, we're still quite a long way from -final.
(But you know me - I'd be happy releasing 2.6.21 in July)
(Don't ask me what year I'm referring to, either)
There is another metric to look at, too: the number of fixes which are
going into 2.6.x.y.  If that fix count is high, and if those fixes fix bugs
which were not present in 2.6.x-1 then this is an indication that something
is wrong - many regressions are sneaking through the -rc process.
And I haven't run the numbers, but I get the impression that 2.6.20.x has
an unusually large number of fixes in it.
