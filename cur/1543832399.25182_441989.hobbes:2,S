I will leave Neil to explain this to you, it appears to be a totally 
different case for reconfiguration, but I don't pretend to understand 
the code well enough to clarify it.

I'm not sure that building the RAID into the filesystem is ever a good 
idea, it certainly seems likely to either prevent certain RAID devices 
from being used, or make them perform suboptimally. There are times when 
  being able to move a filesystem to a new device is REALLY useful, and 
byte copy is more practical than file by file copy.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
