I've only seen these against 2.4, right?

Well, Apache could definitely be the "issue" if it is using CPU time:
more time to Apache and less time to the compiles, assumingly by
design.  To really test kernel preemption's impact on throughput, you
need an idle system, otherwise you also test the improved preemptibility
and fairness.
