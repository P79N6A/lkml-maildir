I will tell you where your overhead is. The overhead in doing
things like that is in repopulating the cache after each context
switch. When you have two gcc's running on a fairly large data
set, the cache on your processor will be useless after a context
switch (since the data of the previous process is there and not
the data of the current process).
The scheduling overhead is minute compared to the cache misses
each context swich brings you.

To minimise the cache miss performance hit, while doing multiple compiles,
I modify the scheduler to reduce the frequency of scheduler calls (and
resultant context switch overhead drops). It doesn't help much on my old
486/100 though.
