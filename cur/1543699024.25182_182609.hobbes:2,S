You don't mention the kernel version--I'm guessing a 2.4.x?
This doesn't necessarily help you, but: I haven't seen that on a dual P3
with 3GB of RAM (configured with CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y and
CONFIG_HIGHIO=y) and an AcceleRAID 352, in 2.4.22.  (I did get oopses with
this card and 3GB in 2.2 kernel days, using the old bigmem patches for 2.2.
I didn't stick around to find out whose fault it was though, just dropped
back to 2GB)
So, try verifying you've got CONFIG_HIGHIO=y, and out of curiosity you
could try mem=3072, but if that doesn't help I'd suspect the motherboard. 
This box is... um... an Intel serverworks board whose exact model number
escapes me at the moment.
