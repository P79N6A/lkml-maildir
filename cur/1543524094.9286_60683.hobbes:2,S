I am experiencing a problem with the 2.3.41 kernel.   This problem has now
occured twice today.   I have two IDE hard drives on my system and the problem
seems to happen when both are being used simultaneously.   Here is how I get the
problem to happen:
1.  I have stuff running in the background accessing /dev/hdb
2.  I start wine (release 20000109) , which accesses the windows partition on
/dev/hda1 and /dev/hda5
3.  All disk access stops and the system appears to be hung.   If I get to a
shell prompt or a login prompt and I hit return, all I get back is "hda: lost
interrupt"
4.   I hit the power button to reboot.
5.   When the fsck runs during the reboot, it gets through /dev/hdb5 fine.
6.   When fsck tries to simultaneously check /dev/hda7 and /dev/hdb7 it hangs.
The only way out is to hit the power button again.
To get the system back up, I have to boot with an older kernel (2.2.13).   After
the first time this happened I updated fsck (from 1.14 to 1.18), but the problem
has now happened again, so this did not fix the problem.
Here is some info on my system after I got things up and running and rebooted
the new kernel:

PS.  Thank for the great job with the kernel!  Linux is the best thing to happen
in years!
