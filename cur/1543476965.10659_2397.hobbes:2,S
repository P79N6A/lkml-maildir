Abstract: 2.2.0-pre6 good except parport modules; Red Hat NFS/PLIP mystery.
This weekend I got 2.2.0-pre6 working on a Toshiba Libretto (P75/16M).
The only serious problem was that the parport apparatus didn't work as 
modules; I had to compile it all in statically.  (Also, the pcmcia-cs-
3.0.7 8390.o module didn't compile.)
Swapping activity when switching between Netscape and other programs 
is _enormously_ reduced (vs. 2.0.35) so it's entirely practical
to run in only 16M of RAM now.  It was barely tolerable before.
Incidentally, installing Red Hat 5.2 on a Libretto (a tiny 2 lb. 
portable with a non-standard floppy drive) is easiest via NFS over
PLIP, though the PLIP link must be ifconfig'd at the other end with 
"arp" turned on.  Does anybody know why Red Hat's installer uses
ARP on its PLIP link?  That has got to confuse a lot of people.
