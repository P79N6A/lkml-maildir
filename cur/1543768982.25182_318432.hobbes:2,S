There's no way to do direct-io through seccomp, all the fds are pipes
with twisted userland listening the other side of the pipe. So disabling
the tsc is more than enough to give to CPUShare users a peace of mind
with HT enabled and without having to flush the l2 cache either.
CPUShare is the only case I can imagine where an untrusted and random
bytecode running at 100% system load is the normal behaviour.
