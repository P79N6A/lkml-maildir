I think we should just continue to do what we do now - sure, we'll loop on 
SIGSEGV, but hey, it's a user space bug, it's not the kernels problem. 
It's better to let people continue to do stupid things than try to force 
changes.
So how about something like the appended? Very simple patch,i and in fact 
it's more logical than the old behaviour (the old behaviour punched 
through blocked signals, the new ones says "if you block or ignore the 
signal we will just kill you through the default action").
