Hmm... the documentation for my framebuffer doesn't mention anything
about busmastering, (and the schematics show ISA address pins wired
straight to the controller,) and my motherboard (FIC PA2013) doesn't
support a memory hole from 12-16MB.  So I guess I'm out of luck...
but fortunately there's no shortage of old 486s around here.  :)

This sounds like it would be the optimal solution in my case, but
unfortunately I'm just trying to hobble together something quick
& fast for prototyping and development and am short on time for
fighting with PC hardware.  :)  (The framebuffer will eventually
end up in a m68331-based embedded system, so all this PC hardware
wrestling isn't terribly productive for my company...)
Eventually, it would be neat to reprogram the PCI-ISA bridge to support
things like this, as well as supporting memory holes for older ISA-only
systems, and perhaps I'll revisit these options in my personal time...
:)
Anybody interested in the framebuffer hardware can find information on
it at
