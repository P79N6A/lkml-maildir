thanks! That really narrows it down.

I suspect it's the patch below. That patch (from John) relaxes the 
affinities of IRQ threads: if there are /proc/irq/*/smp_affinity entries 
that have multiple bits set an IRQ thread is allowed to jump from one 
CPU to another while it is executing a IRQ-handler. It _should_ be fine 
but i'd not be surprised if that caused breakage ...
if this is the cause of the crash, would be hard for you trying to 
figure out _which_ IRQ thread is so sensitive to affinity?
