Probably not. On the other hand input layer is kind of a
hyper-transport allowing to send messages to several devices at one
regardless of the bis they are reside on.

I never said it should go staringt into the core of ACPI and
performing some action. That hack to power.c that I did was
effectively sending message to acpid giving userspace a chance to make
decision and react to the request.

What about power dying and my UPS switing on? I think it is out of
input layer, we need PM/system state messaging layer. It can be based
on acpi events and acpid or maybe kevents (but I don't like the idea
of needing kobjects for that).
Still power.c seems like the good place to hide all the ugliness and
glue between that new (or old) layer and input layer.
