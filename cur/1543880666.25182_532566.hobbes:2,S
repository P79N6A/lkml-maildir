FWIW folks, I have never touched x's niceness, its running at the default -1 
for all of my so-called 'tests', and I have another set to be rebooted to 
right now.  And yes, my kernel makeit script uses -j4 by default, and has 
used -j8 just for effects, which weren't all that different from what I 
expected in 'abusing' a UP system that way.  The system DID remain usable, 
not snappy, but usable.
Having tried re-nicing X a while back, and having the rest of the system 
suffer in quite obvious ways for even 1 + or - from its default felt pretty 
bad from this users perspective.
It is my considered opinion (yeah I know, I'm just a leaf in the hurricane of 
this list) that if X has to be re-niced from the 1 point advantage its had 
for ages, then something is basicly wrong with the overall scheduling, cpu or 
i/o, or both in combination.  FWIW I'm using cfq for i/o.
