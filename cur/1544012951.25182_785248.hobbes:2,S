thanks, this was not obvious to me
the -2 error maps to
ffffffff8099e4c1 T free_bootmem_node
ffffffff8099e4e5 t alloc_bootmem_core
ffffffff8099e774 t ___alloc_bootmem_nopanic
the first error maps to
ffffffff809c2de4 T free_bootmem_node
ffffffff809c2e08 t alloc_bootmem_core
ffffffff809c3097 t ___alloc_bootmem_nopanic
so it looks like this is in alloc_bootmem_core in both cases.
