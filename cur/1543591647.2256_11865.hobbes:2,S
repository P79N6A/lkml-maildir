Here's a dumb question, and I apologize if I am questioning computer
science dogma...
Why are LVM and EVMS(competing LVM project) needed at all?
Surely the same can be accomplished with
* md
* snapshot blkdev (attached in previous e-mail)
* giving partitions and blkdevs the ability to grow and shrink
* giving filesystems the ability to grow and shrink
On-line optimization (defrag, etc) shouldn't be hard once you have the
ability to move blocks and files around, which would come with the
ability to grow and shrink blkdevs and fs's.
