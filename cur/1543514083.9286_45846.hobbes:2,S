This works, but this does not looks good to me.
If you start from a BSD licensed software, you can ask the original author
for changing the Linux version of the software to GPL. This has been
accepted without problem by Wolfgang Stanglmeier for my initial port of
the FreeBSD ncr driver to Linux. On the other hand, I have recently moved
the sym53c8xx driver to FreeBSD and changed the license to BSD style for
this new driver.
Each project have had _valuable_ reasons to choose their license. We must 
try to respect that decision each time it is possible.
The BSD projects are very embarassed with softwares they are interested in 
and that are refused to be moved to BSD style license by the original
authors.
Even if I respect any kind of author's decision, incorporating without
restraints BSD softwares into the Linux kernel for the reasons this does
not affect the GPLed softwares looks like unfairness to me.
