With BK this was not possible, but could you please provide your
criticism in 'diff -up' form?
I've done 'perl -pi -e s/-u/-up/ gitdiff-do' as a quick hack to provide
what you want, but a saner fix to make gitdiff-do obey the same
GIT_DIFF_CMD and GIT_DIFF_OPTS environment variables as show-diff.c
would be a more useful answer.
