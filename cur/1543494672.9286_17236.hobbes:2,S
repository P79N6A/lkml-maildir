Providing your DVD RAM is recognized as a removable media the Linux kernel
watches for information from the drive about a disk change (its sense data)
At that point if the device is unused (ie its safe) it revalidates it -
you'll see a  new
sda: sda1
and block size in the log.
That is what _should_ occur anyway. Do you ever see such reports on the DVD
change ?
