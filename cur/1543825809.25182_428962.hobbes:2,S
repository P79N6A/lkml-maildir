Subject: Page Allocation Failure, Why?? Bug in kernel??

Hi,
I tried to run an application, try-sound.c. In the course of the run of the
application I repeatedly got page allocation failure, despite the fact that
enough pages are free. Why this is so, is it a bug in mm subsystem of Linux
kernel 2.6.13?
Any pointer to help understand this behavior will be highly appreciated.
