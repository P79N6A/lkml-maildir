I couldn't think of, or find a good place to put this, so I put the
information in it's own file.  I'm only moderately sure I've generated the
patch correctly.  However, it does apply with patch -p1 to a clean
2.6.3-rc2-bk2 tree, so it should be fine.
The wording is a slightly changed version of what Rusty said at the start
of this thread.

+Debugging Modules after 2.6.3
+-----------------------------
+
+In almost all distributions, the kernel asks for modules which don't
+exist, such as "net-pf-10" or whatever.  Changing "modprobe -q" to
+"succeed" in this case is hacky and breaks some setups, and also we
+want to know if it failed for the fallback code for old aliases in
+fs/char_dev.c, for example.
+
+In the past a debugging message which would fill people's logs was 
+emitted.  This debugging message has been removed.  The correct way 
+of debugging module problems is something like this:
+
+echo '#! /bin/sh' > /tmp/modprobe
+echo 'echo "$@" >> /tmp/modprobe.log' >> /tmp/modprobe
+echo 'exec /sbin/modprobe "$@"' >> /tmp/modprobe
+chmod a+x /tmp/modprobe
+echo /tmp/modprobe > /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe
