Yes, I know.  It's the Contaq IDE controler on the ds10s and ds20s.

Putting the device somewhere in the first 64k is _exactly_ what we
should be doing.  If find_parent_resource can't cope with this case,
that is, an IO or MEM address initially outside the allocatable
range, it's broken.  (I could have sworn it did cope, but last time
I checked was 2.3.18 or so.  I've been delinquent.)
