Looking at this one, I believe we need to do the same for
page_to_phys() - either by using dma_addr_t as the type or explicitly
going u64 #ifdef CONFIG_HIGHMEM.
Patch using dma_addr_t included relative to 2.4.18.
Btw. I noticed that in 2.5.24/ia32 we use CONFIG_HIGHMEM to declare
dma_addr_t as 64 bit but CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G to handle page_to_phys. Is
this just an oversight or on purpose?
Comments?
Jes
