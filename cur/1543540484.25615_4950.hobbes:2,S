I'm not really after locking as such, just a way to avoid altering the underlying file until the right moment. I can't see much difference performance wise whether a page is swapped out to the swap device or to its originating file. I'm not sure granularity comes into it(?)

If a page is aged out of the cache and it's gonna go to disk, what difference does it make where (disk write optimisation aside)?

I like to think such copying is avoidable ... and that's what I'm aiming for!

The main problem I see with MAP_SWAP is when a modified page is in swap and must be brought back in simply to write out again for an msync()/munmap(). This can of course only occur at times of memory contention and isn't the norm.
Looking at the kernel code comtemplating changing it to handle this makes my head hurt! Whether I attempt it depends on the comments people care to make about feasibility- but I do think MAP_SWAP would be a boon to the checkpointing operation of a database app!
thanks,
chris
