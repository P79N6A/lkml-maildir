If you receive interrupt from device, you can establish an interrupt handler
for that. See function "request_irq". If you want a sleep/wakeup mechanism,
there are many ways of doing this in Linux kernel. One of them is using
interruptible_sleep_on/wake_up_interruptible.

  Assuming its pSOS or other real time operating systems one ofhandling an
interrupt is sending an event to the Rx Task then Rx Taskwill read from the
whatever buffer it may be.       If I want to implement the same thing in
Linux at the kernellevel treating my driver as a module. How ( what system
call ) can Ipass an event to the task such that it receives the event and
readsfrom the buffer ?      One more question in general what are all the
various exceptionsor Traps I have to look while writing a Linux Device
Driver.Thanks in Advance for all your help.ThanksRakesh
