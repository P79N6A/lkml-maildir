As for the bugs getting fixed, one of the main problems with EVMS merge
now is that it (as any merge) shifts part of that very burden from EVMS
maintainers to other developers *and* *it* *shifts* *too* *much*.
That's what "ready to be merged" boils down to.  It's a question of how
many problems will be inflicted by the merge upon current and future
development - over all kernel.  AFAICS in its current state EVMS is not
ready.  And yes, it means that EVMS maintainers get to play catch up for
a while.  Nobody refuses to help them, BTW.
