Subject: [patch 08/12] [NET]: Make second arg to skb_reserved() signed.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

2.6.15.2 -stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let 
us know.
------------------
From: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
Some subsystems, such as PPP, can send negative values
here.  It just happened to work correctly on 32-bit with
an unsigned value, but on 64-bit this explodes.
Figured out by Paul Mackerras based upon several PPP crash
reports.
