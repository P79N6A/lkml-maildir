Is there a standard test used to evaluate kernel memory fragmentation?
 I'm sure I can rig up a test to create huge amounts of fragmentation
with about 1/2 the pages being page tables.  However, I doubt that it
would reflect any real loads.  Similarly, if I check the memory
fragmentation on my test system right after it's been booted, I won't
see much fragmentation and page tables won't be causing any trouble.
