Not necessarily, Nick. I have written an HTTP testing tool which matches
the description of Ben's : non-blocking, single-threaded, no disk I/O,
etc... It works flawlessly under 2.4, and gives me random numbers in 2.6,
especially if I start some CPU activity on the system, I can get pauses
of up to 13 seconds without this tool doing anything !!! At first I
believed it was because of the scheduler, but it might also be related
to what is described here since I had somewhat the same setup (gigE, 1500,
thousands of sockets). I never had enough time to investigate more, so I
went back to 2.4.
It makes me think that for the problem described here, we have no
indication of CPU & I/O activity, which might help Ben try to reproduce.
Cheers,
Willy
