 But, not every video card reproduces blue in the same way, let
alone every monitor - somewhere I've got an old CRT monitor where
blue text was mostly unreadable (_too_dark_).  For photo-editing,
I now use xgamma to get adequately-consistent results on whichever of
4 machines I'm using (one LCD monitor, with KVM switch) - the
settings for the individual machines are very different.
 And, of course, people have different colour vision (and unless we
are labelled as colour-blind, we each regard our colour vision as
"normal").  So, what is perfectly acceptable for you on specific
hardware may be totally unusable for someone else.
