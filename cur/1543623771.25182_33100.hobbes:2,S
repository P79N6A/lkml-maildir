	I have not tested these drivers in any way (in fact, I cannot
get linux-2.5.6-pre3 to boot right now), but I thought I would post
this preliminary patch in case anyone is interested.  This patch
gets the aha152x and aha1740 scsi drivers in linux-2.5.6-pre3 to
compile.  It requires the changes to scsi.[ch] and hosts.h that
I posted a few hours ago with the pci2220i, advansys and BusLogic
patches.  Anyhow, I thought I would post these patches, in case anyone
wants to comment on them or try them.
