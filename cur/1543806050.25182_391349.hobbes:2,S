Reiserfs, xfs and jfs too.
Yet they all can't store, or I don't know how to set it up, POSIX
capabilities for executables. Those like CAP_NET_RAW or CAP_SYS_RAWIO.
The former is useful for ping the latter (was?) for X11. I know that this
functionality can be achived with SELinux but it's to havy-weight for me.
I'd rather implement BSD seclevels and capabilities.

I am afraid no :-(
