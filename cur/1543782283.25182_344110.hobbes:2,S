I get this message on 13-rc3, but more often on rc6!
I have use a web server that servers files from GNBD to Internet.
In this service the NFS is used only logging. ( | filtered with cronolog)
- I think, there is no NFS-lock in here
The another tasks:
Sendmail.
-I think the problem is here!
Sometimes the system is hangs when high NFS traffic eg. when big mail is
come...
I get some strange kernel message in logs, but the backtrace is shows: the
gnbd has a bug.
But I don't think so!
I _never_ get these strange messages before rc6!
If you ask, I can send these too...
more:
named,pop3,fure-ftpd (gnbd-only), imap
My system is very special.
This is a FREE web storage.
I can help to test / debug.
I do it too on netdev, raid lists.
What can I help?
Thanks
Janos
