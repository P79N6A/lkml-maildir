I haven't found a single distro that (a) makes it trivial to add PCI IDs 
at install time, and then (b) ensures those PCI IDs remain persistent 
for each boot.  We are not at all to the "just works" stage yet.

Maybe you are just not seeing all the developers that keep bringing this 
up??
Really, it is just silly to think that one-line PCI IDs patches will 
cause any harm at all, and it should be self-evident that there is clear 
potential to HELP Linux users.  That's why we're all here, right?
