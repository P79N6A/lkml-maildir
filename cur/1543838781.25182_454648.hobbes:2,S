In this case, kernel 2.4 is a workaround, not a solution, and the 
solution is to get kernel 2.6 as small as kernel 2.4.
Can you send me the .config's you are using for 2.4 and 2.6

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
