Based on the messages I've been receiving relating to emails sent to
various vger lists, it looks like vger actually crashed - I received
several "mailserver does not answer" messages relating to vger, and
ping failed to produce any responses (it's currently showing around
100ms ping times).
Best wishes from Riley.
