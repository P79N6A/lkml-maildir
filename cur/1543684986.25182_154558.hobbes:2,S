If I remember to update bugzilla...
What seems to be happening is that cu is clearing the "clocal" termios bit.
This means that when the CD line is dropped on ttyS0, cu receives a hangup
signal, as per the POSIX spec.  This seems reasonable.
There is a change of behaviour between 2.4 and 2.5 kernels though
(please confirm) - if you use the "callout" devices in 2.4, you don't
receive this hangup signal, even if the clocal bit is cleared.  Callout
devices no longer exist in 2.5.
The real question is this - why is the CD line being dropped between the
two machines between typing in the user name and asking for the password.
Maybe someone with this problem can give some details about the system
they're trying to log into rather than the local system.
