No, you can't estimate the market share of kernel code based on klive 
data.
Someone said in this thread 'is used by (tens of) thousands of computers 
in governmental laboratories the US "national security" depends upon.'
klive will never get any feedback from such users.
But the computer freak using Gentoo and always trying the latest things 
like reiser4 is relatively likely to also use klive.

You are able to say that based on klive data, reiser4 has at least 
35 users in the world.
But you can not tell based on klive data whether the ratio of 
reiser4:ext3 users in the world is more like 1:5, 1:500 or 1:50000.
