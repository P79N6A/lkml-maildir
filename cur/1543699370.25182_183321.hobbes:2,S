That's not quite true - all kernel memory is statically mapped into ram 
and unswappable.  2 MB's of X will likely end up 80% swapped to disk and 
the rest is in use (and can still be swapped out when no longer needed). 
100KB of an unused driver will not get swapped out.  
That's where the difference is.  As for using small userspace?  I do, 
djbdns for dns, twm for window manager etc etc...
Cheers,
MaZe.
