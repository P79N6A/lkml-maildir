+Kernel Memory Leak Detector
+===========================
+
+Introduction
+------------
+
+Kmemleak provides a way of detecting possible kernel memory leaks in a
+way similar to a tracing garbage collector
+(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_
%28computer_science%29#Tracing_garbage_collectors),
+with the difference that the orphan objects are not freed but only
+reported via /sys/kernel/debug/memleak. A similar method is used by the
+Valgrind tool (memcheck --leak-check) to detect the memory leaks in
+user-space applications.
+
+Usage
+-----
+
+CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMLEAK in "Kernel hacking" has to be enabled. A kernel
+thread scans the memory every 10 min (by default) and prints any new
+unreferenced objects found. To trigger an intermediate scan and display
+all the possible memory leaks:
+
+  # mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug/
+  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/memleak
+
+Note that the orphan objects are listed in the order they were allocated
+and one object at the beginning of the list may cause other subsequent
+objects to be reported as orphan.
+
+Basic Algorithm
+---------------
+
+The memory allocations via kmalloc, vmalloc, kmem_cache_alloc and
+friends are traced and the pointers, together with additional
+information like size and stack trace, are stored in a prio search tree.
+The corresponding freeing function calls are tracked and the pointers
+removed from the kmemleak data structures.
+
+An allocated block of memory is considered orphan if no pointer to its
+start address or to any location inside the block can be found by
+scanning the memory (including saved registers). This means that there
+might be no way for the kernel to pass the address of the allocated
+block to a freeing function and therefore the block is considered a
+memory leak.
+
+The scanning algorithm steps:
+
+  1. mark all objects as white (remaining white objects will later be
+     considered orphan)
+  2. scan the memory starting with the data section and stacks, checking
+     the values against the addresses stored in the prio search tree. If
+     a pointer to a white object is found, the object is added to the
+     gray list
+  3. scan the gray objects for matching addresses (some white objects
+     can become gray and added at the end of the gray list) until the
+     gray set is finished
+  4. the remaining white objects are considered orphan and reported via
+     /sys/kernel/debug/memleak
+
+Some allocated memory blocks have pointers stored in the kernel's
+internal data structures and they cannot be detected as orphans. To
+avoid this, kmemleak can also store the number of values pointing to an
+address inside the block address range that need to be found so that the
+block is not considered a leak. One example is __vmalloc().
+
+Kmemleak API
+------------
+
+See the include/linux/memleak.h header for the functions prototype.
+
+memleak_init		- initialize kmemleak
+memleak_alloc		- notify of a memory block allocation
+memleak_free		- notify of a memory block freeing
+memleak_not_leak	- mark an object as not a leak
+memleak_ignore		- do not scan or report an object as leak
+memleak_scan_area	- add scan areas inside a memory block
+memleak_erase		- erase an old value in a pointer variable
+memleak_alloc_recursive	- as memleak_alloc but checks the recursiveness
+memleak_free_recursive	- as memleak_free but checks the recursiveness
+
+Dealing with false positives/negatives
+--------------------------------------
+
+The false negatives are real memory leaks (orphan objects) but not
+reported by kmemleak because values found during the memory scanning
+point to such objects. To reduce the number of false negatives, kmemleak
+provides the memleak_ignore, memleak_scan_area and memleak_erase
+functions (see above). The task stacks also increase the amount of false
+negatives and their scanning is not enabled by default.
+
+The false positives are objects wrongly reported as being memory leaks
+(orphan). For objects known not to be leaks, kmemleak provides the
+memleak_not_leak function. The memleak_ignore could also be used if the
+memory block is known not to contain other pointers and it will no
+longer be scanned.
+
+Some of the reported leaks are only transient, especially on SMP
+systems, because of pointers temporarily stored in CPU registers or
+stacks. Kmemleak defines MSECS_MIN_AGE (defaulting to 1000) representing
+the minimum age of an object to be reported as a memory leak.
+
+Limitations and Drawbacks
+-------------------------
+
+The main drawback is the reduced performance of memory allocation and
+freeing. To avoid other penalties, the memory scanning is only performed
+when the /sys/kernel/debug/memleak file is read. Anyway, this tool is
+intended for debugging purposes where the performance might not be the
+most important requirement.
+
+To keep the algorithm simple, kmemleak scans for values pointing to any
+address inside a block's address range. This may lead to an increased
+number of false negatives. However, it is likely that a real memory leak
+will eventually become visible.
+
+Another source of false negatives is the data stored in non-pointer
+values. In a future version, kmemleak could only scan the pointer
+members in the allocated structures. This feature would solve many of
+the false negative cases described above.
+
+The tool can report false positives. These are cases where an allocated
+block doesn't need to be freed (some cases in the init_call functions),
+the pointer is calculated by other methods than the usual container_of
+macro or the pointer is stored in a location not scanned by kmemleak.
+
+Page allocations and ioremap are not tracked. Only the ARM and i386
+architectures are currently supported.
