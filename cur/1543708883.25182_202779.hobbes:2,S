Subject: [ANNOUNCE] udev 019 release

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've released the 019 version of udev.  It can be found at:
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-019.tar.gz
rpms built against Red Hat FC2-test1 are available at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-019-1.i386.rpm
with the source rpm at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-019-1.src.rpm
udev allows users to have a dynamic /dev and provides the ability to
have persistent device names.  It uses sysfs and /sbin/hotplug and runs
entirely in userspace.  It requires a 2.6 kernel with CONFIG_HOTPLUG
enabled to run.  Please see the udev FAQ for any questions about it:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
For any udev vs devfs questions anyone might have, please see:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs
Major changes from the 018 version:
	- hopefully all string handling is now correct, and audited for
	  any possible overflows.
	- user and group names now work properly if you build with klibc
	- initial SELinux support.
	- lots of small fixes (including build fixes)
	- update to scsi_id program
Thanks to everyone who has send me patches for this release, a full list
of everyone, and their changes is below.
udev development is done in a BitKeeper repository located at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/udev
Daily snapshots of udev from the BitKeeper tree can be found at:
