Paul, thanks, I'll use this in the next version, which I'm trying to
assemble now.

OK, well, that makes me feel better, as I've stared at that code before, 
and wondered what magic made it work.

Wow. A list of iterators to be fixed up ... I get the idea, but it does
add a fair amount of complexity.  
Would it be easier (and simpler to maintain/debug) to "get" all items
on the list first, before iterating on them, and only then iterate?
This should work, as long as removing an item doesn't trash its "next" 
pointer.  The "next" pointer gets whacked only when the use-count goes 
to zero.
The idea is that while traversing the list, its OK if the "next" pointer
is pointing to a node that has removed from the list; in fact, its OK to
traverse to that node; eventually, traversing will eventually lead back
to a valid head.
I know that the above sounds crazy, but I think it could work, and be 
a relatively low-tech but capable solution.  It does presume that elems
have generic get/put routines.
