Hi all,
we actually also ran into this bug on a dual xeon (2GHz
Prestonia) with Hyperthreading enabled. Without Hyperthreading, it was hard to
reproduce the problem. The following script (requires bash >=  2.0.5) provokes
the problem in a very short time. With the patch from Intel, the problem is
gone (patched into 2.4.18), no side effects discovered so far.
Thanks to Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com> for pointing out the patch to us.
Cheers,
Roland
Here is the script:
-----------------------
#!/bin/sh
# Small script to provoke a SIGSEV on SMP machines with kernel problem
# requires bash > 2.0.5. The script fails e.g. on dual xeon systems without
# Intel patch (Message title: Illegal instruction failures fixes for 2.4.18 in # kernel mailing list, 22.5.2002).
# Script simply executes a couple of mktemp loops in the background, and tries
# to read the generated file back.
