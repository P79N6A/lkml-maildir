thx for the ACK. :)) in the beginning of the week i felt like

here (attachement) it is, first the "top" output (sorry for the
length, but i don't want to cut too much. even more info i can make av.
upon request).
interesting is, that after i killed one job, some minutes later the
the machine went to sleep again for a ~20 minutes:
 4:49pm  up  1:55,  2 users,  load average: 21.05, 18.29, 16.79

a few secs later i did cat /proc/meminfo (machine was in the middle of
waking up again):

readprofile showed even worse statistics for __get_swap_page afterwards:

why was the machine hung with that one job? memorywise that job was
only 2.1GB on my 4GB machine. is it also due to the __get_swap_page
issue or are the "Inact_dirty" pages related to that?
