The block-based view is a very simple one, but it's _too_ simple. It 
doesn't actually tell the user what is happening. It doesn't tell you why 
the request happened in the first place, so it leaves you no way to really 
do anything sane about it.
You can't prefetch (because the indexing is wrong), and you can't actually 
even analyze it (because you don't know any background to what you're 
seeing). In short, you can't _do_ anything with it.
