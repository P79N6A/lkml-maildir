My experience shows that you've been very, very lucky.  I hope r4 is
better in that regard.
If you want to try with r3, take a well-used partition[1] and copy it
at block level to another partition or a file.  Then zero some random
spans of blocks in the copy and reiserfsck --rebuild-tree it.  My
experience is that you'll usually get the files names and directory
tree but their contents will have been scattered all over the place.
  OG.
