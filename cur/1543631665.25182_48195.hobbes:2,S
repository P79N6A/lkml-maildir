Sure there is.
What happens _now_ happens in an interrupt, which means that it had better
be in a kernel module. And yes, you can (and apparently do) add low-level
task switching etc, at the expense of a slower interrupt response time.
Most people don't need that. In fact, most people could probably do
perfectly well with just soft realtime, and to a lot of those people "hard
realtime" is just a marketing term.
It all tends to boil down to a device driver in the end, and the amount of
support you're willing to give it. Soft realtime can handle the rest.
Personally, I'm _not_ interested in making device drivers look like
user-level. They aren't, they shouldn't be, and microkernels are just
stupid.

You know what? I don't care. If the RTAI people are trying to make it easy
for non-GPL module people, I have absolutely zero interest.
In contrast, I _am_ interested if the kernel module is required to be (a)
small, (b) clear (c) GPL. You seem to not care about any of the three
things _I_ care about.
That's ok. The GPL means that you don't have to agree with me.

That's simply not true.
In user space, you'll never get the kinds of low overheads for the _true_
hard realtime, and to me that just says that what you're talking about is
really mostly just a slightly hardened soft-realtime.
