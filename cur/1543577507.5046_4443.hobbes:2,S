Subject: Looking for maintainer of ENSONIQ SoundScape driver

Hi,
I have an ENSONIQ SoundScape PNP sound card, and I am noticing
problems with it under linux-2.4.0-prerelease and linux-2.4.0. I have
created 2 diffs which solve the most pressing problem (and sort a few
messages out), but the driver seems to have deeper issues which I
would like to discuss with its maintainer, please. For instance,
although /dev/mixer does not use sscape.o (the mixer driver is in the
ad1848.o module), unloading sscape.o while a mixer application is
running causes a kernel oops when the application exits. The way that
sscape.o allocates IO ports is also suspicious, and causes these
messages to be logged every time the sound modules are loaded:
Jan 5 14:08:31 wittsend kernel: Trying to free nonexistent resource <00000338-00000339>
Jan 5 14:08:31 wittsend kernel: Trying to free nonexistent resource <00000330-00000337>
There is no specific person mentioned in the MAINTAINERS file for this
ISA PNP card, and I have received no response from the linux-sound
mailing list.
Is there anybody out there? 
Cheers,
Chris
