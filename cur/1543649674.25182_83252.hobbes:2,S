Hi,
Where can I get the latest kernel patch for BCM5700 ethernet adapter?
I have the BCM5700-2.2.8 patch for kernel 2.4.18 but I couldn't find one for
2.4.19 nor for the latest prereleases of 2.4.20.
What is the migration status of the driver to the standart kernel
tree?
Thanks in advance.
                               Doruk
