Is anyone using an ICP Vortex RAID controller with a 2.2.5 kernel?
I'm getting a completely hung machine after inserting the gdth.o module.
It prints out the first line:
Configuring GDT-PCI HA at 0/16 IRQ 11
and the *boom*, the machine locks up solid.
I checked ICP's site for any driver updates, but the one they have is the
same code that's in the 2.2.5 kernel. This card works great with the same
driver (or at least it reports the same version) under 2.0.36.
Any ideas?
