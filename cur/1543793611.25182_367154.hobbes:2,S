I agree. The PMU between, let's a P4, and IA-64 is totally
different. It does not make sense to try and emulate the P4
PMU on an Ia-64 system. Similarly, it  does not make sense
to develop a monitoring tool for IA-64 compiled in X86 mode
and relying on the emulation layer. 
The only thing we need to ensure is that those system calls
don't do anything, i.e., if ever invoked in IA-32 HW emulation
they would need to go to sys_ni().
