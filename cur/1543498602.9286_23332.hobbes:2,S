LOL... That's pretty funny!!!  :)
I always make sure that my front panel LEDs are connected properly before
I close the box I'm working on... :-)
I tried that program that people have mentioned from freshmet.  Good idea,
when they get it working, let me know... it segfaults every time it's run.
=/  Gr.
I just love software that does that.
Anyway... I like the idea of what the one guy said about having a shitload
of lights on the parallel port -- problem is that I don't have a free one.
In fact, I don't have ANY free ports on my system.
Hm.  Nor do I have free IRQs.
Well, it's time for a new computer when I get money anyway.
