Yes, it has been pretty chaotic.  Here's what I currently have:
exec-allow-init-to-exec-from-any-thread.patch
remove-dead-kill_sl-prototype-from-schedh.patch
do_tty_hangup-use-group_send_sig_info-not.patch
do_sak-dont-depend-on-session-id-0.patch
pidhash-dont-count-idle-threads.patch
pidhash-dont-use-zero-pids.patch
dont-touch-current-tasks-in-de_thread.patch
Plus a couple more patches from Oleg in the todo-queue: "choose_new_parent:
remove unused arg, sanitize exit_state check" and "simplify exec from
init's subthread", which we can assume I'll merge up.
