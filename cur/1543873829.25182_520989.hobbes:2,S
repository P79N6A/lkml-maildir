Oh, wait a minute.. that's not the correct IRQ, is it?
Your ueagle-atm must be on this one:
 20:   90833792    3057782   IO-APIC-fasteoi   ohci_hcd:usb1
In which case, it's not likely to be an interrupt sharing issue.
Can you confirm this?
Also, try moving your ueagle-atm to one of the ehci usb ports
and see how that affects things.
