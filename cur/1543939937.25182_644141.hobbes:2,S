I think there's a pretty big chance I'm wrong (or misunderstanding
something) here, so I'll just ask:
setup_object() from mm/slub.c is what calls the ctor. Shouldn't this
be called from slab_alloc() as well? (I'm marking the data
"uninitialized" there before returning the object.) Otherwise you
might get back an object that is initialized with the previous owner's
data. Or is this intentional?
Thanks.
