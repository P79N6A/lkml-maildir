I am using a single NTFS partition.
Note: I reversed-engineered the Windows FAT bootstrap code.  My analysis
is contained in the file doc/FAT in the Parted source distribution.  I
concluded that Windows uses LBA if the LBA flag is set in the boot
partition table entry.  (i.e. the partition type includes LBA in the
fdisk codes - this corresponds to a bit being set)

I just set the first 2 of these fields to 0, and everything still works.
Am I blessed?  (Or perhaps cursed!)
Isn't hidden_sectors an LBA value (and hence irrelevant to this discussion)?
Cheers,
