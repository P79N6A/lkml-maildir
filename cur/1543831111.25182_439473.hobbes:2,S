I'm pretty sure it doesn't. You can see it by watching 
the frequency of the perfctr mode NMI watchdog in /proc/interrupts 
under different loads.
When the system is idle the frequency goes down and increases
when the system is busy. I also got confirmation of this behaviour
from both Intel and AMD. C states > 0 are not supposed to run
the performance counters.
Are you sure you didn't boot with poll=idle? Otherwise something must
be wrong with your measurements.
