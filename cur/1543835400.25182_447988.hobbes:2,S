The point in the current option is to select or not select it - 
if the user gets it wrong it won't compile or worse miscompile.
Once it is auto selected the user could be still informed about 
it, but it doesn't matter much anymore (we don't inform the user
about every possible trade off based on compiler version everywhere)
