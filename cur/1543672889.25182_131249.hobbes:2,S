What's your setup ? Are you in SMP ? I was hit by a lock bug introduced near
6.2.30, which Justin fixed recently and included in his latest driver
(20030502). Justin suggested to me to try the NMI watchdog to find what was
wrong and it pointed us to a spinlock problem. Have you tried to debug
something ? I must say that this driver seems really robust now on my setup
(dual athlon), but perhaps your problem is of the same order and could be fixed
easily with some help, which would be good for you and everyone else.
Regards,
Willy
