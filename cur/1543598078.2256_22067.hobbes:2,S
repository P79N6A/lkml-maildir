That's what I said, and the comments match the code.

Memory needs to be written (with anything). It must be written before
it's used so that there are no "almost" logic levels within the cells.
The parasitic currents from having some cells "just barely on" will
totally screw up data retention in other cells. If anybody ever
writes memory initialization software that doesn't perform this
extremely important step, they just don't know what the hell they are
doing and will contribute towards a poor reputation for software
engineering.

Well I wrote the code. And I have written SDRAM initialization code
for many chip-sets.

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.1 on an i686 machine (799.53 BogoMips).
    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
