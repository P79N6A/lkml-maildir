  I, too, am (was?) a member of that list. I believe it has died because
SMP is mainline now, instead of cutting edge. Discussion is probably
appropriate here more than anywhere else.

  There is at least one significant difference between MP and MPX
chipsets, or at least there appears to be one from board specs. Both seem
to work if you can get part the BIOS, but one is faster, or cheaper, or
supports more memory. I did an eval of boards the other day and noted that
there was an issue, but the paperwork is not here.

  You put two CPUs in it (duh). Note that not all XP processors are SMP
enabled, you need to do hardware hacking on the new ones, which is fine if
you like hacking but hardly worth risking a chip just to save a few bucks.

  A non-SMP module can crash an SMP kernel at any time, the where and how
seem irrelevant. Why would you do that?

AFAIK, not. Don't really see the need. Let us know if you find a list with
useful content, however.
