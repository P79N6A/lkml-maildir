---------------------------
I'm running 2.4.22 now and have a NAT behind my firewall as well as IPv6
happily run through unixcore.com.  I upgraded to 2.4.22-bk2 last night
to fix an odd problem where I can't ssh-6 to one host.  All of a sudden
it all works within the nat but nothing behind the firewall can get out
from behind to the real work though the firewall still can.  Recompiled
trying 2.4.23-pre1 and I get the exact same behavior.  All 3 use the
same .config file.
The only noticable change I can see is a bunch of messages:
Aug 27 22:09:10 wally kernel: MASQUERADE: No route: Rusty's brain broke!
Aug 27 22:09:16 wally kernel: MASQUERADE: No route: Rusty's brain broke!
Aug 27 22:09:16 wally kernel: MASQUERADE: No route: Rusty's brain broke!
As soon as I reverted to 2.4.22 everything works great again.  Attaching
my .config.  Please contact me directly if you need any additional
testing done.
