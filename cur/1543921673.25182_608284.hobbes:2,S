Hum... did you test your patch with many routes declared ? (more than 32 on 
i386/x86_64)
127 is not a random value, but chosen as a power of two minus 1.
PAGE_SIZE is garanted to be a multiple of 128 (127 chars + line_feed) on all 
arches.
So each read() on /proc/net/route delivers PAGE_SIZE/128 lines.
With your patch, some lines might be truncated (one every 32 on i386)
