If we do take any type of daemon-oriented approach, then the daemon may,
in fact, want to know layout.  Certainly when we present this information
to the user, layout might be relevant (i.e. "USB disk device #5 failure,"
vs. "USB disk device on the 3rd port of the 1st hub has failed").  We need
access to the topological information.
Heck, I might want different behavior between the case where I unplug all
devices individually, or if I unplug a hub (and thus all it's associated
devices) instead.  Specifically, I'm thinking about laptops in this case,
where the user is using a single cable to a USB hub to attach a multitude
of devices at once.  Under these circumstances, USB Ethernet driver might
want to use a static IP... otherwise, we're probably at the office and
DHCP is the right answer.
