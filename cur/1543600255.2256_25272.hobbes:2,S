Subject: NFS to Irix server broken again in 2.4.9

Don't know if this is well-known already. The 2.4.9 kernel NFS client
does not see all files/directories mounted from an Irix 6.5 NFS server
(the 32/64-bit cookie problem). Changing NFS versions from 3 to 2 does
not help. 2.4.8 client works for me, but the problem is apparently
back in 2.4.9. I am running 2.4.9 with MOSIX 1.3.0 patches, but I do
not think that those are the cause of the problem.
