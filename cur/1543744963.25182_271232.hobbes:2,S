Already testing with RT-0.7.26-5 now. No good. Same lockup behavior on
alsa shutdown, altought not always, but very frequently. Nothing comes out
via serial console. Not even SysRq is of any help, pretty hard these
lockups are.
Oh, about the nmi_watchdog=1 trick: forget what I've told you before; I
already saw a couple of freezes while its on.
