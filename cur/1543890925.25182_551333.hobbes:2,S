It's not all that tricky. The ->fair_key computations are already
parametrized on load weights. The "task weights" here are just what
Linux calls "load weight," so we're largely done once task weights
are calculated.
The tricky part (if any) is essentially what you've already got nailed
down, that is, creating and manipulating the accounting objects for the
task groups or whatever you're calling them.
