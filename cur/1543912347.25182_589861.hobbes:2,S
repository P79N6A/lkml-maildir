It saves big chunks of code (not only initial register settings
arrays) and we'll extend it's use more inside ath5k_hw.c Trust me this
is a very useful step, eg. check out descriptor processing / setup or
PHY functions (calibrate/channel set etc). For example AR5210 mac chip
only comes with RF5110 phy chip so we can get rid of RF5111/RF5112
code, AR5211 comes with RF5111 so we can get rid of RF5110 and RF5112
code and AR5212 comes with RF5111 or RF5112 so we get rid of RF5110.
This thing also saves lots of checks during runtime (some of them
happen verry frequently, eg. durring descriptor processing). Also most
people will use 5212 code only, 5211 cards are on some old laptops and
5210, well i couldn't even find  a 5210 for actual testing :P
