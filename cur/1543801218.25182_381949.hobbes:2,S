First - the answer you provide is far from complete and it doesn't  
even touch the more important reasons why the kernel avoids doing  
FPU. (No, I don't feel obliged to explain the issue to you. Just a  
note: The reasons are just merely *technical* and not principal.)
Second - you still didn't explain why this allows you to conclude  
that sound mixing should in no way be done inside the kernel.
