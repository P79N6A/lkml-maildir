Subject: [PATCH 2.6] Fix mincore cornercases: overflow caused by large "len"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/25/392

This patch fixes 2 cornercases of overflow caused by argument len in
sys_mincore():
Case 1: len is so large that will overflow to 0 after page alignment.
E.g. len=(size_t)(-1), i.e. 0xff...ff.
Expected result: it's overflow and return ENOMEM.
Current result: len is aligned to 0, then treated the same as len=0 and
return succeed.
This cornercase has been fixed in do_mmap_pgoff(), and here
sys_mincore() also needs this fix.
Case 2: len is a large number but will not overflow after alignment. But
start+len will overflow.
E.g. len=(size_t)(-PAGE_SIZE), and start>0.
Expected result: it's overflow and return ENOMEM.
Current result: return EINVAL. Looks like considering len as a
non-positive value, probably influenced by manpage. But since the type
of len is size_t, i.e. unsigned, it shouldn't be considered as
non-positive value.
I've also reported this inconsistency to manpage mincore.
