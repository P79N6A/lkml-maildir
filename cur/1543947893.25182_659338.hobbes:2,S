ok, let's try something else: change the line "#if 0" to "#if 1" at the
beginning of kernel/params.c, it looks like:
#if 0
#define DEBUGP printk
#else
#define DEBUGP(fmt, a...)
#endif
rebuild your kernel, and reboot with it. Then, please send me that boot log to
see whether the kernel command line is being received from the boot loader and
what exactly is getting parsed. Thanks.

Please see whether you can apply the patch Bart just sent and if that still gets
mangled and cannot be applied, consider making those changes to ide-cd.c by hand
- after all, there are only several lines that need to be changed so it won't
take that long.
Thanks.
