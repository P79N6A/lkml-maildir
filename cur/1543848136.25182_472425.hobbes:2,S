Obviously because someone out-side of C might want to interact with
the data protected by A or B.
But wait... what are the implications of that.
The data managed by B (where B == cpu_chain.rwsem) is a list of 
notifiers.  Each notifier is called with CPU_DOWN_PREPARE and then
will be called with either CPU_DOWN_FAILED or CPU_DEAD.
Now because we release and reclaim B it is possible for someone to add
or remove a notifier.  Either of these event means that the relevant
notifier will get called with one of these but not the other.  It
seems likely that a notifier will be written to assume this
bracketing.
In fact workqueue_cpu_callback (which is such a notifier) does
		mutex_lock(&workqueue_mutex);
in CPU_DOWN_PREPARE and 
		mutex_unlock(&workqueue_mutex);
in CPU_DOWN_FAILED and CPU_DEAD.
If it got registered in the middle of _cpu_down, then it would unlock
a mutex that wasn't locked.  Now I suspect it cannot be registered
while _cpu_down is active as it is only registered once, very early.
But it certainly does raise the question of why all this locking
is needed....
I think I'm in favour of the following.  It should clean up the
lockdep warning and seems to make sense.
