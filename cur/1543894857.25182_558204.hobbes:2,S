it is _you_ forgetting to read what you wrote just 1 mail ago above. 
_Read_ it:
  "The legal terms provide an indication of the intent, but the 
   preamble, along with the free software definition it alludes to, do 
   an even better job at that.".
Your point was totally bogus, and you have been pointed out that your 
point was bogus. And your answer - instead of admitting that you were 
wrong once again (i'm not even asking you to apologize for wasting our 
time) - to pretend that there is "no disagreement" and to patronize your 
discussion partner with a "you keep forgetting ..." phrase and a 
non-sequitor statement? How low can this discussion get? I'm truly 
amazed ...
