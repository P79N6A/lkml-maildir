There are tools for setting and clearing at
ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/kernel-2.3/
I also mirror that at my place below and have some extensions to it.
securebits has nothing to change it in the kernel AFAIK. In my patches I
add a new securebit and let you config at compile time the securebits.
I was going to make the securebits a per task thing but I chickened out of
that.

Any caps I mention are *derived* from a withdrawn draft posix document.
