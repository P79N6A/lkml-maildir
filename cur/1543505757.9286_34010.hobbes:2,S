If I follow correctly, then:
  readl/writel swaps on bigendian, not on littleendian
  bigendian_readl/writel swaps on littlendian, not no bigendian ?
The only cases I have insight into are PCI drivers, where the swapping
points on bigendian machines can be:
- none, all device registers are little-endian
- on the motherboard, flip all memread32/memwrite32 but no DMA access
  (the hardware folks at work believe this exists somewhere, but I haven't
  seen it)
- on the motherboard, selectable on a page-by-page basis (ultrasparc?)
- on the card - one or more areas can be configured to flip byte order
  to big-endian
I'm assuming that there are no PCI devices where device registers are
always big-endian.  (is that true for all weird Mac cards?)  Handling of
cases is:
1. The driver knows the hardware is little-endian, and always uses 
   readl/writel.
2. Kernel/arch knows the hardware, and defines readl/writel, etc. properly.
   (i.e. no software swap in readl) The driver works like (1).
3,4. The driver sets the swapping inside an #ifdef BIGENDIAN when first
   setting up the hardware, and then uses native_readl/native_writel.
(Note that if the card does the swapping, it doesn't have to be a separate
memory region - it might just be a config bit that flips one or more
of the existing regions.)
However, there's probably a case for bigendian_readl/writel as well, 
so that S-Bus drivers (S-Bus is native bigendian, I assume? I'm overly
ignorant of it) can co-exist with PCI drivers without any conditional
logic inside of the readl/writel functions.  Like the other cases, the
driver knows the endianness of the hardware, and just uses the right
function without any #if BIGENDIAN messiness.
Does this make sense?
