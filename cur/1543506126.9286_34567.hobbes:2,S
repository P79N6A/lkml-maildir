Yes, I've played with a version of this beta.
It's really cool, that I can finally get information about system board
PnP devices that are totally hidden from Linux, until you get them
enabled.  (ie, the SMC IrCC is built into the SuperChip controller, and
isapnp never saw it..)
I really hope this gets into the Linux kernel, for it makes the IrDA FIR
devices easier to find and configure.
