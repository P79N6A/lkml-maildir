Sorry for the F'up, but this turned to be slightly untrue: turning off SACK
makes the syn handshake happen, but some packets further down the stream
the masquerading router sends a RST again.

I forgot to mention that the kernels that don't work are for amd64. In
the meantime, I also tried out 2.6.11 (as I had some troubles with
2.6.12..2.6.13-rc7 on other amd64 machines), with the same result (reply
packets are ignored/rejected).
