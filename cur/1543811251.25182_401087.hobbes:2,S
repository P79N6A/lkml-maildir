hi, I think it is a good idea but there has been quite a long discusion of 
this issue on the reiserfs-list (some of it also on lkml) in the last few 
years, with the latest posts in May 2005 I think, most of ithem with the 
"file as directory" subject . The idea was if you have e.g. a "book" 
directory/file (object) and chapters within it, then the default action of 
"book" object when read as a file would be to give a concatenation of the 
chapter objects within it. There should be ways of specifying non-default 
actions for the objects too. There has also been a lot a resistance here to 
this idea, as it is quite a radical change to the concept of the conventional 
unstructured, serial "file". (I don't believe these are good reason not to 
try the idea at least.)
Read those mails first. Peter
