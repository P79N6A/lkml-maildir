I don't think this is a good idea.  The current behaviour should work
across the board.  Diskless nodes should use a diskless bootloader
which support command lines -- that way you get to specify the mode as
well.  *ALL* nodes should use the command line these days.
Can we get rid of the g----d bootsect.S, please?
