Removed, thanks.

Yes, you're right (not really sure what I was thinking there ;-)

Sure, sign extension should get shifted back off, but that is more
accurate.

I agree.  Here's the respin.

Subject: [PATCH take2] Use ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK if poll() is interrupted by a signal
From: Chris Wright <chrisw@sous-sol.org>
Lomesh reported poll returning EINTR during suspend/resume cycle.
This is caused by the STOP/CONT cycle that the freezer uses, generating
a pending signal for what in effect is an ignored signal.  In general
poll is a little eager in returning EINTR, when it could try not bother
userspace and simply restart the syscall.  Both select and ppoll do use
ERESTARTNOHAND to restart the syscall.  Oleg points out that simply using
ERESTARTNOHAND will cause poll to restart with original timeout value.
which could ultimately lead to process never returning to userspace.
Instead use ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK, and restart poll with updated timeout
value.  Inspired by Manfred's use ERESTARTNOHAND in poll patch.
