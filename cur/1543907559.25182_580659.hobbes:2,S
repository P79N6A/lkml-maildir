Problem is I don't think we can do this. As far as I can tell, on my 
Compaq at least, it's not being done through ACPI AML in the DSDT, like 
in the _PTS function (which the kernel executes and can snoop), but when 
we actually do the power-off we write a value to a magic ACPI register. 
That likely triggers the BIOS to take control in SMM mode and access the 
controller directly before triggering the power off, which we have no 
control or knowledge of.
