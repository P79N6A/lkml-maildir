On a swapless box you are unlikely to ever achieve 65% used by anonymous
pages in real world applications. Its suprising how much of memory is
file backed when you actually try it out. One exception in the future
might be a system with extensive amounts of XIP, where very little of
the binaries is actually pulled into RAM and thus counted into the
figures.
