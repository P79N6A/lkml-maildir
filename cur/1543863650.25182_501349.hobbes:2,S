Why is the initial user namespace being treated specially here?
Especially when you start considering nested containers special treatment
like this is semantically a real problem, to maintain.
If we need to I can see doing something special if the process setting
fown has CAP_KILL and bypassing the security checks that way, but
hard coding rules like that when it doesn't appear we have any
experience to indicate we need the extra functionality looks
premature.
