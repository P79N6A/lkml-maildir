Not quite, the boards are very different.

UP2000 is based on Tsunami (Same as the Compaq DS20, DS10 and the DP264
machines), this will not run with a K7. The UP1000 is indeed based on
Irongate (the AMD chipset) so in theory, the board could run either,
though you'd still have the BIOS issue to deal with.

They are not Digital/Compaq product. They are from Alpha Processor Inc.
(www.alpha-processor.com).
