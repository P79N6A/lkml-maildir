The question is not if git is efficient enough to handle workflow C, but 
if that worflow is efficient enough to help anybody.
Guess what takes me the longest time when committing?  The commit message.  
But it is really helpful, so there is a _point_ in writing one, and there 
is a _point_ in committing when I do it: it is a point in time where I 
expect the tree to be in a good shape, to be compilable, and to solve a 
specific problem which I describe in the commit message.
So I absolutely hate this "transparency".  Git _is_ transparent; it does 
not affect any of my other tools; they still work very well 
thankyouverymuch.
What your version of "transparency" would do: destroy bisectability, make 
an absolute gibberish of the history, and more!
Nobody could read the output of "git log" and form an understanding what 
was done.  Nobody could read the commit message for a certain "git blame"d 
line that she tries to make sense of.
IOW you would revert the whole meaning of the term Source Code Management.
Hth,
