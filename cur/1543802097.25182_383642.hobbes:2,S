This is why I try to follow the top of tree as closely as possible.
While parts of ACPI are well contained, other parts get stomped on constantly.
My two updates in 10 hours were not becaudse of what I did,
it was in response to seeing the flood gates in 2.6.16 open.
Also, it isn't accurate that nothing changed at my end.
I put some trivial patches into my release branch,
udpated the release branch with upstream,
and then pulled the release branch into my test branch
where there are other patches you haven't seen yet.
I pushed the release branch just to 'clear the deck' of
the trivial patches there since there was no reason to delay
them behind all the stuff still on the test branch.

In the past I have use git-cherry-pick to recover from when a "good" patch
was checked in on top of a "bad" patch, and I wanted to push
the good without the bad.
But the linearization model will not work for me in general.
Branches enable parallel lines of development in git.  If that
is thrown out, then we're basically back at quilt.
