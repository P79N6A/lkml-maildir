Possibly, yes.  Estimates based on unknown numbers are hard, though.

I don't know.  If things get bad enough that you experience
uncorrectable errors, I'd just trash the stick and get a new one
instead.  Trouble is - with a controller chip doing the error
correction, you have no means of knowing when this happens.

Writing everything once a week is harmless.  Filling the whole device is
best-case behaviour.  Local hot spots are the problem.
