That may be too much of a good thing, but perhaps we can go to quiet=N 
or bootmsglvl=N or some such to let people tune the output. I personally 
like having the verbose output, but my systems tend to be stable enough 
that I don't see it often other than benchmarking, etc.
While throwing out ideas, bootmsgmask=#dddd would let people control 
various parts of the output individually. That may be overkill, but it 
is flexible overkill. And the default could be what we have now, with 
the option of even more babble for debugging. Developers might find that 
highly useful if they had a way to let users selectively enable more 
info at boot time.
