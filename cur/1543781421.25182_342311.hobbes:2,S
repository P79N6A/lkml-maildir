For the moment my weekends are more or less "free time to hack". My thesis is 
some hardware design, I don't have the tools at home so there is little I can 
do at the weekend. This will change in september I think, then I will TeX all 
day ;)

Testing will very likely include crashing the machine more than once and doing 
some nasty things with the attached storage. Someone will have to plug the 
wire out of it while accessing the storage, reboot the switch and such stuff. 
This can really hurt in a production environment.

I'm sure it is.

Before you throw it away send it to me ;) I like to have some obscure hardware 
around.

I think the main stuff could be done in a week or two. My problem is that I 
can't test it on my own (and it's likely to do some bad things with data 
behind it) and that I would like to have someone experienced to review what I 
do. I'll keep sending this stuff to linux-scsi, but I have no reaction from 
anyone there. I hope they will wake up when the interesting stuff comes ;)
