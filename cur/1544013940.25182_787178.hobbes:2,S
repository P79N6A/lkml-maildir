Are you thinking of sync? If so I have experience of this not helping 
with ext3 on an 8Gbyte SD card in an EeePC 900. Sooner or later a bunch 
of zeros overwrites the early part of the partition and an fsck tears 
the FS apart. This seems to happen quickly if you are booting your root 
from the SD card (no swap though). A FAT32 partition seems to be 
unperturbed so far (but it's not being used the same way as the ext3 
partition).

I have never had premature ejection of SD with my Eee...
