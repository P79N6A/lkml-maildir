No, it's legitimate (and can happen in other scenarios).

Details, please...  All filesystems I'm familiar with won't (AFAICS) have
any problems with that.  What exactly do you have in mind?  Note that
in a lot of areas you get GFP_NOFS allocations anyway - that's the primary
defense against deadlocks and it's almost always enough.  The only trouble
I can recall more or less recently was hpfs - there we had (among shitpiles
of other races) several places that required explicit GFP_NOFS.  Usually
it just works...
