not mch sadly. I tried booting into it once more and had to wait quite a
while (around 30minutes) until the lock. I got this around 10 minutes before
the lock though:
Nov 15 00:09:23 mango kernel: bug in rtc_read(): called in state S_IDLE!
The system locked up quitly again. no console dump. sys rq kept working (i
could sync, remount ro and reboot). Does sys rq offer diagnosis which would
be useful for you?
