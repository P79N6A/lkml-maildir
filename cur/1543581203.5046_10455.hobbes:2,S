You do not need to do that. Enable both SMP and APM (just APM support, no
ACPI nor any other apm option). And add to your lilo.conf file a line:
append="apm=power-off".
At boot you will see a log message like:
apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x03 (Driver version 1.14)
apm: disabled - APM is not SMP safe (power off active).
So kernel diables APM but lets the power-off feature active.
