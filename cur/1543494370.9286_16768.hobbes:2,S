I know the feeling, I've done it myself often enough...

I have to admit that I don't know, as it's not something I've ever
tried to do.

Well, the resolution is a standard one, and the rest of it is easy
enough to do - if you only select one resolution/colourdepth
combination in Xconfigurator then only that one resolution/colourdepth
combination can ever be selected. I run my base system at
1024x768x24-bit doing just that, since it's the only resolution I ever
need to use...
Best wishes from Riley.
