Putting it back doesn't alter the outcome - hanging. And the original 
patch, (hope it was the right one) from:

has been tried with the following variations. With and without 
optimizing for size, with and without preempt, with and without kernel 
boot params (cfq, lapic), cold and hot starts, and then I threw in a smp 
compile for measure. All have the same behaviour:
[...]
Checking 'hlt' instruction... OK.
[10 minutes wait. Then a long callback trace
 scrolls off the screen ending like Thomas']
<0>Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
My toolchain (well, the whole software system) is quite contemporary 
within the stable branches. Built from scratch with gcc-3.4.3, glibc-
20041011 (nptl) and binutils-2.15.92.0.2
No energy control, acpi-pm or whatever it's called, is used here. The 
machine is extremely stable. Running with 100 percent utilization 24/7.
Don't shoot the messenger ;)
