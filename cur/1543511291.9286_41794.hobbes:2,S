Subject: [patch] wait4 SMP race fix (2.2.* && 2.3.*)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In wait4(2) there's an SMP race that may lead to an userspace deadlock
where the parent miss a wakeup from the child and so then the parent hangs
forever in wait4().
The problem can happen only if the parent masked SIGCHLD before calling
wait4() (exactly as bash does) so there won't be any signal pending and
the wakeup of the parent will be done only through the chldexit wq.
	CPU0				CPU1
	----				----
	fork()
					reschedule the child
	block SIGCHLD
	wait4()
					do_exit()
	add to wait_chldexit wq
	check all chids
	all chids are running so
	enter the sleep/wait path
					task->state = TASK_ZOMBIE;
					wakeup chldexit wq
	task->state = INTERRUPTIBLE;
	/* we invalidated the wakeup!! */
	schedule()
	deadlock
Here it is the fix against 2.2.13pre14:

I have not the confirm my above patch fixes the deadlock but I am quite
optimistic it will 8).
The patch goes fine on the top of 2.3.18*.
