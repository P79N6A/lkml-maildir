But the swap being touched bothers me.  Although I've had problems with
leaving Mozilla up for long times and it leaking. Without Mozilla running
and running lots of other apps, I have almost 100% memory used, but 0%
swap.
If the swap starts to increase slowly over time, you _do_ have a
leak somewhere.  Probably not in the kernel (kernel memory never goes into
swap). But if you want to see if the kernel is leaking, examine
/proc/slabinfo once in a while and if you see something there constantly
growing, then that might indicate a leak.  Just pay attention to the first
column.
