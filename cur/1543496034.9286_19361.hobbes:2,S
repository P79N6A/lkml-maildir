Hell knows. I can see one thing where it would be a clear win - if we are
deep down on free blocks we will be better off taking them from the queue
instead of searching through bitmaps. This would require a bit different
eater on the blocks queue (different behaviour when fs is low on free
space; instead of marking blocks free put them into the small cache
where they can be found fast; finding free block would involve checking
the cache if we are low on free blocks).
