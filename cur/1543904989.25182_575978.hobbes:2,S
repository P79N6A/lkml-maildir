Apologies, missed the patch before.
With the patch applied the Dreamcast no longer crashes or locks with
either 16, 24 or 32 bpp, so that's good.
With 24bpp everything is doubled up (eg two boot logos on screen) and
about twice (?) the size it should be - though with a black screen.
With 32 bpp everything is about 4 (?) times the size it should be and
all on a yellow background.
With 16bpp then everything is on a blue background as before, but is
also the correct size (as before).
So, it's better certainly, but there are still a few issues with the
driver, though nothing that takes down the box.
So thanks!
Adrian
