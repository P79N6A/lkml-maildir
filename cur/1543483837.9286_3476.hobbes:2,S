Guys, this topic has been covered a dozen times before.  It's in the FAQ. If
the original poster had bothered to read the FAQ, it wouldn't even have come
up again. Bottom line: Linus is *not* going to do this for you.  If you
implement it, he's not going to use it, so someone else is going to have to
maintain it, building off of his releases.  If you want to do it yourself as a
service to others, excellent.  Implement it, and let everyone know.  But
debating what "we" want to do is pointless because Linus himself isn't going
to go for it, so if you don't have any intention of actually going through
the motions yourself, this thread should die.
