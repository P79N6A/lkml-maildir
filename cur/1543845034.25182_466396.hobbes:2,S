There is now an ongoing discussion about that here:
http://uwsg.ucs.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0609.2/2151.html
continues here:
http://uwsg.ucs.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0609.3/0008.html
with many posts already.
I'd like you to contribute to it.
In particular, I would be very happy if you (or anyone
else) will tell me why the noexec filesystem deny PROT_EXEC
for MAP_PRIVATE, while even the R/O filesystem doesn't deny
PROT_WRITE for MAP_PRIVATE? This is one of the key points of
mine, but there are others too.
