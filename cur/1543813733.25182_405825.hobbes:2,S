i have released the 2.6.16-rc6-rt1 tree, which can be downloaded from 
the usual place:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
again, lots of changes all over the map:
- firstly, the -rt tree has been rebased to 2.6.16-rc6, which was a more
  complex operation than usual, due to the many changes in 2.6.16 (in 
  particular the mutex code).
- the PI code got reworked again, this time by Thomas Gleixner. The
  priority boosting chain is now instantaneous again (and not 
  wakeup/scheduling based) - but the previous list-walking hell has been 
  avoided via the clever use of plists. Plus many other changes and
  lots of cleanups to the rt-mutex proper.
- the rt-SLAB code got reworked too - hopefully for the better.
- there's also a completely new PI-futex approach included, ontop of the
  robust-list futex feature. All combinations of PI and robustness are
  supported: default non-robust non-PI futexes, robust+PI, !robust+PI,
  PI+!robust futexes.
- new latency tracer feature: print every function call done by the
  kernel to the console - useful to debug early bootup hangs or other
  nasty bugs.
- plus zillions of bugfixes (and no doubt new regressions).
to build a 2.6.16-rc6-rt1 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.15.tar.bz2
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.16-rc6.bz2
