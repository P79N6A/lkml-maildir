sk->sleep cannot change while you are inside wait_for_tcp_memory,
so that it is not essential.

It is not safe to modify it at all. Particularly, in your case
locking socket is non-sense, because socket is accessed only
by your process and irq events are not serialized wrt. socket lock
in any case. So that, the lock does not make any useful work.
But you are right in large. Probably the crashes, which you observe
are really related to missing sk->sleep locking.
Try 
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/smp-<whatever>
 (with corresponding modifications
to your code) to check this.
