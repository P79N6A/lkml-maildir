Xen requires slighly modified kernels, while e.g.
Linux-VServer only uses a _single_ kernel for all
virtualized guests ...

well, that largely depends on the 'use' ...
I don't think that vps providers like lycos would be
very happy if they had to multiply the ammount of
machines they require by 10 or 20 :)
and yes, running 100 and more Linux-VServers on a
single machine _is_ realistic ...
