yes, its a great help

Hey, no need to excuses, its there, test and use it, using old protocols
is not something to be ashamed, neither hacking it... 8)

you can try, but the codebase there (and I assume you're talking about
the LLC stack in the 2.4-ac tree, as the one in the 2.4 stock is
incomplete) is old and I'm only now getting to a point where LLC in
2.5 is getting pretty stable (now as in today, 4am :) )

Could you try with the next version Linus releases? I some fixes already
commited into Linus bk tree, some still in DaveM's tree and some waiting
for DaveM to pull that, I think, will solve your problem, and wow, don't
give up, at least I'd have one more person testing my work 8)
Just let me know if you'd like to get a diff from the latest Linus
released kernel to the latest stuff I have, I'll be glad to provide and
to receive test results.
Best Regards,
