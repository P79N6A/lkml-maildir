Why?  Writes from CPU1 don't have to be seen in the same order on CPU2.
Compiler has every right to turn that into
	load from smack_known
	store to ->smk_next
	...
	store to smack_known
and there's no reason whatsoever why these two stores won't be seen
out of order on CPU2 - there's no barrier and all we have is a bunch
of assignments from registers to various (nonrepeating) addresses in
memory.  On out-of-order architectures they can be reordered just fine
by CPU itself...
You need at least a barrier, assuming that you want to keep that kind
of lockless access in readers (actually, I wonder if that list is a
good choice of data structure here - you are using it as a symbol table
and depending on the expected use pattern there might be better choices
for that).
