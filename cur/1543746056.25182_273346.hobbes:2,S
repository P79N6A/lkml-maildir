DEAR SIR,
I AM KENNETH BELLO WORKING WITH TRIMARK BANK PLC IN ABIDJAN COTE D
IVOIRE. I WANT TO TRANSFER TO YOUR ACCOUNT THE SUM OF USD2.5 MILLION
 SO WE CAN SHARE THE FUND UNTO THE RATIO OF

THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED SINCE YOU HAVE THE SAME LAST NAME WITH
HIM.
I HAVE ALL THE DOCUMENTRY EVIDENCE TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE
FUND WITH OUR BANK AS EVERY THING WILL BE EXECUTED UNDER A
LEGITIMATE ARRANGEMENT TO PROTECT YOUR INTREST.
SEND ME YOUR CONTACT PHONE AND FAX SO I WILL GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.
MR KENNETH BELLO
