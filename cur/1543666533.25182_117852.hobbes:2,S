No, readb() and friends are not defined on machines that don't have PCI. None
of the MMIO wd33c93 drivers are PCI.
However, it's fine for me to use in_8(addr) and out_8(addr,b) (cfr.
include/asm-m68k/raw_io.h) inside #if defined(__mc68000__) ||
defined(CONFIG_APUS).
On MIPS, it looks like you can use readb() and writeb(), since MIPS is less
picky than m68k about not defining PCI access primitives on machines without
PCI.
