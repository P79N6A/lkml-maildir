I have Toshiba M55 325 Laptop, which have Marvell 10/100 Base-TX
Ethernet card. I think the driver for this is sk98lin.ko, I am also
successful in loading that (saw lsmod). After loading when I do 'ls
/proc/net/sk98lin/' , it does not show me anything.
I am not able to understand how can I access the network card, what
device file I need to use for that ? When I do ifconfig, it only shows
me the loopback interface.
Looking for any healp on this.
regards,
