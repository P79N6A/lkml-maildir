Just tried this on a dual PPro:
% cat > try.c
void main ()
{
    * (unsigned int *) 0 = 0;
}
% cc -o try try.c
% ./try
Segmentation fault
% ldd core
% dmesg | tail -1
perfmon: v0.4 (19990127) Richard Gooch (rgooch@atnf.csiro.au), 2 counters
Nope, doesn't cause a reboot, panic, Oops or any problems
here. Running as root makes no difference.
