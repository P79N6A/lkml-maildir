	Does it work non over-clocked?  If yes, then those CPUs can't
handle 450mhz.  This is not unusual.  Oh, and BTW: 300->450 is NOT
'slight' in overclocking.  Also, the tempature doesn't neccessairly
mean diddly-sqwat when overclocking, in fact, in this case it sounds
likely that the problem is not enough voltage, but if you increase
the voltage, you increase the heat..
	In any case, since you're over-clocking your oops means
nothing.
