Ok.  Glad I didn't try it. ;)

I don't understand why samba is doing it, if infact it is.
(haven't checked the source yet, and too tired to care atm)
Two other people told me to try your 2.4.0 tree, as it has some FAT

guessing (hoping) that -ac3 will fix this problem.
Thanks alot for your help.
David.
