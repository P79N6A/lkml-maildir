Subject: Unable to reread SCSI optical disks

I have an old MaxOptix optical drive that has been used for years
to back up the weekly data on a SCO Unix machine. Now the machine
has been upgraded with new hardware and Redhat Linux, I would
still like to be read in all the old data.
The optical drive is connected to an Adaptec 1540 SCSI controller
and the driver is compiled as a module. Once the module is
loaded, it finds the drive and the disk and tells me the partition
of where the data is stored. I can then mount and access the
data on the sysv filesystem.
My problem comes when I unmount the disk, eject it and insert a
different disk. It appears to mount ok but when I look at the
data it has the directory structure that was on the old disk
and I am unable to read anything. Is there some reason why
it did not reread the directory structure?
Here is some relevant information and copy of the log entries:
Single Intel Pentium III-450 on a Dual board (MicroStar)
Onboard SCSI controller (Adaptec AIC-7895) for hard disk
Offboard ISA SCSI controller (Adaptec 1540) for optical
MaxOptix T3-1301 Optical drive
RedHat Linux 5.2 base
Kernels tried with no difference (2.0.36, 2.2.12, 2.2.14)
This is a main server so development kernels are not recommended.
