The SDIO spec doesn't really allow such a card to exist. So it's not surprising that things break. Does any stack support this odd-ball card?

I think it's a bit more complex than that. There are likely locks all over the place, both in the relevant driver and the driver model core, that makes this very difficult. Not to mention the fact that the correct timeout will be finite, and you never know how long it will take you to load the firmware.
A better approach is to simply have the drivers for your subfunctions synchronize things. Make sure noone calls sdio_enable_func() until the firmware has been loaded. This could even be done from user space in case you want to use a standard driver.
