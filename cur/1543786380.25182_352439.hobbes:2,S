Ok, but how do you verify that the mm->hiwater_* counters are correct to
any degree? because it appears that at least hiwater_vm is incorrect in
post-2.6.11 and not by a small amount.
What about calling
static inline void grow_total_vm(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long increase)
{
	mm->total_vm += increase;
	if (mm->total_vm > mm->hiwater_vm)
		mm->hiwater_vm = mm->total_vm;
}
whenever total_vm is increased and possibly doing something similar for rss at
different places? If it is not on the fast path then it's not necessary to
#ifdef the thing anywhere.
