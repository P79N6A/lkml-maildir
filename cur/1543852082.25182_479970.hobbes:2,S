Yes... What is painful is that moving from a configuration with modules
to a configuration without modules, this can change.

Nope, you don't. I'm now using a kernel without modules for what's disk 
related, and unless people (read kernel developpers) change something 
in the init order, I'm now with a stable environment, without udev or
initramfs.
