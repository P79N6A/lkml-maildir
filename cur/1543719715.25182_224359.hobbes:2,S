You are right. The specific problem I was trying to
fix is when no hardware is detected. I looked at other
PCI drivers (char/epca.c and net/eepro100.c) and which call
pci_unregister_driver if pci_register_driver returns <= 0
and indicates that pci_register_device returns the number
of pci devices detected. I now see that the two drivers I
looked at are broken. (bad luck that)
After looking at the source for pci_register_device(),
if no devices are detected, then it still returns 1.
I will rework the patches against synclink.c/synclinkmp.c
to only call pci_unregister_device() if init fails
(such as when no devices are detected)
*and* the call to pci_register_device() succeeds.
