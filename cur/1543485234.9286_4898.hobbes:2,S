The only thing that will bite people is that we now do partition tables
for MO to spec. Old fdisk and kernel did not. The latest util-linux
has fdisk -b 2048 options for handling this, and you basically want
to divide all the offset/counts by four for a Linux old style (ie wrong
according to win/dos) partition label on such media.
