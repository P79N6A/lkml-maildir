Mary,
How's this for a response to Andrew and lkml?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew,
After running several iterations of the database workload, it seems
the patch below did indeed eliminate the BUG() we were hitting.
In addition, the patched kernel seems to perform somwhat better.
The workload performance is improved by about 2%, and the standard
deviation in performance between iterations of the work load was reduced
from 137 to 48.
A performance results comparison can be found at
http://www.osdl.org/projects/dbt2dev/results/8way/70AKPM/results.html
Thanks to Mary Meredith  <maryedie@osdl.org> for the performance
measurements and comparisons, and for hitting the BUG() in the first place.
