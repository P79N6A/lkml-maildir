Or more likely the author knew that this_residual was going to be positive
in all cases anyway. Its just sloppy typing by the scsi layer.
The typing of min() is something I do agree with Linus about (for once 8)),
and making people think about them is a good idea. When DaveM proposed the
original his patches showed up a bug in the older ixj driver immediately.
