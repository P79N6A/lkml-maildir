First of all, thanks for your elaborate reply.
It cleared up a lot of things for me.
According to your patch the first accaptable version is 5 while the version
of thehost bridge op my Inspiron 8100 appears to be 4, so I'm definitely hit
by INTEL's saddening policy.  :-(
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 82815 815 Chipset Host Bridge and Memory Controller Hub (rev 04)
        Control: I/O- Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR+ FastB2B-

        Capabilities: [a0] AGP version 2.0

                Command: RQ=0 SBA+ AGP+ 64bit- FW- Rate=x1
But my current home-baked 2.4.18 kernel with a fairly old acpi-version
already appears to support the acpi P-state support you mention.
It seems to work. No throttling support though. I'm less than
thrilled by the power management support of this laptop and
the SpeedStep policy of INTEL. (yes, it's more of a (marketing) policy
than a technology, in my opinion)
