The 100MB/s is probably the PCI bus, yes. The theoretical limit of a
32bit,33MHz PCI bus is 33^6*32/8 = 132.000.000 = ~ 125MB/s. In practice,
there's always some overhead.
An ATA33 drive can't go over 33MB/s, as the bus don't deliver any more.
an ATA100 bus can give you 100MB/s, but there is currently no drive
available that can give you that. The fastest drive I've read about, is
the Western Digital WD1200BB (120 gig). They brag about pushing 525Mbit/s
from buffer to disk. That's some 65 megs per sec, which is pretty amazing.
