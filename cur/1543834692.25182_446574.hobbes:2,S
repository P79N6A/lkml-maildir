I just found that there is another problem with this machine - DMI :)
Both kernel and dmidecode says that the DMI is not present - so one would say 
that the BIOS does not support DMI.
But wait... HWiNFO32 for DOS shows working DMI 2.0 with real data (although 
some data is from Intel Trajan reference board, apparently not changed by 
BIOS engineer...)
Examining $F000 BIOS segment revealed that the "_DMI_" signature is not 
present. But there is "_DMI20_" - and the header does not seem to match. I 
can see all the strings (like "Trajan") there...
Anyone interested in BIOS dump?
