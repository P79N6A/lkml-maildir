Well Greg, the aim of the patch is to save memory when the kobject is not
in use. I don't think it is a good idea to buy the same thing in  
600 bytes of RAM which is available for just 100 bytes.
I trying one more version which should not put any or minimum load on kobject 
when it is not in sysfs.
