Yes, but that's not the type of devices this is for.

Oh, I agree, multiple drivers for the same functionality is not a nice
thing from a distro standpoint.
The work I'm doing here is for stupid PCI firmware engineers, who have
created devices that are different things, all bound up under the same
PCI device.  I'm thinking of watchdog timers and random number
generator and i2c controller on the same PCI device, or even the more
basic, frame buffer and DRM access to the same PCI video device.
The OLPC is a good example of hardware that needs this kind of
functionality.
In order to take advantage of the "multiple drivers per device" all
drivers need to guarantee to play nice with others, as they need to be
aware that other drivers will be sharing the hardware.
I'll write up more details later this week, if I get this stuff to work
properly :)
