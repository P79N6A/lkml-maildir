Are you sure it's really all that bad?
The machines I use are even slower (~6 bogomips), but system calls still
seem pretty fast; I've measured them as having about a total
65-instruction overhead on my arch -- which is a lot slower than a
function call to be sure, but presumably the actual work done by the
system call ends up being more.
