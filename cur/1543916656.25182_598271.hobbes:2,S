hm, dunno.  The only substantial patch which touches
arch/x86_64/kernel/process.c (which is where cpu_idle lives) is
x86_64-prep-idle-loop-for-dynticks.patch.
The problem is, 2.6.23-rc6-mm1's git-acpi patch had all the new cpuidle
code in it.  Len dropped all that code over the weekend (which is when I
picked this copy of his tree), so 2.6.23-rc7-mm1 doesn't have the cpuidle
code.  Len will be reapplying the cpuidle patches today(ish) so next -mm
_will_ have the cpuidle code.
So what we have in rc7-mm1 is this transient no-cpuidle state.  It could be
that the x86_64 dynticks code (which was developed previously tested in
conjunction with the cpuidle patches) has some dependency on cpuidle.
So it's all a bit of a mess :(
I think I'll basically stop applying things which don't look like bugfixes
for a while and try to get more -mm's out, as we seriously need to get this
lot stabilised asap.
Len, would it be possible to restore cpuidle sometime today please?
