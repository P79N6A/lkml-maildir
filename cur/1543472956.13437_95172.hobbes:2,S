Assuming two systems:
	system A eth0: 10.0.1.1 eth1: 192.168.1.254
	system B eth0: 10.0.2.1 eth1: 192.168.2.254
Where the network connections are via eth0 (the 10.0.0.0 network) and
the two systems wish to have the 192.168.1 and 192.168.2 networks
tunneled together:
On system A:
	ip tunnel add tun0 mode ipip remote 10.0.2.1 local 192.168.1.254
	ip addr add 192.168.1.254 dev tun0
	ip link set tun0 up
	ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 dev tun0                           
On system B:
	ip tunnel add tun0 mode ipip remote 10.0.1.1 local 192.168.2.254
	ip addr add 192.168.2.254 dev tun0
	ip link set tun0 up
	ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev tun0                           
Don't forget to poke holes in your firewall for protocol 4 (not port 4, 
protocol 4 for IPIP or protocol 47 for GRE).
Don't forget that if you have a firewall that you are now letting the 
people from the far end in to the inside of your firewall. So you may
want to have additional rule for data crossing the tun0 interface.
If you have masquerading turned on be sure to have the latest 2.1.131ac13
kernel.
