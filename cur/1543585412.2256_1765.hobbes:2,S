You can find the mach64 sleep notifier in atyfb.c (under
CONFIG_POWERBOOK) , the code
that calls sleep notifiers is in drivers/macintosh/via-pmu.c (the various
sleep functions).
The current mach64 & chipsfb notifiers don't do anything to fbcon (they don't
stop the cursor timer neither). I have some WIP progress code in my local
tree that
implements sleep support for more recent models with a notifier in
aty128fb too.
I added some fbcon suspend/resume routines for the cursor, but they are
currently
called from my aty128fb sleep notifier, which is wrong.
Ben.
