So maybe put a "grep" in the middle to select the ones you want or  
"grep -v" to remove the ones you don't?  I don't see why this is such  
a big deal.  There are obviously missing defines that sparse needs to  
correctly operate with kernel headers, and I'm not sure why we should  
specify them in several places in the Makefiles, including one set  
for each arch.?

But when we're using sparse to check kernel sources, it should have a  
similar set to what the regular compiler (IE: gcc) has when building  
kernel sources.

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.   
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by  
definition, not smart enough to debug it.
