People need a nice stable Operating System for networking purposes of any
type, and this exists, linux of course. What else should the world need?
People need a nice stable Operating System for Desktop and Multimedia
purposes and this doesn't exist. We should create a new stable X-Kernel with
build in support for X. Pressing Alt-F1 a console should pop up.
Boots up with X, that means.
Come on Linus, show the world what you can do, release the X-Kernel 1.01.
Hit the MS dominar where it hurts, THE DESKTOP.
Parallel release of Kernel and X-Kernel, will put Linux where it belongs,
THE TOP of course.
