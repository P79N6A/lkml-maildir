Subject: 2.6.18 - AHCI detection pauses excessively

AHCI pauses heartily on during detection boot, but eventually proceeds. 
  I've mentioned the problem before, but have since narrowed it down a 
bit.  The problem does not occur in 2.6.17.3, but does occur in 2.6.18. 
  The problem is still occurring both in 2.6.19-rc5 as well as 
2.6.19-rc5-mm1.
Please cc me on replies since I am not subscribed to LKML.
Messages surrounding the hang:

I should note that on this system ata1 and ata3 both detect quickly, but 
they have 1.5 Gbps devices whereas ata2 has a 3.0Gbps device.
