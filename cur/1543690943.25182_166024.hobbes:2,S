So you would like to remove defkeymap.c from the bitkeeper repository.
Can you briefly explain why?
I am not a bk user so have no feeling for what one would like bk to do.
But it seems to me that if defkeymap.c is only a generated file when
no kbd headers have changed, while in the opposite case one needs a
private version of loadkeys until the next version of kbd has been
distributed, it is easier to regard it as part of the kernel source.
