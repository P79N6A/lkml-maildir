Ok, I've reviewed all patches in this series except:

which I did not find anywhere ... not even on netdev@
Anyway, the entire series was OK, just removing a #include
line when that exact same header was already #include'd in
the same file. [ I also wonder if this patchset ends up exposing
some header-include-ordering problems that were previously
hidden, actually. ]

I think these are trivial and obvious enough -- can probably be
merged together into single patch by Andrew and just slammed
into the kernel tree :-)
Thanks,
