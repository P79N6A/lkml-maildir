I usually create a branch for each -mm release and add there all the
patches, eg:
	git checkout -f -b v2.6.16-rc2-mm1 v2.6.16-rc2
then do something like:
	while [ $(quilt next) ] ; do \
		quilt push && git add && git commit -a -m "$(quilt top)"; \
	done
as an alternative you canprobably checkout HEAD and git-reset --hard to
the wanted commit.
