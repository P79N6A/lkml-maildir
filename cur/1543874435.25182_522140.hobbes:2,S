Let's say you have an mmap'd file.  It has zero pages brought in right
now.  You do a write to it.  It is well within the kernel's rights to
let you write one word to an mmap'd file, then unmap it, write it to
disk, and free the page.
To me, mmap() is an interface, not a directive to tell the kernel to
keep things in memory.  The fact that two reads of a bytes from an
mmap()'d file tends to not go to disk or even cause a fault for the
second read is because the page is in the page cache.  The fact that two
consecutive read()s of the same disk page tend to not cause two trips to
the disk is because the page is in the page cache.
Anybody who wants to get data in and out of a file can choose to use
either of these interfaces.  A page being brought into the system for
either a read or touch of an mmap()'d area causes the same kind of
memory pressure.
So, I think we have a difference of opinion.  I think it's _all_ about
memory pressure, and you think it is _not_ about accounting for memory
pressure. :)  Perhaps we mean different things, but we appear to
disagree greatly on the surface.
Can we agree that there must be _some_ way to control the amounts of
unmapped page cache?  Whether that's related somehow to the same way we
control RSS or done somehow at the I/O level, there must be some way to
control it.  Agree?

I've tried to capture this:

Definitely.  I think we've all agreed that memory is the hard one,
though.  If we can make progress on this one, we're set! :)
