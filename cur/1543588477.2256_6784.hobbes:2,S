Tamas,
  you may want to read this:
    
http://encryptionhowto.sourceforge.net/Encryption-HOWTO-4.html
  the international kernel patch (www.kerneli.org) has had this
implemented for some time.  There is lot more info on crypto in Linux at:

I don't think it's that involved but you can certainly apply a cipher to a
mounted partition.

You can use it in the states but you cannot develop for it within the
states - well, the regulations changes but I am not sure if the kerneli
guys will trust that... that's a totally different debate in itself.
