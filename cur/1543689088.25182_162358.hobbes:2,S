No doubt wraparound at 137 GB. (2^28 sectors of 2^9 bytes gives a 2^37 byte,
that is 128 GiB limit; to get past this you need support for lba48)
Recently we discussed a case where Linux decided that the hardware
could not handle lba48 but forgot to adapt the total capacity.
That was a Linux bug.
In fact, if I am not mistaken, the idea that that hardware could not
handle lba48 was due to a misunderstanding. That was another Linux bug.
Maybe these have now been fixed in some kernel versions.
So, you must check (i) what Linux thinks your hardware can do, and
(ii) what your hardware can do in reality.
Maybe the former can be seen in /proc/ide/hdX/settings under "address"
or so.
