We could use the exception mechanism, and try to fix up any BIOS errors. 
That would require:
 - make the BIOS calls save all important registers just before entry (esp 
   in particular, and the "after-call EIP") and set a flag saying "fix me 
   up". Do this per-CPU. Clear the flags after exit.
 - add magic knowledge to "fixup_exception()" path that looks at the 
   per-cpu fix-me-up flag, and if it is set, restore all the segments 
   (which the BIOS may have crapped on), %esp and %eip to the magic fixup 
   values.
 - test it with a bogus trap (on purpose) which has reset all the x86 
   registers, including an offset %esp.
This could make us recover from some (most?) BIOS bugs and at least 
dynamically notice when the BIOS does bad bad things.
