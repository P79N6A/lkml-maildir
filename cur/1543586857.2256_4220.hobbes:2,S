I must admit that I haven't got a clue what that is:-)

If this is solved by merging two files or if the config system
really uses two files doesn't really matter to me.
Merging files is probably a better approach if having
non-centralised help files can be accepted.

Here are some results: 
$ wc arch/cris/Configure.help 
    621    4424   28373 arch/cris/Configure.help
$ wc Documentation/Configure.help 
  17480  121037  773694 Documentation/Configure.help
$ grep CONFIG arch/cris/Configure.help |wc
     75     138    2337
$ grep CONFIG Documentation/Configure.help |wc
   1486    1640   30135
it's not entiraly correct since the CONFIG_BLUETOOTH help
is in the arch/cris directory and that should probably be in
Documentation/ or in the OpenBT package and merged from there.
The file also contains the # LocalWords: rows from the original
Configure.help.
But the ETRAX/CRIS config is 3-5% of the total config.
 
Having the help close to the config sounds like a good idea
from a maintenance point of view.

Sounds better than dealing with two different help files in the
config system.
Is there an ETA when ESR CML2 will be in the official kernel?
(I guess I should catch up on what it will provide instead of
 wasting peoples time...)
Would adding support for merging help files in the current config 
system be accepted in the meanwhile?
E.g. Configure, Menuconfig and header.tk is changed to use
Documentation/Configure.help.generated
and the top Makefile does
cat $(HELPFILES) >Documentation/Configure.help.generated 2>/dev/null
for oldconfig, config, menuconfig and xconfig targets?
And HELPFILES is set to:
HELPFILES = arch/$(ARCH)/Configure.help Documentation/Configure.help
External patches that add functionality could easaly add 
HELPFILES += some new help files 
rows to get the help as well.
