when we get the content of /proc/bus/usb/devices for this one. Do you
have the manufacturer name of it or at least an idea which kind of
device this is. Check "hciconfig hci0 version".
Dave, I don't think this is a broken dongle. I think he hits the case of
eSCO versus SCO connection (the fallback to SCO case). I am working on
the proper fix for that, but that is not as simple as it seems.
