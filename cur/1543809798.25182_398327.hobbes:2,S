Ok, hard to argue with that logic but we knew we were going to be dealing
with some sort of tunable when zone-based-anti-frag was first discussed.

I would like to see this in -mm getting a trial while I work on the moving
pages from EasyRclm to DMA/HighMem problem. I feel that there is a logical
progression from kernelcore= boot option to a sysctl (or something
similar) that is adjustable at runtime. When the code exists to size the
zone at runtime, it can be built on top of the majority of this patchset.
They are not mutually exclusive.
Before even trying to get into -mm though, I should fix the
dealing-with-memory-holes-on-ppc first (more below).

Well, they'll have different ways to screw up. Once the EasyRclm zone can
be resized, they might decide to migrate it all to DMA and then cannot
hotplug anything putting them back in square one. I need to think about
this a bit more to see how it'll work in practice.

c) all of the above. This section of the patch is not winning any prizes
for clarity.

Your previous mail about having a function similar to get_region() that
returns the number of present pages in a pfn range feels like the right
approach. I'll work on this before touching zone resizing and post another
version.

Bah, you're right, I just am not too keen on admitting it on a Friday
evening :).
