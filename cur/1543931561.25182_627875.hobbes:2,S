This one is the exception to checkpatch.pl's rule against "volatile".  ;-)
The volatile declaration is within the ACCESS_ONCE() macro that is used
within rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock() to force the compiler to
maintain ordering with respect to interrupt handler running only on that
same CPU.
