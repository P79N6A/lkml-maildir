Isn't this Linux's shortcoming? NT could always access odd last sectors.
Actually in the majority of cases it stores the backup of its boot sector
in the last sector of the partition for recovery purpose (outside of NTFS).
Anton made a fix for this years ago. It's PITA (and wasting time)
explaining and working around constantly how Linux can (not) access it.
Is it fixed in 2.6?
