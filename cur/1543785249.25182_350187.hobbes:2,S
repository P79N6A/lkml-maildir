Exactly.  clock_getres() on CLOCK_REALTIME will get the resolution of 
timers (itimers or posix timers on CLOCK_REALTIME.  You can also get the 
res using the old itimer interface by programing a repeating time of 1 
usec and then reading back the timer (get_timer ?).  Set a longish 
initial time so you can delete the timer prior to its expiring and look 
at the repeat time returned.  Do be aware that this will be rounded up, 
however, and will likely show, e.g. 1000 usec for 999849 ns (as returned 
by clock_getres()).  Either of these interfaces is in the 2.6 kernel 
these days.

Thanks for the plug :)
