I believe this is what's happening - i8042_interrupt is getting called at a
very fast rate and we never do anything else.  (I suppose that's the
definition of an interrupt storm - this is my first foray into kernel
programming aside from fixing compiler errors.)
As others have suggested, booting with "pci=noacpi" fixes the problem.
(Leaving the debug statement in there, I'd estimate that i8042_interrupt
gets called at about 25 times a second - about a screenfull a second or
so.)
So, anyone else with this problem can plug in a PS/2 mouse or boot with
"pci=noacpi" to work around it.
The last thing I would mention is that 2.5.75 ran fine on this machine, so
I guess this problem has crept in since then.

I did apply this patch, and it did not visibly help.
Thanks for the help, let me know if you'd like me to try anything else.
Take care,
