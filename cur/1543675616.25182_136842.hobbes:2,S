Subject: [PATCH] fix sysenter crash with enabled nmi oopser
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
below is again my patch to the nmi entry point: without it, I can't boot
RH9 with both nmi oopser and page unmapping enabled.
Background:
The nmi handler must detect the combination of nmi+syscall+debug fault. It
does that by reading from (%esp)16. This can crash, if it's a "normal" nmi
and (%esp)16 doesn't exist - either above end-of-memory, or the page that
follows behind the stack is unmapped for AGP GART. RH9 crashes on every
boot with page unmap debugging enabled, the interrupted %eip is
sysenter_past_esp.
Could you apply the patch to your tree? I would prefer a symbolic constant
instead of 0x1fff (THREAD_SIZE-1) and 0x1fec
(THREAD_SIZE-3*sizeof(unsigned long)), but the current definitions are not
compatible with the assembler.
