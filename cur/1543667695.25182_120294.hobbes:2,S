No, I was just suggesting an approach that may work, in case
somebody wants to fix this. SIGSTOP/CONT doesn't seem like a
very popular communication mechanism anyway.
I did notice that two processes trying to ptrace each other
end up being unkillably deadlocked on 2.4.18, which a fix
for the SIGSTOP problem may resolve, but I didn't check if
this still happens in more recent kernels. ("Don't do it" is
a satisfactory work-around.)
I'll worry about such subtleties once I've made heads and
tails of how UML's ptrace-relay interacts with process
termination :-)
