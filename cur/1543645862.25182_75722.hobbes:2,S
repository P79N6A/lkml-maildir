Unfortunately, the clustering support will not be added before the end of 
Oct. I may just remove those two files from the tree for the time being to 
keep things clean, since I've already disabled the option to build them.

We've tried to clean up both the 2.4 and 2.5 trees. However, since we are 
only intending on submitting the code for 2.5, that has been our priority.
The S/390 plugin should be easy to clean up and port to 2.5, and I've already 
made an initial attempt at it. However, I've been told that 2.5 may not be 
able to compile and/or run on S/390, so testing that plugin may prove to be 
difficult. If anyone has an tips (or just a URL) on running 2.5 on S/390, 
please let us know.

Yeah, the AIX plugin apparently still needs some work. Those #ifdef 
EVMS_DEBUG statments can probably just be thrown out. We'll get AIX taken 
care of this week.

We will.

That's the plan. As I said, the cluster code won't be ready, and may be 
removed from the tree.  I'm going to try to get the last two plugins 
converted over this week. The MD issues will be addressed.
Thank you for your feedback. If you see any other immediate issues, please 
let us know.
