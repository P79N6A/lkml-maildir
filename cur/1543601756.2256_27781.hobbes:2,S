Is there any particular (that is, technical) reason for this?  A few months
ago I hit this problem while building a RAID system for our group.  We wanted
to do software RAID-0 over three hardware RAID-5 arrays (2 by 375G and one
525G) and the kernel (2.4.6) had a hissy fit.
Given the relatively low cost of disk space ($5000/terabyte and on up, see
http://staff.sdsc.edu/its/terafile/
), is this something that will be supported
in the future?
If you point me in the right direction I'd be willing to look at this issue.
Thanks
-Eric
