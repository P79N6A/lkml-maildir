The optimisations are worth several %age points on some benchmarks - the
prefetching memory copier it uses basically hits the full bus bandwidth on
memory copies which rep movs will not do.
My current speculation is that the sdram setup on some of these boards can't
actually take the full CPU spec caused by these hand tuned routines. There is
some evidence to support that as several other boards only work with Athlon
optimisation if you set the BIOS options to 'conservative' not 'optimised'
Equally we don't see the problem on AMD chipset boards and we don't know if
that indicates a bug in the kernel not tripped on such boards or a chipset
problem (even BIOS setuo maybe) on the VIA.
