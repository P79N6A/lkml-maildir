Hi guys,
I've modified the "up" routine coded in file sched.c to get 
more speed and, IMVHO more correctness.
Previous code in __wake_up() release all task that ( except one ) 
goes immediatly scheduled.
Given:
N = Number of tasks in runqueue
M = Number of tasks in semaphore queue
L = The cost of linear scan of wait queue of semaphore
W = The cost of a wakeup() operation
S = The cost of a schedule() search of next to run
the total cost of a "up" operation is:
TCo =  L + M * W + (M - 1) * S
My new implementation release only the best suitable process to run, 
resulting in a cost:
TCn = L + W
The new code linear scan the semaphore queue list and pick the best 
task to wakeup ( in a goodness sense ).
If the process counters is exhausted ( it happens very rarely ) I've 2 
way to follow:
1) Do a recalculate loop inside __wake_up()
2) Leave this case to fall into the previous implementation and releasing all tasks
I choose 2 to leave process counter recharging inside the schedule() function.
Tomorrow I'll post to linux-kernel my patch as long as a test program and 
speed results.
Cheers,
	Davide.
