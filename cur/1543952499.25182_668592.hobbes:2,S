I agree and I tried to avoid the splattering

There are other problems
1. vm_(un)acct_memory is conditionally dependent on VM_ACCOUNT. Look at
shmem_(un)acct_size for example
2. These routines are not called from all contexts that we care about (look at
insert_special_mapping())

I am going to split mem_cgroup_update_as() to two routines with a better name. I
agree with you in principle about splattering, but please see my comments above
