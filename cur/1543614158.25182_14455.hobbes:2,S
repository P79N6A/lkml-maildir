>Not true. Bandwidth is measured in metric.
If by this you mean that in networking, a megabit per second is equal to
1000^2, or a gigabit per second is 1000^3, then my response consists of:
Uhm, no.
If your response (I haven't followed this whole thread, so I'm not up on
all of the discussion here) is concerning the capitalization and such
used for it, then I really don't care which it is as the purpose is to
communicate, and strict adherence to capitalization just isn't that
important to communication.  *shrug*

This makes me think you're concerned about powers of 2 versus powers of
10.  In which case, reference my response above.
