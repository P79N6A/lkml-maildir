The sorting function you add should be covered by the ifdef you add.

The purpose is irrelevant to the effect on existing drivers and systems 
-- which is unknown.  Making the probe order independent of BIOS 
ordering may very well break drivers and systems that are dependent on 
BIOS ordering.  IOW what looks nice on your system could _likely_ suck 
for others.  That's what I meant by "x86 PCI code is very touchy."
