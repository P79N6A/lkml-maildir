As I said on my previous email, "master" branch have just a few small
fixing patches (26 patches, changing 39 files). We have several
improvements to 2.6.19 on "devel" branch. I suspect you've pulled the
wrong branch. At the time you tried to pull, "devel" were marked as the
current branch. Please re-check.
$ git checkout -f master
