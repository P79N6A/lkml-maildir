You're probably correct, I already have a "sleep 1" that I missed to
include in my e-mail though.
Let's not analyze the backup method so much, it's not a very important
machine and I mostly want config files to be backed up and they are
pretty consistent at all times anyway.

You are correct about the aborted journal but it's not caused by
anythingelse than the lvm snapshot.

Ok, I used another Xen VM for testing now.
While I was testing now I noticed that I even could take the snapshot
while the system is not started and the error would still occur.
No problems with ext3 with the same kernel that I've seen yet.
Here's one way to reproduce:
# lvs | grep xenfw2
  xenfw2          3w250g -wi-a-   1.00G # Notice the last "-" which is
not "o"
  xenfw2_swap     3w250g -wi-a- 196.00M
# lvcreate --snapshot --permission rw --size 1G --name xenfw2_s
/dev/3w250g/xenfw2
  Logical volume "xenfw2_s" created
# lvs | grep xenfw2
  xenfw2          3w250g owi-a-   1.00G
  xenfw2_s        3w250g swi-a-   1.00G xenfw2   0.00
  xenfw2_swap     3w250g -wi-a- 196.00M
# xm create xenfw2 -c # To start the Xen VM with console attached
Here's what I think is the relevant part of the kernel output
