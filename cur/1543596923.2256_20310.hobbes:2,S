I'm not sure if an extra tcp error would have helped me with this.  I
would still have had to learn the details of tcp (acks, delayed acks,
checksum, buffers) in order to learn that a tcp checksum problem could
have produced the behavior I was seeing.
An error notifying me of irq conflicts would have _really_ helped.
Robert.
