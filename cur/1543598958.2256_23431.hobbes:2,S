Hi,
I'm using a C3 700MHz CPU underclocked to 466MHz (66MHz FSB),
and @ full load I'm getting the CPU to 63°C in a fanless 1U case.
What I would like is to throttle the CPU back X% if the temperature
exceeds say 50% which I can easily read using lm sensors.
So, what's the best way to do this? user space / kernel space??
Note the C3 has a suspend on halt (instruction) option which will
help things also.
cheers,
Padraig.
