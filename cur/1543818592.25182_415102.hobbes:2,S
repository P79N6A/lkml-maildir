Subject: [Patch:000/005] wait_table and zonelist initializing for memory hotadd
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi.
These are patches for initialization of wait_table and updating of zonelists
for memory hot-add.
These patches can be used when a new node/zone becomes available.
When empty zone becomes not empty by memory hot-add, 
wait_table must be initialized, and zonelists must be updated.
  ex) x86-64 is good example of new zone addition.
      - System boot up with memory under 4G address.
        All of memory will be ZONE_DMA32.
      - Then hot-add over 4G memory. It becomes ZONE_NORMAL. But, 
        wait table of zone normal is not initialized at this time.
This patch is for 2.6.17-rc1-mm2.
Please apply.
----------------------------
Change log from v1 of wait_table init and build_zonelist.
  - update for 2.6.17-rc1-mm2.
  - add comment for wait_table hash entries.
  - change name wait_table_size() -> wait_table_hash_nr_entries()
Change log from v4 of node hot-add.
  - wait_table and build_zonelists updating are picked up.
  - update for 2.6.17-rc1-mm1.
  - change allocation for wait_table from kmalloc() to vmalloc().
    vmalloc() is enough for it.
V4 of post is here.
