That's a fair question.
It seems to me the only effects of a larger scale than necessary
are (a) the buffer size can be increased after the connection is
established, and (b) coarser granularity which can only degrade
performance over low mss links.
So why do we set a larger window scale than necessary?
Is it to support (a)?
