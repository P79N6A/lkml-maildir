Hi,
here is the second try to add bcm47xx support to the b44 driver. Changes since 
the first version:
- Splitted the patch into logical hunks
- Ignore carrier lost errors (buggy hardware)
- Added CAM read support
- Read MAC from CAM instead of hardcoding a dummy MAC into the driver
- Use a special PHY address (0x30) to indicate that there is no PHY (this is 
compatible with the Broadcom et and 4401 driver)
- Added MDIO value calculation based on the backplane speed
Comments welcome!
Regards,
   Florian
