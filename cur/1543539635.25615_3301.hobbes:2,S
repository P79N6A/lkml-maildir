You bring up a very good point here as well.  I'd like to add to
it that this will mirror itself into the Linux environment as
well.  Lets say tomorrow everyone woke up with Linux on their
computers - having replaced windows overnight magically, and that
all of their windows knowledge was transplanted into equivalent
Linux knowledge.
The EXACT SAME stupid things, and insecurities would occur.  Joe
blow running netscape as root and getting a buffer overflow, or
ILOVEUNIX virus, or similar.  No different really.  Things would
be slightly better, but the USER is the problem here, not the
OS.  Linux would likely prevent more things from occuring than
does NT or W2K, but it cant stop a dumb user or careless user.

heheh.  Well, its good to see World Domination 101 having an
effect.  Completes the control-feedback loop.  ;o)
Take care,
