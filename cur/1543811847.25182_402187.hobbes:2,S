While DVD-RAM has per-sector embossing of headers, the ECC size is
still 16 sectors, so writing any one sector requires a read-modify-write
pass.

DVD+RW and theoretically DVD-RW support writing of 32K chunks randomly
on the disk.  DVD+RW has a tight tolerance on positioning (+/-16 bits)
and DVD-RW about 150 bytes.  Both rely on ECC to correct those bits,
though DVD+RW obviously eats less of the ECC budget.  Neither format
uses a special packet format.  The drives themselves are supposed to do
read-modify-write as required.

Fixed packet writing is only a CD attribute.
Using 128 sector packets will likely break UDF interchangeability, and
likely even some drive firmware.
