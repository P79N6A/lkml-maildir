Ok, the merge window for 2.6.21 has closed, and -rc1 is out there.
There's a lot of changes, as is usual for an -rc1 thing, but at least so 
far it would seem that 2.6.20 has been a good base, and I don't think we 
have anything *really* scary here.
The most interesting core change may be the dyntick/nohz one, where timer 
ticks will only happen when needed. It's been brewing for a _loong_ time, 
but it's in the standard kernel now as an option. 
But there's a ton of architecture updates (arm, mips, powerpc, x86, you 
name it), ACPI updates, and lots of driver work. And just a lot of 
cleanups.
Have fun,
			Linus
