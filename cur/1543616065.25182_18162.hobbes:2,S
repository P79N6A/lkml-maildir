I have a feeling the OOM detection in rmap10c isn't working
out because of another issue ... I think it has something to
do with the swap allocation failure path indirectly triggering
OOM, I think I'll go audit the code now ;)
(oh the wonders of maintaining code ... auditing everybody's
code and tracking down bugs instead of doing fun development ;))
cheers,
Rik
