Hi Peter,
The question you ask can be answered trivially - yes, it is definitely a
good idea, please make such a patch. But what is far from being trivial is
the magic reg. expression that is capable of catching all "globals
initialized to 0 or NULL". It would be very useful if you showed everyone
how you did it. I seriously thought of "simply" reading entire 2279844
lines of C code to catch all "data->bss" cases but if you can have grep(1)
do that for me then that may save quite a lot of time :)
Regards,
Tigran
