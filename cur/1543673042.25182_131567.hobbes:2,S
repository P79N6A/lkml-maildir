Hello
I've been unable to spot any information whether I should assume that ISDN
just doesn't work yet in 2.5.x, or whether I should keep on trying to make
it work.  All hints are appreciated.
I only get lots of unknown symbols when trying to modprobe hisax.
I've used hisax succesfully with a HFC PCI card and 2.4.20 kernel.
