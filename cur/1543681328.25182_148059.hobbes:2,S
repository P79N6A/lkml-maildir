How does one measure the reliability and security of current software TCP/IP 
stacks?  Some standard set of test would have to be identified and the TOEs 
would need to be tested against this to ensure that they meet some minimum 
standard.  I would suggest offloading the minimum amount from the OS so that 
most of the control could be maintaind by the OS stack.  This also would 
make failover/routing changes between TOE -TOE, and TOE-NIC easier.  Current 
offloads such as checksum and segmentation will not be enough for 10GbE 
processing, so it would have to be something more than we have today.
