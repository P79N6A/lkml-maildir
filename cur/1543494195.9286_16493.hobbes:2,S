Hello all,
since Kernel 2.2.5 (or earlier) it seems I have some problems with my
NICs.
I have hundreds of Messages like this :
Apr 29 15:16:08 rhb kernel: eth0: No link beat on the MII interface,
status then
Apr 29 15:16:43 rhb kernel: eth2: Tx timed out, lost interrupt?
TSR=0x1, ISR=0x2
The eth0-thing ("tulip" Fast Ethernet with DECs 21140) is ok, it is my
connection to my X-Terminal which is "off" sometimes (TP X-over cable)
but why is this a reason for the kernel to remind me every minute that
it is off? How can I turn this warning off? The connection is without
any devices "between" like HUBs or switches.
The eth2-thing ("ne2000-comat"-pnp) is mysterious ... how ca a device
"loose" its IRQ? I never had problems like this before.
TIA
Raphael Becker
