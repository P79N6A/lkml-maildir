Yes, it is different. Why are you insisting, that something is a problem
just because it is different ?

Simply because it works and it does not make any sense to have a per cpu
timer (lapic) and the PIT firing at the same periodic interval. PIT does
nothing else than jiffies64++. The clockevents code just optimizes that
away and lets one cpu do the jiffies64++ in its periodic per cpu
interrupt.
So where is the problem ?

Uurg. /proc/interrupts has nothing to do with timers. It's interrupts
statistics. See LOC entry for the lapic ones.
