Hi,
I just upgraded from 2.6.13.4 to 2.6.20 on a Pentium M, and on booting 
off an NFS root encountered the following bug somewhere after loading 
the w83627hf module and before ohci1394:

  =======================
So far the machine appears stable other than this - but after having had 
a year or so of perfect uptime on the box under 2.6.13.4 with no such 
kernel errors, I thought you might like to know in case this indicates 
something more serious.
The kernel options given to boot off NFS were...
root=/dev/nfs rw 
nfsroot=192.168.0.x:/home/stb,v3,hard,intr,nolock,retrans=6,rsize=16384,wsize=16384 
ip=dhcp
...and the full dmesg, kernel config, lspci and lsmod output may be 
found at 
http://www.arasphere.net/linux/nfs-bug.
  The NFS server is 
running the default NFS v3 options on 2.6.20 on Core 2 Duo.  No patches 
have been applied to either kernel.
Any advice on whether I should be worried by this, whether it indicates 
that something significant is wrong, and how I might help debug it would 
be appreciated.
thanks.
Matthew.
