Strace 4.0 has been released!
Since the last major release (version 3.1) a lot of things have
changed. This release should work on most Linux architectures
(it was tested on i386, alpha, sparc, m68k and powerpc), SunOS,
Solaris and (some versions of) IRIX. Of course we've also added
a lot of new system calls and fixed a nice number of bugs.
A couple of popular features are not supported yet (most noticably
proper clone() support for Linux). Now that strace 4.0 has been
released we can work on adding new features.
Please read the global README and the README for your OS when you
compile strace!
For Linux there are now also a couple of kernel patches available at
the strace homepage that make strace usage a bit more pleasant.
If you have questions, remarks or patches you can send those to the
strace mailinglist. You can subscribe by sending an email with the subject
"subscribe" to strace-request@lists.wiggy.net.  You can post to the list by
sending mail to strace@lists.wiggy.net.
You can get strace at two locations:
 * homepage at 
http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~wichert/strace/
 * CVS archive at :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/strace,
