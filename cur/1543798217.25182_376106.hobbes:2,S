Because that would change the current semantics of what
LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_POWER_OFF.
It is painful enough getting the infrastructure change through without
the having to worry about breaking userspace as well.
Despite what it may look like this is purely to fix bugs in the
implementation.
If I was going to hack user space the quick fix is to remove the -p
flag passed to /sbin/halt in the reboot scripts.
