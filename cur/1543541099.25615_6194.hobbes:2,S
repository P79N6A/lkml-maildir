This is a pretty common problem on Abit BP6 mobo's, which is anything but a rare
motherboard , especially amongst DIY at-home Linuxerati and BSDers.  I know that I
have this problem every time I boot Linux  on my BP6,  and never had it on my Intel
DK440FX motherboard.  A lot of the time, if I go into the BIOS setup and tell it to
update the ESCD information, then  it will boot.  But not always.  Of course,
WindowsNT has no problem, so I think it's something that Linux could handle if the
developer or developers responsible for that code wanted to make it a priority.  I
know that there is a lot of disdain for this mobo expressed by certain kernel
maintainers on the kernel list, possibly for this reason and that this is a bug in
the BIOS of these boards, but it seems like a work around is possible if Windows
never has a problem.  Perhaps NT somehow "falls back" to not using the APIC if it
detects a problem.  I have noticed that NT takes a lot longer to boot on this
motherboard than it does on any other that I have.  Voodoo engineering, I know, but
there you have it.
For me, the problem is very inconsistent and flaky, but it virtually never works the
first time I try to boot the system.  It always happens when the kernel/aic7xxx  is
trying to identify the drives, and the number of drives that get identified before it
starts the timing out business is never the same, although it usually gets at least
one drive indentified.  If it gets past identifying the drives, the system works fine
for semi-infinite periods of time.  Adaptec 2940 UW.
