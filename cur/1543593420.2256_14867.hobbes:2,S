Well, my rebuild kernel / reboot / recompile module just finished.
Unfortunately, the printk warning was still there.
I replaced the unconditional #define MODVERSIONS with
#include <linux/config.h>
#ifdef CONFIG_MODVERSIONS
#define MODVERSIONS
#include <linux/modversions.h>
#endif
this is at the top of my source file. (before module.h and linux.h)
(as seen somewhere on the web)
and it compiles without warnings now.
Now all I need is some info on module oparameters and using /proc :)
Thanks again.
