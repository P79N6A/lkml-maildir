there's also the need to turn on non-blocking i/o, to enable
close-on-exec, and to disable nagle (or set the cork).  but collapsing
syscalls is kind of a bad thing to do.
what if there were:
    accept2(int s_listen, struct sockaddr *, int *addrlen, int s_client);
where s_client is a socket created by socket() with its options all set up
as desired by the application?  that way the app can do the F_SETSIG/etc.
before it is attached to the network.
hmm, would it be possible to reuse the socket on the other end -- after
the app does a shutdown() for both directions?  that could be interesting.
