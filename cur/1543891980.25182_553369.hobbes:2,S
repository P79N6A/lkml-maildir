If you don't have DMA capabilities, does libata still need ->pad and
->pad_dma set?
I had a problem where a pata_platform device which wasn't DMA capable
failed to initialise because we quite rightfully made dma_alloc_coherent()
fail (due to the DMA masks not being set.)
It seems odd that libata requires DMA memory for non-DMA capable devices...
