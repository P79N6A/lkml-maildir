Unfortunately some errors are so bad that the entire system hangs.
That hang includes the klogd and syslogd tasks which take kernel
messages and write them to disk.  So these really nasty errors never
appear in /var/log.  Three choices at the moment.
If the full oops is on the screen, use shift-pageup to see the whole
thing, write it down by hand and type it in after you have rebooted.
You can use a serial console (Documentation/serial-console.txt) to feed
the logs to another machine and capture it there.
Willy Tarreau <willy@novworld.Novecom.Fr> has written a patch that lets
you dump the messages to floppy, even when the rest of the system is
hung.  
http://www-miaif.lip6.fr/willy/pub/linux-patches/kmsgdump/
In all three cases, after you reboot, run the Oops through ksymoops.
The kernel version of ksymoops is obsolete and will disappear once
Linus starts accepting patches.  The current version is in
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops/
