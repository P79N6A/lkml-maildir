Jan - there is obviously no way I could apply this patch
so late in the cycle. 
The original patch that made this a CONFIG option is
then much better as we avoid forcing new and untested
behaviour on the users.
We all know that compressing the modules are simple.
And unless someone comes up with *very* good arguments
then we should just use gzip with default parameters.
If we go for the "keep the .ko extension but compress"
then someone needs to answer the obvious questions:
- will this break on a typical distribution
- will this break busybox users
