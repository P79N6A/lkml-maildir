I will try, but compiling the kernels take time even with 3 machines 
(one per kernel version)...
I compared the dmesg log of the different kernel, but since I don't know 
what I should find it's a little difficult. There is many differences 
between each kernels. Despit that, I noticed this difference between the 
kernel 2.6.9 (ntps working) and the kernel 2.6.10 (ntpd failed):
