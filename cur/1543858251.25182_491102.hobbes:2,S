That is what the 'struct nfs_page' does. Whenever possible (i.e.
whenever the VM uses prepare_write()/commit_write()), we use that to
track the exact area of the page that was dirtied. That means that we
don't need to care what is on the rest of the page, or whether or not
the page was originally uptodate since we will only flush out the area
of the page that contains data.

Nope.
