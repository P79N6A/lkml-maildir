Well, for 2.6.22, Kprobes will just be disabled if you use DEBUG_RODATA.
And yes, that patch already got merged. However, the patch to *allow* 
Kprobes with DEBUG_RODATA is not, and will not be. It's not a regression, 
and quite frankly, I don't think I would even want that patch.
Kprobes fundamntally disagrees with DEBUG_RODATA, there's no point in 
"working around it". Better just admit it.
