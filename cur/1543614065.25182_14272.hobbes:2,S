Looking pretty good.  I have one improvement.
I'd rather you pass the "kmem_cache_t" directly into sk_alloc, use
NULL for "I don't have any extra private area".
And then, for the IP case lay it out like this:
	struct sock
	struct ip_opt
	struct {tcp,raw4,...}_opt
And use different kmem_cache_t's for each protocol instead of
the same one for tcp, raw4, etc.
RAW/UDP sockets waste a lot of space with your current layout.
