 > I'm trying the little leak tracking patch from Alexander Nyberg now.
Here are the results (only backtraces with more than 10k counts
included). The leak was at 1G of memory at the time I ran this, so its
safe to say 10k page allocations ain't enough to explain it :-)
I also attach a hacked version of the pgown sort program that sorts
the output by count, and isn't O(n^2). It took 10 minutes to run the
old version :-)
I'm guessing the leak is in the new xattr code given that is what
dbench and nbench were beating on. Andreas, can you look at the
following and see if you can spot anything?
This was on 2.6.11-rc2 with the pipe leak patch from Linus. The
machine had leaked 1G of ram in 10 minutes, and was idle (only thing
running was sshd).
Cheers, Tridge
