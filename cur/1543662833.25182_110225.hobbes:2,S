Oh, you're right, and you're right exactly _because_ "task->signal" isn't
protected by the task lock right now. Aurgh. I had already mentally done
that protection, which is why I thought we already had the bug.
So never mind. 2.4.x is obviously also ok.

The patch looks ok, although I'd also remove the locking and testing from
collect_sigign_sigcatch() once it is done at a higher level.
And yeah, what about signal delivery? Put back the same lock there?
