I've been seeing this problem since I tried 2.1.130. It happens even
with an updated isdn4kernel. I'm not sure how to fix this, or even sure
how to find out what exactly is causing this. I've reported it to the
isdn4linux team a couple of months ago, but it seems they're at a loss
what's causing it as well. You might want to check the isdn4linux mailing-
list archives.

When I shop for hardware I always look for the "Designed for Windows 95" logo.
I really thank Microsoft(TM) for encouraging manufacturers to label their
products this way, so I know what to AVOID.
I stick to quality software:
