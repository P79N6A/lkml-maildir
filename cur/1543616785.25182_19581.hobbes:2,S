And why don't you connect those two NICs with the same MACs to
the same HUB and see how well that works.

If you have two NICs with the identical MAC address on the same segment,
your ethernet routing will become confused.  The ARP table keeps a map
of MAC to IP address.   This table assumes a 1 to 1 relationship.   If you
try to reach a host but fail due to routing issues, then ICMP sends out 
DESTINATION HOST UNKNOWN/HOST UNREACHABLE messages.  
So, ICMP and very much to do with ARP.
The whole ISO Model is flawed because there really is not
a clean delineation among the layers.   For example, BGP uses TCP
to route IP, so it's an ISO layer 3 process, but it makes use of TCP
which is layer 4.  So, you need layer 4 to define layer 3.   Crazy huh.
The same argument can be shifted to the Internet Model, which is
IHMO, an after-the-fact idea that came from trying to apply ISO to
Internet.
