So far, no crash.  But now I have NFS clients that from time to time are unable
to access this server.  The server has the following messages on it:
Aug 31 15:16:43 funnel rpc.mountd: getfh failed: Operation not permitted
I can temporarily fix the problem by typing:
exportfs -ar
But eventually it happens again.
