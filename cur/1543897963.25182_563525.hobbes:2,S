Exactly what I had in mind.

Come to think of it, I believe that gdb doesn't check beyond the first 
DR_TRAPn bit it finds set.  I can live with reporting only the last 
hit.

That should work well.  But how does the handler know whether a ptrace
trigger occurred?  I can think of several possible ways, none of them
very attractive.  Simply checking the vdr6 value might not work.  The
simplest approach would be to see if the trigger callback address is
equal to ptrace_triggered -- it's a hack but it is reliable.
For that matter, knowing when to set vdr6 is a little tricky.  I guess
it should be set whenever a debug exception occurs in user mode (which
includes both breakpoints and single-step events).  But what about
ptrace triggers while the CPU is in kernel mode?  Should they set the
four DR_TRAPn bits in vdr6 and leave the rest alone?

Sounds reasonable.  I'll split it out.
