Well I can now report success on my Toshiba. gpm and X are successfully
working with my USB mouse :) (however if I enable Zaxismapping for
the wheel to work, I can no longer use the onboard mouse at the same
time. oh well)

Well, this occurs in single user mode immediately after powering on.
Also, lspci shows the graphics card on pin A, and indeed if I've
setpci'd pin C to an alternative IRQ, X still works.
Any idea how to figure out the source of the interrupt? I've run
setpci to dump register 3d on all devices which is listed as the
interrupt pin for some devices, but it comes up with nothing.
I presume this interrupt is going to have some, however small,
effect on my system, so it would be nice to eliminate it.
One other question, from what I can gather all handlers linked
to the PCI interrupt are called each time the PCI irq is
generated, but the handlers don't seem to check that their
device generated the interrupt. Is that correct?
