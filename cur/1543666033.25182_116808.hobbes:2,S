We just ran into this too at osdl.  I have something that gets the
driver to load, but I'm not sure what the right thing is to do.
The cmd_per_lun element of the driver_template is set to
AAC_NUM_IO_FIB.  This is 512. 
During probe, scsi_alloc_sdev is called.  It calls
scsi_adjust_queue_depth with the cmd_per_lun value. 
scsi_adjust_queue_depth returns without doing anything if the tags value
is greater than 256.  This leaves the Scsi_Device queue_depth at zero. 
Later when an I/O is queued, scsi_request_fn checks for device_busy >=
queue_depth.  If so, the function does a break and exits.  This is where
it hangs.
To get things to load I set cmd_per_lun to 256.  I don't know if the is
the correct way to deal with the problem.  Maybe someone else can say
something about that.
