nice catch!
fine for -mm, but i dont think we need this fix in 2.6.13, as the effect 
of the bug is an extra context-switch per 'CPU goes idle' event, in this 
very specific (and arguably broken) task binding scenario. In a 
worst-case scenario a CPU going idle can 'spam' that other CPU with 
migration requests, but it still seems like a pretty artificial workload 
scenario where the system has significant idle time left. I have tested 
your fix on a HT box and it solves the problem.
