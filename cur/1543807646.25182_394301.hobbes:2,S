2.6.16-rc2 with the libata patch alan cox provided resulted in a system 
which correctly found my atapi drive on the pata bus.  
Also, moving from the mm kernels to 2.6.16-rc2 resulted in my pm timer 
working again. 
So, it may have been all along that libata had supported my atapi 
device, but either the patch when it got merged with mm became broken or 
something else in mm broke it, and something else in mm caused my pm 
timer to stop being used. 
Hopefully more people chime in with issues like this so the bug can be 
tracked down in mm before the offending code makes it's way to a regular 
release. 
Also just to note, the patch to 2.6.16-rc2 alan cox made switches the 
load order of pata and sata from mm, resulting in device name changes.  
I guess now is a good time to start making label'd mounting a priority 
in getting into actual use on my machine.
