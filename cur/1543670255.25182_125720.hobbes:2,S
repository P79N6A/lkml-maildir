My bad for not reading the subject line more closely.

The code that prints "ieee1394: Remote root is not IRM capable,
resetting..." was added almost 2 months ago to the 1394 SVN trunk, so
its still fairly recent and probably after 2.5.59.  If this message
repeats rapidly under recent 2.5.*, then there is a problem with
initiating a bus reset and forcing the local node to be root.  My
recollection of the 1394 spec is that PHY packet needs to be sent out to
all nodes to clear the their root hold-off bit and the local node sets
its own root hold-off bit.  The OHCI 1394 code doesn't appear to do
anything special to send a PHY packet (it does set the root hold-off bit
in the local PHY chip) and I wonder if that might not be the source of
this problem.  Does anyone, who understands the PHY chip, know if it
automatically sends the appropriate PHY packet when this bit is set?  If
not, we may need to add code to send it.
If anyone can answer the one question I posed above, I'd greatly
appreciate it.
Thanks,
