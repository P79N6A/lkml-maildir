Get a better sound card...
If you are sufficiently advanced to be compiling your own kernel instead
of using a nicely packaged one (from Linux-Mandrake for example :)),
then you should expect to jump through some extra hoops to get the
functionality you desire.
As SB is ISA, probing a fixed list of ports (or even a single port) can
be pretty ugly if you don't have the expected hardware present on those
port(s).
