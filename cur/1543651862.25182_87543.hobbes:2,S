I don't know.  This sequencing really needs to be thought about
and written down, else we'll just have an ongoing fiasco trying
to graft stuff onto it.
In this case I'd say "all interrupts".  The secondary really
should be 100% dormant until all CPU_UP_PREPARE callouts have
been run and have returned NOTIFY_OK.
At least, that's how I'd have designed it.
