And I look forward to your "du" interface the kernel, too.  It uses
this terrible method of statting every file!
Now, according to wli, there's a real problem with starvation by saturating
the read side of the tasklist_lock so eg. the write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock)
in exit.c's release_task causes a CPU to spin for ages (forever?) with
interrupts off.  This needs fixing, be it RCU or making that particular
lock give way to writers, or some other effect.
But the "ps takes too much time from my benchmarks" is a "don't do that".
Or you may really hate the /dev/kmem hack, but it's simple and effective.
The "hundreds of users doing ps/top" is easily solved with a "ps" daemon.
Fixing top is probably a worthwhile thing to do, and you'll note that after
the first iteration it should be rarely neccessary to read every "stat"
proc file.
Optimize userspace before putting a hack into the kernel, *please*!
Rusty.
