Regarding the patch: maybe it's better to spell this entry
"Quicklists" than "QuickLists", since quicklist is a single word and
not two words ?
Regarding the memory occupied by quicklists: why does the amount of
memory occupied by quicklists increase over time ? Is there a way to
free the memory occupied by quicklists, similar to the way the memory
occupied by caches can be freed (echo 3 >/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches) ?
Bart.
