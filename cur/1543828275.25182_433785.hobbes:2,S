It helps a lot when trying to decode oopses posted to the list, as the
NUMA kernel is very different now that the slab allocator and scheduler
are NUMA-aware.
 $ fgrep 'def CONFIG_NUMA' mm/*.c kernel/*.c include/linux/* | wc -l
 58
 $ fgrep 'def CONFIG_SMP' mm/*.c kernel/*.c include/linux/* | wc -l
 81
