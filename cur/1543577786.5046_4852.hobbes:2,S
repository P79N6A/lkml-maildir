I stand corrected. Still, with almost-vanilla 2.2.18 (+ ow patches) on a
highly loaded webserver has not shown any "LRU block list corruption"
crashes in over 6 weeks, even when it usually died after a week on 2.2.17
with the same error (if memory serves me right). Could be the system tuning
that has "fixed" this by making the usual load not - err - load the server
as much as before.

Yep, as stated in my previous mail :-)
Ah well, time to go pack for military service (1 year, bleh).
Thanks.
