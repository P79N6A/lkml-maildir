Subject: kernel 2.6t9 SATA slower than 2.4.20

I have just compiled and installed kernel 2.6t9 on my RH9 / Asus A7N8X 
Deluxe.  I find the disk access is slower using the 2.6 kernel than the 
2.4.20 kernel.
To get it to work for 2.4.20 kernel I have to use
# hdparm -d1 -X88 /dev/hde
then the buffered disk read goes from 1.5M to 55M
On the 2.6 kernel the buffered disk read is only 16M
What do I have to do to increase the disk speed for kernel 2.6t9?
