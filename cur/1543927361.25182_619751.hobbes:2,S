Jan,
Thanks for taking time to review the patch :-)

Sure, good ideas, I will add these items to my benchmark list.

Thanks for the encouragement.
The first version was more than 2000 lines, including kernel and e2fsprogs patches. Finally I find
only around 100 lines kernel patch can achieve same performance too. Really nice :-)

Yes, if allocating a file inode, just return first inode offset in the reserved area of parent
directory. In this case, group is decided by find_group_other() or find_group_orlov(),
ext4_ino_from_ireserve() just tries to persuade linear inode allocator to search free inode slot
after parent's inode.

The only reason for me to use a goto, is 80 column limitation :) BTW, goto does not hurt performance
and readability here. IMHO, it's acceptable :-)

Today I finished V4 patch, which fixs  a bug and provides new mount option to configure reserved
inodes number. It can be faster on creating empty directories, I will release it once I finished
basic benchmark. Your advice on benchmark is valuable, I will post the benchmark result next week.
Best regards.
