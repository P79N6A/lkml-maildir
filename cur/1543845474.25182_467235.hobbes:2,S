I don't think that anyone is saying that what Tivo is doing isn't
wrong.  What is being said is that the license is the wrong place to
try to stop this sort of behaviour.  It is too broad a brush.
There are a number of different reasons for wanting to use
technological measures for stopping people from re-purposing a device
and they aren't necessarily all bad.  Do we want our code to be
prohibited from being used in all of these cases?  Some people think
not.
But I wonder if GPLv3 will really stop Tivo....
I just read it again and saw - at the end of section 1.
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
  regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
  Source. 
So if Tivo included the code they used to generate the key, then they
don't need to include the key itself :-)  Users can regenerate the key
form that program.  Not sure how long it will take though.
