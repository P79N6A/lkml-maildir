Hi,
I realize that I'm arriving just far too late on this thread to bring 
any meaning, so that's just for the info...
I have been using this interface for a _long_ time (before june 2005, cf 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=111869558800526&w=2) 
and for different things than power saving: I can turn off my (usb) 
optical mouse when watching a movie or going to bed.
Is there any hardware independent alternative to turn off USB devices?
See you,
Eric
