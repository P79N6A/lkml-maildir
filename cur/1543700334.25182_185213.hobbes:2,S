right. Ok I'm running now 2.6.0 with Nick's v28p1: The results without
load and with kernel compile load are attached. On nice level 0 I get
now the stuttering sound which I described in the previous mail. When I
renice gnomemeeting to -10 it's actually usable but not as good as in
2.4.2x. It's still sensitive to window movement and X activity. Two
subjective observations are that the nice levels haven't got such a big
impact in Nick's scheduler they used to have and that the default
behaviour gnomemeetingwise is better than in earlier Nick schedulers.

Tried it and doesn't make a difference.

AFAIK yes.

What's the railroad to me ?
I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows, 
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing.
                      (Henry David Thoreau)
