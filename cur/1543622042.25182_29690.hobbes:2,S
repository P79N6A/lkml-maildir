I got this problem also. Similar config, ATAPI Plextor CDRW using ide-scsi.
The system would refuse to read/mount CDs unless I did it as root. (eg,
cds wouldn't mount, cdparanoia wouldn't work) Upgrading to -rc2-ac1 seems
to have "fixed" it, have you tried -rc2? (I should try to figure out why
after class, when I actually have time :3 )
