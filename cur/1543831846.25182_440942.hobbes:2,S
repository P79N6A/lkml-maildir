It had better, that is exactly what the ACPI Global Lock is supposed to 
prevent (concurrent access to non-sharable resources between the OS and 
SMI code). The ACPI DSDT contains information on whether or not the 
machine requires the Global Lock in order to access the EC or whether it 
is safe to access without locking.
