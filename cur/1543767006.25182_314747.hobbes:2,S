Well, agreed that's great, but that seems to imply just generic sane
design: Why should the presence of another node (which does nothing, or
not with overlapping objects on disk) cause any substantial slowdown?
Admittedly we seem to be really short of meaningful benchmarks for DLMs
and/or clustering filesystems...
Hey. Wait. Benchmarks. Scalability issues. No real coding involved.
Anyone from OSDL listening?  ;-)

Perfect.

Yes, but this also would be a great time to identify real performance
bugs before shipping - so consider it as part of stress tesing ;-)

Understood.
