Not about the ones that have shown no sign of failing, no...
Most of the sites I have looked at have been cases where the kernel
genuinely doesn't care whether the device_create_file call succeeded
or failed.  Adding an if and printk in all these places seems like
pointless bloat when it could be done in one place - namely
device_create_file.  In one or two cases the return value from
device_create_file can be returned as its caller's return value, but
these were the minority.  In no cases that I have looked at was there
any other suitable action to take.

Greg claims that people ignore WARN_ON messages.  If that's true, I
fail to see how adding printks will help.
