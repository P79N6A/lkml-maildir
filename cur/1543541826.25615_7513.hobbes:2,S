	Oh my gosh!  I just used a modem connection for the first time in
a long time today and the connection was horrendously slow; ping time up
as high as 50 seconds round trip.  I just tried out the ecn disable and
Linux returned to normal.  Ping times average .7 seconds now, just about
right for a heavily used modem line.  Email and web pages actually arrive
in a reasonable amount of time again.
	2.4.0-pre7-test2, ppp-2.3.11 (sorry, perhaps 2.4.0 would have
fixed it - sheepish grin), unmaskirq on or off didn't affect the problem.
Plenty of memory, 56k external modem.  Backing down as low as 2.4.0-test4
didn't fix the networking problem.
	I'll gladly provide more details or test things if needed.
	Harley - thanks for the fix, even if it only masks the real
problem.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
