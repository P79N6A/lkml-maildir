It's 2.6.18-openvz-rhel5 kernel gives me 9MB/s, and with 2.6.27 I get ~40-50MB/s
instead of 80-90 MB/s as there should be no bottlenecks except the network.

Interesting, I'll try to change nfsd threads number and see how it performs
on my setup. Setting it to 1 seems like a good idea for cfq and a non-high-end
hardware.
I'll look into it this evening.
