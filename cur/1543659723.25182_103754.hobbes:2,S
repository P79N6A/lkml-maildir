OK....this definitely(well 99.5% chance) seems to be a problem that is 
in 2.4.21-pre3-ac4, but is not in 2.4.21-pre3, or in linus' bk tree. 
Also, this problem is not caused by the device-mapper patch which is the 
only reason I was trying the ac tree in the first place.
So, it's an ac specific problem separate from the device-mapper code:
Another (possibly related) hint is that at bootup, I get many(measured 
in the hundreds) reports of "ide: no cache flush required" which is in 
ide_cacheflush_p in drivers/ide/ide-disk.c, and is only present in the 
ac tree.
Does this seem like a likely culprit?
Hello...is this thing on...can anyone hear me? ;-)
