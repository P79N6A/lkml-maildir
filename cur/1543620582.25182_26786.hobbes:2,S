The problem is that (AFAIK) bk pull does not let Linus pick-and-choose
which patches he wants to accept as easily as importing them at the time
he reads each email.  It basically assumes that he wants everything that
is in the repository he is pulling from.

Yes, that would be my thought as well.  Sadly, running the command
bk send -d -r+ -wgzip_uu -
does not work as I would _hope_ it would, namely putting a regular context
diff at the beginning of the email, and gzip_uu for only the CSET.  That
would give us the best of both worlds, namely a diff to look at (which
most people can read easily), and the compressed CSET for people who
have BK.
I suppose it is possible to do exactly what I want by running both:
bk changes -r<rev>			# generates Changelog
bk export -tpatch -h -du -r<rev>	# generates context diff
bk send -wgzip_uu -r<rev> -		# generates gzipped/uuencoded CSET
This has the added benefit that 'bk export' does not contain changes to
the BK files themselves, only the real changes.
I have no idea if this would confuse BK if you tried to recieve from
a file which had both of these in it...

Oh, I agree that for people without BK they can keep sending patches.
I would prefer that people who _do_ have BK to send the CSET along with
the patch to the mailing list so that you don't have to go hunting for a
specific CSET, or if you can't because you are not currently connected.
This might also be possible if BK could export/import a whole changeset
in patch form, plus some magic stuff at the beginning/end (gzip_uu) which
had all of the BK metadata in it, but I don't know if that is possible or
desirable.
Cheers, Andreas
