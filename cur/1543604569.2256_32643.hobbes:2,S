But in "R" with your described behavior looks like a bug.
If you care about the CPU time waisted: what about kill -STOP <pid>?
Can you describe your filesystem layout?
I think of a symlink recursion bug or something wrong in /dev/shm
or alike... (no flame, just guessing :)
What are the parameters of "find"?
