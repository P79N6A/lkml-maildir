I'd like this to work as well. I have an E3500 currently with 4 100BaseT
(every board comes with one onboard, every non-onboard SCSI HBA I have
(besides fibre channel) has one as well, so why should I buy GigE cards and
switches?) but no GigE in house, the switch can do Fast EtherChannel but I
doubt Linux can be configured to use it. On that machine I'd be very happy
to test FTP throughput (in fact, it is an FTP server after all) if somebody
writes WAN simulating FTP clients.
Cheers,
