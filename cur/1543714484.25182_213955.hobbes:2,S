Sorry, I tested it all day; it just happens to work :)  Olof just 
pointed the error out to me, too.
I successfully allocated 152371 proc entries using this.
During testing I made sure that release_inode_number was actually 
releasing id's by inserting a call to idr_find before idr_remove, and 
using a dummy token for idr_get_new instead of NULL.  I can pass those 
bits along if you like.
BTW I found the use of idr in kernel/posix-timers.c to be more 
consistent with the comments in lib/idr.c so I emulated that.  I think 
the call to idr_remove in fs/super.c::set_anon_super needs to be holding 
unnamed_dev_lock.
Thanks,
Nathan
