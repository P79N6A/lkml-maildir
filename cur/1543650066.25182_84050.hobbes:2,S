Not that I would know better or have an idea why this bug happens, but to
say "Bugger off if you have an lfs system" is a bit lousy, I think. After
all, lfs has not really an "unstrusted toolchain", as compared to
RH/Suse's/Debian "trustworthy computing toolchains":
lfs has a manual with clearly specified package versions, patches and
order of "toolchaining". It might well be a bug in that chain, but other
distros have bugs, too. Signing software doesn't make it superior, after
all.
However, the error does not happen on my crappy lfs system, but then
again, I run it in a vmware, with the virtual disks set up as scsi...
