Ah ok. Well that shouldn't be a problem, IRDA could be added once there
are users for it. I am not sure if there are any devices with IRDA switches,
so it shouldn't be a big problem.

Well in drivers/net are the network drivers but not the irda and bluetooth drivers,
those are located in different folders in drivers/ so I think misc would be the most
suitable location.

Makes sense.

Yes, but what if the user loads both modules or has them both compiled in?
Shouldn't there be some protection against that, since both handlers should not
be active at the same time.

Then perhaps rfkill_register could call put_device() when it fails, and free()
can be removed entirely. That way it would we prevent some driver
to call free() anyway.

If I am not mistaken, Larry (CC'ed during most of this discussion) does have such
a device _and_ he knows more about the bcm43xx drivers. :)
Larry, if you have time, could you make a test run with the patches Dmitry has send?
