This _is_ and x86 system with HIGHMEM enabled.  The kernel is 2.4.13-pre3
and does _not_ have Jen's block highmem patches.
The hardware:
4 processors(700Mhz Xeon), 4GB ram
45 fibre channel drives, set up in hardware RAID 0/1
2 direct Gigabit Ethernet connections between SPEC SFS prime client and
system under test
reiserfs
all NFS filesystems exported with sync,no_wdelay to insure O_SYNC writes to
storage
NFS v3 UDP
