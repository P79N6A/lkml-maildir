Got it... Almost...
There was a confusion between
/etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules, the fact that bnx2 was in
the initrd image but not e1000.
So I edited /etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules to set the order
I wanted using directly the PCI ID as provided by the lspci -vvv:
[root@urpdev1 /etc]# lspci -vvv | grep Ethernet
05:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme II BCM5708
Gigabit Ethernet (rev 12)
09:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme II BCM5708
Gigabit Ethernet (rev 12)
0e:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82571EB Gigabit Ethernet
Controller (rev 06)
0e:00.1 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82571EB Gigabit Ethernet
Controller (rev 06)
[root@urpdev1 rules.d]# cat /etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules
# This file was automatically generated by the /lib/udev/write_net_rules
# program, probably run by the persistent-net-generator.rules rules
file.
#
# You can modify it, as long as you keep each rule on a single line.
# MAC addresses must be written in lowercase.
SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="?*", KERNELS=="0000:05:00.0", NAME="eth0"
SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="?*", KERNELS=="0000:09:00.0", NAME="eth1"
SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="?*", KERNELS=="0000:0e:00.0", NAME="eth2"
SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="?*", KERNELS=="0000:0e:00.1", NAME="eth3"
And recreated the initrd image after having set which module not to
forget... And it's order:
[root@urpdev1 /etc]# cat /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
# List of modules that you want to include in your initramfs.
#
# Syntax:  module_name [args ...]
#
# You must run update-initramfs(8) to effect this change.
#
# Examples:
#
# raid1
# sd_mod
bnx2
e1000
Here is the output of the dmesg with now the appropriate order:
[root@urpdev1 /etc]# dmesg | grep -i eth
[  120.685696] Broadcom NetXtreme II Gigabit Ethernet Driver bnx2
v1.5.8.1 (May 7, 2007)

[  270.832235] bnx2: eth0 NIC Link is Up, 1000 Mbps full duplex, receive

But still, there is a problem with the second Broadcom port (eth1):
[root@urpdev1 /etc]# mii-tool
eth0: negotiated 100baseTx-FD flow-control, link ok
SIOCGMIIPHY on 'eth1' failed: Resource temporarily unavailable
eth2: negotiated 100baseTx-FD flow-control, link ok
eth3: negotiated 100baseTx-FD flow-control, link ok
I don't get it?
Help appreciated.
