    This is cute. Could you ask your friend what a multi-threaded
    TCP/IP stack is?
His friend probably refers to the locking used by the stack and how
much concurrency you'll get with multiple processors.
With 2.2.x most of the stack is under a single lock, with 2.4.x
locking will be such that multiple processors can be in the stack at
the same time (the performance should be much greater then under high
load on big SMP boxes).
