As 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_Man
 phrases it,
"A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on
misrepresentation of an opponent's position ... the
opponent's actual argument has not been refuted."
That's clearly what you've been doing by proposing some
specific -- and obviously bad -- user interfaces, none
of which have the fundamental characteristic I described.

Which is why my comment was about something else entirely!
That is, having an out-of-kernel database which could preclude
the need for such requestors for devices already known.

A new straw man!  Because power management isn't the relevant point.
All they'd ever have to understand is:  is it working correctly right
now?  That's after an experimental autosuspend, and after poking the
hardware to verify that, from the kernel perspective, it acts OK.
Oliver pointed out that the typical failure mode is easily detected
in software.  So when the user says "OK, I'll help set it up", the
worst case would be that the device is NOT recorded already in that
database, the user might need to be ready to unplug then replug the
device (when that experiment fails).

That's shortly after the explanation that the relevant Kconfig
option is for  ** /proc/bus/usb ** files ... note that despite the
strangeness in that text (usbfs still hasn't been "replaced", so
that should say "will eventually be replaced" not "is replaced"),
it's clear that /proc/bus/usb/ and /dev/bus/usb/ are two different
things.  And thus:  that Ubuntu's /dev/bus/usb/ setup is flakey.

There's no option there to affect what happens when it's running
on battery power.  Though I'm curious what it means when it has
a "suspend" option (not "hibernate") ... I wouldn't mind STR.

That side of things has been absent from the discussion so far.
When something is wrongly blacklisted (by whatever), how are you
proposing that it get un-blacklisted?  Seems to me that whatever
mechanism resolves that issue should also work the other way around...
