what makes you think it should have been? you probably didn't even look,
there're so many problems with ssp here and in general.
1. despite the nice analysis in LWN, it unfortunately stopped half way where
   Jon declared that:
     And this turns the failure to read-verify the source array into a buffer
     overflow vulnerability within the kernel. Once that is in place, it is a
     relatively straightforward exercise for any suitably 31337 hacker to
     cause the kernel to jump into the code of his or her choice. Game over. 
   fact of the matter is, it's far from game over at this point. and that's
   because despite all appearances, this is far from your run-of-the-mill
   stack buffer overflow. in particular, the overflow does *not* rely on
   overwriting any saved return address on the stack.
   the trickery with the fake compound page set up should have been a sign
   that something else is going on here and the lesson ain't over until you
   understand that part as well.
2. so why isn't this exploit about an overflowed return address? because
   before any potentially overflowed return address would be dereferenced,
   the kernel will attempt to release the page refcounts it acquired in
   get_user_pages (check splice_to_pipe, called from vmsplice_to_pipe
   where the overflowed buffer is). normally that wouldn't be a problem
   since even though the pages[PIPE_BUFFERS] array was overflowed, it was
   overflowed with valid struct page pointers, so releasing them should
   be fine. except there's a trick in the exploit that will cause a userland
   controlled struct page pointer to be released as well at which point
   the exploit takes matters into its own hands:
   previous to calling vmsplice, the exploit has prepared a specially
   constructed struct page array to fake a compound page. the point in
   using a compound page is that such a page has a destructor (read:
   function pointer) which is now under the direct control of the exploit
   and will result in ring-0 code execution of exploit code. *this* is
   the point where it becomes a trivial exercise to escalate privileges.
3. what's ssp got to do with all this? Arjan would have you believe that
   it would have caught this exploit in action, preventing the privilege
   escalation. nothing could be further from the truth though.
   for one if ssp were to kick into action, it could at most be at the
   time vmsplice_to_pipe returns. except it doesn't as explained above.
   but imagine for a second that vmsplice_to_pipe does return. would ssp
   detect anything? at least gentoo's gcc 4.2.2 doesn't at all instrument
   vmsplice_to_pipe with -fstack-protector, so no dice.
   let's go further and imagine we enable CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_ALL
   (which in turn makes gcc use -fstack-protector-all). this will now
   properly instrument vmsplice_to_pipe. problem is, such a kernel doesn't
   boot. probably noone has ever tried it (why does it have a config option?).
   the fix isn't trivial and possibly incomplete, see the patches at the end.
   finally just imagine that ssp somehow caught this or another exploit in
   action. what will we learn about it? nothing. that's right, due to bad
   decisions made by certain developers (both gcc and kernel),__stack_chk_fail
   doesn't get passed any extra info (unlike Etoh's original ssp), nor does
   the kernel's version produce any actually useful output that, pray tell,
   could help identify the attacked function. instead it just panic's. a truly
   useful experience.
   it also bears a note here that the way ssp is currently implemented in
   the kernel is quite useless, a per-task static cookie is trivial to learn
   in a kernel info-leak exploit that in turn can be built into the actual
   attack payload to bypass any detection (a case that ssp was designed to
   protect against, this particular bug/exploit doesn't give direct control
   over the overflow content, hence even the current cookie method would have
   been fine, were it not irrelevant for reasons explained above).
[...]

sadly for all those users living in a false sense of security, this has
never been true. but long live cargo cult security.

patches to get CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_ALL actually to work (it includes
the Makefile patch proposed in this thread already).
note that the fix to ACPI is an actual stack corruption bug (caught by ssp
thanks to a lucky stack layout), due to the misuse of the pci accessor
functions, probably a whole-tree audit is in order for similar bugs.
note also that the vsyscall functions (more precisely, all the code that
goes into .vsyscall* sections) had better be separated into their own .c
files so that they can be compiled without -mcmodel=kernel and use %fs for
getting the ssp cookie, if ssp is desired at all there).
