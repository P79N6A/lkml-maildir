Subject: [PATCH] checkpatch: Print filenames of patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/18/10

checkpatch: Print filenames of patches instead of the very uninformative
`Your patch'.
Signed-off-by: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert@linux-m68k.org>

This patch is not `checkpatch' clean :-)
Although I shortened 2 lines, they're still longer than 80 characters...

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
