And more importantly, supports PnP. My best guess at this point is
that your BIOS might be configuring the card. All the configuration of
the Tropez is really done by the cs4232 module, except that if it
finds the device already configured, it doesn't do anything. So, if
the BIOS sticks its head in the door and sets up the Tropez, the
cs4232 module won't do anything, and regardless of what you have in
conf.modules, the card is going to end up configured the way the BIOS
wants it to be (e.g. IRQ 15, not IRQ 9).
On my new machine, I disabled BIOS PnP support for precisely this
reason. I don't want to have to use the BIOS for device
configuration. I run Linux, not the Award WinBIOS, and I want to do my
configuration from Linux.
