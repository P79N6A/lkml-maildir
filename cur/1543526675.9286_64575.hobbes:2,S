   At some moment between 2.3.40 and 2.3.45 something changed in the
   IP logic apparently.  My system is Glibc2 based, it is non-networked
   most of the time, so I do not run network-related daemons like
   portmapper.  When I first booted 2.3.45, I noticed that all operations
   that require resolver slowed to a crawl.  I did investigation and
   found that glibc resolver, among other things, is trying to query
   the portmapper at localhost.
Turn off NIS and non-file hostname lookups in /etc/nsswitch.conf
