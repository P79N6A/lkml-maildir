You are absolutely right.  I could have sworn i did a make mrproper && cp
/tmp/config .config && make oldconfig, but I may have missed the oldconfig
part. :/ I feel like such a n00b all of a sudden.  At any rate, thanks
sooo much for taking the time to troubleshoot this for me.  I managed to
build it finally, after meticulously doing the make mrproper and make
oldconfig as you reminded me I should..... :)
Thanks!
