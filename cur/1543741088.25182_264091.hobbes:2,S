These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness with
specific emphasis on the desktop, but configurable to any workload.

Split patches and a server specific patch available.
Added:
  +mwII-oc.diff
Linking hardmaplimit to overcommit is no longer required as hardmaplimit
is not set by default, and there was a compile problem with modules.
This backs it out.
  +back-sched-net-fix-scheduling-latencies-in-__release_sock.patch
Something about this patch from the low latency hacks in combination
with -ck causes a panic on nmap with some hardware (only on -ck). Remove
it for now.
  +ll-config1.diff
Change the default low latency config options to have the debug off by
default.
  +fix-bad-segment-coalescing-in-blk_recalc_rq_segments.patch
A bugfix for i/o scheduler which improves performance under heavy i/o load.
  +vm-pages_scanned-active_list.patch
A nasty bug that caused kswapd to get stuck consuming heaps of cpu which
was in mainline 2.6.9 was tracked down by some of my users (thanks!) and
fixed by Nick Piggin (thanks!).
  +269ck2-version.diff
