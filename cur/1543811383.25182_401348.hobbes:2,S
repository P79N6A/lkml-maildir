I think this might be <
http://gcc.gnu.org/PR5035>.
It's in the nature of this warning that improving its accuracy is often,
to quote rth in that bug, `distinctly non-trivial'. The (numerous) new
SSA optimizers in GCC 4.1 may well have fixed it: I'd be surprised if
they hadn't zapped a heap of FPs. I doubt it'll ever improve in 4.0.x,
because the magnitude of the changes required to do so is just so large.
There is ongoing argument on the GCC list between two camps: one that
proposes moving such warnings into the frontend, and says that the
increase in FPs is worth it given the increase in warning stability (the
warnings don't go away just because you change optimization level); the
other argues against this on the basis that a warning that gives lots
of FPs is mostly useless.
Feel free to chip in the next time this argument flares up :)
