I've always been able to get it back to dma for packet by forcing the
drive to sleep mode and then letting the kernel wake it.   I guess I'll
try this 3rd version patch when I get back from class today and see if
that still works.   
hdparm -Y /dev/cdrom    
then go and set dma again with hdparm.   
Although this could just be fickleness of my cdrom.
