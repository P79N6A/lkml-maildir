I would like to start off by thanking everybody for their help with my last 
question,  Much appreciated.
I am currently testing kernel 2.6.0-test3, specifically the initramfs feature, 
under VMWare
Upon booting I get the following:
Dentry cache hash table entries: 16384 (order: 4, 65536 bytes)
Inode-cache hash table entries: 8196 (order: 3, 32768 bytes)
Mount-cache hash table entries: 512 (order: 0, 4096 bytes)
->(three characters, an 'o' with an I superimposed, a carat^, and a white 
smilyface)
Kernel panic: populate_root: bogus mode: 0
In idle task - not syncing
===Creation details - verbose===
I have created a directory tree on my system that I would like to use as a 
root fs.  I then created (from the root of that structure) the cpio archive 
by using
find | cpio -ov > ../filesystem.cpio
cd ..
gzip -9 filesystem.cpio
I then copied the file into the proper location in the source tree, compiled 
and had everything boot nicely.
I used syslinux to boot the kernel from a disk (only way I could get it to 
work on the virtual disk image to boot under VMWare)
===End of Creation details===
How would you suggest I go about fixing this problem, or do you require more 
information?  Also, is there a good detailed FAQ or a HOWTO document available 
online that I might be able to refer to?
Once again, thank you for your assistance.
