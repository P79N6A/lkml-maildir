The funny blinking characters are an fbcon bug. I would have to dive
deeper into the fbcon code to fully understand what's up... afaik,
it's supposed to "translate" the content of your VGA text buffer when
taking over, and that isn't working properly. As soon as I get an
x86 with a radeon for testing here, I'll be able to work on that.
