You misunderstand. I don't mean the performance cost is high, I mean the
cost of an application to actually be able to run without open() (what I
was saying before, static built, no glibc, no conf files, no name
lookups, etc). I never see this being used in the real world because of
the extreme limitations.
And that is just practical stuff, there are still problems with
embedding policy into binaries all over the system in an entirely
non-analyzable way, and this extends to all capabilities, not just the
open() one.
