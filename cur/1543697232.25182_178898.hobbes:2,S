I was (obviously?) assuming that the bk(d) was the commercial version, but I 
don't see how that would affect the client from being o/s?
And why is this different from bk2cvs? Because then I have to rsync the cvs 
repo with all the problems (discussed at length in this thread) of getting a 
coherent local copy of the repo.
I guess it all comes back to my wanting to host my (commercial and open-
source) public code repositories with bk, but have to guarantee 100% access 
to my 'users'. 99% Isn't good enough.
I'm not, Daniel, a FSF/GPL whiner, and do not appreciate being labelled as 
such.
