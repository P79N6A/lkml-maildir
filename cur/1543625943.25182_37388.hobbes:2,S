either locks up the system or gets killed

No idea.

Mine works with 4.2.0's DRI, with latest
DRI from dri.sourceforge.net and with an
alternative drivers from gatos.sourceforge.net.
They all locks my system probably due to
an AMD Irongate.

I was also confused by the fact that 7500
support doesn't exist in 4.1.0, but 4.2.0
really supports it.
Anyway, visit gatos.sourceforge.net and try
the drivers from there.
