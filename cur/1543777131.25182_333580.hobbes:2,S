I used your versions of the patches (Tom's ucm one is needed and you
added that). I also back ported the trailing whitespace elimination
changes.
I just completed a regression test including uCM, CM, RMPP, OpenSM,
IPoIB and it looks good to me.
I'll check this again when the next -mm comes out.
Thanks.
