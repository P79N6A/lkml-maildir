You should definitely enable TCP in this case.
Most likely causes: you may have a problem with echos on your wireless,
or you may have a faulty driver for your NIC.
Try looking at 'netstat -s' on both the server and the client. Monitor
the number of TCP segments sent out, number retransmitted, and number of
segments received on both ends of the connection while doing a set of
writes, then do the same for a set of reads.
Also try monitoring the wireless rates (iwlist <interface> rate), and
quality of link (iwlist <interface> ap) while this is going on. Note: if
your driver doesn't support iwlist, then just typing 'iwconfig
<interface>' might also give you these numbers.
Cheers,
  Trond
