Can you help me with an SHM related problem?
I'm currently writing a Win32 emulation kernel module to help speed Wine up,
and I'm writing the file mapping support stuff at the moment
(CreateFileMapping and MapViewOfFile).
I have PE Image mapping just about working (fixups, misaligned file sections
and all), but I'm trying to think of a good way of doing anonymous shared
mappings without having to hack the main kernel around too much (so far I've
only had to add to kernel/ksyms.c).
Is there a reasonable way I could hook into the SHM system to "reserve" a
chunk of shared memory of a particular size, and then a second hook by which I
can "map" _part_ of that into a process's address space?
Cheers,
David
PS: to anyone else reading this, if you wrote do_generic_file_read(), it
rocks!
