You can use ibm-acpi to properly track your thinkpad thermal sensors, load
it with the "experimental=1" parameter, and look at what gets exported at
/proc/acpi/ibm/thermal.
You can also use /proc/acpi/ibm/fan to check the fan's state.  And use the
"level 7" /proc/acpi/ibm/fan command to set the emergency cooling level, and
"level disengaged" command to set the really badass fan cooling level (might
damage your hardware, we don't know if it is safe and IBM/Lenovo isn't
talking).
