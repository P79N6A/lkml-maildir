I don't know if it's BS or not, you clearly fixed your own problem which
is good .. Although when you say "RT patches cannot achieve what I
needed. Even RTAI/Xenomai can't do that." , and HRT is "Not accurate
enough and way too much overhead" .. Given the hardware your using,
that's all difficult to believe.. You also said this code has been
running on production systems for two year, which means it's at least
two years old .. There's been some good sized leaps in real time linux
in the past two years ..
