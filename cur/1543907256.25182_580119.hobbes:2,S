Yeah, although the Blackfin on-chip SPI driver is originally developed
by Luke Yang, currently it is maintained by me. Sorry for this missing,
I will send driver update patches
to related subsystem maintainers in LKML.

Actually, I wanna to obey the merge window policy, but there are some
many changes in my local tree related to GPIO, silicon anomaly (common
fixing). So I choose GPIO changes in this git-pull, thanks for your
understanding situation.
I will remove the SPI driver patch from this GIT-PULL, a new GIT-PULL
will be requested. 
(Frankly speaking, I am afraid of being added to Linus's shit-list for
the next few releases, -:(( ).
Thanks a lot, Mike and David.
