I'll answer my own question here (a novel idea...) yes, they work just
great...helps if the PCI slots on the motherboard they are plugged
into are also functional....they weren't then again neither was the
Floppy Controller as I found out...so much for NEW hardware....got a
new board here (with working slots and FDC) and all is well.
