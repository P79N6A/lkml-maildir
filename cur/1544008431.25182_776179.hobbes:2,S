I am wondering what I said that leads to that conclusion :-) If parent
has a handler the handler will be called as usual otherwise SIGCHLD
will be ignored.
But anyway, an earlier version of my patches checked the pid namespace
sooner and so I had to generalize task_active_pid_ns().
With the present order of checks in siginfo_from_ancestor_ns(), we don't
need to generalize task_active_pid_ns(). SIG_FROM_USER flag will be clear
when do_notify_parent() calls send_signal().
IOW, while we should eventually generalize task_active_pid_ns(), it is
not required for this signals patchset and we can ignore patches 1 and 2
for now.

Yes. Are you suggesting a check like
	if (!is_si_special(info) && !SI_FROMKERNEL(info)) ?
		/* must be from user, safe to check ns */
But SI_ASYNCIO comes from the driver - so its not safe to check pid ns.
(sent a separate query on SI_ASYNCIO).

| Why? Even now it may be used on zombie tasks.
It used to be unsafe, and iirc was fixed a while ago(in part by moving
exit_task_namespaces() into exit_notify()).
Are you saying there is another path (outside these signals patches) where
task_active_pid_ns() is called for zombies ?
