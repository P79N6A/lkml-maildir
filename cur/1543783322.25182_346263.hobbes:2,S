My general idea about future Cell based products is that we make the
changes to the platform code at the time we add new code. Of course,
a number of companies are working on designs that I have no insight in,
so I'll just wait what comes, but at least I've tried to make it
easy to add the stuff that I know about.

Yes, this one is a bit odd. On the one hand, it is very generic and could
be used for any future open firmware or flat device tree based system
(even non-PowerPC). On the other hand, it works only on one particular
board design currently.
I don't really care about where this is put, ranging from:
arch/{ppc64,powerpc}/kernel/of_nvram.c, meaning that everyone using the
	flat device tree can just add an "nvram" node that will work with
	this driver.
arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/cellblade_nvram.c, to keep it specific to
	the one design that we have, assuming that future Cell based
	designs will use something else.
