So invent some /dev/syscall/<syscall-device-name> and you've reduced
this to good old clashes in a flat name space. You can hide all the
ugliness, sanity checking, etc. in a library.
I also think that a more direct approach for dynamic syscalls would
be nice, but the current status quo is far from unbearable.
