We need to ensure that we're also creating a maintainable kernel.  RDMA doesn't
use sockets, but that doesn't mean it's not part of the networking support
provided by the Linux kernel.  Making blanket statements that RDMA should stay
within a sandbox is equivalent to saying that RDMA should duplicate any network
related functionality that it might need.

I agree that using a socket is the wrong approach, but my guess is that it was
suggested as a possibility because of the attempt to keep RDMA in its 'sandbox'.
The iWarp architecture implements RDMA over TCP; it just doesn't use sockets.
The Linux network stack doesn't easily support this possibility.  Are there any
reasonable ways to enable this to the degree necessary for iWarp?
