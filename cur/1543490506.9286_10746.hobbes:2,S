Hello module gurus,
I have been having problems including the SCSI module, scsi_mod.o,
into a boot RAM disk image.
As advised, I used the --preload keyword to Red Hat's mkinitrd to load
the scsi_mod module first.
The machine booted fine. However, the (unrelated) floppy disk would
not work anymore!
`od /dev/fd0` produces these log entries, unstoppable, and ultimately
fatal.

There does not seem to be any evidence that an interrupt is being
used for the floppy. I know that there is one being used and I
know the only one that could be used because it is hardwired (IRQ6).
However, it doesn't show anywhere.

Also, the I/O range used by the floppy 0x3f0-0x3f7, is not shown either.

If these are now dynamic (like serial I/O), and allocated only when the
floppy is opened, I don't know why. A floppy controller will never be
hot-swappable. This sure makes debugging difficult.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
