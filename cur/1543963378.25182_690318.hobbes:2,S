There is one case that seems to the source of Hans' problem, as Dave has
figured out: /proc/pid/pagemap, where we fairly straight-forwardly walk
the pagetables.
In there, we unconditionally call pmd_none_or_clear_bad(pmd). And any
userspace process that maps hugepages and then reads in
/proc/pid/pagemap will invoke that path, I think (at least with 2M
pages).
So I agree, you're fixing a potential issue in follow_page() [might
deserve a comment, so someone doesn't go and combine them back later?],
but Hans' issue is most likely related to the pagemap code?
Thanks,
Nish
