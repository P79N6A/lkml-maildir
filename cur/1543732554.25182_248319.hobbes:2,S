Right. I had tried this before. The gcc-call works just fine, anyway 
boot.o is truncated.

Both say: File truncated

Yes, still bad.
I now tried compiling with gcc-3.4 (3.4.1 (Debian 3.4.1-4sarge1)), that 
works fine.
I am just compiling 2.6.8 with gcc-3.4. This fails at:
mm/fremap.o: file not recognized: File truncated
Any ideas?
