In fact, it already does for NFS, which uses PageLocked for exactly that
reason (to serialize read and write requests to the same page).

For "valid to read", you only check Uptodate.  For any actual IO
(whether it's because you're going to actually _do_ the read or set up
some write), PageLocked should be used to synchronize.  NFS already does
this, and generic_file_read() already understands about it.
