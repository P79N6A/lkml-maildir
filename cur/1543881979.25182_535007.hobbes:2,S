Yeah, that's because Dan's dev_dbg-check-dev_dbg-arguments.patch added
printk arg-checking to dev_dbg() and a bunch of bugs got exposed.  I fixed
a few of them.
Incidentally, there are at least four different drivers which privately do
things like:
#if !defined(DEBUG)
#undef dev_dbg
static inline int __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3))) dev_dbg(
	const struct device *_dev, const char *fmt, ...) {return 0;}
#endif
which can all be removed with Dan's (good) patch in place.
