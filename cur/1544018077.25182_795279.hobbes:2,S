And to make matters worse, this completely changes the underlying
semantics for systems that _require_ exclusive use of the per-device
region and don't permit fallback to the generic allocator. Returning 0
from dma_alloc_from_coherent() indicates that the generic allocator is
safe to fall back on, which is totally bogus in the DMA_MEMORY_EXCLUSIVE
case. This is what causes 8139too to successfully allocate memory on the
Dreamcast from totally bogus locations, which causes the generally
unhelpful error messages. If the fallback hadn't been made silently, it
would have errored out on allocating the buffers immediately.
So, something like the following should do it:
