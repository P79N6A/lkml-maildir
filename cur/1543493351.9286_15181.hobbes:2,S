I've got machine which has two identical IBM 16 GB disks. Funny thing
is that linux seems to think that their geometry is different.
Here is output from boot messages:
hda: IBM-DTTA-351010, 9671MB w/466kB Cache, CHS=1232/255/63, UDMA
hdb: IBM-DTTA-351680, 16124MB w/462kB Cache, CHS=2055/255/63, UDMA
hdc: IBM-DTTA-351680, 16124MB w/462kB Cache, CHS=32760/16/63, UDMA
Both disks have identical settings in BIOS. Motherboard is Abit BX6 v2.0
which is BX-based. This doesn't seem to cause any trouble but does anyone
have idea why this happens?. BTW kernel is 2.2.6.
