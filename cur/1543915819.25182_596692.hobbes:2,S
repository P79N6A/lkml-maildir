Instead of letting gcc use whatever instruction it sees fit best
for accessing the variable (like add/cmp/test...)
now we force it to use mov imm,reg first. Maybe with preceding nop
due to "align 2".
And then we use 12 more bytes in __immediate section
*for each* place where you read the variable.
Do you plan to use the same approach on x86_64?
I mean, longs there are twice as long.
Can this be made conditional, on CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE perhaps?
