The Red Hat-approved licences don't include LGPL either.
Red Hat's definition of "Open Source/Free Software" ("means any software
which is licensed under an Approved License.") could do with some
clarification.
I wonder what their stance is if I dual license under BSD and GPL.  Do I
have to be explicit about it?  Or is that too loose - must it be GPL only?
I wonder if that means I have to explicitly list my high performance web
server, which takes advantage of the patented directory lookup of
course, as dual licensed under GPL and LGPL, or if that is taken as
implied.
etc.
