`patch-gcc4-fixes-v15-2.4.33-rc1' contains all required core patches,
and all patches for the drivers etc I use. I don't need any other
patch on any of my i386/x86-64/ppc32 machines.
`patch-more-gcc4-fixes' contains compile-time fixes for all drivers etc
I was able to select when doing the initial gcc-4.0 work, except for
those drivers I actually use (they are in the core patch set). I can't
test these drivers, but I keep the patches around just in case they ever
become useful.
