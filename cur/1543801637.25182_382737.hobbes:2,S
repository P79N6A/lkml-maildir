variable size runtime cpu count.. that's beside the point for this
change though. The *default* shouldn't be insanely high, but more
represent a "typical" setup. The *maximum* is of course an entirely
different thing. So.. I'd say lower the default from 512 to 128 (just to
get the default to be the "complex case", which has benefits). Going to
1024 for a per user default is silly. Just about everyone will change it
anyway to something lower. And distros set their own regardless.
