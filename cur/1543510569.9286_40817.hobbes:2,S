I get this from the Symbios 53c8xx driver in 2.3.18ac8
    sym53c875E-0: PCI clock seems too high (37662 KHz).
The bus speed *is* correct as the motherboard is overclocked - I know
not everyone approves and I'm prepared to take the consequenses.
However, if the check was not specifically intended to prevent the
driver working on overclocked boards could I suggest changing the
comparison from 37Mhz to 42Mhz.
