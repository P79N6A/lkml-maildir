On my config (Logitech wireless mouse and kb with USB receiver) :
- 272 keycode happens on each left click,
- 273 or 276 on each right click (actual button pressed dependant there 
are 2 buttons recognised as the right one on my Optical Trackman),
- 275 on each middle click,
- 274 on each wheel click...
Hope it helps.
