I don't buy that explanation. Reason is simple: during this all network
connections work flawlessly, and they do have quite a lot of interrupts
compared to ISDN. ISDN is so slow and has so few interrupts that it is quite
unlikely in a SMP-beyond-GHz-limit box that you loose some. The ancient
hardware days are long gone ...
