here's a *really* rough first pass, i'm sure the end result would need
some hand tweaking:
=============================================
#!/bin/sh
DIR=$1
#
#  Put in missing parentheses.
#
for f in $(grep -Erl "sizeof [^\(]" ${DIR}) ; do
  echo $f
  perl -pi -e "s/sizeof ([*]?[A-Za-z0-9_>\[\]\.-]+)( *)/sizeof\(\1\)\2/g" $f
done
#
#  Delete possible space between "sizeof" and "(".
#
for f in $(grep -rl "sizeof (" ${DIR}) ; do
  perl -pi -e "s/sizeof \(/sizeof\(/g" $f
done
#
#  Delete obnoxious spaces inside parentheses.
#
for f in $(grep -rl "sizeof( " ${DIR}) ; do
  perl -pi -e "s/sizeof\( *([^ \)]+) *\)/sizeof\(\1\)/g" $f
done
===========================================
