Well, I for one have been running
hdparm -t /dev/md0
or
time head -c 1000m /dev/md0 > /dev/null
while /dev/md0 was mounted without realizing that this could be "stupid" or
that it could eat my data.
/dev/md0 on /backup-versioned type ext2 (rw)
I often cat(1) or head(1) partitions or devices (even mounted ones) if I
need dummy randomish test data for compression or tape drives (that I've
been having trouble with). 
BTW: is 2.2 affected? 2.0?
