Mutt with IMAP is rather bearable even on a GPRS connection (40kbps,
1sec latency). On a 100baseTX it's not distinguishable from local
operation.
One thing missing in mutt is a persistent message and message header
cache - opening a folder can take a lot of time over a slow connection.
But there is a patch at least for the message header cache persistence
floating on the 'net somewhere.
Another thing that bugs me often in mutt is its inability to service
keystrokes while doing something else (like checking for new mail over
IMAP with a slow link). It becomes unresponsive until that task is done.
