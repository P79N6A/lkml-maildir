OK, folks - new version is on the ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/smp-patch-14.gz
News:
*	big lock is taken inside the fput(). fput() can be called without
	the big lock and the common path will not touch the big lock at all.
*	some big lock shifting. Please, look through mm/* part. do_mmap()
	still needs the big lock - there is an unrelated race waiting.
	Interaction with mandatory locks, that is.
*	races (present in 2.2.10 and 2.3.9-pre4) fixed on irix and
	(partially) on sparc. I'll extract that part and will submit it to
	Linus - races are *not* SMP-specific.
I think that this variant may be visibly faster. Large parts of mm/* are
taken out of the big lock. I think that file descriptors handling and
struct file handling are mostly OK now. Remaining problems sit in
arch/sparc64/solaris/timod.c and it seems to be full of races that have
nothing with SMP. Plus there are several places where we will need a
cosmetical changes for big file array support (kmod.c).
It may be buggy. It didn't get sufficient testing. It may screw your
disks, eat your filesystems, create accounts for Zumabot and C&S *and*
start posting - you've been warned. Said that, bug reports and comments 
are more than welcome.
The next goal became obvious - fs/locks.c. We have a *big* contention
point there and it really doesn't scale well. Deadlock detection is nasty
- look what it does in posix_locks_deadlock(). Notice *multiple* scans of
the system-wide locks list. Essentially the current version does the
following:
next_task:
	if (caller == blocker)
		fail
	for fl in all active locks
		for bfl in all locks blocked by fl
			if bfl is owned by blocker
				if fl is owned by caller
					fail
				blocker = owner of fl
				goto next_task
From the reading of fs/locks.c it seems that keeping the list of *blocked*
locks with given owner would simplify the thing big way.
So there...
