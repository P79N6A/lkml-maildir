That's pretty much what I was assuming without knowing how the kernel 
internally really works.

Right, that's why I don't really need read locking. The 
double-writing/reading with memcmp() checking was supposed to check 
that the data is valid.
I'm already using shared mmaps, but I was thinking that supporting NFS 
would be nice as well. That'd work pretty much the same as write()s.
Maybe it would be possible to use some kind of error detection 
checksums which would guarantee that the data either is valid or isn't, 
regardless of the order in which it is written. I don't really know how 
that could be done though.
