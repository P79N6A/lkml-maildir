Your Netscape was either linked against a library you don't have, is
an a.out binary with no "a.out" support in the kernel, or is an ELF
executable with no "ELF" support in the kernel. Strace can start because
the executable can't start. Such problems with copying executables
between machines can be fixed by linking it --static on the machine
you copied it from, then copying it.
