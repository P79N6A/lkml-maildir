NAK.  Xen doesn't depend on PCI at all.   Why not make VSMP depend on 
PCI?  Then you could put something like:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_VSMP
extern void vsmp_init(void);
extern int is_vsmp_box(void);
#else
static inline void vsmp_init(void)
{
}
static inline int is_vsmp_box(void)
{
	return 0;
}
#endif
in an appropriate header.
Hm, looks like arch/x86/kernel/Makefile should be
obj-$(CONFIG_X86_VSMP)		+= vsmp_64.o
rather than making it depend directly on CONFIG_PARAVIRT.
