Subject: make xconfig fails for older kernels

I have downloaded 2.6.0 + patches up to 2.6.13 from kernel.org.
When I try to configure the kernel using 'make xconfig' I get the following 
error:
scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:91: error: static declaration of ‘current_menu’ 
follows non-static declaration
scripts/kconfig/lkc.h:63: error: previous declaration of ‘current_menu’ was 
here
make[1]: *** [scripts/kconfig/mconf.o] Error 1
make: *** [xconfig] Error 2
I attempted make menuconfig, make config, and make oldconfig but each failed 
with the same error,
This happens on 2.6.0, 2.6.1, 2.6.2 2.6.3, 2.6.4.
I have previously built newer kernels such as 2.6.13-rc2-rt7 without a 
problem.
I was able to overcome the error by commenting out the declaration of 
current_menu in mconf.c. But I am concerned as to the cause of this problem.
Does anyone have an explanation?
thanks,
Felix
