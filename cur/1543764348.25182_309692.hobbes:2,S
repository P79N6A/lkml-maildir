I'm currently running with the buffer-trace debug patch, on 2.4, with a
custom patch to put every buffer jbd ever sees onto a per-superblock
list, and remove it only when the bh is destroyed in
put_unused_buffer_head().  At unmount time, we can walk that list to
find stale buffers attached to data pages (invalidate_buffers() already
does such a walk for metadata.)
I just ran it with a quick test and it found 300,000 buffers still
present at unmount.  Whoops, I guess I need to move the check to _after_
the final invalidate_inodes() call. :-)
But this method ought to allow us to test for this sort of leak a lot
more reliably, and to report via the usual buffer history tracing the
most recent activity on any bh that does leak.
Andrew, I'll give this a try on 2.6 once I've got this 2.4 patch tested
for Marcelo.  I've got uptodate buffer_trace for 2.6 anyway, so it
shouldn't be too hard.
