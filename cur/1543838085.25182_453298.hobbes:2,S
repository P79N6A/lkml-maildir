We would benefit from having some faul-injection capabilities in the
mainline kernel.
- kmalloc failures
- alloc_pages() failures
- disk IO errors (there are rumours of a DM module for this, but I
  haven't seen it).
They would need to be lightweight, clean and enabled/configured at runtime,
not at boot time.
This would end up being a fairly complex project.
