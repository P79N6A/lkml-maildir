Subject: 2.6.0 - Suspend to disk (pmdisk) resets when resume

Hello,
suspend to disk is not working (resume part) on my laptop. I did some debugging
and I've found following:
suspend part seems to be ok
resume part seems to be ok if I was not running X server
resume part hardly resets my laptop if I was running X server
reset is performed in arch/i386/power/pmdisk.S during copying pages back to
memory. 
if I do printk each destination pointer it resets on address 0xc03ee00 that is
an address to kernel space around console and framebuffer code.
following is with X server running:
if I force to copy only first 1869 pages then it does not reset.
if I force to copy only from page 1950 to the last then it does not reset.
if I force to copy each page except a range 1869-1950 then it resets.
if I force to not copy any reserved page than it hangs after resume but does not
reset.
page 1869 is far behind the kernel code.
I wonder how could kernel reset only after some pages are copied :(
I have intel graphic card i852 integrated with shared memory.
