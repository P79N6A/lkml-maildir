Christoph was forced to put the invalidate_range callback _after_
dropping the PT lock because xpmem has to wait I/O there. But
invalidate_range is called after freeing the VM reference on the pages
so then GRU needed a _range_begin too because GRU has to flush the tlb
before the VM reference on the page is released (xpmem and KVM pin the
pages mapped by the secondary mmu, GRU doesn't). So then
invalidate_range was renamed to invalidate_range_end.
