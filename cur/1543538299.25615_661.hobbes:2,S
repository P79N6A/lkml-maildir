Subject: Someone with full mailbox, bouncing messages..
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've been receiving messages lately from someone's mailer daemon
stating that a particular user has a full mailbox, so the
delivery couldn't be made.
The email address is:  srao@globalnoise.com
Since I've never to my knowledge posted anything to this person,
it MUST be bouncing from a mailing list that I am on, and to
which I post to.  I've CC'd this message to several lists, so
that with any luck, the list maintainer will spare us all a bunch
of junkmail full mailbox notices and remove this user from
subscription lists.
In looking through the headers, I see that globalnoise.com is
using Sendmail 8.8.7.  If I remember correctly, this version of
sendmail has vulnerabilities allowing SPAMMERS to send out
SPAM.  Perhaps even root shell vulnerabilities.  Could someone
either this person from the lists, or break in to their system
via sendmail and delete their full mailbox so that we can stop
getting these notices?
Is anyone else getting these?
The contents of the bounceback message is:

I've overclocked my keyboard interface.  It's quite messy dipping my
hands into the mineral oil, but *MAN* is my keyboard ever fast now!
