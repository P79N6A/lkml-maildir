Quite nice.

Chuckle.  What does one call a Freudian slip, in computer-land?

Very neat.  That makes some things a bit easier, since I usually carry a 
'vanilla' branch as .git/refs/heads/master, and do all my modifications 
on other branches.
FWIW, git-changes-script (attached) facilitates #2 for me right now.  I 
use it just like BK's '-L' feature:
	cd netdev-2.6
	git checkout -f ieee80211
	git-changes-script -L ../linux-2.6 | less
That will produce the same output as the feature you just taught me,
	git log master..ieee80211
WARNING:  You have previously called git-changes-script quite ugly (not 
surprising), and this 'git log x..y' will probably replace it in my 
usage, long term.
