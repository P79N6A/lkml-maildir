Yup, GFP_ATOMIC can fail as can any memory allocation on out-of-memory
conditions unless you specify GFP_NOFAIL which will either succeed or
lock up the box. I think you can just WARN_ON() here? However, it's
probably safer to pass gfp flags from the callers here; otherwise we
end up doing tons of GFP_ATOMIC allocations which is not healthy in
general.
Also, I see some other BUG_ON() calls in the code which probably
should be converted to WARN_ON() as well.
