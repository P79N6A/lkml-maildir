Hi Antonio,
Sorry about the late reply but I've been busy and unable to return to
this issue until now.
I've tried building vbetool, but unfortunately all versions of it that
I can obtain refuse to build on my system, so at the moment I can't do
that testing for you.
I'll test the recently released 2.6.15-rc5-mm3 as well as
2.6.15-rc6-git1 and let you know if they have this issue or not.
