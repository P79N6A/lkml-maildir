These are PCI boards, not PCIe. The host computers are all Pentium3-M
systems. I tried enabling MSI on the Freescale boards in the driver, by
calling pci_enable_msi() during probe(), and it failed. I'm pretty sure
I can't do MSI.
I'll keep thinking about how to manage the DMA. Feel free to toss around
any ideas you have, though.
