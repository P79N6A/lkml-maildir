Hello, and thanks for your attention.
I'working on a kernel module that must collect mouse data in "real-time" and
redistribute the data to some clients.
On the basis of kmouse module I have writed my module.
But i have some problems with the line discipline,infact even if I register
the ldisc without errors, I can't read data collect with ldisc.receive
routine. that seems doesn't start in its work.
which may be the problem?
