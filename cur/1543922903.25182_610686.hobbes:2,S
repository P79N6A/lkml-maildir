This would have made sense whent he code was originally written
but it now has a (small) potential to break existing applications.
I guess if the _only_ fd's which don't implement fasync are inotify,
signalfd and other such new-and-obscure things then the risk is
probably acceptably low.
But is the proposed change actually very useful?
