Linux Kernel list,
I am having trouble with linux and it appears to be a memory leak in the
operating system...  I am still pretty new to Linux, I have been running
a system for about 6 months.
I started with Redhat v5.2, which had kernel 2.0.36-0.7  I upgraded it
with an RPM from RedHat to 2.0.36-3 without any problems.   I then
reconfigured it for SMP and recompiled the kernel.  In general it seemed
to be wworking fine for a while.  I don't know when this leak began.
I am running a dual pentium II machine.  Below is a sample output from
my machine:
It is clear that anything I run leads to permanent loss of free memory,
launching large applications chunks out up to 10 MB that is not
recovered.  What have I done? How can I fix this?
Thanks!
Jon
