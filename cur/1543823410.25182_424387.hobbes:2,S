Not really, at least not until IA64 and PARISC get adopted to the same (architecture independent) interface.

As above.

Oh, yes.

I don't think so. As far as I can tell, this isn't going to be a problem, it may just result in an extra, normally
unneeded, re-run of the loop.

Why?

I don't think so, given that this can be called only from the module loader. As Andi pointed out elsewhere, it may even
be unnecessary to do the locking at all.

Again, why?

This means what it says - it needs to be done, and I have no clear understanding of how these expressions are to be
treated, as I've never seen them in use anywhere.

Surely can do that, although I don't see why this should be needed in functions this small.
