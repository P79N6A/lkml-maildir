Oh, I found the regular DOS bootsector layout. 
The thing is, that's FAT-specific. The BIOS doesn't care, and the old 
Linux boot-sector stuff never had that, for example. It has the 0xAA55 
flag, and that makes it bootable.
I bet the same is true of other bootsectors too, that either didn't know 
about the FAT version, or just needed the space for better things and knew 
the BIOS didn't care. And some of them might easily have powers-of-two 
values in those magic bytes.
