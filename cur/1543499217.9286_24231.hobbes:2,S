:) It's strange idea to share memory between Linux systems with exporting
/dev/mem ;-) But the goal of my idea was only export /dev/dsp and other
sound related device. OK, I know there's nas ... but what's up if I want
to redirect the "sound output" of a program which supports only direct
/dev/dsp ? This is much more easy task to implement than do it for all
character devices I see now :)
