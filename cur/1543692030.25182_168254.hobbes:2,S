This probably has to do with the 128GB IDE disk boundary problems that 
have been recently coming about and nothing to do with Reiserfs (except 
that Reiserfs gets stuck with it). What version of the linux kernel are 
you using? Ie. provide some more info like what's 'uname -a' say on your 
system. There's been a few patches go by this list to fix this disk size 
problem. They should also be in the latest kernel releases too.
