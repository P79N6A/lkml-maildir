Removing `insecure' and doing exportfs -r -a  brings the problem back
again.

No.  All the /etc/exports lines are in terms of *.chubb.wattle.id.au
I'm using the debian-packaged version 1.0.2-1 nfs-utils (which has
no patches over the source version).
There are correct forward and reverse entries for xterm in the DNS:
: wombat ; host xterm
xterm.chubb.wattle.id.au        A       192.168.77.5
: wombat ; host 192.168.77.5
Name: xterm.chubb.wattle.id.au
Address: 192.168.77.5
It's only with xterm (which is a labtam/tektronix xterminal) that I
have a problem; other linux machines are fine.
