sizeof(pointer) is the object. ZERO_SIZE_PTR is the value stored in that 
object. Would you prefer PTR_TO_ZERO_SIZE_OBJ_VAL?
Maybe you would prefer ZERO_SIZE_OBJ instead. What you have is "a pointer 
object which points to a zero-sized object".
What if there were some construct in the kernel that never got deleted? 
We'll call it "struct foo * bar_ctl". What would you call a pointer to 
this? "bar_ctl_ptr". Or even "foo_ptr". So "ZERO_SIZE_OBJ_PTR" is the most 
correct form, and "ZERO_SIZE_PTR" is a convenient shortening. "ZERO_PTR" 
is too short and also confuses with NULL because NULL is a zero-value 
object, rather than a non-zero--value pointer to a zero-size object.
