Guys, we're all concerned about "seek times" as they are quite
significant compared to the read times. A disk capable of 5Mb per
second can do about 200k - 400k in random-reads.
About 6 years ago, I decided that "fsck" was taking too long, and I
rewrote it to use the elevator algorithm. (as it is a single task,
waiting for every IO to complete, the kernel elevator algorithm didn't
have a chance to do its work: at most one IO request in the queue at
any time).
The result was less than 5% improvement.
Intuitively the elevator algorithm is pretty important. In practise it
isn't all that important:
 -- Even During heavy IO there is not often more than a few threads 
    doing the IO, so the list of IOs that can be rearranged is not
    significant. 
 -- The parameters for modern disks make things less profitable. My first
    harddisk had a stepper motor for head-position that did around 1200 
    steps per second seeking 10 tracks takes 10 times longer than one track. 
    And a 100 tracks takes ten times longer than that. Modern disks seek
    track-to-track in a few milliseconds, and do the whole disk in under
    twenty. So fetching 20 random blocks in-order is going to be just
    a few milliseconds faster than just fetching in the random order. 
Roger.
