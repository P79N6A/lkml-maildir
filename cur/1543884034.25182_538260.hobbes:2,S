Yes. My fault. Bug is known, but it was to late to include patch 
fixing it in 2.6.21

Longhaul ver. 2 support is the reason. First machine that was reported 
not working is exactly like Your's: Samuel 2 600MHz. Patch reverting 
changes is queued in cpufreq git. You can find it at
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davej/cpufreq.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=07844252ffd81ec192a62014bada1016c9703765
