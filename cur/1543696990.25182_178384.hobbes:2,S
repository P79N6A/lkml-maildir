in fs/seq_file.c:seq_read()
        if (!m->buf) {
                m->buf = kmalloc(m->size = PAGE_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL);

are you saying that it is possible for userspace to request, say, 256K and 
say 250K of available data could be returned (with seq_file API) on a 
single read(2) call? I thought this is impossible and hence in the 
->show() routine I do this (similar to seq_printf()):
        struct task_struct *p = (struct task_struct *)v;
        struct proc *proc = (struct proc *)m->private;
	pack some data from task_struct into 'proc' ...
        if (m->count + PROCLEN < m->size) {
                memcpy(m->buf + m->count, proc, PROCLEN);
                m->count += PROCLEN;
                return 0;
        } else {
                m->count = m->size;
                return -1;
        }
So, as soon as ->show() is asked to display an element which didn't fit in
the m->buf page it returns -1 and so the user gets a page (or almost a
page, i.e.  as many entries as fit in there).
If you know of a way to return more than a page of data in one go, please 
do tell me.
But if such way existed then why in mm/slab.c:s_start() does exactly what 
I described, i.e. walks the list to the offset '*pos' saved from previous 
page?
Kind regards
