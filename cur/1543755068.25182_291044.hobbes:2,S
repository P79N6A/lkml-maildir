Hi Russell,
This is a different card (NetGear WG511U) than the USB card that
was discussed in the previous thread.  I haven't tried a 2.4.x kernel
yet, but that was on my list of things to do. :)  Unfortunately, this is
the only machine I've got which has CardBus so I'd have a hard time
attempting to reproduce on another machine.
Mike
