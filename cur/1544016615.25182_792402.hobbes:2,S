Oh great.  This often happens because people commit buggy patches to
their git trees, fix the bug a week later with a spearate commit, then
the whole lot gets shipped into mainline verbatib, with known bisection
holes.  The consensus appears to be that this is acceptable.

It needs to be bisected :(
At a guess I'd say that some piece of code somewhere did
schedule_delayed_work(work) and then scribbled on *work before the
timer got to run.  It could be anywhere at all in your kernel.
Thomas's debugobjects code could perhaps be used to find the culprit,
but alas the workqueue code hasn't been taught to use that framework.
We could do something like this:

It will print an object address and a call trace in
queue_delayed_work() and will print an object address in
delayed_work_timer_fn().
Hopefully when it oopses you'll see the bad object address which was
obtained by delayed_work_timer_fn().  Then, you can go back through the
trace and determine which callsite passed that object address to
queue_delayed_work().  Then we will have our culprit.
It'll possibly generate a lot of output, so logged netconsole might be
needed.
