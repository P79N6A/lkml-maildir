It is about the linux kernel as the vendor distributes its customized
linux kernel. And it is also about GPL licensing. And this forum is a good
choice since many developers of the kernel have indirectly or directly
interacted with the vendor before (a few are even employees).

Thats a very stupid comment to make. My first post says:
"Its the last sentence that is of concern. Does this mean no 3rd 
 party (who is not a customer) can get the GPL source code part of their 
 products ? Seems like a GPL violation of clause 3b in 
 
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html
 ."
It clearly asks a question about whether it is a violation or is not, as
regards a specific clause of the license. Next time please read the post
carefully before making comments.

That point was settled long ago as is obvious from the thread. Making the
same point repeatedly is just a waste of time.
