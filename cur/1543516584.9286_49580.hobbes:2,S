Hello!
I'd like to try out Linux on a CATS box, but I can't find an
installation boot image anywhere. Is there such a thing for CATS or
is this "Linux works wonderfully on CATS" stuff all the
associated web pages are full of just a load of BS?
I'd also love to get my hands on a working NetBSD 1.4 installation
boot image for CATS. The ones from ftp.netbsd.org are all broken.
