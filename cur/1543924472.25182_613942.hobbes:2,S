If the driver can benefit (or even requires) from more segments than you
can typically allocate in one piece, then it should enable chaining. In
general, all drivers must be transitioned to using the sg accessor
helpers, so we can eventually kill the sg chaining enable parameter in
the host template and just make it the default. The parameter is only
there as a transition help.
