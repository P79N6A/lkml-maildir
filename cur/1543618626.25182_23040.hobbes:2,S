If you are using test kernels, then you should be prepared to use
a serial console, IHMO.   (I use them often anyhow inasmuch as I
don't have big KVM switch and only one monitor)   
Also, if it gets to the init part and you're using redhat, you can 
interrupt the boot sequence (step-by-step mode) and then try to
page up.    
Just my two cents.
