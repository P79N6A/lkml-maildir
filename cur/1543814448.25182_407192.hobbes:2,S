OK, I've made some interesting progress here.
The driver is now doing all of its allocations of DMAable memory using
dma_alloc_coherent.  We do a get_page right after the allocation in
every case, and a put_page right before the free.  In the cases where
I'm allocating memory that I know or think might be greater than a page
in size, I'm using __GFP_COMP.
The nopage handler always does a get_page.
We now have a rational-looking set of VM_* flags, instead of a random
heap of whatever seemed to work.  And we're not touching PG_reserved.
And now everything works.  I have yet to examine /proc/meminfo in
microscopic detail after 100,000 runs to be sure we don't have a leak of
some kind, but I no longer get oopses or crashes after 20 repeated runs,
where before I didn't survive even one.
Whew!  What a relief.
Hugh, Andrew, Linus and Roland: thanks very much.  This has been a
tremendous help.
