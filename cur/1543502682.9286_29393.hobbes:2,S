Noone cares.  Files with CR/LF can happen anywhere, not just on FAT
filesystems.  Any application should be able to handle them appropriately
(i.e. at least not crash, hopefully allow easy diagnostic of the problem
or maybe even work just perfectly fine).
I argue that the above `should be' should actually be `is' because indeed
most apps already have to deal with those things.
I suggest:  kill the beast.  In the worst case, we'll know before 2.4 comes
out that support for CR/LF is not quite good enough in applications yet.
We can then either add it back in or rely on a podfuk kind of tool.
