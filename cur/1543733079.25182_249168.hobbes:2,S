This comes up fairly regularly.  See, for example,
http://lwn.net/Articles/88751/
 for what appears to be a much simpler
implementation.

I don't know how much of a problem this is in practice - there are all
sorts of nasty things which unprivileged apps can do to the system by
overloading filesystems.  Although most of them can be killed off by the
sysadmin.
(My infamous bash-shared-mappings stresstest can spend ten or more minutes
within a single write() call, but you have to try hard to do this).
