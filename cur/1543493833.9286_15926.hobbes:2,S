Aha!
In Debian 2.1, /etc/init.d/netbase contains:
    # This is the best method: turn on Source Address Verification and get
    # spoof protection on all current and future interfaces.
    if [ -e /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter ]; then
        echo -n "Setting up IP spoofing protection..."
        for f in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter; do
            echo 1 > $f
        done
        echo "done."
    fi
I was wondering why my rp_filter was defaulting to 1 when
Documentation/proc.txt clearly said that it defaulted to 0.
However, I still don't know exactly why this only happens in 2.2.6 and
not 2.2.0.  Diffs between the two trees don't contain the text
"rp_filter" at all.  Perhaps it was a higher-up reorganization of the
/proc hierarchy..
