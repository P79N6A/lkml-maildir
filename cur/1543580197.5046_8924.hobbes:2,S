It happens to me also.  In fact, I posted a message a week or two ago
asking if anybody else had similar trouble and if anybody knew anything
about it.  I eventually just quit using the ps/2 mouse port and hooked my
mouse up to the usb port to get it fixed.  It irritated me a great deal
though until I finally just switched it over to usb.
