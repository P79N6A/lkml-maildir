Hi,
Switching from 2.6.5 to 2.6.8.1, I found the same problem with accented chars 
at boot time (fbcon didn't set a unicode map in 2.6.5).
Looking into fbcon.c, I found that in the 2.6.8.1 release it is done in 
fbcon_startup (fbcon.c).  I don't know exactly the internals but I think this 
call is misplaced (maybe too late for the boot process ?).
So I placed a call to con_set_default_unimap in fbcon_init and it works fine !
Here is the patch

 }
 
 static void fbcon_deinit(struct vc_data *vc)
(I think it doesn't hurt to leave the previous call in fbcont_startup)
