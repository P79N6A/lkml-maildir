It seems to be indeed so. This was just posted to bugtraq & co:
Hi,
our initial posting contains a mistake about the vulnerability of the
2.2 kernel series. Since the 2.2 kernel series doesn't support the
MREMAP_FIXED flag it is NOT vulnerable. The source states "MREMAP_FIXED
option added 5-Dec-1999" but it didn't make into recent 2.2.x. We
apologize for inconvenience.

Here you go. And I don't need to worry about my 2.2.25-running pets ;-).
Kind regards,
