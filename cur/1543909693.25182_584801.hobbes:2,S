No. I exposed my reasoning, asked you back, but got no answer.
I'll do it again:
This operations are just manipulating bits, and are doing no
privileged operations at all. Nothing that can be paravirtualized, in
the proper sense. Altough we do can introduce such operations for
clarity of code, I personally believe it is not the way to go.
What I did, then, was move this outside  the PARAVIRT ifdef, which
lead to a much cleaner code.
