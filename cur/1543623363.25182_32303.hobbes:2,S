Yeah, but you shouldn't judge rmap by what's in your tree ;))
Balancing is quite simple, too.

That's what I used to think, too.  The folks at IBM showed
me I was wrong and the pagemap_lru_lock is critical.

OK, lets try to put classzone on top of a Hammer "NUMA" system.
You'll have one CPU starting to allocate from zone A, falling
back to zone B and then further down.
Another CPU starts allocating at zone B, falling back to A
and then further down.
How would you express this in classzone ?  I've looked at it
for quite a while and haven't found a clean way to get this
situation right with classzone, which is why I have removed
it.
As for kswapd going crazy, that is nicely fixed by having
per zone lru lists... ;)
