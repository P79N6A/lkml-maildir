not quite true.   Run a program on an NFS root based system, modify the
files it has mmaped (on the NFS server).  Do you expect the program to
behave correctly?  Locally, you wouldn't be able to modify it (you would
have to move it away and put a new copy in its place), I could be wrong,
but I don't think that limitation exists if doing it with NFS.
