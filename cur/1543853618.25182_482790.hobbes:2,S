The problem with this approach is the average user will just think linux 
sucks - it is so
slow, they won't know how to investigate or trouble shoot the problem, 
and just go back to winblows.
I've got an ich7 chipset that supports sata and ide. My laptop has only 
ide devices so why
is there a conflict that has to be resolved by combined mode? Why can't 
the sata driver
be smart enough to know there are no sata devices for it to handle?
