Yes.

No comment -- I'm not sure how to measure flamage.

Yup.

Seems nice. Notice that I'm not sure when next bug that will require binary search
will pop up, so it may take a while before we'll actually know if it helped.

Its certainly better than current situation. Next nasty ACPI problem will tell ;-).
