My guess is that what is happening is: apm receives the event
and notifies apmd an X.  X blanks the display and returns.
apmd processes the event and returns.  apm does suspend().
But then you hit some BIOS bug.  Or the BIOS expects the 
OS to turn off the LCD light before returning.
Does it make any difference if apmd and X are NOT running?
Stephen: Do you think it would be worth sticking a call to
apm_console_blank inside suspend() for this person to see
if it helps?

P.S.  Stephen:  Should the line "ignore_normal_resume = 1;"
inside suspend() be put prior to the sti()?
