??  In really_probe(), driver_sysfs_add() is called _before_ ->probe.  So
it's okay to fail there.  And in device_bind_driver(), which is what you
were talking about above, ->probe doesn't get called anywhere.
At least, in my copy of Greg KH's development tree that's what happens.

I agree.

Doing it per subsystem sounds right.  It looks like the multithread
probing code was added without sufficient thought beforehand.

Oh, okay. (Hmmm, that message was posted earlier today...)

I don't care too much one way or another.  Although missing symlinks might 
cause problems for certain user programs.

No, I meant device_bind_driver().  Try to create the symlinks first, and 
if that succeeds (or if you don't care when it fails) then call 
driver_bound().  This confusion may be a result of looking at different 
source trees.

Other people may disagree about device_bind_driver().  Best to let it fail 
for now and fix these other problems first.  It can always be changed 
later.
Do you want to write another patch?
