I'm not very worried because mixing steppings is generally unsupported anyways
and in Linux also doesn't work well with it.
(e.g. my old rig with one CPU FXSAVE capable, one CPU not never worked without
kernel hacks) 
It's probably not worth the effort anyways. The people who build such strange
systems can tweak their kernels for it too.
