First i would like to thank you for your answer 
When i do a simple "find / * | grep bla bla" the Load is over 3 after
10 seconds and about 10 after a minute.
I did a "top" and switched to non-idle mode. The only processes that appear
constantly when the load is such high are "kupdated" and "kreiserfsd". Any
ideas?
