see my general objection to this change (under the [PATCH 22/23] 
subject), but even looking at the pure patch note that it does the flag 
update incorrectly and in a bisect-boot-unfriendly way: the queue at 
this point changes kernel functionality and has side-effects. The right 
way to do flags updates is to first introduce them, then change things 
over.
