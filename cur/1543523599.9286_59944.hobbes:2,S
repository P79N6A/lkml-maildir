I was compiling the 2.3.40 kernel when a string of seemingly related 
errors occurred in drivers/char/char.o. These errors all seem to have 
to do with I2C. In the character section of the kernel config, I left 
everything the same and I marked Video4Linux to be compiled into the 
kernel as well as the BookTree driver to be installed. When I took the 
Video4Linux flag away, it compiled fine. Also, I don't think I had any 
I2C modules as being marked installed. Should I have done this? I 
haven't had this problem with previous kernel configs. Also, I used 
the latests alpha patch (2.3.41-3) just to see if that fixed it, but 
it didn't. If anyone would like to correct me on what I did wrong, or 
maybe what is wrong with the configuration script, I would appreciate 
anything.
