I've written one before for the Boomerang[1] project.  Don't worry
about the system calls, that's not the point.  I do wonder if you can
mix Mach-O and ELF binaries in the same process however.. that would
be good.  If you like, send me the code and I'll take a look at it.

  I don't work on this anymore
due to work constraints.
