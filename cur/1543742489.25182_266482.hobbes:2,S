You could drop all but those specific capabilities.  But, since you only
seem to need those during startup there's not a huge value in doing
anything other than what you're already doing.

Dropping uid is a fine idea, esp. since you have to start from uid 0
to get the bind/setsched/mlock bits done.  It just exposes a case where
the mlock change might surprise users, which is why I hope it's not the
common usage pattern (and I think most are root apps, so we should be ok).
thanks,
