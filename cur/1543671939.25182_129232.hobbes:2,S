Hi,
With 2.5.68 (vanilla) I have a problem with using the '\' key.
In 2.4.20-gentoo-r3 this key has the keycode 124 in 2.5.68 it has
keycode 55. I have compiled in the exactly the same native languages and
I don't know any special settings for keyboards actually (default
language is in both kernels UTF8).
Is there anything known about this? If needed I attach all detailed
information, but at the moment I am not sure if needed.
The Base is a Gentoo Linux 1.4rc2 with ~x86 and all latest updates.
