   If you are really newbie in Linux - I can advice you to try FreeBSD.
   By default FreeBSD (as of version 3.2) is much less aggressive in 
caching and buffering. I never saw Linux greedy caching/buffering 
working good - it always has some stupid edge cases when it is 
easier/faster to power-off/power-on/fsck system, rather than to get to 
console and kill offending process.
   But sure - Linux's throughput is much higher that in *BSD.
   Benchmarketing.
