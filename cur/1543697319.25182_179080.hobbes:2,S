Last time I checked, all 32-bit PowerPC chips ran that clock at 1/4
of the bus clock speed.
That may be adequate for time-of-day and I/O delays and such, but
it's worthless for timestamps or performance measurements.
It's possible to count core clocks via a performance counter, but
I don't know if they are synced between CPUs.
