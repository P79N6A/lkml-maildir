Thanks to GregKH for looking at this too. 
Odd one this.  It seems like whoever looks at some files in /sys first, owns
them.  e.g I just created a new user fred, rebooted.  Then "find /sys -user
fred" shows loads of files.  Permissions are 644 and so the owner is
important.
In particular, "echo -n disk > /sys/power/state" will cause the machine to
suspend to disk (hence the security tag).
Found when I suddenly thought, "hang on, shouldn't I be root" :-)
Results so far:
2.6.8-rc2-mm1 - bad
2.6.8-rc2 - okay
2.6.8-rc3 - okay
2.6.8-rc3-mm1 - bad
.config file available on request.  compiled with gcc 3.3.4 (debian 1:3.3.4-6)
