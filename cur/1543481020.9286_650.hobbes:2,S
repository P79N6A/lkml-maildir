The bug:
        System is a brand new Dell Dimension XPS R450 (P-II/450MHZ,
        128MB RAM, 8GB IDE disk, Internal IDE Zip drive).  During
        boot, I get the following errors for the Zip drive (which
        is set as the slave device on the secondary IDE controller
        (i.e. /dev/hdd):
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0x10a0-0x10a7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio

IDE Floppy support has been compiled into the kernel.  Under pre7 and
earlier, I get the following messages:
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later

hdd: 98304kB, 96/64/32 CHS, 4096 kBps, 512 sector size, 2941 rpm
(Also, in both cases I should point out that there is a disk in the
drive during boot.  If I boot pre8 without a disk present, I still
get the same errors.)
