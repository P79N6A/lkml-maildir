okay, let's reopen the case. you want me to monitor this bit? perhaps
it will be 1 in case of an error condition. for the via epia board, this
would contradict with the specs, right? but *maybe* the bit is indeed
1 in case of an error, so we could possibly fix the problem just in time,
instead of (ugly) storing some temporary value globally across functions.
