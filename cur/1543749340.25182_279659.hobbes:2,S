Ok, probably - but who said this? IIRC there is no standard describing 
what should be in proc and what should not. I do not think that after so 
many years of storing everyting in /proc there is any chance that you will 
remove all not [0-9]* dirs and files from /proc before the sun will stop 
lighting... :-) Many, really _many_, binary only apps are using proc for 
999999 different (often stupid) things - how you will change that? There 
is way too late for such change, in my opinion.
And polluting / with proc, sys, dev, selinux, debug and who knows what 
else is at least equally bad.
Thanks,
