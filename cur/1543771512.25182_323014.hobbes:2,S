But the firmware code handles the memory stuff that you duplicated
already.  That's a big win too.

Never, you should call request_firmware_nowait() instead.  And do it
from your module init function.

That's what request_firmware_nowait() is for.

It's easier for the user to just copy the firmware to the sysfs file
whenever they want to.  No messing with hotplug events or filenames.
