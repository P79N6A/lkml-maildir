You cannot hope to handle all possible effects arising from an app 
providing an invalid sg header / cdb.
Once you start talking "recovery" you are already screwed:  we are 
talking about low-level hardware commands that are passed straight to 
the hardware.  It is trivial to lock up hardware, brick hardware, and 
corrupt data at that level.
If this is NOT a privileged app, we must update the command validation 
to ensure that invalid commands are not transported to the hardware.
If this is a privileged app, our work is done.  Fix the app.  We gave 
root rope, and he took it.
I even venture to say that "accept anything, clean up afterwards" is 
/impossible/ to implement, in addition to being dangerous.
