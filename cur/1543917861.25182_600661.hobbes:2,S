among other things, one of the creepy issues here is the definition in
include/linux/netfilter/xt_sctp.h of the macro:
...
#define SCTP_CHUNKMAP_COPY(destmap, srcmap)                     \
        do {                                                    \
                int i;                                          \
                for (i = 0; i < ELEMCOUNT(chunkmap); i++)       \
                        destmap[i] = srcmap[i];                 \
        } while (0)
...
  i'm not a big fan of macros that refer to objects that aren't
parameters to the macro, especially when all the rest of them *do*.

p.s.  ELEMCOUNT is simply an alternative to ARRAY_SIZE, which could
certainly be rewritten that way.
