Thanks.

Yeah, 2.6.12-git5 was what it was against, sorry I didn't mention that.

Hm, that is odd.  That shouldn't happen.
Wait, I think it was due to where you put the class hooks, try it
against Linus's latest tree, it will work better there (in fact, I don't
know if it would work properly in 2.6.12 due to the class driver core
changes.)
Could you try that and let me know if it still has issues?
thanks,
