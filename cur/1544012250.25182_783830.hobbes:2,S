It doesn't really matter what day it is, or what holiday (if any) you're 
celebrating, because even if you sit at home, alone in your dank basement, 
without any holidays or friends, I bring you a tiding of great cheer: you 
can now download Linux-2.6.28, and compile it to your hearts content!
Listen to the cheerful grinding of your harddisk as you reboot into an 
all-new kernel - and I'm sure that if your computer could smile, it would 
have a big silly grin on its non-existent face. So as you sit there in 
your basement, give your computer the holiday cheer too.
In fact, even _if_ you have friends or family, leave them to their endless 
toil over that christmas ham or turkey, and during the night, when they're 
asleep, you can give them that magical present of a newly updated 
computer. When they wake up tomorrow morning, tell them how you saw Santa 
crawl down the chimney with his USB stick in hand, updating the OS of all 
good boys and girls.
Ho, ho, ho,
		Linus "almost Santa" Torvalds

Not a whole lot has changed since -rc9: some DVB updates, some AMD IOMMU 
stuff, a few scsi driver updates, and some PCI hotplug regression fixes.
The dirstat looks complicated:
  11.3% arch/x86/kernel/
  11.3% arch/x86/
  12.9% arch/
   4.9% drivers/acpi/
   5.3% drivers/md/
  19.0% drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/
  23.2% drivers/media/dvb/
   5.8% drivers/media/video/
  29.1% drivers/media/
   5.1% drivers/net/
  12.6% drivers/pci/hotplug/
  13.2% drivers/pci/
   7.5% drivers/scsi/
  70.0% drivers/
   7.4% fs/9p/
but in fact it all boils down to just a couple hundred changed lines, in 
just 70 commits (average size: 5 lines each).
