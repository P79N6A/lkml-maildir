Subject: [PATCH 1/3] ps3: vuart: fix error path locking
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This stray down would cause a permanent sleep which doesn't seem correct. 
The other uses of this semaphore appear fairly mutex like it's even initialized
with init_MUTEX() ..  So here a patch for removing this one down().
