I tried 2.4.5-ac8 which includes the newest s390-Patches from IBM and I
found out, that it is possible to access shared memory but when you
free it, the machine crashs.
The output on console seems to come from __swap_free in swapfile.c:
It was a mixture of
  swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
  swap_free: offset exceeds max
If you need detailed order of those messages I could reproduce a crash for
you. ;-)
I reproduced it with 2.4.5 and 2.4.5-ac8 but I never tested  2.4.4,
but having a quick look at the code it saw that shm changed from 2.4.3 to 
2.4.4.
2.4.3 runs very stable on my architecture.
For everything else 2.4.5-ac8 seems to run quite fine on zSerie.
