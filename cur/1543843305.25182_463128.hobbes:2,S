I've solved a linear equations set :)

Then you need to solve a set of 40 equations. This sounds weird, but
don't afraid - sets like these are solved lightly.

I don't understand your idea. Limit does _not_ imply anything - it's
just a limit.
You may limit anything to anyone w/o bothering the consequences.
Guarantee implies that the resource you guarantee will be available and
this "will be" is something not that easy.
So I repeat my question - how can you be sure that these X megabytes you
guarantee to some group won't be used by others so that you won't be able
to reclaim them?
