Strange. Are you sure you really did it in the following order:
make clean (better: make mrproper)
- configure the kernel
make bzImage
- install your new bzImage
make modules
make modules_install
- boot into your new kernel
We haven't had any bug report regarding your problem, and I'm personally 
also running plain 2.4.17 on one of my boxes without any problems.
