Umm... I don't think so. Check d_invalidate() for some examples. It cares
for files vs. directories. Has to.

You know what tar(1) will do with you for that, don't you? Same ->st_ino
with different contents... And unlike procfs, here tar is a Reasonable
Thing(tm).

So we did. I also remember the hell we had there due to the weird aliases
mess.

Oh, yes. Linus, I would _really_ ask you to postpone the activity in that
direction until
	a) ->revalidate() interface (along with its races) is sorted out
	b) ->getattr() will be in place and used by VFS
	c) icache hashing by ->i_dev issue is sorted out, quite possibly
along with the ->st_fstype thing
Otherwise we are in for PITA and I have some idea which A it will be ;-/
ObPlan9: what do you think about the following

FD2PATH(2)                                             FD2PATH(2)
NAME
       fd2path - return file name associated with file descriptor
SYNOPSIS
       #include <u.h>
       #include <libc.h>
       int fd2path(int fd, char *buf, int nbuf)
DESCRIPTION
       As described in intro(2), the kernel stores a rooted  path
       name  with  every open file or directory; typically, it is
       the name used in the original access of the file.  Fd2path
       returns the path name associated with open file descriptor
       fd.  Up to nbuf bytes of the name are stored  in  buf;  if
       the  name  is too long, it will be silently truncated at a
       UTF-8 character boundary.  The name is always  null-termi-
       nated.  The return value of fd2path will be zero unless an
       error occurs.
       Changes to the underlying name space  do  not  update  the
       path name stored with the file descriptor.  Therefore, the
       path returned by fd2path may no longer refer to  the  same
       file  (or  indeed any file) after some component directory
       or file in the path has been removed, renamed or  rebound.
       As  an  example, getwd(2) is implemented by opening .  and
       executing fd2path on the resulting file descriptor.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Now, unlike Plan 9 we _do_ update the path, so fixing the problem
mentioned above is easy (we will need to deal with unlinked files,
but that's trivial - return -ENOENT to distinguish that from the
normal case).
Basically, it's about exposing d_path() to userland. Patch below should do
the job, modulo actual adding sys_fd2path into the tables. BTW, I suspect
that we really ought to stop this " (removed)" thing, even in procfs
symlinks - too ambiguos and can be done better (e.g. something in ->i_mode
of the link). Comments?
