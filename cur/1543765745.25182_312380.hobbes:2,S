PI behavior is pretty well spec'd out at this point, but its possible
to assume that no userspace locks are taken after the first kernel
lock is locked, and that the task exits the kernel without holding any
kernel locks. That makes it easier to think about, and from that
perspective, I see no complications with the transitive PI across
the user / kernel boundary.
If a userspace task has RT priority, it should be able to bump along
lower priority kernel tasks, whether they (or it) are holding any user
mutexes, or not.

Bill, we are really trying to do this right, open, on the table.
This is an open invitation to anyone interested to get on the line
with us on Wednesday. Get the info for the FREE call here:

Let us know, if its possible to disclose that info.
