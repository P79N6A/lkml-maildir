What is that if () doing there?  bdev->bd_inode is *never* NULL - it's
set when we allocate the bdev and never changed; the code setting it
is
        if (inode->i_state & I_NEW) {
                bdev->bd_contains = NULL;
                bdev->bd_inode = inode;
so you are not going to have it NULL, no matter what.
And filp->private_data is set in raw_open() by
        filp->private_data = bdev;
a couple of lines after
        filp->f_mapping = bdev->bd_inode->i_mapping;
so it's not going to be NULL either.
