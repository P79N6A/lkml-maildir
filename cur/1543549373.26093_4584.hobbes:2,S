virt_to_* is only valid for addresses that the kernel returns from kmalloc
and get_free_page, or an address in the kernels direct mapped memory region.
Note that the kernel stack is also located in the direct mapped memory
region.
virt_to_* is not valid for:
  vmalloc'd space
  module space (this is the same as vmalloc'd space)
  user space
  any other weird and wonderful address that you can think of
In other words, your usage of the above is not correct.
