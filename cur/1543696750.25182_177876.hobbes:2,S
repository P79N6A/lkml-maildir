Subject: 2.4.23-rc1 depmod failure of w9968cf - I2C dependency

This is on sparc64 where I2C seems to have some problems.
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.23-rc1/kernel/drivers/usb/w9968cf.o
depmod:         i2c_add_adapter_Rd0bcafe7
depmod:         i2c_del_adapter_R35adeeff
Probaly this module should have an explicit dependency on I2C.
