My dream for a while was also to be able to trace what particular blocks
(and from which files) are read off disk. This would allow for existence
of a user-land application that speeds up disk access (for example a big
program faults in different places in its file and reads different
configuration files on startup. this pattern does not change - bc 
unless the program initialized nobody can interact with it and alter
the pattern)
