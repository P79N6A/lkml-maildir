Hmm, maybe. Removing all sources of latency from the CPU kind of
implies that you have to audit the whole kernel for source of
latency.

OK, but you then are very restricted in what you can do, and easily
can break it especially if you run any userspace on that CPU. If
you just run a kernel module that, after setup, doesn't use any
other kernel resources except interrupt handling, then you might be
OK (depending on whether even interrupt handling can run into
contended locks)...
If you started doing very much more, then you can easily run into
trouble.
