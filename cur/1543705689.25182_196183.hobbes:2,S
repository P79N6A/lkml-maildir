Hmm. Compiler? Why would AS-3 in particular have problems?

This _seems_ to be the code
		...
                if (!pfn_valid(pfn) || PageReserved(pfn_to_page(pfn)))
                        set_pte(pte, pfn_pte(pfn, prot));
		...
in particular, it disassembles to
	0x8048490 <insn>:       mov    (%eax),%eax
	0x8048492 <insn+2>:     test   $0x800,%eax
	0x8048497 <insn+7>:     je     0x80484a9
	0x8048499 <insn+9>:     mov    %ebx,%eax
	0x804849b <insn+11>:    mov    0x4c(%esp,1),%edx
	0x804849f <insn+15>:    shr    $0x14,%eax
which seems to be the "PageReserved(pfn_to_page(pfn))" test.
This implies that you have either:
 - a buggy "pfn_valid()" macro (do you use CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM?)
 - or a buggy compiler (it sure ain't the compiler I use, since that one 
   will generate a "testb $8,%ah" instead)
It might help if you disassembled the code (in your kernel) around that 
point, since that might give a clue about it.
Quite honestly, to me it looks like the address being remapped is likely 
in %ebp (0xf5200000), and that pfn is in %ebx (0x000f5200), and that your 
pfn_valid() is buggered, causing a totally bogus "struct page *" from 
"pfn_to_page()".
