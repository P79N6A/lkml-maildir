As far as I know (at least that's what akpm told me last I submitted a
similar patch) it's prefered that email addresses are listed in
CREDITS and MAINTAINERS only and when addresses change and need to be
updated that's a perfect time to get them out of the source and into
the proper location.
And seeing that Manfred's address in CREDITS is already correct, I
believe a patch that simply replaces "Manfred Spraul
<manfred@colorfullife.com>" with "Manfred Spraul" in the source files
would be better.
