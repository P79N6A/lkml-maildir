Stephen Tweedie, Dave Rosenthal, Keith Packard and myself had an extensive
discussion on similar ideas around process quantum scheduling (the X server
would like to be able to forward quantum to clients) as well at Usenix.
This is closely related, and needed to finally fully control interactive
feel in the face of "greedy" clients.
My memory is that it sounded like things could become very interesting
with such a facility, and might be ripe for 2.5.
Keith, Stephen, Dave, do you remember the details of our discussion?
