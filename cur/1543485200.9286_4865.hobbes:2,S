More drunken ramblings from our Leader:
           Host Chris_MSNBC says:
           CyberYoda:   What percentage of the kernel is the same as
your 
           original release?
           Host Linus_Torvalds- says:
           Basically none.  The original release was about 10,000 lines
and all 
           of those have been rewritten pretty much. Right now its in
the amount 
           of 15,000,000 now. 
Close, only off by a factor of ten or so.
