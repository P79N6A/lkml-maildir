Hi,
   I'm currently using Jindrich Makovicka's latest patch, and it works
very well.  It has all the rivatv 0.6 stuff rolled in, but as long as you
don't configure in all the v4l/tv-out stuff, and you just configure in
rivafb, everything works very well.  This one seems not to have some of
the minor glitches I saw with rivafb 0.9.0.  I have the patch applied on
top of 2.4.1-pre3 and didn't have any problems applying it.  The patch can
be found here:
