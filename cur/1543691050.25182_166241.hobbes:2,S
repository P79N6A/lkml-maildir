If we adopt a bit-per-CPUtype or similar approach maybe. But then you have
to go back and test each code section to see if it applies to multiple
types. I'm happy to have existing code stay, as long as there's a way to
clean it up (or attempt to do so). I don't think making super clean is
compatible with stability, and I'd rather see sections marked as
architecture specific as the performance and embedded folks look for
places to clean up the kernel.
I'm not on a crusade to get the tiny kernel, just to (a) provide a path
for future work started by the config "feature removal" menu, and (b)
avoid inserting a chunk of very specific code without ifdefs, now that
developers have started thinking about putting the kernel on a diet. I
don't suggest we do anything which will break existing code, just not
introduce new bloat right now.
