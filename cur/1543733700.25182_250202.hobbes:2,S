(yeah. not a big issue - can happen in any order. this patch is against
BK-curr.)

some of the architectures dont want to (and cannot) use the generic
functions for one reason or another. So the proper approach i believe is
to provide these generic functions the architectures can plug in. I can
do an asm-generic/hardirq.h that adds all the definitions, for
architectures that dont need any special IRQ logic.

it compiles fine on x86, x64, ppc and ppc64. Why do you think it wont
compile on others?
wrt. unused generic functions - why dont we drop them link-time?
