I couldn't help but notice that the Linuxant Modem drivers appear to be
GPL'd, as a strings of the modules shows that License=GPL.
Therefor, it seems to be O.K. to send this script out to unlock them.
Perhaps the script should be GPL'd.
Attached is a perl script that generates the keys to the GPL'd Linuxant
Modem Drivers for HCF and HSF modems.
Please do not use this script on Non-GPL'd modules ;-)  
As that would clearly be illegal.
