How is possible to use a text editor? Aren't most of them use a temporary file?
I spent some time ago documenting it in
http://wiki.linux-ntfs.org/doku.php?id=texteditorpitfall
 after it came
up on the linux-ntfs-dev mailing list (long ago). Am I wrong?
I remember Rich writing about some command of vim to disable the
temporary file feature, but you haven't mentioned that one, so I
assume it works for you "out-of-the-box".
Sincerely
