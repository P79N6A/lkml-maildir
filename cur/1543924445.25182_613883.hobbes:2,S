I have no box here to test this - my laptop won't help.
But I did another test:
I replaced the 80-wire cable with a 40-wire cable. Then the BIOS warns 
about "no 80-wire cable connected". The kernel boot and seems to enable 
UDMA100 which leads to some BadCRC errors. After that the drive is in 
udma3-mode(hdparm) IIRC but not in udma5, as when using the right cable.
Maybe it's not that clever to add the drive to the ivb_list?
As far as I understood it, pata_acpi should fix the problem, but I'm not 
sure on the required configuration. Do I have to disable the normal 
IDE-support? How 'experimental' is the PATA support?
