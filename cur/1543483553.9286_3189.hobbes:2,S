Oh did I get you wrong here, do you mean PCI I/O registers that just
happen to be mem mapped on non x86 architectures or do you actually
mean PCI shared memory type registers?

For I/O port type things you use request_region(), for real shared
memory there is currently no mechanism afaik.

We will need it for supporting the ISA bus bridges for the Amiga,
Atari and other boxes.
