floats are a pain!
As we should have only one value per file, why not just "know" the units
of the file, so that we don't have to mess with a decimal point.  Makes
the kernel a lot simpler and smaller, and then userspace can easily
parse the number and do any needed conversions.

Again, I would vote for simple integers.
And good documentation about what each file's units are :)
