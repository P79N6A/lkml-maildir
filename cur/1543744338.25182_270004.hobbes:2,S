I installed -ac7 yesterday, and have been testing for 24 hours now with 
no problems. (It's way better than the scsi hack from ITE) There is just 
one thing, the driver did not enable DMA by default, needless to say 
performance was awful. I turned it on with hdparm and everything appears 
ok. Is this by design due to the experimental nature of the driver?
I am testing by copying about 400 mb of files from one folder to another 
on the raid array, over and over again. Is there a howto or test 
software out there for better method to *really* hammer on the driver?
Thanks,
Robert Toole
