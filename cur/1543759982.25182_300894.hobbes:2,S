Actually, 4K or 8K these days for x86.  But, no, it means that EACH
PROCESS is constrained to the kernel stack.  The stacks are per-process.
The kernel never "runs on its own" -- it is always in the context of a
process (which has its own kernel stack) or an interrupt handler (which
either shares the previous process's stack or has its own stack,
depending on CONFIG_IRQSTACKS).

Yes, I just said that in the previous email.  The kernel stack cannot be
resized.  It is fixed.  It is one or two pages, depending on configure
option.  That is, 4 or 8K.
The _user-space_ stack, what the application actually uses, is
dynamically resizable.  But we are not talking about that.

I don't know what you mean.  alloc_thread_info() creates the thread_info
structure and stack.
