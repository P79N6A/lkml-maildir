i386 has it, so everyone uses it.
asm/user.h uses it for NBPG, which appears in gdb configure scripts.
Maybe it doesnt trigger there because the sysconf SC_* macros match.
other places where asm/page.h is used:
util-linux configure scripts, strace, xorg-11, and alot more.
Have to check if they really need it.
