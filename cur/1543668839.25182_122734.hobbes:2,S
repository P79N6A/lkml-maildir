You're guessing here.  At least for oracle, that behaviour is dependant on 
the locality of accesses.  Given that each user has their own process you 
can bet there is a fair amount of locality to their transactions.

It is still useful for things outside of the pure databases on 32 bits 
realm.  Consider a fast bochs running 32 bit apps on a 64 bit machine -- 
should it have to deal with the overhead of zillions of vmas for emulating 
page tables?
If anything, I think we should be moving in the direction of doing more 
along the lines of remap_file_pages: things like executables might as well 
keep their state in page tables since we never discard them and instead 
toss the vma out the window.
