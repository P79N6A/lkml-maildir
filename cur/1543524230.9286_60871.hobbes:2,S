Even if the change A->B was incorrect ?
Notice, that I have reversed only the sections that were incorrect according
to documentation...
In some places (eg. for CONFIG_ROOT_NFS) the "m" dependency should 
disable the option - so suggested changes to Configure break it.
Also, nobody fixed all parsers (Configure, Menuconfig, xconfig) and 
Documentation/kbuild/config-language.txt
Is Michael <mec@shout.net> still the configuration utilities maintainer ?
