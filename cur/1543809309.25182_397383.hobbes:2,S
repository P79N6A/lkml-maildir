You seem to have hardware monitoring drivers loaded on the system, so
I'd suggest that you watch the returned values over time. If the
hardware is going wrong it might show there. Your system could be
overheating for some reason (stuck fan...)
The fact that older kernels were seemingly working better doesn't prove
much. You were running these kernels before, not now, and hardware
*does* age, contrary to what people seem to think. If you want to make
certain that older kernels were indeed working better for purely
software reasons, you should switch back to such an old kernel and see
if things actually improve or not.
A wild guess while I'm at it... Is the machine behind a KVM switch by
any chance? I have a fun (old) motherboard here which reboots when I
unplug the keyboard and plug it again. Never seen that before...

Note that the first case ("a kernel came out that fixed the problem")
doesn't mean that the hardware was not at fault. There are quite a few
quirks in the Linux kernel code which are just there to workaround
known hardware or BIOS bugs.
