This is a large patch, and I have neither the time nor competence to review
it :(
I hope that someone will find the time to do a detailed review-n-test of
this code, because the IPC code is pretty touchy and isn't well-maintained,
as I'm sure you have noticed.
Meanwhile I'll queue the patches up for a bit of compile-time and runtime
testing, thanks.

As a separate cleanup: the code casts the ipc_findkey to some outer struct
in all cases.  It would be nicer to convert this to container_of().  It'll
generate the same code, but it actually represents what the code is doing
and perhaps means that the code will continue to work if the `struct
kern_ipc_perm' is not at the start of the containing struct.
