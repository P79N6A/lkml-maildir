->  Sounds like you're heading for a very complex design with lots of
->  threads.  That's a good way to run into deadlock issues.  The best
->  way to avoid deadlock IMHO is to introduce the absolute minimum
->  number of threads, and put a well-understood interface between each
->  thread and the rest of the world.
I actually thought abotu thread a logn way back and its not hard...
just split image to blend/scale/render into N sections vertically (N
equal sized strips) ands have each thread handle each strip. all
ttherad wait till busy count > 0 - onec its < 1 all threads are done
and function can actually return to application control.
->  For instance, what if all your API functions did was queue drawing

->  off the queue and executing them?  (Or maybe two worker threads, if
->  you like.)  That way, you'll allow the user's app to run in parallel with
->  your rendering, and you'll only have a single interface across which
->  to worry about thread safety.
not how it works at the lib api - it's all immediate mode
design/implimentation. any queued drawing shoudl/would happen at a much
higher level in the calling application or toolkit. thats how i'd doign
it now ahyway with queueing happinign at the visual objedt/widget
stage. the aim is to spend as little time inside an api call as
possible and long-lived crunching calls like blending an 800x600 RGBA
image onto another woudl do well with being split into threads for
multiple cpu boxes :)
