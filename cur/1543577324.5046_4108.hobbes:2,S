    In the embedded world you will regularly see adherence to that
    model in the specification. Firstly because the users do it,
    secondly because power cuts ensure it happens anyway
With ACPI you should be able to hook things like the off button and
make it do the right thing. This more like what your video and TV do,
as opposed to your toaster.
The off button need not and _does not_ remove power instantly (if at
all) on many appliances.

P.S. Yeah, I'm making a few assumptions about your appliances. but
     I'm sure you know what I mean.
