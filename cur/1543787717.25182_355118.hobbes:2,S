2.6.13 already has it. Note that the io priority is only inherited when a 
process first starts so doing renice to something already running will only 
change the cpu nice, not the ionice. You can do that on the fly using the 
ionice application. If you look in the kernel source in 
Documentation/block/ioprio.txt you'll find the source to ionice.c
