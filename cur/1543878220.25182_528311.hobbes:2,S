You are a funny guy Jan.
Here you are, once again, cutting out my most useful information, ie,
the data I was discussing, while complaining that I cut out your most
useful information. 
You know,... you cut out this bit:

And this bit: 
Jan,... Here is another section, you conveniently cut out. Maybe you
should explain why you cut out this section? Was it embarrassing to you?
I mean, your statement is sort of correct,... but it shows a basic
misunderstanding of filesystems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
It is true that I considered your "most useful information," an
irrelevant section, which is why it was cut out (ignored).
I did not see my doing this, any worse than you doing it. I did not
realize that you were be so impolite.
As to your email being private, I had thought I had joined a mailing
list. I had not idea your email was meant to be private and just
considered it like all the others.
Now you mention it, I wondered why the email did not automatically list
the mailing lists, as recipients, and I had to add them. If I had
realized this I may have added the mailing lists as recipients, anyway.
It would be like me to do such. However, you should understand that I am
new to mailing lists.

So, likewise, I saw your comments (you know the ones you miss so much)
the first time around, as I was not convinced of their worth.
The benchmarks measure certain data. Its fine you do not read into them,
stuff that isn't there, like reliability, for example.

I never said I wanted discussion, you just said I did.
You just repeat, and repeat, and repeat.
In reality, I quite appreciate reasonable discussion. But, I doubt I
will get much from you.

Why do you think I hate reiserfs developers? That is an insane claim.
Why would I hate reiser3 developers?
Why would I hate reiser4 developers? 
Why would I even dislike them?
I think Hans Reiser is a genius. Is that what you mean by hate?
Answer this question. Why do YOU think I am antagonizing reiserfs
developers?
You must have a reason for stating what you have.

Why are you attacking me with sarcasm, when I have just stated a simple
fact?

Yes, I ignored it,.... is that a crime?

I believe that compression in REISER4 is just a wrapper for gzip or lzo.
So each file is compressed and your "corruption propagation" is just in
your imagination.

You deliberately ignored the fact that bad blocks are NOT dealt with by
the filesystem,... but by the operating system. Like I said: If your
filesystem is writing to bad blocks, then throw away your operating
system.

Not necessarily, just look at the bonnie++ tests. The tests show that
using compression (with todays hardware) leads to read speeds that are
some FOUR times the physical disk read rate,... 
but you ignore this as you have some strange anti-REISER religion.
Think about it,... read speeds that are some FOUR times the physical
disk read rate,... impossible without the use of compression (or
something similar).

Wow, consider me STILL totally impressed by your AMAZING BIAS.
Would you like to tell me why you are SO BIASED against REISER4?
