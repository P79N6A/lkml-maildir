The theory is quite easy (I am teaching OS since 1993), the practice is
hard.

I asked mainly about shrink_mmap... Is it vague?

I did not find shrink_mmap in any "nice manual". Did you? Every day I am
reading all messages to linux-kernel, I learned a lot but not enough to
hack the buffers/cache functions in the kernel (at least not better than
2.2.8 ;-). I could not find Linux buffers management documentation
although I spent a lot of time. I am _almost_ sure they do not exist.

That's the hard pointer for newbies here...

I just needed something like "if you want to select buffer victims, check
xxxx, if you want cache victims, check yyyy. That's all, perhaps something
like "xxxx and yyyy are called by zzzz when a=b" could help a lot. Just
few lines.
It seems you could provide this pointer...

Don't let me down :-(
