Hi,
this patch makes my system even more responsive,
I applied the patch over 2.6.0-test8-mm1.
I have a Glade v1 project that has these source files among others:
$ ls -l callbacks.[ch] interface.[ch]
-rw-rw-r--    1 zozo     zozo       583241 okt 28 13:06 callbacks.c
-rw-rw-r--    1 zozo     zozo        96592 okt 27 22:54 callbacks.h
-rw-rw-r--    1 zozo     zozo      1090912 okt 27 22:54 interface.c
-rw-rw-r--    1 zozo     zozo         1687 okt 27 22:54 interface.h
That said, among others: the projects is *very* large, and is reasonably
modularised before someone says something silly about my programming
capabilities. :-)
gcc-3.3.2 (latest Fedora packages) goes up 160M+ in memory usage,
For a test run I started mozilla with some very long pages, oowriter,
gedit with the listed files opened and some gnome-terminal and a new project
compile with make -j2 so the callbacks.c and interface.c were compiled
simultaneously.
The system is a dual PIII/500 MHz with 512M RAM, not a speedy machine.
With all these, the system used only ~36M swap. Free memory was about 3-6M
then I exited oowriter. Free mem suddenly went up to 75M+, starting
programs was almost instant.
Definitely a win.
