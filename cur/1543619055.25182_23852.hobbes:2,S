Well, Rik, time to present your algorithm.  I assume it won't reference 
counts on pages, and will do some kind of traversal of the mm tree.  Note 
however, that I did investigate the class of algorithm you are interested in, 
and found only nasty, complex solutions there, with challenging locking 
problems.  (I also looked at a number of possible improvements to virtual 
scanning, as you know, and likewise only found ugly or inadequate solutions.)
Before you sink a lot of time into it though, you might add up the actual 
overhead you're worried about above, and see if it moves the needle in a real 
system.
