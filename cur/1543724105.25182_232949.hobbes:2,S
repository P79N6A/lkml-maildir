THIS is simply a case of the programmer not understanding what NULL 
means.  When I use '0' for a pointer, I know EXACTLY what I mean, and I 
also know when '0' might be ambiguous, and when I don't know what I'm 
allowed to do, then I play it REALLY safe and typecast 0 to exactly the 
pointer type I need.
I suppose it's good form to use the safest syntax in all cases.  Good 
for readability for people who need more redundancy to read the code.
Perhaps the Linux kernel should have a convention where all NULL 
pointers are typecast explicitly.  I can hear the cries of pain already.  :)
