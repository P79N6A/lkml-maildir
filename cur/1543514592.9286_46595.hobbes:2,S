	Hya, in kernel 2.3.X the initialization method is the same of
old kernels like 2.0.X or 2.2.X ??? Correct me if Im wrong, the init
method in kernel 2.2 start at netdevice.h when the int (*init)(struct
device *dev); look if the necessary hardware is present and thus
initializing the device structure.
