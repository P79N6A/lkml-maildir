cvs server: cannot rewrite CVS/Entries.Backup: No space left on device
These are the sort of errors i'm getting from cvs but this is what df -m
tells me on the partition i'm downloading on
/dev/hda4                 6865      4899      1610  76% /
I'm not sure how to test this on a diff program from cvs since it might
have to do something with how cvs goes about creating the files.  Is anyone
aware of a cvs bug?   
cvs version is Concurrent Versions System (CVS) 1.10.8 (client/server)
(packaged in debian woody)
By the way, this is Linux version 2.4.0-test9-vm-OOM  (rik's vm-oom patch
from oct. 6).  This has been up for 6 days 14 hours.  
I dont seem to be getting any out of space errors by any other programs but
considering the uptime of this kernel version, i'm not so sure if it's
entirely a cvs problem since i've cvs'd bigger stuff than star-office and
never got this error.
