I was actually under the impression that OpenAFS had support for byte- 
range locking (as well as lock upgrade/downgrade); though IIRC there  
was some secondary protocol.  That's probably why the support is so  
basic at the moment; David's getting the basics in first and the more  
complicated stuff can come later.
