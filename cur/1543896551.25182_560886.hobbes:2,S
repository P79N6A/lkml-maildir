The main problems are not really hard to fix......
-	Most problems eem to be related to the fact that Linux does not
	use C-99 based types in the kernel and the related type definitions 
	are not written in plain C. This is something that should be fixed
	with a source consolidation program or by defining aliases to 
	C-99 types in case the compiler is not GCC.
-	Other problems are caused by additional tag definitions that could
	be disabled in case of a non-GCC compile.
