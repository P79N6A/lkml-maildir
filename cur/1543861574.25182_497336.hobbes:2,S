Guess I spoke too soon :(

#uptime
 10:10:12 up 3 days, 22:48,  1 user,  load average: 0.22, 0.19, 0.18
4 am is the lowest load ever, so I don't get it.
I've found two differences with older errors
    SAct is now 0x0 when before was 0x7fffffff
    And the cmd/res used to be really long, now it's just one command
About heavy loading the seagate, I've tested as suggested on other 
thread dd if=<drive> of=/dev/null
for all 4 drives simultaneously, on top of usual load, and all was 
perfect with current kernel (2.6.20-rc3 + blacklist).
Don't know what to do to help
Thanks.
Pablo.
