Ok, that's fair enough. A wrapper module could always be written that then 
in turn invokes user space. That's good enough for me although it makes for 
additional overhead but I guess that is not too bad.

Oh, sure. There are problems. I don't deny that. But I am not too sure that 
those problems outweigh the problems created by putting in huge amounts of 
code into the kernel which could live outside it just as well. - IMHO the 
kernel should be as small as possible rather than contain everything under 
the sun just because it's easier to do that way...
Best regards,
