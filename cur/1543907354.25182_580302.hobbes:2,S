Note that we've had a similar change in our kernel, and we've had to
revert it since the effect on fragmentation is just horrendous.  Without
this, we could run a complete gcc testsuite on the board; with it we'd
run out of high-order pages somewhere in the middle.
This probably wants to be dependent on something like MAP_TRIM_EXCESS.
