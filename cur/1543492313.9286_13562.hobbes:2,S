I have been looking into the current situation for UID limits on Linux. 
The whole reason this comes up is due to the fact that the master NIS
server is serving out UIDs over 3000000 and linux seems to top out at
65535, which I assume boils down to either an unsigned int verses a
signed int or something to that effect.  Has any thought been given
about changing this to make Linux more easily integrade with other unix
system?  Thanks.
