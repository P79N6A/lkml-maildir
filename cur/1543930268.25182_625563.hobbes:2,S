I was looking for an easy semaphore I could convert to a mutex, and I
ran into one that was widely spread and interesting, and which seemed
quite doable at first sight.
So, I started working on it, but was forgotten this discussion, (until
Daniel made me remember it this afternoon). So, I (stupid me ;-) )
tried to convert dev->sem...
After doing the monkey part of the conversion I can boot the kernel
completely on X86 and ARM, and everything works fine, except after
enabling lockdep, lockdep starts complaining...
Is this the problem you were pointing at?

other info that might help us debug this:

I tried debugging it, and I have not found a recursive mutex locking
so far, only locking of 2 different mutexes in a row prior to this
warning, which IMO should be valid.
What is your opinion?
BTW: I attached my patch for dev->sem as I have it now, that generates
this lockdep warning ( for if you want to look at it yourself also, so
you do not have to do the monkey part yourself anymore ;-)
Kind Regards,
Remy
