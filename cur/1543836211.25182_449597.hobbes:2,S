Subject: [GIT PATCH] USB fixes for 2.6.18-rc3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/2/307

Here are a some fixes for USB against 2.6.18-rc1.  They do the
following:
	- revert the two USB patches that forced people to upgrade udev
	  to a newer version than specified in Documentation/Changes
	- removed the anydata driver, as the option driver does
	  everything it did already, and it's supported by an active
	  developer
	- lots of device id updates
	- some documentation fixes
	- lots of bugfixes (most minor, but a few are big enough to have
	  been reported.)
Some of these changes have been in the -mm tree for a while.
Please pull from:
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-usb-devel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
