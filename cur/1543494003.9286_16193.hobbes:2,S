Subject: support for PCMCIA MPEG ZV card

a colleague of mine here at U-M is working on secure videoconferencing.
he's just begun porting his work to Linux and FreeBSD.
it would be a big help if there was an easy portable hardware approach to
MPEG-1 decoding.  he's found a PCMCIA card called "Scenic Wonder" (maybe
also known as Kingston) that is supported on Win98.
does anyone know if there are Linux drivers for this card?  if not, is
someone working on it?  are there other PCMCIA cards that might be better?
any help, advice, or redirects appreciated.
