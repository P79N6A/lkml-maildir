No, but feel free to use the dpfp wiki if you want to start one.

You are asking this because its usability is questionable?
Before you start on any of the more advanced code such as unified API 
and fingerprint recognition, you need the basic device support in place. 
The idmouse driver does this.
Greg is particularly keen on including semi-working driver code in the 
Linux kernel even if there is no complete picture, because it really 
raises awareness and development efforts. After all, if idmouse wasn't 
included because it doesn't form a complete fingerprint login system, 
I'd probably have never heard of it and would have no clue about it's 
capabilities.
