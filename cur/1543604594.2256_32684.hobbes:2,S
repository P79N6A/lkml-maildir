If all you want to know is whether modules are maintained or not, look to 
see how many have had MODULE_LICENSE(sic) tags added. 
Just change the default to no exported symbols, and a single depmod pass
will tell you what broke because it's no longer exporting symbols which are
required by something else. There's no need to add the EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS
cruft all over the place.
Adding EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS to those modules which don't need to export 
symbols doesn't make your task any easier - so please don't do it. Let's 
kill EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS altogether.
