Only if you enabled force feedback for HID devices in your menuconfig. And 
if you did so, it perfectly makes sense that the force-feedback input 
module must be loaded.

1) what strange distro/environment do you use that the usbhid driver is 
   not loaded automatically when you plug the keyboard in?
2) even if your module autoloading is that much broken, you can always ssh 
   to the box or attach PS/2 keyboard and modprobe usbhid ... that works 
   no matter which directory keeps the driver
There is nothing to be documented there, we don't document which directory 
holds which driver.
