Oh, I see what you mean. I think we're much better off sticking the mechanism
for autotuning stuff in the kernel - if we want to feed in policy from 
userspace (which 99.9% of people will never do), it can be through such
things as /proc/sys/vm/swapiness ... that could just fix them statically
if people insisted on such things. 
Having the kernel do something sensible by default is what we aim for ...
overrides still are possible if the sysadmin really thinks they're smarter ;-)
