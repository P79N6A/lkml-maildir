Could you share the reasoning that led to that preference?
Unfortunately we don't seem to be converging on one choice of location.
On one side there is the fact that the .h files are not used outside
of drivers/infiniband -- hence they should stay under drivers/infiniband.
On the other side is the fact that moving the includes under include/
gets rid of some CFLAGS lines in the Makefile.
I don't see a conclusive reason to choose any particular place.
Perhaps Linus or Andrew can simply hand down an authoritative answer?
Thanks,
  Roland
