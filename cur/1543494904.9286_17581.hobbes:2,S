I released now a 2.2.7_andrea7.bz2. The only difference is that I added a
safety path for disable_irq() (I checked in the diff I posted to the list
some hour ago). basically if you are trying 2.2.7_andrea6 you _don't_ need
to try also 2.2.7_andrea7.
I also forgot to tell that starting from 2.2.7_andrea6 I also merged a
lp.c patch deveoped Tim Waugh, that I agree with and that may fix problems
for people who had lp troubles in the 2.2.x cycles for
LP_CAREFUL/LP_SELECTP issues.
