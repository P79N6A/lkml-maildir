Wasn't there a thread a few years ago (3-5?) about sound mixing in the
kernel?
I've tried searching for it but have been unsuccessful so I could be
remembering wrong.
I can't remember if it was about OSS, ALSA or anything else but I
believe the conclusion was that sound mixing does NOT belong in the
kernel and SHOULD be done in userspace. I have a faint memory of that
being written by Alan Cox, but since it was a while ago I could very
well be mistaken there (too?).
