Hello,
As a sequel to my patch "Wistron button support for TravelMate 610" of 
last week, here is a bigger addition of keymaps for the wistron_btns.
Patch 1 adds all the database of acerhk which fits this driver (about 25 
more laptops).
Patch 2 adds a generic map that should fit most users but has the 
disadvantage of not being automatic.
Dmitry, I've tried to make them against your tree. Still, if they don't 
apply cleanly, just tell me and I'll try harder!
See you,
Eric
