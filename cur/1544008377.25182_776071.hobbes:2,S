We at least need a unified place for drivers, or unified support for
those drivers that must be put in userspace, a la usbfs and libusb.

Agreed. And we need to make sure the discussion part actually happens
because once a decision is made, it's hard to correct bad choices.
I would think that an input layer extension would be best because,
e.g. Apple remotes are changed around all the time and, while
functioning the same and having the same form, they send very very
slightly different codes, and I think we would want a way to keep this
really flexible so we just update a quirks table or something to that
effect. I don't know if we're already trying to do that (if we are,
hooray, I'll go away now) but I think it's a good idea.

One way or a hybrid way to address everyone's concerns. I don't see
why this has to be ALL kernel or ALL userspace. I would think it could
be both and still be clean.
