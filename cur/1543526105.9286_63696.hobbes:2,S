Wrong.
What full path? There can be many. Or none. It could be deleted right after
it starts up.
There is no such thing as "the path to the current executable" in Unix.
(In Linux 2.2 and up, readlink(/proc/self/exe) is close)

You should eliminate whatever design flaw you have that causes you to want
this information.

I hope the old BSD/Sysv behavior is considered a bug. It unnecessarily
exposes the difference between an executable in ELF or aout format and an
executable in #! format. argv[0] passed to main() should be the same that was
passed to execve().
