That's definately worth investigating.  If the SAF API is only of interest in
userland, then perhaps a library can translate between the SAF api and the
existing interface cman exports to userland.  We'd welcome efforts to make cman
itself more compatible with SAF, too.  We're not very familiar with it, though.

Sure, we're happy to help make this code more useful to others.  We wrote this
for a very immediate and practical reason of course -- to support gfs, clvm,
dlm, etc, but always expected it would be used more broadly.  We've not done a
lot of work with it lately since as I mentioned it was begun years ago.
