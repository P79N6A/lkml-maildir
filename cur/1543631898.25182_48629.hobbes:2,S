Do you got any numbers that state that it's processing overhead, and not
HW latency that is the bulk of interrupt service time? Just curious,
I've been looking and can't find this "perceived fact" backed up by
facts anywhere. 
BTW: according to "IA-32 Intel Arch. Software Developer's Man Vol 3"
both P3 and P4 the APIC bus is three wire, two data and one clock.
