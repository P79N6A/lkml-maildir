fortune.  It is clearly artificial and it's results prove high
intelligence sometimes. ;)

Fair enough.

The main argument is that you are already "this close" to the limit
and future code changes (in reiserfs or in unrelated functions called
before or after reiserfs) will blow said limit.
Since reiser3 won't get many changes anymore and other code should
generally get enhanced, rather than degraded, you should be pretty
safe.
Is there a simple way to tell reiser3 functions from reiser4, btw?
Something similar to ext2/ext3 would be nice.
