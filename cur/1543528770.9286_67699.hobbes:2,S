Yet another maintenance update:
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/bootimg-7.tar.gz
Cleans up the CONFIG_BOOTIMG_SMP option a little, and fixes a rather
embarrassing collection of bugs in the ELF loader (it mis-loaded some
sections and promptly crashed - amazingly just not all the time).
There is still an unresolved problem with interrupts, which seem to
be unavailable after booting with bootimg in some cases, leading to
nice effects like the bogoMIPS calibration loop not stopping.
The patch is still for plain 2.3.48. It may conflict with my "huge
kernel" patch, because they change neighbouring regions in
kernel/head.S. I'll make an update when Linus releases a kernel
with the huge kernel stuff fixed.
Also note that initrd support in bootimg is still fairly horrible and
quite untested. Also for this, I'm postponing any real work until
there is an "official" kernel with the initrd fix that's been
floating around on linux-kernel.
