That's "barely" supported ... disabled by default, hard to
turn on, rarely (if ever) used, and so on.

That'd go more smoothly if we first made the "easier" wake
event support work properly.  After all, that's basically
just making code that's been there for years always kick
in during system sleep transitions, and helping to make sure
the relevant drivers know how to use it ...

It's set by that HCD as it initializes, because ACPI still
doesn't do so.  There are hardware flags the BIOS sets and
the HCD sees, which in this case partially make up for the
weak support from ACPI.
And it's not specific to PME#, except with EHCI.  With
OHCI for example those flags get set with "legacy" PCI
power management too.

And the /proc/acpi/wakeup stuff needs to go away, in favor
of standard driver model mechanisms that (a) aren't specific
to ACPI, and (b) don't default to "off, and hard to turn on".
Note that on at least some systems it seems that the ACPI bits
aren't entirely necessary.  When the driver enables PCI wakeup
mechanisms, the hardware reacts well enough to wake the system
even if ACPI has not *also* told it do do so.  (Of course it'd
be better if there were no issues about whether ACPI has been
appropriately stroked.)

Why?  "Just because" or is there a real need it would address?

If ACPI-specific state like that "should" be exported, it should
be in an ACPI-specific portion of the tree.  And as for that link,
I'm still not clear on why the patch in
   
http://marc.info/?l=linux-acpi&m=120500563430488&w=2
still hasn't merged ... that provides the relevant linkage in
as neutral a way as possible.
