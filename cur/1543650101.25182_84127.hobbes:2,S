The name in parentheses after the list.  Posted to linux-kernel with some kind 
of note saying "I want this in 2.5".  I've been trying not to make too many 
judgement calls about the patches themselves.  (I know that bloats the list a 
bit, but I'm only maintaining it for another day at most, probably less.)

He'll do that anyway.  I'm just trying to put together a list so he can 
explicitly turn everything he doesn't want down rather than just losing it in 
the suffle.
I'd be amazed if even half of this list makes it in.  It's quite possible none 
of it will.
