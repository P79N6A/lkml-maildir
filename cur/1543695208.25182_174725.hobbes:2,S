Two words:  "fork bomb".  Known problem since Ritchie, Kernighan, and
Thompson were coding the fork() syscall 30 years ago.
'man ulimit' and look at 'max user processes' (-u).
And before anybody flames about why this is the default value for that ulimit,
ask yourself "what value should be used by default instead?" and be prepared to
justify your answer.
