No need for a full compile, just the offending driver. IF and WHEN it
happens. Till then, why bother?

If each time you install $distro you have to get compiler, linker, Python,
and whatnot up and running; and then have to wait a half hour or so for the
standard distributed kernel to compile, I don't see the point. Its much
easier/faster/secure to just distribute and install binaries.
