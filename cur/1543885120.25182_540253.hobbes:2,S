I've been seeing a similar issue, but with a few differences.
I'm running 2.6.21.1 on the same CPU as yourself:
longhaul: VIA C3 'Nehemiah C' [C5P] CPU detected.  Powersaver supported.
longhaul: Using ACPI support.
It seems that longhaul on my system is 'using ACPI support' whereas on yours 
it is 'using northbridge support'. I'm getting lockups after approx. 2-3 
hours using the ondemand governor. It has no problem changing the clock 
speed, and runs at the minimum speed most of the time.
I seem to recall that I get an oops when my system locks-up (the system runs 
headless normally, so it isn't easy to check). I'll investigate.
Regards,
David.
