yes, that's because you didn't applied vm-tweaks-1 yet and you didn't
enough ram and you needed to swap.

it didn't happen here but let's look into it.

I've a few ideas on what to change incrementally to vm-tweaks-1, but can
you send me the `vmstat 1` output, plus also the /proc/meminfo output
snapshotted at regular intervals while xmms is "stuttering" just to
avoid looking at the wrong place? thanks,
Andrea
