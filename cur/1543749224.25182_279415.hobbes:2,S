I think Michael's patch is best (but I'm probably biased) because it addresses
the independent problem of a race in unregister_ioctl32_conversion() too
(and some other smaller issues in ioctl 32bit emulation)
Andrew, could we replace unlocked_ioctl.patch with Michael's patch? Adapting
depending code should be very easy, since only the name of the function
vector has changed.
