Just to say that this bug still exists in CML2 1.1.1 but it is sometimes 
hidden, i.e. you only see a "Y" on one of the options but when you select 
another option, it sometimes says that TWO other options were set to "n" 
implying that two options were Y before... I also still see random two 
options being Y when playing with Pentium Classic selection (right now I 
see Pentium Classic and Pentium-4 at the same time being Y on my screen)...
Hope this helps,
