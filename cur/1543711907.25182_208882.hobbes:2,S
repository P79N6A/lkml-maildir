OK, so you have an error condition on your CD. Does it prevent suspend from
completing? If not then I probably would not care about it till later when
I see it in syslog... I remember that the one thing that Pat complained
most often is your love for "panic"ing instead of trying to recover. In that
case you understandably want as many preceding messages as possible left
intact on the screen to diagnose the problem. If error recovery is ever done
then some eye-candy probably won't hurt.
Also, if we leave swsusp and suspending alone for a second, I could have
'top' running on console overwriting the very same messages. Should we ban
top?
If error reporting is so important for a box it probably:
- has many more means to notify operator;
- has all eye-candy turned off;
- is not getting suspended anyway.
IOW it's most likely a server running 24/7.
