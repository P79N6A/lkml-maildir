In drivers/acpi/Config.in in 2.5.44:
<--   snip  -->
...
if [ "$CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY" != "y" ]; then
   bool     '  Sleep States' CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP
...
   define_bool CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP $CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
...
fi
...
<--  snip  -->
This double definition was at least confusing, a simple
  dep_bool '  Sleep States' CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP $CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
would have expressed it better.
The transition to the new kconfig converted this confusing Config.in 
snipped to the following code in drivers/acpi/Kconfig:
<--  snip  -->
...
config ACPI_SLEEP
        bool "Sleep States"
        depends on X86 && ACPI && !ACPI_HT_ONLY
        default SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
...
<--  snip  -->
The following patch makes it work the way it was intended:

 	  This option adds support for ACPI suspend states. 
Another thing that seems to be suboptimal is that the question for 
SOFTWARE_SUSPEND comes _after_ the question for ACPI_SLEEP, IOW someone 
doing a "make config" to configure his kernel doesn't have a chance to 
select ACPI_SLEEP. To fix this (and it seems to be logical) the 
SOFTWARE_SUSPEND question should be moved to the "Power management 
options" menu. The patch below tries to solve this and it makes ACPI 
dependant on PM as the comments in PM indicate:
- move "Software Suspend" to the "Power management options" menu above
  the ACPI entry
- let ACPI depend on PM
Any comments on this patch?
