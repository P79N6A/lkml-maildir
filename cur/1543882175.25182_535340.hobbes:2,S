   Hm, I'm only seeing clamping to the smallest of 64 and pcibios_max_latency (255) in arch/i386/pci/i386.c if the latency value is too low... Which arch are you using?

   Not sure -- seems likely that it's the chip's own enforced minimum instead...

   More like it.  Although HighPoint's own drivers force 64.

   Not likely since the value is too "special"...
