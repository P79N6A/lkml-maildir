Subject: [PATCH] Needed to get 2.5.7 to compile and link on Alpha [4/10]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Needed to link.  I'm not sure if check_pgt_cache should be a NOP on the
Alpha but most the rest of the functions in pgalloc.h are, and it seems
to work for me.  But someone who really knows what they are doing should
check it.
