OK.  Just for reference here's what people on the JACK list reported:
2.6.14-rt13, PREEMPT_RT, Athlon X2 4400+ (dual core)
rdtsc: 10000 calls in 68 usecs
gettimeofday: 10000 calls in 5170 usecs
P4@3.3Ghz/HT (OpenSUSE 10.0 2.6.13-15-smp):
rdtsc: 10000 calls in 253 usecs
gettimeofday: 10000 calls in 26547 usecs

Yes, I am.  So it sounds like vsyscall gettimeofday for i386 is in the
works?
