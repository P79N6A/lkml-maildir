Well, let's take some (exotic :-) examples:
  - 1989: Amiga 500, 7.14 MHz 68000, expensive SCSI disk, 675 KB/s
  - 1992: Amiga 4000, 25 MHz 68040, IDE, 1.8 MB/s (SCSI with 5 MB/s should have
    been possible)
  - 1998: CHRP, 200 MHz 604e, UW-SCSI, 17 MB/s
The third CPU is ca. 25 times faster than the second (both in BogoMIPS as
kernel cross-compiles). The disk isn't 25 faster, though.
Now you can buy a machine with a CPU that's 25 times faster again, but please
show me a 400 MB/s disk...
