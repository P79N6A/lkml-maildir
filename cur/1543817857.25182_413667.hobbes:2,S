The Coverity checker found this case where the variable "tmp" is used 
uninitialized:
<--  snip  -->
...
static int bcm43xx_pctl_clockfreqlimit(struct bcm43xx_private *bcm,
                                       int get_max)
{
        int limit = 0;
        int divisor;
        int selection;
        int err;
        u32 tmp;
        struct bcm43xx_coreinfo *old_core;
        if (!(bcm->chipcommon_capabilities & BCM43xx_CAPABILITIES_PCTL))
                goto out;
        old_core = bcm->current_core;
        err = bcm43xx_switch_core(bcm, &bcm->core_chipcommon);
        if (err)
                goto out;
        if (bcm->current_core->rev < 6) {
...
        } else if (bcm->current_core->rev < 10) {
                selection = (tmp & 0x07);
...
<--  snip  -->

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
