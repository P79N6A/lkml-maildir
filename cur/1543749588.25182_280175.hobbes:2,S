Enabling CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB actually disables usb-storage from attaching to
certain devices, regardless of what's loaded or not.
I, personally, don't like this.  But I wasn't consulted on that particular
feature.  I'm given to understand that some bad things can happen when two
drivers can bind to the same device, but I haven't had time to experiment
with it.
I can tell you that this has turned into the single largest source of bug
reports/complaints about usb-storage.  Something has to be done.  I just
don't know what.
