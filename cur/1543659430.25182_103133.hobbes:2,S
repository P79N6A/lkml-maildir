It looks like there is a missing scsi_set_device() call in scsiglue.c,
(similiar to what happens if we handled NULL dev pointer in scis_add_host)
so all the usb scsi devices end up under /sysfs/devices.
I don't have any usb mass storage devices, this patch against 2.5 bk
compiles but otherwise is not tested. It should put the usb-scsi mass
storage devices below the usb sysfs dev (I assume in your case under
/sysfs/devices/pci0/00:07.2/usb1/1-2/1-2.4/1-2.4.4).
Maybe Matthew or Greg can comment.
