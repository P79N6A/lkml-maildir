Hello.

So do_IRQ() can start with preempt_count == 0.
Suppose another cpu sets TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag
at the same time.
spin_lock(&desc->lock) sets preempt_count == 1.
Before calling handle_IRQ_event() (which adds IRQ_OFFSET
to preempt_count), do_IRQ() does spin_unlock(&desc->lock)
and falls into schedule().
Am I missed something?
It seems to me that call to irq_enter() must be shifted
from handle_IRQ_event() to do_IRQ().
Oleg.
