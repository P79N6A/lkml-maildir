sata_nv: delay on switching between NCQ and non-NCQ commands
This patch appears to solve some problems with commands timing out in
cases where an NCQ command is immediately followed by a non-NCQ command
(or possibly vice versa). This is a rather ugly solution, but until we
know more about why this is needed, this is about all we can do.
