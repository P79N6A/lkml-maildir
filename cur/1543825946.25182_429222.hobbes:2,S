Can you describe your hardware a bit more?  (and send xfs_info
output too please).

Ehrm, hmm, that smells fishy... does this device have a write
cache enabled by any chance?

Oh, thats bad, all bets are off then - you really cant go doing
that routinely, thats an "in emergency only" big red button -
it throws away the contents of the journal, and will pretty much
guarantee filesystem corruption.
But, it sounds alot like you may have a big hardware reliability
issue there, which is going to make it difficult to distinguish
any software problems.  However, if you find a way to reproduce
that quota accounting problem (above), I'm all ears.
cheers.
