how exactly does it use DMA - how does it allocate the memory it later 
on DMAs into, and how does it typically program that DMA target - is 
there any control over that in the NDIS protocol - or will NDIS drivers 
just write random addresses to the mmio space and then the hardware does 
DMA to/from those addresses? [without the NDIS framework having any 
knowledge about the encoding of those bits?]
on modern hardware it might even be possible to jail an ndiswrapper 
driver to its own pages via the IOMMU.
