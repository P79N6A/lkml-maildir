Subject: Evil bug in netfilter/kernel 2.4.x?

"As a secondary note, if you use connection tracking you will not see 
any fragmented packets, since they are dealt with before hitting any 
chain or table in iptables."
PROBLEM:
root@p300:/etc/rc.d# iptables -t filter -I INPUT -f -j LOG --log-level 3 
--log-prefix "FRAG: "
root@p300:/etc/rc.d# iptables -I INPUT -f -j LOG --log-level 3 
--log-prefix "FRAG: "
root@p300:/etc/rc.d# iptables -I INPUT -f -j LOG --log-level 3 
--log-prefix "FRAG: "
root@p300:/etc/rc.d# iptables -I INPUT -f -j DROP
I've tried all of these, each one by itself.
However, when I run tcpdump, I can clearly see these are not getting 
dropped or logged by the kernel.
I like conn_track for DCC/FTP connections, however, to get logging & 
dropping of fragmented packets working properly, I must recompile 
without the conn_tracker's?
Wouldn't this be considered as a bug?  Someone could be 
pounding/scanning you with fragmented packets, and you would never see 
it, as many people run the DCC and/or FTP connection trackers!

947 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
Is it possible in anyway to log/drop/match fragmented packets with 
connection tracking turned on?
