I get what you're saying. :)
However, doing so achieves two goals:
    - I want kernelspace to provide mechanism, and let userspace define 
policy. In this case, the policy is even finer grained than what we had 
before and can be set at trigger time, rather than at initscript start time.
    - I want to get rid of the old ioctl poll interface that didn't work 
in namespaces.
The namespace problem effectively limits what we can do in userspace to 
simply prodding the kernel to tell _it_ to unmount stuff.  A daemon 
alone cannot unmount across namespaces. 
I hope this clarifies where I stand :)
