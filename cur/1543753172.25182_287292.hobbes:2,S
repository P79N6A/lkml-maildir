Subject: [2.6 patch] fix placement of static inline in nfsd.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/17/69

The patch fixes a bunch of warnings like these 
include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h:137: warning: `inline' is not at beginning of declaration
include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h:138: warning: `inline' is not at beginning of declaration
include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h:139: warning: `inline' is not at beginning of declaration
include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h:140: warning: `inline' is not at beginning of declaration
and these
include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h:137: warning: `static' is not at beginning of declaration
include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h:138: warning: `static' is not at beginning of declaration
include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h:139: warning: `static' is not at beginning of declaration
include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h:140: warning: `static' is not at beginning of declaration
when building with gcc -W
True, that's not how most people build, but some of us do in order to try 
and find potential trouble spots, and the less warnings we have to go 
through the better - especially when they can be cleaned up nice and safe 
with no real impact to the code like these ones.
Please apply.
