It's really none of my business, I'm merely the reporter the
deadlock being fixed, and I don't know my way around sysfs at all ...
... but I have to say I share your discomfort with Alan's
"sysfs_access_in_other_task" naming, it sounded very weird to me.
Quite apart from this mysterious "other task", I don't understand
"access" either.
Perhaps "defer" would best capture the idea of another-task and
maybe-delay?  sysfs_defer_work(), struct sysfs_deferred_work?
