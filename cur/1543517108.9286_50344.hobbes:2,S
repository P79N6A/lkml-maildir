Yeah, right - and we all know that BIOS writers would _never_ violate the 
specs, would they? ESPECIALLY for setting up PCI devices.
Sounds like it might be time for separating CONFIG_APIC from CONFIG_SMP.
I'd do it if I had the time at the moment - perhaps it's time to follow

things like that all day, rather than only half :)
