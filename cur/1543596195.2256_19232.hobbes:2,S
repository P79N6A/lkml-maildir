Ok, lemme see if I got this right. What exactly do you mean by 'a normal
user' or a 'nonnetworked machine'. If the machine is non-networked, then
it must be sort of single user. Oh yea, and if someone logs on from your
console, smack them and don't patch the kernel.
Oh yeah, I can imagine a few situations in which this would be necessary.
But if someone you don't trust logs on from your (non-networked) console
and has time to play with it, you're screwed anyway.
Dan.
