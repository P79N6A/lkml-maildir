Hmm, yes, this is a problem in the current SYSEMU interface, if to be used in
this way.

Ok, yes, this is true.
Currently, SYSEMU allows us to switch from SYSEMU to SYSCALL, but the
execution mode for a syscall is determined from which mode was used on
syscall entry; if you use PTRACE_SYSCALL after syscall entry, this syscall is
completed as usual, and next syscall will run as under PTRACE_SYSCALL.
Actually, as a general purpose patch this might be a bit broken, I have to
admit, but it was written for UML's usage at the beginning. On 2.4 it
provided this behaviour automatically, on 2.6 it was fixed to conform to the
same interface.
But I think this is fixable; for the patch itself it should be trivial, the
problem is supporting it in UML: whether the syscall is executed or not, is
determined from the return value of do_syscall_trace(); as easily seen in the
code, the return value is read on syscall entry, and reused even after
running the debugger.
Also, I'm not that happy to change again UML to support yet another
 interface, but if needed it may be done I hope.
I think that this may be basically fixed in UML by using the same syscall
interception even for completing the syscall... at no performance cost.
The only cost would be adding yet another startup test for this new feature -
however, it is greatly outweighted by mainline inclusion.
