That's _also_ not true for remote filesystems.  We can mount the same
filesystem over NFS again without unmounting the old instance.  Always
could.
IMO a part of the problem is that we are mixing "I'm not asking that
to be writable" with "I won't let you write".  The former belongs
to the mounting side, the latter - to filesystem.
Notice that setups along the lines "mount /dev/sda5 read-only on /home/jail/pub
and read-write on /home/ftp/pub" are not that unreasonable, so even for local
filesystems it might make sense.
IOW, I suspect that right solution would have two separate layers -
	* does anyone get write access under that mountpoint? (VFS)
	* is this fs asked to handle write access and had it agreed with that?
(filesystem)
