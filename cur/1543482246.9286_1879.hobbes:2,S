The Single Unix v2 specs says:
The pread() function will fail, and the file pointer remains unchanged,
if: 
    [EOVERFLOW]
        The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to read or
        write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the file. 
The "offset maximum associated with the file" is the fancy way of saying
"current size of the file". Or, more precisely, (I assume) one is just
being careful in case in the future one will be able to read beyond the
end of file (e.g. to get a user-defined comments about the file, like "I
looked at this file and, behold, it was good!") but the Single UNIX v2
spec won't need modifying, just the term "offset maximum associated with
the file".
However, I think there is a typo in OpenGroup's document, where it says
"read or write" for indeed there is nothing wrong with writing beyond the
end of file, only reading is an abomination... Also, write(2)'s page does
not say that pwrite() should fail to write beyond the end of file.
