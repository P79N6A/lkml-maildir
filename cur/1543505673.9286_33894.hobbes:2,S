DVD on linux has been starting to heat up a bit in the last few months.
Here are two projects currently underway (there are a few others as well):
http://livid.on.openprojects.net
http://linuxdvd.corepower.com
Right now there is some effort going into REing the CSS encryption
employed by the DVD standard. Next on the list is a fast software
MPEG-2 video decoder. There's a _lot_ of work yet to be done.
cheers,
aaron
