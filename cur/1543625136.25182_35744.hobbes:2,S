Hi,
Is it possible to change the packet (add an extra ip header)
and send it back to network bypassing the routing functionality.
I want to do my own routing.( I add the hardware address of the destination machine)
thanks,
Hari.

Write a netfilter module and bind it in to NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING or NF_IP_LOCAL_IN
as appropriate.  This will allow you to analyze the packet and decide whether to
keep or discard it (or mangle it if you want).
This is what netfilter is there for.
