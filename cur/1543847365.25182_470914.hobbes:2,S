I think John's plan, and my plan, is to move the generic time bits, plus
the timekeeping specific clocksource stuff, into a different file.
kernel/timer.c shouldn't have that stuff anyway. That's about 250 lines,
the part of that which is due to the clocksource is about 100 lines.
Are you thinking that this interface is only likely to have one or two
users?
