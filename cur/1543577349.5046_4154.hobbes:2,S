Going through your README, you seem much more
advanced than this simple patch.

Agreed.
Right now I will be interested to run some benchmarks (latency but
also performance) to see how the system is disturbed by beeing

Do you have any pointers on benchmark suites I could run ?
Also, maybe it's a off topic subject now....
