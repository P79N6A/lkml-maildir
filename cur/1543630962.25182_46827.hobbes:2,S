Even more interesting is that the AMD audio is also a clone of the i810.
So that makes the AMD audio and AMD ide apparently match the Nvidia audio
and Nvidia ide (minus the Nvidia extra 'media controller')
Unfortunately the AMD PCnetXX ethernet doesn't match up with the amount
of I/O space their ethernet has.
