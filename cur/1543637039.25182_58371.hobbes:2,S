I am glad you brought this up. I'd love to have a generic callback for this.
AIX used/has a process change handler that is being called on start/exit.
In Linux, this idea could be done through a generic hook settable through a 
module... that should be sufficient and would allow for other stuff to 
be handled as well. For instance in the presence of fast user level
communication (e.g. user mapped windows to myrinet the current
process could be marked in the communication adapter).
Just thinking loud.
