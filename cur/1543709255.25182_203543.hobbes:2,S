Two other things about this release that Kay just reminded me about:
	- if you have been using the tarballs, please delete
	  /sbin/udevinfo by hand, as it is now placed in
	  /usr/bin/udevinfo.  Users who use the rpm or some other kind
	  of package system will have no problems with this.
	- the old style %2c format has now been removed in favor of the
	  %c{2} style.  Any old udev.rules files will need to be
	  converted (you had a few releases to do this...)
	  
And another one I just remembered:
	- we now support multiple symlink rules.  They aren't really
	  documented well, but hopefully the author of that patch will
	  fix this soon...
thanks,
greg k-h
