As a note, the package sysfsutils that contains libsysfs installs the headers 
into /usr/include/sysfs. Are we going to have conflicts since udev has its 
own private libsysfs statically included? Should the extra programs build off 
udev's libsysfs, since they are included with the package? Or, should they 
require a shared libsysfs from sysfsutils? If udev is to have its own static 
edition of libsysfs, perhaps it'd be best if it didn't install headers and 
the extras either used its static version or required the shared libsysfs to 
be installed.
Thanks,
Dan
