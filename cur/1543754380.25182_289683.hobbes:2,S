I'm very sorry, you're completely right. That version uses
skb_copy_datagram_iovec. I'll file a bug for gentoo instead, that it needs to
update from 88 to 89.
On the other hand, though, I would think it would be a good idea to leave this
function in until after 2.6.11, so that distributions and people have plenty of
time to update their vmware. After all, it's not like we'd be missing out on an
important fix or something; we're just moving a couple of bytes out of the
kernel into vmnet.
