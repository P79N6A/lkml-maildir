Not for the same unit of work. If you just run endless loops you 
might be true, but most systems don't do that. 
In terms of laptops (or rather in most other systems too) you usually care 
about battery life time while the system is mostly idling (waiting
for your key strokes etc.). In this case enabling throttling
as a cpufreq driver will not make your battery last longer.
Also skipping the clocks does not actually safe all very much power
compared to the other measures C-states or speedstep do (like dropping voltage) 
This means enabling it will likely make your laptop battery last shorter.
