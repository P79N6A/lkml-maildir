Just noticed: you can drop them (except the first, which is a nice cleanup).
set_pte handles that, and include/asm-generic/pgtable.h uses coherently 
set_pte_at. I've checked UML by examining "grep pte", and either mk_pte or 
set_pte are used.
Exceptions: fixaddr_user_init (but that should be ok as we shouldn't map it 
actually), pte_modify() (which handles that only for present pages).
But pte_modify is used with set_pte, so probably we could as well drop that 
handling.
Also look, on the "set_pte" theme, at the attached patch. I realized this when 
I needed those lines to work - I was getting a segfault loop.
After using set_pte(), things worked. I have now an almost perfectly working 
implementation of remap_file_pages with protection support.
There will probably be some other things to update, like swapping locations, 
but I can't get this kernel to fail (it's easier to find bugs in the 
test-program, it grew quite complex).
And, I'd like to note, original Ingo's version *DID NOT* work properly (it was 
not safe against swapout, it didn't allow write-protecting a page 
successfully).
I'm going to clean up the code and write changelogs, to send then the patches 
for -mm (hoping the page fault scalability patches don't get in the way).

The PTE returned from handle_mm_fault is already marked as dirty and accessed
if needed.
Also, since this is not set with set_pte() (which sets NEWPAGE and NEWPROT as
needed), this wouldn't work anyway.
