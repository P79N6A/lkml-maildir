hey all,
	my apologies if this has already been answered a million times before or
	is off-topic for this list.
	Does the DPT SmartRAID V (PCI/I2O controller) work with 2.4.0-test*'s
	native I2O stack? I've done a lot of looking around various pages,
	mailing list archives, spoken to DPT etc, and still can't get a straight 
	answer as to wether it currently works or not. I have fopund plenty of
	"oh it broke in version x.x.x but i think maybe it half worked in y.y.y" etc
	but no one will give me a straight answer.
	if it is not currently working, can someone tell me what the current
	driver status is / rough guess at when it may be semi-operational.
cheers...
