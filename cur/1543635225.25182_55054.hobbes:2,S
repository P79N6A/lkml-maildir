I'm not sure what this is related to, but as I'm using a pre10 kernel
from the -aa tree, I thought I'd ask here. 
I'm seeing a constant increase of open files in my Dell 6650 Quad P4
Xeon. Kernel was compiled with gcc 2.96-81 and gcc 3.1. (I haven't
noticed anything major, I was just trying out the -O3 flags with gcc
3.1. No errors to report there.
I'm running an Oracle DB on this box in a test scenario. I've got ~1TB
storage on there..and the DB occupies about 70% of that. About 50% is
data, 30% is index, and the rest is archive, rollback, system, temp,
etc. The problem I have is as follows: 
The DB has been up for about 8 days now...and the open file count has
increased quite a bit. It does not seem to be decreasing though. I've
raised my file-max to 20000, currently cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr shows
about 15400 in use. 
It started out at 8192, then I quickly realized this wouldn't work, and
rose it to 10200, then up to 14400, then to 15500, then 20000. The
latter has been in effect for about 3 hours or so now..and file-nr is
hovering at 15536 or there abouts.
Has anyone seen these symptoms? Below you will find my bdflush
parameters, file-max, and meminfo. If I need to supply more, please ask
and I will give what info I can. I will be trying rc1-aa as well soon.
I was also curious if this was a known issue with the pre10 or
-aa4-Pre10.
