I think you miscalculate, that bus can transfer 532 MB/sec, Gigabit 
Ethernet tops out at 125 MB/sec at absolute maximum and it's difficult 
to achieve that in practice.
And what lspci reports is merely that the device supports 66MHz bus 
speed. That doesn't mean it doesn't support higher speeds and that 
doesn't mean that's what it's running at.
