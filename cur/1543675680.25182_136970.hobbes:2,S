This may just be pedantic minutiae, but aren't those parenthesis around
"error" unnecessary?
Here is a proposal for coding style: Only use parenthesis in the return
statement when needed.
return -ETOSENDERADDRESSUNKNOWN;	/* this is OK */
return (value & ZORRO_MASK);		/* so is this */
return (-ENOTENOUGHCOFFEE);		/* bogus parenthesis */
