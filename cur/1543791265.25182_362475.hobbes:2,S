But get_user_pages() was not invoked by 'the core vm'.  I invoked it, from my
module...  same one which populated this VMA before.

Nope.  We are not having PageReserved() set on our pages since we want them
refcounted.  But old SuSE kernels contained this code which was rather unhappy
if page did not have ->mapping set.  So we just marked vma VM_RESERVED, as it
did not hurt, and all pages in this vma have refcount > 1 anyway so there is no
point in trying to cleanup these page tables.  Now rmap catches this by
page_count() != page_mapcount(), so VM_RESERVED is not needed anymore, but there
did not seem to be any reason to remove it.
         pageable = !PageReserved(new_page);    << pageable = 1
         as = !!new_page->mapping;              << as = 0
         BUG_ON(!pageable && as);
         pageable &= as;                        << pageable = 0
         ...
         /*
          * This is the entry point for memory under VM_RESERVED vmas.
          * That memory will not be tracked by the vm. These aren't
          * real anonymous pages, they're "device" reserved pages instead.
          */
         reserved = !!(vma->vm_flags & VM_RESERVED);  << reserved = 0
         if (unlikely(reserved == pageable))          << fires...
                 printk("Badness in %s at %s:%d\n",
                        __FUNCTION__, __FILE__, __LINE__);
So I've made this change...  Test probably could be for 2.6.4 <= x <= 2.6.5 to 
rule out all buggy kernels, but I'll probably leave it this way unless there is 
some good reason to not set VM_RESERVED on these older kernels.
Thanks for explanation.
