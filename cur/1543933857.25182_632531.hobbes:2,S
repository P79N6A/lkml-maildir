Thanks for the detailed response.
I thought I had gotten to the bottom of my problems when I found that
udev workaround, I guess I was naive.
I did the two tests you described and they predictably caused the hard
hangs. I needed to run the port80 program only once to get the hard
hang.
The output of the dmidecode commands were :
Quanta
30B7
I applied the patch you provided ( luckily I am using 2.6.24-rc6-git3
kernel because I need the b43 driver ), added these values and compiled.
	{
		.callback	= dmi_io_delay_port_alt,
		.ident		= "Compaq Presario v6000",
		.matches	= {
			DMI_MATCH(DMI_BOARD_VENDOR, "Quanta"),
			DMI_MATCH(DMI_BOARD_NAME, "30B7")
		}
	},
I was able to boot without the udev workaround and can now use hwclock
without hanging the system. In dmesg I can see this new line :
