Hi,
I notice the entities in the subject line have appeared in Linux 2.4.
What is their functional specification? I guess they trigger if no bytes
are received/send within a consecutive period. How does the app get the
error? -EPIPE for a blocking read/write? If so, does SIGPIPE
get raised? Or is -ETIMEDOUT used? ...
TIA,
Chris
