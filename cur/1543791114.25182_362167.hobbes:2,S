Something that may help:
The zlib developers take down old versions because they don't want people 
using out of date stuff with known security bugs, but I asked the zlib 
developers nicely if they could put the history up anyway, because busybox 
also contains its own somewhat-shrunk fork of the gzip code, and we want to 
make sure we don't miss any security fixes.  They were nice enough to 
populate "
http://zlib.net/fossils/",
 which you might find useful too.

(Not that I've had time to go through and see what if any security fixes 
relevant to busybox there might be in there yet.  If you find anything 
interesting, could you let me know? :)
