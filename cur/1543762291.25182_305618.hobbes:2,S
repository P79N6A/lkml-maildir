I am now less certain:  I tried with a separate but similar machine, and
eth3 still has bad interrupt test.  I tried 2.6.9 kernel, same problem.
I tried 2.4.29 kernel (on FC2 distribution), and the same problem exists.
I tried with pci=noacpi, and this just messes up everything (irqs are
disabled, etc).
Could this be a bug in the motherboard implementation?
Off to try some different combinations of NIC hardware...
