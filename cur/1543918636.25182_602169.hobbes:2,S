Interesting script - sad how everyone reinvents equivalent things.
I had been experimenting with running the whole lot under Xnest,
with two extra users - one for the Xnest which had the main X
cookie, and another for the browser.  But found that it was just
too awkward (since I use multiple browser windows as well a tabs).
So I ended up trading a small security gain vs usablity.
The other thing I started playing with was the NX version of Xnest,
since it allows for a rootless server...
