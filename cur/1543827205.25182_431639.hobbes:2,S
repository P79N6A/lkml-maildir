Tell the author to do it differently. Drivers have no business
to call in_atomic(). So, he postpones some accesses until later.
This is an easy way out, I did it myself in 2.4's usb-serial,
but it's wrong. I don't see what his excuse is. Mine was that
I didn't want to debug a freaking gazillion of usb-storage
subdrivers.
Who's the guy, anyway? Was it Petkan? I'm sure he'll listen
to reason, I worked with him before.
I'm going to keep an eye on rtl8150 and oppose in_atomic when
it sneaks in.
