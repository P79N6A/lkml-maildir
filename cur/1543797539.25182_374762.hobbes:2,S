The original goal of libsysfs was to have a library that handled all of
the direct sysfs calls, and have it create structures that looked
something like what sysfs exported (devices, busses, etc.)
Then, if things changed in the sysfs layout or structure, only libsysfs
would need to be changed, and all apps that used it would continue to
work just fine.
But in reality, it was only used by udev, and was very fragile.  So
fragile udev is thinking of ripping it out as it has had a lot of
problems in the past.
Hope this explains things better.
thanks,
