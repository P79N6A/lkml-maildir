FWIW, I can easily reproduce this on a Linux 2.6.27-9 (Ubuntu kernel), 
using both forcedeth and tg3 network drivers. It's reassuring to hear of 
this network corruption as I have been puzzling over non-blocking 
splice() code recently!
The corruption does seem to be confined to the user data on the 
connections, as I have been able to run some benchmarks using my own 
splice()-enabled HTTP proxy to transfer lots of data. All the TCP 
connections 'work' fine (as in no broken TCP), the initial HTTP request 
& response headers get through OK, but the body data of the responses 
sometimes gets corrupted. The benchmark seems to work flawlessly until 
you look at the web page data!
I'm happy to run any test code on systems here or provide any debug 
information if it would help to track this down.
