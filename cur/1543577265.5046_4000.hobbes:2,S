Subject: [PATCH] drop-behind fix for generic_file_write
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus, Alan,
the following (trivial) patch fixes drop-behind behaviour
in generic_file_write to only drop fully written pages.
This increases performance in dbench by about 8% (as
measured by Daniel Phillips) and should get rid of the
logfile bottleneck Ingo Molnar found with the drop-behind
call in generic_file_write in TUX tests.
Please apply this (trivial) patch for 2.4.0.
regards,
Rik
