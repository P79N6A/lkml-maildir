Well, strictly speaking, it's all GPL'ed, so Jeff is certainly free to take
the .src.rpm of the RedHat kernel, use rpm2cpio to extract the NPTL patches
from it, and forward port it to the 2.4.NN of his choice...
However, unless you're *really* handy with patch and diff, it's probably
more productive to upgrade to RH EL release 4, which comes with a 2.6 kernel...
(Speaking as somebody with RHEL 3 boxes going to RHEL 4 soon, and boxes that
are 2.6-mm with Fedora patches on top.. both have their place in the greater
scheme of things..)
