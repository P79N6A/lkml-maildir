Binary compatibility to Linux is pretty important for applications.   
Even though Apache is open source, I don't want to recompile it for  
every new Linux kernel.  Fortunately I don't have to, because glibc  
abstracts the Linux kernel interface.  Consider VMI in the same role  
as glibc -- when the hypervisor changes, VMI maintains compatibility  
with your pre-existing infrastructure, while letting you have some of  
the benefits of the new hypervisor.  The upgrade and recompile game  
can quickly end in a stalemate when you have packages with  
conflicting dependencies (one package requires the old version, and  
the other package requires the new version).
