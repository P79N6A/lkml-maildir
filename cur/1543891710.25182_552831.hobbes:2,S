This interacts with the header split function in the hardware.

We should only do aggregation in the driver if this really is a TCP header,
otherwise things will get worse.
You're right, we should at least check that tcph is within the received
frame.

Actually a huge number of back to back frames is what we would want to
receive
at 10 gbit ;-)
How is it possible to figure out if this is what you want or just DoS?
It doesn't change anything compared to a non LRO driver, we process a
certain
maximum amount of frames before waiting for the next interrupt,
the packet filters/DoS should still see all traffic (which is above the
driver).
Any suggestions how to handle this better/different?
