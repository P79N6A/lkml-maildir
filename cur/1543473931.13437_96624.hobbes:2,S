I agree that it would be very nice for fsck to have some kind of logging
mechanism.
Perhaps, if it's being run non-interactively, you could tee the output
to a file?  Maybe have a scratch partition (where nothing of long-term
importance is kept) which is mounted read/write before doing fsck on
any of the rest of your partitions?
That said, getting a UPS to allow for clean shutdowns is probably a better
way to spend your time.  [That said, a UPS won't prevent the kernel from
having problems.]
