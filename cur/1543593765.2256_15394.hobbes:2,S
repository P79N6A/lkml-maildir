	If the rounding errors are less than the accuracy and the
reproducibility of your sensor, and you operate in that range and
depend on those values, then you have no clue where you are, no
matter what your granularity.  You sound like the classic example
of why we should NOT do this.  You are foolish enough to depend on
that precision and think that it's accuracy and think that it means
something in comparision to the identical measurement 15 minutes later.
It does not.

	Then you are being foolish.
	Your sensors are neither accurate to that degree nor are they
reproducible to that degree.  What you are describing is jibberish.
