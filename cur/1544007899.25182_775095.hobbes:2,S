I agree that we were aggressive in shipping this checking in 2.6.28-rc.
The checking has no functional effect, except to issue a console warning,
so I figured it had limited down-side.
It actually paid off almost immediately by pointing out why
a Linux bug was provoked on jejb's test box.
I had figured on making it CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG for the
final release, but at this point we've seen only the
_BIF and _WAK warnings -- and they're both dealt with
via the patches queued for Linus.
So at this point, I'm inclined to keep this checking enabled in
2.6.28-final, independent of CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG.
