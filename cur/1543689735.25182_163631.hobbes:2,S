Well, if I can be naive for a second (and I'll fully admit I don't
understand the implications of this), there are two things here - 
either give it more of a timeslice (bandwidth increase), or make it 
more interactive (latency increase). Those two seem to be separable,
but we don't bother. Seems better to pass a more subtle hint to the
scheduler that this is interactive - nice seems like a very large
brick between the eyes.

OK. So you renice it ... then your two cpu jobs exit, and you kick off
xmms. Every time you waggle a window, X will steal the cpu back from
xmms, and it'll stall, surely? That's what seemed to happen before.
I don't see how you can fix anything by doing static priority alterations
(eg nice), because the workload changes.
I'm probably missing something ... feel free to slap me ;-)
