Could it make sense to keep this in arch specific header files?
So when we fiddle with ARM we do not impact SPARC etc.
And in this way ARCH specific changes are kept in ARCH specific files.
For the "Ignore historical" part this should be in a common file I think.
So in other words:
init/missing_syscalls.h	=> Contains common stuff and include:
include/asm/missing_syscalls.h => contains ARCH specific stuff.
