I think you're overcomplicating the issue.  You certainly don't need any 
3D code to get a star-wars like scroll going.  You can make a 2D 
transform to make the fonts _look_ like they're scrolling out into 
space.  As a matter of fact, wouldn't simply transforming the 
rectangular viewport into a trapezoid do the trick?  You could then 
frame this with a starry bitmap, or whatever.
This doesn't sound like it would require any massive hacking (although 
I'll readily confess that I haven't looked into the code.)
