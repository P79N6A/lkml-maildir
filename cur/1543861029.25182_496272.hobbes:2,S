I wouldn't say "lots of code". I would say "all real projects".
NOBODY will guarantee you that they follow all standards to the letter. 
Some use compiler extensions knowingly, but pretty much _everybody_ ends 
up depending on subtle issues without even realizing it. It's almost 
impossible to write a real program that has no bugs, and if they don't 
show up in testing (because the compiler didn't generate buggy assembly 
code from source code that had the _potential_ for bugs), they often won't 
get fixed.
The kernel does things like compare pointers across objects, and the 
kernel EXPECTS it to work. I seriously doubt that the kernel is even 
unusual in this. The common way to avoid AB-BA deadlocks in any threaded 
code (whether kernel or user space) is to just take two locks in a 
specific order, and the common way to do that for locks of the same type 
is simply to compare the addresses).
The fact that this is "undefined" behaviour matters not a _whit_. Not for 
the kernel, and I bet not for a lot of other applications either.
So "nearly all" is probably _understating_ things rather than overstating 
it as you claim. Anybody who thinks that they have proven the correctness 
of their program is likely lying. It's a good thing if they have _tested_ 
all the code-paths, but they've invariably been tested with a compiler 
that doesn't go out of its way to try to generate "legal but idiotic" 
code. So the testing won't generally find cases where the compiler may 
have been _allowed_ to do something else.
The end result: any nontrivial project always has dodgy code. Because 
people simply don't write perfect code.
Compiler people who don't realize this aren't compiler people. They're 
academics involved with mental masturbation.
