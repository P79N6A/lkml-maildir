Hey and finally if someone want's to use /dev/port for
developement on some slow control experimental hardware for example.
Why doesn't he just delete the - signs at the front lines
of the patch deleting it plus module register/unregister trivia and
compile it as a *separate* character device module ?
That's linux - you have the source, so use it.
You wan't to cheat around the OS abstractions - do it for yourself!
There is no requirement that it has to be
permanently in the mainline kernel where it tends to
attract people who shouldn't have used it in first place
for generic stuff like kbd rate settings and clock device
manipulation.
