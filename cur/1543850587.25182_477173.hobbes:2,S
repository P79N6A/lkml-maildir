    It's what it was doing effectively. And what was wrong was calling ack() 
which OpenPIC driver didn't (and was not obliged to) support.

    Why is that? eoi() is effectively the same as ack() in this case. I must 
note that what's the "standard" 8259 driver is doing in mask_ack() seems 
misleading since it actually masks IRQ and sends EOI there.

    That's effectively the same for OpenPIC. Maybe that implemetation just 
didn't look graceful but it was *correct*. And the current one is at least 
incomplete.
    I can see 3 ways to get out of this situation now:
1. Revert this change and use mask() + eoi() approach suggested by Daniel.
2. Add the ack() handler to OpenPIC driver -- and point it to mpic_eoi().
3. Do the same as x86 APIC driver does and use level/egde flows instead of 
fasteoi for the case when IRQs are threaded -- that ensues doing (2) as well.
    Note that all three aproaches lead to the effectively the same behavior 
WRT OpenPIC (except for the edge-triggered IRQs in 3rd case). Opinions?
