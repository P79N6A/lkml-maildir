Hi there !
This is version 2.4.34-pre4. Very minor fixes as well as a backport of the
fix for CVE-2006-4997 by Dann Frazier.
I'm pretty happy with the gcc4 fixes, a few people reported success and
nobody complained yet. One of the OpenWRT developers offered to contribute
MIPS patches from his project, but as I don't have a toolchain anymore, I
will not be able to break them into pieces before merging them. I asked
him to do all the dirty and thankless job, but I don't know if he will
feel brave enough. I might try to perform an Alpha port when I receive
my memory upgrade. If other people want to contribute gcc4 fixes for other
archs, they're welcome, but *please* provide one patch per build error
with the copy of the error in the commit.
I will wait a bit more for fixes and will soon enter -rc as things calm
down. If I find some spare time, I will release 2.4.33.4 with minor fixes,
and even possibly resync the hotfix tree for users of older versions.
Have fun,
Willy
