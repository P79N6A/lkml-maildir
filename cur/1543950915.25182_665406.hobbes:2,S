hm. I think we should not let this much RAM hang around in a 
special-purpose allocator like quicklists. Shouldnt the quicklists be 
temporary in nature, and be trimmed much more agressively?
in fact, we have a check_pgt_cache() call in cpu_idle(), which does:
        quicklist_trim(0, pgd_dtor, 25, 16);
but it appears we dont do quicklist trimming anywhere else! So if a 
system has no idle time, the quicklist can grow unbounded, and that's a 
real memory leak IMO.
