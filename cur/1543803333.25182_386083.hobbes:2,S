No, ieee80211 has always been intended for use by all drivers.
Read the archives... there have been a few efforts to start merging
HostAP and ieee80211 code, and further efforts exist out of tree that

Remember Linux's maxim:  do what you must, and no more.
That implies that new users SHOULD update ieee80211 for their needs.
