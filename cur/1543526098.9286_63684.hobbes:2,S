I *really* think this is a mistake for reasons previously explained. 
This should be /dev/microcode or /dev/cpu/microcode (Richard is right,
it should be the latter.)  If we want to virtualize it, it's time to
bite the bullet and make devfs do things right, not kluge it up ad
infinitum by adding hacks to /proc with *NO* permissions or anything...
