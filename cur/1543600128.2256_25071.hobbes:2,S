Because ALSA is not in the kernel tree. ALSA is a completely different
sound system from OSS, and ALSA is not in the tree. Many find ALSA
superior, and suggest it replace OSS. ALSA may find its way into the
tree during 2.5.
Of note, I don't know why SBLive does not work w/o these drivers. SBLive
in the kernel tree is very functional, and the OSS version should work
fine (assuming the game works with OSS).
