One bit? No chance. The same as with ECC RAM - one bit error will always
be detected.

Then you have to abandon using any hard drivers. Or computers at all.
Well, mirrors (with read-and-compare) are probably good enough for you,
but it has to be done at application level.

against _changing_ the problem (it doesn't go away), breaking things
which are now sane.

Then note that a drive can be temporarily unable to read most of the
data - due to, say, incorrect supply voltage or very high level of
electromagnetic interferences.
Would you like to trash _all_ your data in such case automatically?

Do you really not value your data enough to mark it as inaccessible?
If it comes to non-standard recovery then you should rather go for
backups.
