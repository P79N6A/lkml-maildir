OK I guess that rules that out then.

Its just a newer version I haven't released yet. It has a few improvements.

I don't know what it could be if that doesn't work. Sound driver or maybe
some change in 2.6 causing gnomemeeting to do silly things. scheduling
latency is typically very low...
Running a not niced make -j3 bzImage while in X playing a video causes
my (not niced) latency measurement program to average 14us latency,
with 14 samples over 2ms and 136 over 100us out of 145 000 (maximum 7ms).
Running the latency measurement at -10 gives an average of 12us scheduling
latency, with one sample over 100us (305us).
Thats with my scheduler and a PIII-1000. I haven't tried plain 2.6 for a
while, but it wouldn't be much worse (if any). I haven't tried 2.4 either
and I would be surprised if it were any better.
