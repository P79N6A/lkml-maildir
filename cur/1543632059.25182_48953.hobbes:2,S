Greetings,
Using Vojtech's arch/i386/kernel/time.c patch ported to 2.2[1], I recently
got the "via686a" bug check triggered after the machine suspended itself
due low battery, including the following lines grepped and snipped out of
kern.log:
May 28 11:19:49 gull kernel: timer.c: VIA bug check triggered. Value read 65500 [0xffdc], re-read 65486 [0xffce]
May 28 11:19:50 gull kernel: timer.c: VIA bug check triggered. Value read 65500 [0xffdc], re-read 65486 [0xffce]

May 28 11:19:58 gull kernel: timer.c: VIA bug check triggered. Value read 65497 [0xffd9], re-read 65483 [0xffcb]
Anyone got any good theories what's going on here, given that this is a
~1995 vintage laptop with a Pentium-120 (which I'm assured doesn't have a
VIA 686a ;-)?
Thanks,
Neale.
[1] OK, I stuffed part of the porting of Vojtech's patch (revised version
to come Real Soon Now) but that shouldn't affect the validity of the
greppage from kern.log
