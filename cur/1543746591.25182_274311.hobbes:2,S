This is unavoidable.  Two drivers grabbing the same PCI I/O range is
dangerous.
Now that libata supports PATA, it would be easier to let libata support
both SATA and PATA.  Since that is a single driver, it makes DMA easy to
support for both SATA/PATA.
If libata does this, there needs to be a "ide=disable" or
"legacy_ide=libata" switch added somewhere, for the cases (most distros)
where IDE driver is built-in.
