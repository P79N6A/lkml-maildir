Well, I have had the first drive for about a year and a half (I think) 
and the second drive since August. I never had any problems out of them
with the same controller card on my previous motherboard (MSI K7T
Turbo). The problems didn't arise until the other day when I got my new
board.
The errors occur over and over; the drive will come back for a few
seconds and then the error will occur again. I usually reboot at this
point.
