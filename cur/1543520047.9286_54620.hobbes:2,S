You could try some pings with varying packet sizes to see if there is a
packet loss problem (either on the network or in your network card).
I just tried commands like:
  for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ; do ping -s 8192 -c 10 remotehost & done
I got 6 concurrent pings not losing packets, but 7 did - this is from
an 100bT machine to a 10b2 machine.  If you get packets losses with as
few as 3 current pings, then it is probably network problems. If not,
the problem is probably else where.
You could try setting the rsize and wsize on the mount to 1024 to
avoid fragmentation.
