I just investigated the procps issue.  Using init_task as the parent
nothing sticks out as being wrong in /proc.
Further when I modified pstree to accept 0 as it's starting pid (from
which all else would be rooted).  All of the kernel threads showed up.
So if anything I it is a feature that kernel threads don't show up
by default in pstree (when PPID == 0).  It isn't a subtle kernel bug.
