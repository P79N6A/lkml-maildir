See the version I just suggested to Randy for this paragraph.  It's all
I can come up with right now too :)

I always never know when to use a ';', thanks.

Thanks, that was a big miss.

Not really, you never touch the "raw" kset, you only use functions to
create it.  There's nothing in the structure for someone to mess with.

Nope, all you need is 'kobject_put()'  I've already added that change to
the tree, turned out it was already all implemented, all I had to do was
the search-and-replace, thanks to Kay :)
thanks for the review.
