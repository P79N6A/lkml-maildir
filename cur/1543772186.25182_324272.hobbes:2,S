The user code can't assume anything about any memory allocated
by malloc(). The first time a buffer is allocated, it may be
zero-filled because of the zeroed pages allocated by the kernel
when the new break address is set. After that, all bets are off
because once you free a buffer and allocate another one, it
will probably contain data from malloc()'s previous allocation.
Even the very first time malloc() returns a pointer, doesn't
guarantee that the memory will all be cleared. This is because
many malloc()s use just-obtained memory (via brk) to do some
house-keeping which may result in some "strange" numbers in
the memory at some places.
It is extremely bad coding practice to assume a buffer is
zero filled when writing user-mode code. That's why we have
calloc().
