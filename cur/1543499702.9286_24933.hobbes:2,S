Grr... I apologize then for my quite effective display of ignorance :-).
I knew that you could use signals to terminate a program and to tell it
what to do if it has installed a signal handler, but I didn't know that
you could do something as complex as that... I just learned myself that if
you send a signal 2 to mpg123, it will quit the song that it's playing,
and move to the next one.  Heh.  Pretty cool stuff.
