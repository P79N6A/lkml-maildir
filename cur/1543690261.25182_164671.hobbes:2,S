Nope. Without the dev=ATAPI command line I wouldn't have had a clue
what could be wrong.

The message is in because Jörg Schilling doesn't like the current
implementation at all. So he says one shouldn't use it, in order to
'force' kernel developers in another direction, e.g. Jeff Garzik's
libata.

I don't think it is. If you don't find documentation for dev=/dev/hdX
then that's probably because Jörg doesn't want it to be used. I have
not checked myself though.
