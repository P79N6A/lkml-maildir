Why  can't we have some thing like this
1) When OOM  occur send  send a  signal to the process  ,SIG_OOM
2) If the process  ignores kill the process .
3) if the process want to wait for the memory make it wait.
4) if th process urgently need the memory get  the  memory for it by
killing other process( can  be done using Rik's algorithm  + some
modification ) . All these decitiion  are to be done  by the user .
        Now when  killing other process we can use a priority level als
( some one has suggested it before . )
            init and syslog = 20
            root daemons    = 15
            commands run as root = 10
            daemons            = 5
            userlevel            = 0
            cron and at jobs = -5
( These values can be changed   to any apporpriate value )
