Indeed It will take approximately 2 hours for me to have the new X installed and reboot to
use it and get any results.  However, test8-vm3 would be AWESOME if it didn't have that
deadlock that makes it crash after a while.  it seems to be devoid of any of the annoying
problems test9 has.     One thing that seems to be overlooked too and i'm not sure if it's
related or not is my DMA's timeout on test9 ....  this does not occur on test8-vm3.    Well,
i'll get back about the latest xfree86 in about 2 hours .. but if anyone has any other ideas
or info i can give ...it's not problem.  test8 seems stable enough to keep itself up until
i'm ready to reboot.
