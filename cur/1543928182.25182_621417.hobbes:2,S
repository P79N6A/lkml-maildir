No.
I already said I'm not looking at changing the calling convention for 
existing syscalls.  I don't think that makes sense.  (The only realistic 
exception to that is that if we really want a small number (16 or less) 
of flags fully orthogonal to the system call table, I guess it might 
make sense to stuff those in the high bits of the system call register. 
  However, I am a bit concerned about the auditability of that.)

Hardly so, as evidenced by the fact that we have successfully done so 
for 15 years already; a number of Linux architectures require this 
information for the existing system calls.

You *ARE* introducing additional syscall parameters, regardless if 
you're admitting it or not.  It's exactly what you're doing, and by 
making those parameters hidden, all we're accomplishing is:
- a penalty any time those parameters have to be invoked,
- a good possibility that all the combinations are not audited.

We have a ton of examples in the kernel already for both dealing with 
additional parameters and (somewhat fewer examples, but sys_pselect is a 
good one) too many parameters: in all cases, we invoke a wrapper 
function that sets up the parameters and then invokes the "true" syscall 
function.  Right now we're generating those manually, which appears to 
work okay simply because the amount of work it takes is small compared 
to the amount of work it takes to write the code for a proper syscall. 
(That doesn't mean it is the ideal model, of course.)  We *could* 
generate them automatically if we wanted to, with either of the models I 
mentioned -- the code I have in klibc to generate syscall stubs should 
be relatively easily modifiable to do this, although it's probably 
overkill for this job.
In this case we do minimal thunking of parameters for the legacy 
entrypoints, and for the current entrypoints we do the guaranteed 
minimum amount of work.
