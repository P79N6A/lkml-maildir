Yes, I have read them and those of Linus too.
No matter for me. I do not belong to the Minix team. I have been only 
entertaining myself with Minix for a while and I needed to mount it from Linux, 
so I wrote the patch and published it in my page:
http://www.terra.es/personal2/danarag
to help others with the same curiosity. If my patch can bee merged into the 
Linux Kernel mainline, good. If not, also good.
Keep it on the queue if you think it helpful. Otherwise, just drop it out.
