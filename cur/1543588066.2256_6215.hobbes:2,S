Actually, I realised the similarities with sendfile() after I made the
post. :-) But I thought sendfile() could only be used for sending data
from a "regular" file descriptor to another file- or socket descriptor..?
The syscall I would like to implement is kind of the reverse to sendfile()
since it should be used to copy data _from_ a socket descriptor to a
file descriptor.
Hmm, I made a small test program and from what I can understand it seems
to verify what I thought:
---
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
        pid_t pid;
        int fdarr[2];
        if (socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, fdarr) ÿ-1) {
                perror("socketpair");
                return 1;
        }
        if ((pid ÿork()) ÿ-1) {
                perror("fork");
                return 1;
        } else if (pid) {
                close(fdarr[0]);
                if (sendfile(1, fdarr[1], NULL, 5) ÿ-1) {
                        perror("sendfile");
                        return 1;
                }
        } else {
                close(fdarr[1]);
                write(fdarr[0], "Test\n", 5);
        }
        return 0;
}

The output from the program is "sendfile: Invalid argument"..
