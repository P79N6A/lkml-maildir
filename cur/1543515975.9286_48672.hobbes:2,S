here's the current implementation on parisc where we have _only_
load-and-zero, which must surely be the most primitive atomic op.
xchg:
        spin_lock_irqsave(lock, flags);
        temp = *ptr;
        *ptr = x;
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(lock, flags);
(unless you're xchg'ing with a constant zero, in which case we use the
primitive we have.  Most of the xchg's in the kernel use this form.)
um.  no-one's made the test_and_set_bit code atomic yet.  But it's going
to suck worse than this.  If the contention on the xchglock becomes too
great, we can hash on the value of `ptr' and have an array of locks.
ARM has load-and-store, which must be the next most primitive atomic op.
that makes xchg a no-brainer, but test-and-set-bit is quite hard.
I'm having trouble thinking of a design where xchg would be worse
than test-and-phi.
