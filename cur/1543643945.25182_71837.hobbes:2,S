Others have reported probems that normally look something like "it works fine 
for some minutes to days, and then all connectivity stops, till I reboot or 
re-insert the module", but I can't duplicate. Does this match your problem?
There are some races, but I can't explain the problem from them. I do need to 
fix the races, but I only do this when I have some spare time (after work, 
SO, and some other hobbies).

Most people have reported the problem with Via UHCI chipsets, and usb-uhci 
driver. Does this match your configuration?
You might care to upgrade the kernel too.
