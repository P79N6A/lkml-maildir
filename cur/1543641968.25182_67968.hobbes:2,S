I see - yes, that's a good one.
I assumed that I would need to make several VFS operations atomic
or revertable, or simply forbid things like new file allocations or
extensions (i.e.  the above), depending on what is possible or not.
This is precisely the kind of objection that I want to hear about.
OK - reply:
It appears that in order to allocate away free space, one must first
"grab" that free space using a shared lock. That's perfectly feasible.
Thank you.
Where could I intercept the block allocation in VFS?

No, I don't want ANY FS. Thanks, I know about these, but they're not
it. I want support for /any/ FS at all at the VFS level.

I know about that too, but no, I do not want ANY FS, I want /any/ FS.
