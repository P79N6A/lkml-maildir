With the aid of a second program, yes.
For one program: not directly. It's because the EIP changes while you are
calclating it.
You could f.e.:
int main(void) {
    printf("owned\n");
mark:
    printf("pwned\n");
    printf("%p\n", &&mark);
}
GCC specific.
Or you could also poke around with __builtin_return_address, or even peek at
the stack yourself.

No, because that opens a wide door for trojans and stack smashers.

It would not be a thread then.
