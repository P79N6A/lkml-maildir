I wouldn't be surprised if it makes sense to combine some of them.  For
instance, perhaps utsname and networking?

different from what?
Oh, you mean in case we want to allow cloning a namespace outside of
fork *without* cloning the nsproxy struct?

If it is reference counted, that implies it is shared between some
processes.  But namespace pointers themselves are shared between some of
these nsproxy's.  The lifetime mgmt here is one reason I haven't tried a
patch to do this.
Still, like Eric, I'm fine with trying that approach.  It just doesn't
seem like we can draw any meaningful conclusions with just one namespace
pointer, and adding a separate reference counted object around the
utsname pointer would seem to just make the code harder to review.

I suppose we could run some performance tests with some dummy namespace
pointers?  9 void *'s directly in the task struct, and the same inside a
refcounted container struct.  The results might add some urgency to
implementing the struct nsproxy.
