Hi James,
I've recently got a Sun Blade 1000 box with a QLA2200 controller, and 
I'm bumping into exact same problem with 2.6.22:
scsi 0:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg1 type -1
scsi 0:0:0:0: Direct-Access     HITACHI  DKR1C-J072FC     D7V5 PQ: 0 
ANSI: 3
kobject_add failed for 0:0:0:0 with -EEXIST, don't try to register 
things with the same name in the same directory.
Call Trace:

error 1
After that the device fails to initialize. On rare occasions the 
error does not trigger, and then machine boots fine. The complete boot
log can be found at 
http://www.wooyd.org/misc/dmesg-blade1000-2.6.22.log
 
I'm willing to test any patches you might have, as well as provide any 
additional debugging information.
Best regards,
