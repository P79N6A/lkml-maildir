hi
I am new to the kernel world and would be very glad if somebody could
help me with this problem.
I am unable to do printk or even a macro call like rdtsc()...(for
reading the time stamp counter) from within the "activate_task"
function on a kernel with smp support.But these work under the main
schedule() function.
I was able to do all these i.e., inside "activate_task" on a kernel
without smp support.Can anybody suggest a solution as to what could be
the problem??
somebody please help.
Thanks
Arun
