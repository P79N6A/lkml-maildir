Hello,
kernel: linux-2.5.44
hardware:DELL Inspiron 8100
config:
                CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV
                CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV
                CONFIG_SERIO

I just upgraded to 2.5.44 from 2.5.43.
In 2.5.43 I had a small PS/2 mouse problem, as it din't see my wart but only 
my scratch pad.
In 2.5.44 both my PS/2 mice are not available, neither is my keyboard, 
although after sufficient keystrokes, sometimes 5, sometimes more, the 
keyboard is found, this is with Xfree. 
Here is some relevant dmesg information.

The last time I booted in 2.5.44 the keyboard was found after about 20 
keystrokes but was useless as it produced weird escape sequences instead of 
normal characters, this was without XFree (to check if it had something to do 
with that).
