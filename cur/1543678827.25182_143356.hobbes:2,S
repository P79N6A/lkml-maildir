Just as the RedHat 8.0 kernels do, 2.4.22-pre1 enters the
  screen blanking due to inactivity but it doesn't unblank
  the screen anymore. 2.4.21 doesn't have this problem.
I can type commands and have them executed, but I don't
  see what I type (I do this from VCs after switching out
  of blind-X by Ctrl-Alt-F2 or first available tty anyway).
Dell Latitude C640, Radeon 7500 mobile, A07 bios, ACPI.
Any further info available to interested people :)
Thanks, ciao
