The whole naming scheme encoded into the tty code is incompatible with
udev. Udev allows renames and this code isn't aware of them.
I thought the idea behind udev was to remove all of this naming code
from the kernel and handle it in user space. So if I want legacy
device names I would add a section to /etc/udev to create them. Udev
is already capable of doing this.

So far I haven't identified anything that is really needed that isn't
already available in sysfs.
It does seem that we are missing a user space library call for
converting a device number into a device name using the udev database.
