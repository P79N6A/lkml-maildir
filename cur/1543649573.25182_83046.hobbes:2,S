I still refuse to believe that a 1.8GHz Pentium4 can only checksum
250megabits/second. MD Raid5 does better and they probably don't use a
checksum as braindead as that used by TCP.
If the checksumming is not the problem, the copying is, which would be a
weakness of your hardware. The function profiled does both the copying and
the checksumming.
But 250megabits/second also seems low.
Dave?
