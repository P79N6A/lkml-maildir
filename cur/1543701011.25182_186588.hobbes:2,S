    Hi Eugene :)

    Look for the chipset. I think all KT chipsets are supported.
    IMHO your worst problem will be the video card :(( If you can
live with binary-only drivers, you can use nVidia, things like that.
I don't know new video cards that provide open source drivers, or
which ones are natively supported by the stock kernels, sorry :(

    This should be supported. KT400 is supported (AFAIK), so KT600
may work.
> planning to get GeForce FX graphics card, if it makes a difference.
    Ask here before if you are planning to change your video card.
>So which board is more compatibile?
    I would make my bet for the Gigabyte one...

    Oh, ye olde kernel hacker... who hasn't write a line of code in
the kernel... Have you tried to be polite and stop making noise in
the list? Eugene is not an ignorant, since he has asked. You, on the
other hand, don't even have a name. Since you are very clever, you
won't mind if I write in spanish, gilipollas tonto del culo, es gente
como tú la que hace que las listas sean lugares insoportables, los
gaznápiros mendrugos que se creen algo porque se saben de memoria las
últimas notícias de los lugares para enterados. Bravo por tamaña
expresión de estulticia. Ahora a ver si encuentras quien te traduzca
esto, and sorry to the list for the flame bit, but I can't stand such
gilipollas.
