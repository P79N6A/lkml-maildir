    One of the FIC slot-1 motherboards of recent vintage has exactly
    that (the VB-601;  I can't say the vintage of the bios, because
    all the VB-601's I administer are parked about 4 miles north of
    me right now.)  That's what provoked the e820 implementation in
    the first place -- e801 would tell me I had half a gig, 88 would
    tell me 64mb, and e820 returns a memory map containing the correct
    128mb of system ram.
