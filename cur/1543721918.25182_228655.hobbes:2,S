And that point/difference would be ... what?  It IS real memory.
Not "main memory", so the device's DMA access never consumes
bandwidth on the "main" memory bus, but real nonetheless.
I'm having to guess at your point here, even from other emails.
You've asserted a difference, but not what it is.  Maybe it's
something to do with the problem's NUMA nature?  Are you for
some reason applying DMA _mapping_ requirements (main-memory
only) to the DMA memory _allocation_ problem?

Well, no other memory in the entire system meets the requirements
for the dma_alloc_coherent() API, since _only that_ chunk of memory
is works with that device's DMA hardware.  Which is the fundamental
problem that needs to be solved.  It can clearly done at the platform
level, using device- or bus-specific implementations.
