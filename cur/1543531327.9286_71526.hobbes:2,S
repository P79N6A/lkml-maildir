As you may have guessed, -1 here means 'no value supplied'. Setting
the uid/gid here is a bug on many NFS servers (they refuse to create
the file), hence we leave it to the server to choose.
The fsuid/fsgid will be passed to the server via the RPC credential
scheme, and most (but not all) servers choose to use this for the file
creation.

Note: In my NFSv3 client patches, it's possible to define
NFSD_BROKEN_UID in fs/nfs/dir.c, to cause the attributes to be set
explicitly in the CREATE call. Because of the afore-mentioned problems
with some servers it is not enabled by default.
