VSA2 is mainly used to support the GX and LX processors, and the 
CS5535 and CS5536 southbridges.  The southbridges both have 
native AC97 controllers, supported by the snd-cs5535 driver
in the kernel and maintained by Jaya Kumar.
These just work, straight out of the box.
And as an aside, the VSA2 source code is open, so you can peruse
it and discover its secrets for yourself:
