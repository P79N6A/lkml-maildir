The bass/treble controls are working poorly (introducing a lot of
distortion and clipping), that's why I decided not to enable them by default.
I'm working on a tool to let anyone select which "goodies" they want loaded
into the driver, so the situation should improve soon. This means
loading/unloading/stacking any type of dsp microcode programs for special
sound effects (like the bass and treble).
