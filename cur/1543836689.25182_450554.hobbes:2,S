But head.S does do a call (on i386 but not x86_64 AFAICT):
| #ifdef CONFIG_SMP
|        movb ready, %cl
|        movb $1, ready
|        cmpb $0,%cl
|        je 1f                   # the first CPU calls start_kernel
|                                # all other CPUs call initialize_secondary
|        call initialize_secondary
|        jmp L6
| 1:
| #endif /* CONFIG_SMP */
|        call start_kernel
| L6:
|        jmp L6                  # main should never return here, but
|                                # just in case, we know what happens.
And the backtraces I saw ended up at L6:
| DWARF2 unwinder stuck at 0xc0100210
System.map on i386 SMP says:
| c0100210 t L6
