Regarding the new 'ip' command:
I would really like to suggest that instead of deprecating route,
ifconfig, etc. in favor of ip, we either extend route and ifconfig to
understand the kernel routing abilities or write a syntax compatibility
mode for ip so, when called via a symlink to route, it understands route's
old syntax. 
Anyone running a heterogenous Unix shop with lots of boxes to admin will
thank you.

P.S. And cast one more vote for having an option to shut off autorouting
(assuming we're actually voting :)  I hate having to learn new behaviours
for no apparent benefit.
