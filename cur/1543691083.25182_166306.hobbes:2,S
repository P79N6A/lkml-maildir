I saw something very similar in 2.4.23-pre2, couldn't swear it was exactly the 
same, but definitely very similar. The very odd thing was that it only 
occured the first time I booted the kernel (at which pointed I rebooted to 
the old one and rebuilt it, but then forgot to copy the new image into /boot 
and rebooted). The next time it booted fine and since then (20+ boots?) it 
seems to have worked fine every time. I've got ide-scsi on hdc as well and 
had applied the cpufreq patch too, wonder if thats important. Not had a 
chance to try 2.4.23-pre4 yet, I've been away. I'm using gcc version 3.3 
20030226 (prerelease) (SuSE Linux).

Edward
