Huh. You're right. It seems that tail has changed since I last looked at the
source. Now it uses stat() instead. However, tail in textutils 2.0.11 still
calls sleep(). I don't know how sleep() is implemented, but it's not
impossible for it to use nanosleep() and signals. I believe I read something
about SIGALRM...
