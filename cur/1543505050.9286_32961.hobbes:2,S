There's a very preliminary driver module available in
	
ftp://ftp.linux-mtd.infradead.org/pub/mtd/DiskOnChip/
I've just got it working, and I have a lot of tidying up to do - including 
fixing the module use counts. But it's enough to use the DiskOnChip 2000 in 
read-only mode for now.
More next week.
