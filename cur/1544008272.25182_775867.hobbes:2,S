Sorry, you are reading it wrong, the i values inside the loop are 
identical to those in the original. The value of i starts at count, and 
the test comes *before* the value is used inside the loop. The values of 
i inside the loop start at count-1 and go to zero, just as it did in the 
original. That's why the "i--" is there, the test is on the 
unincremented value range count to one, but the value inside the loop is 
correct (or at least is the same as the original patch).

As I said, the values used are identical, and the code works correctly.
