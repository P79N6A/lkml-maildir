Well, I think the merge should go the other way in this case: this
really does simplify things.
The only thing stopping x86-64 from doing the same as i386 is the
stack-protector stuff.  And that can be fixed (unfortunately requires a
gcc patch to change the %gs:40 to %gs:__gcc_stack_protector_offset and
emit a weak absolute symbol __gss_stack_protector_offset = 40).
I shall prepare a patch for that next week; I've been busy Kleening up
lguest 8)
