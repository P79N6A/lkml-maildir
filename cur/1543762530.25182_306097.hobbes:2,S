Someday maybe we should make serial rely on PNP, and only
use the compiled-in table when PNP isn't available or is
turned off.  Then ports would just be numbered sequentially
as they're discovered.  And it would also help with the
current situation where ttyS0/1 are often discovered two
or three times.

My patch was against the -mm tree, and I think one of the
differences between 2.5.11 and the -mm tree was the
removal of 9835 from parport_pc.  Sounds like you've
figured that out already :-)
