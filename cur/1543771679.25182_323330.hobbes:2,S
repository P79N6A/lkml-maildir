Hi
I am trying to implement a different process scheduling algorithm in linux
kernel 2.4.30. I am doing this as a hobby and am using User Mode Linux
to test my changes. I have the following problems with the implement
1) Whenever I select a process to run using my algorithm the kernel
panics with "Segfault with no mm" basically the "mm" field of the
task_struct that I selected is empty. I don't understand why this
should happen, since I have just added code to select a process and
haven't modified any memory related code in the schedule() function.
2) I am able to run the UMLfied kernel under gdb, however the execution
never halts even though I set several breakpoints. Also these
breakpoints have not been set in interrupt handling code and I have
compiled the code with -g option.
I have been stuck with these problems since a long time and would
appreciate if someone could help me with it.
Thank you all.
