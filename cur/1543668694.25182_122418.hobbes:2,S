you're right, it should be. When I was writing the original mail I had it
running in degraded mode so I edited the values that /proc/mdstat gave me to
match the array in normal mode. I forgot to make [_UUUU]  [UUUUU]. I'm
currently rebuilding the array but it's taking some time...
md0 : active raid5 hdc1[5] hdk1[4] hdi1[3] hdg1[2] hde1[1]
      468872704 blocks level 5, 128k chunk, algorithm 0 [5/4] [_UUUU]
