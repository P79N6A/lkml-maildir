I have been reading CKRM docs this week and I think something which provides the 
same functionality is required for v2.7.
I haven't read the code yet, though. It probably should be converted to 
"linux style" and simplified whenever possible.
Right now our resource-limit infrastructure is very basic and limited. CKRM 
provides advanced/fine grained resource management.
