Tons of these and on the second (re-) compile I switched off
verbose route monitoring, did not help at all, the thingy was
spilling out so many messages I could not even press ctrl-l
"often enough" to get the hint of a screen.
Any idea appreciated...
And as for the pnp stuff (sb, ess1686 here) it was not
honoring my (or isapnpconf's) irq 9 for it and was taking
the irq 5 from the isdn card but I fixed this by ordering
the sb module at the very end of /etc/modules. And just
now I am kicking isapnpconf, the kernel module works
nicely...
