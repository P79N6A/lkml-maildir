I believe, barriers not needed, not now.
This scheme relies on the fact that remove_proc_entry() will be the only
place that will clear ->proc_fops and, once cleared, ->proc_fops will
never be resurrected. Clearing of ->proc_fops will eventually propagate
to CPU doing first check, thus preveting refcount bumps from this CPU.
What can be missed is some "rogue" readers or writers¹. Big deal.

¹ Sigh, modules should do removals of proc entries first. And I should check
  for that.
