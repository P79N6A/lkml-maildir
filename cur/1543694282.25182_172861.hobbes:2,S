No, it would also need to check pci_domain_nr(dev->bus) .. and it doesn't
have anything to check it against as that information isn't passed into
the function.

The only real way to do it is to inline pci_get_slot() into tg3.  Since I
also have a need for it in sym2, that doesn't seem like a sensible idea.
It would also be racy since it wouldn't take the pci_bus_lock.

The pci_bus knows which domain it's in.  We don't have to check it since
we only walk its children.
