Huh?
The API for raw devices is the one which makes sense.  The guts of the 
implementation are concerned with IO and VM issues.  The implementating
of the block device binding is a trivial side-issue which is dictated
by the existing design of the kernel: you are taking issue with maybe
20 lines of code and dismissing the solution for not fixing the entire
kernel while it was at it??
Get real, please.
