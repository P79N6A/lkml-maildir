It was already voodoo with pcap in the causal loop. So more
voodoo doesn't have the thrill it might have otherwise.
Passing acpi=off did the trick. Throughput is at the higher rate
with or without pcap monitoring. I did not have to change any BIOS
settings.
More info previously promised:
- Removing one of the RealTek adapters did not help.
- The problem still exists in 2.6.10-rc2 and 2.6.10-rc2-bk13.
