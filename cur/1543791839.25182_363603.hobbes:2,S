Any particular reason it's taking so long? Would it perhaps be possible
to do a subset (e.g. only a single architecture and less configs) sooner?
If the problem is writing the necessary scripts, I'm sure some people
(e.g. M. Bligh or Al Viro) have already written some that do
at least the automated building and would be happy to
share them.
