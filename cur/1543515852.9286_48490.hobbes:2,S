	Not ones that leave the wait queues alone until they've confirmed that
you're going to block!
	Under low load, you will typically block. Under high load, you will rarely
block. A good implementation becomes more efficient under load.

	Well that's not good. Wouldn't it be smarter to only touch wait queues once
you've confirmed that you need to block? That way, in the no-block case
(which is the only one that matters under load), your implementation will be
extremely fast.

	The problem is, one single call to poll can tell you that 10,000 sockets
are ready for I/O. It's much more expensive to deliver 10,000 signals. Of
course, this assumes a poll implementation that doesn't assume you are going
to block.
	Sounds to me like a Linux problem being blamed on an API.
