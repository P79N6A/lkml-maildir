Troubles are infrequent also here, usually i get the errors at boot, now with the
aic7xxx driver in 2.4.8-ac7 with aic7xxx=verbose i still haven't got them but i
also get the errors sometimes after a hour of 8 / 9 of uptime, as the box is 
around this uptime at the moment, i'll probably be expecting some errors very soon
