Okay, I'll look into the overhead imposed by this lock.  Assuming the lock
is not held (which is the only case that matters, because otherwise,
access would block on the console_lock currently), we have the following
(for the x86 at least, the others are similar):
spin_lock:
        "xchgb %b0,%1"
	"cmp $1, ..."
	"jz ..."
Note that the jump is not taken, so it is one cycle.
spin_unlock:
	"movb $1,%0"
Now by my count, the xchg takes a cycle to decode, and a cycle to execute
(the implicit lock).  The cmp & jmp takes a cycle, the movb takes a
cycle.  That's five cycles (+/- 3 due to instr scheduling and
stuff) added to a very UNCOMMON path.
Uncommon?  Yes, according to dmesg, my fairly "thick" 2.4.0test1 kernel
has printed out:
$ dmesg | wc -l
     93
93 printk's.  This includes several:
keyboard: Too many NACKs -- noisy kbd cable?
Due to my keyboard switch.  
Multiply that by a factor of ten to take into account any configuation
reasonable, and I _STILL_ don't see an overhead impact on a stock kernel.
Now if you are talking about debug situations... where printk is actually
used, I bet people would rather have a forgiving printk than a blazing
fast kill-me-if-I-take-a-shortcut printk.
I may be missing something, but I really don't see the overhead involved
here.  printk is a debugging tool and should be treated as such.
