No. You can consider this as harmless buglet in traceroute.
It uses raw socket and forgets that he should respect normal
rules when building IP header.
Actually, I seriously advise not to set setuid root on traceroute.
Malicious and skillful user can make really terrible things with it.
He is unlikely to find a way to crash system, but he will be able
to generate all the kinds of confusing messages at least.
Use "tracepath" instead. It is not so rich, but it does not
require priviledges.
