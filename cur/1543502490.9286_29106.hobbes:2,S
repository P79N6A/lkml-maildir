long tests during the weekend showed that it's bad memory in my case (or other 
hardware problem, I'll replace memory tomorrow and we'll know for sure:-(.
thanks to Daniel Kobras <daniel.kobras@student.uni-tuebingen.de> I got a 
nice small hack for testing ram which has only _very_ rare bit errors like in 
my case.  it allocates and reserves (almost) all memory, fills it with
all 1s (in my case) and then only sits there and tests the memory for changes
from time to time.
in my case, in bytes with address regexp pattern 0x07[01].[159d]c68 and 0x07[89].[159d]468
(just below 128M) sometimes bit 5 got cleared (0xff -> 0xbf) after many minutes
(usually many 10 minutes to hours).
this also matches the pattern which I found once when the emacs binary
was corrupted in buffer cache (do the decimal/octal/hex math yourself 
and keep in mind that `cmp' starts counting at 1!) :
	# cmp -l /usr/bin/emacs.good /usr/bin/emacs.bad
	300137 355 255
and dropping bits in the ext2fs allocation bitmap pages can explain the `duplicate block's
which I got as only fs curruption pattern.

PS: memtest86 really should be improved to do such a test "wait _long_ time for bit flips"
since it's now the 3rd time where I see/know such problems.
