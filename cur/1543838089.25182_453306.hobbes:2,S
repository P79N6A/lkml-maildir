MUTUAL TRUST
Dear Sir/Madam
RE: YOUR ASSISTANCE IS HIGHLY NEEDED
I am very sure that this mail will bring lots of surprises and curiosity 
to you since there was no previous correspondence before now 
between us.
I am a widow of one of the top rulers in Chechnya, My husband died 
along side with the Chenchan president who was killed in a bomb 
attack early this year in a parade ground.
My husband told me before his death that he has a credit of $45M USD 
which he deposited overseas and handed to me all the documents 
which my lawyer has confirmed with the authority concerned.
Right now I am looking for an Investor who will help me to invest the 
total sum in the west and after which I will relocate to your country.
The security situation in Chechnya does not warrant me to do much 
from
here,therefore I have designated my family lawyers who will co 
ordinate
every aspect of the fund transfer and the investment with your
assistance.
I am ready to concede up to 25% of the funds to you as your share if
you will help me to pull the funds and invest it in your country which 
has a stable economy.
Upon receipt of your acceptance letter to my private mail box quoted
below,I will introduce you to my family lawyer for details on
how the transfer can be done in the shortest possible time.
NOTE: The main assistant is after the money has been transfered into
your personal/company account,you are going to assist us in investing 
the money in your country and supervise the total investment over 
there.
For security reasons all other information will reach you through my
direct email:mrssuzzan_555@yahoo.com
Awaiting your Urgent response via my direct email
address.
Regards,
Mrs.Suzzan Sainovic
