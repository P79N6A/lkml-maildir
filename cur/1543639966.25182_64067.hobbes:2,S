A start would be Bob Matthews's IRMAN program:

I've also been talking with Randy Hwron(sp?) about doing
latency tests with all his benchmarks.
If I wasn't so distracted by various other TODO items I'd
already have a dbench with latency histograms in it ;)
(yes, I know dbench is a bad benchmark, but it also seems
to be the most abused one.  Making the thing show exactly
how much unfairness and bad latency there is will probably
make some people look at dbench results with very different
eyes)
cheers,
Rik
