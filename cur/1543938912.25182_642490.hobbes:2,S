Hi Linus, Peter, Ingo,
we're seeing a VERY repeatable oops on module unload on the Intel
wireless drivers with lockdep enabled; turns out Michael Wu had already
rootcaused this type of crash (see URL below), however the fix he has
would increase the structure size of the lockdep metadata a lot; a much
simpler fix for the  oops is in the patch below; the lockdep module
unload code just was not agressive enough in  detecting which metadata
structures to nuke. With this patch a very repeatable oops on unload
went away (Reinette tested it and it survived > 100 unload cycles now).
The oops happens even in 2.6.24-rc8 and the fix is rather obvious, so
it might even be 2.6.24 material (or for 24-stable just after that)

Michael Wu noticed in his lkml post at
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119396182726091&w=2
that certain wireless drivers ended up having their name 
in module memory, which would then crash the kernel on module
unload.
The patch he proposed was a bit clumsy in that it increased the
size of a lockdep entry significantly; the patch below tries another
approach, it checks, on module teardown, if the name of a class is
in module space and then zaps the class. This is very similar to what
we already do with keys that are in module space.
