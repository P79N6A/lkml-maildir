On the other hand, things like dbus are low-level and slowly getting
used by everyone... we also have the libc :)

I don't fully agree. The kernel will do the actual HW banging, but
we want things like EDID overrides per monitor models, persistent
configuration saved to storage etc... all of that beeing pretty
nasty to do in the kernel.

I have mixed feeling on that. Keith Packard seem to prefer the library
approach. I don't know for sure what Linus prefers here. Currently, I
feel we are trying to do too much in the kernel, and that will become
increasingly painful to manage as we get multiple head & geometry stuff
getting in the picture.
