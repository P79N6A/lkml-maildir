While looking through the latest bk changelogs, I noticed that you had
submitted this patch using msleep(). When I read the comment, though,
that you were offsetting the 1 millisecond with a jiffy, I was slightly
confused as msleep() is designed to sleep for *at least* the time
requested. So if you just use msleep(1) in these cases, you should have
the desired effect. msleep() is designed to be independent of HZ (as the
timeout is specified in non-jiffy units). Not using the
jiffies_to_msecs() macro would remove some extra instructions... The
attached patch makes this change (on top of your patch currently in bk7)
and also changes the other schedule_timeout()s (at least, those that can
be) to msleep.
-Nish
Description: Uses msleep() instead of schedule_timeout() to guarantee
the task delays as expected. Two of the changes are reworks of previous
msleep() calls which unnecessarily added a jiffy to the parameter.
