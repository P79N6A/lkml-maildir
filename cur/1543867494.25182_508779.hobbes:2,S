i'm not sure what you mean here either - aio_read()/write()/etc. could 
very much be implemented using syslets - and in fact one goal of syslets 
is to enable such use. struct aiocb is mostly shaped by glibc internals, 
and it currently has 32 bytes of free space. Enough to put a single atom 
there. (or a pointer to an atom)
