Hallo,
as David Parker ( and another person) found out, UMSDOS filesystems
show broken behaviour under Wine ( at least up to 2.2.16). File and
Directory creation is inconsistant when filenames outside the FAT 8.3
namedomain is  involved. 
This is caused be UMSDOS misbehaving:
UMSDOS does not store the long filename in the area reserved for long
filenames in VFAT. As long as one doesn't want to mount the filesystem 
at a later time with VFAT, this wouldn't disturb to much. However
UMSDOS forwards all unknown IOCTLs to the MSDOS base driver. This is
where the problem happens. Wine uses the VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH ioctl
to retrieve both the short and long filename and gets an invaild long
filename.
Short range fix:
- Add the VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH ioctl to the list of ioctls not
passed to MSDOS fs driver.
That way Wine get's a failure on the try to use the
VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH ioctl and handles things like on ext2.
A fix is appended.
Right fix:
- Do not only store the long filename in the --linux-.--- file but
also in the VFAT longfilename area.
Is anyone mantaining the UMSDOS filesystem?
Bye
