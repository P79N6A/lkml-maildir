You agree it's a hardware bug. Which implies it should be fixed. In
hardware. Not worked around in software. Sometimes, as with the
pentium bug, you do want to hack things, since doing so works
around the problem and Intel wasn't forth coming with a hardware
fix at first. No functionality was lost with the work around. Not so here.
Functionality will be lost.
