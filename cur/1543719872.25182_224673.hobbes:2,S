Subject: [PATCH] fix sys cpumap for > 352 NR_CPUS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/2/261

Due to a bug in the 2.6 kernel, the cpumap files, such as:
  /sys/devices/system/node/node1/cpumap
only display the high order 352 CPUs.  If you compile a kernel with
NR_CPUS=512, such as SGI's Altix is usually compiled, then the low order
512-352 == 160 CPU positions are not shown.
This bug breaks Andi Kleens numactl and libnuma user code which depends
on this file presenting correctly.  Andi has reviewed this fix, and it
builds, boots and fixes the breakage (ia64 with sn2_defconfig).
Please apply the following patch (a hack, but better than the hack that
was there before).
