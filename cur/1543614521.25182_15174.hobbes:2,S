Subject: Sound issues with kernel 2.4.14 - 2.4.17

Sound worked fine through kernel 2.4.9. Since I upgraded to 2.4.14, and
now to 2.4.17 (I skipped 2.4.10 - 2.4.13) I have several games that are
FUBAR, all sound related: Quake III Arena and Quake II both core dump
initializing sound; Soldier of Fortune, Railroad Tycoon II, Sid Myers
Alpha Centaury all make strange noises with no intelligable game sound.
Tribes 2, Unreal Tournament, and Descent 3 all work fine. GNOME and
Enlightenment sound work fine as well, as does xmms.
I have a SB Live! OEM and have tried compiling with and without the MIDI
module. The main thing is I am trying to do some game development and
it's impossible when sound is FUBAR. Any ideas?
I hate to go back to an earlier kernel as IDE did not work (for me) in
the previous kernels.
