I'm afraid this isn't the whole story, as there's still the matter of
speculative reads. That is, reads can be speculatively moved back in time
so that they occur before the write on the other processor.
The notion of concurrence is rather fuzzy here anyway - the communication
latency between processors means that each processor sees every other
processor as it was in the immediate past, but never the present.
To answer Linda's original question, whether it's necessary to use a lock
is very much dependent on the operation you're performing. It's safe to
assume there's an arbitrarily long delay before your write appears to
another processor, but we're also currently assuming that all writes show
up in the order they were performed.
