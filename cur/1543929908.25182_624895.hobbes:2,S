But we still want to be compliant to what POSIX defines. The problem isn't the
consistency of the readdir result but the seekdir/telldir interface. IMHO that
interface is totally broken: you need to be able to find every offset given by
telldir since the last open. The problem is that seekdir isn't able to return
errors. Otherwise you could just forbid seeking on union directories.

Yes, that is a nice idea and it is exactly what I have implemented in my patch
series. But you forgot one thing: directories are not flat files. The dentry
offset in a directory is a random cookie. Therefore it is not possible to have
a linear mapping without allocating memory.

Yes, I'm using such a patch on our S390 buildservers to work around some
readdir/seek/rm problem with old glibc versions. It seems to work but on the
other hand this are really huge systems and I haven't run out of memory while
doing a readdir yet ;)
The proper way to implement this would be to cache the offsets on a per inode
base. Otherwise the user could easily DoS this by opening a number of
directories and never close them.
