This is how I implemented via_dsp_open as well.
Is this why USB's audio device handling of SNDCTL_DSP_SETDUPLEX is null?
        case SNDCTL_DSP_SETDUPLEX:
                return 0;

Or you have cheap hardware with a fixed sample rate which is the same
for both channels.  :)  AC97 1.0-compliancy requires at least that.
