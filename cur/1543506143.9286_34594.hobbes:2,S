I fixed floppy.c last week in case you're wondering about that ;-)
It's in Alan's prepatch for 2.2.12, don't know whether Linus accepted
it for 2.3.x yet.
FYI this meant that after about 20 days, the floppy was unusable on
alpha (timeout errors due to assumptions about jiffies fitting into
ints). As the alpha has a 1024Hz clock, this problem is apparent much
sooner there.
