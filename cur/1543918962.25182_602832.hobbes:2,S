serial driver write methods are called from the ldisc not the tty so the
code is in fact totally bogus.
I suspect what is needed (other than to take the entire driver to bits
and put it back together using serial_core) is 
	if (down_trylock(&port->tty_sem))
		return 0;
and the driver is then required to wake the write wait queue when that
condition becomes false - or at least before/when it runs out of
data (which currently it doesn't seem to for all cases).
Lots of other breakage in it as well (termios function is totally bogus,
tty_flip_queue_function is a no-op) etc etc
