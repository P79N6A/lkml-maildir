DMA_ALIGN, DMA_ALIGN_BYTES or DMA_CACHE_BYTES.
Hmm, thinking about this some more (and just rambling).  On some ARMs
(maybe other CPUs as well) each cache line has two dirty bits - one
for each half.  If only half the cache line is dirty, it will only
write out the dirty half when evicting it.  In this case, we'd want:
#define L1_CACHE_BYTES	32
#define DMA_CACHE_BYTES	16
which will probably work as long as we handle stuff carefully in the
architecture specific layer.
