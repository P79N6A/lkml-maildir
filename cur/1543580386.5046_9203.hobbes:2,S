since I'm certainly not the other one, I'm not going to confirm it ;-)
But, besides it sounds reasonable, I could give some more ammu:
my IDE controller is located in the SiS5591 hostbridge (device 00:00)
and the BIOS didn't provide a routing table entry for this device.
Hence, instead of the confusing conflict messages, I get:
SIS5513: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 01
IRQ for 00:00.1:0 -> not found in routing table
which you may take for a vice-versa prove of your explanation.
