I need "ptr" in my_task_that_may_sleep(), but regarding my case,
memory region pointed by "ptr" will never be kfree()ed.
So, I don't need to grab a reference to "ptr"
because memory region pointed by "ptr" will never be kfree()ed.
And it is legal to use "ptr" after rcu_read_unlock()
because memory region pointed by "ptr" will never be kfree()ed.
Thank you.
