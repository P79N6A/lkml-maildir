The nanosleep02 failure is incorrect due to rounding errors in the test
code.
Requested time to sleep is 5.000009999 seconds (5s 9999ns)
Program flow is:
unsigned long req, rem, before, after, elapsed;
gettimeofday(&otime);
nanosleep(&timereq, &timerem); <- Interrupted by a signal
gettimeofday(&ntime);
req = timereq.tv_sec * 1000 + timereq.tv_nsec / 1000000;
rem = timerem.tv_sec * 1000 + timerem.tv_nsec / 1000000;
before = otime.tv_sec * 1000 + otime.tv_usec/1000;
after = ntime.tv_sec * 1000 + ntime.tv_usec/1000;
elapsed = after - before;
if (rem - (req -elapsed) > 250)
	fail;
The error message is:
nanosleep02    1  FAIL  :  Remaining sleep time 3999 msec doesn't match with the expected 4000 msec time
rem: 3999 ms
req - elasped: 4000 ms
The unsigned long subtraction results in a value > 250, where the real
result is < 0.
Looking at the real values with usec resolution gives:
req: 5000009 usec 
rem: 3999740 usec
elapsed: 1000452 usec
req - elapsed: 3999557 usec
rem - (req -elapsed) = 183 usec
Truncating the real values by the division used in the test code results
in:
req_ms = 5000010 / 1000 = 5000 ms
rem_ms = 3999470 / 1000 = 3999 ms
elapsed_ms = 1000452 / 1000 = 1000ms
req_ms - elapsed_ms = 4000ms
This never happens on vanilla, as the nanosleep is rounded to the next
jiffie. -rt has high resolution timers which are delivered accurate, so
the rounding errors of the testcode surface.
