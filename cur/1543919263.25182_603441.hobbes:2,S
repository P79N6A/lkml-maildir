Excellent idea!  I think it applies to || as well.  I'll most likely
add a -Wboolean-logic-on-bit-constant to turn this warning on.
Any reason why this wouldn't apply to octal constants or to GCC's new
binary constants?  I can trivially modify this patch to handle those
as well, just by dropping the check for an 'x' or 'X', and renaming the
flag.
As far as patch beauty goes, I think this patch looks just fine.
