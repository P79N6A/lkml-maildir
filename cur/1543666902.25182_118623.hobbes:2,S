Again: I don't like API at all.
Anycast address management itself in that patch would be ok.
However, JOIN/LEAVE is NOT useful and userland application will be 
incompatible with other implementation. (sigh...)
I think linux likes unicast model (assign address like unicast address), too.
And, we see __constant_{hton,ntoh}{l,h}() again...
