I'd prefer this not to use hibernation hooks... existing dumping
infrastructure should be good enough to write resume image, no?
BTW... is this able to do kdump, then return back to the old kernel?
That seems to be similar functionality to hibernation, and I was told
it would be very welcome.

This seems like mostly generic stuff for going between two kernels,
no? I'd prefer it not be hooked into hibernation infrastructure.
