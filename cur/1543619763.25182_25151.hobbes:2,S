I don't think predictable elements in the audio hurt anything.
So long as there is a noise component, things are fine.
Take the case of a half-full-scale 60 Hz sine wave plus a tiny
bit of noise.  No problem---each sample would still be worth
0.1 bit because the attacker can only guess the 60 Hz part:
subtract this out and you've still got unpredictable noise.
Same deal with crosstalk between channels, so long as it's
reasonably small, say -20 dB or better (as it will be with any
sane sound chip).

Aha, nothing new under the sun.
