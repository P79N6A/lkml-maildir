Please CC me, thank you.
I can write just fine to the tape, but reading gives me the following
error:
# tar -tvf  /dev/ht0
ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc = 8, key = 5, asc = 2c, ascq = 0
A search on deja.com shows that I am not the only one to have
experienced this and that it did not occur with previous versions of
ide-tape.c. The same error occurs with a non-modular kernel build.
The machine is a i386 redhat 7.0, kernel compiled with egcs 1.1.2.
