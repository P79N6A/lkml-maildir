I haven't checked, but I suspect that would break the glibc user space
implementations.
Overall the concept of kernel reserved numbers doesn't make too much
sense as a API because there is always a legitimate need to emulate it in
userspace when you have appropiate credentials. It is just a convenient
hack to bypass the credentials checking in signal sending for some cases.

My patch of course changed this line to if (!SI_FROMUSER(&info)), 
you probably missed that hunk..
There are two approaches: break the programs that expect to parse
si_code in signals/sigwaitinfo or break the program that use
sigqueueinfo() with arbitary values.
I would have expected that the second one is less painless, but it turned
out someone already took the first approach for SIGIO in 2.4 by turning 
si_code into a bastardized si_band (which I don't quite follow, because
si_band already exists)
