You should see some complaints in kernel log, or, maybe, on server's 
console. In kernel log you should see some 'NCP server not responding' or
'ncp_rpc_call: recv error = NN'. Or maybe you are getting 'An NCP request
with an invalid security signature was received from user <you> at
<your address>. Possible intruder or network corruption.'
You also must not send SIGKILL to processes which are in the middle of
NCP transaction. Because of ncpfs does not use its own thread (or bh)
to implement NCP ping-pong protocol, connection becomes invalid after
such action, as ping-pong was not successfully completed.
Are you sure that you do not have directory restriction
on your directory, and that you are not running some ipxripd which
could remove route to server from your routing tables?

P.S.: It is possible to create 2GB file full of data on ncpfs with 2.4.17, 
or 4GB file with few patches here...
