Ken,
Attached is an update to my previous vmscan.patch.2.4.17.c
Version "d" fixes a BUG due to a race in the old code _and_
is much less agressive at cache_shrinkage or conversely more
willing to swap out but not as much as the stock kernel.
It continues to work well wrt to high vm pressure.
Give it a whirl to see if it changes your "-j" symptoms.
If you like you can change the one line in the patch
from "DEF_PRIORITY" which is "6" to progressively smaller
values to "tune" whatever kind of swap_out behaviour you
like.
