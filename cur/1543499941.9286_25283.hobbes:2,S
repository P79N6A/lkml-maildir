I relased a 2.3.7_andrea1.bz2 with my pagemap-lru shrink_mmap now even
SMP-threaded in respect to the big kernel lock and of the page cache lock.
I also fixed a cupole of bugs and races in 2.3.7 and now I can't corrupt
the page cache anymore with 2.3.7_andrea1 (in SMP too).
So I ask if database people or everybody else who can do some benchmarks
to produce some number with:
	2.2.10
	2.3.7 (trying to not doing append to file not cached otherwise
	       you'll get corruption)
	2.3.7_andrea1
I think there will be quite a bit of difference in performances between
2.3.7 and 2.3.7_andrea1. The VM balance of 2.3.7_andrea1 during heavy swap
is really amazing according to my eyes :).
