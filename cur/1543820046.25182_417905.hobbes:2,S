Hmm, let's see:
[asuardi@donkey src]$ grep tcpudp linux-2.6.17-rc1-git4/net/netfilter/Makefile
obj-$(CONFIG_NETFILTER_XTABLES) += x_tables.o xt_tcpudp.o
OK, I recall configuring this a while ago when still using FC3,
 as I was bitten too by iptables complaining with the bogus
 error code which I eventually tracked back to the XTABLES
 stuff (no - make oldconfig didn't do it for me and I had to go
 through the config options by hand enabling what I thought
 was useful). That was since...
[asuardi@donkey src]$ grep -i XTABLES /fc3/usr/src/.config-2.6.1[0-7]*
/fc3/usr/src/.config-2.6.15-git10:CONFIG_NETFILTER_XTABLES=m
/fc3/usr/src/.config-2.6.15-git11:CONFIG_NETFILTER_XTABLES=m
/fc3/usr/src/.config-2.6.16-rc1-git4:CONFIG_NETFILTER_XTABLES=m
/fc3/usr/src/.config-2.6.16-rc2-git7:CONFIG_NETFILTER_XTABLES=m
And without any special tricks, my bittorrent box (which also
 has peerguardian running) loads xt_tcpudp automatically,
 as it should be...
