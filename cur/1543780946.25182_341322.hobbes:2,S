Its entirely possible that the last time I saw it work was in fact on
a bt878 card, one I junked because the tuner was apparently damaged,
needing something like 10,000 u-v to give a useable picture.  I
assumed (theres that word again) that the CC decoding was seperately
handled by inspecting the output video data stream regardless of its
source.  Mentally to me, that then would have been a tvtime function
and not a cx88 function.  It makes far more sense to me anyway.
Sorry for the false alarm.
