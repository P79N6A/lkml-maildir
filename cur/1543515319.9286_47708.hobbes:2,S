Meaning that all binary distributions of the kernel should come with
include files?  And that /usr/include/linux should really be a symlink
to /var/run/linux, and that the /var/run links should be managed at
boot time?
This is doable, but since it breaks some other things (and kernel make
install doesn't support this) it would be a good thing to have more than
one reputable person suggesting it.

XFree86 seems to manage.
[Yeah, I know, xfree86 isn't bttv...  but I think what you're talking
about here is a layering problem as much as anything.  Or is that too
obvious of a comment?]
