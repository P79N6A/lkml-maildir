I have an external USB drive (WD MyBook 5000YS), which I use for backups.
When I try to back up to it, it works for a while, but inevitably
starts resetting like mad, gives I/O errors, and then (here's the
problem), the softdog module reboots the system.

SoftDog: Initiating system reboot.
-----------------------------------------------------
Now, the USB problem may well be a device or cabling issue, but I
don't think that this drive failure should trigger a reboot - I assume
the drive failure is somehow constipating the entire disk I/O system,
and preventing my softdog-patting script from running.
My softdog script loops 'date >/tmp/$logfile;echo 1 > /dev/watchdog; sleep
30'. Nothing in it accesses the USB disk. /tmp is tmpfs.
Should the USB failure cause this problem?
