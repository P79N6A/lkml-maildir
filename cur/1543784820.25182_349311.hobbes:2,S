Hi Linus.
First round of small kbuild fixes (it's monday here in 15 minutes).
o Rename prepare to archprepare to get dependency order correct
o fix silentoldconfig with make O=
o rename mips/kernel/offset.c to asm-offsets.c
Can be pulled from:
	www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sam/kbuild.git
I've started suing the alternate format as you described.
So I cannot pull from that respository myself.
http: + rsync: failed?
I hope you know a few smart tricks.
diffstat - the major part is the rename.
The rest is only a few lines / one-liners.
