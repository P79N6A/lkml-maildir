   Which private entry points did they use?

   I statically link every elf program I have to use these days,
   because it's the only way to guarantee that it will work.
   It adds ~250k to each and every binary, which isn't perfect,
   but in the land of 128mb memory sticks costing US$180 is a
   lot faster than writing a completely new libc and trying to
   get other people to use it.
   How many _programs_ are in the SO suite?

   david parsons \bi/    Of course a.out doesn't have this problem, because
                  \/  (other) people aren't poking at the libraries anymore.
		             Bummer I can't get XF3.3.3 to compile as a.out.
