It's a very nice idea Nick.
You also have for free the number or cpus that are before you.
On big SMP/NUMA, we could use this information to call a special lock_cpu_relax() function to avoid cacheline transferts.
	asm volatile(LOCK_PREFIX "xaddw %0, %1\n\t"
		     : "+r" (pos), "+m" (lock->qhead) : : "memory");
	for (;;) {
		unsigned short nwait = pos - lock->qtail;
		if (likely(nwait == 0))
			break;
		lock_cpu_relax(lock, nwait);
	}
lock_cpu_relax(raw_spinlock_t *lock, unsigned int nwait)
{
unsigned int cycles = nwait * lock->min_cycles_per_round;
busy_loop(cycles);
}
