Will this be included/fixed in 2.6.8?
How serious is the problem?  The system doesn't seem to panic or 
indicate backup
failures.
Setting up a CVS tree to get a patch for a "stable-series" kernel seems 
a bit
unstable.  I'm not sure what I'd pull in besides the fix or even if I'd pull
down a coherent/stable CVS image if I downloaded in the middle of when some
other patch was being checked in.  Maybe I'm sounding like a wimp, but 
the idea
of pulling in freshly checked in CVS code for use on a 'stable' machine is
bordering on my discomfort zone. :-)
