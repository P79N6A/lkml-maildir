That's what it says, but I don't think it was the intention, given
that the company itself published the source under the GPL  and put them 
up on Sourceforge. What I need is the correct legalese to replace the
above which makes it legal to redistribute (easy) and to combine with
the GPL'd bulk of linux - that's the difficult bit. Once I have
said legalese I'll put it to Atmel with the message "this is what I
think you _meant_ to say."

That has attractions, especially since there are half a dozen different
firmware images for different hardware variants, and some cards have
flash and don't need loading at all. OTOH one of the my goals is to have 
the driver just there in the kernel, and not to need extra stuff to make
it work.
My current plan is to make separate modules for each firmware image so 
that people only need to compile in/load the one they need.

Without exception? Time to hit debian-legal, methinks.

Bah, more configuration. I want it to just _work_.
So, back to the question: what license for a binary firmware blob is 
GPL-compatible?
