The 486 emlation patch for 386 is the way to still allow 386's to run 
Debian.
To compile libstdc++ for 486 wasn't a performance question - a
libstdc++.so.5 compiled for 386 would have meant that C++ binaries
compiled on Debian wouldn't run on other Linux distributions and vice
versa [1] (it's a bug in libstdc++ that will AFAIR be fixed in gcc 3.4).
