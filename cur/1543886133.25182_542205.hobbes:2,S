No, its not solved.
Imagine I connect some device with its own LEDs and LED drivers. I'll
use "corgi:amber" as an example.
I run:
'cat /sys/class/leds/corgi:amber/triggers'
I see "hard" listed.
'echo "hard" > /sys/class/leds/corgi:amber/triggers'
doesn't work though...
If its not going to work, it shouldn't be listed.
Regards,
Richard
