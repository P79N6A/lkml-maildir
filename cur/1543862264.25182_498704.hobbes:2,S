Sorry that we were unclear about what happens in the case revocation
is not possible.  In those cases, the unsafe requested read or exec
that would normally trigger the demotion/revocation is denied, so
there is no way around the integrity model.
The goal of the low water mark integrity model is to be as transparent
as possible to the user. If the user asks for something to be done, we
allow it as much as possible, demoting the process as needed for
security.  If there is something that would need to be revoked, which
can't safely be revoked, then we deny the read/exec request, which is
secure, but possibly visible/annoying to the user. Fortunately in our
testing, there are only a few cases where this happens, and the
overall result is a model which is still much more transparent than
other models which don't allow demotion at all.
