You may want to try these tests again with linux-2.6.10-rc1-mm2.  It's
got 2 patches to fix some broken behavior of active_load_balance().  The
version of active_load_balance() in 2.6.9 was not considering a great
many CPUs as potential recipients of tasks due to some small logic
problems in the code.
