SLAB_DEBUG=y.  Nothing in the logs.

The SATA & SCSI controllers have no disks attached.  Firewire can be ignored (theres
no actual connector even for it on the board). The various USB controllers
are mostly unused. Only one of them is USB2.0, so that sees occasional
usb-storage use. Not noticed anything going bad there though.
