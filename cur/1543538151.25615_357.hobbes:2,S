It is not endianness per se, but endianness plus starting from either end
of larger units when allocating fields, and perhaps leaving padding in.
*Read* what they say.

The guarantee that structure fields are laid out in declaration order, and
the above language give rather strong guarantees. Not that everything will
automatically work the same on ia32 and sparc64, but with some care (look
at the kernel source before you for examples...) it does work.
