I'm happy to hear this, especially in the advent of the netfilter
develpoer workshop next week, and after a very long period of silence
from the nf-hipac project.
I'll make sure to have read through your 0.9.0 version source code until
then, to be able to give some feedback asap.
Looking forward to talking to you about it next week!
