Yes, I've browsed through these. __GFP_NOFAIL seems like it can hang for 
a very long time (I don't know if there is an upper bound on how long it 
will have to wait for a free page). __GFP_REPEAT seems to work good 
enough in this case.
My question was meant to be more along the lines of "Is there anything I 
can do without resorting to unstable/interal API:s?".
