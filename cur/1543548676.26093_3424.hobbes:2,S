I believe that the Netware elevator is based on outstanding requests. 
This is a tunable parameter which may be increased for fast disk 
subsystems.
I think that you could consider the number of requests to be loosely 
related to time. That is, the time to service 50 requests should be 
fairly predictable for a given disk/controller. I don't think you 
need to time stamp every request to get good results.
