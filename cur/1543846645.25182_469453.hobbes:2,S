Subject: Renicing mencoder to something lower than 0 causes (whole) system to stuck (cx88 chipset)

Hi,
I've already reported this to kraxel@bytesex.org which should be the  
maintainer's email
address (according Documentation/video4linux/...). I mailed this about 3  
weeks ago and got
no response at all, but I think that this issue might be interesting so I  
post it here again:
I've got an strange problem with mencoder from mplayer 1.0pre8 here  
(selfcompiled, linux kernel 2.6.17.1).
Running just mencoder to record from my TV card (cx88 chipset) works fine.
The card is a Hauppauge WinTV PCI-FM.
But when I renice it to a negative priority (-1 is enough to trigger it),  
the whole system (even all the linux text terminals with no X running)  
gets unresponsive and stucks every second or so for about a 0.5 seconds  
and mencoder drops more frames than before than without
renicing.
mencoder uses about 80% CPU but the problem occurs on "only" 60% CPU usage  
too. I tested an "endless loop program" if this is a general renicing  
problem, but it isn't, I would need
to renice an endless loop to something below about -10 to cause a stucking  
mencoder creates
at only -1.
Googling around didn't lead to any useful results, I've asked in #mplayer  
and #kernel
but no one knew an answer.
Someone in #mplayerdev suggested it's likely a kernel bug causing me to  
write this report.
If I renice mencoder to a positive value it works better than than to a  
negative and doesn't
cause the system to stuck. (This leads me to not touching the priority at  
all but there must
be a problem somwhere because everything stucks terribly. Of course,  
renicing to a positive
value makes no sense because I would drop frames if the system load goes  
up due to other processes. What I want to point out, that if I renice it  
to +1 it works _better_ than
renicing it to -1, because it starts to drop frames immediately if I  
renice it to something lower
than 0 even if the system load is only about 60%.)
