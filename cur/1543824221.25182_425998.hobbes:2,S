Maybe this helps: there is not too much the Xen code could be doing
wrong here. If I read your crash correctly it happend in the FORWARD
chain, which could mean that the outgoing device (probably the Xen
virtual network driver) has some bugs, but iptables really only cares
about the names at this point, which practically can't be bogus.
The only other thing I can imagine is that something is wrong with
the per-CPU copy of the ruleset, i.e. either smp_processor_id is
returning garbage or for_each_possible_cpu misses a CPU during
initialization. I have no idea if Xen really does touch this code,
but other than that I don't really see what it could break.
