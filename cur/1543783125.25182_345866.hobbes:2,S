JACK sources already include a CHECK_PREEMPTION() macro which expands
to Ingo's special gettimeofday() calls.  The trace is turned on and
then off automatically before and after the realtime critical section
in the process thread (see libjack/client.c).  
Ingo's suggested ALSA backend patch is not presently included.
There are probably some other places where these macros could usefully
be added.  We will integrate patches adding them in appropriate spots.
They do no harm in vanilla kernels without tracing enabled.
