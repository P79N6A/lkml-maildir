 joe: hi, thanks for responding.  i believe this to be a very
 sound strategy, and given the technical expertise of the kernel
 developers i have confidence in their abilities to pull that off.
 personally i find that i like a bit of a run-up and/or advance notice
 of major paradigm shifts.  on the basis that other people might also
 want to know, i initiated this discussion yesterday and it seems like
 forever already! :)

 oh, and joe?  my wife is the one with the high horse, not me.
 she qualified for the national british dressage championships which
 was last month, and came 17th in the country, at elementary
 level, on her beautiful pony, blue.  i am very proud of her.
