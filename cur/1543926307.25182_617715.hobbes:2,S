patch 05aa345034de6ae9c77fb93f6a796013641d57d5 in mainline.
SLUB: Fix memory leak by not reusing cpu_slab
Fix the memory leak that may occur when we attempt to reuse a cpu_slab
that was allocated while we reenabled interrupts in order to be able to
grow a slab cache. The per cpu freelist may contain objects and in that
situation we may overwrite the per cpu freelist pointer loosing objects.
This only occurs if we find that the concurrently allocated slab fits
our allocation needs.
If we simply always deactivate the slab then the freelist will be properly
reintegrated and the memory leak will go away.
