I can still hang the system with XMMS (1.0.1) using real-time priority.
The system doesn't die, but it is completely unresponsive. There is no
sound, but after the MP3 file is played, the system works again. I can
reproduce this behaviour with usb-uhci and uhci-alt on 2.4.0-test10.
I haven't test test11-pre3 yet, but the changes don't look too big that
the "bug" has been fixed.
BTW, I don't think this is a critical bug.
