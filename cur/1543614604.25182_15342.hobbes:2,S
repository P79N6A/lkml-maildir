Of course the patch will be updated when needed, but I still
have a few 6-month old patches lying around that still work
as expected and don't need any change.
I see absolutely no reason to not automate the resending of
these patches, once they need maintenance again I'll maintain
them.

Silently dropping bugfixes on the floor is not maintainership,
either.
