Since then, here's the highlights of what I've done so far:
ChangeSet@1.1510, 2004-01-30 11:14:44-07:00, trini@kernel.crashing.org
  Lots of changes to the serial stub driver.
  In sum, it's got many of the features (but not all) of George
  Anzginer's version (+ fix or two), and fully flushed out and tested
  support for SERIAL_IOMEM.
ChangeSet@1.1509, 2004-01-30 11:10:03-07:00, trini@kernel.crashing.org
  Change *kgdb_serial into kgdb_serial_driver.  We will now have
  only one serial driver.
ChangeSet@1.1508, 2004-01-30 10:44:55-07:00, trini@kernel.crashing.org
  Convert the kgdb ethernet driver over to netpoll.
  Patch from Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>, who warns this probably
  doesn't work.
ChangeSet@1.1505, 2004-01-29 14:30:47-07:00, trini@kernel.crashing.org
  Move all KGDB questions into kernel/Kconfig.kgdb.
ChangeSet@1.1504, 2004-01-27 16:59:06-07:00, trini@kernel.crashing.org
  - PPC32: Add KGDB support for PRePs (part of MULTIPLATFORM).
  - PPC32: Add a choice of baud rate for the gen550 backend.
ChangeSet@1.1503, 2004-01-27 14:44:54-07:00, trini@kernel.crashing.org
  Remove the function pointers from kgdb_ops.
  Most have become kgdb_foo, instead of foo.  The exceptions
  are the gdb/kgdb register fiddling functions.
  kgdb_gdb_regs_to_regs makes my head hurt.
ChangeSet@1.1502, 2004-01-27 11:46:13-07:00, trini@kernel.crashing.org
  Merge by hand to current 2.6 bk.
  --- UNTESTED, x86_64 might be broken ---
ChangeSet@1.1474.149.3, 2004-01-27 11:32:54-07:00, trini@kernel.crashing.org
  - Send a 'T' packet initially, not an 'S' followed by 'p'
  - On PPC32, try to pass in the correct signal back.
I'm mostly happy with the serial changes (and I'll set aside the user
console bits from George's version for now), but comments and criticisms
would be welcome.  And as a reminder the BitKeeper version is
bk://ppc.bkbits.net/linux-2.6-kgdb and there's snapshots (thanks Dave!)
