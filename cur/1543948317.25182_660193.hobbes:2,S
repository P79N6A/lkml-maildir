I'd call it "sleeping" or something like this, for it will also be used by
hibernation callbacks.

Why before?  I'd think that any non-suspended children should not be visible
by the partent's ->resume().

This seems to require some trickery.  Namely, device_add() will notice that
the registration is done concurrently with the running ->suspend() of the
parent and will have to communicate that to dpm_suspend() which is supposed
to resume the master in the next step.

How exactly do you want to check that?

Well, if the parent is a bus, that will be a problem.

I don't agree here.  If we require drivers to prevent such races from happening
and they don't comply, we can give up instead of trying to work around the
non-compilance.

That can't happen, because dev->sem is taken by suspend_device() and
device_del() would lock up attempting to acquire it once again.

I'm still thinking that registering while the parent is suspending should not
be allowed.

The direction seems to be fine, but the details need a bit more clarification,
as far as I'm concerned.  Having a patch to discuss will certainly help a lot,
though. ;-)
