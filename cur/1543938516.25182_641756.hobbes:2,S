I agree that board code should ideally not be there, however you can't
just drop it and hope nobody will notice. It needs to be done in such a
way that everything still works afterwards. IMHO it is better move such
changes to a later patch so as to not make this one needlessly complex.

That's bad, this should be fixed, if possible even before applying your
patches.
