Compression is skipped for the XIP files, which are typically marked via 
the sticky bit.  You'll also need a version of mkcramfs that creates the 
image without compressing those files.

It was measured on a 168MHz ARM 925T TI OMAP 1510.
Others' advice that "you probably don't want XIP" is true in most cases. 
  But in producing a battery-operated product with certain requirements 
for performance, power savings (due to reduced RAM requirements), 
startup time (depending on the platform and software stack the 
difference can be significant), etc. XIP is an option chosen by some CE 
designers, who are willing to accept the performance penalty on a 
product that will still run adequately for its intended uses.  It would 
be interesting to see an in-depth analysis of these topics on an actual 
Linux-based product such as a cell phone.  There are, of course, a 
number of ways to address all these issues, not just XIP...
