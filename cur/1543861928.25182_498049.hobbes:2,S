This will no longer work with the current state of things, as
$TOPDIR/.version keeps increasing.

These are completely different types of IDs. The .version number is a
local build ID and changes when one applies a local patch, or simply
changes a config option, and recompiles his/her kernel. The git ID of
course doesn't.
From the other comments in this thread, it looks like the build ID is
something many people are interested in, so we can't just drop it.
