Well, several reads of at least 172B... but that scenario works without any problems.

I just copied it from usbatm; it looks like this could be done using seq_file instead.

No special user space tool, I just want other people to be able to get the same useful line information from cxacru that most ADSL driver have. (I do have a small "cxacru-watch" program which execs "cmd.up" etc. on status changes, but that is just sent printks via syslog-ng).
It looks like the weird proc interface prevents my intention to allow ". /proc/net/atm/cxacru\:0" to work and set $LINE_STATUS etc., at least with bash:
open("/proc/net/atm/cxacru:0", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0444, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
read(3, "", 0)                          = 0
close(3)                                = 0
Does anyone have any thoughts on the output format? The standard usbatm output isn't going to be compatible with the above if a common MAC/AAL5 header were used.
When I have the time and can acquire another conexant usb modem for testing I'll fix the usbatm /proc interfaces. It would be also good if the module could reliably be reloaded - most (but not all) of the time it fails to initialise the device again.
There's still an issue with khubd going into a loop if the firmware doesn't exist or if the device is unplugged.
