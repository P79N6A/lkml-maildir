I just tried the fbcon for the first time yesterday, and was really
amazed. I was however, how shall we say, disappointed with the current
logo. I've made another one, which has your standard linux logo on it
and looks nice and clean and sober.
I'd like to submit the resulting linux_logo.h but would need
instructions. Do I send it to this list? Should I send it to someone
else? I don't read this list, so *please respond to me directly*, in
addition to the list so that people can see if already 5 million people
have answered me. :-)
Also, does anyone know why the logo is limited to 80x80? There's a
define somewhere about it (in asm/linux_logo.* or something... Can't
remember), and I was wondering what would happen if I just changed it
there. I realize that making it bigger eats up more memory (and probably
permanently, since it's in a static array), but making it, say, 200x80
instead would allow for something much nicer.
The logo is at

.
If there is interest for it, I can also submit a little C prog that
converts a .ppm file to the relevant part of linux_logo.h . So far I've
only done the color logo as I don't boot in mono (not even sure I can).
