	thanks i will try it out but this should not happen right ?? Any
ideas why this happens....???? isn't there any other way to fix this ???
(like giving a argument to the kernel in boot time) Could it be that the
bios gives irq 11 to the modem and later the serial driver gives it irq 4
??? (well i don't know if this is as this happens with 2.0.x and there is
no problem, later in /etc/rc.d/rc.local i give it a setserial /dev/modem
irq 11 and that fixs it)....
	BTW this is a little off topic but speaking of modems sometimes
when i'm connecting to the net the modem doesn't connect but then i can't
try again because the modem like "locks"itself...if i pick up the phone i
just hear a horrible noise worse the the one you hear when it has
connected and i can't use it anymore...programs say that the modem is busy
or some error....the worse is that to make the modem respond again i have
to hard reboot the machine.....my question here is is there other way to
make the modem respond that isn't rebooting the machine ?????
	Thanks for the answers..............
