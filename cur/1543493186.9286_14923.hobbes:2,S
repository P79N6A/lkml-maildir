Why is it suid named? Suid means you have all privileges you had
before _PLUS_ that of named.

What is uid of calling process? If it is not named, you have more
privileges than you think. Aha, you said calling uid is named. Why is
it suid, then?
>   uid=named
[BTW There are 4 different uids. In case your named is executed by user
pavel, named has euid = named, ruid = pavel and can choose any of
these  two.]

             ~ hmm, your bash is not executable by normal user, only
group root? Strange.

You forget a few: r/w access to /tmp, r/o access to rest of
filesystem.

Assuming attacker needs to do exec. Which is NOT true.

I'd use 
rwxr-xr-x root root     named*
, with capability headers, saying
   permitted bits=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE (only)
   inheritable bits=0
   effective bits=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
I do not need to mark named suid root. In this case, capability
headers are only _dropping_ privileges, and I need no suid root to do
that. So I can do your scenario without marking it suid root. [I
believe that you do not need to mark your executable sticky, btw.]
Aha, I'd need calling process have CAP_NET, and to change its uid to
named's before executing me. As calling process is expected to be
init, for me, it is uid=0 and all capabilities, so it is going to have
_also_ CAP_NET, and can change its uid easilly.
