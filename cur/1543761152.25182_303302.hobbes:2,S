Is it really easier if you have to be aware of _both_ the class reference
possibly having reached zero yet and the kref device reference
possibly having reached zero yet? Using your approach, you need to take 
_two_ lifetimes into account instead of one. Think of class device
attributes being opened / still being accessed when kref device reference 
reaching zero... you need to check for that in code now, AFAICS, while you 
could rely on "we still have a reference to the _device_" in "historic" 
class device attribute access paths.

The interface may get simpler, but we lose the advantages. And I prefer a
interface which reduces the chances of doing things wrongly; and at least
the existing warnings on empty release functions force you to _think_ about
what you do.

That's totally besides the point. If the decision was made to indeed do this
transition, I'd be all for doing this fast. If the "old" code was gone
within two weeks, I wouldn't care because of the short period, but because
of the functionality being lost:

the "functionality" of the device core to teach, encourage, and forcing to 
think of reference counting is being lost by this approach. Independent of
the question whether the transition will take two weeks or two years.

Keeping the chance to do the "new"/class_simple way is a good thing -- so
that anybody who _knows_ _exactly_ what he does can shoot himself in his
foot^W^W^W^W^W do what is best for the affected code.

	drivers/base/class_simple.c:
	....
	printk("are you really sure you don't want not to have reference counting for free by using struct class instead of struct class_simple *?\n");
	....
