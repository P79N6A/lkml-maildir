Sure.  And Milton and Olof have figured out what the problem is and
proposed patches to fix it.
However, I'm a bit annoyed that a significant change in behaviour like
that, with a significant likelihood of causing regressions, went in so
late (after -rc8), in a manner that affects all SMP architectures, and
without being posted to linux-arch (unless I missed it).
