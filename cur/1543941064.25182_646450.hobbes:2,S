Bill, FYI, there was a known issue with e1000 (fixed in 7.0.38-k2) and
socket charge due to truesize that kept one end or the other from
opening its window.  The result is not so great performance, and you
must upgrade the driver at both ends to fix it.
it was fixed in commit
9e2feace1acd38d7a3b1275f7f9f8a397d09040e
That commit itself needed a couple of follow on bug fixes, but the point
is that you could download 7.3.20 from sourceforge (which would compile
on your kernel) and compare the performance with it if you were
interested in a further experiment.
