I suppose it could make sense to move the two disk random source functions
together.

The problem with reordering things is that it makes the patch bigger, and that
makes people complain about not minimalising the changes.

What've you done with the real Christoph Hellwig?  You're actually *advocating*
the use of a cpp-conditional in a .c file!
It doesn't really belong in any of the files that are left.

Someone did.  Might've been USB storage now that I think about it.

No.
I'm not enabling a specific block device driver.  I'm taking out the entire
block layer, block drivers, block scheduler and everything that depends on it
(such as SCSI).
