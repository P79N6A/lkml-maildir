Having "all(tm)" information of something in one place?
Help-Text and Dependencies/Selects are already there.
I think adding the Maintainers-data is more or less a logical next step.
It's not always clear from the MAINTAINERS-file who is the right person
for what. Especially as it is a rather large text-file with only
mediocre search-friendlieness. It's a 3.5 K-lines file!
So when you know that you have a problem with drivers X, wouldn't it be
great if you could just "go to" the driver in *config and see not only
the Help-Text but the Maintainers-Data also.
And you can place "Fallback"-Maintainers-Data on Tree-Parents, for the
cases where you only can pinpoint a area, like when you have a problem
with a USB-device.
I can ask a rhetorical question too:
Why not go back to Config.help. Having a huge X K-Lines file with
everything in one file can't be that bad. It worked before!

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated,
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
