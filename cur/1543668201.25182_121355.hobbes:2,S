OK, I can see how ps may be doing a bad job there. It can do
better, e.g. from I can identify a process using something like:
	grep btime /proc/stat
		time machine booted (secs since 1970 probably)
	cut -d' ' -f22 </proc/$pid/stat
		process start time (jiffies since boot)
and if I really want I can convert start_time to seconds and have
a value (the sum of the two) that does not change.
From a user program, and not depending on /proc, I do not see
how I can access the kernel 'xtime' and 'task->start_time'.
