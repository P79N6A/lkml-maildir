Subject: 2.4.23 : timeouts and lost interrupts using IDE-SCSI

Since upgrading from 2.4.20 to 2.4.23, I can no longer mount my ATAPI CDROM and
CDR/W drives using IDE-SCSI.  Attempts to mount those drives result in
lost interrupts messages:
Dec  3 08:21:10 kaon kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 2114, scs
i2, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 Read (10) 00 00 00 00 10 00 00 01 00

Kernel is able to successfully probe for and identify these devices, however:

I can revert back to 2.4.20 and the drives are mountable once again so I do not
believe it's a hardware failure.  Similarly, I can build 2.4.23 with IDE CDROM
support instead of relying on SCSI emulation and things work (though I suspect
not having SCSI emulation enabled will cause problems when burning CDs).
System specs:
IBM Intellistation MPro
SMP P2-400 (2 CPUs)
440BX chipset
ACPI automatically disabled "because your bios is from 98 and too old"
CDROM as hdc, CDR/W as hdd
   both these devices are attached to the onboard PIIX4 controller
kernels compiled with gcc 2.95.3
