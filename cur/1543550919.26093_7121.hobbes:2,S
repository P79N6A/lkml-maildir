I do use PINE, and I still think QP is buggy and a stupid excersize. Mail
delivery should have been cleaned up, not the user agent. You could have
done the equivalent of QP inside sendmail, and none of the stupid QP
issues would ever ever have happened (sure, people with old sendmails
would have seen the QP-encoding, but that's THEIR problem).
I save mails with "save". Not "save attachement". And pine will save the
raw mail.
Repeat after me: QP is evil. Most of the time these days nobody needs to
care any more, but that doesn't change the fact that QP is the DOS of
email: backwards compatibility crap that should not have been there.
