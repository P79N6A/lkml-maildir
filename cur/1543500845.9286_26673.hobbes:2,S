I have noticed some complete freezes on 2.2.10 too, the system was simply death.
The strange thing was that the NFS server was hanging at the same time, also a
2.2.10 kernel.
My workstation (PII-350 UP) was compiled with egcs; the server (P-200MMX UP) was
compiled with gcc...
Don't know if you are also running NFS... but had the problem twice: sorry no
data, complete freez, nothing in the log...
