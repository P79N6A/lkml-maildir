grep -r shows that it's ACPI which declares this "motherboard" name. I
seem to remember about a change in the ACPI resource reservation. You
might want to check with Len or Marcelo. I believe you cannot disable

Maybe you can hack the driver if you absolutely need to load 2.4.28+TCO.
Simply comment out the "return -EIO" at line 402. It will still print
the message but should load.
