Your problem is the same as Martin Lucina had, and I can reply the same as

The test shows that there is a deep misunderstanding of how works
MIR mode, and chaining blocks for optimization at MIR mode.
some people say "MIR works" . That is good for them.
I would prefer to have "#undef USE_MIR"
So, test is not necessary for every day use. Just put
options donauboe do_probe=0
in your /etc/modules.conf
