problem is when you detect it...

to give users more times means that most users will wait more time, but
won't take any action to prevent data loss.
on the other side, I doubt home users are really sensitive about
performances. they do care about performances, but I do not know if they
are able to evaluate performances as well.
even for servers, if they are not stressed, it is difficoult with modern
hardware to evaluate I/O performances.

My experience taught me they aren't.
but they complain anyway.
