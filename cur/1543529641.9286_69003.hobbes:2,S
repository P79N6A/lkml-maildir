Exactly. That's the whole point. Only the _rate_ is interesting (the
number of faults is non interesting obviously). And even the rate can be
uninteresting if the task is not doing a page fault since yesterday (see
underlined line in my previous email quoted above).
Between the tasks that are faulting recently (say in the last 30 seconds)
the one which has the huge fault rate is the one to kill. That's what I'll
try out very soon. I believe it will work fine.

kswapd can't do page faults.
For syslogd if it has a higher page fault _rate_ than all the other tasks
it's also probably the hog (it may had a bug that caused it to exploed)  
and it's right to kill it.
The only delicate thing to get right is the collapse time, when the system
is oom and almost dead. At that time the page fault rate decrease to once
fault per looots of time. We'll have to use a well tuned histeresis on the
page fault rate calculation to avoid to get fooled by the very low fault
rate during mem collapse.

Once we'll have the page fault rate and the time of the last fault, we can
also make them available via /proc for statistic purposes btw.
