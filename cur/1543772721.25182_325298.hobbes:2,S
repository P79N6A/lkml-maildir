Certainly good advice, but...
In this instance, I was speculating not about what various RT apps might
need, but instead about what Karim was getting at.  And I have seen cases
where people needed realtime (as in deterministic) I/O, networking stacks,
and the like, so that part is not speculation.
Whether or not deterministic implementations of I/O, networking stacks,
and the like should ever be included in Linux certainly -is- speculation
at this point, but, as I said in my earlier email, there are plenty of
things to worry about before we get to that point.

The futex/fusyn work is on my list, not for speculation, but rather
for looking at what they have, what it does, how it fits in, and how it
appears to be doing.  My reason for looking into it is that I have
also seen people saying that they need priority inheritance in user-level
mutexes.
I would of course be quite interested in your thoughts on futex/fusyn!
