Ok, the combination which freezes the computer is right SHIFT, and
pageup/down, etc. Left SHIFT works just like expected. This time I first
wrote 'cp /var/log/syslog /tmp/syslog', then 'echo cut-here >
/var/log/syslog' Left-SHIFT+PAGEUP, arrow up two times, to get the cp..,
enter. Then I edited /tmp/syslog and copied only what was after
"cut-here". So the keystrokes included here should be Left-SHIFT+PAGEUP,
ARROW-UP, ARROW-UP, ENTER. If this works like I think it should. As you
can see, it did not generate an "Unknown scancode"...

Hope this helps, even though I doubt. It's only the right-SHIFT causing troubles.
Thanks.
