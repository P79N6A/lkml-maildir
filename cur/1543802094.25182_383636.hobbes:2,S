Write it yourself.  It's git-fetch + git-diff.
Or, put another way, if you think you need a special tool for working
with a remote repository, you don't understand git-fetch.
Since git history is immutable, there is no difference between a remote
copy and a local copy.  And since fetching is harmless to your local
repository, there's no problem.
If you don't want to copy the entire history, just fetch the tree rather
than the commit.  (Does git-fetch do that?  It's a subset of its current
effects, so would be an easy enough extension.)
