mmm, my changelog is slightly narrow than it should be.
	Non-emergency code is traversing modules list.
	It finds "struct module *".
	module is removed.
	"struct module *" is now meaningless, but still dereferenced.
How would all this refrigerator stuff would help? It wouldn't,
	Non-emergency code is traversing modules list.
	It finds "struct module *".
	Everything is freezed.
	Module is removed.
	Everything is unfreezed.

Yes. FWIW,
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y
I very much agree with proto-patch which _copies_ all relevant
information into caller-supplied structure, keeping module_mutex private.
Time to split it sanely.
