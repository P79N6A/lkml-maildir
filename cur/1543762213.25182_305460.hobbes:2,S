No. It uses the kref_inc() and kref_dec(), which do not have the
equivalent atomic_dec_and_lock() primitives.

Could be for now. I'd like to convert more of the kobject/kest mess to use
a cleaner, and rwsem-free locking mechanism, which would nearly justify it
in lib/. All in all, that change is purely cosmetic.
