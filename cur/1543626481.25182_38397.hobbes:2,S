Alan,
I don't want to try your patience but I have to emphasize that:
yes, it should be authors decision (completely agree with you there!)
whether a symbol is exported or not and whether it should be exported to
all modules or only to some "internal/kernel" modules. But this is a
technical issue, nothing to do with legalities/licenses or author's likes
or dislikes of binary modules.
But if the author's decision is based on a statement similar to "I spent N
hours writing this function, it's okay to let GPL modules use it but no
way I'll let the nasty veritas-like people use it", then I feel something
is wrong somewhere. Then perhaps we could even refine the API to have
EXPORT_SYMBOL_FRIENDS(sym,list_of_friends)
where only "friends" can use the symbol and even then only if they first
call (an exported function):
register_export_payment(sym, sum);
where 'sum' depends on the number of hours spent on writing sym().
I feared that perhaps I misunderstood the meaning of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL but
in the other "instance" of this thread Linus did confirm that it was
correct.
Regards,
Tigran
PS. unimportant detail for curious listeners on linux-kernel -- Veritas
doesn't actually need vmalloc_to_page exported in any manner or form.
