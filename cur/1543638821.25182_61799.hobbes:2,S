The write_times patch fixes a lot of latency problems, but all 5 of my
patches kind of build on each other to solve problems in different
workloads.

This is harder to guess at ;-)  But I'll try 2 things I know I've fixed.
#1 I've made the metadata writeback code much more efficient, especially
for smaller transactions.  A dd to a large file won't generate lots of
log traffic, writing 700M only changes about 160 blocks in 30 seconds. 
Anyway, 03-data-logging-24 might make a big difference.
#2 During an ls, the current code ends up reading the directory more or
less one block at a time.  Try 05-search_reada-4.diff, which will read
more tree nodes at once.
If that still doesn't work, I'm porting forward some reiserfs
low-latency work that andrew morton did, we can give it a try.
