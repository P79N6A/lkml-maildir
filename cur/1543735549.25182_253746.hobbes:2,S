   True. But udev together with new loadable modules model was

   You are right - kernel doesn't know.
   It is driver knows, It is user of driver who does know it too.

   Well, go to /etc/rc.d and try to integrate that with rest of system.
   The only right way of handling of such stuff I know - is FSM.
   Implementing FSMs in shell scripts - last thing I ever wanted. And I 
still cannot get how you are going to safely serialize /etc/dev.d/ 
callbacks against /etc/rc.d/ without polling.

   Untrue. Driver if something fails have a chance to return error from 
module_init() function, which will be passed to modprobe and then to callee.

   You are wrong. Hardware driver must fail, when hardware is not 
present/not detected. Simple as that.
   If ide-cd doesn't do that - it needs to be fixed.

   Yes. Driver is not loaded without need. Kernel doesn't need driver - 
user need it to accomplish specific task.
   User knows what driver is meant for, especially when it loads it 
manually.
   If user will be told when driver is ready - user can verify that 
hardware in question is present.

   What about scripts outside of /etc/dev.d/?
   If you ever mantained /etc/rc.d/rc - you will understand what I mean. 
Splitting system boot-up procedure will have some funny consequences. 
Debugging will be left as an execise for end-users. Running once fsck 
simultaneously on several partitions will cool your temper down.
   Again. FSM is no way to go for shell scripts. And shell scripts is 
what is used to manage system. Even /etc/dev.d/ scripts - are shell 
scripts, after all.
P.S. If you will add errors to /etc/dev.d/ scripts - than you will 
really end up with FSMs in shell scripts. You are welcome to try. I did 
once and failed.
P.P.S. Well, I will stop trolling. Honestly. Promise.
