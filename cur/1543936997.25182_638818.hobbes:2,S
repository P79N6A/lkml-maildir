 config X86_ELAN
        bool "AMD Elan"
        depends on X86_32

          Select this for an AMD Elan processor.
Hmmm... Most options like "support 386" are of "add support for 386,
but do not break support for pentium". ELAN etc seem to be
exceptions. Perhaps options that _take away_ functionality (like ELAN
-- takes ability to boot on normal 386)  should be specifically marked
somehow?
depends on EXCLUSIVE_FEATURE
?
depends on NOT_A_FEATURE
?
