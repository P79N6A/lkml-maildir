IMHO uClinux is a workaround the problem that the standard kernel 
needs a 32bit CPU and a MMU.

Absolutely ACK. Especially since "embedded systems" nowadays may come 
with integrated (net-)snmp agents, a web server+CGI scripts or some 
pseudo-shell for configuration, image download via tftp/ftp/http/
[xyz]modem, etc.
Then you want to use a MMU and try to convince product mgmt/whoever
to get a MMU on the device.
