Subject: [PATCH 1/2] dgrs: remove from build, config, and maintainer list
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Stop building and configuring driver for Digi RightSwitch, which was 
never actually sold to anyone, and remove it from MAINTAINERS.
In response to an investigation into the firmware of the "Digi Rightswitch" 
driver, Andres Salomon discovered:

Since the product never reached market, clearly nobody is using this orphaned 
driver.

This is patch 1 of 2 for removing the "Digi Rightswitch" (dgrs).
Patch 2 would be the patch to remove the actual files.  However, that would
be around 400K, which doesn't seem suitable for a mailing list -- and this 
length seems quite unnecessary, given that it would consist solely of full-file 
deletions.  I'm not quite sure what to do about this.  Please advise.
These are the files to be deleted:
./Documentation/networking/dgrs.txt
./drivers/net/dgrs.c
./drivers/net/dgrs.h
./drivers/net/dgrs_asstruct.h
./drivers/net/dgrs_bcomm.h
./drivers/net/dgrs_es4h.h
