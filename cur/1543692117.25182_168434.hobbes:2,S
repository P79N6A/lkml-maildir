Okay, a little fresh data:
I just had the keyboard key sticking problem occur, 2.6.0-test5-mm4.

The page down key is the one that stuck.  I pressed another key (possibly 
either cursor up or page up) to unstick it, and then the next time I pressed 
page down it didn't register, but the time after that it did.
Checking the log, I saw the above message.  This is the first time since the 
last reboot the problem has occurred, and the first such message since the 
last reboot.  The message IS occurring when I have the key sticking problem, 
as shown by the timestamps.
You're talking about missed keypresses, but the end-user symptom I'm seeing is 
definitely a missed key release, and it's associated with the above log 
message.
