So what you are saying is that the scheduler changed after 2.3.9 to make the
forks faster under high load? Will those changes make it to 2.4 ?
Could somebody also elaborate on "the scheduler penalizes across forks" for
those who are not as familiar with the kernel internals/jargon? Does that mean
that a process that has called fork()/clone() automatically gets punished for
this great sin by getting its priority lowered? 
If the above is correct, how long does the punishment last?
