It works fine here. I think the reason that they are not pushing
to get it included in the standard kernel yet, is that the main
use for UDF is with CD/DVD writable devices. And that isn't
quite done yet - but it is a work in progress. A quick estimate
for a working alpha patch is sometime next month. Take a look
at my page, I'll post progress reports there.
