Subject: Block I/O Schedulers: Can they be made selectable/device? @runtime?

Is it still the case that block I/O schedulers (AS, CFQ, etc.)
are only selectable at boot time?
How difficult would it be to allow multiple, concurrent I/O
schedulers running on different block devices?
How close is the kernel to "being there"?  I.e. if someone has a
"regular" hard disk and a high-end solid state disk, can
Linux allow whichever algorithm is best for the hardware?
(or applications if they are run on separate block devices)?
