It's more comfortable for the reviewer to send a mail reply with the tag.
But modifications after review are a problem either way.  (If the
modifications are minor, add a description below the Reviewed-by and
sign off below that additional description.  If they are major, drop the
Reviewed-by.  However, a follow-up patch instead of modifying the
reviewed patch should be considered and may be suitable in many cases,
since a patch which passed review should already be fine for commit on
its own.)
