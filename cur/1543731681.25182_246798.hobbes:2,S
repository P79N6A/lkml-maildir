It works very well for some users without that code. The raw pass
through for the compressed bitstreams solved the problems for the rest.
You appear to be seeking to hurt your userbase for your own ends. Thats
not pleasant behaviour.  I can more than understand
"take my name off it, make it clear its nothing to do with me".

Video4linux has -always- specified decompressors in user space. This was
pointed out ages ago. V4L2 rationalised it even more clearly.

No its for userspace. Just add it to the relevant video frameworks.

Back in 2001 I was saying that this was broken and it belonged in user
space.

There isn't a plan to have a 2.7 development tree but to do gradual
development until something major comes up. That makes the suggestion
rather more tricky - as does the legal question.
