Not that technical:   "Unlike most older busses, USB monitors connection
state during suspend states.  It does this by using an active electical
circuit, which is broken by swsusp.  USB detects that broken circuit
and thus reports the device's disconnection."
And why does that matter?  For stateless devices like most mice and
keyboards, it doesn't.  For a disk with a mounted file system, it does
since (a) there's no trustworthy way to tell if a disk that's there on
resume is the same one that was there on suspend, while (b) wrongly
assuming it's the same *WILL* quickly lead to data corruption.

Most PCs maintain the USB connections during suspend-to-RAM; ISTR seeing
some hardware design guidelines from SFT saying to do it that way, so that
remote wakeup works.  (E.g. on systems with only USB keyboards and mice,
you want wakeup to be natural.)
Some laptops (to eke out a bit more battery life) and embedded systems
(where STR is the deepest suspend state) do drop USB power during STR.
In my observation, hardly any PCs drop USB power like that.

A mechanism that's this dangerous deserves to be discouraged much more
strongly, if it's even merged.  (I'm not a big fan of giving people
quite that much rope.)  Having it depend on CONFIG_EMBEDDED as well as
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL (or better yet CONFIG_DANGEROUS) seems a better route...

I'll disagree on the "only himself to blame".  If this mechanism is trivial
to kick in, it will be kicked in even by (or on behalf of) users that have
no reason to understand how dangerous this is.

No ... it's normally 500 uA, or for high powered devices up to 2500 uA.
The specification is a per-device average over 1 second, not per bus.
Some root hubs ("busses") support ten directly-connected devices, which
implies 25 mA would be needed on top of whatever the controller itself
is consuming.  (You'd think it only needs some comparators and trivial
unclocked logic, but for some reason that seems uncommon.)

That's called a BUG ... firmware shouldn't have reset any device
that the OS was managing.  And in fact during true system suspend
states, I've not heard any reports of a BIOS resetting a USB host
controller.  Do you have examples of these "many" systems??
(Any swsusp case is not one of these, since that's not a true
suspend mechanism.  The hardware really did get reset, and BIOS
init can't be bypassed if it's going to let users do basics like
using a usb keyboard to choose which OS to run.)

      "some" ... by numbers, not very many since ISTR it's against
the hardware design guidelines from MSFT.

Just like for ** ALL ** other kinds of removable media, on any system
where userspace isn't facilitating data corruption.

You're understating this.  I really think that such a mechanism would
need to be explicitly configured into the kernel.  Distros that want
to cope with all the end-user "your kernel trashed my disk!!" service
calls could do so ... others would keep that option off, and save lots
of customer support and end user pain.

Actually, most end users would never read this information, so they
will never get such a warning.
