I knew RH8.0 has set_cpus_allowed(), but I wanted to avoid having to check
for being compiled in a RH-hacked kernel. LINUX_VERSION_CODE doesn't
distinguish between standard and "with tons of vendor-specific changes" :-(
I'll use your code then on stock 2.4 kernels, and work out some kludge
for the RH case.
Thanks,
