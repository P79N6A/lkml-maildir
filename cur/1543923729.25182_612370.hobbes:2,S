Just because they didn't think about cpuset remapping when they coded
their mempolicy calls, doesn't mean they wouldn't be broken by changes
in how mempolicy numbers nodes.  Often, it's the other way around:
the less they though of it, the more likely changing it would break
them.

No - I will not agree to changing the default mempolicy kernel API node
numbering at this time.  Period.  Full stop.  We can add non-default
choices for now, and perhaps in the light of future experience, we
may choose to do more later.

No, they may or may not be broken.  That depends on whether or not they had
specific hardware locality or affinity needs.

If you're running apps that have specific hardware affinity requirements,
then perhaps you shouldn't be moving them about in the first place ;).
And if they did have such needs, aren't they just as likely to be busted
by AND'ing off some of their nodes as they are by remapping those nodes?
I sure wish I knew what real world, actual, not hypothetical, situations
were motivating this.
