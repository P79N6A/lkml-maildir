I'd suggest _only_ changing the i386 version.
For example, your asm-generic changes looks senseless, since they only
make the macros more complex, without actually changing anything. And the
other architectures may want to do other things, since right now at least
some of them use things like fixed hardware registers etc which is not
necessarily appropriate for the non-asm case...
That way you'd also only modify the architecture that you can actually 
verify..
