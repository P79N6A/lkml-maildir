I should say that after my post, I tried out the linuxppc-2.5 2.5.66
tree at 
http://www.penguinppc.org/dev/kernel.shtml,
 and it did not
have this problem.
However, I could not get it to compile for numerous other reasons:
 * If PnP BIOS is enabled, it fails to compile the x86 assembler.
 * All Modules fail to load due to some sort of missing symbol (sorry, I
   didn't take notes) Q_MODULE or something maybe.
 * A non-module-enabled kernel fails to build, complaining of a
   missing isa_virt_to_bus symbol.  And that happened even after I
   enabled the unnecessary ISA support.
 * hdparm causes a kernel oops and apparent lockup (again, I didn't
   take notes, I was just trying to make the darn thing boot)
In short, 2.5 on PowerPC does not seem to be in a very good state
right now.
