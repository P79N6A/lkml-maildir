I'm not sure I follow you here.  Do you want to completely separate the
inflate and deflate stuff (so if something only needs one, it only has
to include one)?  I'm not sure of the value, and it would be kind of a
pain for maintenance (since zlib is from an external source).
As far as memory management, all the versions I am talking about are
almost exactly the same, so that shouldn't be a problem.
