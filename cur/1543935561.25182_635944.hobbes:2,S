Oh, yeah.  That's bitten me before, but I guess I lost that part of the 
patch somewhere :(.

It's pretty awful.  The pagetable level folding stuff is fairly deep 
into "too clever" territory, but its hard to see what better 
alternatives there are...  Dropping non-PAE support would be nice, but 
impractical given that even relatively recent chips are missing support 
for it.
