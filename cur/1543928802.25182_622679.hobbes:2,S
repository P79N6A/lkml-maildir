Ah, but I could write a sequence of pages that on their own looked
garbage, but in reality, when executed would print out a copy of the
Jargon File in all its glory. And if you still think you could look for
patterns, how about executable code that self-modifies in random ways
but when executed as a whole actually has the functionality of fetchmail
embedded within it? How would you guard against that?
