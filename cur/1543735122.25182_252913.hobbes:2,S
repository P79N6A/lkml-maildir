but ... frame pointers are overhead to all of the kernel. (the overhead
is less pronounced on architectures with more registers, but even with
15 registers, 14 or 15 can still be a difference.) While unwinding is
overhead to profiling only - if enabled. Also, there could be other
functionality (exception handling?) that could benefit from dwarf2
unwinding.
