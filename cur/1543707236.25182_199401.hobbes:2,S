Hello,
I'm getting some strange behavior while trying to rmmod a module from my
2.4.21 kernel. Each call to "rmmod" segfaults, leaving the module usage count
incremented. This doesn't seem like something that is supposed to happen,
but I can't understand what the problem is.
When I strace rmmod, the last few lines are:
  query_module(NULL, QM_MODULES, { /* 5 entries */ }, 5) = 0
  query_module("serial", QM_INFO, {address=0xd8816000, size=43620, flags=MOD_RUNNING, usecount=14}, 16) = 0
  query_module( <unfinished ...>
  +++ killed by SIGSEGV +++
I haven't wanted to reboot yet, so I don't know how reproducible this is. (In
fact, I've used this module often on this kernel in the past, and haven't
seen this problem before.) Is there something obvious I am missing?
Thanks,
mdr
