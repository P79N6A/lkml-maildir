I wanted to start with a simple implementation first. There are a couple
of things that can be done in future to further improve meory usage: (1)
Drop "CONFIG_" and "# CONFIG_" from each line and add it back when
printing from /proc/ikconfig and extract-ikconfig script, (2) Compress
the resulting configuration. Something to do in near future :)
