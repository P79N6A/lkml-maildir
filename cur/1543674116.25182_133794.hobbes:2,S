           Summary: Consistent crash on kernel startup
    Kernel Version: 2.5.69-bk12
            Status: NEW
          Severity: high
             Owner: davej@codemonkey.org.uk
         Submitter: mhughes@mhughes.dhs.org
Distribution: red hat 8.0
Hardware Environment:Athlon XP1900 
Software Environment:gcc 3.2
Problem Description:oops on kernel startup - soon after lilo prompt
Steps to reproduce: try to boot 2.5.69-bk12 (.config that worked well with 2.5.67)
I couldn't scroll back through the oops - hope this is enough info. This crashed
3 times in a row, so I should be able to reproduce easily if I can add info. I
copied the oops by hand off the console, so I may have missed something or
mis-copied something - ask if something looks odd ...
Oops looked like:
esi: 0x01 edi: 0xc15cf540 ebp: 0xdff7fee4 esp: 0xdff7fed0
ds: 0x007b es: 0x007b ss: 0x0068
Process swapper(pid:1)
Call Trace:

If I can provide any more info, feel free to let me know ... this one seems
easy to reproduce. If this is a duplicate, apologies ...
