I want to narrow down the discussion, I believe that some people could 
get confused with the mention of "file" here. AFAICT, the above problem 
only concerns the shared libraries. Digsig applies only to binaries: in 
digsig_file_mmap() implementing the file_mmap LSM hook, if the file is 
not executable there is a return and no verification or any other 
blocking is done.
For executables, there is no meaning to load them on read mode, you 
should have execute permission. if you then load them for execution 
IMHO, it makes sense to block the writing on that file.
For shared libraries, you're right. the problem exists, the shared 
libraries can be loaded being only readable (even though I remember 
reading in exec.c:sys_uselib() kernel 2.6.8.1 that the shared libraries 
must be both readable and executable due to "security reasons", but I'm 
not an expert and definitely readable is enough to load the shared 
library but I'll be happy to learn more about this.)

My 2 cents, a quick browsing on my machine (fedora core 1) shows that 
almost all my shared libraries are installed with both execution and 
read permissions.  IMHO, I don't believe then that this should be 
considered as a major issue.
