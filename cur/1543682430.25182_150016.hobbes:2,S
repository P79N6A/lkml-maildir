Just to try to help, as suggested by Karol Kasimor, disabling the APIC 
make the code pass this section. The APIC is now really unconditionnaly 
enabled (regardless of BIOS settings) due to this change in 2.5.74...

So this is an interaction between APIC and ACPI... I still think it 
should not crash at least...
BTW : I still cannot boot as the radeon framebuffer driver make things 
unreable. I will stcik with 2.4 for a while...
