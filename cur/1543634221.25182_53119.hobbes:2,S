Seems that I screwed up that version a bit ;( 
For now, don't use something like "make dep clean bzImage", but rather
"make clean; make dep bzImage" - it'll work again in the next release,
though.
Modversions also have bugs, though I can't see how they lead to the effect 
you describe. Anyway, try changing CONFIG_MODVERSIONS to off for now,
again, it should work again in the next release.
Let me know of further problems ;)
