For SCSI, as far as the basics go we still have
Need to convert to DMA-mapping:
	am53c974 dpt_i2o initio pci2220i
Don't compile currently:
	inia100 cpqfc pci2000 dc390t
Need converting to the new eh:
	wd33c99 based: a2091 a3000 gpv11 mvme174 sgiwd93 
	53c7xx based: amiga7xxx bvme6000 mvme16x
	initio am53c974 pci2000 pci2220i qla1280 sym53c8xx dc390t
I think the sym53c8xx could probably be pulled out of the tree because
the sym_2 replaces it.  I'm also looking at converting the qla1280.
It also might be possible to shift the 53c7xx based drivers over to
53c700 which does the new EH stuff, but I don't have the hardware to
check such a shift.
For the non-compiling stuff, I've probably missed a few that just aren't
compilable on my platforms, so any updates would be welcome.  Also, are
some of our non-compiling or unconverted drivers obsolete?
