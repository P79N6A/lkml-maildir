As you mentioned in your mail, you are using lzo1x_1_11_compress()
which is slower than what I ported (which is same as what is exported
by miniLZO). So, can you please test with the version ported  - this
is found in lzo/src/lzo1x_1.c (or in minilzo.c).
Also, can you please use 'take 5' for your next testing?
Thanks,
Nitin
