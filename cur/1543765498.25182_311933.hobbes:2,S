I have discovered several previously unknown emu10k1 hardware features
using this procedure to reverse engineer the Windows drivers, including
a per channel half loop interrupt, and added support to the Linux driver
for some of them.
It may be much easier to find the read and write register subroutines
than in the above guide.  The Windows driver I was working with had
exactly one subroutine that used the inb, inl, inw, outb, outw, outl
instructions, so it was trivial to set breakpoints to log all the port
I/O.  I later found it was even easier, the version of SoftIce I was
using allows you to set I/O breakpoints, so all you need to start
logging the register activity is the port.
I had a little trouble loading the IDA symbols into SoftICE at first,
just because the first few scripts I found on the net didn't work.
Some devices use memory mapped IO, I have no idea how you would RE
these.  Maybe someone else has some pointers?
