Looking at the documentation at
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_wait.txt,
 I noticed that the
description for epoll_wait states:  "On success, epoll_wait(2) returns the
number of file descriptors ready for the requested I/O."  My question is if
I have, for example, 1000 sockets registered with epoll and 100 of them have
received data and I call epoll_wait with max_events set to 10, will
epoll_wait return 10 or 100?  Furthermore, does the edge-triggered nature of
epoll "eat the edge" for the other 90 sockets even though they didn't get
returned?  Finally, if those 10 sockets get more data before I call
epoll_wait with max_events = 10 again, will those same 10 sockets get
returned?
