What I'm saying is that a flag set prior to prepare() would be almost
impossible to get right in term of locking for the reasons I explained.
I think this should be under driver reponsibility, using it's own
internal locking. Or else, drivers can rely on failure.

By the precise error code of course. But as I said, I would expect most
bus drivers to have their own proper implementation that does the right
thing, it's not like it was hard and there aren't that many bus drivers.
Relying on failure is a possibility for simple ones that don't want to
care much, in which case, there is little need to differenciate the
failure caused by suspend from other failures other than maybe printing
some garbage in the log vs. not :-)
