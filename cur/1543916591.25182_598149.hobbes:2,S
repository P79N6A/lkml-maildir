ah, i was wondering about that already. We can certainly skip that

yeah, it's not worth it. I'd go for keeping the code unified even if 
adds a few instructions runtime overhead, as i'd expect most distros to 
enable fair-group-scheduling by default in the future. (once all the 
containers infrastructure and tools has trickled down to them)
