Even thought the help for CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE says to leave blank, I 
was eventually able to get it to compile by setting 
CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE="/usr/src/linux/usr/initramfs_list".
I thought about it later and maybe having KBUILD_OUTPUT set caused the 
problem in the first place.
Unfortunately, I couldn't test this because I made my system unbootable 
with a new ivtv module :(
