Cool.  Thanks.

(Serves me right for still having Red Hat 7.2 on my laptop.  Old man pages.  
Now I've got to find a new project to force myelf to learn VFS internals.  Oh 
well... :)
(Nit-pick:  the man page description of umount -l doesn't look like it'd help 
with the removable media problem, I.E. "umount --gimme_my_cd_back_NOW", but 
the code may disagree, and the discussion's already turned up a 2.4 patch 
from Tirgran via Hugh Dickens, so I'll shut up now. :)
