I think that is not true.  __make_request will call the request function
anytime a request is added and the queue is not plugged.  Since plugging
only happens when the queue is empty, a block driver with requests sitting
on the queue can, in fact, see multiple calls to the request function.  I
was able to demonstrate this to myself in a test driver by introducing a
suitably long delay before actually removing requests from the queue.

Really?  From ll_rw_blk.c:

From that I had concluded that leaving requests on the queue was cool - as
long as they don't stay there forever.  A number of drivers seem to work
that way - the floppy driver, for example, doesn't bother to dequeue
requests until they are done.

One may be able to "get away" with it now - but should I advise people to
do things that way in the driver book?  My inclination is to tell people to
be a bit more careful.
Thanks muhc for your help on this matter...  with luck I'll actually get
all this stuff straight before long.
