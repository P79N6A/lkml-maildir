Hi all,
I have a little question...
Summary of changes from v2.4.21-pre4 to v2.4.21-pre5
============================================
Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>:
   o ACPI apparently wasnt bios
   o fix wrong date in microcode comment
   o add another legitimate P4 type
   o must disallow write combine on 450NX
   o add framework for ndelay (nanoseconds)
   o first block of parisc resend
   o second block of parisc merge
   o third block of parisc merge
   o Ian Nelson moved
   o update videobook docs to avoid check_region
   o docs for IPMI
   o remove dead init call
   o add AMD hammer rng
   o IPMI driver updates
   o keyboard changes
   o fix wrong test in raw driver
   o fix paths for ide
   o clarify hpt37x config
   o fix more ide paths
   o Paul's fix to do ide_cs handling in task context
   o more ide paths
   o fix use of check_region in umc driver
   o more ide comment/doc info updates
   o promise printk cleanups
   o another wrong path
   o IDE printk/cleanup bits
   o fix padding on eepro driver
In this patch, is it possible that there is a problem in the fix of 
eepro driver? Since I upgrade the kernel with 2.4.20-8 (kernel-source 
tag in debian) which include this patch I have some problem with packets 
which are sometimes truncated... (the server runs an ircd and the result 
is a delink).

If I do a rollback, no more problems... I don't test yet a 2.4.21 kernel.
Hardware is a Dell PowerAppWeb 120A with one CPU P3 1 GHz / 256 Mo RAM /
Now Kernel is generated under debian with kernel-source-2.4.20-2 and gcc 
version 2.95.4 20011002.
Any idea? (Thanks for your help)
