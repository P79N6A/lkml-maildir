I'm a little slow coming up to speed on these benchmarks.
dbench and tbench are measured in megabytes per second correct?
kernbench is the number of seconds it takes to compile a kernel?
reaim is measured in jobs per minute?
So if I read this right the differences are currently in
the noise levels, from your testing.
