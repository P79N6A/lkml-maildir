NFS can already be modular or monolithic, so I'm confused by the first
sentence.  Regardless, look at the file
[linux-src]/fs/super.c  
and search for mount (including sys_mount and do_mount), and get the source
for the user-land mount program for your distribution and check through
that.  
second, read RFC 1094 for NFSv2 and 1813 for NFSv3.  If you find these
online, I think they contain links to the RFC for the mount protocol.  
one slight annoyance i discovered for my project with doing the entire mount
phase in the kernel is performing name resolution --- although i haven't
asked here, i've yet to find a way to do 'gethostbyname' from the kernel
with fabricating my own udp packets.  if the mount command was literally
just a trigger for the kernel, this could be a problem.
