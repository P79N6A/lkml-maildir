I've got a better test case here. The following program triggers the same bug
(100% cpu, all "system"): (replace the for loop with a while(1) to see it
better):
----------------------------------------
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
char buf[4096];
int
main(void)
{
    int fd, rc, i;
    struct timeval tv;
    fd_set wset;
    fd = open("/dev/dsp", O_WRONLY);
    if (fd < 0) {
	printf("open failed\n");
	exit(0);
    }
    printf("opened\n");
    for (i=0; i < 10; i++) {
	printf("writing..\n");
	rc = write(fd, buf, 4096);
	printf(" rc=%d\n",rc);
	printf("selecting..\n");
	tv.tv_sec = 3; tv.tv_usec = 0;
	FD_ZERO(&wset);
	FD_SET(fd, &wset);
	rc = select(4, NULL, &wset, NULL, &tv);
	printf("select: %d\n", rc);
    }
    close(fd);
    exit(0);
}
----------------------------------------
If I turn on DEBUG in trident.c, then the 20ish audio syscalls made by that
program result in a few thousand lines of:
 Mar 26 22:14:51 luther kernel: trident: trident_get_dma_addr: chip reported channel: 63, cso = 0x1f74
 Mar 26 22:14:51 luther last message repeated 11 times
in my logs. That means that trident_update_ptr() is getting called repeatedly.
My suspicion is that somehow the select() is managing to make the write
process wake up too early. If I remove the select(), that code runs normally.
trident_poll() calls trident_update_ptr(), which (probably because it is
usually called from trident_interrupt()) wakes up &dmabuf->wait(), which would
wake up a writer that is sleeping until buffer space becomes available. I
can't see how that could really happen, though, because only one syscall
should be in progress at a time. The use of interruptible_sleep_on_timeout()
in trident_write() makes me a bit nervous, though, I'm wondering if there
could be a race between start_dac() and the sleep.
Anyway, that's about the extent of my debugging skills.. hope someone finds it
useful. Incidentally, kernel 2.3.42 exhibited the same behavior.
cheers,
