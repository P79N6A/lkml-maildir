I don't want to just hard-select it until I understand what happened
between 2.6.22.6 and current git to make ACPI selectable without PM.
Personally, I think ACPI should be independent of PM anyway (at least as
it is displayed and selectable in the user interface. Obviously there
may be functional relationships between them). There is a "C" in ACPI,
after all, and some of that "C" doesn't really have anything to do with
power management.
