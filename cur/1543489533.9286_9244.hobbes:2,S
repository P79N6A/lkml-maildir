Sorry, psaux port is not _mouse_ port. People commonly use it for
mouse, but what it is is strange ~9600 serial port at 5V. It does not
have to do anything with mice. You can plug keyboard in there (I did
it). Would you want your ttyS0 devices to disappear if modem is not
connected to them?

PS: Go for alan's suggestion: if (old_detection || new_detection)
assume_mouse_is_here(). I think we had some problems with old
detection also (it needed magic jumper to work ;-).
