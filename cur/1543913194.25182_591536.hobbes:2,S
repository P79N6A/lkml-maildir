That will not work, as I will have no means of releasing the BIOs of
the bidi request, which can not use end_request().
I guess as Jens said it's OK to remove them now, and later we can
just add end_that_request_first(), will be enough.
Or we can patch end_request() to also call 
__end_that_request_first(req->next_rq) if not NULL.
Jens which method do you prefer? I will adjust my patches accordingly.
Thanks
