Subject: [patch 0/6] PS3 Storage Drivers for 2.6.23, take 2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

	Hi,
This is the second submission of the new PS3 storage drivers:
  [1] ps3: Preallocate bootmem memory for the PS3 FLASH ROM storage driver
  [2] ps3: Storage Driver Core
  [3] ps3: Storage device registration routines.
  [4] ps3: Disk Storage Driver
  [5] ps3: ROM Storage Driver
  [6] ps3: FLASH ROM Storage Driver
They are based on the current Linux kernel source tree, plus the PS3 patches
already submitted by Geoff Levand on linuxppc-dev.
All issues raised during the previous review round should be fixed.
If there are no more comments, please apply for 2.6.23.  Since they depend on
other PS3 work, I think it's most logical to let Paul integrate them.
Thanks in advance!
With kind regards,
Geert Uytterhoeven
