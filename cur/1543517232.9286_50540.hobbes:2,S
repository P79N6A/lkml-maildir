Subject: 2.3.29 breaks ipfwadm/ipchains compatibility.

The removal of the `int dummy' to procfs's get_info function breaks
ipfwadm and ipchains compatibility modules (maintained outside the
official kernel), which use it to indicate `read-and-reset' when the
file is open read-write.
Don't blame me; it wasn't my hack.
Linus, will you accept a patch to pass the `struct file*' to get_info?
(which allows access to the file mode again), or revert the removal of
this final get_info arg?
Rusty.
PS.  No I don't want to put the backwards compatibility modules in the
	mainstream kernel; to provide masquerading they use all the
	new connection tracking and NAT code, and I don't want all that
	in the official kernel (not for 2.4 at least).
