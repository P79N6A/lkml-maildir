assert should definitely be more informative, and an assertion failure
is more than a debug statement.  The following functions more like the
userland version:
#ifndef NDEBUG
#  define kassert(cond) \
      if (!(cond)) {	\
      printk (KERN_ERR "kassert failed in function %s, file %s, line %d:
%s\n", \
		__FUNCTION__,		\
		__FILE__,		\
		__LINE__,		\
		__STRING(cond));	\
      *(int*)0 = 0; 			\
      }
#else
#  define kassert(cond)
#endif
You could put some additional switches in there to enable or disable the
oops after the printk, or to change KERN_ERR to something else.
