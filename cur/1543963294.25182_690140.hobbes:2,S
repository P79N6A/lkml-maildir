Hello,
The following set of patches remove demoboard-specific code from the
au1xmmc.c driver and add new features.
My main motivation was to let boards implement other carddetect schemes,
since on one of my boards the driver-implemented poll timer doesn't work
for some unknown reason.  But this board does have a dedicated carddetect
IRQ and card-present/card-readonly indicators which are incompatible with
the Db1200 implementation.  I also took the opportunity to clean up the
drivers probe() and irq() handlers to make it a "proper" platform device
(patches #3 and #4).
Patch #1 is required to get the driver to build as a module.
Patch #2 is required to be able to load/unload the driver > 16 times.
Patches #5 and #6 implement new features.
Patch #7 does a little codingstyle cleanup, no functional changes.
Change since V1:
- fix a bug in patch #6: SDIO irq should be checked for independently
  from other irq events.
- more trivial cleanups
Db1200 users, please test!  I verified the poll timer works on one of
older boards, however since I don't have Db1200 and Pb1200 boards I'm
not sure whether the driver still works with both SD controllers enabled!
Thanks!
