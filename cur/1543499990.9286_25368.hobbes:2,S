  Hi, all. A quick test compiling the 2.3.7 kernel tree shows 2.3.7
perform slightly worse than 2.3.5 for make dep. PII 233 with IDE disc.
2.3.7:
make clean
time make dep
21.870u 3.710s 0:51.19 49.9% 0+0k 0+0io 53292pf+0w
time make dep
21.950u 3.120s 0:26.90 93.1% 0+0k 0+0io 41875pf+0w
time make zImage
291.870u 17.570s 5:14.29 98.4% 0+0k 0+0io 192480pf+0w
2.3.5:
make clean
time make dep
22.100u 3.150s 0:50.46 50.0% 0+0k 0+0io 53395pf+0w
time make dep
22.240u 2.800s 0:25.90 96.6% 0+0k 0+0io 42128pf+0w
time make zImage
291.590u 18.810s 5:14.38 98.7% 0+0k 0+0io 194125pf+0w
The 2.3.5 test had the machine slightly more loaded than with 2.3.7
(minor work with remote emacs).
