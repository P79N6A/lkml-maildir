The description in kernel 2.6.11-rc3-mm1 make for the skge driver states 
the following:
"*New SysKonnect GigaEthernet support (EXPERIMENTAL) (SKGE)
This driver support the Marvell Yukon or SysKonnect SK-98xx/SK-95xx
and related Gigabit Ethernet adapters. It is a new smaller driver
driver with better performance and more complete ethtool support.
It does not support the link failover and network management
features that "portable" vendor supplied sk98lin driver does.* "
What makes my PCI Express mobo with on board 04:00.0 Ethernet 
controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Gigabit Ethernet Controller 
(rev 17)
*not *supported by skge driver is that it is a  NEW generation  driver  
Marvell Yukon  2.
I have SysKonnect's sk98lin driver working for me under a custom built 
2.6.9 kernel using SysKonnect's driver version 7.09 patched in the kernel.
The motherboard I'm using is a new Intel D915GEV. The specs on the lan 
show as:
Gigabit (10/100/1000 Mbits/sec) LAN subsystem using the Marvel* Yukon* 
88E8050 PCI Express* Gigabit Ethernet Controller.
Don't try this Stephen's skge driver with this, it isn't supported.
