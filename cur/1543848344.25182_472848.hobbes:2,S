Good news, as of kernel 2.6.19-rc1-git9, BIOS does *not* hang with both e1000 as
module or built in kernel.
The previous version of kernel was 2.6.18 which hangs the BIOS.
Aleksey:
are you sure that it is not the same in your case? Did you not switch kernel
version between e1000 as a module and built in kernel?
