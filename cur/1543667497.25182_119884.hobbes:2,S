Hi all,
Regarding RS485 communication I thank all of them for their responses. I finally decided to write a custom Layer 2 char driver or protocol to pave way for my IP over RS485 communication. I will like to get some inputs/docs/references on linux-ppp implementation. ISo am in the process of browsing the PPP code and exploring the interface it has with the serial driver which is crucial for me. Regarding this I request for more clarity on following: 
i) Linux PPP interface with IP: Registration, Packet send/receive/close
ii) Linux PPP interface with serial driver:Registration, Packet send/receive/close
iii) Linux PPP server configuration and initial sequence of working. i.e. associating a IP address with serial device and ppp0
I will be grateful if somebody could help me on this.
Thanks and Best Regards
Karthik
