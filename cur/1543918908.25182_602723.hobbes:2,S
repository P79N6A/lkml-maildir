Indeed, but that's the distribution I use and considered switching away

Nor want to understand, often.

As do I ofcourse. An operating system kernel development list might provide 
for a fairly non-average balanced population of "am / am not interested in 
the inner workings of computers". Given that most everyone these days uses a 
computer, it's still a really small percentage though -- and as evidenced by 
the bootsplash thing, even of Linux users (and I've in fact heard real-life 
people say they disliked the noisy Linux bootup due to "all those errors").

Oh quite. I use VGA console myself. But not being able to get to the bootup 
messages anymore even for people who do care is not the issue. It's about 
finding it a bit hard to get excited about colourization when the "obvious" 
way forward is so much more graphically oriented.
As also commented in another reply just now, ways forward also tend to have 
their problems but this kind of "innovation" takes me back to the time when 
our favorite bulletins board adopted ANSI colours. Today, that seems just a 
tad pathetic...
Again, it might not hurt any either, but sheesh.
Rene.
