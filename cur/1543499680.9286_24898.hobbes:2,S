No. 
Most kernel's sources are not compiled into "your" kernel: those are
drivers for hw you don't have. You really don't care that seagate.c
scsi driver is broken w.r.t. SMP, do you?
gcc is nightmare compared to kernel, because code is not reasonably
modular and all of it is used all the time. Gcc is subtle, inside. Ask
hubicka@atrey why it is nightmare (compared to l-k).
