   starting from -O3 gcc do always trys to do inlining.
   was observed on gcc 3.2 and I beleive I saw the same 2.95.3
   compile this test with 02 & 03:
-------------------
#include <stdio.h>
int aaa() { return 32; }
int main() {
         int b = aaa();
         printf("hello %d \n", b);
         return 0;
}
------------------
    and then objdump -d to see the difference between main()s: 02 - you 
will see function call, 03 - you will see just raw number 0x20 used.
