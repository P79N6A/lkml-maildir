Because NUMA_NO_NODE is 0xff on x86.  That's a valid node id for 
configurations with CONFIG_NODES_SHIFT equal to or greater than 8.

Wrong, this should be
	node == NUMA_NO_NODE

The net result of this is that if a proximity domain is looked up through 
acpi_map_pxm_to_node() and already has a mapping to node 255 (legal with 
CONFIG_NODES_SHIFT == 8), this function will return NID_INVAL since the 
weight of nodes_found_map is equal to MAX_NUMNODES.
You simply can't use valid node id's to signify invalid or unused node 
ids.

You mean
	node == NID_INVAL

That's the equivalent of your NUMA_NO_NODE code above.  The fact remains 
that (numanode_t)-1 is still a valid node id for MAX_NUMNODES >= 256.
So, as I said in my initial reply, the only way to get the savings you're 
looking for is to use u8 for CONFIG_NODES_SHIFT <= 7 and then convert all 
NID_INVAL users to use NUMA_NO_NODE.
Additionally, Linux has always discouraged typedefs when they do not 
define an architecture-specific size.  The savings from your patch for 
CONFIG_NODES_SHIFT == 7 would be 256 bytes for this mapping.
It's simply not worth it.

Section 6.2.9 of ACPI 2.0 states that PXM's return an integer, so that 
would be non-conforming to the standard.
Additionally, PXM's are not nodes, so casting them to anything called 
numanode_t shows the semantic flaw in your patch.
