OK, so a new call syntax would be desirable.  Or reserving page zero
even on such platforms.

I realize that, but it's still a grey area ... meaning only that the
specific choice, in a set of systems, is one of the design tradeoffs.
Costs can vary a lot, but near either end the tradeoffs get clearer.

And the reason that logic doesn't lead us to rip kmalloc() out of
the kernel (in favor of the page allocator) is ... what?  Every driver
shouldn't _need_ to write yet another malloc() clone, that's all I'm
saying; that'd be a waste.

I'll accept that for argument -- though I'll ask what other problems
(than this shared-cacheline scenario) you're thinking of.  This is the
only one that I recall seeming like it might argue for an API change.
(And USB is just one example, too.  Oliver turned up similar cases
in the SCSI layer, as I recall.  Likely a lot of it can be traced
down to widely-available hardware that wouldn't recognize a NUMA if
it tripped on one.)

Change, and fix up that lack of error codes on the mapping calls, and
maybe a few other things ... :)
Certainly hanging some sort of memory allocator object off struct device
should be pretty cheap.  At least for USB, all devices on the same bus
could share the same allocator.  Not that I know PCI that well, but I
suspect that could be true there too ... more sharing, less internal
fragmentation, and more efficient use of various resources.
