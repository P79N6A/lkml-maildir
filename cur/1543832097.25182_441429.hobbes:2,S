Hi all,
	I've handed over maintenance of module-init-tools to Jon Masters on
http://kerneltools.org
.  This is mainly because my time has been sucked
into other projects, and because it's now fairly easy for me to hand it
off to someone who'll be more active in applying patches (and maybe even
cleaning up some cruft!).
	Thanks to everyone who helped my "temporary" module utilities, and best
of luck to Jon...
Cheers!
Rusty.
