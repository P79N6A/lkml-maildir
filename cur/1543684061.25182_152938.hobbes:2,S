It's not working for me.  Client is 2.4.20 with nfsv3 enabled.  I enabled
nfsv3 but not nfsv4 on the server.  Client mounts, but when I attempte to
get a directory, the process on client goes D state.
Export on server was:
/ vegeta(rw,no_root_squash,async,nohide)
this name is resolvable on the server as 192.168.2.7
