Andrea, you really are a piece of work. Your arguments have been bogus 
crap that didn't even understand what was going on from the beginning, and 
now you continue to do that.
What exactly "takes away ram" from the VM?
The notion of adding a flag to "struct anon_vma"?
The one that already has a 4 byte padding thing on x86-64 just after the 
spinlock? And that on 32-bit x86 (with less than 256 CPU's) would have two 
bytes of padding if we didn't just make the spinlock type unconditionally 
32 bits rather than the 16 bits we actually _use_?
IOW, you didn't even look at it, did you?
But whatever. I clearly don't want a patch from you anyway, so ..
