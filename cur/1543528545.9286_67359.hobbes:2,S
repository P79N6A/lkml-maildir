I can't even guess what the ratio is on a small companys (like ours) file
server filled with old source versions and documents copies.

I second that. We do incremantal backups with
cp -al yesterdays-backup/ todays-backup/
rsync --archive --hard-links --whole-file --delete /backed-up-dir todays-backup
Of course, that works just fine (with very good disk space usage, since we
also use e2compr). But with cow-links, you could backup your working
(source, document, image) directory and not worry about disk space usage
or your editor creating new inode on save. 
On file servers there definetely are a lot of duplicates. Text documents,
source, images tend to be duplicated - people have their personal copies.
People hacking on source have multiple copies of it. 
You could have a cowlinkd running nightly on file server and finding and
cow-linking those duplicates. (It could e2compr less used files as well).
Of course, to get the most out of the redundancy in, say, document or
source tree, the cow-scheme would have to be on block level rather than
inode level (as it is page level in vm). I suppose that just wouldn't even
theoretically be affortable, since it would propably take per-block
reference counting.
