Sorry to be imprecise.  "Size of request" should be "size of response" 
or "cost of request".  The meaning is clear, I think.

Agreed that this is probably the least terrible of the available 
solutions, but in my specific case it requires a more extensive 
modification to my software than the relatively minor kernel change.

Regarding your straw man, nobody's proposing hundreds of mount options.  
I imagine the effort required to implement each one would keep such a 
thing from happening. ;-)

Fair enough.  A proc entry to alter this globally would be an acceptable 
compromise for me, even if my local sysadmins might not like it.
