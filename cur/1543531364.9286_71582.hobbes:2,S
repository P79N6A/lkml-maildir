It may not yet concern the core kernel group but 
perhaps it soon will if things go well...
I get a compile error from /drivers/block/loop_cast.c, 
part of the kerneli patches.
It doesn't like:
#if defined(__GNUC__) && (defined(i386) || defined(i486))
	__asm__ (
		"roll %%cl,%0"
		: "r" (data)
		: "0" (data), "c" (count)
		: "cx"
	);
             and so forth
where the error occurs on the cx register:
  fixed or forbidden register 2 (cx) was spilled for class CREG.
occurs many times before the kernel compiles bails out.
Is there any trivial fix?
The kernel is 2.2.14 with 2.2.14 international patches,
running on a Celeron processor. The dist doing the
kernel build is debian woody, current as of today.
