The firmware can be found here:

I must say that personally I've had this IBM DTLA drive for over 1.5 years 
now, and I haven't seen any problems with it whatsoever.
A friend of mine had the same problems (bad sectors), he reformatted the 
drive with the IBM drive tool and got rid of all bad sectors.
