Losing the directory isn't a big deal though.  And both unsharing a
namespace (which causes a ns_container_clone) and mounting the hierarchy
are done by userspace, so if for some installation it is a big deal,
the init scripts on initrd can mount the hierarchy before doing any
unsharing.
Can you think of a reason why losing a few directories matters?
