From past experience, some dead ATAPI devices stuck in DRQ=1. We should
take care of such situation, otherwise the HSM might get into an infinite
loop of waiting for the dead ATAPI device to say DRQ=0 and discarding
endless "trailing data".
Maybe we could set a limit here. If the ATAPI device keeps DRQ=1 and
exceeds the limit, we consider it as HSM violation and have EH handle it.
