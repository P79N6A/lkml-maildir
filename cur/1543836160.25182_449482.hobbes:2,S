I like it, but ...

Several files include asm/dma-mapping.h directly, which will now cause
them to fail to compile on x86-64 due to the missing definition for
valid_dma_direction, unless by chance another header already brought
it in indirectly. I guess the right thing to do is convert them all to
using linux/dma-mapping.h instead.
./arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-swiotlb.c:6:#include <asm/dma-mapping.h>
./drivers/net/fec_8xx/fec_main.c:40:#include <asm/dma-mapping.h>
./drivers/net/fs_enet/fs_enet.h:11:#include <asm/dma-mapping.h>
./include/asm-x86_64/swiotlb.h:5:#include <asm/dma-mapping.h>
./include/linux/dma-mapping.h:27:#include <asm/dma-mapping.h>
Cheers,
Muli
