Subject: [patch] posix compliance for send(to)

POSIX 1003.1-2001, 2003 edition
(see 
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/toc.htm
)
says about send():
  The send() function shall send a message only
  when the socket is connected
and gives the error returns
[ENOTCONN]
  The socket is not connected or otherwise has not had the peer
  pre-specified.
[EPIPE]
  The socket is shut down for writing, or the socket is connection-mode
  and is no longer connected. In the latter case, and if the socket is of
  type SOCK_STREAM, the SIGPIPE signal is generated to the calling thread.
However, currently (2.6.0-test6) I see EPIPE and SIGPIPE
for a send() on a fresh, non-connected socket.
I suppose the below patch fixes this, but have not checked
details of the state machine.
