what is the worst latency you can trigger with Florian's latest
rtc_wakeup code? (please re-download it, there has been a recent update)
also, there are no "arbitrary load" latency guarantees with
DEADLOCK_DETECTION turned on, since we search the list of all held locks
during task-exit time - this can generate pretty bad latencies e.g.
during hackbench.
