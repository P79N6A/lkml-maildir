Perhaps yes.
But at least now, that kind of translation still sucks. It can
satisfy me.

I never say to translate C comments. What we want to translate is the
strings in Kconfig.
I abosutely agree that we should focus on the exsiting bugs of Linux,
but like Greg's inclusion of some kernel doc translations, this kind
of work is really helpful to attract some kernel newbies from none
English-speaking countries. Even we can't make offical efforts,
the civil work, like TLKTP, is still worthy. Believe me, I am leading
a local LUG in my college and I found that one _big_ reason that why
the newbies are afraid of Linux kernel is English, instead of the
C tricks or low-level programming.
