Dave,
I'd like to apologise in advance if I seem too pushy, and I know you all 
have more than enough to do:
But this seems to be a pretty big thing to leave out of the production 
Kernel. Unless Red Hat and other distros are planning to use 2.6 in 
their next release, there are a lot of these KT400 MBs out there. My 
local computer reseller was selling 10 to 20 of these boards for every 
one of any other AMD chipset right up until VIA released the KT600.
I am actually using the KT-400-A variant of this board, which has no 
option to use anything but agp 3.0 even with a 4X card. (straight from 
the mouths of Giga-byte tech support)
Yes, I could use 2.6-x and help test that, but like so many people, I 
need to have something reliable so I can get some work done.
If I knew anything at all about writing code, I would be more than happy 
to help, but since I don't, I'd like to offer my time to help test any 
patches or backports someone could come up with.
Thanks,
