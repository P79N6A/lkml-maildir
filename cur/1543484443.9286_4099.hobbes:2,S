Hi all,
	Thx for the pointer, but I have bad news.  After going over the
code I remembered why this was never added to the std. kernel a loong time
ago when proposed.  Many of the options made some older boards unstable. 
The issues are the same as when it was suggested to make the
suspend_on_halt of the Cx686 default to on.  IMHO, this will have to stay
as a module or (preferably) a user space utility.  Only workaround would
be to generate a white-list of boards where the optimizations are safe,
but these are old boards and hard to identify.
	Cheers,
		Rafael
