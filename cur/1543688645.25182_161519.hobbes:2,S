Well, I have a 500 Mhz PIII and 192 MB of RAM. However, I never ever
get skips with stock 2.4 or with O11int. 
Also, I noticed today that while the system was under moderate load
(~100 procmail/sendmail pairs filtering mail through spamassassin +
Firebird + xmms), starting an app like emacs took ages. I had to wait
and wait and finally only when I tried to open a second instance did
the first one come up. That did not happen before..
