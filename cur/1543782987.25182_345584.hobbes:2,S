Linus,
I think I remember reading one time that you have permissions on the 
snapshots/ dir on kernel.org? Any chance all the pre-2.6.13 stuff can be 
pushed to the old/ dir?
Also, 2.6.13-git1 didn't get generated right (it's empty!) but the log is 
fine (300k worth). Hopefully someone can fix this too?
thanks,
-cp
