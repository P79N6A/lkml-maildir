1) Tried "make clean"
In the end it gave the following result:
make -C arch/i386/lib clean
Cleaning up
/home/sam/src/linux/kernel/bk/local/Rules.make:134: warning: overriding commands for target `clean'
Makefile:168: warning: ignoring old commands for target `clean'
make clean is too verbose now, especially taken KBUILD_VERBOSE= in consideration.
2) While doing a clean build I spotted:
  LD     drivers/char/pcmcia/built-in.o
  LD     drivers/char/built-in.o
rm defkeymap.c
  CC     drivers/ide/device.o
  CC     drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.o
This rm looks wrong to me.
Btw. I did not use -j and on UP.
Second make did the following:
  CP     drivers/char/defkeymap.c
  CC     drivers/char/defkeymap.o
  LD     drivers/char/built-in.o
  LD     drivers/built-in.o
  Generating build number
  ...
Third make completed with success.
3) ChangeSet@1.490.1.62
Within Rules.make in section "Commands useful for boot image"
In the lines
#	target: source(s) FORCE
-#		$(if_changed,ld/objcopy)
+#              $(if_changed,ld/objcopy/gzip)
4)  Clean up arch/i386
I miss $(obj) in front of tools/build
zImage: bootsect setup vmlinux.bin tools/build
-	tools/build bootsect setup vmlinux.bin $(ROOT_DEV) > $@
+	$(obj)/tools/build bootsect setup vmlinux.bin $(ROOT_DEV) > $@
bzImage: bbootsect bsetup bvmlinux.bin tools/build

Reading through the 4 patches I miss $(obj) in many places.
In generally all temporary and final target needs $(obj)
5) jobserver unavailable
I've started too see this when I execute "make -j2":
make[1]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.
Dunno if this is my local setup??
It happens even with nothing to do, e.g. a second make without changes in-between.
make -v:
GNU Make version 3.79.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.
