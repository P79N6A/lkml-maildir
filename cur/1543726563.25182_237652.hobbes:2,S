I don't think anyone wants an x86 emulator builtin to the kernel for this 
purpose.

We can get away without caching a copy of the ROM in the kernel if we require 
userspace to cache it before the driver takes control of the card (i.e. at 
POST time).  Otherwise, the kernel will have to take care of it.
