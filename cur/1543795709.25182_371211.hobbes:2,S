Regarding NUD_REACHABLE <-> NUD_STALE transition it has a timer check.
Due to the fast path it's not enabled per default. Use neigh_sync() to
check, although I believe the installed tasklet does this for you already.
The knowledgeable netdev people will know better.

How do you use VMACs in 2.4.x?

If this is really a problem, why not simply call neigh_sync()? Your
patch also seems to be whitespace damaged.

I've cc'd netdev since this is where such patches should go for
discussion; left Linus in the loop (netiquette) although he's nothing to
do with this ;).
