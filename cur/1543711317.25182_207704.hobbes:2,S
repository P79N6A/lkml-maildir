I would be assuming that by "generic" we meant arrays of unsigned longs
(or one unsigned long or something isomorphic to one or more unsigned
longs ...).
And I'm assuming that we mean of a size that would allow for putting a
couple of them on a kernel stack ... not _too_ big. Probably NR_CPUS
rough upper limit on the size that was practical to use.
I wouldn't want to get _too_ generic.

Thanks.
