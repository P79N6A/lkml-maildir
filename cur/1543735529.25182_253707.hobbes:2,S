I believe there are none.  BTW, the iomap discussion didn't happen
on linux-arch.  Linus posted saying "hey, I've added __iomem markers
for sparse's benefit; isn't this cool?" and there was some discussion
around that, but nothing about the iomap() interface.

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
