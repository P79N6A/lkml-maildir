Subject: USB Mouse oddity with 2.6.0-test2-mm4 + 013int

I just went to 2.6.0-test2-mm4 with Con's 012/013 interactivity patches 
(from 2.6.0-test2-mm2) on my laptop and I'm now having an odd time with 
my USB mouse.  After a short period of time (5 minutes or less), it 
stops working entirely.  If I remove the usbmouse module and reload it, 
I get it back.  There is nothing in my logs or dmesg output stating any 
kind of problem.  Is anyone else seeing this problem?  Anyone happen to 
know where the problem may lie?
