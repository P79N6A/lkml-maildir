The problem is caused by an SMI during the calibration routine. We
really need to come up with a solid solution which does not rely on
the periodic timer coming in, when there is something else (HPET,
pm_timer) available.
I have a look into this.
Arun, do you have an USB keyboard plugged in ? If not, can you connect
one and check, whether it changes things or not ?
Thanks,
