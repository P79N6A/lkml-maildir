The page table allocator is heavier weight than the quicklists,
although obviously not as heavy weight as SLAB.
I know special purpose allocation lists suck, but they really help in
this case in my opinion.
And for the x86 cases it's not going to help to have GFP_ZERO stuff
via the page allocator for page tables, they have to have specific
bits in the pre-initialized areas for the kernel PGDs, not just zero.
