Hi Ingo & Eric.
The purpose was to define common stuff in a single place.
Ask Rusty Russell if it is fun to add the same section to > 50
.lds files.
Based on the feedback I will try to come up with a lighter proposal,
that does not hurt readability.
I still want the common stuff separated away.
And I will in the process try to add a bit more descriptive comments,
I agree the linker scripts are hard to read today. It would help if people
cared to spend a few more lines explaning the actual usage.
Having such explanation in a common place would make the chances for
an update of the comments bigger.
