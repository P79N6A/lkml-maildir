Sorry, I don't think patch 1 by itself is functionally correct.  It opens
a can of worms with race window all over the place.  It does more damage
than what it is trying to solve.  Here is one case:
1 thread fault on hugetlb page, allocate a non-zero page, insert into the
page cache, then proceed to zero it.  While in the middle of the zeroing,
2nd thread comes along fault on the same hugetlb page.  It find it in the
page cache, went ahead install a pte and return to the user.  User code
modify some parts of the hugetlb page while the 1st thread is still
zeroing.  A potential silent data corruption.
The scenario could be even worst that after 1st thread finish zeroing, find
a pte in the page table is already instantiated and then it proceed to back
out that newly allocated hugetlb page.
What is needed here is the code that does find-alloc-insert should be one
atomic step under corner cases.  I was thinking using a semaphore to
protect the code sequence. But I haven't come up with a reasonable
solution yet.
