Comments and testing results:
- Measured a 2 millisec hit in lat_tcp and 4 millisec in bw_tcp. 
  This was in tasklet context :(
- The 5 millisec pc_keyb X startup thing is still there.  My vote is
  to leave it alone.
- You need to add a reschedule in ipc/shm.c:shm_free().  Quintela's
  shm-stress will show why.
- mmap002 is killed by the VM when running `amlat' at 1024 Hz to
  create scheduling pressure.
  This is changed behaviour: it does not happen without this patch.
- In swap_out_mm() it is not correct to restart the vma scan after
  scheduling.  If the current vma will take over a millisec to scan,
  and there is a process being scheduled once per millisec, swap_out_mm
  will never terminate.  This is fairly easy to demonstrate with
  mmap002.
  The fix is to resume the scan from `vma->vm_start'.
- mmap002 sometimes hangs when run under scheduling pressure. 
  Probably due to the above problem.
- Running Quintela's ipc001 and then running mmap002 causes 8
  millisec scheduling holes.
- `lilo' hangs when run under scheduling pressure if there are a lot
  of dirty blocks on the device.  fsync_dev() changes.
- If you run bonnie++ to create lots of slab cache entries and then
  run mmap002, the resulting call to kmem_cache_reap() causes basically
  unbounded scheduling delays.  I observed ~6 millisecs.  I didn't fix
  this either.
- The patch significantly worsens bonnie++ figures.  The overall
  execution time went from 9:04 to 9:23 when run during 1024 Hz
  scheduling pressure.  From 8:44 to 8:52 when run without
  scheduling pressure.
