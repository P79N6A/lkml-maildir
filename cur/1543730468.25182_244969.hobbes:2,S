You are right, I'll do that.
Which brings me to another thing regarding configs and defaults - there 
does not seem to be much relation between the defaults in the various 
Kconfig files and the settings in arch/<foo>/defconfig which puzzles me, 
especially since "make defconfig" seems to use the stuff from 
arch/<foo>/defconfig and not what's specified in Kconfig...
Wouldn't it make sense to update the defconfig's to match the Kconfig's 
when I make these changes?
