Don't change for how long?  As I said, old versions never were
available "forever" on kernel.org -- usually they only stayed a 
few months, though lately the lifetime stretched out a little.
I don't really want to, for example, copy the tarball to 
two places each time.  That takes me extra time, and is prone
to errors (e.g., I might forget).
Cheers,
Michael
