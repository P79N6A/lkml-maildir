Kernel compilation
==================
GCC
---
The gcc version requirements may vary depending on the type of CPU in your
computer. The next paragraph applies to users of x86 CPUs, but not
necessarily to users of other CPUs. Users of other CPUs should obtain
information about their gcc version requirements from another source.
The recommended compiler for the kernel is gcc 2.95.x (x >= 3), and it
should be used when you need absolute stability. You may use gcc 3.0.x
instead if you wish, although it may cause problems. Later versions of gcc
have not received much testing for Linux kernel compilation, and there are
almost certainly bugs (mainly, but not exclusively, in the kernel) that
will need to be fixed in order to use these compilers. In any case, using
pgcc instead of plain gcc is just asking for trouble.
The Red Hat gcc 2.96 compiler subtree can also be used to build this tree.
You should ensure you use gcc-2.96-74 or later. gcc-2.96-54 will not build
the kernel correctly.
In addition, please pay attention to compiler optimization.  Anything
greater than -O2 may not be wise.  Similarly, if you choose to use gcc-2.95.x
or derivatives, be sure not to use -fstrict-aliasing (which, depending on
your version of gcc 2.95.x, may necessitate using -fno-strict-aliasing).

The BLKBSZGET macro is defined in the kernel in include/linux/fs.h :
   fs/compat_ioctl.c:1879:#define BLKBSZGET_32   _IOR(0x12,112,int)
The _IOR macro is defined in include/asm-<arch>/ioctl.h
   include/asm-i386/ioctl.h:64:#define _IOR(type,nr,size) 
_IOC(_IOC_READ,(type),(nr),(_IOC_TYPECHECK(size)))
_IOC, _IOC_READ and _IOC_TYPECHECK are defined in include/asm-<arch>/ioctl.h
May I recommend to you the excellent tool `grep` as well at the Linux
