Wrong as in "don't export the variable, the function, and on top of
that, not document what you are trying to do."

But you never sent it to the i2c maintainers, right?
I understand what you are trying to accomplish with this type of patch,
but if you _really_ need to make this kind of change, please change the
name to something that really stands out as being not the thing you ever

Something like:
	i2c_we_just_paniced_and_can_not_sleep_anymore()
thanks,
