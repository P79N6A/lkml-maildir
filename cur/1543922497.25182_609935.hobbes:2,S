Subject: [PATCH 31/31] IGET: Remove iget() and the read_inode() super op as being obsolete [try #5]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/25/263

Remove the old iget() call and the read_inode() superblock operation it uses
as these are really obsolete, and the use of read_inode() does not produce
proper error handling (no distinction between ENOMEM and EIO when marking
an inode bad).
Furthermore, this removes the temptation to use iget() to find an inode by
number in a filesystem from code outside that filesystem.
iget_locked() should be used instead.  A new function is added in an earlier
patch (iget_failed) that is to be called to mark an inode as bad, unlock it and
release it should the get routine fail.
Mark iget() and read_inode() as being obsolete and remove references to them
from the documentation.
Typically a filesystem will be modified such that the read_inode function
becomes an internal iget function, for example the following:
	void thingyfs_read_inode(struct inode *inode)
	{
		...
	}
would be changed into something like:
	struct inode *thingyfs_iget(struct super_block *sp, unsigned long ino)
	{
		struct inode *inode;
		int ret;
		
		inode = iget_locked(sb, ino);
		if (!inode)
			return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);
		if (!(inode->i_state & I_NEW))
			return inode;
		...
		unlock_new_inode(inode);
		return inode;
	error:
		iget_failed(inode);
		return ERR_PTR(ret);
	}
and then thingyfs_iget() would be called rather than iget(), for example:
	ret = -EINVAL;
	inode = iget(sb, ino);
	if (!inode || is_bad_inode(inode))
		goto error;
becomes:
	inode = thingyfs_iget(sb, ino);
	if (IS_ERR(inode)) {
		ret = PTR_ERR(inode);
		goto error;
	}
Note that is_bad_inode() does not need to be called.  The error returned by
thingyfs_iget() should render it unnecessary.
