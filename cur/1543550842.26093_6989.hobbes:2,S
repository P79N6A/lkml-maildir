   tty_register_devfs and tty_unregister_devfs both declare "struct tty_struct" locals.
   According to gdb:
   (gdb) p sizeof(struct tty_struct)
   $20 = 3084
   This eats up most of a 4K page, and on UML this is causing the stack to flow off the page for some people.
   Is it possible to make that tty_struct static or kmalloc it or
   something?
And it's allocating a tty_struct for a really dumb reason, too.  It's
just using it so it cna call tty_name.
Just replace the call to tty_name with something like this:
	sprintf(buf, driver->name, idx + driver->name_base)
and make the obvious change to avoid using tty.device, and you can avoid
need to allocate a tty_struct altogether.
