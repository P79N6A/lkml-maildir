This is short series for fuse writable mmap support.
The first two patches are small additions to mm infrastructure.  The
third is a large patch for fuse.  It also depends on the "mm: bdi:
export BDI attributes in sysfs" series.
I don't mind if this goes into 2.6.25 (guess, that depends on whether
the bdi things go).
Thanks,
Miklos
