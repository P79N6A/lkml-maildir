I see two problems with that. But let me first describe the current 
/proc/user_beancounters.  This is how it looks like from inside a container:
# cat /proc/user_beancounters
Version: 2.5
       uid  resource           held    maxheld    barrier      limit    failcnt
       123: kmemsize         836919    1005343    2752512    2936012          0
            lockedpages           0          0         32         32          0
            privvmpages        4587       7289      49152      53575          0
............(more lines like that).........................................
I.e. a container owner can take a glance over the current parameters, 
their usage and (the thing that is really important) fail counters. Fail 
counter increases each time a parameter hits the limit. This is very 
straightforward way for container's owner to see if everything is OK or not.
So, the problems with /sys are:
(1) Gettng such info from 40+ files requires at least some script, while 
now cat is just fine.
(2) Do we want to virtualize sysfs and enable /sys for every container? 
Note that user_beancounters statistics is really needed for container's 
owner to see. At the same time, container's owner should not be able to 
modify it -- so we should end up with read/write ubc entries for the 
host system and read-only ones for the container.
Taking into account those two issues, current /proc/user_beancounters 
might be not that bad.
