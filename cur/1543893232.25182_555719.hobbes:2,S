I agree that stepping back and asking questions is the right thing
to do here.
/proc also reports lots of kernel internals, yet it is required
to maintain compatibility.
ISTM that sysfs should allow additions, but only in ways that don't
break backwards compatibility.  I.e., it should maintain backwards
compatible interfaces when new ones are added.  Yeah, that means
leave some crud around.  Yes, it may be as bad as /proc, but I've
said that for quite awhile.
