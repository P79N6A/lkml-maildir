    I have basic USB serial-I/O support built-in to my kernel:
it needs to monitor a USB-based UPS.  Would a keyboard/mouse
require more support than to simply be compiled in?
    I had a laptop that only had a 10Mb-ethernet built-in. 
When it became a few years old, I switched to using a PCMCIA
card for 100Mb-ethernet.  I never used the laptop's internal
port anymore but always used the pluggable card.  PCMCIA was
still outside the kernel then, so my quick & easy solution was
to not compile in the 10BT device and use the in-kernel driver
for the 3com based 100BT card.  I didn't need the "hot plugging"
capabilities of PCMCIA -- the kernel just called the new device
"eth0", and used it as a "permanent device".
    If a computer uses USB I/O for basic console operations,
can't those drivers be statically built-in?
