8 Mb or 8 MB?  Big difference...
So you have 512K worth of compressed code, most of which is running the
configuration menus and code to do initialization and setup of the
runtime environment (build tables, and so on.)  That's not really BIOS,
per se, in the sense of an interface; any firmware has to do that stuff
no matter what.
