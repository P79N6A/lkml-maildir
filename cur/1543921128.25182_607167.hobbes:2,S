Oh, OK. Bit risky ;) You might be right, but anyway I think it
should be just as fast with the optimised bit_unlock on most
architectures.
Which reminds me, it would be interesting to test the ia64
implementation I did. For the non-atomic unlock, I'm actually
doing an atomic operation there so that it can use the release
barrier rather than the mf. Maybe it's faster the other way around
though? Will be useful to test with something that isn't a trivial
loop, so the slub case would be a good benchmark.
