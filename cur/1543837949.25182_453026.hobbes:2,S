I'm told now that it uses Jiffies for TCP timestamps.  I've had thoughts
on this:
 - I figured a random timestamp with random microsecond skew would be
nice but this might expose internals of the RNG; amusingly I'm trying
not to expose internals of the RNG by exposing system time.
 - Someone recommended starting at zero.  This would work, really,
there's no attacks based on guessing the TCP timestamp value.  This is
nice since if I want to hax0rz then I might make a connection and see
how many jiffies there are to get a feel for the system's uptime; this
tells me how long since you upgraded your kernel, so I have an arsenal
of vulns I KNOW you haven't fixed ready ;)  Starting at 0 doesn't give
that information.
Comments?
