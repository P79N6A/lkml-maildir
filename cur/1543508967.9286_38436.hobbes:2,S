The existing RAID code does not support hot swapping, IIRC.  This means
that, if you had a hardware problem which RAID is supposed to correct,
you have to take the machine down in order to replace the failed disk. 
It is a valid argument, IMHO, that the existing RAID code should not
even be considered "production."  So, upgrading the code "for
nothing" is a misnomer.  Since no sane administrator would use RAID in a
production environment without upgrading it I don't see the logic in
holding back the patches.
I >THOUGH< that was one of the so-called benefits of Linux -- that you
don't have to wait a long time for some monolithic company or
organization to make new features and bug fixes available to you. 
Failure to upgrade a more-heavily-tested and "stable" RAID base in the
2.2 kernel directly contradicts this belief.
Needless to say, I'm not a happy camper.  I guess I won't be until
almost a year past when 2.2 came out when the new RAID code is
integrated into the kernel (my prediction, hopefully too pessimistic). 
Unfortunately there's not a whole lot about it that I can do as it
seems Alan, Linus, and Ingo all agree that it's not going into 2.2...
