anyone having problems with the quota command not working for nfs mounted
volumes with 2.2?
linux 2.2]quota
quota's for user blah: none
linux 2.0]quota
(works fine)
where both systems have the same /home mounted. rpc.rquotad on the server is
obviously working fine. a strace of quota shows it trying to open a
"0.0.0.0" socket.
is there an updated quota for 2.2?
thanks,
Paul Jakma.
