I was thinking that if the module was compiled for 64bit then the 64bit 
definition would prevail and visa versa.
eg. In the include file.
#ifdef COMPAT_IOCTL
#define AUTOFS_IOC_SETTIMEOUT(..., unsigned int)
#else
#define AUTOFS_IOC_SETTIMEOUT(...,unsigned long)
#endif
I think I'm going to have to investigate further following the 
implementation.

Of course a sensible approach.

Yep. I'll check and amend it later.
After all it will be part of the module then.
Thanks
