Thanks for this patch. But why hasn't it been included into
the kernel earlier? Wouldn't be a combination of yours and my
patch be the proper way? As far as I understand you switch
off automatic buffer flushing completely, but it should be done
every interval of time the administrator want's it. Why do
you think that raising the upper limits of the kernel variables
is not suitable?
