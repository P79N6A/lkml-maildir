The original poster reported on 2.4.20-rc2 (which reports 0K), not 2.4.18. 
The output I provided was from .18 and that clearly says 'L1 I cache:12K'.
Here are some 'sniplets' of my 2.4.18 dmesg :
Linux version 2.4.18-sca8smp (root@r2) (gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.3 2.96-112)) #1 SMP Wed Nov 6 20:17:23 CET 2002
[snip]

Ok, since this is now fixed (with your patch), I really don't care about 
earlier kernels anyway (however some of my customer might have if it was 
an issue). Do you know if your patch is going into 2.4.20 release (it's a 
rather small and useful patch) ?
Thanks,
