Hi,
I have to know when a specific computer goes online. Unfortunately, sending
a mail is not quick enough (takes >10min, due to firewall restrictions),
and so cannot be used.
As far as I understand, I can make the computer e.g. send a specific UDP
packet to my computer (which would surpass firewalls and such) and make my
computer beep or something if it recognizes the packet. This should be fast
enough... I don't have any idea where to start programming this in C,
however.
Could you point me to the respective manual pages or has anyone been doing
this sort of thing already?
