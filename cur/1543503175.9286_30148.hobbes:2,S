I am trying to locate an email address for either of the two
authors of the BSD games packages, primarily the cribbage game.
No email address is given in the source code, and I'm wanting to

So, Ken or Eric, if you are reading this, or if anyone knows an
email address of either of these individuals, please email me at:
mharris@meteng.on.ca
Here is the info I have to go on:
