Well there are lots of current and potential future users of this
function, many of them down at the end of long call chains. So I'm more
worried about the new cases that embrace this approach and suddenly add
300 bytes of stack. In fact, if this is at all popular, we can expect to
have more than one of these frames on the stack in various paths. 
Given that it only exists to make output prettier, it doesn't -really-
justify increased stack usage.

Adding a gfp_flags arg isn't too painful. And we've generally avoided
having separate function calls for atomic vs non-atomic allocation.
Btw, we can also easily hide Willy or Rusty's stringbuf implementation
under the covers here and still have a scheme that automatically falls
back to direct printk..
