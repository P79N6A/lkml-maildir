Hi.
To get my asus m2v onboard controllers to work, i added the following 
lines (tested with 2.6.16.X kernels, but the device-ids are not included 
in the actual 2.6.17.X, too):
in
drivers/scsi/sata_via.c
to
static const struct pci_device_id svia_pci_tbl[]
{ 0x1106, 0x0591, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, vt6420 },
and in
drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c
to
via_isa_bridges[]
{ "unknown",     PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C586_1,     0x00, 0x07, 
VIA_UDMA_133 | VIA_BAD_AST },
After this changes everything is working absolutely fine.
I hope I could help and have sent this bug report to the right place.
Regards,
Joachim Schlichting
