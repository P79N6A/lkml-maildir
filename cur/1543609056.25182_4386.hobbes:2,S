Hello,
the SIGXFSZ signal is produced in the file mm/filemap.c (linx-2.4.14) in
line 2771:
2769:	if (limit != RLIM_INFINITY) {
2770:		if (pos >= limit) {
2771:			send_sig(SIGXFSZ, current, 0);
2772:			goto out;
2773:		}
The valus at this point are
limit:         0x7fffffff
RLIM_INFINITY: 0xffffffff
pos:           0x80004000
where limit comes from:
unsigned long	limit = current->rlim[RLIMIT_FSIZE].rlim_cur;
but I did not yet detected the point(s) where
current->rlim[RLIMIT_FSIZE].rlim_cur
is(are) set/changed.
