I've just updated the bug.

The answer to this and your other issues you raise about the driver are
the same.  I do not want to fork the driver.  I still have to maintain
support all the way back to 2.4.7 and branching the driver for every
different supported kernel would be a nightmare to maintain.  As it stands
now, other than the Makefile and kernel config files, there is just one
set of files that supports all of these kernels.  It makes it much
easier for everyone involved including the primary maintainer of the
driver.
Personally, I don't see how this:
AIC_LINUX_IRQRETURN_T
ahd_linux_isr(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs * regs)
{
        struct  ahd_softc *ahd;
        u_long  flags;
        int     ours;
...
        AIC_LINUX_IRQRETURN(ours);
}
Is any harder to parse than:
irqreturn_t
ahd_linux_isr(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs * regs)
{
        struct  ahd_softc *ahd;
        u_long  flags;
        int     ours;
...
        return IRQ_RETVAL(ours);
}
I've tried hard to make most of the API differences similarly transparent
within the driver to avoid messy ifdefs.  I haven't succeeded everywhere,
but this is the price you pay when APIs change so often.  All of the code
is also setup so that the backwards compatibility hooks have no impact on
the driver's performance under any support kernel (i.e. each kernel is
supported as best as it can be supported).
Is there some new policy against having drivers that support multiple
kernel versions?
