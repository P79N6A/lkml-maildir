 I don't think so.  As far as I understand the I/O APIC operation, you
can't really know the state of an interrupt input when Remote IRR is set
(i.e. an interrupt from the input is being processed).  You can only read
a sort of state of an input from the Delivery Status bit when Remote IRR
is cleared.
 For the i82489DX you could have read the state of an individual interrupt
request from the IRR register of the local unit handling the IRQ.
