   Another case, where I really don't like the way Linux relies on big kernel
   lock is registering/unregistering filesystems. Currently it is only done
   either in initialization context or from module_init/cleanup which means
   we either don't need a lock or have a big kernel lock respectively. I
   would have preferred to see file_systems protected by a read-write lock
   whereby register/unregister take a write and all others take a read. When
   I wanted to do it I hit the obstacle - the way mount_root() walks through
   it sleeping on the way (in read_super())...
Umm... it's not like registering/unregistering filesystems is a very
common activity.  If we need to take the Big Lock while we register a
filesystem, it's hardly going to hurt anyone.  It's not like this is
done thousands of times a second.  :-)
