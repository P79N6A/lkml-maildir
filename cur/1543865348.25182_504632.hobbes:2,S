Subject: [patch 11/59] [stable] [PATCH] IB/mthca: Fix off-by-one in FMR handling on memfree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Michael S. Tsirkin <mst@mellanox.co.il>
mthca_table_find() will return the wrong address when the table entry
being searched for is exactly at the beginning of a sglist entry
(other than the first), because it uses >= when it should use >.
Example: assume we have 2 entries in scatterlist, 4K each, offset is
4K.  The current code will return first entry + 4K when we really want
the second entry.
In particular this means mapping an FMR on a memfree HCA may end up
writing the page table into the wrong place, leading to memory
corruption and also causing the HCA to use an incorrect address
translation table.

This is upstream, and fixes a data corruption/crash bug with storage
over SRP.
