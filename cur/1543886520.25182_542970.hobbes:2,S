You're assuming two things:
1. The bus the host controller reside on is synchronous both in adding devices
and drivers. This is true for most buses, but not all. As we can see, the MMC
bus is an example of one that isn't.
2. The bus the host controller reside on is scanned before any sync function we add.
The second probably isn't much of a stretch, but the first is more likely to
break. E.g. an usb based controller would not satisfy 1 as usb is scanned
asynchronously. Platform devices are case by case (e.g. some device might be
delayed since it needs time to power up).

It isn't. The MMC bus is a pesky bugger in that it is slow and involves a lot of
sleeping and asynchronous callbacks. As such, synchronisation needs to be very
explicit using for example completions.

Probably. But I'd like to hope we're gaining more than we lose. There are some
horror stories from the scsi camp where synchronous scanning means it takes an
hour to boot a machine.

I'm not familiar with that code, but I would guess it has a whole bunch of
prerequisite conditions. And the nfs root installations I've seen all use
initrd, so I would assume there are some restrictions to letting the kernel
handle it.

I think most people can live with having an initrd, so I wouldn't paint quite
such a bleak picture.

Monitor /proc/partitions or /sys until the device you need for rootfs shows up.
The big problem from my point of view is that I do not want to start promising
people a feature we might not be able to support in the future, and perhaps not
even now with some hardware.
Is there some reason you cannot use an initrd or is it just the inconvenience?
