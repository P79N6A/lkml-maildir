I had the same problem.  Someone here pointed out the fix.  It has to do
with the /etc/nsswitch.conf file, which in Redhat 5.1 and 5.2 assumes you
are using NIS.  If you're not using NIS, it will cause these hangs.  Edit
/etc/nsswitch.conf and remove all references to nis and the problem
magically disappears.
