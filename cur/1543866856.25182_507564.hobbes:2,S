I'm using M$ hibernation and Suspend2 to dual boot on our desktop (dtv
card that Linux doesn't support well yet), and I know other Suspend2
users doing the same. It's made earier by the fact that Suspend2 lets
you reboot instead of powering down.
As to comparing the speed with the time to boot, your estimates are way
out. Both will of course vary with the harddrive and cpu speeds and
compression qualities of the image, but with Suspend2, I'm seeing speeds
more in the range of 40-100MB/s, and even had a resport of 160MB/s a
couple of days ago. The rule of thumb I use is:
Run hdparm -t (or equiv) on the drive you'll be using:
nigel@nigel:~$ sudo hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  120 MB in  3.02 seconds =  39.70 MB/sec
Then calculate RAM_IN_MB / 2 / HDPARM_RESULT = seconds to read/write
image.
In my case: 1024 / 2 / 39.7 = approx 12 seconds. The / 2 is because with
LZF compression, you normally get about 50% compression.
I think the mean reason some people aren't interested in suspend to disk
is because of myths (if you'll excuse the term) like the one you've put
above. Of course that values you give were more accurate for swsusp and
uswsusp until recently, but Suspend2 has had async I/O and compression
for years, so all I can really do is encourage you to try again.
Of course there's another factor you're not taking into account: With
suspending to disk, you don't have to close and reopen documents or shut
down and restart applications. The time to do that should be factored
into the non-suspend-to-disk time to compare apples with apples.
