	this system is is able to build "partitions" of ressources 
	(processors, memory, I/O-channels).
	using these you are able to boot multiple operating systems at the
same time with
	dynamically ressource-management (during runtime, you can move a
processor 
	from one to another partition, if both the operating system support
the dynamic
	ressource allocation). so even if you can support only 4 or 8
processors it's still
	very usefull (imagine 4 LINUXes as a high availability solution in
one box,
	beeing able to communicate via a shared memory area...)
	what about multiple kernels? I think not long ago I read something
about this here...
	on the other hand, they had to change something in Win2K, NetWare
and 
	UnixWare in order to run on this box - so it should be possible for
LINUX as well.
	unfortunately the guys at UNISYS have a very close "strategic" 
	connection to M$ ;-(
	what they do with this machine is what they call "cellular multi
processing".
	every "cell" is running smp with up to four processors and they
connect them
	via a "crossbar". there might be something necessary to adjust in
the OS...
	interresting: in one cell the processors have to match, but in
different cells
	there can be different types (e.g. IA32 / IA64, even unisys 
	proprietary "CMOS" processor).
