Ahh, so NUMAQ and VISWS don't seem to allow or want ACPI code.
Especially for the NUMAQ, I don't think we should even mess with this
too much.  Just fix it in the build system and directly disallow NUMAQ
&& ACPI. 
We already have this:
menu "ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support"
        depends on !X86_VISWS
Just add the NUMAQ in there, too.
