I guess you could do it a number of ways. Maybe having GFP_USERMAP
set __GFP_USERMAP|__GFP_COMP, and the arm dma memory allocator can
strip the __GFP_COMP.
If you get an explicit __GFP_COMP passed down, the allocator doesn't
know whether that was because they want a user mappable area, or
really want a compound page (in which case, stripping __GFP_COMP is
the wrong thing to do).

Hacks usually are ;) It would get you working though.
If you want to write a patch that would be appreciated, that would be
appreciated.
