more progress on the OSS/maestro front.  Output is feeling much better
now.  It doesn't leak memory and doesn't jitter when you don't feed it
quickly enough.  Happiness.
Its still quite sick on some chip/codec pairs, this is annoying me to no
end.  I'd appreciate if people could send me blindingly specific reports
on hardware success/failure.  Its expected to work on most simple maestro
1/2 single codec setups, but when you start getting into 2e multi codec
docking nuttiness the forecast gets grim.
recording is still hopelessly broken and there are still weird mixer
interface barfos, both of which I intend to address next.
evil mmap() hacks may happen eventually also.
oh, right:
