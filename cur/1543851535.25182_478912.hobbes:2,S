I really like portable stuff :)

Whoa, thanks you for the long explanation. May 2.6.18-new vmalloc
related functions help correlating userspace & kernel addresses? I
will try them and come with an answer tomorrow.
Quoting 
http://lwn.net/Articles/2.6-kernel-api/
"Some functions have been added to make it easy for kernel code to
allocate a buffer with vmalloc() and map it into user space. They are:
     void *vmalloc_user(unsigned long size);
     void *vmalloc_32_user(unsigned long size);
     int remap_vmalloc_range(struct vm_area_struct *vma, void *addr,
                             unsigned long pgoff);
The first two functions are a form of vmalloc() which obtain memory
intended to be mapped into user space; among other things, they zero
the entire range to avoid leaking data. vmalloc_32_user() allocates
low memory only. A call to remap_vmalloc_range() will complete the
job; it will refuse, however, to remap memory which has not been
allocated with one of the two functions above."
