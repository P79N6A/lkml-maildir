I'll try the suggestions you sent. regarding the esp -- iI foirgot to
mention that it also crashes when I unplug the connection from a router
and reconnect to the E2864i. it even sometimes crashes when somebody
calls in (e.g. faxes are received) or if I push the front switches that
emit data to the esp card.
weird. note that I use OSS drivers, not builtin sound. maybe an option
to check out too. to me it sounds like corruption in memory that causes
the crash.
