Isn't this loop transferring the dirty state from the upper
filesystem to the lower filesystem? What I don't see here is
how the pages on this filesystem are not getting cleaned if
the lower filesystem is being flushed properly.
I'm probably missing something big and obvious, but I'm not
familiar with the exact workings of FUSE so please excuse my
ignorance....

This is the lower filesystem? Or a callback thread for
doing the write requests to the lower filesystem?

Hmmm - the situation in balance_dirty_pages() after an attempt
to writeback_inodes(&wbc) that has written nothing because there
is nothing to write would be:
	wbc->nr_write == write_chunk &&
	wbc->pages_skipped == 0 &&
	wbc->encountered_congestion == 0 &&
	!bdi_congested(wbc->bdi)
What happens if you make that an exit condition to the loop?
Or alternatively, adding another bit to the wbc structure to
say "there was nothing to do" and setting that if we find
list_empty(&sb->s_dirty) when trying to flush dirty inodes."
[ FWIW, this may also solve another problem of fast block devices
being throttled incorrectly when a slow block dev is consuming
all the dirty pages... ]
Cheers,
Dave.
