Hi all
I'm pleased to present this patch which improves linux futexes performance and 
scalability, merely avoiding taking mmap_sem rwlock.
Ulrich agreed with the API and said glibc work could start as soon
as he gets a Fedora kernel with it :)
Andrew, could we get this in mm as well ? This version is against 2.6.21-rc5-mm4
(so supports 64bit futexes)
In this third version I dropped the NUMA optims and process private hash table,
to let new API come in and be tested.
Thank you
[PATCH] FUTEX : new PRIVATE futexes
Analysis of current linux futex code :
--------------------------------------
A central hash table futex_queues[] holds all contexts (futex_q) of waiting 
threads.
Each futex_wait()/futex_wait() has to obtain a spinlock on a hash slot to 
perform lookups or insert/deletion of a futex_q.
When a futex_wait() is done, calling thread has to :
1) - Obtain a read lock on mmap_sem to be able to validate the user pointer
     (calling find_vma()). This validation tells us if the futex uses
     an inode based store (mapped file), or mm based store (anonymous mem)
2) - compute a hash key
3) - Atomic increment of reference counter on an inode or a mm_struct
4) - lock part of futex_queues[] hash table
5) - perform the test on value of futex.
                (rollback is value != expected_value, returns EWOULDBLOCK)
        (various loops if test triggers mm faults)
6) queue the context into hash table, release the lock got in 4)
7) - release the read_lock on mmap_sem
   <block>
8) Eventually unqueue the context (but rarely, as this part
 may be done by the futex_wake())
Futexes were designed to improve scalability but current implementation
has various problems :
- Central hashtable :
 This means scalability problems if many processes/threads want to use
 futexes at the same time.
 This means NUMA unbalance because this hashtable is located on one node.
- Using mmap_sem on every futex() syscall :
 Even if mmap_sem is a rw_semaphore, up_read()/down_read() are doing atomic
 ops on mmap_sem, dirtying cache line :
        - lot of cache line ping pongs on SMP configurations.
 mmap_sem is also extensively used by mm code (page faults, mmap()/munmap())
 Highly threaded processes might suffer from mmap_sem contention.
 mmap_sem is also used by oprofile code. Enabling oprofile hurts threaded
programs because of contention on the mmap_sem cache line.
- Using an atomic_inc()/atomic_dec() on inode ref counter or mm ref counter:
 It's also a cache line ping pong on SMP. It also increases mmap_sem hold time
 because of cache misses.
Most of these scalability problems come from the fact that futexes are in
one global namespace. As we use a central hash table, we must make sure
they are all using the same reference (given by the mm subsystem).
We chose to force all futexes be 'shared'. This has a cost.
But fact is POSIX defined PRIVATE and SHARED, allowing clear separation, and
optimal performance if carefuly implemented. Time has come for linux to have 
better threading performance.
The goal is to permit new futex commands to avoid :
 - Taking the mmap_sem semaphore, conflicting with other subsystems.
 - Modifying a ref_count on mm or an inode, still conflicting with mm or fs.
This is possible because, for one process using PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE
futexes, we only need to distinguish futexes by their virtual address, no
matter the underlying mm storage is.
If glibc wants to exploit this new infrastructure, it should use new
_PRIVATE futex subcommands for PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE futexes. And
be prepared to fallback on old subcommands for old kernels. Using one
global variable with the FUTEX_PRIVATE_FLAG or 0 value should be OK.
PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED futexes should still use the old subcommands.
Compatibility with old applications is preserved, they still hit the
scalability problems, but new applications can fly :)
Note : the same SHARED futex (mapped on a file) can be used by old binaries 
*and* new binaries, because both binaries will use the old subcommands.
Note : Vast majority of futexes should be using PROCESS_PRIVATE semantic,
as this is the default semantic. Almost all applications should benefit
of this changes (new kernel and updated libc)
Some bench results on a Pentium M 1.6 GHz (SMP kernel on a UP machine)
/* calling futex_wait(addr, value) with value != *addr */
434 cycles per futex(FUTEX_WAIT) call (mixing 2 futexes)
427 cycles per futex(FUTEX_WAIT) call (using one futex)
345 cycles per futex(FUTEX_WAIT_PRIVATE) call (mixing 2 futexes)
345 cycles per futex(FUTEX_WAIT_PRIVATE) call (using one futex)
For reference :
187 cycles per getppid() call
188 cycles per umask() call
183 cycles per ni_syscall() call
