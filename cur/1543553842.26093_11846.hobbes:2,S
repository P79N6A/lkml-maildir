Plese add power-saving devices like in notebooks to the list as well.
For example in my notebook the PC speaker loops through the maestro-3e.
The BIOS is initializing the maestro with some sane mixer values but
after
a suspend cycle the pc speaker is compleatly off due to suspension of
the
maestro-3e chip and the leak of a *permanent* driver sitting around to
handle
the wakeup event.

And the pain for the user of the whole: Take the example of ALSA
over-modularisation...
