You can find tons of examples (several of them patches by Al Viro to fix them) by
searching with google with keywords like "devfs races". The "should fix" list
(
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/must-fix
) has this:
hch: devfs: there's a fundamental lookup vs devfsd race that's only
  fixable by introducing a lookup vs devfs deadlock.  I can't see how this is
  fixable without getting rid of the current devfsd design.  Mandrake seems
  to have a workaround for this so this is at least not triggered so easily,
  but that's not what I'd consider a fix..
