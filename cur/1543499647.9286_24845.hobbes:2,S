Look at this from alt-sysRq M:
....
Free pages:        1540kB [385 (128 256 384)]
    90*4kB 65*8kB 8*16kB 1*32kB 0*64kB 2*128kB 1*256kB 1*512kB 
            1*1024kB 5*2048kB = 13328kB
Free DMA pages:     948kB [237]
    1*4kB 2*8kB 2*16kB 2*32kB 1*64kB 0*128kB 1*256kB 1*512kB
	    0*1024kB 0*2048kB = 948kB
....
Over 1 MB gone below the 16 MB level (ie the "Free DMA pages"
entry) and this system is hardly doing anything. Why?

The SCSI sub-system (mid level to be precise) has gobbled 
it up. And the more adapters, devices and high level
drivers I load, the more it will want. Then there is
sound, floppy drivers and probably more besides.
2 MB may not be enough. Perhaps the DMA buffers size could a 
parameter to the linux kernel and/or a /proc/sys/kernel
entry as well. It could be scaled up if memory >= 128 MB
and scaled back if memory <= 24 MB (just guessing ...).
