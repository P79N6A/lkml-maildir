This seems to be a blind spot of mine.  Yours is the second complaint in 
two days about patches I failed to CC to the appropriate 
maintainer/mailing-list...

Please submit a similar bugfix for pci_get_class, then.  I just noticed 
the log messages from pci_get_subsys because that's the routine that 
happened to run on the machine I was testing.

It is a bug, but it has been ignored up until recently.  Within the last 
month or two, Greg added a might_sleep() call to put_device().  It 
wouldn't hurt to do the same thing to kobject_put(), or maybe just 
kobject_release().
