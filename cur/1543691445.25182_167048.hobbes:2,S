	Not sure if it's related but I've had problems with PCMCIA support in
the test kernels myself... The Cisco Aironet 350 has problems and I've
been able to make any use of the Orinoco Gold wireless card...
Fortunately the ethernet card is built in on PCI bus and doesn't have
any problem but I had being corded down...
	Regards,
