Ok, will get that. Someone else emailed me a url and I tried that earlier 
on (ages ago it seems) it said version 0.0.4 and it displayed a lot of crap 
on a 2.5.14 running kernel. Certainly it bears no resemblance to what 
/proc/ide/via has to say and it certainly bears no resemblance to 
reality... )-: i hope...

>(besides, sysctl interface gives you ascii in /proc/sys/)
It does indeed (if implemented). Agreed if Martin were to change to sysctl 
with /proc interface great, it would just mean /proc/ide becomes 
/proc/sys/ide, nothing against that....

Probably... I agree sysctl is great. I use it in ntfs myself. (-: And i 
think the /proc/sys is very nice... And for people who don't like it or who 
don;'t compile /proc fs they can use _sysctl...
Cheers,
