Lets see, somebody can develop lab equipment (dont think on PTRs or
thermistors in common world) that givee 10e-3 precission, and you are just
making linux not suitable to control that hardware. Think open.
What is the real difference between managing temperatures with a short
or a long ?. Is it really needed to fit it in a short ??!!!
I would use an unsigned long with fixed point and all done.
