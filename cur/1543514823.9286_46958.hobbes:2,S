In mm/memory.c:remap_pte_range() __va() gets a real physical address as
argument and not an offset. Here you have to take care that __va() returns
either a valid virtual kernel address for MAP_NR() or it has to return an
(arbitrary) invalid virtual address, so that following test against
max_mapnr is true. If you don't do this, you have problems mapping video
or kernel memory into user space, so that either nothing is mapped at all
or the wrong pages are freed, when the user mapping is released.
Only MAP_NR() has to return an offset into mem_map, but __va()/__pa()
could be used on m68k to provide faster variants of phys_to_virt() and
virt_to_phys() if possible, whereof the mm system could benefit from this.

So far that wasn't really a problem since the mm system only worked with
virtual address and the translation between physical and virtual mapping
was completly architecture specific. Now bootmem.c makes an exception to
that, but adding an dynamic start would reduce the problem, since it's
only a simple bitfield and freed after booting.
