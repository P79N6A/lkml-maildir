Do you mean that the user space code always passes the framebuffer's bus
address directly to bttv, and not the user-space mapped address?
And that the option to pass a user space address to VIDIOCSFBUF and have
it translated, while making wild assumptions about the object mapped
into user space that by the right 1000000-1 piece of luck happen not to
trample random pages, is never used?
Or do you mean it is used but there's always a framebuffer there, as
luck would have it.
