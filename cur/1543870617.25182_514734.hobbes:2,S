The RSS bits really worry me, since it looks like they could
exacerbate the scalability problems that we are already running
into on very large memory systems.
Linux is *not* happy on 256GB systems.  Even on some 32GB systems
the swappiness setting *needs* to be tweaked before Linux will even
run in a reasonable way.
Pageout scanning needs to be more efficient, not less.  The RSS
bits are worrysome...
