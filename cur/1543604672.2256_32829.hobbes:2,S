Hi
I compiled qsbench under windows 2000
And get some interesting results:
Under my linux kernel  2.4.9-ac18
localhost:~/test/qs_bench > time ./qsbench -n 90000000 -p 1 -s 14538
seed = 14538
 
real    1m50.442s
user    1m48.410s
sys     0m1.660s
And under windows with same parameters:
seed = 14538
time = 48s
--
seed = 14538
time = 47s
--
seed = 14538
time = 48s
May be this comparison is't correctly
but so large difference!
Any comments?
