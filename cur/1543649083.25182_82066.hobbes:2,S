But in the copyright assignment request, the FSF states:
"   However, upon thirty days` prior written notice, the Foundation
agrees to grant me non-exclusive rights to use the program as I see

Doesn't this mean that the author still has copyrights on his work,
provided he tells the FSF within one month ?
