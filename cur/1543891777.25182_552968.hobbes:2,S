I've forwarded you the full mail. To quote Nitin Gupta:

So its author admits it isn't ready yet. I'm not saying that code is bad
or shouldn't be included, just that we've ascertained it isn't ready
*yet*. Which brings us back to my last mail and its proposal.

The zlib code isn't kernel style and is arguably bloated, perhaps we
should remove that?
If Nitin or others can fix that patch, fine but I can't afford the time
to do it and until those issues are fixed, it isn't ready.
Also, Nitin has already claimed several times that he's made no
functional changes to that code only to find that actually there are
functional changes. That does give rise to concern (not least for
security). There are ways to address this but I don't have time to do it
so it needs someone, preferably independent who has.

I have done and they are aware of it.

This is not FUD, I've actually done things to help the other LZO
implementation forward but my available time to help is limited.
Note that I am not the only person to have expressed concerns with the
alternative LZO implementation and some questions raised by others as
well as myself regarding some of the code differences still remain
unanswered too.
