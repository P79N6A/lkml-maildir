Subject: [PATCH] export getledstate()

I write adapters for disabled people, and we often have to do
specialized functions based on keystrokes and key chords.
I would like to do certain things when keys are hit and num lock is on,
but there is no easy way to get the led state.
There is a nice function getledstate()
in keyboard.c, it just isn't exported.
Here is the patch that would do that.
Can you apply this patch, or, is there another easy way to get this information,
or, would it be better to fold this information into keyboard_notifier_param,
along with shift state etc.
I use notifiers, so this would be natural, and almost as easy.
I'd be happy to write that patch, if you think that would be a superior design.
