Nor would I. 
What I do in my numerics code to avoid this problem, is to create all the
threads (as many as there are CPUs) on program startup and have then wait
(block) for a condition. As soon as there's something to to, variables for
the thread are setup (protected by a mutex) and the thread gets signalled
(cond_signal).
If you're interested in the code, tell me.
This is supposed to be much faster than thread creation.
