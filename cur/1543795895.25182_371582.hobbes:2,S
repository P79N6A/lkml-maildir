Hello, 0602.  :-)
Can you please post dmesg of a successful booting?  That will tell us 
which SATA controller/disks you are using.  Also, the boot log of a 
failed boot will be very helpful - the best way to get this is via 
serial console.  If you don't have access to serial console, taking note 
   / picture of the part where SATA detection fails will do too.
Also, when the machine boots successfully, does it work without 
generating disk related kernel logs?  Just perform any IO-heavy 
operations - cp'ing directories which contain large files, 
tar/untarring... - and see if the kernel complains about anyting.
