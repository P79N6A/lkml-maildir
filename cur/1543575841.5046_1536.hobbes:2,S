Then I don't think that I can explain why it works with gcc-2.7.2.3.
My particular setup is:
- 3 PCI NE2000 cards and 1 ISA NE2000 card.
The isa card worked always but from the PCI cards only one worked (I just
ifconfig ethX up; tcpdump -i ethX -nlqt and I see no packets there, I also
see no interrupts from that cards too, so this may be related to pci code).
Anyway, as I said before, with gcc-2.7.2.3 it works fine.
.. ah, and something else: first I had a EtherExpress Pro 10/100 card which
behaved in the same way but I thought I have a bus-mastering problem with
PCI cards so I replaced it.
