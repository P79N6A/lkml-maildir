Hey, it's not that there wasn't enough work in other places...  I've
picked the patch above for -bird and will happily leave further sata
stuff to you, TYVM ;-)
Speaking of which, since -bk5 is out there now...  Could you drop the delta
between it and your current netdev-2.6 somewhere on anonftp?  AFAICS there
are 6 patches missing from the pile I've sent to you (3 out of them with
objections I've seen + 1 you've asked to postpone), but there's another
pile waiting to be sent (11 more)...
