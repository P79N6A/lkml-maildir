Is there a specific reason why they are blocked? 
For example I'm looking at making changes to DRM such that DRM will
require the corresponding framebuffer driver to be loaded. If you back
up further this is part of fixing X so that it won't mess with the
hardware from user space. Mode setting would come from the framebuffer
driver instead of the X 2D XAA driver.
