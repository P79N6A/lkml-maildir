Because O_DIRECT needs a specific o_direct I/O method that has not yet
been written for ext3.  I believe only ext2 and reiserfs support it
right now.  I will eventually need to add support for this, but it is
not yet high on my list of priorities.  Maybe someone else will beat
me to it.
Cheers, Andreas
