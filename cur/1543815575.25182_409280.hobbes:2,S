Here's the latest version of my patch to fix the mem leak in alloc_kmemlist().
It should address Pekkas's comments.
Andrew: Do you think this could go into -mm and get some field testing, so 
perhaps it has a chance of making 2.6.17?
Fix memory leak in mm/slab.c::alloc_kmemlist().
If one allocation fails we have to roll-back all allocations made up to the 
point of failure.
