I want the new fb stuff very badly.
My particular application is a game which has it's own software 3D renderer, 
so it just needs to be able to blast the frames into video ram. A good fbdev 
would mean not needing X, which would be nice.
Please consider this for inclusion in very early 2.7. And I urge James to work 
with Linus on this. Perhaps when it's stable in 2.7, we can back-port to 
2.6 :)
