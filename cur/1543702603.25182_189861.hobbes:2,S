Transparency of an autofs filesystem (as I'm calling it) is the situation
where, given a map
/usr	/man1	server:/usr/man1
	/man2	server:/usr/man2
where the filesystem /usr contains, say a directory lib, that needs to be
available while also seeing the automounted directories.

This is the 2.4 code. I do (or though I was able to) use the vfsmount_lock
in the 2.6 patches I have in
kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/raven/autofs4-2.6. This is bad for me.

Or any umount when sending the expire request to userspace.
