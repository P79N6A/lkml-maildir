I tried the converter on a XP machine and unfortunately while using the 
manufacturer provided drivers I was unable to produce a break :-(
As a last resort I tried Belkins tech support line. The first time I called I 
was told the product (F5U109ea) was designed for PDA use only and it would 
generate breaks fine if connected to them. Admittedly it is marketed as such 
(
http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=103226
). I was 
told to buy a F5U103 instead 
(
http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=66002
). Not 
happy with this I rang back to talk to another person, this time I was not 
fobbed off as quickly and although the tech support guy did not know what a 
break was, he offered to look into it and call me back. I've not heard back 
(yet), but I'm not too surprised.
Interestingly I got my hands on a F5U103 and it works fine (uses another chip 
and consequently module). However they are so much more bulky I don't think 
I'm going to bother changing over.
Thanks for all the help :-)
Regards
