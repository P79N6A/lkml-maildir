I am against any API which provides this.  It can be extremely
expensive to do this on some architectures, and since the rest
of the PCI dma API does not provide such an interface neither
should the pool routines.
Drivers can keep track of this kind of information themselves,
and that is what I tell every driver author to do who complains
of a lack of a "bus_to_virt()" type thing, it's just lazy
programming.
