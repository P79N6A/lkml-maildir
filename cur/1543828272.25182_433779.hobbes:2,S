For demonstration purpose, maybe you could use tsk->uid to group tasks and 
and see how capping at group level works out? Basically cap the per-user cpu
usage.

For "effective number" do you include only runnable tasks? As and when
this number changes, you would need to go and change the per-task cap of
all tasks in the group. Any idea what the cost of that operation would
be? Or do you intend to do it lazily to amortize some of that cost?
