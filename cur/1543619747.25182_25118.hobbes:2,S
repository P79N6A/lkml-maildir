You probably want to get the actual documentation and read it - there are
a set of guarantees that I/O's do not pass one another. A read will not pass
a write for example. When you think about PCI as a message passing system
in both directions its generally a lot better for your head 8). The guarantees
are also defined in terms of PCI functions rather than a single port
