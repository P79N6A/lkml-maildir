ACK.
Will be fixed ASAP.

I did my best to keep the old interface (sprint_symbol), char arrays and
all, fixing only the critical dump_stack path. (Hence, print_symbol no
longer calls sprint_symbol - it calls the __sprint_symbol helper
function instead.

As I'm keeping the old interface (with it's static char arrays) for
non-dump_stack paths, there's no need to use locks around sprint_symbol.

Yep. Still needs work.
... I'll get there. Dead or alive. ;)

The -best- solution is to use locking in normal circumstances (E.g.
debug code, sleep while atomic ,etc) -but- drop all locks when BUG/Oops
is being hit.
I believe the next patch will take care of this problem.
