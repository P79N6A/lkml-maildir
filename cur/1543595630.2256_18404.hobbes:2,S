You don't get much more end-user than a $2500 Dual Processor Mac G4. 
(And as soon as you say $2500 is a lot of money, I can probably find a 
dual CPU PentiumIII system for < $1000)
We would be perfectly happy if you have the time and ability to maintain a 
fork that can do all of this, and those of us that have more than one CPU 
type will be perfectly happy to ignore it.
