Subject: reiserfs problem with 2.6.15.[234]

The fix that enables the ReiserFS mount options causes my machine (whose
root filesystem is on reiserfs) to instantly reboot. No idea why, I
suspect some mount option enabled by default causes problems, but other
machines with similar configurations seems unaffected.
I'll take my problem to the reiserfs list, I just wanted to give you an
indication that even that oh-so-simple-bugfix can cause trouble.
