Good stuff :-)
Is there any news on Marvell progress? I'll get my hands dirty on a 
shipment with servers using the chips on friday, I may be able to sneak 
in some testing before deployment (they will be rewired to use ICH5-R 
for now)
Hmm, I wonder if there is any AHCI PCI(-X/E) plug-in boards planned. 
That would be nice indeed. Seems like SATAII-like features on PCI-boards 
are bound to Marvell or hardware RAID cards like 3ware 9xxx or newer LSI 
MegaRAID currently.
