Again, in my post that you snipped you didn't either read or understand
what I was saying regarding QoS, nor about the large scale issues regarding
dual/single kernel development environments. Ultimately this stuff requires
non-trivial support in kernel space, a softirq thread migration mechanism
and a frame driven scheduler to back IO submission across async boundaries.
My posts where pretty clear on this topic and lot of this has origins
coming from SGI IRIX. Yes, SGI IRIX. One of the only system man enough
to handle this stuff.
Ancient, antiquated Unix scheduler semantics (sort and run) and lack of
control over critical facilities like softirq processing are obstacles
to getting at this.
