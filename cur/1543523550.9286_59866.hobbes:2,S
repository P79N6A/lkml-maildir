cwd needs to be changed too, along with root. But I only touch them if
they are exactly at the current root. If something cared enough to
change them in the first place, it's probably wrong to touch them.
Also, anything but root and cwd (i.e. open files, opendir'ed directories,
executables, shared libraries, etc.) is not touched. You can get rid of
most of the nasty stuff with a simple exec, or by killing the process.
Fortunately, the most common cases, i.e. the /linuxrc script (or some
equivalent - we don't have to use a hard-coded name anymore) and kernel
threads are just where we need them. Also, the latter usually don't
access files anyway.
