Kernel gurus,
Since the boot process on some SMP machines can be rather verbose, it seems
that the ring buffer for printk()s wraps before it can be snarfed by
klogd/syslogd after boot.
This makes it difficult to troubleshoot messages printed early in the boot
process (like BIOS RAM maps).
The default buffer size is 16k. (kernel/printk.c, line 26) 
Would it be reasonable to increase this to 32k (or more) on most machines? 
The buffer size is set at compile-time, and may present a problem in
limited-memory (embedded?) systems if grown too large.
Comments are most welcome.
Tim
