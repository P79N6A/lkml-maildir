If we can afford to do this (in terms of actions that can be done with the 
machine being unstable) we can certainly print a console message through gdb.
A stub is free to send console messages to gdb at any time. We can send a 
"'O'hex(Page fault at 0x1234)" packet to gdb regardless of whether 
CONFIG_KGDB_CONSOLE is configured in. This way kgdb will send this packet to 
gdb and then immediately report a segfault/trap. To a user it'll appear as a 
message printed from gdb "Page fault at 0x1234" followed by gdb showing a 
SIGSEGV etc. The gdb console message should print information other than a 
signal number.
