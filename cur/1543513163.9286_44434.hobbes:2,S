  It looks like some of the memory_end changes between 2.3.21 and 2.3.22
didn't get made for the CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD block.
	...
	gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/h/src/kernel/linux-2.3.22/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fno-strength-reduce  -DCPU=686 -march=i686   -c -o setup.o setup.c
	setup.c: In function `setup_arch':
	setup.c:622: `memory_end' undeclared (first use in this function)
	setup.c:622: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
	setup.c:622: for each function it appears in.)
	make[1]: *** [setup.o] Error 1
	make[1]: Leaving directory `/mnt/h/src2/kernel/linux-2.3.22/arch/i386/kernel'
	make: *** [_dir_arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
  No easy fix (at least not for me).  (:
  For now I've disabled CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD, which lets it compile.
