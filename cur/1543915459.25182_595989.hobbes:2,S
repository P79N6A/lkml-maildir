ditto.

Hmm, don't we intend to push this array out of the stack too?

+	static DEFINE_SPINLOCK(namebuf_lock);
here ?

And you'd need to wrap spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_unlock_irqrestore()
around this call.

Try to keep the declarations of a lock, and the data that it protects,
close together. Since this lock is being used to protect "buffer", it
makes sense to ...

... have it:
+	static DEFINE_SPINLOCK(buffer_lock);
here (note the name that exactly describes what the lock protects).
And the namebuf array isn't required here, it's already there in
sprint_symbol(), which you can call from ...

here ... sprint_symbol() ?

But I still don't much like this :-(
More importantly, if a panic occurs *below* this callchain (and let's
say we ended up in this callchain because somebody put in a dump_stack()
somewhere for debugging purposes), then we'd have a deadlock on our hands,
and nothing gets printed for that panic.
I don't know who maintains this part of kernel code, but you can try
resubmitting (with the changes suggested above) to someone appropriate ...
