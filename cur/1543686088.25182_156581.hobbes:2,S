In fact, it works untill I switch to another console...
What is the right way to change the console configuration at run-time,
now ? Or where should I look for this info ?
Did it become impossible (would be a severe bug, at least for me...) ?

OK, you confirm exactly the symptom I have seen.
So it seems to be an X driver problem...
But X is still buggy when it doesn't use DRI,
at least in 32 bits modes. I know it's quite certain that it's an X bug,
but I really would like to understand why it works with 2.4 kernels
and not with 2.6 ones. The X problem is there even if I use the VGA
console (I mean with a kernel with fb support _not_ activated).
Thanks for the infos.
Regards.
