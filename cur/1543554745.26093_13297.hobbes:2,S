Known problem.  Fixed with a new make modules_install algorithm in 2.4
kernels.  Back porting that change to 2.2 would force all 2.2 users to
upgrade to modutils 2.3.  AC does not want forced user space upgrades
in the stable kernel (and I agree).  So you are stuck with the broken
modutles install.
