In my case, it's easily reproducible. Below is a mainline 2.6.19.
Look at both %CPU and TIME+ (sched_time).
top - 10:55:00 up 33 min,  8 users,  load average: 1.07, 0.61, 0.51
Tasks:  76 total,   2 running,  74 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
Cpu(s): 76.0% us,  0.3% sy,  0.0% ni, 23.7% id,  0.0% wa,  0.0% hi,  0.0% si
Mem:    256592k total,   251888k used,     4704k free,    46516k buffers
Swap:   272120k total,     4924k used,   267196k free,    90048k cached
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 8113 dimm      15   0  1460  436  360 R 74.4  0.2   1:43.63 fairtest_xx
 8114 dimm      15   0  1460  108   32 S  0.3  0.0   0:00.15 fairtest_xx
If you take a look at my previous report, you'll also notice
"strangeness" with both cpu% and sched_time.
sched_clock() is based on "tsc" and it's available for my CPU. So
maybe something fishy is going on with accounting.
I just wonder, why it's so easily reproducible in my case for both
mainline and SD (besides a 2.6.13 mainline, but I have to re-run all
the tests letting tenp run longer for the "sched_time" to be
accumulated)...
