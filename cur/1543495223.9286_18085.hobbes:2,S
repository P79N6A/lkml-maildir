Subject: REQ: Olicom TokenRing Driver in main kernel tree?

As you can see at
http://eolicom.olicom.dk/~storner/,
there are Olicom TR-Drivers for linux. They are included in SuSE (afaik) and
work (without any trouble).
When will they be included in the kernel tree? 2.3. or maybe 2.2.8(9)?
at least in "development or unstable drivers".
thx,
Phil
