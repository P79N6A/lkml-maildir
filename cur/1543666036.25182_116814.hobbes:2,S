What you could do is have a CVS "realtime" branch which is forked from the
trunk, say once a week, or whenever Linux makes a point release.  On this
branch you do incremental updates as they are merged into CVS.  When it is
time to create a new branch (say for 2.5.99-pre12), you re-do the export from
the branch base tag (at 2.5.99-pre11) to the current BK head in an "optimal"
way, and retag the "realtime" branch off of the new base tag.
We do this in our current CVS development, and CVS is smart enough to keep
local changes over the update and/or generate conflicts.  That way, most
people can have a simple-but-good trunk to follow, but people who want
up-to-the-second updates can have it too, and you don't end up renumbering
the CVS revisions for times in the past.  It also avoids the need to re-crunch
the entire BK repository to get an optimal path (which is only going to get
slower as time goes on, and I'm not sure whether Linux development is ahead
of or behind Moore's law).
Cheers, Andreas
