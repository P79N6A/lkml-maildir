I assume "128 megs" is a typo, it's 128k, of course.  And certainly it
would have helped speed things up, not just benchmarks, because for
modern disks, doing 128k vs 4k takes like 25% more time.  Wu's
adaptive readahead patches might make this outdated, though, since
they now support "read 10 pages, seek, read 10 pages, seek, etc" type
workloads.
