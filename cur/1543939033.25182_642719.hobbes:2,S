If hardware configuration is selected at the bootup time, by jumpers
or switches, it's even easier to do it right. Without pio-map.

Why you need to modify the device tree for that? Let the U-Boot simply
setup pins for the kernel. Regarding kernel overwriting pins
configuration...

What I've understood from the previous debates, is that ideally kernel
should not touch pins' configuration. Today we're using pio-map solely
to fix up some old firmware misconfiguration. And we can do this in the
board file still. To determine if we need to fixup the firmware or not,
we can use some device tree property instead (firmware version?).
p.s.
I'm neither for pio-map nor against. I just want some consequence
regarding this. Last thread ended with consequence that pio-map is a
bad thing to use...
