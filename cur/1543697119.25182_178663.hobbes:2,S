schedule() is the kernel procedure that gives the CPU to somebody
while your code is waiting for something to happen. You cannot
call that in an interrupt or when a lock is held.
current->policy is a member of 'current' a pointer to a structure
that completely defines the current task being executed. It exists
inside the kernel. You don't need to create a task. Lots of tasks
already exist.
