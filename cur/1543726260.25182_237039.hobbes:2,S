Greetings all;
I just had another crash, but this one was different.
/dev/hda5 developed an error and was remounted read
only by the system.  As thats /root, everything pretty
much came to a screeching halt several hours ago while
I was out carving the tapered ends on some split rail
fencing, a somewhat dangerous job because its arsenic
treated wood, and I made a large leaf bag of sawdust
and wood chips with bare hands and no resperator filter
device.
Here is the log for the event:
---------------

cleared for block 761450

Jul 28 13:37:00 coyote kernel: Remounting filesystem read-only
Jul 28 18:34:29 coyote shutdown: shutting down for system reboot
On the reboot and e2fsck of /dev/hda5, one inode had
zero dtime and was fixed.
This is the third crash today.  I'm now building a plain
2.6.7 to run on this board as thats the newest version that
has a diff in fs/dcache.c, from 2.6.7-mm1 they are all identical.
