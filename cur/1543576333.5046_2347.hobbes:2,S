Hi,
  currently i'm experimenting with some routing
protocols. I need to modify the action taken by the  
kernel after it fails to find a matching route in the
routing cache and the FIB.
i.e after the kernel calls ip_route_output() and
ip_route_output_slow() and fails to find a match, i
need the kernel to somehow "hook-up" with a
process/daemon(routing protocol) and access a user
route cache there.
how can i go about doing this?
thanks
