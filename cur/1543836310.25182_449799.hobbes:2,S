Actually we use checksums, not ECC. If checksum is wrong, then run
fsck - it will remove the whole disk cluster, that represent 64K of
data.

Checksum is checked before unsafe decompression (when trying to
decompress incorrect data can lead to fatal things). It can be
broken because of many reasons. The main one is tree corruption
(for example, when disk cluster became incomplete - ECC can not
help here). Perhaps such checksumming is also useful for other
things, I didnt classify the patterns..
