Hi,
a friend of mine talked to a vendor of an usb 2.0/ide adapter.
They told him, that he won't get more than 12mb/sec (and even some different 
adapters we looked at were not faster), and I saw ~8mb/sec copying a large 
file to an elderly  harddisk. This harddisk does ~10mb/sec when connected to 
an ide port.  We had no faster harddisk to test, but I won't blame the ehci 
driver (which worked fine with my SiS746 board), but the adapter ;o).
Glück Auf
Volker
