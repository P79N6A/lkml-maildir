Worried.  As far as the filesytem is concerned, its mmap has succeeded.
But now we're taking the unmap_and_free_vma path _after_ ->mmap() has
"succeeded".  So we will now tell userspace that the mmap syscall has
failed, even though the fs thinks it succeeded, if you follow me.  And this
is a new thing.  
Could it cause bad things to happen?  Well, if filesystems had a
file_operations.munmap() then yeah, we should have called that in your new
code.  But filesystems don't have a ->munmap() method.
Still.  Can we think of any way in which this change could lead to resource
leaks or to any other such problems?
