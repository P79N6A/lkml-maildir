Yes, I'm all for the full cpumask abstraction.

No, by getting at the internals, I mean the internals of the
type itself. Its implementation, if you will. (Well I guess
that also *includes* users getting the address and derefing it
as an unsigned long).
But no, I was talking about something more general. Rusty wrote:

Now in my opinion, it is either all or nothing. I could be wrong,
but I don't think there is any point with a nice cpumask type if
you are just going to get inside it and do bitmap operations on it.
In summary, I think your patches are nice :)
