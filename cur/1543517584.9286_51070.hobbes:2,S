I can't find complete inline ASM document, so have to ask here!
   int i = 1 ;
   __asm__ ( "
            movl  %0, %%eax\n
            addl  $1, %%eax\n
            movl %eax, %0\n"
            :  : "g"(i)  : "eax, "memory"
    ) ;
  After this statement,  i is 2.
  But if change the input from "g"(i) to "r"(i), then i is still 1.
  In document, "g" is register or memory, "r" is register, what happed
  from "g" to "r" ?
  Thanks!  ( Can any tell me where to find inline ASM document ? )
