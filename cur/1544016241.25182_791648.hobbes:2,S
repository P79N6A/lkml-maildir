If the initrd is not decompressed successfully, and if it's not there for fun,
the system boot will be most likely fubar, and at worst a wrong system or a
less secured configuration may be started. Therefore I'd create a kernel
option. Possible values would be e.g. [*panic,continue] or 
[*auto|required|optional|ignore], with:
panic, continue: As expected
auto: If there is an initrd, it's required, otherwise it's ignored
required: Panic if the initrd did not exist or was not unpacked correctly
optional: Like continue
ignore: Don't load the initrd
*: Default value
I currently don't know how to name the option.
