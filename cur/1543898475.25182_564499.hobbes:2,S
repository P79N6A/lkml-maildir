The oops logger uses oops_in_progress variable to detect the begin and the 
end of an oops.  The end is detected when the first non-oops line comes and
oops_in_progress is false.
This works if the kernel is still running after the oops and gemerates some 
non-oops messages.  But if there is no non-oops line following an oops, no
flushing will occur and there won't be a log on flash.
