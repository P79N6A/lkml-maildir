It is possible that these changes can break the pi code in rtmutex.c.  I
haven't analyzed it enough yet.  But just so that you know that your
changes don't break the code, and to make it easier for me to look at
it. Please update Documentation/rt-mutex-design.txt including your
changes.  This will be a good exercise to see if it doesn't really break
anything, and it will give other reviewers a better starting point for
review.
