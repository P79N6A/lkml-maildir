OK, I think I'm clear on this much then:  in 2.5, to support block drivers
over USB (usb-storage only, for now) there needs to be an addition to
the buffer addressing model in usbcore, as exposed by URBs.
  - Current "transfer_buffer" + "transfer_buffer_length" mode needs to
    stay, since most drivers aren't block drivers.
  - Add some kind of "page + offset" addressing model.
Discussion of details can be taken off LKML, it'd seem.  Though I'm
curious when the scatterlist->address field will vanish, making these
changes a requirement.  Is that a 2.5.2 thing?
Also, I noticed that include/asm-sparc/pci.h doesn't include the
standard pci_map_page() call ... what's up with that?  That surely
causes portability problems.
