The Summit machines (the only x86 user of the SRAT) have other hardware
guarantees about alignment, so I guess that's why we've never
encountered it.  Are you using the SRAT on non-Summit hardware?  That
doesn't seem possible:
arch/i386/Kconfig:
        config ACPI_SRAT
                bool
                default y
                depends on NUMA && (X86_SUMMIT || X86_GENERICARCH)

I didn't say "run the latest kernel tree".  *In* the latest kernel
tree :)
