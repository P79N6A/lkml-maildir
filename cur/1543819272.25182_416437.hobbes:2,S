I wonder why people like '!' as a replacement for '/'. It's nasty for 
shell expansion, and it looks visually strange too (at least to me). 
Wouldn't it be a lot nicer to just use something like '.' or ':' instead, 
which is not as visually! distracting! and! screaming!
As to whether it's simpler to just use a character-at-a-time comparison 
over strchr, I dunno. Maybe.
