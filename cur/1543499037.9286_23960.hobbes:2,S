I don't know if this will affect anything but you might want to try
the BIOS Version 207-2 located at:
ftp://ftp.asuscom.de/pub/ASUSCOM/BIOS/Socket_7/INTEL_Chipset/i430HX/P_I-xP55T2P4
x/0207_02.zip
It mainly (I think IIRC) added support for CTX cores on the K6-2/3 (which is a
nice suprise for such an old motherboard)) but it may help with your problem...
although, if I remember right, it is a generic HX chipset buglet which
kinda-sorta supports an early revision UDMA/33.
Great motherboard though.. have one running next to me as a file server/etc.
