Very much so! I can not agree more with you that the lack of a default
good policy is stupid -- this is why X was in such a bad state for years!
I could write pages on this subject, but I'm glad other people share my
ideas in this matter :)
That being said, I have nothing against an automatic algorithm. If we can
get that one to do what we want, there's obviously no need for knobs. All
I'm saying is that *if* there are cases where we need help, we should not
have to tweak the priority of a process, but create a different knob.
Priority is a different beast from interactivity. For example, it's clear
that good interactive behaviour _requires_ information only available in
the kernel. Which makes the interactivity know (if at all required) more
of a hint rather than a set in stone thing like the priority.
But I guess all this is academic. If the automatic stuff just works, 
we're better off anyway.
