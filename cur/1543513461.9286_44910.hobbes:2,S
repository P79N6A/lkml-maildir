What's the matter in making a module if it's un-unloadable?
If I set "net-pf-10 off" in conf-modules, this should prevent ifconfig
to load it even if I have no use for it now, right?
Now an off-topic question. I would like to try ipv6, either in-house
or with a friend over a ham-radio channel. The first problem I've
fround is that I don't know how to set an ipv6 IP address. Where can I
learn more?
