if you've got 64 processors contending on the same resource, maybe you
need to split that resource up so they can have a copy each.  all that
cacheline bouncing can't do your numa boxes any good.

i hear x86-64 has a lockless gettimeofday.  maybe that's the solution.

umm.. the call trace:
sys_fstat
|-> vfs_fstat
|   |-> fget
|	|-> read_lock(&files->file_lock)
|   |-> vfs_getattr
|	|-> inode->i_op->getattr
|	|-> generic_fillattr
|-> cp_new_stat64
    |-> memset
    |-> copy_to_user
so you're talking about contention on files->file_lock, right?  it's really
not the kernel's fault that your app is badly written.  that lock's private
to process & children, so it's not like another application can hurt you.

yes, but how slow are they in the uncontended case?
