I made that change -- sorry I broke your patch.
No, I doubt it would matter if you hacked out "if (irq >=16)"
for the time being.
I haven't been following this thread closely, but
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1203
 says I should;-)
I understand that these boards have the timer attached to pin0
in APIC mode, but that the BIOS says it is connected to pin2:
ACPI: INT_SRC_OVR (bus[0] irq[0x0] global_irq[0x2] polarity[0x0]
trigger[0x0])
Wouldn't it be a simpler patch to recognize this board and simply
disable this bogus BIOS INT_SRC_OVR?
Also, what is the symptom of the XT-PIC timer?  Is it the source
of the nForce2 hangs, or something else?  The latest message
suggested that it caused a backround load on the system, but
I don't recall hearing that one on this thread before.
thanks,
