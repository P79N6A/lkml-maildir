You missed the point.  The layering on the X86 memory managment is such:
   Segment
      |
Virtual Address    <- limited to 32 bits
      |
Physical Address
Segmentation never directly gives you a physical address, even in real
mode.  Although in real mode virtual address is hardwired to physical
address.  Virtual addresses are always 32 bits on the x86.  In real
mode, in protected mode, and with PAE enabled.
