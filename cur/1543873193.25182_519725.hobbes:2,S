Yes.  It can, and sometimes does.  There's no way (that I know of) to
tell gcc "all my __thread variables might have moved to a different
address".

There it's easier to make gcc do what we want, because we can use a
barrier or a volatile.  The difference is that smp_processor_id() is
ultimately the value of something, not the address of something.  We
can tell gcc "values might have changed" but have no way to say
"addresses might have changed".
