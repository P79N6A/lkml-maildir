I never said you could get that protection.
What I said was that a law based on how much money you have is wrong.
Someone suggested that patents should only be available for a
certain amount of money.  So I said I would want protection even
for my $10K investment.
I was NOT in any way, shape, form, or fashion suggesting I could
actually get protection, I was simply disagreeing with the idea of
protection level == financial power.
Good grief... making it law can't be anything but worse!
