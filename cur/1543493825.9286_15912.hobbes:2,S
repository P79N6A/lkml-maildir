They whole deal is I'm claiming it is raising power it doesn't have, while
in the section you sniped you refered to it having power in pI. It was
supposed to be a "no kidding" obvious thing. You seemed to need the
obvious pointed out. I am trying to "deal" with it, by fixing it in a
useful manner.

Totaly incompatible? Its more compatible to old behavior than the a. or b.
and if you look at the patch it can even be totaly compatible with b. via
settings in securebits .

Then why not just give them pP since any old admin tool to be useful is
going to raise them caps anyway. *Please* address that issue!! With the
"pure draft" standard you either get useless userland for admin purposes
or you get security holes. Under your system if a user shell has pI and
not pP and you want 'cp', 'dd',etc to be useful for admin purposes then
you might as have given the users shell those same caps in pP.
Do you not see that??!!

Glad you agree that traditional unix behavior is important! Then the draft
doesn't work for you in a secure and traditional compatible fashion.

Yes stricter than current but not strict enough in that pI is just a step
away to becoming pP in a useable system. It obviously is giving you a
false since of security or you really want to strongly break
compatibility.
Do you want to be able to use 'cp' or 'dd' in a cap-enhanced fashion or do
you just want to use newly made custom programs for these purposes?
You *can't* have it both ways with the draft formula.
Which way do you want??!!
Please do answer and either ackknowledge that you can't have it *both*
ways without making that draft formula more restrictive, or showing me
the errors of my ways!!

Great my patch offers compatibility with old behavior and if you are crazy
enough with the "pure draft" formula. securebits controls compatibility
and pP reduces the pI content that gets used to figure pP' .

I do not see where you are getting that from. If the parent has the proper
pP and through its setting of pI it can gain whatever ability it needs.
It will never gain caps unlike your religious objections to anything
stricter than pP'=fP|(pI&fI) . You are so wrong about me needing to set fP
on 'mv' that it is painful. Why do you think I need fP to be set? I don't
think 'mv' should ever raise caps, you think it should.

The draft to be secure requires that must of the common utils be made
unusable for admin purposes. You *have* to make new ones.
I have already talked about how "for untrusted admins" programs 
shouldn't make its security decissions based on caps it has in its pI.
Caps, either my "soiled" or "pure draft" are the wrong answer if you don't
trust your admins.
No Kidding! -- Deal with those apples!
Then the question becomes what is the purpose of pI&fI being able to raise
caps that where not in pP. Answer None.

Warning:
When I mention capabilites I mean "soiled" capabilities not "pure draft".
Any caps I mention are *derived* from a withdrawn draft posix document.
