Umm, the original Ritchie C compiler on the PDP-11 and the Johnson 'Portable' C
compiler both had this extension, as well as every other C compiler under UNIX
(tm) I've ever used or read the documentation for.  It is also mentioned in the
standards as a common extension (I wrote the initial draft for this section in
the C89 standard).  When asked why the disconnect between what K&R said
(ref/def model) and what their compilers actually did (common model), the AT&T
representative at the time said that the ref/def model was put into K&R when
they tried to make a C compiler for their IBM mainframes, using the standard
linker, and discovered that linker would page align each common variable (CSECT
in IBM terminology IIRC).  The IBM linker is also the reason why the K&R and
the C89 standard had the rule that global names must be unique to 6 characters,
one case (which is another extension that just about everybody has and depends
on).
The default for C++ is -fno-common.
