That's correct, and that was my intention since this is apparently
how it works in Qmail.  Every time the listener's select() returns,
the FIFO is immediately close()d and the first thing the writer
does after writing it's single trigger byte is also to close() its
end of the FIFO.

Exactly.  But on 2.6, the delay between the two gettimeofday()
calls are sometimes up to 300 ms, which is 300 timeslices in
2.6, right?  I have never observed more than _one_ timeslice
delay in 2.4.

But when the listener and the writer have the same nice value,
how is it possible to have a delay of 300 ms?  Both the writer
and the listener are ready to run, so wouldn't a 300 ms delay
mean that the listener was given the CPU 300 times in a row?
