this won't happen, becouse if a program requests memory the kernel will 
through away data from the swap cache that's unchanged on disk (like the 
memory just filled by this) to free up memory for the program.
you don't want to trigger this on a program exit becouse the system is 
likly to be busy doing other things at that time, you want to try and do 
this when the system is otherwise idle.
