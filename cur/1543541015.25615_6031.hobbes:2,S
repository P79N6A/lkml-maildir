Subject: 2.4.0-test6-pre6 ff. Where has modules.dep gone?

Same .config as I've used for test5, and the same script for running the
whole compile, the modules all install in /lib/modules as they should,
but depmod silently produces an empty modules.dep
Of course no modules will load now.
Pre 6 and Pre 7.
Clues anyone?
