Results doubtful.  Consult Magic 8-Ball again :-).
I'm going to critique these individually pour encourager les autres.

Excellent!  Second sentence a good example of motivation.

Ah, now I could have written these.  What I was hoping for was extra
information analogous to what's in these:
Enable Itanium B-step specific code
CONFIG_ITANIUM_BSTEP_SPECIFIC
  Select this option to build a kernel for an Itanium prototype system
  with a B-step CPU.  You have a B-step CPU if the "revision" field in
  /proc/cpuinfo has a value in the range from 1 to 4.
Enable Itanium B0-step specific code
CONFIG_ITANIUM_B0_SPECIFIC
  Select this option to build a kernel for an Itanium prototype system
  with a B0-step CPU.  You have a B0-step CPU if the "revision" field in
  /proc/cpuinfo is 1.
Is there a value range in /proc/cpuinfo that tells you you have an A/A0 step?

These would be much improved by some indication of what IA64 variants or mask
steppings have these problems.

Good!

Excellent!
This is a fine start.
