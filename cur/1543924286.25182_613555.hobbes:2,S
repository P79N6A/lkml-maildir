I've tested both patches, and they both fix the problem. So no
worries, either way :)
As Linus said, his patch does change the behaviour. I'm not qualified
to judge how risky that is, however I think that the change is an
improvement. In fact in my original bug report I suggested the old
behaviour could be considered buggy and the new behaviour might be
preferable.
Cheers,
Duane.
