Subject: [BUG]:   problem when shutting down ppp connection since 2.5.70

Summary:
On 2.5.70 and later kernels, shutting down a pppoe connection causes 
pppd to hang and results in a usage count stuck at 1.
Details:
I have a pppoe dsl connection and I use the roaring penguin stuff that 
comes default with Mandrake 9.  My connection is brought up at init 
time.  With kernels past 2.5.69, if I try and shut down the connection I 
get logs as follows:
Jun 29 17:18:29 doug adsl-stop: Killing pppd
Jun 29 17:18:29 doug pppd[779]: Terminating on signal 15.

Also, pppd is stuck in a busy-loop, and isn't killable even with -9. 
Interestingly, top shows it in the R state.  I thought that wasn't 
supposed to happen?
With 2.5.69, the shutdown messages look like:
Jun 29 21:56:17 doug adsl-stop: Killing pppd
Jun 29 21:56:17 doug pppd[778]: Terminating on signal 15.
Jun 29 21:56:17 doug adsl-stop: Killing adsl-connect
Jun 29 21:56:17 doug pppd[778]: Connection terminated.
Jun 29 21:56:17 doug pppd[778]: Connect time 9.7 minutes.
Jun 29 21:56:17 doug pppd[778]: Sent 1510 bytes, received 588 bytes.
Jun 29 21:56:17 doug pppoe[781]: read (asyncReadFromPPP): Session 14: 
Input/output error
Jun 29 21:56:17 doug pppoe[781]: Sent PADT
Jun 29 21:56:17 doug pppd[778]: Exit.
The cpu is an athlon xp, no modules loaded.
One interesting tidbit is that this doesn't seem to happen if I remove 
the dsl connection from init and do it manually later.
I did a quick scan of the ppp*.c files in drivers/net and these are the 
ones with updates that went into 2.5.70.
Affected files are:
ppp_deflate.c 1.10
ppp_generic.c 1.25-1.30
ppp_synctty.c 1.9
Affected userids:
akpm
davem
paulus
torvalds
If anyone wants to propose a patch, I'm willing to try it out.
Thanks,
Chris
