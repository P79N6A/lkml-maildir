Hello.
I'm pleased to announce asynchronous crypto layer (acrypto) [1] release 
for 2.6.18 kernel tree. Acrypto allows to handle crypto requests 
asynchronously in hardware.
Combined patchset includes:
 * acrypto core
 * IPsec ESP4 port to acrypto
 * dm-crypt port to acrypto
 * OCF to acrypto bridge
Acrypto supports following crypto providers:
 * SW crypto provider
 * HIFN 795x adapters
 * VIA nehemiah CPU
 * SuperCrypt CE99C003B
 * devices supported by OCF
With this release of combined patchset for 2.6.18 I drop feature
extensions for 2.6.16 and 2.6.17 trees and move them into maintenance
state.
Combined patchset [190k] and drivers for various acrypto providers can 
be found on project's homepage.
