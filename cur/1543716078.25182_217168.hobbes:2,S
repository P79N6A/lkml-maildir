   Several months ago some guys from Ukrain were announcing special 
patch for kernel which allows you to save task to file, and then later 
to load it from this file.
   Saving task to disk say every 5 seconds - is some sort of 
checkpointing, so later you will be able to go back in time :-)
   You might want to check l-k archives - I cannot recall correctly the 
name of this stuff.
