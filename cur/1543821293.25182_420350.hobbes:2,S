Thanks. Merged your patch.

[PATCH] IP1000 Gigabit Ethernet device driver
This is a cleaned up fork of the IP1000A device driver:
  
http://www.icplus.com.tw/driver-pp-IP1000A.html
Open issues:
  - ipg_probe() looks really fishy and doesn't handle all errors
    (e.g. ioremap failing).
  - ipg_nic_do_ioctl() is playing games with user-space pointer
    and lets userspace do PCI access. I think we should nuke the
    ioctl. Arjan suggested ethtool ioctl instead, but we don't
    seem to have that kind of functionality now anyway.
Changelog:
  - Kill 2.2 and 2.4 compatability macros (Pekka)
  - Use proper module API (Pekka)
  - Use proper PCI API (Pekka)
  - Use netdev_priv (Pekka)
  - Consolidate headers to one file (Pekka)
  - Use __iomem annotations (Pekka)
  - Use iomap instead of read/out for I/O (Pekka)
  - Remove obfuscating register access macros (Pekka)
  - Remove changelogs (David)
  - Remove ether_crc_le() and use crc32_le() instead (David)
  - No more nonsense with root_dev. ipg_remove() now works (David)
  - Move PHY and MAC address initialization into the ipg_probe().  It was
    previously filling in the MAC address on open which breaks some user
    space. (David)
  - Folded ipg_nic_init into ipg_probe since it was broke otherwise (David)
  - Reduce delays when reading/writing the PHY registers so we clock the
    MII management interface at 2.5 MHz (the maximum according to the
    datasheet) instead of 500 Hz. (David)
The patch is 128 KB in size, so I am not including it in this
