As far as I know, Linuxthreads is maintained by Ullrich Drepper, and it
doesn't use CLONE_THREAD.  IBM's NGPT pthread library does use
CLONE_THREAD, and I'm the one who's handling kernel issues related to it.
I could code up something that does a 'kill the thread group on execve' if
you'd like me to.
