I seriously doubt that the MMX code could be faster.
The only MMX code in the original was saving some integer contents to a 
scratch MMX register rather than saving to memory. There's _no_ way that 
is faster, especially since in the kernel it would require us much extra 
work to first check that the FP context is safed. Even _without_ the extra 
work I simply cannot imagine that a "movd reg,mmx" is faster than a plain 
"movl reg,stackslot".
