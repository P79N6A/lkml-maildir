I wrote this before, but to fresh up your memory, here again, different
wording:
Unless Solaris's behavior is mandated by a commonly accepted standard,
comparable in relevance to IEEE or IETF standards, it is not relevant
for Linux.
It is YOU who has to make that decision: support your cdrtools users who
chose Linux (which means: accepting its decisions and adjusting YOUR
code to work properly, and either file detailed, traceable and
comprehensible bug reports, or work around the bugs), or leave the Linux
users standing in the rain.
