Patch applied to my 2.6.12 pending tree.  Thanks a lot Einar.
One minor comment is that there are some minor cases where
excessing in_dev get/put can be eliminated.  For example,
in __mkroute_output() we really only need to do the
in_dev_get(dev_out) once, yet we do it twice due to how
the return path of this function always puts the reference
even in the non-error case.
