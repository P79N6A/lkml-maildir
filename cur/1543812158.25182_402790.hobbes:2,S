Agreed.  However the direction I am gradually moving fs/proc/base.c
is the opposite.  Moving things out of it as much as is reasonably
possible.
I already moved out all of the /proc/<pid>/?maps code into
fs/proc/task_mmu.c
I think the more important piece of uniform practice is to put all of
the operations structures and methods together in one file so that it
is easier to look between them, when making modifications especially
since cpuset_open and proc_cpuset_show are interdependent.
