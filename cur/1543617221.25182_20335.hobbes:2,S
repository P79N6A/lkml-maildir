Or, some glorious day in the future, it came preinstalled on her hardware.

I wouldn't go THAT far, but when she does she'll have someone else upgrade it 
for her.  (Just because you CAN learn to change the oil in your car doesn't 
mean you want to.  Can aunt tillie actually unscrew her case and insert a PCI 
card?  More to the point, WOULD she?)

No.  The point is to offer EVERYBODY more and better choices.  Whether 
they'll be any use to aunt tillie specifically is secondary.

I like the auto-configurator.  I build custom kernels for all sorts of 
different machines and it can take me half an hour to walk through the menus 
with a command line open in a second window doing cat /proc/pci, cat 
/proc/bus/usb, and whatever replaced isapnp (cat /proc/bus/isapnp probably) 
to figure out and properly select everything that's in this box.
If the autoprobe saves me that half an hour, I'm all for it.  People who 
don't see much use in an autoprober probably don't work with other people's 
hardware very often.
It's also a nice educational tool for newbies learning the linux kernel, 
which I suspect is the real reason some people actively object to it. :)
