There are two things you can do here, one is easy:  use linker tricks to
make sure that an application built on alpha -- with 64-bit pointers --
uses no more than the lower 32 bits of each pointer for addressing. 
This should fix a ton of applications which cast pointer values to ints
and similar garbage.
The other option, hacking gcc to output "32-bit alpha" binary code, is a
tougher job.
I had mentioned this to Richard Henderson a while back, when I was
wondering how easy it is to implement -taso under Linux, and IIRC he
seemed to think that linker tricks were much easier.
