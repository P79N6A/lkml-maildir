Consider what happens if HZ on i386 is increased to 800 HZ for better
response. Currently HZ is seen via /proc, the times() call, and perhaps
some other places. It may be desireable to (at least initially) divide
tick values by 4 when presenting them to userspace. All of them?
Going with separate HZ values provides some flexibility. The network
tools and procps could go to 800 HZ while times() stays at 100 HZ.

Since "TSC" stands for "Time Stamp Counter", I think it fits well
enough even on non-Intel hardware. Any counter of interest for this
purpose is going to be in the CPU, though it may count at a slower
speed than the processor core is running.
Certainly this isn't a kernel or Linux feature.

One or the other will handle the problem -- see other mail.
