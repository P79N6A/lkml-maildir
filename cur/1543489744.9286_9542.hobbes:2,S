Run make -j and make sure it goes 30% into swap. That way, nearly
anything will start to skip.

PS: If you was unable to make player skip, you just did not try hard
enough. Unfortunately, unless we switch to real-time-OS with
real-time-filesystem, hellish things like make -j of kernel on 32meg
machine _will_ make sound skip.
PPS: If you have solution which really works, I'm interested. Right
now I'm running 
root@bug:~# nice -n -20 splay -t 500 -s `find /tmp/mp3.2/`
.. it behaves pretty well, but when I ran make -j on linux kernel,
machine got LAV ov 34, and took 20M of swap (on 32Meg machine), splay
just stopped playing.
