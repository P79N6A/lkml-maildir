4.  Contact FSMlabs, ask about licensing costs, compare to #3 and go with
    #4 if it makes sense.
If we were hearing about lots of companies who want to use RT/Linux
and have choosen not to do so because of the licensing, there might be
cause for concern.  I'm sure there are companies who have choosen to
skip RT/Linux once they realized it wasn't free, that's too bad, but
not the end of the world.  In the long run, it's probably good because
somebody has to emerge with a business model which will allow them to
make enough money to support the RT stuff.
