Not so.

No it does not, as pointed out by  Nick.
If there are dirty lines in the virtual cache, they _must_ be flushd long 
before the COW happens. Because if they are not, they don't show up in the 
child of the fork (which only sees it's _own_ virtual cache). See?

I just suspect it means a _buggy_ fork.
It so happens (I think), that fork is big enough that it probably flushes 
the L1 cache _anyway_. 
Does MIPS have some kind of "flush_cache_mm()" that could only flush 
user-level caches? Maybe the overhead is from flushing all dirty 
cachelines, regardless of whether they are kernel or not (and dirty kernel 
cachelines are going to be the most common by far in that path).
