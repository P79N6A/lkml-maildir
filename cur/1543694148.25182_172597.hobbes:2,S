 From arch/i386/mm/fault.c:
                /*
                 * accessing the stack below %esp is always a bug.
                 * The "+ 32" is there due to some instructions (like
                 * pusha) doing post-decrement on the stack and that
                 * doesn't show up until later..
                 */
                if (address + 32 < regs->esp)
                        goto bad_area;
