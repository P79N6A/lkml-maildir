Balderdash. You're just not "hearing" what you want to hear.
You were pointed to an answer. If all you're hearing is that Resier 4
is a prohibited subject then you're evidently incapable of following a
link or perhaps of reading. On the off chance that it is the former,
I'll quote the relevant text from the message to which Arjan pointed
you:
	"I think r4 folks are still working on Christoph's suggestions
	that include changes required for the code to be merged."
Perhaps it is that you only want to "hear" a specific answer. You've 
already written that you won't search the archives before you ask a 
question.
