No no no, it's wrong.
If you do something like this, then you also have to teach "select()" 
about this, otherwise you just get busy looping in applications.
In general, we shouldn't do this, unless somebody can show an application 
where it really matters. Taking internal kernel locking into account for 
"blockingness" easily gets quite complicated, and there is seldom any real 
point to it.
Remember: perfect is the enemy of good. I'll happily apply the patch (if 
it also updates the tty poll() functionality), _if_ there is some 
real-world situation where it matters.
