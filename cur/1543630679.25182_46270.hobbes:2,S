__STRINGIZE(KBUILD_BASENAME) sounds good, except in inline
function from header file; perhaps that's why you're adding
__FUNCTION__, which will waste a lot of space.  Suggest you
should test __INCLUDE_LEVEL__: use __STRINGIZE(KBUILD_BASENAME)
at __INCLUDE_LEVEL__ 0, __FUNCTION__ at included levels?
