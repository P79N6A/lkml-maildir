   That's my fault.  The version of the driver in the kernel atm sucks in 
   performance; I'll try to spend the day needed on the driver this week 
   and it should get up to ~800mbit from the current mess.  Getting NAPI 
   in the kernel would help... ;-)
Syskonnect sk98 with jumbo frames gets ~107MB/sec TCP bandwidth
without NAPI, there is no reason other cards cannot go full speed as
well.
NAPI is really only going to help with high packet rates not with
thinks like raw bandwidth tests.
