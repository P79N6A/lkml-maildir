Since you are using one of those Windows mailers and didn't enter a
single end-of-line character, I detect that this is probably one
of those trolls. Nevertheless, the use of floating-point is forbidden
within the kernel. Period. Because anybody who thinks they need
floating-point mathematics within the kernel is completely without
a clue, the floating-point context is not saved/restored during system
calls.
You must pair a user-mode program (usually called a daemon) with
the kernel-mode interface to your hardware (your module). This
combination will provide whatever functionality you require. The
user-mode daemon does the math and probably a lot of other things
as well.
Cheers,
