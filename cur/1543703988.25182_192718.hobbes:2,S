Some weirdness in there. This is init, for example. Apparently in R
state (as are 260-odd other processes), and:

I wonder if one of the lists is corrupt. I'd like to know _precisely_
what's at refile_inode+47 in your build. Please could you run 'gdb
vmlinux' and tell it 'disass refile_inode'. Then save the original
vmlinux somewhere, run 'make CFLAGS_inode.o=-g SUBDIRS=fs vmlinux', load
it in GDB again and repeat the disassembly, followed by 'list
*0xc0158fb7'? 
I assume this is a clean 2.4.25-pre6 build with no other patches or
modules?
