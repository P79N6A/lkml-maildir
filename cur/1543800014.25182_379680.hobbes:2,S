Ok thanks. And do you have numbers that show that the assembly
function with rep ; movsl actually  improves performance over C?  I
guess the MMIO
is uncached or at best write combined and in both cases it usually
doesn't
matter if the CPU burns a few more cycles generating the writes or not
because everything is bus bound and every cycle you save
is just lost again on the next synchronization point with the hardware.
If the assembly is not really faster I would recommend you just use a
writel()
loop in the driver instead of adding this very special purpose function
everywhere.
