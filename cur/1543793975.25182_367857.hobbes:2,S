Youch. I assumed this was all the same fs! It is the same HD though?

ACK.

I mean, no full e2fsck, at most a journal replay. This doesn't check the 
bitmaps, so if they are inconsistent, they stay inconsistent.

Yes. And you've had this problem before, even. Googling for "e2fsck 
block bitmap differences" shows me this as the third entry. :)

If you didn't get those messages, then this is not the problem, apparently.

There is a known problem with laptop mode where, often during 
spindown/spinup, the kernel emits DMA timeout errors.

According to Andrea Gelmini (the original reporter of this problem) this 
can lead to system freezes on some kernels, and corruption on others. 
Are you seeing these errors somewhere in your logs?
What's your hardware? A Thinkpad perhaps?
