It's EINTR, btw.

Ahh yes, of course. signal(2) places a syscall-restarting handler in glibc.
My bad, sorry.
For the last time:
// everything works as expected, flock returns with EINTR in the
// second instance of the program.
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/file.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <errno.h>
void alrm(int sig)
{
     write(2, "timeout\n", 8);
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
     struct itimerval tv = {
         .it_interval = {.tv_sec = 10, .tv_usec = 0},
         .it_value    = {.tv_sec = 10, .tv_usec = 0},
     };
     struct sigaction sa = { .sa_handler = alrm, .sa_flags = 0 };
     sigaction(SIGALRM, &sa, NULL);
     setitimer(ITIMER_REAL, &tv, NULL);
     int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDWR);
     if ( fd < 0 ) {
         perror(argv[1]);
         return 1;
     }
     printf("locking...\n");
     if ( flock(fd, LOCK_EX) < 0 ) {
         perror("flock");
         return 1;
     }
     printf("sleeping...\n");
     int ch;
     while ( read(0, &ch, 1) < 0 && EINTR == errno )
	 ;
     close(fd);
     return 0;
}
