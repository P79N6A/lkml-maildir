The tree is at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git - or did
you mean the logs of creating the tree.  I currently ceate the tree
fairly manually (as I slowly script what can be) and so have no logs of
that process.
The build logs that I have some control over are at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/branch/9/.
  I am hoping to expand on
the arch/config combinations over time (I have to convince my tame cross
compiler builder :-)).  I also hope that others will build this tree for
themselves and publish the results.
