Please make this use the real CONFIG_UID16_SYSCALLS instead of using a 
magic __UID16 thing that is s390x-specific. Then you make everybody who 
currently uses CONFIG_UID16 do both CONFIG_UID16 and 
CONFIG_UID16_SYSCALLS.
We don't want magic config options like __UID16 that aren't exposed as 
config options and make people go "Huh?!".
