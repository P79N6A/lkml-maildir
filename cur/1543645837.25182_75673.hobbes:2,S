Hello all,
I'm trying to get my pcmcia modem to work, it's a 
 product info: "Psion Dacom", "Gold Card Global 56K+Fax", "56K+Fax", "V8.25"
  manfid: 0x016c, 0x0005
  function: 2 (serial)
If i load the 8250_cs module, I get _nothing_ at all. No text in system logs, 
nothing. Modem doesn't respond under the old /dev/ttyS1, I've tried all other 
/dev/ttySx's to see if it hasn't been remapped. Unfortunately, no.
Is there anything else I can try? I really need my modem back...
It seems that the Config.help entry is wrong aswell.
