Hi mingo,
what kind of question is it ?
Have You seen the patch ?
It is clear that if You have 2 threads the patch give results near to the
original.
But if You have a lot of task ( hi loaded servers ) the results are _good_.
My patch avoid schedule() to scan 450 tasks ( more of them with 0 goodness )
to find the one good to run !!
More, one a great number of cases it is sufficent one test to get the good
one.
Cheers,
        Davide.
