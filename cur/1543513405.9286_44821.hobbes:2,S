   Well, it may or may not be related to the fact that I'm using a slightly
   old patched ppp.o, but someone may be still interested.
   Oct 19 13:58:56 lightside kernel: KERNEL: assertion (dst!=NULL) failed at
   tcp_output.c(96):tcp_advertise_mss 
It's just a debugging message for a condition which we've found
out to be completely legitimate.  You may safely ignore it.
Later,
