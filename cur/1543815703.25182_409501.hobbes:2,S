Okay, can you suggest a better one? That's the best I could come up 
with that wasn't long winded. :-)

What should we call it? Essentially we want to be able to get the 
physical address of a PTE in some cases, and passing struct page 
pointer seemed the best way to be able to derive that. I can rename it 
to something else vaguely plausible if the only problem is the semantic 
clash with Linux's idiomatic use of pte_page.

You mean iterate only over PTEs that are already present, or only those 
that were *not* previously present, or all (present and non-present)? 
Is that really useful? If so then yes, it's not hard to add.
