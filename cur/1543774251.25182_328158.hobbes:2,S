Doesn't help a lot. I've also been annoyed several times in the past
when having to lookup a BUG() for a kernel source I don't exactly have
at hand right then and there. If you have constructs ala
function()
{
        if (cond_a)
                BUG();
        if (cond_b)
                BUG();
        if (cond_c)
                BUG();
        do_stuff...
}
then it's impossible to know which one it is without the identical
source at hand.
That said, I don't like the reiser name-number style. If you must do
something like this, mark responsibility by using a named identifier
covering the layer in question instead.
        assert("trace_hash-89", is_hashed(foo) != 0);
or whatever.
