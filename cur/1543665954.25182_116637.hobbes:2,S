Usually I am not, but I am happy to be corrected.
Please point out the facts.
What I have seen is Paul Gortmaker, who reported on an old disk
that showed errors with 256 sector transfers. In an early post
he thought that that just was because the drive did not understand
256-sector transfers, in a later post he reported that in fact
256-sector transfers worked but that it was possible to
provoke a problem by having heavy load for an hour with
256-sector transfers.
I have an old drive that works fine but after three crashes
at 4 in the morning I decided that the load of updating
the locate database was more than it could handle.
Heavy load is something that kills many a machine.
