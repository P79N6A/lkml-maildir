So what features has Tivo removed (or threatened to remove) from the GPL
licensed parts? I think at some point they disabled the _undocumented_
skip feature in their own proprietary software, and ended up reenabling
it when a lot of customers complained. Even if those customers had the
ability to replace any GPL licensed parts, it would not have reenabled
the feature. And it was an undocumented easter egg type thing at that,
it isn't like they widely announced it in their advertising or as a
selling point.
So Google is using Linux right. What if they remove some feature? (let's
pick a randomg one, i.e. phone number lookup) Should I get a keycard for
their machine room to fix the problem, or maybe we should use some
secret sharing mechanism to prevent them from removing the feature.

So if Tivo would allow you to boot your own kernel, but keeps the
harddisk encrypted if the booted kernel does not have the right
signature? In such a case you can run your own kernel and if you replace
the harddrive you can install all the applications you might want. You
cannot however use their software, any of the recorded content or obtain
any further guide data/service updates.
And how is that any different from taking an off-the-shelf PC and
booting your own kernel with Tivo's modifications? Or really different
from the current situation.
Tivo complied in as far as they made GPL licensed code available, you
can examine it, modify it, compile it. You just can't use it _in
combination with TiVo's own software and service_. I didn't think the
GPLv2 covered anything related to use and you have retained all the
freedoms the GPL promises.

So they keep the system locked down, but include perl/python/emacs and
distribute updates in the form of scripts/source code which are either
interpreted or compiled to a ramfs filesystem at boot. Time to add
another exception?
