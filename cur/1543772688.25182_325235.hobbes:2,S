Probably, unless the wake-up of the first CPU will also wake up the
rest.

The timer reprogramming functions should be converted to use usecs. We just
currently get the time in jifies from next_timer_interrupt().

I don't know this for sure. It seemed like the safest way to go for now.

Dyntick uses next_timer_interrupt(), which is already part of the mainline
kernel. It also works with PIT + PM timer or TSC.
