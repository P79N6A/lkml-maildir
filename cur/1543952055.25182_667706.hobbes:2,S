The audit userspace tool should be fixed, no question. It can continue
to auto bind but must report the correct netlink pid.
As a workaround: Assuming that the audit daemon is the only application
to issue a AUDIT_SET command to set the status pid, the kernel can
compare the netlink source pid of the AUDIT_SET message and compare it
against the status pid provided. If they differ, issue a warning but
use the netlink source pid thus covering the case where the auto bound
netlink pid actually differs from the process pid.
