Well, there were two bigger files, the first 18 megs and the second 35 
megs and the copying never got past those two. But in the end it wasn't 
the size - I was able to make it reboot with a small C source file...

All the files are here:
http://www.holviala.com/~kimmy/crash/mount
Mount options:
/dev/md8 on /boot type ext3 (rw,nosuid,noatime)
I forgot to transfer the exports file, and now the server is dead... 
Will do that later.

I'll carry the server next to a monitor once I get back home.
