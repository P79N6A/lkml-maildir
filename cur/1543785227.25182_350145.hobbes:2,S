But even 1 Million dst cache entries would be 16+4 MB additional for a 4 cpu 
box....is that too much?  The alloc_percpu reimplementation interleaves
objects on cache lines, unlike the existing implementation which pads per-cpu
objects to cache lines...
If you are referring to embedded routing devices,
would they use CONFIG_NUMA or CONFIG_SMP?? (bigrefs nicely fold back to
regular atomic_t s on UPs)
Thanks,
