I have a 2-processor machine. Kernel 2.2.14.
As an experiment, I ran 2 setiathome-clients together with a
client from some other distributed-computing tasking. All
three of them were reniced to the lowest priority possible.
I epected to see that all 3 of them would have +/- 30%
processor usage (`top' running with a interval of 4 seconds).
Instead I got this:
  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT  LIB %CPU %MEM   TIME
COMMAND
  199 root      20  19 13588  13M   552 R N     0 42.1 10.6   2:50
setiathome
  204 root      20  19   700  700   568 R N     0 32.3  0.5   3:18
gf_client
  118 root      20  19 14100  13M   552 R N     0 24.7 11.0   5:20
setiathome
  212 root       1   0  1056 1056   868 R       0  0.4  0.8   0:01 top
  194 root       1   0  3824 3824  2808 S       0  0.1  2.9   0:00
konsole      
If it would have been something like 40% for both the
setiathome processes, and 20% for the gf_client, it would've
made sense (=> in that case, the gf_client would do relatively
more I/O calls then the setiathome-client), but this is not
clear to me. Could anyone explain this please?
Thanks.
Oh, they're not swapping or anything:
  8:06am  up 9 min,  0 users,  load average: 3.19, 2.65, 1.48
46 processes: 42 sleeping, 4 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU states:  0.1% user,  0.5% system, 99.2% nice,  0.0% idle
