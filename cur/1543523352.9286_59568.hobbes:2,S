Thanks, I will do that as soon as possible.

Cool, then maybe they'll be in 2.2.15?

Thank you, this is very comforting news!  I'll back up anyway, but it's very good to
know that the old arrays should mount.

Okay, then RAID amateurs who use any other distro (okay, perhaps SuSE and TurboLinux
have the patches...), or RAID amateurs who download the latest stock kernel.  When
2.2.15 comes out, should such amateurs be expected to know to wait for RedHat 6.2 (or
SuSE whatever)?
Thank you very much for the help, I appreciate it very much.  But I do still think
there needs to be some change in the way RAID is done in the stable kernel.  Either it
should be patched to use RAID 0.90, or there should be VERY LOUD WARNINGS in many
places, including drivers/block/Config.in, Documentation/Configure.help and
Documentation/md.txt (and in Debian, in /usr/share/doc/raidtools/DO-NOT-USE), telling
people not to expect what's there to work.
I cannot tell you how frustrated this has made me over the last three months, when
kernel after kernel just failed.  I tried different IDE options, I tried different
compilers, and each time my RAID array took more than seven hours to ckraid --fix
(which was not automatic in Debian potato until about a month ago, so the downtime was
often a lot longer), during which /home for my entire research group- including
everyone's web pages- was unavailable.  After the third or fourth failure, I went to
the debian-user mailing list, where the advice given was to just use gcc 2.7.2, which
of course did nothing for me, and I asked again and nobody had any clue.
I've been enjoying Linux for long enough on a wide enough variety of platforms- and
have had bad enough experiences with NT (really bad, hate it, hate it, hate it!)- that
switching has not been an option.  But the value of the hours and hours of lost time-
several days in total- made me *very* seriously reconsider this- this has been almost
as bad as the NT nightmares.  It probably would have even been worth the extra price
of Solaris/Sparc!
Linux can be one of two things:
  1. A professional system whose stable kernels just work.
  2. A hobbyist/geek system which requires patches to make things work, and doesn't
     even say so anywhere in the documentation, one must "just know" these things.
My impression has been that Linux aims for #1, but it seems I am wrong, or at the very
least, the RAID policy has been pure #2.  If it is about to be fixed, that's great,
but for future reference, quality control issues like this matter a whole lot to a
great many people.  I don't expect it to be perfect- we are human after all- but where
there are known problems or unmaintained sections of the kernel, please document them
far and wide.
Still disappointed, but grateful for the help!
