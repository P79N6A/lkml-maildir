But this is exactly what I expect to happen.  If you want to implement
gettimeofday() at user-level you need to modify the page.  Some of the
information the kernel has to keep for the thread group can be stored in
this place and eventually be used by some uerlevel code  executed by
jumping to 0xfffff000 or whatever the address is.
