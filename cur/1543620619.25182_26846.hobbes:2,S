gcc generally get it wrong - unreferenced strings still appear
in the object code from multiple usage patterns.  I think this
was fixed about six months ago.
But yes, the verbose BUG overhead is now six bytes per BUG, plus
a few bytes per file for the filename.  And it's my opinion that
the non-verbose BUG option is undesirable - it's making the
developers' job harder.  Seems that with this change, the reasons
for CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE are no longer with us, and it can
disappear.
