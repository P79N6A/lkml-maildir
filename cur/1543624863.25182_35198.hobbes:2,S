Ideally, you are right.  But messing around with the printk
functionality is risky and could be unpopular in the community,
especially if you are only conserving what really amounts to
a small amount of memory (16,32 or 64K, for printk ring buffer).

So I think what you want is to set a "watch" for certain events and
when those event(s) are written to the buffer (1) trigger some action, 
like halting the machine, and (2) save the last n events leading-up to 
the trigger-action.  You might also want to initiate a crash-dump and 
be able to retrieve the pinned events from the dump.
Am I on the right track ?  Can you give me some idea which information
you would watch for in the events (facility, severity, event_type,
etc.)?

Its not clear that the sort of requirement you are describing...
...In secure mode the system must be halted on overflow...
is needed by the majority of potential event logging users, so could
what you are asking for be implemented as a kernel module ?
