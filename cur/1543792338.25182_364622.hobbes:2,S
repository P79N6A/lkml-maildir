I was wondering how ppc64 ended up with different parameters in the NODE
definitions (added SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE and SD_WAKE_IDLE)	and it looks
like it was Andrew :)

It looks like balancing was not agressive enough on his workload too.
Im a bit uneasy with only ppc64 having the two flags though.
Im also considering adding balance on fork for ppc64, it seems like a
lot of people like to run stream like benchmarks and Im getting tired of
telling them to lock their threads down to cpus.
