Agreed, but the fix was worse.

We may not want to update the rtt estimate as frequently as we can as the
skew that small packets put on the rtt for small links is quite
substantial.  (See below for my idea.)

Ahhh, now I understand the motivation for the change.  Below is my
suggested fix against 2.2.11-1.  I've split the original function of
ts_recent into ts_recent and ts_paws.  ts_paws now serves as the cutoff
timestamp in order to perform PAWS, whereas ts_recent is the most recently
seen timestamp.  This change allows PAWS to be performed against pure ACK
packets now too, so PAWS is actually useful! ;-)

Security wise, I've left the window check in place for ts_recent updates,
so attacks won't be any easier.
Underestimating RTT is something I'm worried about quite a bit on the link
in question.  Since ACKs are getting through before packets, and data
packets are getting sent out of order, we've now got a factor reducing the
rtt estimate that *shouldn't* be reduced.  20 byte packets get through in
~36ms, whereas 720 byte packets are ~200ms, and 1440 byte packets take
~370ms (via ping).  This is modelled by rtt = A + B * sizeof(payload) 
almost perfectly.  Could we perhaps adopt something like this in our rtt
estimator?
