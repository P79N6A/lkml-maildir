I've recompiled my 2.6.11-rc4 kernel without ACPI sleep states, and I've
enabled lots of debugging.
Upon swsusp, I see this oops:

Otherwise, the swsusp works and resumes.
After the resume, I see these messages:

I haven't frozen the box yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if these
contribute to the conditions that cause the freeze.
Thanks.
