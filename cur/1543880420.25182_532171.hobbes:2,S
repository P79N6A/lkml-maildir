since AA defines a whitelist of files that httpd is allowed to access, a 
comprimised one may be able to mess up it's files, but it's still not going to 
be able to touch other files on the system.

this is not true. you don't need to label all object and chunks of memory, you 
just need to have a way to list (and enforce) the objects and memory that the 
program is allowed to use. labeling them is one way of doing this, but not the 
only way.
