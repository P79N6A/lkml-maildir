You are right. hard_smp_processor_id() is hard-coded to zero in case of a
non SMP kernel (include/linux/smp.h) and that's why the problem is happening.
I am booting a non-SMP capture kernel. In case of kexec on panic, we can very
well boot on a cpu whose id is not zero.
I have attached a patch with the mail which is now using
boot_cpu_physical_apicid to hard set presence of boot cpu instead of
hard_smp_processor_id(). But the interesting questoin remains why BIOS is
not reporting the boot cpu.
Thanks

o Removes the unnecessary call to local_irq_disable().
o Kdump was failing while second kernel was coming up. Check for presence
  of boot cpu apic id was failing in (apic_id_registered), hence hitting
  BUG().
o This should not have failed because before calling setup_local_APIC(), it is
  ensured that even if BIOS has not reported boot cpu, then hard set the
  prence of it. Problem happens because of usage of hard_smp_processor_id()
  which is hardcoded to zero in case of non SMP kernel. In kdump case second
  kernel can boot on a cpu whose boot cpu id is not zero. 
o Using boot_cpu_physical_apicid instead to hard set the presence of boot cpu.
