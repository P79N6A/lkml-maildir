No, as far as I can tell, it's not. You know the length of the packet, and the 
stop character is there just as a check.

Instead of this, Profibus uses an idle time of 33 bits to ensure unambiguous
detection of frame boundaries. Therefore, I'd like to be able to find out from
the hardware driver when such an idle period happens. 
Isn't this where we started off?

Note "shall be", not "may be" or "should be". Mu interpretation of that is 
that the receiver is required to detect it, yes.

There are some docs on 
http://www.profibus.com/
 but not the complete ones. You 
have to be a member, or pay for them. I took the latter route, and only have a 
hard copy.

That doesn't mean that it can't be done on Linux. If it's physically possible 
to do it with the hardware in question, then I expect Linux to be able to 
support it. My expectations of Windows, while they appear to match yours, are 
irrelevant.
