It's not so. SOME solution is easy enough. But is it right solution ?
This is unclear. To many peoples ANY solution where ANY process can
be killed is "not right" -- theonly proper solution will be one where
you'll get NULL from malloc when there are not enough memory.

Exactly.

Ideal solution will be: solution where
  1) processes will be NEVER killed.
  2) if there are not enough memory malloc just return NULL.
  3) virtual memory is used effectively (that is almost 100% of memory+swap
     can be used for "real data").
AFAIK you can more or less satisfy any two items but not all three at once...
