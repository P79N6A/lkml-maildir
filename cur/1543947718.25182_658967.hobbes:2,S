Again, sorry for the delay...it really sucks that I haven't been able
to look at this stuff closely until now. Hopefully a late review is
better than no review.

Why do you need to use the raw version?

Did you just open-code a do/while loop using goto? ;-)

Can't you just use #ifndef CONFIG_ARCH_AT91RM9200 and avoid the whole
ifdef/define/undef dance above?

Hmm. Do you really want to stop it? Won't you get better accuracy if
you let it run and program the next event as (prev_event + delta)?

I don't think you need to define this statically. You can call
request_irq() at arch_initcall() time.

I don't think it is safe to assume that one clock per channel always
means one irq per channel as well...
What's wrong with
	irq = platform_get_irq(pdev, 2);
	if (irq < 0)
		irq = platform_get_irq(pdev, 0);

Hmm...I don't like the direction this is going...
How about we make tcb_clksrc_init() global and call it from the
platform code with whatever TCB the platform thinks is appropriate?
Perhaps remove the prompt from ATMEL_TCB_CLKSRC and have the platform
select it as well? I certainly want to force this stuff on on the
AP7000...otherwise we'll just get lots of complaints that the thing is
using 4x more power than it's supposed to...
