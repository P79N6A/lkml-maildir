I assume you mean some boards describe those ports in ACPI, and some
don't?  I think the ideal solution would be to figure out how the
BIOS writers intended the device to be used, and do that.  But the
documentation may be lacking, and it degenerates into an OEM-specific
mess.  Second-best seems like a PNP quirk that pokes enough to determine
that a Super I/O device is present, and then reserves resources for
it.  Then we avoid the collision even if it87 isn't present.

That's the way PNP is supposed to work, too (more about this below).

True.  If that happens, I think we definitely need some kind of DMI-
based quirk to fix the resources.  My points are (a) the quirk needs
to be at the PNP level; it can't be in a driver, and (b) I'm lazy and
would wait until a problem happens before implementing it, because I
know so little about PNP and the specific board, and by waiting, there's
a chance I'll learn enough to avoid a mistake :-)

The overlapping device problem is a subsystem problem, not a
driver problem.  We can't solve it in the driver because we can't
depend on the it87 driver being loaded.

The general rule is that you have a PNP device with an identifier
like PNP0500 that means "16550 UART" and some resources underneath
it.  The PNP ID ("PNP0500") tells the OS which driver to bind to the
device, and the resources tell the driver where the device is.  The
serial driver in drivers/serial/8250_pnp.c is a good example of the
"normal" way PNP drivers work.
it87 doesn't fit the model very well because usually the BIOS
doesn't describe the device explicitly.  I think the expectation
is that the OS will get sensor readings some other way, such as
by evaluating ACPI "_TMP" methods, or by using some OEM-specific
ACPI device.
It's very irritating when ACPI is used to take some device that
would otherwise be nicely generic and machine-independent, and
wrap it up into some abstract device that requires an OEM-specific
driver, but I think that's what's happening here.  I suspect it
has to do with the fact that the BIOS wants to retain some
control over the device so it can deal with things like thermal
emergencies, even if the OS driver is missing or broken.

You don't see how it works because the BIOS writers have deliberately
obscured things (though no doubt they had good reasons).
