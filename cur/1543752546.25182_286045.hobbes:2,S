There is not a lot of ways to illustrate how pages are allocated
throughout an address space. If you have a better suggestion, I can update
the relevant tool.

CONFIG_4KSTACKS is not set on my system so I'm already using 8k stacks.
Based on Trond's mail, I checked my network and the MTU is 1500 bytes so I
don't think I can force high-order allocations there.
Also, while I agree this test would be important, I think it'll be way
more important when there is something in place that actually tries to
free up high-order blocks and then compare.
