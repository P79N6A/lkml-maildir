To add to this, why?
I don't mean to jump on anyone, but so long as someone can pull all the
BK data out if Larry gets unreasonable (via the active and existing SVN
or CVS gateways) who the frig cares if there's a BK clone??? If things
got nasty, pull the data and switch unceremoniously switch to SVN or
whatever.
Are there folks out there today with current SVN repos which have all
the BK metadata everyone keeps pissing on about?
