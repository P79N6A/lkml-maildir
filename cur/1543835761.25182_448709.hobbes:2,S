The point is: If you've written data with broken hardware (RAM, bus,
controllers - loads of them, CPU), what is on your disks is
untrustworthy anyways, and fsck isn't going to repair your gzip file
where every 64th bit has become a 1 or when the battery-backed write
cache threw 60 MB down the drain...
Of course, an fsck that crashes is unbearable, but that doesn't apply to
"broken hardware" failures. You need backups with a few generations to
avoid massively losing data.
