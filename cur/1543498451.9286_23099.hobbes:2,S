It's still the wrong way.
Most of the time, you don't really want to say "the disk that is target 0  
on controller 0".
You want to say "the partition that belongs on /usr", or "the new Seagate  
hd".
This suggests that you really want to have names that depend on data on  
those disks, not hardware necessary to access that data.
Compare SMB, where you have \\server\share - well, you still have "server"  
in there, but you don't even mention the path on the server, let alone  
what disk it's on.
Or Netware with NDS. You can mount a partition by a completely logical  
tree name that has no relation at all to any physical details.
And the thing is, this can be done almost completely from user space -  
just the information gathering part needs kernel support. And that means  
you can use config files.
