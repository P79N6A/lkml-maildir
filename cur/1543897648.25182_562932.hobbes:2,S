This part is wrong.
gcc supported "long long" before C99 existed.
And Joerg said the Sun cc supported "long long" before gcc did.

No, consider a pre-C99 gcc version that supports "long long".

That's a good point I missed.
What about:
#if defined(__GNUC__) && __STDC_VERSION__ < 19901L
__extension__ typedef   signed long long __s64;
__extension__ typedef unsigned long long __u64;
#else
typedef   signed long long __s64;
typedef unsigned long long __u64;
#endif
