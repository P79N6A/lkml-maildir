I do not know too much about the Linux innards, but my opinion is that 
the HID API to userland should be the bare reports. Windows is handling 
it that way for a good reason. Far too many HID devices have either 
non-informative descriptors (declaring a byte array report) or declaring 
a report which does not match the data contained. Parsing a report is 
definitely a userland job.
