It is my plan to propose (Linus is not contrary, in principle) a change of 
the poll/wake infrastructure for 2.7. There are two areas that can be 
improved. First, f_op->poll() does not allow you to send and event mask, 
and this requires the driver to indiscriminately wake up both IN and OUT 
waiters. The second area will be to give the driver to specify some "info" 
for the wake up. Something like:
wake_up_info(&wq, XXXX);
And add to the wait queue item storage for the passed info. Where "info" 
could be anything from an event mask, up to an allocated object with its 
own destructor. In this way the callback'd waked up will have the "info" 
ready w/out issuing an extra f_op->poll(). The code is pretty much 
trivial, even if changes will touch a bunch of code. The good thing is 
that migration can be gradual, beside the initial dumb compile fixing to 
suite the new f_op->poll() interface.
