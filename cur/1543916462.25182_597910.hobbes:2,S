I didn't look in 2.6.11 Kconfig files, but in 2.6.22, this driver is
limited to 3 specific boards:
config CS89x0
	tristate "CS89x0 support"
	depends on NET_PCI && (ISA || MACH_IXDP2351 || ARCH_IXDP2X01 || ARCH_PNX010X)
Does ARM S3C2400A qualify as any of those?  (MACH_... or ARCH_...)
(latter: ARCH_PNX010X is not used anywhere else AFAICT)
