I did run checkpatch.pl.  The two warnings were a false positive and
the other I let slide.  I'll make the rest of your suggested changes.

If there is already a worker thread scheduled, it will process all
the addresses on the queue, including new entries.  So all ce_setup_migrate()
needs to do is add the new entry to the queue.  The CPE interrupt can come in faster
than the worker thread can migrate the pages.  Scheduling another worker 
thread on each CPE interrupt when there is already one scheduled/running
would be overkill.

/proc seemed like a appropriate place.  Where would you suggest in sysfs?
