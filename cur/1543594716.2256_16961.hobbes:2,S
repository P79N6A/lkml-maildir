Subject: 2.2.10-pre4, error while applying the patch

Hi,
While I apply the patch pre-patch-2.2.20-4 to a clean 2.2.19 tree, I get
the following error :
patching file `drivers/scsi/sd_ioctl.c'
patching file `drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx.c'
patching file `drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_defs.h'
The next patch would create the file `drivers/sound/ad1848.c',
which already exists!  Assume -R? [n]
