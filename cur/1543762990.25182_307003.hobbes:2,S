I don't know if it matters now that we have udev.  When udev manages
the device nodes it all just works, so there's practically not much of
an issue.  The UUIDs in Software RAID and LVM make this even less of
an issue.  Besides, if they aren't using udev and are using a custom
kernel *and* using this configure option, then they're changing the
ABI on purpose for a practical benefit.
If you're saying that it's bad in principal, then that's another
story.  If that's what you mean, then it's a Linux policy issue, and
to follow convention I'd think that we'd need another major number.
That would be like the partitionable md devices, etc.
To me, the latter seems like the uglier way to go, and it would be
more permanent, while the configure option seems ugly but convenient
for this transitional stage, and could go away when high minor numbers
are well supported on the systems currently in use.
