So it is.
At kernel level nothing will stop me to halt() the cpu, if I realy want 
to. It is important to understand that tools (and all compilers are
just tools) will not enable me to write correct code.

Yes. That's absolutely true for C++. But the kernel is implemented 
in C and C is "only" kind of a high-level-assembler language. It is
ment to be open - on purpose. There exist other languages that 
have these kinds of concepts you bring in (I would not use C++ as 
the best example - take OBERON/MODULA or EIFFEL). But these 
languages are not made to implement an operating system 
(remember the reason K&R have specified and implemented C?).
What I realy dislike is the approach to bring in any OO concepts 
into the C language the linux kernel bases on. Keep the code as 
simple and homogenous as possible (or try to rewrite it in OO).
The way I see this discussion is: Every software problem has it's 
proper language to be solved in. And for this, Linus decided it to be 
C.
