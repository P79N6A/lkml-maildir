Oh absolutely.   That's the reason why 2.4 is beating 2.5 at tiobench with
more than one thread.  2.5 is alternating fairly between threads and 2.4
is not.  So 2.4 seeks less.
I've been testing this extensively on 2.5 + multipage BIO I/O and when you
increase readahead from 32 pages (two BIOs) to 64 pages (4 BIOs), 2.5 goes
from perfect to horrid - each threads grabs the disk head and performs many,
many megabytes of read before any other thread gets a share.  Net effect is
that the tiobench numbers are great, but any operation which involves
reading disk has 30 or 60 second latencies.
Interestingly, it seems specific to IDE.  SCSI behaves well.
I have tons of traces and debug code - I'll bug Jens about this in a week or
so.
