If we are talking about average case complexity (which is the only possibility
with fixed hash function and arbitrary input keys), it suffices to have
hash table size >= c*n for some constant c which gives O(1/c) cost of
all operations.

Although from asymptotic complexity standpoint hashing is much better
than B-trees, I'm not sure at all what will give the best performance for
reasonable directory sizes. Maybe the B-trees are really the better
alternative as they are updated dynamically and the costs of successive
operations are similar as opposed to hashing which is occassionally very
slow due to rehashing unless you try to rehash on-line, but I don't
know any algorithm for on-line rehashing with both inserts and deletes
which wouldn't be awfully complex and slow (speaking of multiplicative
constants, of course -- it's still O(1) per operation, but "the big Oh
is really big there").
				Have a nice fortnight
