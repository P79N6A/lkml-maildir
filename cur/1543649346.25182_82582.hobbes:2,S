10 GB pagetable overhead, for 2 GB of data.  No customer I
know would accept that much OS overhead.
To reduce the overhead we could either reclaim the page
tables and reconstruct them when needed (lots of work) or
we could share the page tables (less runtime overhead).

Actually, per-object reverse mappings are nowhere near as good
a solution as shared page tables.  At least, not from the points
of view of space consumption and the overhead of tearing down
the mappings at pageout time.
Per-object reverse mappings are better for fork+exec+exit speed,
though.
It's a tradeoff: do we care more for a linear speedup of fork(),
exec() and exit() than we care about a possibly exponential
slowdown of the pageout code ?
(note that William Irwin and myself have a trick to turn the
possible exponential slowdown of the pageout code into something
better ... just a few details left)
regards,
Rik
