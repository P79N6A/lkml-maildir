Until your attempt to get the userspace-driver work merged into the kernel
is successful (and from my reading of last month's discussion it is nowhere
near that), we should continue to maintain the present driver.
If you choose to not participate in that maintenance then others will need
to do their best in this regard.
What we should not and will not do is to permit the current driver to be
held hostage to your attempt to force a controversial and apparently
unwelcome change into the tree.
