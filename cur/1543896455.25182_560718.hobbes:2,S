this is standard dual-licensing, not special just becouse both licenses 
are GPL versions
and for people who don't like one or the other of the two licenses this 
will not be acceptable becouse it would allow someone else to take their 
work, modify it a bit, and release the result only under the license that 
they don't like
GPL+exceptions is the same thing, you are releasing it under multiple 
licenses, GPL, GPL + 1st exception, GPL + 2nd exception, GPL + 1st and 2nd 
exception, etc
one of the big problems that people don't realize is that if it takes 
GPLv3+ exception to be compatible with the apache license it's technicaly 
not legal to later strip that exception off becouse the result isn't 
compatible with the apache license, even if the GPL license says that you 
can.
after the code has passed through a couple hands it will be hard for 
someone receiving the code to know this.
I expect a lot of flamage, and bad blood, and possibly a little legal 
action between opensource projects over the next several years as people 
realize their code is being hijacked this way.
