No!  That's *exactly* the problem: you see:
	eepro100: wait_for_cmd_done timeout!
in your logs, now *which* of the 5 eepro100 cards was it?
wait_for_cmd_done(long cmd_ioaddr) should take a 'struct net_device *'
and use net_problem, then no details needed.

Yes, this should be moved up into the generic pci/networking code, but I
guess they wanted a self-contained example.

Now, which of those 5 cards was it again?

It's a direct translation from the printk ferchissakes!

Exactly.
