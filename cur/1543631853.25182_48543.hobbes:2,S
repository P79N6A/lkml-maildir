IIRC (not looking at the datasheets) there were some pretty nice
improvements made to the core in the K6 to K6-2 update (not just and
upclock and downsize, real changes(isn't this when they added MMX
too?)).
However, the K6-3 is simply a K6-2 with the addition of a 256K L2
cache on die at full cpu clock.  It was a great improvement
performance wise for many uses (think 256K L2 @ 450Mhz, and then a 2M
L3 on the mainboard) though.
