Ah, sorry. ia64 seems to be strangely different here.
My understanding is that it support NX page protection. And that you
don't have executable stacks in the ia64 ABI at all. But for i386
emulation you should be able to enable and disable executable stacks.
For some reason the needed defines are missing ...
