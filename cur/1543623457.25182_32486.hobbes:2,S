   I'm going through a switch yes; a Cisco Catalyst 4006.  I can have a chat
   with the networking folks here, but shouldn't the switch fragment the packet
   if it's too big?
Switches then would need to understand IP, IPX, Netbeui... :-)
I hear some have tried it for at least IP, and admittedly my
impression of the situation is a bit dated :)
