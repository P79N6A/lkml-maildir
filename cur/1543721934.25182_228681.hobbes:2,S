It should present you with some "hsync not supported" or something like that.

Default is '111', so you can plug your monitor to any of available outputs.
If you want exactly same videomode as you use under X, you should use
video=matroxfb:vesa:0x11A,right:48,hslen:112,left:248,hslen:112,lower:1,vslen:3,upper:48
maybe with ',sync:3' if +hsync/+vsync are mandatory for your monitor.
