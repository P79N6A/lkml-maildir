yes the Dlink DFE570-TX is a very nice card indeed.

I use those cards in all routers here and they work extremely well.
But I don't use the standard vanilla tulip driver that's in the official
kernel. I use an optimized version that handled high traffic volumes much
better, it decreases the interrupt-load quite a lot. (this driver is about
to be merged with the standard tulip driver IIRC)
I havn't had any problems with these cards so I can really recommend them.
