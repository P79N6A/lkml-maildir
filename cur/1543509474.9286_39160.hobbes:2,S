Some of the fb drivers get out of the way when the X server wants to
talk directly to the graphics hardware, correct? Then in general, that
assumption doesn't hold even when all drivers register their address
ranges.
But it might work if kernel drivers drop their MTRR allocations when
the X server takes over.
