Hello,
I am (again) playing with pipe.c trying to enlarge the
pipe buffer, so the pipe can select for write even when
non-empty (but with more than PIPE_BUF free), aiming
for reducing context switches when two applications
signal something via a pipe without waiting for
an answer. The functionality is (hopefully) OK and
I am testing the performance.
I have written two similar test programs. The
writer side selects the pipe and then writes a byte.
The reader side does either 1) blocking read of one
byte, or 2) selects the pipe for reading and then
reads a byte.
To my surprise the case 1) is slower than the original
version by 20% and there is actually more context switches.
Case 2) is at least 30% faster than the original version
and the number of context switches is dramatically reduced.
The difference probably is, that the reader is faster
than the writer and in the case 1) it nearly always
blocks in the pipe_wait call inside pipe_read.
It seems like as soon as the writer writes something
in the pipe, the reader immediately gets the CPU
instead of allowing the writer to continue.
In the case 2) it blocks in poll_wait inside pipe_poll.
I don't quite understand all the semantics behind
synchronisation primitives, but it seems like the
current code is not optimal for the concurrent
presence of reader and writer in pipe_read/pipe_write.
The code in pipe_poll excluded such possibility.
Could someone understanding these things better
take a look?
My patch and the test programs are available at
http://www.penguin.cz/~stano/code/kernelpipe.tar.gz
The patch is against 2.4.0-test4, my machine is
a SMP one (maybe the situation differs on UP).
Regards
