That has the potential of breaking other source files that don't expect
linux/types.h to bring in the whole stdint.h file.
Also, it may break some other linux header files that include <linux/types.h>
and expect to get stuff like uid_t, which you don't get if a glibc header is
included first, because of __KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES.
