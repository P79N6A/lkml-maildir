I'm looking into getting HRT and RT booting on a SUMMIT NUMA machine 
(cyclone timer), but after s/error/warning/ in arch/i386/timers/timer.c 
for the HRT cyclone ifdef, I still get the following link error:
   LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
net/built-in.o(.init.text+0xdae): In function `sock_ioctl':
net/socket.c:868: undefined reference to `__you_cannot_kmalloc_that_much'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
I was expecting to be able to build the kernel, and have it crash on 
boot (due to unsynched TSCs I'm guessing) and then start debugging/devel 
from there.  But the the rt9 patch won't build (HRT standalone for 
2.6.10 does build).  Anyone else seeing this?
