> A snippet of the Plan 9 license....
[snip]
That is, indeed, a quote from the current Plan 9 license.
You cut the paragraph a bit short though, and missed off the part that Richard Stallman argues excludes selling it for a profit, see:
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/plan-nine.html
infact, he makes a lot of valid comments on the current Plan 9 license, and concludes that it is not free software.
Whether you agree with Richard Stallman's definitions of free software and open source, is irrellevant.  I certainly am _not_ saying that I do.  The issues he raises, though, demonstrate that there are big differences between the Plan 9 license and the GPL and BSD licenses.
Don't get me wrong, I like Plan 9, but you are spreading mis-information, by continuing to imply that it is free in the same way as Linux is free.
You can find the _whole_ Plan 9 license here:

I don't argue that.  Plan 9 is open source software.  What I am saying is that the license differs from the GPL and BSD licenses in a number of ways.  Comparing it to Linux, BSD, Atheos, OpenVMS, etc, etc, is comparing Apples to Oranges.
