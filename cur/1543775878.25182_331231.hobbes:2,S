Explain how you currently allow users to annotate arbitrary files.

The situation is even better with file-as-dir.  If the administrator
wants to allow users to edit the description metadata for the file foo,
the administrator can set the appropriate permissions for
foo/.../description, and keep foo read-only.

Actually, you could use something like unionfs to allow users to keep
their own annotations without affecting everyone else's.
