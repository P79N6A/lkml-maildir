Yes, and:
        open("magicdev/.", O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY);
        open("magicdev", O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY);
will both succeed and open the same object.

OK, I'll take that as "I couldn't find a piece of code that breaks, so 
it's on to the legal issues".
SUS doesn't seem to have a lot to say about this.  The nearest thing to 
a ruling I found was "The special filename dot refers to the directory 
specified by its predecessor".  Which is not the same thing as:
   open("foo", O_RDONLY) == open ("foo/.", O_RDONLY)
I don't know about POSIX (I don't have it: a pox on standards 
organizations that don't make their standards freely available) but SUS 
doesn't seem to forbid this.
