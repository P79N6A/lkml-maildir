This test does a make -j X vmlinux on a 2.4.17 kernel compile with
a very large config set. X is 16 times the number of cpus. This is
on a 16-way NUMA-Q so we end up with a make -j256 (it's fastest
with about 1.5 * num_cpus), but this test puts more stress on the 
kernel. 
None of the other tests I ran showed anything very interesting.
(the new NUMA sched stuff from Ingo seems to give mild degredations
in -mjb ... probably needs some more tuning).
Going from 59 to 59-mm6, I get:
Kernbench-16:
                                   Elapsed        User      System         CPU
                        2.5.59       47.45      568.02      143.17     1498.17
                    2.5.59-mm6       47.18      567.15      138.62     1495.50
Summary: Scheduler stuff seems like a wash (schedule -> do_schedule). 
Seems to be some sort of rearrangement of the dcache stuff which 
appears to be mildly beneficial (what's going in there?). 
current_kernel_time seems to be less than half the cost, I'm assuming 
the new frlock kernel time stuff is doing that. This workload doesn't 
stress that very much, so I'll find a better test for that one ...
