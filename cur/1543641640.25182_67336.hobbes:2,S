Dear Linux Developers:
/proc/#/maps file of a process, which has a shared memory segment attached,
prints the segment as "(deleted)" while in fact the segment is fine and sound.
This seems to be quite confusing.
cat /proc/#/maps:
40018000-40022000 rw-s 00000000 00:05 5865476    /SYSV01315549 (deleted)
4021b000-40225000 rw-s 00000000 00:05 5898248    /SYSV012cc3bc (deleted)
ipcs -a:
0x01315549 5865476    ncbiduse  666        40960      1
0x012cc3bc 5898248    ncbiduse  666        40960      1
