found the unmap_vmas() latency: pages get queued up for TLB flush (and
subsequent freeing) and the lock-break in unmap_vmas() didnt account for
this. When there's a preemption request and we do the lock-break it's
already too late: we first have to free possibly thousands of pages,
resulting in the latency. The solution is to make the lock-break (and
hence, the queue-flush) periodically, regardless of preemption requests. 
Will release -P2 soon.
