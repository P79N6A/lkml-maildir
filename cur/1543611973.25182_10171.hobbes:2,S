    Hi Matthias :)
>Creating a dependency on Python? Is a non-issue.
    Maybe for you. For me it *is* an issue. I don't like more and
more dependencies for the kernel. I mean, if I can drop kbuild and
keep on building the kernel with the old good 'make config' I won't
worry, but otherwise I don't think that kernel building depends on
something like Python.
    Why must I install Python in order to compile the kernel? I don't
understand this. I think there are better alternatives, but kbuild
seems to be imposed any way.
>You don't make the pen yourself when writing a letter either.
    I don't like to be forced in a particular pen, that's the reason
why I use and develop for linux.

    Well, let's start writing kernel drivers with Python, Perl, PHP,
awk, etc... And, why not, C++, Ada, Modula, etc...
    The kernel should depend just on the compiler and assembler, IMHO.
