Jorg,
I am very found of all your comments and your positive attitude
on DualFS. I also understand that you have much more experience
than us in regard to GC and "cleaners". DualFS implementation is
using maybe old technology that can be definetly improved. Although
we understand the value of DualFS I don't believe we had the
intention to solve all the file systems issues but to address
some that are critical for the Linux users. We would be very
happy to improve DualFS cleaner based on your experience. So,
if you are interested we can rewrite/rearchitect the cleaner
using your ideas. After all we all want to have better FSs
for Linux and we believe that there is goodness in DualFS.
