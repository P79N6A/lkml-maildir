Subject: [PATCH] ide: motherboard-info based blacklist for ide-dma
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

We need to keep our kernel working on both legacy and modern hardware.
As it turned out, some boards don't have proper IDE DMA support for
CompactFlash (CF) adaptors, because pin connectors which relate to DMA are left
unsoldered (*).
To verify this we even bought external IDE CF adaptor which showed the same
symthoms, and then manually soldered pins that were left dangling, and voila,
DMA started to work!
Again, as they say, lots of manufacturers of not-so-new hardware did CF
soldering by the wrong way with respect to DMA, so we need a workaround.
For this __ide_dma_bad_drive function is enhance to check not only drives
blacklist but motherboards blacklist too.
Please apply before 2.6.29
(*) On IEI PCISA-C3/EDEN the kernel boots _very_ slowly, becuase we have lots
of DMA timer expiry:
    <~30s pause>
    hdc: dma_timer_epiry: dma_status == 0x21
    hdc: DMA timeout error
    ...
    hdc: DMA disabled
    ide1: dma reset
    <and the whole story repeats:>
    <~30s pause>
    hdc: dma_timer_epiry: dma_status == 0x21
    ...
Also see this posts from 2006 where they say this is usually a problem with CF
adapter not fully soldered:
