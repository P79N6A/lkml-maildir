This is guaranteed by:
    archprepare: $(SHARED_HEADERS)/user_constants.h
as everything dependent on archprepare are completed before we start
building asm-offsets.h

This is guaranteed by:
    archprepare: $(SHARED_HEADERS)/kern_constants.h
because we complete all *prepare targets before we start the actual kernel build.
But I guess you already had analysed this and therefore knew this.

Agreed.
Previously we had some race issues in the arch Makefile when they used
the prepare target and they were workaround in various ways.
This was why we introduced archprepare in the first place IIRC.
And I also recall that um was starnge but this is all cleaned up now - good.
