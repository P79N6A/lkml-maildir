Yes (especially since sys_uselib() is not _too_ time-critical), but
consider what will happen if the thread A does sys_uselib() while the
thread B runs in the affected area. It's a different problem. As for the
details - check where the new users may come from.
I don't think that it calls for ASSERT-style macros, though. IMO it's a
matter of one big grep. As of 2.3.20-pre2 affected places are
arch/mips/kernel/sysirix.c
arch/sparc64/kernel/binfmt_aout32.c
fs/binfmt_aout.c
fs/binfmt_elf.c
drivers/char/drm/bufs.c (WTF is that?)
drivers/sgi/char/{graphics.c,shmiq.c}
So there... I'm not sure that we need to protect calls in ->load_binary(),
though - it's really unnecessary.
