That's not exactly what it says.
The real text is (emphasis mine): "_IF_ the Program does not specify
a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation."
Before that it says: "Each version is given a distinguishing version
number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License
which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation"
IOW, such rules will aply if no version has been specified or 
if has the "any later version" addon. Which is not the case:
I can read "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 2, June 1991".
