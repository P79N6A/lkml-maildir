The point you're missing is that if you use a rule such as "everything using
libX* isn't swappable", then the X *server* is suddenly the prime candidate for
swapping out (as it's quite likely the biggest user of memory not using libX*).
(Anybody who ever had the OOM killer whomp their X server to free up space
fast when the *real* problem was a cluster of 6 or 8 "large but still smaller
than the X server" processes knows exactly what I mean... ;)

So you're saying that I should have kicked my laptop down to runlevel 3 just
because I went across the hall to the machine room to help get a few servers
into racks?  Or every time I go into a meeting, or get stuck on a longish phone
call?
Also, be *very* careful equating "user" with "geek" - at least some of us are
trying to produce systems that suit the needs of non-geek users....
