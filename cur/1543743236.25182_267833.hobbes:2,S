Thanks Andi. Unfortunately, I don't own an x86_64 system myself, so I
won't be able to test your code. The system I have been working on had
been made temporarily remotely accessible to me by Tyan, but working on
kernel stuff remotely on a system you don't really control isn't
convenient, as you may easily imagine. I had them reboot it manually
several times (for some reason the box wouldn't reboot by itself when
asked to).
I think I need to get my hands on an x86_64 system I could really play at
will with, as more and more Linux individuals and companies are using
these. Any Linux-oriented company wanting to support the projects I am
working on (lm_sensors [1], dmidecode [2] and linux 2.6 itself) through
the donation of an x86_64 system?
Thanks,
Jean
