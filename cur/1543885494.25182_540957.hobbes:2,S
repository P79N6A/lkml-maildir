ok, i need no other argument - fixed :-)
(btw., if anyone from the planning committee of Mankind's first mission 
to another star has any other particular wish about CFS's design, i'm 
all ears and it's going to get the highest possible priority!)
i really mean it! (And i guess you discovered my weak spot. Darn :) 
Hopefully they wont ask for STREAMS support, that would put us into a
