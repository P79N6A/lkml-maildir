Yes. (I mean, this matches my understanding)

Yes, but still I suspect wmb() is not enough. Note that try_to_wake_up()
first checks (reads) the task->state,
	if (!(old_state & state))
		goto out;
without the full mb() it is (in theory) possible that try_to_wake_up()
first reads TASK_RUNNING and only then sets CONDITION. IOW, STORE and
LOAD could be re-ordered.

Can't we introduce smp_mb_before_spinlock() (or whatever) as iirc Steven
suggested some time ago?
A bit offtopic, but let's take another example, __queue_work()->insert_work().
With some trivial modification we can move set_wq_data() outside of cwq->lock.
But according to linux's memory model we still need wmb(), which is a bit
annoying. Perhaps we can also add smp_wmb_before_spinlock(). Not sure this
is not too ugly though.
Oleg.
