Subject: [PATCH 2/2] autofs4 - check for directory re-create in lookup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew,
This problem was identified and fixed some time ago by Jeff Moyer
but it fell through the cracks somehow.
It is possible that a user space application could remove and
re-create a directory during a request. To avoid returning a
failure from lookup incorrectly when our current dentry is
unhashed we need to check if another positive, hashed dentry
matching this one exists and if so return it instead of a fail.
