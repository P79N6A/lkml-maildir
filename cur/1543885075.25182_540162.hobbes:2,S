Fair enough. But there's no way it can take into account any slab 
management structures it needs to allocate. The slab simply doesn't know 
how many pages are needed to _allocate n amount of objects_.
Peter is interested in a _rough estimate_ so I don't see the point of 
adding that kind of logic in the slab. It's an API that simply cannot 
satisfy all its callers which is why I suggested exposing buffer size in 
the first place (the slab certainly knows how many bytes it needs for 
one object).
