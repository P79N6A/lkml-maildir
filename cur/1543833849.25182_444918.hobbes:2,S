The more I think about it the more it looks like you want a nice -40 task, 
not a real-time task. The basic behaviour you want is a task which can 
wake up and get the cpu almost immediately, but if it starts to use too 
much CPU it looses that privilige. That is you want moving priorities 
just as a normal SCHED_OTHER tasks. The only difference is that you want 
it to start further up the scale than usual so it takes much longer before 
the scheduler has moved it down to a priority, where it has to compete 
with other tasks. Maybe it is already enough to run your audio application 
at nice -20 ?
When you are not developing for a specific CPU and/or the your application 
isn't the only RT application on the system, you can't use real-time
scheduling anyway, it simply doesn't make much sense. Using a very high
SCHED_OTHER priority would probably work much better. Leave the 
RT talk for the controlled embedded applications, where the developers (are 
supposed to) know and test the whole system.
I also think that Joe user who is locked into the console should only be able
to start specific applications with extraordinary priorities. That is, it
should not be enough to look at his permissions, but look at the permissions
of the program he wants to run. Therefore a suid system is the right thing to
make.
