I have this USB harddrive and a USB mp3-player, when I plug them in 
would like them to be mounted at /mnt/hd and /mnt/mp3 by auto.
Is this possible using 2.6 and some supermount-like daemon?
Also, the device I plugin first becomes /dev/sda1 and the second 
/dev/sda2 (using devfs) so I cant rely upon device names here to do 
anything. Is there any ID of the USB-device aviable somewhere that can 
be of any use?
