You still have to be able to emulate WaitForMultipleObjects() which I think is
quite difficult from userspace. It can perhaps be done with signals, but that
then incurs costs in invoking signal handlers. And however it is done, it
would require thread-safe wait queues to be implemented in userspace.
The kernel's wait queues make this a lot easier, quicker and safer.

Look carefully... It uses the atomic bit set/clear functions to modify the
state, and the wait-queue carries its own lock.
And yes, they have been SMP tested... I have a dual Pentium-II box at home. I
ran my five-thread test programs on it and they ran extremely fast without
crashing (faster than Win2000 on the same box with the same test).

What's the difference? And how do you tell that a mutex is going to be used
only between threads and not between processes? Anonymous mutexes don't
actually help - think of DuplicateHandle!
Plus it only greatly complicates your WaitFor* functions.

getname() implies MAXPATHLEN (the VFS name to kernel-space function).

Good point.

There will be... though there aren't actually all that many "kernel" object
handles... most of what are called "handles" are really just userspace object
handles issued by userspace DLL's.
However... for instance, the way I'm planning on implementing the registry
through this module is to have a cut down RPC server (using the RPC mechanism
available in that module) that gets invoked implicitly by RegOpenKey, et al.
