There's a reason that we tell all patch submitters to run "make C=1"  
on several configs before submitting patches.  Besides, you seem to  
have a vast misunderstanding of LK development processes; we frown  
heavily on people who don't "compile their code before submitting the  
patch", it's not a rare thing at all.
