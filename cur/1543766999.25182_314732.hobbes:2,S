I'm sorry, I don't get what you are saying here. Could you please
clarify?
"Membership even on the way to the dead node"? ie, you mean that the
(now dead) node hasn't acknowledged a previous membership which still
included it, because it died inbetween? Well, sure, membership is never
certain at all; it's always in transition, essentially, because we can
only detect faults some time after the fact. 
(It'd be cool if we could mandate nodes to pre-announce failures by a
couple of seconds, alas I think that's a feature you'll only find in an
OSDL requirement document, rated as "prio 1" ;-)
I also don't understand what you're saying in the second part. How are
gdlm/gfs "well glued" into the CMAN membership protocol, and what are we
looking for when we turn our squinty eyes to applications...?
