Hello Andrew,
I patched 2.4.20 with your patch found out on 
http://lwn.net/Articles/17447/
and I have a big problem with:
once server is booted on 2.4.20 with your patch, when I want to reboot
with /sbin/reboot, server makes a Segmentation fault and it crashs.
I tested it on 50-60 servers and it is the same problem. I tested kernel
2.4.20 without your patch: no problem.
# uname -a 
Linux XXXXXX 2.4.20 #1 ven déc 13 17:21:23 CET 2002 i686 unknown
# /sbin/reboot
Broadcast message from root (pts/0) Sun Dec 15 14:26:03 2002...
The system is going down for reboot NOW !!
Segmentation fault
# 
# dmRead from remote host XXXXXXXX: Connection reset by peer
It is crashed.
no logs :/
Regards
Octave
