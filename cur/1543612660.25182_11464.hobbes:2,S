So is this a deeply inherent drawback of offering readdir name orders 
that differ hugely from time of creation order?
The advantages of sorting for non-linear search time are obvious.....
I suppose we could use objectids based on the  hash of the first 
assigned filename plus a 60 bit global to the FS counter....
but it is too many bits I think.  I think that using substantially less 
than the full hash of the name that is used for directory entry keys  
doesn't work....  Comments welcome.
