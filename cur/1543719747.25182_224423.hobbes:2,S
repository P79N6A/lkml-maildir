I'm not quite sure what that means.  It was pretty easy to code a log2()
function using the built-in opcode, but it took me nearly a day to code
an exp2() function.  The built-in f2xm1 opcode helps a lot but there's
no help for the other half exp2()'s lot.
I'm sure you and other x86 assembly experts can improve on this if
you ever have any need for it.  The only consolation I get is that
for some reason gcc does library calls for log10 and pow.  It would be
really trivial to inline log10, though maybe pow is too big to benefit
from inlining.
