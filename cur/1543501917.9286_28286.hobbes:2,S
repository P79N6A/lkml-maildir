Look at the way files, filesystems and devices are handled: All structs
full of function pointers to say how the jobs are supposed to be done. That
is objects with virtual functions done in C. Also note that in some places
the kernel does things that are impossible (or close) in C++: Switch around
the virtual functions, do a new object "just like that one, but with this
little tweak", ...
Object orientation was born in the Unix kernels (at least one of the
strands was); Linux relies on that tradidion, and expands it.

The kernel shows how it is done. No keywords needed. Some readers of the
source aren't even aware of what is going on. What more transparency you
want? ;-)

That is hard to achieve whatever the language, and IMVHO one of Linus'
greatest achievements
