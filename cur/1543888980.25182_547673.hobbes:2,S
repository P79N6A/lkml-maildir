I found a bug in NCPFS that I haven't the time to fix right now.
Here's the problem: if a file contains an extended (Charcodes 128-255) 
character, especially ` (or a even worse, an word converted ' (curled 
apostrophe) NCPFS goes butter side down on the directory listing.
It doesn't hand the machine, but it does cause some serious issues on 
our network, is there a way to make NCPFS understand extended characters 
in file names?
I would appreciate this being patched.
I'll get round to it post-exams if nobody else does.
