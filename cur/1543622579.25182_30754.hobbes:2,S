This statement is not very nice. You obviously classify these architectures as minor important. At least not important enough to give them a release version as bugfree as possible at the given time. You shouldn't do that, don't focus on what you classify the "mainstream" too much. 
As stated before, there is no problem with making mistakes. You only have to handle the situation in an intelligent manner _and_ aware of the power given to you. 
In my eyes, the clean choice would have been 2.4.19 release.

Technically correct, but intentionally questionable.
