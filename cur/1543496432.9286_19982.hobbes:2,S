Because that's how the TCP checksum works.  It's very clever because it
can be written in the same fast way on little-endian and big-endian
machines, and adding 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits or even 128 bits at a
time.
May I direct you to the rfc1071 which is all about these things.  I
quote:
        "This simple checksum has a number of wonderful mathematical
        properties that may be exploited to speed its calculation, as we
        will now discuss."

That's not true on a Pentium if you pick non-conflicting addresses.
Both instructions in a pair can read from cache.
(I forget the precise rule for conflicting addresses).
