Then do it and test it :-)

Not here for sure. You must send patches to mantainer of affected program
(or appropriate mailing list). It's linux-*KERNEL* mailing list.

external command, do not pollute linux-kernel mailing list. `strings' command
is part of binutils (at least here) so you must contact with binutils guys...
