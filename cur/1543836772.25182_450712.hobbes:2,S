Does dev_driver_string() really need to be GPL-only?  Up to this point,
proprietary modules have been entitled to call dev_printk(), but now:
#define dev_printk(level, dev, format, arg...)  \
        printk(level "%s %s: " format , dev_driver_string(dev) , (dev)->bus_id , ## arg)
with
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(dev_driver_string);
means that they're not allowed to.
On a related note, one might wonder if
        return dev->driver ? dev->driver->name :
	                        (dev->bus ? dev->bus->name : "");
really qualifies for the full weight of copyright enforcement, and query
whether using it makes your driver a derived work.  Particularly since
all one is doing is asking the kernel for a nice printk prefix and know
nothing about the innards of the device model.
