well...  truncate_list_pages _does_ unlock the page.  Let's
snip some bits:

	truncate_complete_page(page);

			 */
			page_cache_release(page);
		}
	<---
	UnlockPage();		/* Remember, wait_on_page() is an indirect unlock, too */
	/*
	 * Now truncate_list_pages() drops its temporary reference.

If the page_cache_release() in truncate_complete_page() is calling
__free_pages_ok() then something really horrid has happened.
Yes, it could be that the page has had its refcount incorrectly
decremented somewhere.
Or the page wasn't in the pagecache at all.
Is this happening with the dbench/ENOSPC/1k blocksize testcase?
In that case, something is clearly going wrong with the association
of buffers against the page.  And the presence of buffers at page->buffers
_also_ contributes to page->count.  So there's a commonality here.
Possibly we forgot to increment the page count when we added buffers,
or we bogusly thought the page had buffers when it didn't, and then
dropped the page refcount when we thought we removed the buffers
which weren't really there.
