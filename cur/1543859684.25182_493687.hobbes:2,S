Ignore my final paragraph, it was clearly wrong; I was thinking about
the flush after you've written to the page.
However, I continue to assert that I require the VMA to implement
flush_anon_page() since a userspace address without knowing which
userspace it corresponds with is utterly useless for cache maintainence
purposes.
