Yes.  IBM did.  They were used it as a big arument in favor of linux on the 
mainframe instead of beowulf circa 2000 or so.  (In serious server room 
environments, you have to pay the electricity bill twice.  Once to power the 
systems and once for the air conditioning to remove the heat created by 
powering the systems... :)
