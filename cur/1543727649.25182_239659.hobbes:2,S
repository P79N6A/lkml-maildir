Perhaps I'm being completely dense, but why would the filtering tables
have to be compiled into the kernel?  Why not load them from user
space via a mechanism requiring CAP_SYS_RAWIO?
How many commands are we talking about here?  Is the mechanism
workable by a simple bitmask, or is something more complex like a
state machine required?
