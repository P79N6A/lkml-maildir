Nice, it looks like the merge of this tree, and my usb tree worked just
fine.
So, what does this now mean?  Is your kernel.org git tree now going to
be the "real" kernel tree that you will be working off of now?  Should
we crank up the nightly snapshots and emails to the -commits list?
Can I rely on the fact that these patches are now in your tree and I can
forget about them? :)
Just wondering how comfortable you feel with your git tree so far.
thanks,
