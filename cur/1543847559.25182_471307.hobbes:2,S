Looking at some BH traces*, it appears that what Dave hit is a truncate
racing with a sync...
truncate ...
  ext3_invalidate_page
    journal_invalidatepage
      journal_unmap buffer
going off at the same time as
sync ...
  journal_dirty_data
    sync_dirty_buffer
      submit_bh <-- finds unmapped buffer, boom.
I'm not sure what should be coordinating this, and I'm not sure why
we've not yet seen it on a stock kernel, but only FC6... I haven't found
anything in FC6 that looks like it may affect this.
