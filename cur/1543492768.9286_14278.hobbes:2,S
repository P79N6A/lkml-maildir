   I'm curious, Dr. von Brand; have you considered stickybit + immutable? (as
   explained in my recent treatise to Richard ;-)  It solves a lot of
   problems and gives us: 
That's actually the best alternative I've heard to date.
My objection to using setuid root as the flag is that this means that
even if you don't have root account (as Richard Gooch suggests), it
still is a problem because there are a huge number of executables that
are setuid root.  And presumably, if a setuid root executable doesn't
have a capability information, then it in effect becomes setuid root
again.  So it makes it easy for an attacker to hide a setuid root
executable in a capability system.  This is why folks would be much
happier being able to make UID == 0 have no special capabilities worth
speaking about.  
I suppose you could simply make a capibility-enabled kernel ignore the
setuid bit on setuid root executables that have no capabilities set.  It
still doesn't solve the problem which Stephen brought up which is that
you might want an executable to be setuid to some userid (such as
daemon) and yet still have capabilities.  So the stickybit + immutable
is probably the best alternative heard to date.
