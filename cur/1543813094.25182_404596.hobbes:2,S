Frankly that's something I really don't understand.  swsusp is supposed to
work (actually with 2.6.16-rc5-mm2 it works for me 100% of the time) and
if it doesn't work for you, there's a bug and it should be fixed.  Yet, you
don't report it, so it is unknown to anyone except for you and there's no
hope anyone will actually work on fixing it.

Then could you please get some data?  Also full dmesg and lsmod listing
from your system will help, as well as the output of lspci -vvv.

If you can try 2.6.16 when it's out and see how it works for you wrt
suspend/resume, that will help either.
