Subject: via-rhine nic crazyness on PIII Xeon SMP running 2.2.5 - 2.2.11

Donald and l-k members,
I have a production Oracle database running on Redhat 6.0 w/ kernel 2.2.11.  It
is an HP Kayak XU dual Pentium III Xeon w/ 256M RAM.  I have three nics in this
box: a 3c59x (eth0), a DEC Tulip (eth1), and a D-Link with the via-rhine chipset
(eth2).  All are at 100mbps.
eth0 and eth1 behave properly, but eth2 (the via-rhine) spits out "Something
Wicked has happened" into the syslog.  I turned on verbose mode and captured
about 20k of data, including three instances of the "Wickedness".  I looked
through docs and the source (via-rhine.c) and couldn't find any mention of
failure due to multiple nics or SMP.
This behaved the same way on 2.2.10 and 2.2.5(stock Redhat SMP).  I've taken
the interface down for now, so I can play with it if you need me to.  I just
can't take the machine down.
A copy of the ifconfig is located at:

A copy of the 20k of verbose output is available at:

The wickedness is towards the bottom, highlighted in red.
Can someone tell me what's going on?
