Unless I misunderstood Roman, FW_LOADER should be no longer selected.
But if the dependencies of BT_HCIBFUSB were
  depends on BT && USB && FW_LOADER
the dependency information was useless since the option itself isn't 
shown for FW_LOADER=n.
And even if the option was shown:
How should an average sysadmin configuring his own kernel know where on 
earth the FW_LOADER option is he has to enable?
