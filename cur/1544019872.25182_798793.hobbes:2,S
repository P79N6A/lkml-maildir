Ahh, you're right. That's somewhat bogus, but it does explain why we have 
those two separate merge_vma() calls.
And as you also point out:

.. and I think this is the right answer. If a device driver really does 
something as odd as play games with the offset that would make merging 
wrong, it had better set some of the VM_SPECIAL bits (presumably VM_IO) in 
order to never merge at all.
I added DaveM to the cc, since he's the one who is credited with the 
comment saying that several drivers change addr (vm_start). I only really 
see one, namely bf54x-lq043fb.c, and that one really depends on the whole 
nommu thing (ie it seems to simply require a particular virtual address, 
broken as that may be).
Btw, changing vm_start is actually very very wrong - it cannot work in 
general. Why? Because we earlier checked the "overlapping mmap" case with 
the original vm_start, an a driver that changes its vm_start in its mmap() 
routine would cause odd issues there. We also pass in "prev" to vma_link, 
so it could end up in totally the wrong place.
So changing vm_start is a sign of a driver bug, nothing less.
But there are more drivers who do change vm_pgoff, which is at least valid 
(if a bit dodgy), and is indeed a mergeability issue.  But at least a 
subset of those do already set VM_IO (eg fbmem.c - I only looked at one, 
and was happy that it already did that).
As background for Davem, here's the patch once more.
