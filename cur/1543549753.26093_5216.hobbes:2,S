(not quite as simple as that since fd 0 is valid and handle 0 is not, but
 that's a very minor issue.)
I'm still not keen on the idea, though... One of the things I'm trying to
avoid is having to maintain a large patch to the kernel. I've done it before
with the configuration manager I wrote. At the time, there was a new version
of the kernel out at least once a week, and I spent nearly all my time porting
the patch to the latest kernels.
I can see your point... though it could get very heavy on fd's. There are some
advantages to the fd approach:
  * You could use WaitFor*() on ordinary fds. It could use the internal poll
    method for non-Win32 fds.
  * The /proc/*/fd/ driver could be modified to support Win32 handles,
    probably by extending the file_operations or inode_operations struct.
  * The dentry stuff has filename support.
  * Object retension is managed by the VFS.
  * No need for kernel based fd<->handle translation.
  * You could make the Win32 objects appear in the normal UNIX VFS view of the
    world by having a new filesystem mounted somewhere appropriate.
Also some disadvantages:
  * The VFS is quite heavy on kernel memory: three layers of structure - file,
    dentry and inode. The inode structure being a bit of a monster.
  * The dentry filename support does not handle anonymous files.
  * The dentry filename support does not handle separate namespaces.
  * Can't pass initialisation data to the open routine.
  * Win32 access/share flags would have to be retained in the file struct, and
    the inode struct would have to maintain a list of these.
  * A file handle's view of the filename shouldn't get changed even if the
    file is renamed whilst open.
And some problems either way:
  * The dentry filename support does not handle wide character names or
    case-independent matching.
One other thing: the idea you put forth about looking at /proc/12345/fd/ could
be kept, but as /proc/12345/handles instead with a non-fd approach.
