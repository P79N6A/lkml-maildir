Subject: Spawning kernel threads from other kernel threads(?)

Question:
	Can you spawn a kernel thread from another kernel thread? I want to 
have one manager entity which will dynamically create kernel threads as 
needed. Right now, when I try to spawn another thread from the manager entity 
[as of today, still a kernel thread] it will crash. Is this legal? If not, what 
is the alternative? 
kernel_thread() 
Kernel Version 2.4.3
