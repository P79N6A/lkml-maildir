There is another dell2650 with 2G memory using option  "CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G":
Memory: 2075744k/2097024k available (1858k kernel code, 20408k reserved, 
704k data, 160k init, 1179520k highmem)
2097024-1858-20408-704-160=2073894.It looks be close to 2075744. So I 
consider it would be fine.
But when I use option "CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G" in these dell6650
Memory: 16116752k/16777216k available (1855k kernel code, 135136k reserved, 
702k data, 164k init, 15335296k highmem)
16777216-1855-135136-702-164=16639359.
16639359 is far from 16116752.I think "The first 800 and sum odd MB of 
memory" would be in the area (1855k kernel code, 135136k reserved, 702k 
data, 164k init, 15335296k highmem).Is this right?

The first 800 and sum odd MB of memory are not considered high memory,
so it will not appear in the output. By taking a quick look at your
numbers, it seems fine
