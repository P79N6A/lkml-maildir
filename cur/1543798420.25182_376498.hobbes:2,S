The big hole punched by DaveM is that of dependencies: a http tcp
connection is tied to ICMP or the IPSEC example given; so you need a lot
more intelligence than just what your app is knowledgeable about at its
level. 
You cant really do this shit at the socket level. You need to do it much
earlier.
At runtime, when lower memory thresholds gets crossed, you kick
classification of what packets need to be dropped using something along
the lines of statefull/connection tracking. When things get better you
undo.
