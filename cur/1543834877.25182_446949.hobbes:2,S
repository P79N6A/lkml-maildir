Hi,
no need to be sorry; it is a very valid bug, it's just something that
took some time to get fixed (and still isn't entirely done, my testbox
is busy rebooting to a next patch to fix another case).
I'm glad the patch that Linus merged about an hour or two ago fixes this
for you. Thanks for testing that!
Greetings,
   Arjan van de Ven
