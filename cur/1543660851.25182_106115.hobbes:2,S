In vesafb this is different. The video mode is set before 32bit mode is
entered, then the 32bit part of the kernel just assumes it can paint to
some memory found attached to the graphics device.
Still, for painting a bootsplash screen using fbcon, this does not
matter as all you need is the framebuffer memory.
