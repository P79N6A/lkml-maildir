Well, a USB device can't actually do DMA, so .. (it's only the USB _host_ 
that does DMA, and while those aren't always PCI, they normally are).
Basically, we only care about host devices, since anything else is going 
to be talked to through a driver and is thus not even platform-dependent 
any more. See what I'm saying? 
So we'd only have hust buses here: either PCI or ISA or something like 
that (NuBus, VME, EISA, Microchannel.. You get the idea).
And host buses - pretty much by definition - are scanned by the host. So 
all those buses tend to have host fixups. In the case of PCI, it's the 
"pcibios_xxx()" macros that are the host fixups. Most other buses tend to 
be _so_ host-centric that they don't have anything _but_ the host 
environment (ie things like the embedded buses used by ARM chips etc).

Yes, as long as you set up the "root" of the bus, and then just inherit 
the pointer, you should be ok and not need to do anything further. I 
agree.
(And btw, yes, it all booted, so PPC64 is happy again. I pushed out the 
one-liner fix).
