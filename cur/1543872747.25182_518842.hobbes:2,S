OK, I see, we are talking about two different problems...
My machine is having two problems : the one you are describing above,
which is due to a SIL controler being connected to one port of the ICH7
(at least, it seems to), and probing it goes  timeout, but nothing is
connected on it.
The second problem is a Jmicron363 controler that is failing to detect
the DVD-RW that is connected, unless I use the irqpoll option as Tejun has
suggested.
From what I remember, except my initial description of the problem,
no attempt has been made yet to workaround/understand the first problem,
and all the mails I've exchanged were focused on the second one.
But, as you suggest it, I'm adding pci=nomsi to the command line....
rebooting... no change for this part of the problem.
OK, the /proc/interrupt for this config, and the dmesg attached.

PS : I'd like to try 2.6.21-rc3, but it seems that this is breaking my
config : disk naming is no more the same, and I end up with a panic
Warning: unable to open an initial console
though i've been compiling with the same .config I was using for 2.6.21-rc2
