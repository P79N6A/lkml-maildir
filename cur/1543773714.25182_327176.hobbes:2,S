The most common issue is that your index is not in sync. For many 
operations, that's just goign to slow things down a lot (ie a diff migth 
take a long time instead of being instantaneous), but for a merge it's 
considered an error.
Does "git-diff-files -p" show any output? That's a dead give-away.
Do "git-update-cache --refresh" to make sure your index file matches your 
working directory.
I guess I can make the "git pull" script do that automatically (some other
scripts do, like "git commit", which also depends on having an up-to-date
index).
