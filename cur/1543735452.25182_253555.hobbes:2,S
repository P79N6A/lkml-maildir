Hrm... they are indeed there.  However *all* archs, including x86 and
x86_64 have HPAGE_SHIFT et al - it's used in generic code, so x86 has
the duplicate #defines as well.
Actually.. I guess the distinction is that LARGE_PAGE_* refer to the
hardware large page size, whereas HPAGE_SIZE refers to the software
page size used for hugetlbfs.  I think those are identical for all
arches at the moment, but they wouldn't have to be.
