Lots of people don't even need 3D but have to run nvidia's driver to get
multihead support, it seems this would be much easier than full 3D
implementation.

Another easy project if you have old sound cards lying around is to port
some of the old OSS drivers to ALSA (a list was posted on LKML a while
back).  This probably will take from a weekend to a few weeks.
