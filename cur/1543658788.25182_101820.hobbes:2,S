What does such tape contain ?
 - DTMF tones buried in various degrees of distortions,
   which should be decodable ?
 - DTMF tones buried in varying noises which should not be
   decodable ?
 - Other multi-tone signals which should not decode ?
For the last, I know of cases where test was done by playing a radio 
station on the decoder for 2-3 days, and seeing when does it trigger
DTMFs (if ever).
For that matter, the Linux kernel ISDN audio DTMF detection is exactly
of the last variant.
