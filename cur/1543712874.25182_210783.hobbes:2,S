This is a legitimate question.
The immediate user of this crc32c is the iscsi-sfnet driver, and my
mind-set for that is always towards gigabit-ethernet wire-rate, so
that bias may prevent me from making the right choice here.
Regarding performance vs. size, we have the BITS == 8 table for "high"
performance and bigger size, and BITS == 1 bit-wise computation, for the
least size, albeit slower performance.  Is that good enough?
The last time I wrote CRC lookup code for nibble-sized tables, it was
for an 8051 microcontroller. :-)
