Depending upon the distribution, initrd may not be unmounted.
It would normally be 'transferred' to /initrd on the new root-
filesystem when that is mounted, and just left alone. It's not
going to show up in 'df' because it got mounted before /etc/mtab
existed and `df` (most versions I've seen) reads /etc/mtab. To
fix that problem, as root do:
rm /etc/mtab
ln -s /proc/mounts /etc/mtab
That will substitute /proc/mounts, which has the real information
about what actually got mounted.

I don't normally set the link I demonstrated because the actual
drive name of my root file-system gets lost, it becomes /dev/root.
If I run lilo under this configuration, with the parameters
"root=current", I get something strange, failing to find the
root file-system upon boot.
Cheers,
