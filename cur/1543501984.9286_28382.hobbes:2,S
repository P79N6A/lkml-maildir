Hi!
I remember having read on this list that somebody
had recovered 95% of the data from a crashed ext2
filesystem when e2fsck seemed to give up.
Unfortunately, I did not keep this message. So I
would like to ask for a copy of this tool.
BTW, I experienced a huge crash on three different
partitions while producing heavy disk activity
with kernel 2.2.5-22 (RedHat). Everything started
with  'attempt to access beyond end of device'...
However, I am not yet sure of a hardware problem,
since the machine had been running without problems
for a few weeks.
Best regards,
Hermann Schichl
