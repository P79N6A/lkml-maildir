boots fine and shrinks the image size quite noticeably:
  [Nr] Name     Type        Addr     Off    Size
  [ 1] .text    PROGBITS    c0100000 001000 2771a9   [vmlinux-orig]
  [ 1] .text    PROGBITS    c0100000 001000 2742dd   [vmlinux-patched]
that's 11980 bytes off a 2585001 bytes .text, a 0.5% size reduction.
This patch we want ...
