For the Athlon 2100, I get the following outputs and then the VGA 
console is frozen from further output (but it doesn't prevent the full 
bootup into X windows session of which I am able to resume normal 
Linux/X session, but not able to regain any virtual console session.)
The virtual console (locked) shows the following outputs:
vesafb: scrolling: redraw:
mtrr: size and base must be multiples of 4kiB  (<<-- this line is 
repeated 20 times).
