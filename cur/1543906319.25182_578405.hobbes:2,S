Found it! I did the instrumentation and found pci_restore was not being 
called. Why, because this code failed:
	printk(KERN_INFO "tg3_resume: entered\n");
	if (!netif_running(dev))
		return 0;
	printk(KERN_INFO "tg3_resume: before restore\n");
Bad dmesg:

why is this, oh damn it is because I was calling openSUSE's "powersave -u" and 
not s2ram directly.  powersave is disabling the network and the tg3 will not 
restore the pci device like this! right?
here is a good dmesg with by calling s2ram:

Seams like even if powersave shuts down the network that the device should 
still work after a suspend to ram, so who is at fault here?
