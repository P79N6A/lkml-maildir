Oh well. Network connections die and real-time apps fail too.
It is important to have safe and useful behavior in the presence
of arbitrary filesystem modifications. It is very nice to be able
to use suspend/resume to alternate between two running kernels.
I wouldn't worry about locking. Write/discard all data on suspend,
then examine the inode on resume. As long as the inode doesn't
change by more than the atime, the lock can survive.
