At this point, you'll need to set the system back to its original state
that you started with, and have both "apic=debug" and "pci=routeirq" as
boot options. I'd say use the last kernel that you prepared with USB
support there (and all usual devices enabled in BIOS).

Yes, the dmesg will have all early setup information, including
interrupts setup. With pci=routeirq, all the PCI IRQ mappings should be
there, too, and you might need to include part of /var/log/messages
where USB devices get configured.
Thanks,
