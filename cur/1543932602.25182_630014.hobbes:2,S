Yeah, gives me headaches.

Ok. We tent do have quirks for those on powerpc.

Yup, possibly. On the other hand, it's also used for other things. It
normally means a fixed decode resource, such as IDE in legacy mode. If
that conflicts for real, then the only option -is- to disable the
device.
The problem on x86 seems to be to differenciate what conflicts for real
and what is just this resource management crackpot.

Heh, possibly yeah :-)

Ok. I'll keep the x86 patch out for now though. I'll let others sort out
what happens on this platform.
Cheers,
