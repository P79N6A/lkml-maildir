Why not asking the kernel to compile file, to copy file, to tar files, or
to do any kind of work. Then we can just get rid of what has been called
useland, in the past, and directly deal with user interface from the
kernel. At this step, there is no reason to distinguish the kernel from
anything else, so we can get rid of the word "kernel" with regards to
system architecture and a generic word as "crapware" will be enough to
identify the result without any ambiguity.
(Just sci-fi, I hope will never happen, but who knows ...)
