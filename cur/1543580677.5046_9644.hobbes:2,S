I'm in the process of bringing up a Novatel Merlin now (tomorrow morning 
actually). I don't know how similar it is, but they do at least use some 
common hardware on the Merlin and Sage products.

According to 
http://people.freebsd.org/~nsayer/
 you have to set the mru 
to 576 for the Merlin. There is some fairly detailed info on 
http://www.mrollins.com/newtmerlin.html
 about setting it up for (of all 
things) a Newton including all the expected commands which implies that 
you should adjust the mru setting on the card and then match that with ppp.
