Hi Linus,
The first commit after v2.6.14-rc3 in your git tree seem to refer to the same tree object
ast the v2.6.14-rc3 commit does.  Is this expected?
i.e. commits 1c9426e8a59461688bb451e006456987b198e4c0 and
69d37960b578be0a69383bd71d06c1fcfb86e8b9 both refer to tree
1041e0ea3650a74d5b1fc730cd7b697d0eed5d01.
