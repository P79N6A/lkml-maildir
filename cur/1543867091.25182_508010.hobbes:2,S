This is not a data sheet and the CPU vendors have fine tech writers
working on this already.
Also I don't really want to encourage people to hack this without
at least taking a basic look at the documentation first.

All documented in Intel documentation. But it's all relatively boring stuff
dts = debug trace store
ss = self snoop
ds_cpl = cpl qualified debug store
est = enhanced speedstep
tm2 = thermal monitor 2
ssse3 = more sse3 instructions
xtpr = tpr register chipset update control msr
