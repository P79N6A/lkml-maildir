Yes, already reported a while ago. I was having this problem with ls in
large directories where it sometimes took more than 10 seconds to scroll.
It is clearly a scheduler problem, but most people don't seem concerned
by this one since the most important to their ears is that xmms should not
skip during make -j $UINT_MAX :-/ It's a bit of a shame since other than
that, it seems stable enough for daily use on a desktop, but this problem
is too much annoying for me to definitely switch to 2.6. I wanted to give
a try to Nick's scheduler, but didn't have time yet.
Regards,
Willy
