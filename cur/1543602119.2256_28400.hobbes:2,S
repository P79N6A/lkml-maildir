Ditto here, at least as far back as 2.4.8-ac2 (nvidia driver blew up on
ac7 so I haven't tried anything more recent).
Tried to log out to reboot to 2.4.10+k7fix and logging out (X restarted)
triggered it.  (I have -got- to get to journalled root fs one of these
days.)
So you might look at 2.4.8 and 2.4.8-ac2, see whats changed.  No ext3
here, just ext2 and reiser+lvm.
(On a possibly unrelated note, 2.4.10 + k7fix works like a champ on the
iwill kk266 I've got, which was showing the athlon oops-on-boot bug.)
