This seems to be one of the small as yet unresolved problems with the newer
VM code in 2.4.16. I've not managed to prove its the VM or the differing
I/O scheduling rules however.

If it is the VM then watch for a patch from Rik for 2.4.16 + RielVM. If
that helps then we know its VM related , if not then we know to look at
other suspects
