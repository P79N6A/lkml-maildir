Not nice at all to not post updates.  They don't respond to email much either.

We are using Suse for appliance builds for customer shipments.  More stable, 
more features, better quality.  I will be using Suse for the site with Reiser 
Monday.  So far looks good.  Builds finished tonight on 2.6 and running stable.
I will post a report of any problems at the site with Reiser.  From initial tests, looks
fixed.
