NACK, binary modules are not a reason to keep broken things, rather one
to fix it better sooner than later.

yes, it would clean up the err code a lot.

Yepp.  I generally prefer to not just fix things but rip out surrounding
mess.  Keeps code maintainable in the long run.

Yes, it is.  Unrelated modules adding ioctls is a big no-way.  Even more
for binary modules.  The EMC code deserves to be broken.
