It has problems. The main problem is that trying to get the maximal
performances from the I/O subsystem I removed some harming
run_task_queue(&tq_disk) from some place and doing that I allowed an
ext2_truncate bug to see the light.
This patch will fix the bug:

The problem is that ext2_truncate wait in an infinite loop that a buffer
become unlocked, but before do that it _must_ make sure that any pending
I/O will start for real (otherwise it can loop at inifinity as it was
happening here...).

PS. I have some other thing to do now, then I'll release a fixed
2.2.6_andrea4.bz2 with some other buffer.c change included.
