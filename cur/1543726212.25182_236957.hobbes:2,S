Agreed, but I think for starters we should capture the low hanging fruit
by calling the shutdown method and then increasingly harden the
code by performing less in the kernel that panics and more in the
cleanup kernel.
That way we can concentrate first on the interfaces to the rest of the
kernel.  And then we can make the solution bullet proof.

Might not be a bad idea.
