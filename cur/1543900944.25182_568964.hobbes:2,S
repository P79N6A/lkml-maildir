This would be even worse!
Suppose you unbind (or unregister, either way) a disk driver.  It's 
unbind method will unregister the gendisk structure, thereby deleting 
all the partitions and block devices associated with the disk.  This 
will leave any and all memory mappings dangling in the breeze.  When 
the kernel resumes from hibernation, nothing will work.

Ha!  Gotcha.  You evidently haven't been reading the linux-pm mailing 
list for the last few months.  :-)
     1. post_restore isn't "existing software suspend to disk code"
	(you're supposed to call it "hibernation" now, BTW).
     2. post_restore isn't new.  It has already been proposed and
	generally accepted.  It is part of the movement to untangle
	and separate the suspend and hibernate code paths.
     3. post_restore hasn't been implemented yet.  It's barely past
	the proposal stage.
     4. Maybe _you_ like to discuss complicated issues such as this
	one without thinking, but the rest of us prefer a little 
	cerebration.

One of the topics in this discussion has been "suspend-to-both", which
includes suspend-to-RAM.  
But anyway, so what?  I wasn't talking about suspend-to-RAM; I was
talking about hibernation.

Was this request directed at me or at Rafael?  It's hard to tell.
