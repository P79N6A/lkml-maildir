Hey, I'm a retard. I don't actually do the tagging with a script, since I 
usually want to create the tree privately first, and run a final compile 
cycle on it. So I tag it by hand, and then I have a script that outputs 
a list of commands that I just cut-and-paste directly. It's ugly, but it 
works (and it means that running the script doesn't _do_ anything: I have 
to actually take one last look at what I'm going to do before I start it 
all up).
The "release script" is this piece of crap:
	#!/bin/sh
	echo "bk export -w ../linux-$2"
	echo "bk export -h -tpatch -rv$1.. > ../patch-$2"
	echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/home/torvalds/BK/tools"
	echo "changelog v$1 v$2 > ../ChangeLog-$2"
	echo "shortlog --width=72 < ../ChangeLog-$2 > ../ChangeLog"
	echo "cd .."
	echo "tar cf linux-$2.tar linux-$2"
	echo "gzip -9 patch-$2"
	echo "gzip -9 linux-$2.tar"
	echo "touch LATEST-IS-$2"
and that's it. I'd just do "../release-script 2.5.66 2.5.67" from my
kernel directory when I want to generate a 2.5.67 release.
Ok, I'm embarrassed to even admit to doing this. Don't rub it in. It's 
useful to me because sometimes I don't do a full release - I just want to 
pre-generate a change-log of the diff, for example, to judge whether I 
forgot about something.
