Hi,
There seem to be some performance issues with Ami Megaraid disk arrays
and kernel 2.2.14, copying a 100MB file results in loads of up to 7.00
and the machine stops respoding to disk access commands such as
'df' and 'ls' for about 10 seconds.  Is this a normal behaviour or is there
something wrong with my setup?
thanks in advance
Ralf
