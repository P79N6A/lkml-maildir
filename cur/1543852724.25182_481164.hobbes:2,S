That's another point against recursion - bad root can
crash the kernel... If we are about to give container's
users ability to make their own subtrees then we *must*
avoid recursion. There's an algorithm that allows one
to walk the tree like this w/o recursion.

Could you please give me a link to the patch where this
is called?
