OK, tested on my laptop.  Results:
CONFIG_TIGON3=y CONFIG_PREVENT_FIRMWARE_BUILD=y works - the firmware gets
loaded during early system boot and all is as expected.
CONFIG_TIGON3=y CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL=n wedges up - Booted with
'ignore_loglevel initcall_debug', and the last thing we get is:
tg3 0000:09:00.0: firmware: requesting tigon/tg3_tso.bin
At which point we hang because request_firmware apparently never returns.
It's wedged up *really* good at that point - I can't even use
alt-sysrq-anything.
