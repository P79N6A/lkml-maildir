Option 1)
	Use psmouse_noext option on the command line. This will
	restore the previous behavior easily and immediately.
Option 2)
	Get the Synaptics XFree86 driver for 2.5 kernels from
	
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/index.html
	This will enable additional features with the pad, like
	palm detection, multitap gestures and more. It will also
	make the pad work, of course.
