To what end? The current drivers compile and load, but they don't 
function for wireless communication! What's the point of having code 
which is essentially a no-op, why have it if it doesn't provide any 
functionality?
With the current firmware and driver a "scan" shows 14 connectible 
points outside an apartment building (only one secured in any way ;-) 
whic is just what Windows shows. With the stock kernel zero are found. 
That's not stable that's moribund.
