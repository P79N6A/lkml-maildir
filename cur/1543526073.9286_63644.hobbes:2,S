Greets, everyone.
For my own benefit, I've updated Michael Beck and David Woodhouse's PC
speaker driver to compile and work on 2.3.45. The 16 bit stereo 44khz
emulation works well, and is useful for listening to mp3's when you have
no space for a soundcard inside the machine.
The patch is downloadable from here:
