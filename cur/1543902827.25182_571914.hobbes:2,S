No, VLAN is wrong to expect the CB to survive through layers. The CB is
a private scribble area that can be used by which ever piece of code currently
"owns" the skb.  If data needs to be passed from layer to layer, it needs to
be done as separate fields in the skb itself. If A passes an skb to B, then
the CB can be changed by B (or things it calls) before it arrives at C.
