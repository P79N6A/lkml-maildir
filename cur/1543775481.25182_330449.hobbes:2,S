never when euid==root.
The pathname could even point into /proc or anything else yet unknown,
e.g. by putting some symlinks at the right places. The mere act of
opening the file as root could have unwanted side effects already.

In theory it should not be necessary. But on a practical side: we need
to provide security for daemons with elevated privileges which need to
traverse all local disks.

Correct. I have no answer to that other than: is it a real problem or
yet something else a setuid program should take into consideration?
And what info can we extract already using inotify/dnotify? There are
several ways to monitor activity and it is all information. /proc (ps)
gives information too.

But can you mount FUSE on top of a populated tree, a non-leaf dir?

including changing the ptraceability test by a signal test and including
the (IMHO) required emptyness of the mount stub?
Traversing a FUSE mountpoint is almost equivalent to talking with a
userspace program. Why should that be interesting when one simply wants
to traverse the FS? root isn't going to execute all user programs to
see what they do either.
