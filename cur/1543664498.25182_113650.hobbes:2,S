Do you have CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y?
I used to have problems with 2.5 causing hangs at X shutdown or
when the regular console screen blanker kicked in. Recently I
also got these on a new machine with 2.4.
I traced it down to CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK. It invokes the BIOS
without disabling the local APIC first. If one is unlucky, the
local APIC timer may interrupt while the machine is running in BIOS,
which typically causes a complete hang.
This is more likely to happen in 2.5 since it increased the timer
interrupt rate by a factor of 10, but it can happen in 2.4 too.
To verify, hack apic.c and ensure that "dont_enable_local_apic_timer"
is initialised to 1. Also don't enable the NMI watchdog.
Another option, which is what I use now on all my local-APIC capable
machines, is to disable APM_DISPLAY_BLANK.
I really despise BIOS writers.
