Trond,
   I've encountered at least a slight problem with your latest
(linux-2.2.10-nfsv3-0.9.11.3.dif) revision of your nfsv3 patches. It does
not appear with the stock kernel and goes back at least until your patches
were against the 2.2.9 kernel.
Thierry Davis posted this a while back :

[ST_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?AN=490858644&CONTEXT=931980918.1742798954&hitnum=0
The problem is that su causes a bus error every other time it is used.  
The only idea I have about the relation su has to nfs is in the straces
below.  I don't know where the problem begins, but I have verified it is
somewhere in your patch that breaks it.
This is completely reproducible.  This is under redhat 6.0 with the
2.2.10 kernel and the above patch (I'm not currently using the ac
patches).
It only occurs when doing an su from a user, doing an su from root (dumb I
know) works fine which makes it darn hard to do an strace on.
Nevertheless, here is where is is crashing...
This one is the "bus error" su :
mkdir("/home/staff/schrett/.xauth", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
mkdir("/home/staff/schrett/.xauth/refcount", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
mkdir("/home/staff/schrett/.xauth/refcount/root", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
mkdir("/home/staff/schrett/.xauth/refcount/root/xxxx.math.duke.edu", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
stat("/home/staff/schrett/.xauth/refcount/root/xxxx.math.duke.edu/unix:0", 0xbffff77c) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/home/staff/schrett/.xauth/refcount/root/xxxx.math.duke.edu/unix:0", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0600) = 4
fstat(4, {st_mode=0, st_size=0, ...})   = 0
ftruncate(4, 1)                         = 0
mmap(0, 2, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 4, 0) = 0x40014000
--- SIGBUS (Bus error) ---
This one is the su that works :
mkdir("/home/staff/schrett/.xauth", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
mkdir("/home/staff/schrett/.xauth/refcount", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
mkdir("/home/staff/schrett/.xauth/refcount/root", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
mkdir("/home/staff/schrett/.xauth/refcount/root/xxxx.math.duke.edu", 0700) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
stat("/home/staff/schrett/.xauth/refcount/root/xxxx.math.duke.edu/unix:0", {st_mode=0, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
open("/home/staff/schrett/.xauth/refcount/root/xxxx.math.duke.edu/unix:0", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0600) = 4
ftruncate(4, 2)                         = 0
mmap(0, 3, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 4, 0) = 0x40014000
setfsuid(0)                             = 520
time(NULL)                              = 931981413
Obviously /home/staff/schrett is an nfsv3 mounted filesystem so I suspect
the problem lies here.
Can I provide any more info to help?
