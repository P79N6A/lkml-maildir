Well ssh isn't an especially good test as it's hard to debug.
Try transferring large compressed files via netcat and comparing the
results. eg:
host1# nc -l -p 2000 > foo.bz2
host2# nc host1 2000 < foo.bz2
If the md5sums differ, follow up with a cmp -bl to see what changed.
Then we can look at the failure patterns and determine if there's some
data or alignment dependence.
