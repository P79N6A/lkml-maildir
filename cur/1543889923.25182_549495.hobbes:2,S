How much split? This time, I made four out of it.

Neither is/was CONFIG_DVB IIRC. The world does not stop turning just
because there are now extra options. If you want the functionality
of menuconfigs without introducing some variable to store their state,
well, I think that's going to be a bigger kconf patch. (Just think of
compatibility of the .config format.)
