I'm an idiot.  I mis-read your initial post thinking it was like my
ByteCC which has the dual Firewire/USB ports and since I can't get
EITHER interface type to work reliablely, I've given up on it for now.
What's the output of 'lsusb'?  You want to see what the vendor/product
ID is as a comparison.  I should check mine again under USB and see
what happens under 2.6.8, though earlier it would just hang the entire
system after copying a GB or two of data.  At least under FireWire
when it hung, I could recover the system without having to reboot.
Gah... time for more caffeine.
