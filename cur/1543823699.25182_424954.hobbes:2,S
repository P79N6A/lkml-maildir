Windows XP and 2003 support headless mode. I don't think it's particulary
difficult to do it, just implement a /dev/null graphics driver.
Oh BTW, Windows is getting their graphics subsystem out of the kernel
(except the drivers of course) in Vista. The perfect time for people
to start useless rants on whether Linux should include a graphic subsystem
in the kernel.
