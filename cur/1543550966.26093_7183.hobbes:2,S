OK.  That worked.  Thanks!  It is worth noting that the 2.4.0-test9-pre9
kernel doesn't care about the {r,w}mem_max value (I installed 2.2.16,
2.2.17, and 2.4.0-test9-pre9 on the same machine).  So I don't get
caught again later, is there different parameter that affects this
option on the 2.4.x kernel?
