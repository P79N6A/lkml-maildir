No. It's NOT exagerration, unfortunatelly. I seen quite a few times when just
mouse move was enough to bring down MS WinWord and then MS Windows. MS WinWord
is not a big problem (Ok, it WAS A PROBLEM to me, of course, but it's not an OS
problem :-) but when the whole MS Windows was killed but mouse move I was pretty
upset...
P.S. Of course sometimes (most of time in fact :-) you are lucky and do not need
reboot to accomodate mouse move and/or mouse click but sometimes... Yes, Windows
really THAT bad :-/
