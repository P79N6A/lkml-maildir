We've already reworked that question once because poeple were mucking up
the answer.  Without a lot of success.
Maybe it should be "Is this bug a regression?  If so, what was the most
recent kernel which didn't have this bug?".  But that requires that people
know what "regression" means.
Bearing in mind that many reporters aren't native English speakers, I'm
really struggling to find a simple and robust way to ask this question.
Maybe "Did any previous kernel work OK?  If so, what was the most recent
version of the kernel which didn't have this bug?"
hrm.  It doesn't matter much, really.  When people muck it up (or just
fail to answer that question) I go back and ask them again.  It only
takes 30 seconds...

Natalie is spending quite a bit of time with the bugzilla metadata,
queries, etc.  I'll shut up and let her tell us what changes we need in
this area.
