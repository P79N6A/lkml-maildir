bio_sectors is a macro which calculates nr_sectors from the bi_size
field, and as far as bi_sector is concerned, I always considered and
used as a sector (in terms of sector size) in my block-device drivers
whether the user is performing dd or anything else. And you can also
see ll_rw_blk.c in function __make_request its considering
bio->bi_sector as sector like this:
	sector_t sector;
	sector = bio->bi_sector;
	nr_sectors = bio_sectors(bio);
So, I don't think bi_sector in some case contains block_nr or
sector_nr, rather it always keeps sector_nr (CMIIW)
And __please__ change your name from Block Device to your real name,
its annoying to see Block Device as a name of a person. :(
