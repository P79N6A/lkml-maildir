IMO it's bad change. Since it will make situation slighly better in uncommon
case while slowing down common case. Since it's legal to send orphan fragments
out on the net (IP is NOT reliable anyway) it looks REALLY wrong.

This can be good change if it's possible to do without affecting speed in
normal situation (I hope it's possible to do).
