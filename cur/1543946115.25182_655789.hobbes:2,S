that is because of the inline...
static inline int early_cpu_to_node(int cpu)
{
        int *cpu_to_node_map = x86_cpu_to_node_map_early_ptr;
        if (cpu_to_node_map)
                return cpu_to_node_map[cpu];
        else if (per_cpu_offset(cpu))
                return per_cpu(x86_cpu_to_node_map, cpu);
        else
                return NUMA_NO_NODE;
}
should use per_cpu(x86_cpu_to_node_map, cpu) instead.
and limited using early_cpu_to_node etc.
