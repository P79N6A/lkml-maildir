	I was thinking older than 2-3 years.  By 'pthreads' I do mean the
glibc2 pthread.h API.

	Hrm.  For some reason I had thought that there was, for a time, a
version of linuxthreads that did it ALL in user-space, and didn't use
clone().  This would have been 3+ (or so) years ago, IIRC.  I also seem
to recall Linus talking about hoping someone would use clone (Or something
similar if I'm not remembering exactly) so that he could see if it would
work well for threading or not...
	This is digging pretty far back for me, so it's not unlikely I'm
wrong in this. :)
