Subject: Unresolved symbol compiling a standalone module?

I'm compiling a standalone kernel module outside the kernel tree.  
The compile completes fine, but when I try to insmod it, I get:
unresolved symbol printk_R1b7d4074
unresolved symbol __const_udelay_Reae3dfd6
This is very strange, because a quick grep of some of the regular,
loaded modules, like /lib/modules/2.2.19/net/eepro100.o, shows that 
they contain those exact symbols!  So why are they "unresolved" in
mine?
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS = 1, kernel is 2.2.19 + reiserfs, and I have
checked my standalone module's makefile to ensure that it uses 
_exactly_ the same gcc options as the normal kernel modules.
My /usr/include/linux directory is a symbolic link to 
/usr/src/linux/include, and /usr/src/linux is the kernel I'm running.
What am I doing wrong?
