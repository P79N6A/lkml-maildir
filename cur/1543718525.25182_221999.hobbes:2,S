what we're effectively doing is:
void foo(int a, int b, int c)
{
}
and from another compilation unit:
	foo(a, b);
and we're expecting the a's and b's to line up across all architectures and
compiler options.  I thought that on some architectures that only works out
if the function has a vararg declaration.
Does it do the right thing on stack-grows-up machines?
If the compiler passes the first few args via registers and the rest on the
stack, are we sure that it won't at some level of complexity decide to pass
_all_ the args on the stack?  It's free to do so, I think.
I have a vague memory of getting bitten by this trick once...
