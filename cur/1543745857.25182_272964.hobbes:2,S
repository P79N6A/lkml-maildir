The big question is - what does the original command look like? Just
dumping rq->cmd[0] would be a big help, but really just put code in
sg_io() in block/scsi_ioctl.c to dump the completed sg_io_hdr_t and send
that.

It's hard to know, you would have to parse every command type to verify
if the dxfer_len made sense or not. It's perfectly possible to generate
a command that would hang the drive as you describe above, only to be
aborted after it times out.
