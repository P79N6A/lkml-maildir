I've been working with a few people to reverse engineer the drivers included 
with the WAP54G 1.08.  We're about 50% done translating them back into C.  
Once we're done, we plan to study the driver in order to write our own from 
scratch, or ask someone else to cleanroom it.
However, it's likely that by the time we're done (if ever), the hardware will 
be supplanted by something else.  We've learnt the hard way that reverse 
engineering a 420K binary, and completing in a reasonable time isn't as easy 
as it sounds.  :)  This is especially true when you can't simply make 
everything public (out of copyright concerns) and do the project in a real 
open source way.
