Yes, and I'm saying that CONFIG_TINY shouldn't exist.  It should be
CONFIG_FINE_TUNE (or so), to allow anyone to fine tune the optimization
level.  Changing optimization levels is a speed / size tradeoff (if it
wasn't, there wouldn't be -O2 / -Os, they would do the same thing) which
you cannot pick a sane default for.

You're still falling into the 'embedded must mean small!' trap.  The
template should default to the well tested -O2, not the less tested
-Os.
