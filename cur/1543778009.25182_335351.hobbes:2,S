As far as I know Steve is still maintaining cifs. If you wrote him and
didn't get a response, then try again after a while (you might have
included him on CC for this mail) - maintainers don't always have time
to answer all mail in a timely fashion (or at all), and it's your
responsability to resend - that's not news.
You could also have written to the samba-technical@lists.samba.org
mailinglist (or copied it - it's listed in MAINTAINERS under "COMMON
INTERNET FILE SYSTEM (CIFS)").
[adding Stephen French to CC]
Personally I'd probably have send the mail
