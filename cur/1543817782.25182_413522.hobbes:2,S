How does this bit of code look?
if (busiest_load_per_task > this_load_per_task) {
	if (max_load - this_load > busiest_load_per_task) {
		*imbalance = busiest_load_per_task;
		return busiest;
	}
} else if (max_load - this_load >= busiest_load_per_task*2) {
	*imbalance = busiest_load_per_task;
	return busiest;
}
My maths indicate this will work even in cases when the difference 
between the two load per task values is small.  By "work" I mean that it 
will one of the high priority tasks and it won't bounce back. Do you agree?
The actual patch would be a little neater than this, of course.
