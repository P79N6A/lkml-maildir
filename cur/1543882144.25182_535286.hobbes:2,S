It's because the recent ymfpci driver tries to request_firmware() at
first.  And since no files are found, it just waits for certain time.
A workaround is to install the firmware files from alsa-firmware
1.0.14rc* package.
I'll fix the codes on 2.6.22 not to make external firmwares
mandatory via Kconfig option.
