I have no idea what remap_pte_range is trying to do here, but what it
is doing makes no sense (to me at least). 
If the pfn is not valid, we CANNOT safely call PageReserved on it - 
the *page returned from pfn_to_page is bullshit, and we crash deref'ing
it.
Perhaps this was what it was trying to do? Not sure.
