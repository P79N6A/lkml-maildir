Sometimes but often not. They tend to be below the PCI range used by the
systems but belonging to onboard "magic"

The primary/secondary ISA ports show up in PC systems because of the PCI
IDE class devices being in compatibility mode not native mode (so you
can still run old OS's). There are also a couple of older weird cases.
The PCI layer code is smart enough to figure out when a PCI and an ISA
probe find the same device and to put the entire thing together properly
so that aspect of it is ok.
For the 3rd and higher ports probing them isn't safe on a PCI box
regardless of the presence of ISA bridges so I don't think we need the
extra complexity - or am I missing something ?
