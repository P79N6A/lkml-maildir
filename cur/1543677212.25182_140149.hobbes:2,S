scsi0 : SCSI emulation for IEEE-1394 SBP-2 Devices
ieee1394: sbp2: Query logins to SBP-2 device successful
ieee1394: sbp2: Maximum concurrent logins supported: 1
ieee1394: sbp2: Number of active logins: 0
ieee1394: sbp2: Logged into SBP-2 device
ieee1394: sbp2: Node[02:1023]: Max speed [S400] - Max payload [2048]
  Vendor: FireWire  Model:  1394 Disk Drive  Rev: G603
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
SCSI device sda: 240121728 512-byte hdwr sectors (122942 MB)
sda: cache data unavailable
sda: assuming drive cache: write through
 sda: unknown partition table
devfs_mk_dir: invalid argument.<5>Attached scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
Note, the "unknown partition table" is ok for me, because I am using a
whole-disk filesystem. However, the devfs_mk_dir() error is suspicious.
Note, I use devfs. 2.5.69+bk (just before 2.6.70) things worked fine.
Now, /dev/sda is not being created. Nothing in /dev/scsi/ either, but:
hopper:~# cat /proc/scsi/sbp2/0
Host scsi0             : SBP-2 IEEE-1394 (ohci1394)
Driver version         : $Rev: 942 $ Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>
Module options         :
  max_speed            : S400
  max_sectors          : 255
  serialize_io         : no
  exclusive_login      : no
Attached devices       :
  [Channel: 00, Id: 00, Lun: 00]  Direct-Access     FireWire  1394 Disk Drive
Also, /sys/bus/scsi/devices/0:0:0:0 exists, with a block link to sda.
I suspect this is a problem where scsi_add_device() is not doing all the
stuff it needs to (does anything besides ieee1394 use scsi_add_device
and scsi_remove_device?).
