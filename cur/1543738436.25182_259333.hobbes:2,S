How strong of match requirement do we need? Note that this only
impacts distribution of binary personality modules, if you have source
there is no problem.
Several stronger solutions:
on each CVS check-in to DRM increment a count and use this for an id
manual version number for DRM
embed the kernel version
embed the kernel version plus distribution info
