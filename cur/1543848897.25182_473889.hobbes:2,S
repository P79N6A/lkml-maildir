And years later... I just got this "Invalid PBLK length [5]" error
message as well, first time ever, when first booting 2.6.18. I never
got it with 2.6.17 or any earlier kernel. My BIOS or any settings
didn't change.
Now this is a desktop so ACPI is not very important to me but is this
possibly a regression?
