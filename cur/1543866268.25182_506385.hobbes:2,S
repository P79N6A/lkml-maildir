How does this differ from a "real" bus?

Why would you need that?

That would create multiple devices on the same bus.  Is that what you
need to do?

You usually do this in your bus-specific code somehow.

No, it will walk the bus that you created.  If you need multiple busses,
create multiple 'struct bus_type' structures.

I think you will find that it works the way it is described.
Might I ask what you are trying to do with these multiple busses?
Note that you can have multiple trees of devices, all with the same
bus_type, yet not joined together in any other way.  Odds are, you
probably want to do that, right?
