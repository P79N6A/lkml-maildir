Looks so far that I am the worst off.  If I am trying to boot with
a root on a SCSI device then either a controller is misdetected,
or goes into an infinite "abort/reset" loop, or it does not initialize
properly and disks are not found.  This is a non-exclusive, logical,
"or". :-)
Booting to an IDE device makes difference only in that that if I can
boot then SCSI disks will be simply ignored.  If somebody is interested
in a collection of dmesg outputs, with DEBUG printks, from such attempts
then I am game.  Ivan was getting these pretty consistently. :-)
