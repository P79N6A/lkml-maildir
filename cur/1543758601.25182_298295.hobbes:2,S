That is asking for all sorts of trouble.

Check for errors in the NICs counters (/proc/net/dev/) in this case.
It appears it is not actually set to full-duplex, or maybe it's
10Mbps-FD.  Use ethtool to see the actual settings.
What happens if you just don't muck with the NIC and let it auto-negotiate
on it's own?
