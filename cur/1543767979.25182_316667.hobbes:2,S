Typically, the application shouldn't care. The scheduler should be
deciding where processes would be best run.

There's nothing stopping a process from parsing /dev/cpu/x/cpuid
to find out anything it wants about the layout of cores/siblings,
but I'll bet you'd be hard pressed to find a single application
that would benefit from knowing about the layout.
Processes know nothing about what the kernel has scheduled on
other threads/cores, and they shouldn't. Trying to do the same
cpu arbitration in userspace is madness.
What /could/ be useful would be a way to tell sched_setaffinity
and co "I have two threads, I'd like them both to run on different cores,
avoiding HT pairs, and never be migrated off them" without having to care
about the layout of the cpus in each application.
