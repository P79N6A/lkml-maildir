Thanks for all the pointers.
We had taken the /sbin/init from the existing Linux installation from where 
we had created the customized image. We need to have a inittab and we 
believe that we have set it correctly. The GRUB detects the CF hard disk as 
hda0 when we boot the embedded board and so in both the kernel parameter in 
grub.conf as well as in the inittab file we have / (root) marked as 
/dev/hda0. But we are perplexed by the message that the kernel prints out on 
being booted from the flash and just before panic'ing...
------------
hda: max request size: 128KiB
hda: 250368 sectors (128 MB) w/2KiB Cache, CHS=978/8/32
hda: hda1
-----------
in which it prints out hda1 instead of it printing it out as hda0
Also, the same customized image is getting successfully booted from the PC 
from where we are building this image. This panic comes out only when we 
boot this image from the CF on the embedded board.
Regards
Govind
