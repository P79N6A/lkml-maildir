Yes. I had cut off the whole nVidia install tree. The GLX driver are 
working, but only the kernel module is in /usr/src/nv eg. I change to this 
dir and type "make install" then the Makefile.kbuild for 2.6 tries to 
build it against an 2.6 kernel. Goes with all included -mm3 and others here.
LD [M]  /usr/src/nv/nvidia.o
/bin/sh: line 1: /usr/src/nv/.tmp_versions/nvidia.mod: No such file or 
directory  Building modules, stage 2.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.6.5-mm4'
nvidia.ko failed to build!
make: *** [module] Error 1
strace gives not more.
Also when I set KBUILD_EXTMOD=/usr/src/nv or to new
KBUILD_PARAMS := -C $(KERNEL_SOURCES) M=$(PWD)
in the Makefile of the nVidia source, I get this error above. Hmm.
