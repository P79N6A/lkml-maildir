I suppose you mean contiguous in physical memory?
And accessible from userspace?
> Is this possbile via alloc_bootmem_pages?
This may be impossbile [sic].
see www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/projects/vm/guide/html/understand/node37.html
also see LKML thread "Re: mapping physical memory":
"tell the kernel that you have 8MB *less* RAM than is actually present
using a "mem=" directive at boot, then grab that last piece of memory
by mmap'ing /dev/mem."
