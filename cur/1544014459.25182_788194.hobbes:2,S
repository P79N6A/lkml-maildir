No it isn't; you are still wrong.  Yet again, you are ignoring the
facts:
- zoneinfo is for offset from UTC, leap seconds are changes in UTC
- the standards say that time() returns seconds since the epoch in UTC
  _except_ explicity NOT including leap seconds
- NTP already has a way to distribute leap second information to trusted
  clients

ntpdate is obsolete.

And you are wrong.
