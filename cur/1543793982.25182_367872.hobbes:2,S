Still doesn't work. The reason is ioctl_by_bdev:
int ioctl_by_bdev(struct block_device *bdev,
                  unsigned cmd, unsigned long arg)
{
        int res;
        mm_segment_t old_fs = get_fs();
        set_fs(KERNEL_DS);
        res = blkdev_ioctl(bdev->bd_inode, NULL, cmd, arg);
        set_fs(old_fs);
        return res;
}
blkdev_ioctl is explicitly called with a NULL file pointer. That can't
work with block device drivers that use unlocked ioctls. We'd need to
create a struct file with at least a valid f_dentry->d_inode->i_bdev
chain in ioctl_by_bdev to make it work with unlocked ioctls. Not nice ..
