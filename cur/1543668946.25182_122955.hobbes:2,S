Sure it would have overhead; but it would be a general mechanism and
mean that the kernel didn't need lots of char drivers (except for boot
time things). Lots of devices are really just filters/wrappers over
other more basic devices (look at the growing pile of USB serial
device drivers).  Most char devices have such a low throughput that the
little overhead wouldn't make much difference, but would simplify the
kernel.
