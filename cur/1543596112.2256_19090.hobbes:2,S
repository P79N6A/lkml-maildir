	Does anyone know if there is any code that would break if
we put quotation marks around the $CONFIG_xxxx references in the
dep_xxx commands in all of the Config.in files?  In other words,
change all commands of the form
dep_tristate  CONFIG_FOO 'Foo on x86/pci machines'  $CONFIG_PCI $CONFIG_X86
to
dep_tristate  CONFIG_FOO 'Foo on x86/pci machines'  "$CONFIG_PCI" "$CONFIG_X86"
      Then, we could change dep_{bool,tristate} to only treat "" as "n",
in its dependency parameters without effecting how undefined variables
are treated elsewhere.  For example, CONFIG_FOO being undefined would
still cause "make oldconfig" to treat it as "NEW" and ask the user
about it.
