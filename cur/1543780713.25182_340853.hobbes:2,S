Hello Jeff,
I would like to ask what the plans/timeplan to implement NCQ support for 
NVidia NForce4(CK804) SATAII based chipsets? Fact is that is it possible 
to use NCQ with NForce4 SATAII on Windows system, I wonder why it isn't 
support by libata? Is there something in your git-tree? Or what are the 
reasons/problems behind that libata is missing NCQ support for (CK804) 
SATAII?
Greets and
Best regards
