That ** IS ** the start ... the messages came out as the 8250
driver was registering and binding to the platform device.

... so I have no idea why you think there's any dynamic addition
of new ports, or that the driver was already registered, or that
the number of ports is being changed, or any of that.

Good thing none of that is being tried, then!!

I understand working around, of course.  But I fail to see how
emitting error messages for non-error cases does anyone any good.

That doesn't seem necessary, given the simple "don't try to register
ports unless they're enabled" patch you saw.  Or desirable.

Error code 22 instead of 28, as I recall.  And as I said, the
appearance of any (bogus error) message is a "recent" change.
Two months ago, there were no messages at all.

But it was certainly wasting the memory for 63 ports.
