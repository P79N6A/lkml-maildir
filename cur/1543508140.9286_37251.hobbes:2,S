Yuck, please do not mess with the directory structure.  If you want to
find the bug in Rules.make go for it, and if you want to rename
net/econet/econet.c to net/econet/ecodriver.c (or something), that's
a decent workaround.  But there are moral and practical reasons
to leave the directory structure alone.
BTW, for anyone who cares, I have a Dancing Makefiles 2.3.15 patch now.
I haven't figured out how to handle the new ELF-init-sections-ordering
constraints though.
Michael
