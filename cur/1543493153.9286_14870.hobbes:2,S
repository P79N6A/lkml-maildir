   I don't see that this problem should be anything new. Have we ever
   been any good at lat_mmap? I don't think so..
It may be that in a previous version of lat_mmap it did only read
taps, but Larry for one reason or another changed those into writes.
Does anyone have any of the older lmbench beta's around?  Say from
about 8 to 12 months ago or so?  This would help me check my sanity.
I do agree that doing writes is probably not making the benchmark
report what the name would indicate.  However I do see that a version
that does writes is useful (think of a linker implementation that
mmap's the final object file it creates, or some mmap'd database of
some sort).  But such a benchmark should have a different name
(lat_mmapwrite, or somesuch).
