I've seen this with 'mt rewind' jamming on ide-tape. I'm
not sure of the exact pathology , but ISTR that it
was related issuing that command while the hardware was busy.
In any case the point is that a badly written driver or faulty
h/w even in a subsiduary system can cause this.
In an ideal world of course these wouldn't happen, but OTOH
is this an issue in failing a box which is going to fail
anyway if we don't kill the process. If we could ensure
a graceful failure so much the better.

     Think of the mess on the carpet. Sensible people do all their
     demon-summoning in the garage, which you can just hose down afterwards.
