Depending on where you work, "not working" may be acceptable vs.

Actually I would be happy with the stability of this series if people 
would stop trying to take working features OUT of it! That's the largest 
problem I see, not that the existing features are unstable, and we have 
a -stable branch to cover that, but that I can't count on features I use 
and which are required for useful work.
If a firm policy of not removing supported features until 2.7 was 
adopted I don't see a problem. The bulk of the instability (not 
absolutely all, I grant), is in new features, or features which aren't 
working all that well in any case. But if existing features suddenly 
drop out from beneath the user, then you will find people doing what you 
mentioned, staying with old kernels with holes rather than moving to 
kernels which are simply no longer functional.
