2.0.37+ kernels crash even before I can see the "Uncompressing linux..."
message. I use the same configuration for 2.0.36 and 2.0.37 (basically
it's the default configuration without anything interesting changed), and
the latter just won't work. It also doesn't matter if I use zImage or
bzImage. Kernel compiled with a stock redhat 4.2 (gcc 2.7.2.1). My machine
configuration is as follows:
ASUS CUBX-E MB
PIII Coppermine
512MB SDRAM
3c905-tx
guillemot tnt2 m64
ibm dtla-307030 & 305020, quantum fireball ex 6.4
