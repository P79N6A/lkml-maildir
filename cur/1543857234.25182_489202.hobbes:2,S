Subject: drivers/net/chelsio/my3126.c: inconsequent NULL checking

The Coverity checker spotted the following inconsequent NULL checking 
introduced by commit f1d3d38af75789f1b82969b83b69cab540609789:
<--  snip  -->
...
static struct cphy *my3126_phy_create(adapter_t *adapter,
                        int phy_addr, struct mdio_ops *mdio_ops)
{
        struct cphy *cphy = kzalloc(sizeof (*cphy), GFP_KERNEL);
        if (cphy)
                cphy_init(cphy, adapter, phy_addr, &my3126_ops, mdio_ops);
        INIT_WORK(&cphy->phy_update, my3216_poll, cphy);
        cphy->bmsr = 0;
        return (cphy);
}
...
<--  snip  -->
It doesn't make sense to first check whether "cphy" is NULL and 
dereference it unconditionally later.
