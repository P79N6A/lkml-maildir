If vsmp is selected, PARAVIRT will be too, and the interrupt code will
be patched.
the vsmp option triggers a select statement.
the ifdef only exists because, as I said, the code itself will be always
compiled in, to avoid an ifdef in setup_64.c. So it's just a taking it
from here, putting it there issue. Kiran seem to prefer this way, but I
don't really have a preference.
