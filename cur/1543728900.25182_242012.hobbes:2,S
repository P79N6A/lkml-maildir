Yeah, all the SD_*_INIT values are overridable. We could even say, put
in an SD_NODE2_INIT for a 2nd level NUMA domain in the generic code,
for example.
I'd say your closest-node setup would probably get close to what you want.
The main thing you want is to not do huge amounts of balancing work in
interrupt context, and also not to move a task from one side of the
system to the other when one node is a little bit out of balance.
I guess if you want to do anything fancier then we can take a look at
re-exporting the domain setup.
