Not if NEWVAL is a variable that depends on the user's selection, as
it does in my patch - unless the relevant configuration script tweaks
that file as well as creating .config which none of the existing
configuration scripts do...
With my patch, the relevant option allows the user to set any
hexadecimal digit in the range 4 through D as the replacement for the
dot in your example, but there's no simple means to reflect that value
into vmlinux.lds that I'm aware of, hence my query in this respect. I
never did see your answer to that query, so if you could repeat it,
it'd be much appreciated...
Best wishes from Riley.
