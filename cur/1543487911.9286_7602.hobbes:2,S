I still need some help with mapping buffers in kernel space
to user space. I've looked at the soundrivers, but I'm still
not clear on a couple of issues.
If I allocate memory in kernel with vmalloc, this will be locked
in RAM correct? The buffer is NOT used for DMA, so vmalloc allocated
memory should be OK.
Do I have to create a VMA structure on my own or something similar?
What are functions are involved in the remapping?
I the buffer that I want to remap is part of a network driver.
I'm still pretty clueless as you can see :-( If somebody
could please explain a few more steps that would be really
great!! 
Thanks a lot,
  Olaf
P.S. please also send an email to me, since I currently can't handle
     the high volume mailing list
