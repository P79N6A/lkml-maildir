... and has never ever worked along side the existing 8250 (or serial)
driver - therefore it can also be viewed as a long standing BUG.
We're really in this mess because it was decided that 8250 was going
to be called "serial", thereby causing everyone to believe that they
should be using the allocations for that driver. ;(
Had the allocation been called "PC 8250-based serial" in LANANA and
elsewhere, it probably wouldn't have been re-used.
