can_sleep_if(gfp_flags & __GFP_WAIT) would be better.  can_sleep_if()
is 
  do { } while(0)
for no debugging, for debugging it is
  if (unlikely(condition)) {
  	whine(__stringify(condition))
  }
One line instead of two, no references to variables when debugging is
off, automatically adds unlikely.
