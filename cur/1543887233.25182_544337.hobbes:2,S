The unregister_sysfs() removes the entry in /sys/class/net and then
decrements the reference count. When ref count goes to zero, the kobject_release
callback gets called and which does kfree(). 
Changing the shutdown order makes the /sys/class/net entry disappear
sooner. In order to prevent the free from happening until after all the dev_put()
calls have happened, the reference count for the kobject needs to be increased.
