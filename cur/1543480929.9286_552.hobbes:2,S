It can be slow-ish for generic usage though.  When a program ptrace's
another, every system call the victim program makes must go through the
tracer, which must do further system calls to access the parameters.
That's a lot of extra context switches.
I'd say that, in many (but not all!) cases, interposition at the library
level (with LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD) is faster and more convenient
than ptrace.

More generally, the module API has a generic way to hook system calls.
