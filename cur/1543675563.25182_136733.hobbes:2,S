Is this routine tested to be working?  At least passing a page
index as a full virtual address to flush_cache_page() looks suspicious.
In addition, I am not sure if the vma struct will show up in the
"shared" list _if_ the page is only mapped in one user process and
in kernel (for example, those pages you obtain through get_user_pages()
call).
I am not familiar with 2.5 kernel.  I was under impression that reverse
page mapping might provide an easy solution to this problem.
