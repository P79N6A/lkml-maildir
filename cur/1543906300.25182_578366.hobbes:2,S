See, this is exactly the problem of the SD ranters.  A ranter posts a 
problem, doesn't give reproducability hints, and neither provides technical 
detail, not even the slightest relevant stats.  And the most irritating 
part is that the code that the OP wrote (or at least its relevant parts) is 
not even available for download.
I was wondering why the OP need timers for audio playback.  What type of 
audio?  PCM, MIDI?  Once does not need timers for PCM playback but for MIDI.
SD ranters. Pure rants.
Thank you very much.
Best Regards,
Carlo
