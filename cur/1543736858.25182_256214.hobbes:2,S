Essentially the code believes that you cannot use
disable_irq() until you've requested it. You can 
however in 2.6 call request_irq with local interrupts
disabled.
We have a fundamental API design problem going back to
day one. The API IMHO should really be
	struct irq *irq;
	irq = allocate_irq(5, ...)
	enable_irq(irq);
That would fix
- Drivers failing to load/init under freak low memory situations
- How to cleanly report irqs (because each irq can now have ->name)
- How to tell which shared irq users are disabled/enabled for the irq
  poll/recovery code I posted (and is testing in -mm).
Unfortunately it would require changes to rather a lot of code.
