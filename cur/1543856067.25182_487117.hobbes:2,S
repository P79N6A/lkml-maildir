I have a machine with PCIe Hotplug capability. I am trying to run
2.6.19 and get hotplug working. It is (AMD64, Dual core, Dual
processor, CK804 south bridge). The card I am trying to hotplug is
based on Intel   82571EB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 06) )
1. loading pcieph crashes the system. So I am assuming pcie native
hotplug is not currently supported by HW/BIOS
2. Loading acpiphp.ko gives these messages. But the cards are not
visible after insertion. The (green) light does not glow. lspci does
not list the inserted cards.
[  598.126985] acpiphp: ACPI Hot Plug PCI Controller Driver version: 0.5
[  598.143390] acpiphp: Slot [6] registered
[  598.144163] acpiphp: Slot [5] registered
3. If the cards were present (i.e, cold plugging) when the system
boots up, lspci lists them. After modprobe-ing acpiphp.ko, pressing
the attention button on the card make the status light blink for 10
sec or so and stays green. Card does not power off. (even when the
corresponding ethX are down)

Googling does give one relevant link :
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-newbie@vger.kernel.org/msg06757.html
) But does not help much since even acpiphp.ko does not work.
Any pointers?
