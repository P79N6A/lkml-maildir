Hello!
The serial ports have changed their names after upgrading from 2.4.19-pre4
to 2.4.19-pre7.  What used to be /dev/ttyS0 is /dev/ttyS1 now.
This is from the kernel log:
Serial driver version 5.05c (2001-07-08) with MANY_PORTS SHARE_IRQ 
SERIAL_PCI enabled
ttyS01 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS02 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
$ ls -l /dev/tts/
total 0
crw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       4,  65 Apr 18 18:50 1
crw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       4,  66 Dec 31  1969 2
I'm using AMD K7, SMP is disabled, serial ports are enabled, ACPI is
disabled, APM is enabled, devfs is enabled and used, CONFIG_SERIAL_CONSOLE
is enabled but not currently used.  The motherboard is AOpen KT-133.  The
ports are set in BIOS to standard COM1 and COM2 settings.
I'm ready to provide more information if needed.
