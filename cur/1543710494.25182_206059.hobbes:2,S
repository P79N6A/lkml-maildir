Well, it needs to be non-silent.  Whether that is a BUG() or a badness or a
panic..

Waiting for completion of your work is one thing.  But you can't know what
else has been scheduled.  In this case RPC doesn't know that our work is
calling it.  By waiting for ALL work, it is assuming (silently) that it will
never be called from a keventd.
Either that assumption is true, in which case there needs to be a BUG and a
way out, or that assumption is false.  I'd like to believe that the
assumption is false.

Well, we did fix it in a different way.  I just wanted to bring this up as
something that warrants at least a BUG().  But a BUG() and deadlock is
almost a panic().
So if mntput() just CAN NOT be called from keventd, that is a fine answer,
but something should be written about that.  And all the other things that
can not be called from keventd.
