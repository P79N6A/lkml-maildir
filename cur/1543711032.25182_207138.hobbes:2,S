Of course, this is how I meant it.  The way things are done for now, the
class value is already a bitfield and I'm fine with that.  This makes
full sense for adapters.  What I was wondering is whether it would be
allowed to set more than one class bit for a chip driver.   Not that is
necessarily matters much, I'm just curious.  Have we ever heard of
chips that would belong to more than one class as we defined them?

Exactly what I had in mind ;)

How would we export the value though? Numerical, with user-space headers
to be included by user-space applications? Or converted to some
explicit text strings so that no headers are needed?
