Probably you're right. I should rather say it might be an error. I had 
similar error (i couldn't found log now) but it may differ a bit, and I 
also get some additional errors (I/O errors).
BTW maybe somebody have similar problem. Unfortunately it's not my machine 
so I cannot do any test other then looking at dmesg. There is kernel 
2.4.26. When my friend try to use put there his hard drive (old Segate 
8GB) it get during boot, or while trying to acces drive (depend on which 
computer he tries) 4 times CRC Error and machine complitly freeze (don't 
react on anything, no opps, no panic).
When I tried to use my Segate (3.2GB) i got lost interupt errors at boot 
time.
Both drives are ok (I've checked them).
If somebody have any idea what the problem is, I would be very grateful 
for advice. I could provide specyfic drive types later if it makes any 
sens.
