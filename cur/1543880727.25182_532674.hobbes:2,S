The troll is back I see.
Why don't you give him some useful information instead
- Turn off the paravirt option - you don't need it, and its just bloat
and slows down the kernel. Then rebuild the kernel and other bits and it
should all work fine. 
The legality of the ati driver as a derivative work is another matter,
but I don't see what _GPL symbols have to do with its legality beyond
providing a hint.
