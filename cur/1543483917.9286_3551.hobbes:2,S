Hello all
I think i've found a problem in the MEGARAID driver for HP NetRaid card.
With Kernel 2.0.36 and his patch works fine, but with kernel 2.2.1, when I do a backup with "tar" or with "dd" I get the message (after some seconds) 
"SCSI: Aborting command due to timeout: pid 53243, SCSI 2, channel 1, id 0 lun 0
 Write (8) 00 40 67 04 00"
And the system crash. The system has support for SMP with dual Pentium II. 
Can you help me, please? Thank you
