You were way wide of the mark, though admittedly Bill reacted more 
agressively than necessary, it's what happens when you use steroids to build 
up your math muscles ;-)
Bill knows what a pseudorandom generator is, and how to use it for testing 
hash functions, so do I.  I don't really like the one you showed, though I 
appeciate the fact it's a couple of assembly instructions and has a decent 
period.  Did you run a spectral test[1] on it?  I'd be surprised if the 
results are pretty, though pleasantly surprised.  I have one myself sitting 
around somewhere that's 2 or 3 instructions long, based on an LSR, which does 
have some analyzable properties.  Though for serious testing I wouldn't use 
it - I'd crack my Numerical Recipes in C or use urandom, taking it on faith 
that the coder was duly diligent.  A few cycles saved evaluating the hash 
just isn't worth it if you then have to wonder if patterns in your generator 
are showing through to your test results.
You missed a lot if you didn't notice the quality of Bill's work on the hash.
I 100% agree with his approach[2].  The fact he managed to satisfy davem 
should tell you a lot - we now have nice, short multiplicative hashes to use 
that get evaluated as fast shift-adds on sparc.  These hashes have *provably* 
good behavior.  Thanks Bill.

[2] well, I sort of put him up to it...
