Yeah, but it was also obvious that my_module_init() can fail this way. 
Look, first we watch the module initialization, that is, we run the 
critical stuff like resource allocation, data structure allocation, etc. 
If we fail here, we can't load the module, because it would be unoperative 
if we proceed. (Because the data simply isn't there.)
And possibly Rusty wanted to avoid a certain race, which is unrelated to
school and kids. Once we've initialized, the module can be used, earlier
is balderdash.
