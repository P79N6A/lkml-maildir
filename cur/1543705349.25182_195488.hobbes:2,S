That's another problem. showkey -s will show nothing if the keys don't
work in 2.6, and nothing useful for setkeycodes usage if they do.
I'm planning to add a new event type to report the raw scancodes through
the event interface, though I'm still yet not decided about how exactly
to do it and whether to use this to do real raw mode instead of the
simulated one where possible. I don't think the later is a good idea.

Even for scancodes? Well, in that case I'll have to keep the kludge as
it is. Or have setkeycodes use EVIOCSKEYCODE.
