That dependency for each driver exists solely for menu display purposes. 
  There is no code dependency.

The only operational difference between CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=y and 
CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=m is that CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=m restricts the drivers from 
being compiled in -- a silly and needless restriction.
The elimination of 'y' as an option should propagate from CONFIG_SCSI.

Agreed this is a _theoretical_ problem.
Never heard of this being an issue in the real world, because the IDE 
driver locks up on a lot of the Intel hardware in question.  That was 
one of the original reason for the split PATA/SATA driver configuration, 
for this wonky combined mode.

No preference whether its hidden or greyed out.
CONFIG_SCSI_SATA is just a switch to enable listing a set of drivers, 
just like CONFIG_NET_PCI (which I note is a bool), CONFIG_NET_ISA (a 
bool), ...

If IDE is compiled in, IDE SATA option is not enabled, and ata_piix or 
ahci are used.
Do we really want to do
	#if defined (CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC) &&
	       !defined(CONFIG_IDE_BLK_DEV_SATA) &&
	    (
	       defined(CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_PIIX) ||
	       defined(CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_PIIX_MODULE) ||
	       defined(CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_AHCI ||
	       defined(CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_AHCI_MODULE)
	    )
?
At that point it seems easier to solve at the Kconfig level, perhaps 
defining CONFIG_SATA_INTEL_COMBINED at the end.  And then with the quirk 
issue out of the way, CONFIG_SCSI_SATA becomes purely a boolean 
enable/disable-this-menu switch.
