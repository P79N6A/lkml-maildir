No, it isn't, the fact that a module is GPL'd or BSD'd means that the
source is available, which means that any available kernel hacker can debug
it.  Proprietary/binary-only modules won't have such a license, the source
isn't accessible, and can't be debugged by the general hacking community.
You've been reading waaaay too much into this.

Obviously that's not enough if the tainted mechanism is needed to "dismiss"
those posts.  And how does printing the use of active modules help
determine which modules are supported and which aren't?  You'd still need
to label those modules as being proprietary and such, so you still end up
with the tainted mechanism.

Two things.  Bitching about code that you don't agree with without
providing a suitable alternative won't really get you anywhere.  The
tainted inteface is needed to sway or halt the onslaught of bug reports for
unsupported modules.  You do realize that the kernel community can't
support modules without source?  Also, it's up to the copyright holder of a
piece of code what strings are in their code, as long as it's accepted by
whomever who cares if it contains "I'd like to give a shout out...".
