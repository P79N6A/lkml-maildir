  Hi *,
Is there any documentation on how the new 2.5 ipsec plays together with
itables?  How do ipsec packets traverse the tables?  Where is the
encryption/decryption of the packets done?  In transport mode?  In
tunnel mode?
The freeswan documentation is quite clear about this:  For example
incoming packets:  The paket filters see the packets twice:  Once from
the physical device (eth0, ppp0, whatever), with data still encrypted
and protocol 50/51, and once from the attached virtual ipsec<n> device,
after decryption in cleartext (so iptables actually sees what tcp/udp
port it is addressed to, ...).
How does the new ipsec code work compared to that?  Probably different
as there is no virtual ipsec<n> device any more, but how exactly?
  Gerd
