Do you need to even do that if CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is unset?
Something like:
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
                /*
                 * Need to access the cpu field knowing that
                 * DEBUG_PAGEALLOC could have unmapped it if
                 * the mutex owner just released it and exited.
                 */
                if (probe_kernel_address(&thread->cpu, cpu))
                        break;
#else
		cpu = thread->cpu;
#endif
