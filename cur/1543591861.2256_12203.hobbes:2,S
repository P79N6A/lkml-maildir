I'm a little skeptical about the necessity of these per-fd effects in the
first place - after all, Plan 9 does without them.  There's only one
floppy drive, yes? No concurrent users of serial ports? The counter that
comes to mind is sound devices supporting multiple opens, but I think
esound and friends are a better solution to that problem.
What I'd like to see:
- An interface for registering an array of related devices (almost always
two: raw and ctl) and their legacy device numbers with a single userspace
callout that does whatever /dev/ creation needs to be done. Thus, naming
and permissions live in user space. No "device node is also a directory"
weirdness which is overkill in the vast majority of cases. No kernel names
or permissions leaking into userspace.
- An unregister_devices that does the same, giving userspace a
chance to persist permissions, etc.
- A userspace program that keeps a mapping of kernel names to /dev/ names,
permissions, etc.
- An autofs hook that does the reverse mapping for running with modules
(possibly calling modprobe directly)
Possible future extension:
- Allow exporting proc as a large collection of devices. Manage /proc in
userspace on a tmpfs.
