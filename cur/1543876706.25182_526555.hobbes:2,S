Hi Ethan / Andrew,
I have modified the previous patch (which was dropped from -mm) and now keeping
the statement making s_dentry as NULL in sysfs_d_iput(), so this should
_safely_ fix sysfs_readdir() oops. 
Please see the other mail for sysfs_d_iput() BUG hit.
Thanks
Maneesh

o sysfs_d_iput() is invoked in dentry reclaim path under memory pressure. This
  happens without i_mutex. It also nullifies s_dentry to indicate that
  the associated dentry is evicted. sysfs_readdir() accesses the s_dentry,
  and gets the inode number from the associated dentry->d_inode, if 
  there is one, else it invokes iunique(). This can create a race situation,
  and crash while accessing the d_inode in sysfs_readdir(). 
o The race happens when the dentry is getting reclaimed and detached from
  the corresponding sysfs_dirent though sysfs_dirent is still a valid
  node. Accessing dentry fields are ok as it is under RCU but the inode is
  not hence we may see oops accessing dentry->d_inode->i_no.
o The following patch always use i_unique() to get the inode number in
  sysfs_readdir. This is ok as sysfs doesnot have permanent inode numbering.
  It could be slower but avoids the oops.
