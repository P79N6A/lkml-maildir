Could you work out this a little bit to make ot more clear?
What's the difference between ATAPI DMA and ATA DMA?
Is this a controller(chipset) or a device thing?
What controllers or devices are affected?
Is this only a problem for mixing such things on the same bus? The same
controller?
It boils down to one question:
What do the users have to avoid?
