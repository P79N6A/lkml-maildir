It might be worth putting together a list of do's and don'ts for the
CPU architects if we have a panel again this year (and its usually
a fairly popular session, so I'd be surprised if it got dropped).
something along the lines of
Do:
- Detail what new features next-gen cpu out in Q1'08 will have
  that we may need to care about
- Ask for input on what features _we_ would like in CPUs in Q1 2010
- Tell us how we're taking advantage of things before that other OS,
  it makes us happy ;)
Don't:
- Waffle about process shrink roadmaps.
  Whilst it's good to hear, it doesn't affect the code we write.
- Moves to new substrates are fascinating to CPU manufacturers,
  not so much for kernel engineers.
- If something can't be discussed other than under NDA, don't
  bother bringing it up.  Those interested will likely find
  out about it through their employers anyway.
  This came up last year with a number of "we can't tell you"
  reponses, which made one presentation almost worthless.
  or perhaps it was particularly "we can't tell hch" :-)
Any others?
