If you always access the file only with mmap(..MAP_SHARED..) (or
MAP_PRIVATE in a read-only manner), or if you always make sure that any
programs that access the data use mlock() to protect it, you'll never hit
the regular disk.
mmap() is generally the better option, since locking down memory may not
be available to normal users.
