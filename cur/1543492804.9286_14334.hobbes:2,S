Er, please don't think I'm crazy. I tried it again and now it works. But it
*really* didn't work some hours ago. e2fsck still finds tons of errors on
the disks I wrote back then. And no, I didn't change anythin in between.
Well, ok. Seems as if it just was some temporary problem. I'll keep you
informed if I find out more.
Thanks for your help anyway
