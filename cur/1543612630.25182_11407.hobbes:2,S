That's what I get for typing code late at night and not testing it.
The correct implementation of that line is probably
lp:=(
rp:=)
CFLAGS_foo.o += -DMAX_CARDS=$(subst $(lp),,$(subst $(rp),,$(CONFIG_HISAX_MAX_CARDS)))
But as you found, you don't need that anyway.

EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DHISAX_MAX_CARDS=$(CONFIG_HISAX_MAX_CARDS)
will work just as well.  The reason that you do not get '(8)' that way
is because CML1 generates inconsistent output.  In .config the line
says CONFIG_HISAX_MAX_CARDS=8, in include/linux/autoconf.h it says
#define CONFIG_HISAX_MAX_CARDS (8).  The makefiles use .config, the
source code uses autoconf.h.
Inconsistency of inconsistencies, saith the preacher; all is inconsistency.
