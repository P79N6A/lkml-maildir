It seems like this would ideally be specified in the config file for the 
power management agent. So, before the transition to sleep began, the 
agent would enable those devices to wake the system (probably by writing a 
value to a driverfs file). 
The only thing is that you probably want all devices of a particular class 
to wake a system - like all keyboards or all net devices. I don't know 
what the config file format for ospmd looks like, but it might articulated 
like:
/* devices to wake the system when we go to sleep */
wake {
	keyboard
	network
	mouse
}
Right?
