Given that I know the SCSI IDs of every single device I install, am not
using SCAM, I don't object to using SCSI IDs, unfortunately, SCSI CD or
DVD writers are rare and costly - I'd prefer them over ATAPI every day
since I take one PCI device to connect like half a dozen narrow SCSI
devices. ATAPI is so wasteful. And I have bought SCSI for as long as
somewhat up-to-date devices were available.
Things get interesting though with ATAPI, ATAPICAM, ide-scsi, ide-cd and
all sorts of interfaces since probing various busses is something that
requires user intervention or trial & error to list _all_ devices in
different buses, and drives have unlogical bus numbers (seen these on
FreeBSD), or more generally, when cdrecord tries to coerce a device
numbering scheme on devices that are not enumerated, or devices that are
hotplug with device numbers changing with every plug-in action, or
whatever.
