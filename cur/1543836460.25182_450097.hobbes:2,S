But still it must be less than MAX_JUMBO_FRAME_SIZE, which is 16128
bytes, at least it is maxiumum allowed mtu in e1000_change_mtu().

I can not change it - code checks if requested mtu and additional size
is less than allocated aligned buffer it tricks allocator.
Or do you mean that even after 9k mtu was setup it is possible that card
can receive packets up to 16k?
