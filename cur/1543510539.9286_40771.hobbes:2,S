Hi,
I hope this is appropriate for the All Wise on this list.
I am having two very aggravating problems to which I am appealing for
solutions here as a last resort.  I am not sure these are kernel bugs, but
suspect they are at least new features which I don't understand.  My
system is RedHat 6.0, pretty stock, with their latest updates.  Both of
these problems are new, and an identical setup worked fine at RedHat 5.2
(kernel 2.0.36).
First of all, I find that I cannot unmount a file system previously
mounted via NFS, even if all NFS clients have unmounted it.  There was a
mention in the archive some time back that nfsd waits some period of time
before releasing the device, but that time was surely much shorter at
2.0.x than it seems to be now.  In fact, it seems to be pretty much
forever now.
Second, my HP-UX 10.20 NFS clients cannot see the contents of an exported
CDROM on a RedHat NFS server.  This only affects CD's, not hard disks,
which work fine.  It also only seems to affect HP-UX;  a Caldera client
works.  Both the HP and the RedHat systems agree in their system logs that
a successful NFS mount occurred;  "ls" just doesn't return anything on the
HP client. I'd be willing to try to debug this, or provide more info, if I
knew where to start.  /sbin/rpcdebug looked like it was promising, but it
just complains that /proc/net/rpc/debug doesn't exist.
Thanks in advance.  I don't presently subscribe to the list, so a CC would
be appreciated, but I'll search the archives as well for any answers.
