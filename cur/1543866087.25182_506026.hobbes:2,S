mlocked pages can be counted as dirty pages. So if we do not include
NR_MLOCK in the number of total pages that could be dirty then we may in 
some cases have >100% dirty pages.

Hmmm... I think write throttling is different from reclaim. In write 
throttling the major objective is to decouple the applications from
the physical I/O. So the dirty ratio specifies how much "buffer" space
can be used for I/O. There is an issue that too many dirty pages will
cause difficulty for reclaim because pages can only be reclaimed after
writeback is complete.
And yes this is not true for mlocked pages.

So you would be okay with dirty_ratio possibly be >100% of mlocked pages 
are dirty?

Rik had some other ideas on what to do with it. I also think we may end up 
checking for excessive high mlock counts in various tight VM situations.
