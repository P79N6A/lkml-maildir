Hi,
Suppose I want to create a page struct pointing to high memory (e.g. IO
mapped memory), that is, allocate the memory for the page struct myself and
fill in the values, what are the necessary flags/values (other than the
'virtual' field) I must be sure to set?  Does the page* need to be located
anywhere specific?  Does the pte field need to be set in anyway? The
question is relevant to kernel versions 2.4.20 and up.
Thanks,
Amir.
