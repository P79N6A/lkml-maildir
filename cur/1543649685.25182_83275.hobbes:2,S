Subject: small patch, but Linux Kernel Conf in 2.5.44 works great

Slight warning patch, but Linux Kernel Conf is really cool. From a users'
perspective, I note that the 'help' function is very fast now, which used to
be embarrassingly slow.
Make oldconfig also works as planned.
I would indeed however vote to make the xconfig program available separately
as well. Many users may need a different compiler for xconfig than for the
kerel (dreaded C++ ABI issues).
Right now, it is some hassle to make sure that the right compiler is used
for xconfig and the kernel.
