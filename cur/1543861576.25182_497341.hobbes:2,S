Re-explanation since you missed it the first time:
Per-channel operations structs work /today/.
The problem you need to fix or work around is ata_probe_ent, which 
doesn't properly fill in ata_port info for this situation.  Tejun has 
posted patches that kill ata_probe_ent, which you were pointed to. 
Mikael Pettersson just posted a sata_promise example that uses 
->port_start to work around this problem, setting the cable type and 
ata_port::ops properly at runtime, based on SATA or PATA.  See "[RFC] 
sata_promise: handle TX2plus PATA locally", I believe you were CC'd on 
my response.
So, working code for both the short term workaround and long term fix 
exist /today/.
If you get the setup right, you don't bloat each hook with "is this port 
PATA?" tests.  At present, your sata_via patch introduces these needless 
tests.
