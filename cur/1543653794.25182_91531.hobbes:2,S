Well, I tried on a 2.4.18+patches with gcc 2.95.3. bzImage is :
538481 bytes with -fomit-frame-pointer
538510 bytes with no particular flag
542137 bytes with -momit-leaf-frame-pointer.
So -fomit-frame-pointer shows the same as other's observation, but in this
particular case, -momit-leaf-frame-pointer made a slightly bigger kernel.
Didn't have time to inspect all sections, though.
Cheers,
Willy
