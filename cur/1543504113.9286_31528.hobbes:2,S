The practical problem of this is two-fold though: first, it's hard to
find a dsp that can match the cpu in the pc (price/performance is
irrelevant here cos you already have the main cpu) and second even if you
could, mainstream cpu design advances much faster than dsp design so you'd
be out of business in 3 months. Just think about how fast the mainstream
cpu speeds increase, while DSP's come with one generation a year or every
odd year.
