I've been on holiday and am now tied up in other work until the start of
May, at which point Jeff goes off and gets married so there may be some
delay.
2.6.17-rc actually has 95% of the stuff needed to drop the PATA drivers
in and I will try to do patches at least versus 2.6.17 final. The -rcs
will depend upon available time and also what gets integrated that
causes additional work (notably Tejun Ho's stuff will make much merge
work, although its work I'm very glad to do as the improvements and
hotplug support are all needed).
