the primary use i think would be kernel-internal task <-> task
waitqueues such as the futex queues, to transport the effects of RT
priorities across waitqueues as well. IRQ related waitqueues are a nice
'side-effect'.
another next step would be to transport PI effects to userspace code,
for user-controlled synchronization objects such as futexes or e.g. SysV
semaphores.
