	Just because I'm a frick'n idiot, why can't we bind capability
mask to UID/GIDs? That would solve a lot of the administration and
``what happens if we mount a FAT filesystem?'' issues, IMHO.
	* UID/GID capability masks (/etc/capabilites?) would be loaded
	  by /sbin/init. A user with the capability (CAP_SETUCAP?)
	  could modify current mapping via /proc/sys/????/capabilty.
	* The capabilities are only acquired on SUID or login. Ie
	  r-xr-xr-x man man   /usr/bin/man 	- No capabilties
	  r-sr-xr-x net bin	  /usr/bin/ping	- Capabilties of the ``net'' user
	  r-xr-sr-x bin audio /usr/bin/play - Capabilties of the ``audio'' group
	* Programs can _drop_ capabilties. If kernel support for capabities
	  is diabled, or their UID/GID is not in the mapping table, the
	  capability system call is a no-op.
	* Allows for distributions that can turn on or off capability
	  support easily. With no need to rewrite existing daemons/applications.
	* No need to change any filesystems. This technique would work
	  even on old Minix filesystems.
	* Easy administration - just do the same ``look for files that
	  are SUID and owned by this UID'' that we already do.
	So what do ya'll think?
