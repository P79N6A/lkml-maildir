Ultimately, does the patch actually change that?
Without this change, utf mode gets reset to zero because that's what the
kernel source code says.
With this change, utf mode gets reset to zero because that's what the
module parameter says and the user hasn't changed it..
.. only with the change, users get the ability to change that policy.
For the last 2 years since I originally submitted that patch, I've been
running it on my box. For those last 2 years, finally, UTF-8 input
actually worked on the VTs. Previous to that, lots of things broke.
