Hmm, I wonder.
I have a 1MB DMA zone, and 31MB of normal memory.
The machine has been running lots of programs for some time, but not under
any VM pressure.  I now come to open a device which requires 64K in 8K
pages from the DMA zone.  What happens?
I suspect that the chances of it failing will be significantly higher with
this algorithm - do you have any thoughts for this?
I don't think we should purely select the allocation zone based purely on
how much free it contains, but also if it's special (like the DMA zone).
You can't clean in-use slab pages out on demand like you can for fs
cache/user pages.
