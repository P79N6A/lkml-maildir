In the good tradition of proving myself wrong I can reliably create
corrupted files by wget-ting from apache (with sendfile enabled) as
well, so no more TSO after all. No TSO, no corruption.
The same also happens on a different machine with a r8169 (same model).
Tickless kernel makes no difference either. Shot in the dark, but hey..
