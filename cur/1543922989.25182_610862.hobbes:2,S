A lot.  Various pieces are a major effort in their own right.
Improving the kthread API so it can be used universally and
allow removal all of the kernel_thread users.
Reducing to an absolute minimum usage of pid_t.
I know several of the things with signal handling had Oleg
scratching his head.
There is enough development there I question if the code will even be
canidates for merging into 2.6.24.
I can imagine an -mm tree that has everything ready to go in
the next two months.

So we now have my patch which makes it depend on CONFIG_PID_NS.  
Which is what started this thread.

Yes.
