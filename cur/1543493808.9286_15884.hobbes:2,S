is there a nice way to find out *which* spinlocks are popular?  i already
know that the 4-way is seeing a big performance hit -- i'd like to know
where.

any chance this could make it into 2.2?  it's a free 1% performance
improvement on SMP.

this is a good idea -- it keeps the dcache hash table performing well;
i've actually measured some overall performance improvement. however, is
there a way to do this without a DIV operation?

how about dcache too? :)

do you have performance numbers on this?
