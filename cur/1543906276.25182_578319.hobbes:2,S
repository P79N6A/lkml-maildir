It's only the wrong thing to do if it hurts the common case too
much. Considering we _already_ balance on exec, then adding another
balance on fork is not going to introduce some order of magnitude
problem -- at worst it would be 2x but it really isn't too slow
anyway (at least nobody complained when we added it).
One place where we found it helps is clone for threads.
If we didn't do such a bad job at keeping tasks together with their
local memory, then we might indeed reduce some of the balance-on-crap
and increase the aggressiveness of periodic balancing.
Considering we _already_ balance on fork/clone, I don't know what
your argument is against this patch is? Doing the balance earlier
and allocating more stuff on the local node is surely not a bad
idea.

Task migration? Automatic memory migration you mean? I think it deserves
another look regardless of what SGI could or could not do, and Lee and I
are slowly getting things in place. We'll see what happens...
