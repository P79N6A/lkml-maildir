When you disable __update_curr(), you're utterly destroying the
scheduler.  There may well be a scheduler connection, but disabling
__update_curr() doesn't tell you anything meaningful.  Basically, you're
letting all tasks run uninterrupted for just as long as they please
(which is why busy loops lock your box solid as a rock).  I'd suggest
gathering some sched_debug stats or something... shoot, _anything_ but
what you did :)
