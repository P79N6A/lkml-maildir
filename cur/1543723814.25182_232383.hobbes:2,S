I have writen a driver as this :
1)a kernel thread receive data sent by other computer via tcp/ip, and
put them into a queue;
2)another kernel thread get the data from the queue ,and write it to a
disk .In this step,i implement by the follow code:
	......
	    generic_make_request(WRITE,bh);//the buffer head is alloced by
kmalloc by myself
            run_task_queue(&tq_disk);
   	......
My problem :
	In this way ,the disk's performance is bad.
	How can i do to improve the disk's performance ?
	Please give me a hand.
