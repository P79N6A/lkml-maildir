In 2.5.70-mm5 compilation fails if JFFS_PROC_FS and !PROC. The 
following dependency in the Kconfig file is needed:
--- linux-2.5.70-mm5/fs/Kconfig.old	2003-06-07 15:42:10.000000000 +0200
+++ linux-2.5.70-mm5/fs/Kconfig	2003-06-07 15:42:32.000000000 +0200

 config JFFS_PROC_FS
 	bool "JFFS stats available in /proc filesystem"
-	depends on JFFS_FS
+	depends on JFFS_FS && PROC
 	help
 	  Enabling this option will cause statistics from mounted JFFS file systems
 	  to be made available to the user in the /proc/fs/jffs/ directory.
