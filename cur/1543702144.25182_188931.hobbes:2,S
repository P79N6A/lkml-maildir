Just as an example...
Here is how the PnPBIOS reserves io space for which it can't find an actual
device: (notice it isn't necessarily related to ISA)
09 PNP0c02 system peripheral: other
    flags: [no disable] [no config] [static]
    allocated resources:
	io 0x04d0-0x04d1 [16-bit decode]
	io 0x0cf8-0x0cff [16-bit decode]
	io 0x0010-0x001f [16-bit decode]
	io 0x0022-0x002d [16-bit decode]
	io 0x0030-0x003f [16-bit decode]
	io 0x0050-0x0052 [16-bit decode]
	io 0x0072-0x0077 [16-bit decode]

	io 0x00a2-0x00be [16-bit decode]
	io 0x0400-0x047f [16-bit decode]
	io 0x0540-0x054f [16-bit decode]
	io 0x0500-0x053f [16-bit decode]
	io disabled [16-bit decode]
	io disabled [16-bit decode]
	io disabled [16-bit decode]
	mem disabled [8/16 bit] [r/o] [cacheable] [shadow]

	mem disabled [8/16 bit] [r/o] [cacheable] [shadow]
	mem 0xffb00000-0xffbfffff [32 bit] [r/o]
And here is the output for ACPI on the same system:

0000099f:             Bad checksum 0x6, should be 0     // hmm, interesting ;-)
So they seem to provide a potential solution for this sort of problem.
Thanks,
Adam
