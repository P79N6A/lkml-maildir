Subject: Hi! I've noticed that kernel.org advertises 2.6.28 as "The latest stable version of the Linux kernel is".

Actually that's either a mistake or I don't know what you guys call "a
stable version".
Since 2.6.24 there're serious regressions in all the following
"stable" releases. Both my own experience + 
http://www.kerneloops.org/
proves that.
Just to bring in some examples:
-- using 2.6.25.x I started to notice "oops"es in dmesg (what hadn't
been happening for a long time).
-- since 2.6.26 mine desktop system can't go suspend or hibernate. It
tries, but immediately returns from that trying.
-- Copying several rather big files (~ 25--45 GiB) from XFS on LVM-2
on MDraid partition to another one, I had the system rebooted both
with 2.6.28 and 2.6.27.10 (accomplished using 2.6.24.7-rt(sic!)25). As
you probably understand, that's the case you even can't trace where's
the problem, at least on a desktop with GUI, not on server with plain
text display. Although, I'm afraid even text display wouldn't had a
chance to show anything, tracing that problem.
So, I don't feel Linux is stable since 2.6.24. Do you?
