The earliest ACPI spec I have handy is 1.0b, which came out in Feb 2 1999
so this isn't true. The all knowing (and always accurate :) wikipedia
claims it was first released in 1996, though I believe that all the pre 1.0b
machines were using acpi implementations before the standard was finalised.
I certainly remember seeing ACPI capable machines circa 1997/1998.
