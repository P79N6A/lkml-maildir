I've submitted a patch for review for the above (which seems to have 
fallen into a black hole). Search the archives for 
"[PATCH][Please review] fix various missing return value checks in binfmt_elf"
I see there's another proposed patch by "ramsez" - mail with topic "[FIX]: 
fs/binfmt_elf.c compilation warns"
I've also submitted a fix for the last one of those binfmt_elf warnings as 
a sepperate patch - search for 
"[PATCH] small binfmt_elf warning fix (copy_from_user return value checking)"

This one I recently posted a patch for. Search for the thread with subject 
"[PATCH] check copy_to_user return value in raw1394"
I'll try submitting them again post 2.6.9 final, I've been re-reading them 
and I guess they could be done better. But if the warnings bug you too 
much, then they are in the archives and it certainly wouldn't hurt that 
they got some testing :)
