RedHat also made a kernel-2.2 dir under their updates
ftp://updates.redhat.com/5.2/kernel-2.2
should work... I pulled from a mirror site.
not sure which set is better (the RH 5.2 machine I moved to 2.2.2pre4 
doesn't have any of the 2.2 specific stuff applied and runs fine -- do
dhcp,
it's not a router, etc...)
