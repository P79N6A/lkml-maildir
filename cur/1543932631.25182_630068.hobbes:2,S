The idea with this placement was to keep memory management code with other 
similar code, rather than pushing it into security.h, where it does not 
functionally belong.
Something to not also is that you can't "depend" on security.h not being 
included all over the place, as LSM does touch a lot of the kernel.  
Unecessarily including it is bad, of course.
I'm not sure I understand your namespace pollution issue, either.
In any case, I think the right solution is not to include security.h at 
all in mm.h, as it is only being done to get a declaration for 
mmap_min_addr.
How about this, instead ?
