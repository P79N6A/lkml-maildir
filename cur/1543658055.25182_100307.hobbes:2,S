Well, actually, I'd like to see this patch in 2.4 asap too ;) It should
apply "as is" with some offset.
As Eric W. Biederman noticed, it may not be enough for some really
broken devices, but will not harm neither on these, and will fix the
problem on a whole lot of better ones. It's definitely necessary with
some WD hard disks and the "combo" DVD/CDRW drive shipped  by Apple on
some ibooks (Apple firmware typically does a reset of all drives just
before booting the kernel, without waiting)
