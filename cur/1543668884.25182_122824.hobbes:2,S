1. You missed the "fast" in "fast bochs".
The idea is to have a file representing the simulated RAM (anything up
to 64G in size), and to map that the same way as the simulated page tables.
Then the virtual machine can address the memory directly, which is very fast.
Doing it your way, the virtual machine would have to do a virtual TLB
lookup for every memory access, which slows down the simulation considerably.
2. Another use of non-linear mappings is when you want different per
page memory protections.  In this case you don't need different
pg_offset per page, you just want to write protect and unprotect
individual pages.  This comes up in the context of some garbage
collector algorithms.
Again, the idea is that the mapping (and in this case SIGSEGV
handling) costs a little, but it is less than the cost of checking
each memory access in the main code.
Both of these use many thousands of VMAs when done using mmap().  I
don't think either of these uses of non-linear mappings are covered by
your suggestion to use a 64 bit address space.
