Without too much thinking....
Would it help to require all major[1] header files to include all the
header files needed for them to compile?
We could make that part of the build process or we could make that an
optional step.
Obviously that would not solve any issues in asm-$(ARCH).
[1] There are ~600 files in include/linux - we could pick up the
50 most important and checkcompile them.
