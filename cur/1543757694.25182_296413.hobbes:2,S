I'm putting back LKML on CC since I intended to reply to your post there
once I got a bit of time.
No, we can't really do that _before_ probe is called. It's the
responsibility of the driver to do what it needs at probe time or later.
Some drivers need that reset (and not that many in fact), some don't.
We may provide a "helper" to use from the probe() for that purpose, to
make things easier.
Wether the reset code is kernel based or userland based, I would avoid
have it run synchronously anyway. If a driver detects that it's card
hasn't been properly initialized by the firmware (and the driver should
be able to detect that), I suggest it's probe routine calls the
appropriate helper, providing it with ways to get to the ROM (in some
case, the same helper will be needed for resume from sleep, and the ROM
may not be the PCI BAR one, but the memory shadow, though that will not
always work afaik).
Look at the firmware download helper, that's very similar. I want an
asynchronous interface though (that is you get a callback when the reset
is complete or timed out) rather than synchronous since it's wrong to
synchronously rely on userland beeing available (power management,
pre-root mount, etc...)

That's ok. We deal with that in the firmware loader code already. Just
timeout or check for errors from call_usermodehelper. You basically run
the user program and wait for it to write a "reply" via sysfs. In fact,
the existing firmware loading facility could be re-used.

It's up to each driver to detect wether it's card need to be POSTed or
not. Anything else would mean infinite breakage.

No, again, it's up to the driver to decide wether it needs to POST or
not (I prefer that to "reset"). I have no preference for the emulator to
be in-kernel or userland. I suppose it's easier in userland, just
re-using the existing infrastructure for firmware loading.

No. You don't. A lot of them simply don't care. Just adapt radeonfb, and
maybe the others ATIs and rivafb, period. If somebody want to adapt to
your facility, it's up to that person to adapt the framebuffer of their
dream. You provide infrastructure that _adds_ a functionality not
previously present. You don't need to implement it in all drivers
yourself, just do it in a few that matter, and let people who want the
feature catch up as long as "old" drivers don't _lose_ functionality. 
Also, a lot of those FB's are embedded things, or ppc/pmac things,
etc... and they simply don't fit into your scheme anyway (and mostly
don't have the problem in the first place).
Cheers,
Ben.
