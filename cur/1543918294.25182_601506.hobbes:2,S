They're not pinned (kswapds are pinned to a node, but still). pdflush
is not pinned at all and can be dynamically created and destroyed. Ditto
for kjournald, as well as many others.
Basically: it doesn't feel like a satisfactory solution to brush these under
the carpet.

Most smaller realtime partitioned systems will want to, I'd expect.
