I have patches for 3.0, 3.1 and (not yet finished) 3.2. As far as I can
tell:
src/squashfs3.2/squashfs-tools/lzma/README:
=======
This directory contains some source files from the
7z archive utility. (www.7-zip.org)
All the files in this directory was originally released
with the LGPL license.
=======
Now "originally released" is somewhat interesting form of expression, but I
do not think you can change license post factum.
The patches are for "personal use" but I am happy to work together to make
them ready for inclusion.
