And doing it by forcing them all to change their macro names isnt the
right solution. Its actually basically impossible to do back compat macros
with this mess. Your original smin() umin() proposal was _much_ saner.
As I've said, -ac will use typed_min(a,b,c), and that way I can propogate
back compatibility glue.
