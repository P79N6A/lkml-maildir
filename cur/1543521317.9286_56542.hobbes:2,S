     First, David Miller; Thank you for fixing the PTI driver!  It now
works without modification on 4/670MP with SBS450-10804 SCSI fast/wide
controller.  Much appreciated!
     2.2.14 Appears to be more stable on my SS-10's than 2.2.13 was but I
did get a spin_lock crash this morning.
     This machine has quad Ross 100mhz RTK-625 CPU's, 384MB of RAM, CG-6
video card, that's about it.  It's running Apache 1.3.3p3 web server.  I
don't know why but I seem to have more problems on Linux boxes running
Apache than any other application. 
     The 4/670 that I have with same CPU's was stable under 2.2.13 and
continues to be stable under 2.2.14.
     The meantime between crashes with 2.2.13 on the SS-10 configured as above
running Apache 1.3.3p3 was about four hours, with 2.2.14 it's about a day and a
half.  Here is the crash data for the 2.2.14 crash, on the console we get: 
spin_lock_irqsave(f808e66c) CPU #2 stuck at f00372c, owner PC(f003672c):CPU(2)
spin_lock(f014b9ac) CPU #0 stuck at f003bde0, owner PC(f0036538):CPU(2)
spin_lock(f014b9ac) CPU #1 stuck at f003bde0, owner PC(f0036538):CPU(2)
spin_lock(f014b9ac) CPU #3 stuck at f003bde0, owner PC(f0036538):CPU(2)
     This same sequence of messages keeps repeating indefinitely until I
reboot the machine.  The machine does respond to L1-A, didn't need to
power-cycle.
     Relevant Symbols...
     f808e66c is beyond the last symbol in the symbol table:
