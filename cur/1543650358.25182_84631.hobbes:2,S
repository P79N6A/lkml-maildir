Do we really need to store the ones that are not actually set to 
something?  You'll get a bunch of queries when doing a "make oldconfig", 
but saying N to all of them should just work...after all its the ones 
that are actually *set* that we care about.
Also, if you wanted to get cute, you could make use of the fact that the 
config names only use ascii chars from '0' to 'Z' which can be 
represented by 6 bits, then pack them together in memory.  I don't know 
how much difference this would make after zipping though.
