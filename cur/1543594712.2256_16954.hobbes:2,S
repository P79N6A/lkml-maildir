true, it wouldn't be a completely transparent switchover, but it seems
like the best way to produce expected results across a bunch of
different compilers.

Any others come to mind?  abs is definitely special in that the compiler
[potentially] can do additional magic with the type information it has.

	#define abs __builtin_abs
