Hi,
I've got another very strange situation, which looks like a bug in the
kernel:
Raidarrays with more than 600GB (approx.) are not correctly identified
and fdisk dumps core. Kernel 2.4.18 says:
SCSI device sda: 1289371648 512-byte hdwr sectors (-439352 MB)
 sda: sda1 sda2 sda3 sda4 < sda5 sda6 >
Needless to say that the disks do not have a negative size. :-)
BTW 2.2.21 says:
SCSI device sda: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 1289371648 [629576 MB] [629.6GB]
which surely looks okay.
Michael
P.S.: Please CC me on replies.
