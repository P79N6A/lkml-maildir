A better approach would probably be to introduce a vmem layer similar
to what Solaris has to solve I/O memory and vmalloc issue. What NUMA
issue are you referring to btw? I don't see any problem with the
current design (in fact, I stole it for my magazine allocator too).
It's just that the current implementation is bit hard to understand.
