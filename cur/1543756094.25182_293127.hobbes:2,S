I got around that by disabling preempt, radeon framebuffer, HPET
timer, APIC. Don't know which one caused the panic, will track it down
later.
Anyway, mount hangs for me too if I use an IDE drive, both with native
ide and ide-scsi emulation. It doesn't hang with a USB drive though. I
verified that 2.6.11-rc3 does not have this problem. Reverting
bk-ide-dev does *not* fix the problem.
