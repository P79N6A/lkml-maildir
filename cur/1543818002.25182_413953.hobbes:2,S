You patch needs to move proc_exedir_link into base.c instead
of replicating it twice (that is a maintenance problem).
I think if we can fix namespaces you don't have to be root to use
them that is a superioir approach, and will cover more cases.
I have concerns about security policy in this case because a proc
symlink is not a symlink.  So if you chmod an intermediate directory
in your prefix to 000 you will still be able to access it.
I'm not at all certain I like applications depending on the fact
that I have procfs mounted on /proc.  It's bad enough that system
libraries are beginning to care.   This means I can not run any of
your relocatable executalbes in a chroot environment unless I mount
proc.
If we add this it will never be removed from /proc, so we should
be certain we want this.
Given how long we have been without this I doubt many people actually
care, or their software would be written so it was relocatable from
day one.
I'm not certain the directory of an inode even makes sense, and
that is what you are asking for us to export.
