Hi Greg,
following are hacked-up versions of the -mm patches
	more-driver-core-fixes-for-mm.patch
	yet-further-driver-core-fixes-for-mm.patch
	return-code-checking-for-make_class_name.patch
rebased against your kernel tree (as of yesterday).
Except for the rebase, they are basically unchanged from the version in
-mm (some things like bus_attach_device() no longer being tristate, and
class_device_rename() being gone). Patches 11 and 12 are new.
 [01/12] driver core fixes: make_class_name() retval check
 [02/12] driver core fixes: device_register() retval check in platform.c
 [03/12] driver core fixes: fixup platform_device_register_simple()
 [04/12] driver core fixes: retval check in class_register()
 [05/12] driver core fixes: sysfs_create_link() retval check in class.c
 [06/12] driver core fixes: bus_add_attrs() retval check
 [07/12] driver core fixes: bus_add_device() cleanup on error
 [08/12] driver core fixes: device_add() cleanup on error
 [09/12] driver core fixes: bus_attach_device() retval check
 [10/12] driver core fixes: sysfs_create_link() retval check in core.c
 [11/12] driver core fixes: device_create_file() retval check in dmapool.c
 [12/12] driver core fixes: sysfs_create_group() retval in topology.c
Most of the patches but 1, 8, 9 and 10 should be pretty independent of
each other. I'm not sure about patch 12, since the calling function
does not check the return code of topology_add_dev() (but what should
it do if it fails?).
