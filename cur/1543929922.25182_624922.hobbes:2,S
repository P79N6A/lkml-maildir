I am not a good enough kernel hacker to exactly understand the code flow in 
udp_sendmsg(). However, it seems that it first checks destination validity 
via ip_route_output_flow() and queues the message then. The sendmsg() 
documentation only talks about buffer space. I can see your dilemma.
The reason why I'm pushing this issue another time is that I know quite a 
bit about system level application development. A very typical design pattern 
for non-naive single or multi threaded programs is that they set all 
communication sockets to be nonblocking and use a select()/epoll() based loop 
to dispatch IO. This often includes initiating a TCP connect() and 
asynchronously waiting for it to finish or fail from the main loop.
The dangerous situation here is that in 99% of all cases things will just work 
because the phase 2 SA exists. In 0.8%, the SA will be established in <1 sec. 
However, in the rest of time the server application that you have considered 
to be stable will end up sleeping with all threads in a connect() call that 
is supposed to return immediatly.

Even though I consider programmers that ignore the result code on a 
nonblocking UDP sendmsg() fools, I agree. May be the best compromise is what 
Herbert Xu suggested in <20071205001230.GA11391@gondor.apana.org.au> in this 
thread: At least, for connect() O_NONBLOCK ist ALWAYS respected. Because this 
is where the chance for breakage is highest.
