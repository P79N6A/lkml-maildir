Do you mean to say that you are observing the above scenario with an
unmodified kernel.org filesystem?  Which one?
I suggest you add a
	BUG_ON(!(inode->i_sb->s_flags & MS_ACTIVE));
in the hash lookup code.

You're right - the iget/iput is not needed.  The only caller here who does
not already have a ref on the inode is pdflush, and we already did an
__iget on that callpath.
