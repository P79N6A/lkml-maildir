Fun, yes, and perhaps not directly related, however
under high load, where the sheer numbet of interrupts
per second begins to overwhelm the kernel, might it
not be relevant? After all, the benchmarks do point to
tangible improvements in the performance of network
server apps.
Or are you saying that the bottleneck is somewhere
else completely, or that there wouldn't be a bottleneck
in this case if certain kernel parameters were correctly
set?
Just curious,
