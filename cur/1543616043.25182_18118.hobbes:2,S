Hi Folks!
Since we are back to where I begun maybe you can help me. A friend of mine
and I are looking for a PDP-11 DOS/BATCH system image. We have images of
RSX-11, RTS, RT-11, etc. But DOS/BATCH is missing. I recall having
disassembled some parts of it and it was beautiful!
Any pointers will be most welcome.
