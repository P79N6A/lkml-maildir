Well, wherever you store the request while mountd is pondering whether
the client is legit or not, you need memory for it. Sending packets
at twice the rate at which mountd can ponder does create a problem :)

Negative entries aren't needed at all when you decide to drop all
illegitimate requests anyway.

The hacking is not that fundamental. In fact, the request
doesn't have to travel up to mountd at all.
Do this in sunrpc/svcsock.c:
struct deferred_req {
	struct deferred_req *	next;
	struct sockaddr_in	addr;
	struct svc_buf		args;
};
static struct deferred_req *	deferred;
static struct deferred_req *	deferred_ready;
/*
 * New function defer
 */
void
svc_defer(struct svc_rqst *rqstp)
{
	struct deferred_req	*dreq;
	struct svc_buf		*arg;
	arg = &rqstp->rq_argbuf;
	/* Create a copy of the argument buffer */
	dreq = kmalloc(sizeof(*dreq) + arg->len, GFP_KERNEL);
	dreq->addr = rqstp->rq_addr;
	dreq->args.area = (dreq + 1);
	dreq->args .... more init stuff 
	memcpy(dreq->args.area, arg->area, arg->len);
	/* Stick into deferred queue */
	svc_sock_release(rqstp);
}
/*
 * New function, called when mountd pushes new export entry into kernel
 */
void
svc_undefer(struct in_addr clnt)
{
	/* Move all requests originating from clnt
	 * from deferred to deferred_ready
	 */
}
/*
 * And finally patch svc_recv to first look into deferred_ready
 */
int
svc_recv(...)
{
again:
	/* Extract deferred request from deferred_ready */
	if ((dreq = deferred_ready) != NULL) {
		/* Copy request */
		struct svc_buf	*arg, *darg;
		arg = &rqstp->rq_argbuf;
		darg = &dreq->args;
		memcpy(arg->base, darg->base, darg->len);
		arg->len = darg->len;
		rqstp->rq_sock = NULL;
		rqstp->rq_addr = dreq->addr;
		kfree(dreq);
		goto gotit;
	}
	/* Normal recvfrom */
gotit:
	/* Normal flags, XID copying... but don't bump stats->netcnt */
}
Still, I vote for just dropping the request, and wait for the
client to retransmit. It's KISS.

Which can be very very difficult. Consider
/local	*.foo.edu(ro) @trusted(rw) \
	safe.foo.edu(rw,no_root_squash)
And me typing on the command line exportfs -u @trusted:/local.
Client safe will remain with maximum trust, some clients in @trusted
(those not in the foo.edu domain) will have to be removed completely,
and some will have to be demoted from rw to ro.
I've twice written the kind of code that does this -- once for unfsd and
once for knfsd.  Just nuking the cache sounds like a good alternative
to me :-)
