The function that is returning ENODEV is the driver probe function. According 
to Documentation/DocBook/writing_usb_driver/ch03.html when that function is 
called 
"The driver now needs to verify that this device is actually one that it can 
accept. If so, it returns 0. If not, or if any error occurs during 
initialization, an errorcode (such as -ENOMEM or -ENODEV) is returned from 
the probe function."
It isn't a device the driver can accept so it returns -ENODEV
