I disagree, and here's the main reasons:
* fadvise(2) usefulness extends past open(2).  It may be useful to call 
it at various points during runtime.
* I think putting hints in open(2) is the wrong direction to go.  Hints 
have a potential to be very flexible.  open(2) O_xxx bits are not to be 
squandered lightly, while I see a lot more value in being a little more 
loose and free with the bit assignment for an "fadvise mask" (just a 
list of hint bits).  IMO it should be easier to introduce and retire 
hints, far easier than O_xxx flags.
