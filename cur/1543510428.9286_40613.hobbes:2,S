I have the same problem, but the Logitech (MouseMan+ and TrackMan Marble+)
will not work with my laptop in the 2.2 series, but they both work in the
2.0 series. However _both_ mice work with a HP Vectra machine I have,
_both_ in 2.0 and 2.2/2.3 series. I haven't had any time to look closer at
this problem.
