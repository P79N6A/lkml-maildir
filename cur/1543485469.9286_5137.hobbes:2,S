I've written file system drivers under WinNT & Win9x, and for both OS'es
there is a 'debug' build with extended parameter checking, etc.
I found CONFIG_KERNEL_DEBUGGING in 2.2.0-pre1, but that was removed in the
current kernel.
I also noticed that nearly every driver uses some kind of #ifdef's for
debugging, and three or four drivers use their own 'assert()'-macro, but I
couldn't find a central config option.
Is there any particular reason why there is no central option? (Until now, I
wrote one minor patch [with assert's()], and I immediately found a minor
glitch)
Regards,
