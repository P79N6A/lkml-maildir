    Hi all :))
    I've seen posts here about doing 'make allyesconfig' on 2.4.19,
but allyesconfig is not on my 2.4.19 tree... AFAIK, the 'allyesconfig'
target is on 2.5.x branch, am I wrong?
    BTW, if 'allyesconfig' is only on the 2.5 branch, is going to be
included somewhere on 2.4? I would find it very useful when doing
test compilations ;) A .config with all options enabled will be
useful too if 'allyesconfig' cannot be included on 2.4.
    And, if anyone is interested, I've compiled 2.4.19, 2.4.20-pre2
and 2.4.20-pre2-ac3 with GCC 3.2 and all has going OK (with my
.config, at least).
    If I am missing something, please tell, thanks :)
    Raúl
