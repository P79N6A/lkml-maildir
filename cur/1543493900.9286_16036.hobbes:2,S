Subject: General debugging flag?

When digging into a particular Linux driver on Alpha, I do two things
right off the bat: find the driver's debug macro and enable it, and
bump the default console log level to a minimum.
It seems like it should be relatively easy to automate that by using a
general method for enabling debugging for a specific driver, and adding
something to the 'make [x]config' process.
Is there a patch for doing this sort of thing already?
Thanks,
	Jeff
