I was referring to arch/ppc not arch/powerpc. But it seems that arch/ppc
doesn't support cpu hotplug anyway. So I guess it's indeed just a missing
config option.
Grepping a bit further shows that arm suffered by the change that inverted
the logic if the 'online' attribute for cpus should appear. Since arm
supports cpu hotplug but the patch left arm out, it doesn't work there
anymore (cc'ing arm people: changeset 72486f1f8f0a2bc828b9d30cf4690cf2dd6807fc
is most probably disabling cpu hotplug support on arm like it did on s390).
