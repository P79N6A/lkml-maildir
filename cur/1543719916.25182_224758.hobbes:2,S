Bad example, I can deal with that just fine. :)
Any code calling f_op->read must not break for any f_op->read.  So it
is perfectly sane to assume that all get called.  I build the graph by
turning f_op->read into a pseudo-function that calls all functions
ever assigned to f_op->read.

Those I only handle, if the callbacks are inside structures, true.
Will fix it when I find the time for it.

What exactly do you call aliasing?  Do you have an example?

Since Linus feels that said metadata is still useful without any
tools, I'll just ignore this objection. ;)
Still, some of the complaints were valid, thanks a bunch!  My todo
list has grown again.
