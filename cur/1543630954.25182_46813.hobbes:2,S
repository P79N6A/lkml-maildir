I have just switched motherboards in my file server, which previously had no
problems ripping audio from my Creative 52X drives. The new motherboard has
the KT266A chipset, but the CD drives are _not_ connected to that chipset's
IDE ports. I am getting "lost interrupt" messages when I try to rip audio
from the drives, or even mount ISO9660 discs (which do eventually succeed,
they just take over a minute to mount). So far I have done the following:
- turned off "dma" and "unmaskirq" for the CD drives
- tried ide-scsi/sg instead of ide-cd
- tried booting with "noapic"
- tried 2.4.19-pre8 and 2.4.19-pre8-ac4
Nothing has helped. The machine configuration is an MSI KT7266-Pro2RU
motherboard, KT266A chipset with on-board Promise PDC20265R FastTrak
"lite"). There is also a Promise PDC20262 (Ultra66TX2) in a PCI slot, and
that is where the CD drives are connected. Each CD drive is the master on
its channel, and one of them also has a Iomega ZIP 250 ATAPI drive as its
slave. Interestingly, the ZIP drive works perfectly, no "lost interrupt"
messages at all.
