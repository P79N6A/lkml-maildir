Hello, Linus and folks,
> And what about a 2.6 port? :-)
Yes!  Here is an m32r patch to the 2.6.0 stock kernel. :-)
The patch information is slight bigger, so I placed it on our 
Linux/M32R homepage as well as the previous v2.4.19 patch.
- m32r architecture dependent portions
  
http://www.linux-m32r.org/public/linux-2.6.0_m32r_20040316.arch-m32r.patch
- architecture independent portions for the m32r
