By the sounds of it, git could just use Mecurial or some variation thereof
as a back end.  Git is not tied to it's back end.   Afterall, Mecurial
just took the basic ideas from Linus' and adapted them to a different back
end.  But there are very few situation where Git performance is a
practical problem, and where it is things are being addressed.   Git is
already so much better for the things I do than BK ever was, I'll stick
with it.
