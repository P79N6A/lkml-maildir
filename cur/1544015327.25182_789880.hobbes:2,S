Three questions....  is the number of cachelines in use going to make a
measurable difference for your use case in the filesystem?  If the
operation is going to involve disk access, trying to optimize for to
improve cacheline utilization may not be the higher priority thing to
worry about.
If you have a million elements, and assuming each element is but 4
bytes (which seems unlikely; very likely you'd be indexing at least
8-12 bytes of data, right?) we're talking about 4 megabytes of
non-swappable kernel memory.  Is that likely to be happen in your use
case?
Finally, are b+tree so much better than rbtrees that it would be
worthwhile to just *replace* rbtrees with b+trees?  Or is the problem
the overhead issue if the number of entries in an rbtree is relatively
small?
