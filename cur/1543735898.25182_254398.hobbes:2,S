I've been rereading the code, and it could be even simpler. How about
this:
1) The card driver defines an i2c_adapter structure, but never calls
i2c_add_adapter(). The only extra thing it needs to do is to initialise
the semaphores in the structure.
2) The frontend calls i2c_transfer() directly.
3) The i2c core never gets involved, and there is never any i2c_client
structure.
This gives us the required reuse of the I2C algo-bit code, without any
of the list walking or device probing being required.
