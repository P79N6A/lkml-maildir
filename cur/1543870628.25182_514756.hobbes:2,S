This is actually quite common when using broadcom chipsets that take a
long time to clean out the tx ring.  We send a command skb out to
write some data, get the response some tens of ms later and the
command skb (with the pages) still sits in the tx ring.  I've gone to
some lengths to limit the skb memory used in aoe to help with the
OOM/swap issue and this has given me headaches.
