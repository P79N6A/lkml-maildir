I don't see it being difficult at all ...

I'm unconvinced we need to map more than 4 MB into low virtual addresses;
nothing seems to break with
ENTRY(swapper_pg_dir)
 	.long 0x00102007
	.fill BOOT_USER_PGD_PTRS-1,4,0
here and I don't see anything that would break unless we moved head.S ...

Arbitrary kernel size limits are bad.  Not complaining about a kernel
that definitely won't boot while building is even worse, and I think
the latter is actually pretty easy to fix ...
