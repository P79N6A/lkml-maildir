I would have to look again but I think the EMBEDDED dependency comes in
more from the code that runs the kernel at a different address.  But
the essence is not because the crash dump kernel is for small systems
(that isn't what embedded means anyway) but because at the moment you
can't reasonably have the crash dump kernel be a general purpose
kernel.
I have some patches which should use of a general purpose kernel.  I
need to find a few moments and get them into the -mm tree for further testing.
For most of the code under CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP my opinion is that all
that is really need is fix /dev/mem to be usable, and we can do most
if not all of the work in user space.  But as long as we are
communicating between the two kernels with a sane interface I really
don't care.
