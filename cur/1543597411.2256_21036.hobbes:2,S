I was referring to IBM's spec, as implemented in their recent SCSI 
and FC drives. You can find a copy at 
http://www.storage.ibm.com/techsup/hddtech/prodspec/ddyf_spi.pdf
WRITE EXTENDED has a bit (FUA) that will let you force that 
particular write to go to disk immediately, independent of write 
caching, but there's no suggestion that it otherwise acts as a write 
barrier for cached writes.
WRITE VERIFY implies a CACHE SYNCHRONIZE, so it's a write barrier, 
but an expensive (because synchronous) one.
