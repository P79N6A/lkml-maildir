Actually according to the changelog version 0.9.21 grew support for ARM, and I 
believe it supports some other platforms too.
Notice that Fabrice Bellard (who wrote it) is also the guy behind qemu.  My 
vague understanding of how things went is that at some point after doing 
tccboot, he was decoupled the C parser from the code generator in order to 
retarget tcc to produce code for other platforms, and got the idea of 
producing different front-ends too so it could input something other than C, 
namely machine code.
The result was qemu, which sort of compiles machine code to machine code 
dynamically, and which has taken up a large chunk of his time ever since.  
(The speed of tcc development has tailed off noticeably since, but he still 
spends a little time on it, and there are other developers...)

That's more a header issue anyway.  That's the uClibc developers problem. :)
