   Well, how about backing out the threads change until somebody is
   ready to fix everything involved.  I haven't the time, depth of
   knowledge, or rep for this.  At present the only thing it seems to do
   is break things.  With 2.4 around the corner, I can't imagine a flock
   of hungry geeks happy that their threading is reason for frequent
   reboots on a supposed "stable"*1 kernel.
I didn't realize things had changed that broke the old threading model.
Did Linus do more than add support for the new thread groups?  I didn't
think any that had changed that would break the old LinuxThread
programs.
