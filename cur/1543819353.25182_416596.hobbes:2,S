Neat, though a few questions that apply to each of the three ACPI platform drivers..

Why is this dynamically allocated? If there is only one per driver, then the
register() function could take that as a parameter -- instead of passing various
variable to initialize it with -- and return an error.

It seems that you're always passing NULL to this. And, if you're not passing NULL,
aren't you always referencing the single global instance above?

Is there something wrong with:
	if (value < 0)
		value = 0;
	else if (value > 15)
		value = 15;
? Or, could you just make the parameter an unsigned int and just keep the 2nd check?

There should be a space between parameters.

Could you print the name of the driver?

If the backlight fails to register, does it mean that these must also fail?
