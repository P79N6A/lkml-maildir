	Hum, I thought it was obvious. I did mention only this call
because that's the only difference, but what I did was :
------------------------------------------
socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
bind(sock, ONE_INTERFACE, MY_PORT);
setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, INADDR_ALLHOSTS_GROUP, ONE_INTERFACE);
setsockopt(IP_MULTICAST_IF, ONE_INTERFACE);
------------------------------------------
	And in this case, no Rx at all !
