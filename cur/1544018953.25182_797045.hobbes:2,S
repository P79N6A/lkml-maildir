Heh, yes, there's plenty of things to fix. :-)

Here's a tutorial on git bisect.

Assuming 2.6.29-rc1 is broken, you initialize the bisection with:
   git bisect start -- drivers/staging/winbond/
   git bisect good v2.6.28
   git bisect bad v2.6.29-rc1
Then you continue doing this:
   <apply my patch, compile, test>
and
   git bisect good
or
   git bisect bad
depending on whether the kernel worked or not. Repeat until git bisect 
tells you which changeset broke the kernel. The process shouldn't take 
more than 5 compiles/reboots.
