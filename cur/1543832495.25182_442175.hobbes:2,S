The idea here, is to do things completely transparent while being as 
unintrusive as possible, by relying on the current FS infrastructure, w/o 
introducing another VFS.
Consider something simple like this:
VFS - anyFS1 (r/w) used normally, unless ENotFound, then redirect read to
    \              anyFS2, or CoW from anyFS2 to anyFS1.
      anyFS2 (r/o) used normally.
i.e: Does the VFS provide hooks for perMount Handlers?
Thanks!
