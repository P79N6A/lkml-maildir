Appologies if this was already reported (I just received this message, but I see
-ac4 is already out!).
I am happy to report that ac4 fixes an oops I was seeing booting ac3.  I've seen
cyrix/cpu/M586 oopsen reported for 220p1, but not the one I was bitten by:  the
partition check of sda put sda1 (a primary partition) inside <>'s (as if it was a
logical) and then oopsed.  Didn't write it down, as -ac4 fixed things; but if you
want the details, I'll reboot and scribble.
Home machine is a dual-PII (Klamath), 2x  8.7G lvd scsi disks in raid0 via aic7890,
no IDE except LS120/cdrom.
Hmm - I diff'ed -ac3 against -ac4, and the only possible changes were in ide-disk.c
(for >8G drives).  I guess that applies to SCSI too. :-)
