How do you qualify "request"?
Is it plug the cable? Insert the disk into the bay? 
Flip a switch on? Manually? Computer controlled?
I cannot think of a physical action to plug a disk to a system that
is going to take an amount of time small enough so that 20 msec is
not noise.
A computer controlled switch might make sense, assuming the disk is
already powered, spinning and ready to rock - still, I guess SCSI
would like to enumerate it ... dunno how that works.
