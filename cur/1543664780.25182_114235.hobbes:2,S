Rusty,
In converting my 2.5 build to make the serial driver a module,
I discovered that alias chains in modprobe.conf apparently
don't work. This is with module-init-tools-0.9.9.
I had 'alias char-major-4 serial' and 'alias char-major-5 serial'
in modprobe.conf, since that's what's built into 2.4 modutils, and
then I added 'alias serial 8250'. This did not work: opening /dev/ttyS0
resulted in modprobe complaining 'FATAL: Module serial not found'.
Is this a bug or a design limitation?
I kludged it by using 'alias char-major-4 8250' instead.
