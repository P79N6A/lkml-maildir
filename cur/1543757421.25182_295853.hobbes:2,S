Subject: use of TASK_SIZE to determine user/kernel

We are looking at a 32-bit architecture implementation were we can have 
distinct address spaces for user and kernel, thus allowing 4G's for 
each.  In doing this we have come across the use of TASK_SIZE to 
determine if an address is user vs kernel (example mm/memory.c).  I'm 
wondering is it just sufficient to set TASK_SIZE to 0xffffffff?  This 
feels wrong to me, since it would imply that all the places that are 
testing will never need access to the kernel memory space.
thanks
