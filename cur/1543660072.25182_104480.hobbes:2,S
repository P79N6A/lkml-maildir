Hi,
I've already updated my bios to the last revision but Sony give a poor
support to those customers. I won't buy a VAIO anymore !
As I've read on the website spokin' about VAIO problems, the problem seems
to be connected to that, but yes, why not, it could be the SMI handler too.
I only know that the sotware could solve it antd that's one of the several
power of Linux other Windows.
Regards,
Florent CHANTRET
