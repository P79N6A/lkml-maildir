I must be an idiot, but why does Kbuild rebuild every file when cross-compiling?
I'm not editing .config or touching any headers, I'm making tweaks to
a single .c driver,
and it is taking forever due to continual full-rebuilds.
building on i386 for ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-uclibc-
I tried following the logic, but everything is a forced build using
if_changed and if_changed_dep, and I can't read GNU Make well enough
to figure out what it thinks is new.  I know make -d says all the
dependancies are up-to-date, so it's being forced some other way.
