This seems strange - looks like cifs simply called generic_write which 
goes to the page manager which in this case had to
rebalance/free up some pages which hung in local filesys routine outside 
of my code which I do not recognize.

As you mentioned the vi thread is another one of the threads blocked in 
the local call "blk_congestion_wait" which may be useful to understand.
I don't see any interesting threads in cifs at first glance, although 
the call stack for the cifsoplock thread is a little odd looking (perhaps
some junk being misinterpreted on the call stack).
Could you take a look at the /proc/fs/cifs/DebugData,  which (at least 
on current 2.6.7) displays some often useful debug data
including the lists of "MIDs" (multiplex ids - pending network 
operations on the wire) if any and also /proc/fs/cifs/Stats and 
SimultaneousOps
which display counts of number of operations pending in the vfs which 
looks like only one - in this case - which is blocked outside the cifs code.
My guess is that there actually aren't any interesting threads in cifs 
at the moment, and that we need to understand the
blk_congestion_wait calls are trying to do
