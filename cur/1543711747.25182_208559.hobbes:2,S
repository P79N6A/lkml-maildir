Subject: [PATCH] broken bitmap_parse for ncpus > 32
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
 This patch replaces the call to bitmap_shift_right() in bitmap_parse()
with bitmap_shift_left().
This mental confusion between right and left did not show up in my
(userland) testing, as I foolishly wrote my own bitmap_shift routines
rather than drag over the kernel versions.  And it did not show up in my
kernel testing because no shift routine is called when NR_CPUS <= 32.
I tested this in userland with the kernel's versions of bitmap_shift_*
and compiled a kernel and spot checked it on a 2-cpu system.
I also prepended comments to the bitmap_shift_* functions defining what
'left' and 'right' means. This is under the theory that if I and all the
reviewers were bamboozled, others in the future occasionally might be too.
Regards,
Joe
