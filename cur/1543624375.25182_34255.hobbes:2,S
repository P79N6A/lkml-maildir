Hi,
The way __get_user is currently used in mm/slab.c is not portable. It
breaks on arch which have seperate user/kernel memory space. It still
works during boot or from kernel threads, but /proc/slabinfo shows only 
broken entries or if a module creates a slab cache, I got lots of
warnings.
We have to at least insert a "set_fs(get_fs())", but IMO a separate
interface would be better. Any opinions?
bye, Roman
