I consider this abug in kconfig - users of "select" should not know
full dependency chain for selected symbol.

I do not agree here - the way our directory structure is laid out
"sound" comes after "Input device support" menuconfig entry.
Your patch makes user go back and forth in menuconfig, which is
awkward. I think using select is fine when an option depends on
something down the stream. If user already had a chance to select
necessary option then using "depends on" is preferred.
