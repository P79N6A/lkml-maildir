No, that will not work, if you don't have libraries at /. This should
be exact replacement:
init=/working_distro/lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path /working_distro/lib /working_distro/usr/sbin/chroot /working_distro/ /sbin/init
...assuming your chroot uses ld-linux.so.2. I believe above is ugly
enough to warrant merge of chroot= option.
...heck, how many tries would it take to get that right? Is chroot
/usr/sbin or /sbin?
This really should be in kernel, I should not have to partition my
disk to get booting to few different distros.
