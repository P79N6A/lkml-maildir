Thanks Robert for the reply.
But I notice that __set_current_state() is same as current->state. So, I 
didn't understand the safety factor on using __set_current_state( ). 
Also why should I use __set_current_state() instead of set_current_state() 
when the later is SMP safe. 
Thanks in advance....
