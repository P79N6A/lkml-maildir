Yes, and in the rest of my email, I stated this would be solved by 
replacing /sbin/hotplug with a mechanism to communicate events to a user 
space daemon which would process requests in order as submitted by the 
kernel. (All except the same minor/major, which may or may not happen).  
If the kernel is evil and doesn't submit events in order, thats another 
problem to solve, but it should for disk events, atleast.
