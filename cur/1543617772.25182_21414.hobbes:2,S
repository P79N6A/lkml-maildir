Subject: [PATCH] drivers/video/modedb.c - 1400x1050 fbdev mode timings

Thanks Ani,
Here's another one people might find useful - these are the timings detected
using the radeon BIOS registers for my 1400x1050 LCD. Someone might find these
useful if their XGA panel geometry can't be detected as there are currently
no 1400x1050 modes defined in modedb.c
cheers,
