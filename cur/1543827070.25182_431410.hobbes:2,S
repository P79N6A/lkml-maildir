Hi Christian,
What you are describing sounds like the bug I just fixed :).  Can you
please try 2.6.17-rc6-mm1 to see if this works any better?  I believe it
should resolve both the oops and the fact that your devices behind the
pci bridge are not found.  Thanks very much for continuing to test the
patches.
Kristen
