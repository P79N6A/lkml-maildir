   There is a similar background loadtester at
   
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/#zc
 .
   It's fairly fancy - I wrote it for measuring networking
   efficiency.  It doesn't seem to have any PCisms....
   
Thanks I'll check it out, but meanwhile I hacked up sparc
specific assembler for manfred's code :-)
   (I measured similar regression using an ancient NAPIfied
   3c59x a long time ago).
   
Well, it is due to the same problems manfred saw initially,
namely just a crappy or buggy NAPI driver implementation. :-)
