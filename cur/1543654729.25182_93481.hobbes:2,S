I've sent a note under separate cover to Justin about this particular 
panic.  I've seen it once before and I relayed some more details to him.  
For example, on my machine, I was using the stock Red Hat kernels.  The 
i386 BOOT kernel worked fine, the i686 kernel panic'ed just like this.  
You might try recompiling the kernel as an i386 kernel without a bunch of 
optimizations and see if that changes things.
