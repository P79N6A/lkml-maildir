What did Richard say which is untrue ?
Well, except that the Hurd is not really a kernel, but rather a set of
user space programs,  libraries and APIs, but even  some developper of
the  Hurd sometimes  speak  of it  as  a "kernel"  since  it has  many
functionalities which are usually in the kernel.

Self-serving ? What does FSF apport to Richard ? He spends his life to
help  Free Software  and  our communauty,  and  you dare  to call  him
"self-serving" ?
