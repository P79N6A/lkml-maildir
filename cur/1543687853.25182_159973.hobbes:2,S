I was thinking of something like a variable name, (eg. foo_close was
misspellt as foo_klose) then someone might be greping for "close"
functions and miss it.
Or if the documentation for the foo card talked about the "Dunlap
Enable" feature, and it was misspellt "Donlap" in the code or
comments, it'd be nice to be fixed.
But the lose/loose one is a stretch, I think.
Cheers,
Rusty.
