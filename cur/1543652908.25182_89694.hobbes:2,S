Could we make it easier to do queries? The bugzilla query page is complex. For example, if I want to see all new or all open bugs there doesn't seem to be a simple way of obtaining a list. I know the KDE and GNOME people have modified their copy of bugzilla and it makes it easy to search bugs etc. Have a look at 
http://bugs.kde.org
. They have a simple wizard for people wanting to create new bugs etc. If we want non-programmers to submit bugs, we should make it easy for them as well.
