On !alpha we are defining inline to __attribute__((always_inline)) for 
any non-ancient gcc making this a zero difference.
The bigger issue is that "extern inline" generates a warning with 
-Wmissing-prototypes and I'm currently working on getting the kernel 
cleaned up for adding this to the CFLAGS since it will help us to avoid 
a nasty class of runtime errors.
