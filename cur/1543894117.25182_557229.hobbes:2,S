it's not strange, with your kernel version "max_loop" will just limit
the max number of loop devices at most.
This is what happens with the mentioned patch (-rc5 and later):
+	/*
+	 * loop module now has a feature to instantiate underlying device
+	 * structure on-demand, provided that there is an access dev node.
+	 * However, this will not work well with user space tool that doesn't
+	 * know about such "feature".  In order to not break any existing
+	 * tool, we do the following:
+	 *
+	 * (1) if max_loop is specified, create that many upfront, and this
+	 *     also becomes a hard limit.
+	 * (2) if max_loop is not specified, create 8 loop device on module
+	 *     load, user can further extend loop device by create dev node
+	 *     themselves and have kernel automatically instantiate actual
+	 *     device on-demand.
+	 */
So with this patch "max_loop=32" will create 32 loop devices... but
then it doesn't allow more of them.
Without options it creates 8 and you (or some userspace tool) can add
more dynamically.
