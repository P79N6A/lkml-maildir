Nuh.
He said "userland rpc.nfs.Vx".  I only do "kernel-land NFS".  In these
days of high specialisation, each line of code is owned by a different
person, and finding the right person is hard....
I would suggest getting a 'tcpdump -s0' trace and seeing (with
wireshark) what is different between the various cases.
