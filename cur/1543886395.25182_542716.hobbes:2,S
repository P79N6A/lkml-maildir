Hi,
Sorry to spam the list so quickly again, but v3 had a critical
bug that needs fixing. Changes since v3:
- Addressed Andrews review comments (thanks Andrew!)
- sg_next() grew a silly bug right before posting, where it would
  pass back the chain entry instead of the next one. Thanks to
  Benny Halevy for spotting that.
I didn't include the big drivers portion of the patch since it
hasn't changed, so grab that from the v3 posting.
