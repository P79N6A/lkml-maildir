it's not only the 2-task case, but also less flexibility or lost
semantics.

well, until the cost of entry into the kernel is eliminated, this is not
possible - unless there are performance bugs in TUX :-)
but yes, getting a userspace solution that gets 'close enough' in eg.
SPECweb99 benchmarks (which is complex enough to be trusted as a generic
performance metric) would be a nice thing to have. There are existing
SIGIO based, multithreaded solutions (eg. phttpd), with varying success.
