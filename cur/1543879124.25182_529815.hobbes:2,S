OK.  I will run those regression tests.

I kept on getting requests from application developers who want that
feature.  My initial patch was dated back May 2004.

I noticed that while writing the patch.  We have the same bug right
now that nr_events is enlarged to consume the entire mmap'ed ring
buffer pages.  But yet, we don't account those in aio_max_nr.  I
didn't fix that up in this patch because I was going to do a separate
patch on that.

I don't think it's a bug.  akpm taught me the trick: we don't wrap the
index around the ring size in this scheme, so the extra space is not
needed.

I will look into this aside from this patch.
