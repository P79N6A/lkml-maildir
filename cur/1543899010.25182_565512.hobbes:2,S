OK, some radical ideas.
In principle we want a deadlock here. Tasks that are frozen due to fuse
are as good as frozen, there's no need to formally freeze them.
The bad uninterruptible tasks are those waiting for hardware.
Can we detect the difference? Perhaps we can label those crucial locks
and when only tasks in the refrigerator and tasks waiting on these locks
are left we are content and go on to suspending the device tree.
