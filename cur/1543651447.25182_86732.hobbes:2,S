You might want to look at the VMS model.  The sysadmin creates a startup
script that tells the kernel which files are to be granted "amplified
privileges" when activated.  There's a dab of kernel code to maintain and
implement this list, but there's zero filesystem code involved because
these are not metadata.  The kernel holds each "installed" file open as
long as it's installed, so there's NO way to replace a trusted file
without admin. priv.s -- you have to uninstall the file before you can
monkey with it, and there's a priv.  which controls the ability to do
that.
