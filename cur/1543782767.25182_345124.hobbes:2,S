Well, the IO port write itself might not fail, but the transition itself --
and we're reading the _status_ register here, not the control register where
we've written to. And 8.4.4.1 of ACPI-sepc 3.0 does specifically mention
that transitions _can_ fail, so I think we should handle this possibility.
