Actually it does not support other i/o schedulers (early stage of
development ;).
"Linux supports io scheduling priorities and classes since 2.6.13 with
the CFQ io scheduler." (ionice man page)
So we can only tune
antic_expire  est_time  read_batch_expire  read_expire
write_batch_expire  write_expire
for anticipatory and
fifo_batch  front_merges  read_expire  write_expire  writes_starved
for deadline.
I'll have a look on it.
