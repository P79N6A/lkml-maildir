These are MMC commands, not specific to the bus it is sitting on (be it
scsi, IDE, USB, or firewire).
The "scsi" method in eject has been using pretty much the same code path
in the kernel as CDROMEJECT for some time (probably since Linus did the
whole SG_IO thing to make burning to IDE devices without ide-scsi
possible).
In fact, one user affected by the bug I was trying to fix had an IDE
CDROM drive that would only eject with "eject -s". The "eject -s" being
"Scsi Eject" in the eject program is a misnomer really.
