I'm not clear how this is all meant to work. Your intial patch says
this is an interface to pass "architecture-specific
attributes" from drivers through to the DMA mapping code, which is
fair enough - we want to do something similar.
But it's not clear that DMA_ATTR_SYNC_ON_WRITE is architecture
specific. If I was a driver writer might assume it works on all
platforms. And in fact in patch 3/3 you define it in
linux/dma-attrs.h, so it's not architecture specific.
What is architecture specific is the semantic. DMA_ATTR_SYNC_ON_WRITE
is defined entirely in terms of what it does on ia64 hardware, and a
particular flavour thereof.
It just seems to me we're going to end up with a gazillion flags,
because DMA_ATTR_SYNC_ON_WRITE isn't quite the same semantic as what
Power can do. So we'll have to add
DMA_ATTR_SYNC_ON_WRITE_WRT_OTHER_SYNC_ON_WRITE_MAPPINGS_ONLY and so
on. Or, we end with subtle driver bugs because the semantics aren't
clear across platforms.
I guess I think the attributes should either be truly arch-specific,
ie. DMA_ATTR_IA64_SYNC_ON_WRITE. Or we need to come up with some well
defined, and architecture neutral semantics for what the flags mean.
