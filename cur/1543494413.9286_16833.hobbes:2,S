Just ask to NT fans for number like the previous ones in a old (3.5 years)
Pentium 133, 2.0.36,  running:
- Firewall, masquerading, and routing (three 100 mbps ethernet)
- Squid
- secondary DNS (40 domains)
- secondary MX (40 domains)
- NFS server (gateway to SMB)
- SMB file server (Samba)
NOTE: Its uptime is *only* 70 days because I had to stop it to change an  
ethernet. Last 70 days included an whole upgrade (with no reboot) of libc,
bin-utils, util-linux, nfsserver and nettools.
If you can get those numbers from a Windows NT, then let's follow the
discussions...
Ooooh!!! They complain about stupid UNIX text interface. Did they try to
add a static IP route using just the bogus "Advanced" TCP/IP control
panel? Of course they can´t, they have to learn the "old fashioned" BSD
like route command in a "modern" MS-DOS text interface...
Sorry, this is a stupid offtopic, but I cannot stand those people that
talk about "Enterprise" and "Reliability" and they can not even maintain        
alive or configure a "really working" NT server for a couple of weeks (did
they try?).
AWK!!!!
