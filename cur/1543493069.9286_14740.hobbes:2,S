Although it's not a "solution," did you try compiling the driver as a
module?  If you do that, can you rmmod the driver when this happens and
insmod it again instead of rebooting the whole box?  Is there any debugging
options (compile flags) that you can turn on in the driver to give more
information?  I don't have the sources available now, but check out the
source for the driver and see if there are any such optional debug flags.
Hopefully, someone with more knowledge than me about the drivers (which is
about nil) will be able to help...
