Two problems:
- You can't chop things down to single request times. A cost of a
  request greatly varies depending on what preceeded it, hence you need
  to account batches of requests from a process - this is what the time
  slice currently accomplishes.
- Whether a process has requests pending or not varies a lot. The
  typical bandwidth problem is due to processes doing sync or dependent
  io where you only get io in pieces over time.
A request based approach only works over processes that always (or
almost always) have work left to do. You absolutely need the time slice
or some other waiting mechanism to help those that don't.

Either the process is submittinger larger amounts of io and you'll get
the merging anyways, or it isn't. There's a large difference in time
scales here.
