dual licensing is a LOT easier. Really; esp since it becomes GPL anyway sort
of when it's distributed as part of the kernel..
About bugfixes; I'd recommend using something like:
    Alternatively, the contents of this file may be used under the
    terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (the "GPL"), in which
    case the provisions of the GPL are applicable instead of the
    above.  If you wish to allow the use of your version of this file
    only under the terms of the GPL and not to allow others to use
    your version of this file under the BSD license, indicate your decision
    by deleting the provisions above and replace them with the notice
    and other provisions required by the GPL.  If you do not delete
    the provisions above, a recipient may use your version of this
    file under either the BSD or the GPL.
like the pcmcia code does; eg you say "if you send me stuff I assume it's
dual licensed too unless you indicate otherwise".
