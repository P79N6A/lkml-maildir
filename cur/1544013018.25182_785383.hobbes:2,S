Tux3 is a write-anywhere, atomic commit, btree-based versioning 
filesystem. It is the spiritual and moral successor of Tux2, the most 
famous filesystem that was never released. The main purpose of Tux3 is to 
embody Daniel Phillips's new ideas on storage data versioning. The 
secondary goal is to provide a more efficient snapshotting and 
replication method for the Zumastor NAS project, and a tertiary goal is 
to be better than ZFS.
