This is a design issue, and not something where 'showing you the 
code' is going to help. The fact is that the way Linux is designed, 
device driver compatibility problems are ripe and I expect them to 
get worse. Binary portable drivers is how they are solved on other 
OS'es, and Linux needs this for future compatibility. 
I am complaning about this because I have seen these problems with my 
own eyes on our own hardware. It is not a myth. Device driver 
compatibility in Linux is not as good as it could be, and the device 
driver model is the problem.

So the mandate of the Linux kernel developers is to produce the 
fastest and lowest overhead kernel regardless of whether that affects 
future compatibility or not? Surely it is important that existing 
device drivers will work with new kernel revisions?

I haven't been arguing that. Please re-read my posts, and you will 
see that I am arguing for binary portable modules. Whether those 
modules are built from Open Source code or not is a different, and 
completely separate issue. I do believe Open Source drivers are 
important, and vendors will make their information open and support 
Open Source drivers if it makes commercial sense for them to do so.
This is happening in XFree86, and XFree86 allows for binary portable 
modules. Hence supporting binary portable modules does not mean that 
people are going to suddenly stop writing Open Source device drivers.

I have nothing against Open Source device drivers, and as I said 
before it makes a lot of sense for hardware vendors to Open Source 
their device drivers and make technical information available.
I do *not* however feel that hardware vendors should be forced to go 
Open Source because there is no other way that they can support 
Linux. In the Linux applications area, you can just as easily do an 
Open Source app as a closed source one. People do Open Source apps 
because it makes sense, not because Linux forces them to.
Not that my company is *not* a hardware company, so I am not talking 
about the product my company develops here.

Definately. All good reasons for Open Source. But not at all good 
reasons for not having binary portable modules.

Sure. But that is not what I am arguing!
