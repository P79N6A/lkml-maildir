They are still in use by a lot of drivers.. I hate to break even more 
drivers at this point in 2.5.x, and so quite frankly I'd rather just do 
this in early 2.7.x instead. Unless somebody really steps up to the plate 
and also fixes the drivers ("it's a ton of fun, and imagine all the 
adoration you'll get from teenage girls/boys/ninja turtles for doing it")
