IMHO, it will msleep if either one is ture, so we turn this into
return( not sleep) if both are false.
( eg, A||B->C   <=>  ~C->~A&&~B )   :-)
           while (driver_probe_done() != 0 ||
                  (ROOT_DEV = name_to_dev_t(saved_root_name)) == 0)
                  msleep(100);
 here:
      driver_probe_done() == 0  &&  name_to_dev_t(saved_root_name)
===>
driver_wait_probe_done_and_dev_appear(name)
{
         if (driver_probe_done() == 0 &&
                  (ROOT_DEV = name_to_dev_t(saved_root_name)))
                  return;
         else
                  schedule();
}
Thanks!
