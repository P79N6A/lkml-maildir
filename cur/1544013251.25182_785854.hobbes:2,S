(1) bash implies POSIX extensions; perl is actually quite portable.
(2) There are distributions that install with perl by default but not
bash; they use dash for speed reasons.
Sounds like though modulo dealing with 64-bit arithmetic, your patches
are mostly dash/POSIX.2 comformant, so you're probably mostly good on
that front once you address the 32/64-bit issues.  I'd also suggest
explicitly add a reminder to the shell scripts' comments to avoid
bashisms for maximum portability, to remind developers in the future
who might try to change the shell scripts to watch out for portability
issues.
