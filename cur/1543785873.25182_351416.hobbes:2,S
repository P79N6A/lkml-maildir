Most of the text editors have ways to markup the source files. Not even
the various editors are able to agreen on one method for all, so why
could the (Linux) world agree on one for all text files?

That's the problem of the language definers who absolutely want such
(IMHO absolutely superflous) features.

It *does* interfere since scripts are also text files in every aspect.
So every feature you want for "scripts" you also get for text files (and
vice versa BTW).
If you think "script" and "text file" are different, define both of
them, please, otherwise a discussion is pointless.

It *may* break just because of some to-be-ignored inline marking due to
some questionable feature.
And *when* (not if) it breaks, it is probably cumbersome to find since
you have pretty unprintable characters.
Let alone the confusion why the size of a file with `ls -l` is different
from the size in the editor or a marker-aware `wc -c`.
So IMHO either you have a clear and visible marker or you none at all.

Then write a short python script (with a "#!/usr/bin/python" line at the
start [without parameters]) natively on a Win*-system, copy it binary
over to an arbitrary Linux system and see what's happening.
