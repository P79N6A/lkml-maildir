The main issue is if you want to use git for development and accepting
patches from others, you need to be used to not using that git tree to
send patches to Linus.  To send patches to him, do something like the
following:
	- export the patches from your git tree
	- pick and choose what you want to send off, cleaning up the
	  changelog comments and merging patches that need to be.
	- clone the latest copy of Linus's tree.
	- apply the patches to that tree.
	- make the tree public
	- generate an email with the diffs and send that off to lkml and
	  Linus.
Because of all of this, I've found that it is easier to use quilt for
day-to-day development and acceptance of patches.  Then use git to build
up trees for Linus to pull from.
But you might find your workflow is different :)
Hope this helps,
