Hi,
in normal unix filesystem semantics, whether a file is read-only
(r--r--r--)
or not doesn't matter when deleting the file.
On the smbfs mounted directories (at least from a NT server) this isn't
true.
It fails to delete a read-only file, even "rm -f $file" doesn't work.
One has to do "chmod +w $file  ; rm $file" to delete it.
I modified smbfs to do the above sequence if a  regular rm fails, and
made it a mount option ("smbmnt -S" for "strong", like the similar
ncpfs option).
I'm using it since about 2 weeks and it seems to work fine (= no crash
and haven't yet found stale temp files from our rcs system...)
regards,
chris
