I'll submit a patch to make that arbitrary timeout longer, and make
sure the debug messages won't affect that timing again.

I think there's something funky about your BIOS, causing these boot
time problems.  That takeover problem should _never_ happen.  Can you
still get BIOS updates for that motherboard?

That'd seem to be a different problem.

Now that's the wierdest clue to that failure I've seen yet!  :)
Good that for you it didn't seem to cause other trouble.  I'm
starting to think I probably know where that problem must live.
