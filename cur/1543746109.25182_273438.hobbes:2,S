OK.  If this code was in the original opensource.creative.com driver
then there is always the chance it embodies some knowledge of the
hardware that we don't have.  For example set_loop_stop, which was also
in the OSS driver but unused, can be used to start multiple channels in
sync.  But as long as the CVS history is available this should not be a
problem.
