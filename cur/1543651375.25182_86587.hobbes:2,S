You can do #1, but you need to figure out if your interrupt is the only
interrupt using the lock or not (possibly hard).
In other words, a lock unique to your interrupt handler does not need to
disable interrupts (since only that handler can grab the lock and it is
disabled).
If other handlers can grab the lock, interrupts need to be disabled.
So a test of irqs_disabled() would show a false-positive in the first
case.  No easy way to tell..
