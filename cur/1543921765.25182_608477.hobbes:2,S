Cgroups doesn't change the locking rules for accessing a cpuset from a
task - you have to have one of:
- task_lock(task)
- callback_mutex
- be in an RCU section from the point when you call task_cs to the
point when you stop using its result. (Additionally, in this case
there's no guarantee that the task stays in this cpuset for the
duration of the RCU section).
