The proposed implementation uses a runqueue-per-cpu scheduler where,
inside each CPU, the scheduler code is exactly the same of the current one.
The big runqueue_lock has been substituted by locks that protects CPU run
queues.
By having separate run queues the length/cost of the goodness() loop
has been divided by N ( N == number of CPUs ) and the presence of
per-runqueue locks gives the scheduler a full parallelism between the CPUs.

Looking at this again, it probably is preempt safe... I probably merged it
wrong.
I'll try to fit it into my next kernel...
