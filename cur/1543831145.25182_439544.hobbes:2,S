Okay, I rebuilt my kernel with your combo patch applied.
Then, I inserted my US Robotics USR2210 PCMCIA wifi card,
ran "pccardutil eject", popped out the card and then inserted
a Compaq iPaq wifi card.  This triggered the following.
[ INFO: possible circular locking dependency detected ]
-------------------------------------------------------
syslogd/1886 is trying to acquire lock:
 (&dev->queue_lock){-+..}, at: [<c11a50b5>] dev_queue_xmit+0x120/0x24b
but task is already holding lock:
 (&dev->_xmit_lock){-+..}, at: [<c11a5118>] dev_queue_xmit+0x183/0x24b
which lock already depends on the new lock.
