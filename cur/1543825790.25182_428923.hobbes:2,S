Can we please kill this recursive locking hack in the cpu hotplug code
in 2.6.18/soon?  It's papering over the real problem, and I worry that
if it's allowed to sit there, other users will start to take
"advantage" of it.  Perhaps, at the very least, cpufreq could be made
to handle this itself instead of polluting the core code...

Fix (and document!) the ordering of lock acquisitions in cpufreq?
