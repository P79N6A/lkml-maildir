This is actually not needed.  Clocks are set through the setup() method
in the spi_master, and controller drivers are (courtesy of the library
approach) free to provide their own.  Drivers for word-at-a-time hardware
would still need to call spi_bitbang_setup() in their own setup() code,
to set up the per-device controller_state, and spi_bitbang_cleanup() in
their own cleanup() code, to deallocate it.

Exactly why there's already spi_setup() in the common infrastruture,
and why the spi_bitbang_{setup,cleanup}() routines are exported for
simple drivers to shift-register level hardware.  The real "bang four
bits into protocol" style drivers won't need that since the bitbang
setup() calls calculate the delays used to satisfy those timings.
But hardware drivers -- for word-at-a-time or buffer-at-a-time style
usage -- would need that to set the clock dividers.
