It is the network card... (you can find the message in drivers/net/3c59x.c)
The 0005 is the difference between the incorrect checksum and the eprom 
version
I believe there is an utility (also written by D. Becker) that can fix this.
It isn't a severe error - I've seen this after a W95 boot on other interfaces,
and I'm not sure why it occurs... (In the windows case, the problem was
cleared for every other reboot - wierd.)
In my case, it happens on a 3c509 card, and the utility is a 3c5x9setup.c
It allows inspection of the eprom on the network card, and had the ability
to recompute the checksum and update it. I suspect your card has a similar
capability to be programmed (like a netboot .
In your case you might look for a 3c59??setup.c utility. For all I know
it may be the SAME utility.
I checked www.scyld.com for such an utility, but got some "page not found" 
reportedly because of incompleted updates.
I don't think it should cause a problem, the driver looks like it goes ahead
and completes setup anyway. I think of it more as a hint of possible problem,
not an actual problem. The checksum SHOULD be correct, but isn't.
