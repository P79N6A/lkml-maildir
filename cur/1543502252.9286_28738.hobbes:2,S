Are they options that need to be specified before / is mounted
read-only for the filesystem check?  If they are not, you can simply
specify them in /etc/fstab and they will get set when the filesystem
is remounted read-write.  For example:
$ cat /etc/mtab 
/dev/sda3 / ext2 rw,errors=remount-ro 0 0
and the errors= line is ext2 specific.
