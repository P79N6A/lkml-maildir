hi jeff, hi everyone !
i can compile 2.5.50 just fine, except for huge-page-table-support,
which bails out.
but i'm stuck w/o networking, since the 8139too driver can't be loaded.
it complains about an unresolved symbol, because the mii module fails to
load due to "unknown module format".
the same problem occurred in 2.5.49.
my first thought was to run depmod, but afaik it's obsolete now...?
other modules (like tdfx or crypto) load fine.
this is a dual p3/600 machine on an asus p2b-ds (bx chipset) with a
realtek 8139 pci nic.
i'd be happy to try out patches.
sorry if this has been asked before, i'm not subscribed to lkml and
there's always some lag in the archives.
i'd appreciate a cc: on replies. thanks.
best,
jörn
