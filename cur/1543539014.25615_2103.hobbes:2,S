No, it does not show that.
It shows that you misinterpreted the wording of the man page.
I adapted the wording a bit to make things clearer, if possible.
       EBADF  The filedescriptor underlying stream is not  valid.
In your case the stream itself is not a stream at all,
and random things may happen. You can get the EBADF error
by doing close(fileno(fp)) first.
