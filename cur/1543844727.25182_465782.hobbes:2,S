There are no objections, but request for additional interface.
The only two things missed in patchset after his suggestions are
new POSIX-like interface, which I personally consider as very unconvenient,
but in any way it can be implemented as addon, and signal mask change,
but Ulrich have not answered how does it differ from blocking in
userspace and then calling appropriate syscall, I expect the difference
is only in reduced number of syscalls.
