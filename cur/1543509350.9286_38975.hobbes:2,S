I'm fairly sure that this is either a cabling, termination,
or just plain miscommunication between your drive and the
Adaptec card. I'll let Doug comment on that. The CD-ROM
messages below look - the driver loaded, the application
opened the device, and you closed the app.
Just to make sure - is this problem also there in 2.2.12?
