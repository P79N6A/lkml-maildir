With two batteries inserted you see:
> devilkin@laptop:~$ cat /proc/apm
> 1.16ac 1.2 0x03 0x01 0xff 0x10 -1% -1 ?
I think the problem is that your firmware doesn't know how
to report battery status when two batteries are installed.
When you momentarily remove one of the two batteries,
the firmware is momentarily able to report the state of the
remaining battery.
My guess is that the only solution is to use ACPI.
