Um. Mess with which flag? I guess you mean Reserved. I was saying that
imaging Reserved going away, so for the short term I'd be meaning making
the e820 set both Nosave and Reserved for those pages (which is what the
Suspend2 patches do so as to play nicely with swsusp - I don't use
Reserved at all).

I won't comment here. I don't start at swsusp code that much :>
