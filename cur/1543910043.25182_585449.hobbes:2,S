Good, finally we have some code to discuss (even though it's
not actually in the kernel yet).
First of all, I think this illustrates that what you want
here has nothing to do with atomic ops.  The ORDERED_WRT_IRQ
macro occurs a lot more times in your patch than atomic
reads/sets.  So *assuming* that it was necessary at all,
then having an ordered variant of the atomic_read/atomic_set
ops could do just as well.
However, I still don't know which atomic_read/atomic_set in
your patch would be broken if there were no volatile.  Could
you please point them out?
Cheers,
