I do believe 2.6.15 is the latest release that Ryan has tried (and,
strangely, nobody else has ever reported it - identifiably, anyway).
Interested in trying unpatched 2.6.16-rc2, Ryan?

Wow, great info, thanks.

Very interesting.  James can confirm, but I think that means everybody
can ignore my drivers/scsi/st.c patch for 2.6.16-rc, and the unposted
sg.c patches for the same issue that I was going to send Doug.
But the Infiniband, ipr and osst patches still look to be necessary -
unless maintainers can point to a similar intervening layer.
