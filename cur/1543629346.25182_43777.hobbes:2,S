Hi,
I have a Logitech Optical Wheelmouse and it is not detected correctly in 
2.5.12-dj1. It is detected as a 'PS/2 Logitech Mouse on isa0060/serio1' and 
the scrollwheel does not work. 
when I let the detection function print the devicetype I discovered that the 
devicetype of my mouse is not listed in the logitech_{4btn,wheel,ps2pp} 
arrays (it is 86).
when I put 86 in logitech_wheel[] it is still listed as 'PS/2 Logitech Mouse 
on isa0060/serio1'
when I also put 86 in logitech_ps2pp it is listed as 'ImExPS/2 Microsoft 
IntelliMouse Explorer on isa0060/serio1'....
It appears that it is not recognised in the if statement on line 405, 
printing the numbers in the param[] array gives:
param[0] = 8
param[1] = 0
param[2] = 0
param[3] = 205
param[4] = 246
In every combination of 86 in the logitch_* arrays I get the following 
messages when I use the wheel:
psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing X bytes away. (with X = 1-3)
the mouse does not work correctly for PSMOUSE_{IMPS,IMEX} otherwise the mouse 
and the three buttons work ok.
I do not know what to do next, but I want to use my scrollwheel!!
BTW the wheel works in 2.4.x
