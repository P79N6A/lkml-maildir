Hi Thomas,
> +#include <asm/i8253.h>
I don't see this file in include/asm-i386 and your patch only creates
asm-x86_64...
BTW, is there any reason 8253pit.h can't be used...?
Hmm... The best way IMO woudl be if arch code attached spinlock that
should be used by pcspkr driver to pcspkr platform device (as
platform_data) and we would not have private lock at all.
BTW, with all that usevent_supress busiess, does pcspkr gets loaded
automatically nowadays?
