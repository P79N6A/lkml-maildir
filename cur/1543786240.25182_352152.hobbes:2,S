From the fsck man page:
       The exit code returned by fsck is the sum of the following conditions:
            0    - No errors
            1    - File system errors corrected
            2    - System should be rebooted
            4    - File system errors left uncorrected
            8    - Operational error
            16   - Usage or syntax error
            32   - Fsck canceled by user request
            128  - Shared library error
An exit code of 1 means that filesystem errors were corrected
(successfully).  
This is a convention that has been around for a long time (since at
least BSD 4.x).
