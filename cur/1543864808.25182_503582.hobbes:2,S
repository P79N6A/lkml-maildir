this is a quite bad change. John's original clocksource code protects 
against double registry:
         if (is_registered_source(c)) {
                 printk("register_clocksource: Cannot register %s. "
                        "Already registered!", c->name);
                 ret = -EBUSY;
and Thomas' change keeps that property, but doesnt printk. Your change 
makes double registry possible, potentially crashing the kernel later 
on! (And this isnt theoretical, double registry did happen in practice 
when i debugged suspend problems on my SMP laptop.)
