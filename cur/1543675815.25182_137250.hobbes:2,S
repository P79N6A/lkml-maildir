Due to many problems with DMA locking up on ATAPI writers
earlier in the lk 2.4 series, Linux takes a very
conservative approach and turns off DMA.
It can be turned back on with:
  # hdparm -d 1 /dev/hdb
assuming your cdwriter is found at /dev/hdb (even
though the ide-scsi driver "owns" that device
and you address it as /dev/scd0 ). You can get
faster DMA modes with the addition of the "-X"
switch in hdparm but that should not be necessary.
