because the semaphore is really needed (by design of the subsystem) but
the big kernel lock (BKL) is taken "just in case", i.e. just in case the
design is broken. Occasionally, the lock is removed to "see what
happens" -- if nobody complains then the design is probably correct
i.e. things are declared to "just work" and the attention is shifted to
some other subsystem.... :)
Does it make things clearer?
