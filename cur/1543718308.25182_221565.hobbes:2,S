Trimmed the Bitmover folks off the cc-list (except Larry, who likes lots
of email).
Although my home machine seemed to show a regression, here are some data
for a dual P-III with 512M memory and SCSI. 
I mounted reiserfs and ext3 with default mount options. 
I ran the clone test described earlier in the thread with a kernel
updated this morning (with Chris' patch now in mainline), and with
the smp version of the vendor kernel. I also booted with mem=384M
to compare with my home machine.
It appears that the current kernel is an improvement over the older
kernel in all cases here (as we would hope) and that whatever advantage
reiserfs has over ext3 for this load becomes more evident with less
memory, keeping in mind that a side-by-side comparison between file
systems is not completely fair here since they are on different sections
of the disk for this test.
Each test was run three times.
