This is a long standing. A perfect example that triggers the named part is
Netscape : I one window does a lookup, all other windows are dead.
I don't know the exact cause of this problem, you'll have to ask the glibc
guys for this.
The correct behaviour in this case is syslog() to stop doing lookups,
dropping messages is unacceptable. Looking up a name afterward is no
problem, loosing important messages is a problem. 
If you're talking remote syslogging here, putting all local hostnames in
/etc/hosts would save named some work.
