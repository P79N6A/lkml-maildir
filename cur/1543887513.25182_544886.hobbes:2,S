Never mind. :-)

Long term, I'd like to have freezable workqueues, so that people don't have to
use "raw" kernel threads only because they need some synchronization with
hibertnation/suspend.  Plus some cases in which workqueues are used by
fs-related code make me worry.
OTOH, I have some concerns with that (please see [*] below).

[*] The problem is, though, that freezable workqueus have some potential to fail
the freezer.  Namely, suppose task A calls flush_workqueue() on a freezable
workqueue, finds some work items in there, inserts the barrier and waits for
completion (TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE).  In the meantime, TIF_FREEZE is set on
the worker thread, which is then woken up and goes to the refrigerator.  Thus
if A is not NOFREEZE, the freezing of tasks will fail (A must be a kernel
thread for this to happen, but still).  Worse yet, if A is NOFREEZE, it will be
blocked until the worker thread is woken up.
To avoid this, I think, we may need to redesign the freezer, so that freezable
worker threads are frozen after all of the other kernel threads.  Additionally,
we'd need to make a rule that NOFREEZE kernel threads must not call
flush_workqueue() or cancel_work_sync() on freezable workqueues.

Agreed.
