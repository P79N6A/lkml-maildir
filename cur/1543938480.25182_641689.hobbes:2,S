cool! A few comments about the patches that affect arch/x86:
dmi_blacklist.patch:
  +#ifdef CONFIG_DMI_SCAN
          dmi_scan_machine();
  +#endif
put that #ifdef into the include file and make it an inlined NOP in the 
!DMI_SCAN case. That de-#ifdef-ifies the .c files.
cpu-support.patch: ditto.
mtrr.patch: ditto.
inflate-error.patch: please use:
   quilt refresh --diffstat --sort --no-timestamps -p 1
when generating patches, to make them reviewable, uniform and 
noise-free.
no-doublefault.patch: looks ok. Please add proper metadata and submit to 
lkml.
sbf.patch: looks ok.
sysenter.patch:
+#ifdef CONFIG_SYSENTER
        sysenter_setup();
        enable_sep_cpu();
+#endif
hide these #ifdefs in the include file. (as it already does) Looks ok 
otherwise.
threadinfo-ool.patch: doesnt this break the scheduler? Had something 
like this in -rt, i turned 'current' into a const actually, but had 
trouble with keeping from gcc to do the right thing in sched.c. I guess 
we could live with current_non_const() that gets it from assembly. (and 
hence gcc wont be able to optimize it away in the middle of the 
context-switch) But when done properly, this is both a nice, measurable 
speedup on UP, and a nice space-saver.
tiny-cflags.patch: obsolete? Isnt CFLAGS already extendable? Question to 
Sam i guess.
tsc.patch: look ok. needs x86.git porting.
