Subject: rocket port patch for 2.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I have been playing with the rocket port driver in 2.4 trying to make 
it work. It appears that the driver hasn't been modified in some time,
as it did not work at all on the debian potato inbstall of 2.2.17, nor
did it work under a fresh 2.4.0-test6 compile. 
The problem was it registered all the ports at /dev/ttyR, and did not
try to use the minor number. I am appending a patch made mostly from
copying code from serial.c to rocket.c and fixing the structure names.
This patch works on my 8 port board, but I know that it needs to have
the registering fixed to the correct number of ports detected. I am not
knowledgable enough yet to figure that out, but at least this gets my
card working.
here is the diff against a 2.4.0-test6 kernel
