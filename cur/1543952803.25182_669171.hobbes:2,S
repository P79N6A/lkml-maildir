Subject: [PATCH 1/8] ptrace: forced_successful_syscall_return() macro
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/19/401

This adds the forced_successful_syscall_return() macro, a mate to
force_successful_syscall_return() to test rather than set the condition.
