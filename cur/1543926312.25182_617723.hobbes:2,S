Great, thanks. Jaroslav -- given that this list won't need moderation I'd 
consider it the main/only alsa-devel. The alsa-devel subscriber database was 
cleansed only a couple of months ago when moving from sourceforge so it 
should now be okay to just transfer all subscriptions.
Or maybe you're already moving things; mailman.alsa-project.org seems to be 
down at least....
Rene.
