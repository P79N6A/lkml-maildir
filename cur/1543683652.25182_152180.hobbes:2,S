I get
drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c: dc00: host controller halted. very bad
I get that hundreds of times in dmesg and then usb just shuts off. 
I have a VIA KT333 chipset and I have ACPI and APIC enabled on it which works 
fine under 2.4.x kernels. So far this problem has existed since I reported it   
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2003-02/0727.html
 with the 2.5 
series kernels.One of the differences between the previous messages I have 
sennt and this one is that usb shuts off after about 20 seconds or so after I 
start kde.
