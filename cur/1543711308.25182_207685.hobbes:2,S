There was one smp race condition in anon_vma plus bugs in shmfs
truncate, now it seems stable.

Only in 2.6.5-rc1-aa1: 00000_extraversion-1

	Rediffed.

	Fixed race condition during swapping, manage the PG_anon inside
	page_map_lock always.
	Merged Hugh's fixes for truncate.
	Changed my mind the second time and removed the union
	(per Hugh's suggestion), to reduce the size of the patch.
	Dropped some dozen of BUG_TO now that the code is (apparently) rock
	solid.
