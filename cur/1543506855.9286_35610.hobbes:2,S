Have you ever conducted a software project? Then you should try to stay in
sync with other developers, otherwise things go bad. Unfortunately (and for
reasons that have already been discussed) this has happened to the ISDN
project.
Now this has to be solved.
Somehow the current ISDN CVS code has to be sync'ed with the kernel.
Do you really think it would be best to split the diffs up into a lot of
small pieces? CVS could easily do this for you, but you won't be happy with
it ... 
And you don't expect the ISDN developers to throw away their one year's work
and start from scratch, do you?
Your request is very valid, though, once the initial large patch has been
merged. You should not allow to loose sync again, then.

I don't think so.
The patch has gotten some review by the developers. I agree that this is not
ideal, as it should also have gotten more review here.
But more importantly, it has gotten massive testing.
A major distribution, which has a large market share in Europe, where ISDN
is pretty common (much more common than in the US), has put the CVS ISDN
code into their distro since some time. This company also offers 60 days of
free installation support to all its customers. It would definitely not have 
included it, if it had lead to more support requests.
To state it more clearly: The CVS ISDN code works much better then the one
included into the 2.2.x (x<11) kernels.

I don't see any risk for a 2.4 delay. Those that don't use ISDN are not
affected at all. Those that do, will have a 90% possibility to get things
improved and a 10% possibility to have things broken. This does not differ
from other patches. And the changes required to help thos that got hings
broken are likely to happen with small patches in the 3(?) months left to
2.4 release. 
BTW: Some small bugfixes since the large 2.2.11 merge were already
integrated into 2.2.12-pre. I really think, it will work from now on.
Waiting for 2.5.1 won't make it any better, BTW. The patch will be even
larger then.
Please note that the customers of the said company are not told to compile
their own kernel. They should not need to in order to not run into all sorts
of problems.
