Hi,
I just read this announcement on a well known OpenBSD forum:
  
http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20060206150238&mode=expanded
So if anyone is interested in writing a driver for Linux for the
nvidia ethernet cards: That's a nice place to start.
The sourcecode can be found over here:

Under the name if_nfe*
