Hi Bradley,
I never even noticed that it was a tainted kernel.  But you did have a
same problem as someone without it.  I too have two machines with NVidia
cards that are not very useful without the binary drivers. Thus the next
two machines I bought (a server, and a laptop) I made damn well that it
didn't have a NVidia card in them (I used to be a devoted NVidia
consumer, now I'm a frustrated one).
The reason that I will no long run test kernels with NVidia is that that
module has caused more bugs than I could stand.  __Especially__ with the
-rt patch.  I'm very surprised that you actually have the nvidia module
working with that patch, since it does things that the nvidia module
doesn't even know about.  I gave up trying to modify the nvidia stuff to
work with the -rt patch almost a year ago.  Too much black magic going
on in the binary part.

I agree that it is good to point it out, even if it was just a
coincidence that you had the same problem with someone that didn't have
a tainted kernel.  It did help me to know exactly where the bug was.
But don't be surprised if someone tells you to try it without the
tainting module before they look any further.  If you say you can't,
then they very well might just ignore your post.

I say 'no', I don't want users to _not_ report bugs.  Even if it
increases the noise out there.  It's up to the developer to decide if
they want to look further, or just tell the user "sorry, I can't waste
my time if there's a chance that the problem is in code I can't see".
