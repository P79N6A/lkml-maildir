hm, i haven't updated my git-tree (linux-2.6.git) for a while and i got
similiar error messages. i updated cogito to:
% cg-version
cogito-0.12.1 (cbec08d191d36126ddaf021961cc8995794b4a72)
and the "cannot map sha1 file..." errors went away. now i get:

cg-merge: git-read-tree failed (merge likely blocked by local changes)
i *think* i did not make any local changes, but if i did - i want to get
rid ofthem and want a clean tree.
cg-status prints a lot of files with a "D" in front of it but "cg-status
-h" does not know about the "D" status flag....
any hints for this one?
thank you,
Christian.
