so it sounds like the real issue you are trying to deal with is that only 
root is allowed to make changes to the networking configuration, and you 
want to allow non-root users to make changes.
in doing this you started by duplicating the kernel networking 
functionality into userspace (your userspace L2 switch) and are running 
into performance problems so trying to push this into the kernel to reduce 
context switches.
besides your approach I see two other options on their way into the 
kernel.
1. no changes, run your switch in a VM and your users (with their group 
permissions) connect their VM interfaces to the interfaces of the VM 
running the switch/filtering. this allows them 'root' inside the VM where 
they can make all these changes.
this may have the same performance problems as your current userspace 
switch.
2. networking virtualization. there is work being done to be able to have 
what would be essentially multiple networking stacks on a machine to allow 
a VM/container to control some things without having to go through the 
tun/tap interface. This would allow a user to change the filtering rules 
without the changes being global.
however, note that if the VM's are more then just a test-bed and actually 
need to talk to the outside world, at some point they will need to connect 
to the real interfaces, and making that connection should still require 
superuser privilages on the master kernel.
besides, useing the standard networking stack has the advantage that if 
you end up needing to spread your VM's across multiple machines the 
support is already there, where adding a new IPC mechanism will require 
figuring out how to extend that mechanism across machines.
It also doesn't require the applications to be coded specificly for your 
mechanism. they just use standard networking API's and the virtual 
connections happen for them.

I'm not the person to approve or disapprove adding this to the kernel, but 
when something similar was proposed a week or so ago, the reaction from 
many kernel developers was basicly the same as I articulated. While the 
explination this time is far more complete, I don't think it presents a 
compelling case for why this needs to be added instead of useing existing 
mechanisms.
the fact that the answers for "why not use splice" have been "it doesn't 
work for networking" and "why not use tun/tap" with "we may want to use it 
for non-networking things in the future" seems like you are playing both 
ends against the middle.
in this message you have articulated a new issue (the fact that tun/tap 
will do everything you want, you just want to be able to do this without 
needing to have superuser privilages). This is a valid issue, but there 
are other options on the way that may address this.

useually it seems to be to add features to an existing family, especially 
if the features that need to be added are virtualization ones.

and the different answers have been to different problems.
if you need IP type routing and filtering then multicast over tun/tap is 
probably a far better answer.
if you are needing unstructured communication betwen processes then 
netlink or splice are the right answers (which one is right for your 
application depends on what you are trying to do)

but receiving data into a program from any source (pipe, kernel-space 
networking, userspace networking) all require system calls to transfer the 
data. so saying that receiving data from a pipe involes overhead on all 
receiving processes in a non-issue.

thanks for the explination.
