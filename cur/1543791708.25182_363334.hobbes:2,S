We've got one user reporting that he's getting the following
message..
"program ddcprobe is using MAP_PRIVATE, PROT_WRITE mmap of VM_RESERVED memory"
since this cset.
So what should happen here, does that app need changing? Or do we just
need to get Hugh's changes merged?
It's likely that anything else that uses lrmi is going to be affected
in the same way, though off the top of my head, I don't know what (if any)
other apps there may be.
