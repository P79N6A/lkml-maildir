Changes says modutils 2.3.13 and it *was* patched at the same time that
the modules_install change went in, I did it.  You must run modutils
2.3.13 for the new modules structure; 2.3.14 is not required for
modules_install.  2.3.14 fixes a problem with distributions which have
  path[xxx]=/lib/modules/`uname -r`
in modules.conf.  So the kernel does not need modutils 2.3.14, only
people with incorrectly set parameter files.  Changes is right.
