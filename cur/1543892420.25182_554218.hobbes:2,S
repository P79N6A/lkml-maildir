How will you find the 5 most contended locks with 1 grep?
It used to be:
  grep ":" /proc/lock_stat | head -n 5
lock stat is more about finding who is bad than examining a particular
lock (of course in the process of fixing that lock, that does become
interesting).
Nor was it _that_ wide, it easily fit into an xterm, even on my laptop.
