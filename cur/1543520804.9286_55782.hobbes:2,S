Hi
when trying to use the sysrq option in the kernel
under a P233/64MB RAM and the frame buffer driver
the console locked up completly and there was no
response from the keyboard light when the caps lock
key, scoll lock or num lock key was pressed.
it also does this evey time and i have to login
from another machine to reboot it this was when
the /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq had a 0 in it
could anyone explain this
thanks
	James
