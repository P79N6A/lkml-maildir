They could get much better bang-for-the-buck (as in memory saved
for amount of work invested) by tackling some the dynamic memory allocation
pigs.
In general it's a trade off between how much work and patch churn versus
benefit, and some of the annotations really don't look too good on this
scale.

CONFIG_HOTPLUG is widely used for suspend on multi core systems.
