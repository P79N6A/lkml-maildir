OK, which was the last one which ran stable for you?  I note that you've
got a failure marked "2.4.20" in the log.

Do you have the backtrace for that?  I can't see any way that particular
error can happen unless the kernel's memory is getting corrupt, or
there's a corrupt superblock coming in from the disk.  
Also, are you sure you've been ksymoops'ing these from the right
System.map files?  The traces really don't make a lot of sense.

If that happens again, serial console is the best way of getting the
full oops.  How much memory does your system have?  Have you ever seen
this error before?  
Cheers,
