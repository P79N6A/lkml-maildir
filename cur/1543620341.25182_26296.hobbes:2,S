Hi there,
the new change log entries in announcements sure are nice.  I miss
the real names of contributors, though:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeSet@1.219, 2002-02-05 18:31:49-08:00, torvalds@penguin.transmeta.com
  Makefile:
    Update version
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This particular email address I am perfectly able to map to a user name,
but it would be nice for most others to have the relevant script tag on
the real life name also.  Apologies to ak@muc.de, for example, but that
address does not ring a bell with me.
Have fun,
Morten
