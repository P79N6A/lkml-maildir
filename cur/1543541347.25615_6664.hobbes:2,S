If I get you right, there's a "re-blocker" in the CD-ROM driver that tries
to translate 512b-block accesses from the application to 2048b-sector
requests for the CD-ROM drive for those (apparently ubiquitary) drives that won't
handle 512b-sectors themselves?
And it fails? 
Sad. Is this on the To-Do list?
tschüß,
