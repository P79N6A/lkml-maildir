It might be useful to voyager, but unless the offset were random, people
would simply hardwire it.

Not quite.  On apic systems, the boot CPU can be an arbitrary physical
id but is conventionally logical id 0.  On voyager, the CPU id actually
maps to a fixed location, so there's no sense in having a logical id.
The booting CPU on voyager is simply the lowest numbered CPU that comes
up through the SUS boot.
