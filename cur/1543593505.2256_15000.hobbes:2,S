If something is done, Celsius should be default (as the US is brain-dead
like that; nearly everywhere else uses Celsius as the standard) and
fahrenheit as an option.
I wrote a patch for the 'sensors' utility in lm_sensors that did just
that; supplied fahrenheit conversion for the sensors via a commandline
option. Perhaps there could be a config option in the kernel (or a proc
entry/ioctl?) that controls this.
