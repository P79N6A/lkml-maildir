I work for a large corporation (by large, I mean +1000 employees for
just the IS dept), and have finally gotten my "30-minutes" in front of
their standards committe to present Linux. This is a Good Thing.
What I'm looking for is a pointer to resources that I can pull from to
create my presentation. I've got "The Cathedral and the Bazzar" as well
as "Managers Guide To Linux" What I'm looking for now is a sort of rough
roadplan for the 2.4.x kernel etc. Any thoughts on how long before we
see ACL's, journaling filesystems, Heavy Duty SMP support... remember
this is for the PHB's.... I'm currently running in our testbed a
Dual-Processor PII system as File/Print/Intranet for our R&D group
(2.2.8 kernel) it works fine.
Also if any of you have participated in large scale migrations, NT to
Linux for File/Print and possibly desktop could you give me any ideas on
where to pull some numbers for my presentation.
I'm not looking for alot of responses... just thoughts from anyone who
has any.
Thanks,
D. Clyde
