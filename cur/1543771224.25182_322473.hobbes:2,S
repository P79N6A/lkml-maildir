I forgot. You basically turn it into one single big system wide mutex and
and deal pathological cases as it turns up. Doing this is optional and
if you can get away with letting the cli/sti function stay in place, then
it's less work for us to handle.

There are many ways to handle various issues at runtime. We have the
instrumentation in place to detect it and conversion is easy since it's
