Short answer: cache is the use of memory to store what would otherwise
have to be read from disk, like parts of frequently used files etc.
Linux will trade off cache against other RAM needs like program memory
on an ongoing basis, and (almost always) does a really good job of it.
Don't be alarmed about going into swap somewhat in normal
operation--Linux is storing less important data on the disk to make
more room in RAM for "hot" data.  Obviously, if you have hundreds of
megs in swap or it grows quickly, you may need to look at it.

That means the kernel is doing exactly what it's supposed to do.  If
memory isn't needed by programs and isn't used for cache, it just goes
to waste, so Linux tries to use it for one or the other.  :)
