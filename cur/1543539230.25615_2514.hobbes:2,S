Hm. util-linux-2.10f doesn't have this, 2.10h does. 2.10g isn't on
kernel.org.
However, you really should have swapped to index(3) instead (or
better, strchr(3) which is POSIX). Building an assumption on /dev
isn't very good either. It still wouldn't be 100% correct (it'll fall
over if your device nodes/devfs mountpoint are deeper), but it would
be better.
