the benchmark "results" _look_ like being authored by
some qa engineers... or sysadmins or something...
*** only a deep/intimate knowledge of kernel and fs
and acl implementation details and many other areas
could suggest a credible conclusion (most likely
without even needing any "profiling" at all... on pure
theoretical basis, mostly because you would know what
goes where and when and how and why and how much it
adds here and there, etc, etc, etc)
and i personally have a strong doubt that if the cpu
activity was statistically increased with 7% for the
very same elementary I/O, linus would have accepted
this degradation... my $0.02... :-)
