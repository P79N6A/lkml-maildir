They have absolutely nothing to do with the kernel, nor printk.
They're to do with klogd, the process which reads kernel messages and
writes them via a socket to syslogd.
If klogd is started with out -x, it will want to read the System.map
file and do the broken lookup of things it thinks are addresses in
kernel messages.  This is not recommended practice.  For kernels with
kallsyms enabled, klogd should be started with -x.
After your kernel has booted, login and run dmesg.  You'll notice that
the first 4 lines are not as you expect.
