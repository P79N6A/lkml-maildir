Nobdy argued against adding nice arch specific helpers to do higher
level operations (for example, atomic_add_unless I added was able to
reduce the use of cmpxchg in the kernel and can be optimally
implemented with ll/sc). I implemented it specifically because I
didn't want to use atomic_cmpxchg directly for lockless pagecache,
exactly because it is suboptimal on RISCs in that performance
critical path.
The point is that if somebody wants to implement some fancy lockless
code, atomic_cmpxchg is a good tool to use that does not require
writing the assembly for two dozen architectures. If it is performance
critical then it can absolutely be rewritten in an optimal manner.

So, what would your ll/sc abstraction look like? Let's hear it.
The one I'm thinking of goes something like this:
   atomic_ll() / atomic_sc() with the restriction that they cannot be
   nested, you cannot write any C code between them, and may only call
   into some specific set of atomic_llsc_xxx primitives, operating on
   the address given to ll, and must not have more than a given number
   of instructions between them. Also, the atomic_sc won't always fail
   if there were interleaving stores.
