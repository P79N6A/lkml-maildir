Hi Petko,
David Brownell pointed out that you are the author of this driver (rtl8150).
My laptop is crashing every time I remove the Linksys EtherFast 10/100
Compact Network Adapter (model USB100M) from the USB port.
Here's a link to the discussion thus far:

Here's the stacktrace:

I have reproduced the bug with vanilla 2.6.17.  I am currently working my
back through kernel versions to try to isolate the responsible patches.
