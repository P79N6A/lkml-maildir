I just retested with the encoders at nice 0, and the x/gforce combo is
terrible.  Funny thing though, x/gforce isn't as badly affected with a
kernel build.  Any build is quite noticable, but even at -j8, the effect
doen't seem to be (very brief test warning applies) as bad as with only
the two encoders running.  That seems quite odd.
