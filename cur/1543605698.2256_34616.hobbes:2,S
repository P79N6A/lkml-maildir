Yes, this is a bit of a problem - it's probably atime updates,
things which write to inodes, etc.  A commit will be forced within
five seconds of this happening.

That is certainly a simple way of addressing the problem, and
it does work.  You'll need to edit fs/jbd/journal.c and change the `5'
in this line:
        journal->j_commit_interval = (HZ * 5);
to 3600 or whatever.  I'd agree that this user interface could be
improved :)  Probably a field in the journal superblock.
The result of this change is that you could lose up to an hour's work
after a crash rather than up to five seconds worth.  You can manually
force a commit at any time by running /bin/sync.
Probably the best way of addressing all of this is teach ext3 to
look at the kupdate writeback interval from /proc/sys/vm/bdflush.
Users can then set the value in there to, say, one hour and it
should all just work.
