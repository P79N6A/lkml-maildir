  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Excuse me, I hadn't looked at your code closely.  Everything I said up
to that last line is fine.  But the last line doesn't apply because
you don't have a local_irq_disable().
You can remove your local_irq_enable() instead, if you want, but for
a different reason.  That one _is_ defensive. :)
