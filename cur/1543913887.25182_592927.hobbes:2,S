Subject: [PATCH] Fix failure to resume from initrds.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all.
Commit 831441862956fffa17b9801db37e6ea1650b0f69 (Freezer: make kernel threads
nonfreezable by default) breaks freezing when attempting to resume from an
initrd, because the init (which is freezeable) spins while waiting for another
thread to run /linuxrc, but doesn't check whether it has been told to enter
the refrigerator. The original patch replaced a call to try_to_freeze() with a
call to yield(). I believe a simple reversion is wrong because
if !CONFIG_PM_SLEEP, try_to_freeze() is a noop. It should still yield.
