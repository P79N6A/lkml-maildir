You can't rate limit a panic.
It would be better to fix the filesytem bugs instead of adding
security measures preventing crashing filesystems to crash the rest of
the kernel.
And to catch every possible crash of filesystem code would be a lot
more work than fixing the filesystems themselves AFAIK.
