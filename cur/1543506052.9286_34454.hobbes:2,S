Why? It is telling you exactly what is going on. It cannot open the
configured root device, sda1 (look for 8, 1 in /dev). 
Possible causes are:
 - he didn't compile the scsi driver, 
 - the scsi card wasn't detected, 
 - There are no scsi disks on the scsi bus.
 - he didn't compile scsi DISK support
 - he doesn't have any scsi devices at all. IDE-only system. (*)
 - His root device is sda2.
So what did you want the kernel to say? All this? I'm pretty sure I
forgot a few options too. If you're going to do this for every
message, the kernel will grow a lot. IBMs solution is to start every
message with a number and document the number and possible solutions
in a book. I don't think that that's a workable solution either.

(*) This is the option -=I=- consider most likely. It happens when
somehow you end up with the default root-disk-setting.
