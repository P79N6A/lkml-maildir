I think most (all?) of the machines, OpenWRT runs on, are running
a bcm43xx wireless chip. This chip has a hardware random number
generator. patches to utilize it recently went into -mm.
But I must admit, we don't know how it generates random numbers.
But someone did some RNG tests on it in the past (I think it was
Johannes).
