It's nothing to do with the OS most likely. Some BIOS's modify the FSB
speed and other settings as a way to provide a sort of "fail safe" boot
mode if a problem was detected.
The BIOS on my board will do that if the system fails to POST and I've
also seen it happen sometimes after a crash.
It's even documented in the motherboard manual that it will behave this
way when running in JumperFree mode (this is an ASUS A7M266 board btw).
The exact text from my motherboard manual is :
"Notes for JumperFree Mode
 System Hangup
 If your system crashes or hangs due to improper frequency settings, power
 OFF your system and restart. The system will start up in safe mode
 running at a DRAM-to-CPU frequency ratio of 3:3 and a bus speed of
 100MHz. You will then be led to BIOS setup to adjust the configurations."
