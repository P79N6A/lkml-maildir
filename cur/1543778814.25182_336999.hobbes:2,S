The thing is, there are basically _zero_ upsides to using the __builtin_xx 
functions on x86.
There may be more upsides on other architectures (*cough*ia64*cough*) that 
have strange scheduling issues and other complexities, but on x86 in 
particular, the __builtin_xxx() functions tend to be a lot more pain than 
they are worth. Not only do they have strange limitations (on selection of 
opcodes but also for compiler versions), but they aren't well documented, 
and semantics aren't clear.
For example, if you use the "bsfl" inline assembly instruction, you know 
what the semantics are and what the generated code is like: Intel 
documents it, and you know what code you generated. So the special cases 
like "what happens if the input is zero" are well-defined.
In contrast, the gcc builtins probably match some standard that is not 
only harder to find, but also has some _other_ definition for what happens 
for the zero case, so the builtins automatically end up having problems 
due to semantic mis-match between the CPU and the standard.
Basic rule: inline assembly is _better_ than random compiler extensions. 
It's better to have _one_ well-documented extension that is very generic 
than it is to have a thousand specialized extensions.
