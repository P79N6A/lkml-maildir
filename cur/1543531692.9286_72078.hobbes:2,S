Hi,
    I've installed and compiled the 2.3.99-pre3 kernel... I have some
troubles setting the PM modes; if I use APM I manage to halt and power down
automatically my Mandrake 7 system. But if I select ACPI, that I think I've
understood overrides APM, the system halts, a string 'Power Off' appears,
but it doesn't power off. Is it supposed to? I have a Soyo SY-6IZA
motherboard, and according to the manual, it should support ACPI. I think I
can live without ACPI, however - just a curiosity...
    Best regards,
        mano :)
