Why problematical? It's just the way how linux has always dealt with
64-bit BARs - put everything below 4G in the bus address space, on *any*
architecture. I'd be quite surprised if some firmware doesn't do the same
thing - so far I haven't heard any complaints.
Eventually we'll have to support MMIO above 4G, but I suspect this won't
be necessary at least in a next couple of years. Anyway, there are no
fundamental changes required for the generic PCI layer to handle that,
just some tweaks here and there - almost all non-trivial stuff will be
arch-specific.

Just use pci_update_resource().
John, I'd also suggest following changes to the patch:
- move the code to pci_set_power_state(), where it belongs to;
- explicitly check for D3hot->D0 transition *and* for the
  No_Soft_Reset bit, to avoid unnecessary config space accesses;
- add a quote from PCI spec (as a comment) explaining why is it needed.
Ivan.
