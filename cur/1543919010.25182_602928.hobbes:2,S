Tested-by translated into German and back into English:  "Works for me,
test methods not specified."
So, putting a Tested-by into the changelog is only useful if the
necessary testing is rather simple (i.e. "fixed the bug which I was
always able to reproduce before") or if the tester is known to have
performed rigorous and sufficiently broad tests.
