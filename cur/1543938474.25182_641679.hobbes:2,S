Well I was second generation hacker on the patchkit (after Eric B.) and
wrote quite some code in it, so yes I'm a little familiar with how it works...

No that is not its main problem I believe. Main problem are 
all the driver and other subsystem interactions (it is a little
bit similar to power management where you have lots of little
bits all over right instead of a single big one). The actual
page table handling is the smallest issue and well understood
anyways.
gbpages on the other hand does not change the driver interaction
problem at all.

I don't think gbpages has much to do with how well PAT works or not.
It is just a different way to map the large areas of the direct mapping
that do not contain any mmio or aperture mappings. These areas
are not affected by PAT. By definition (in Linux) if PAT is active
for something there are no gbpages anymore.
PAT essentially only works on areas which are already split into
4K and the gbpages code does not come into play on those at all.

Sure they can -- i did that in fact with PAT only -- my worry is just that
there is no time frame when someone will actually produce 
working PAT and then consolidated CPA. So basically my relatively
simple (and imho not very intrusive) feature is queued behind two very 
complicated projects with unclear time frame and might
be delayed forever for those.
And the rationales I so far heard for this particular prioritization
were not very convincing to say the least. Frankly I suspect Ingo 
hadn't actually looked at the gbpage code really before coming up with
it and from your comments it doesn't sound like you did either.

According to you and Ingo "the global perspective" is to get
simple stuff first in. But in this case you're doing the complicated
(and worse the unfinished) stuff first which seems to be against
your own principles.
