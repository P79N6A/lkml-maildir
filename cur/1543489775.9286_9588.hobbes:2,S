Greetings,
I know that the Linux kernel guarantees that an ISR will not be re-entered.
But does this also apply for ISR's that service more than one interrupt?
For example, if I have a driver that load-balances some data processing
between two (identical) PCI cards with different IRQ's, and data from each
controller is inserted into the same queue, do I need to lock against the
other ISR thread during queue access?  I think so, but... I would like the
confirmation of a guru. :)
thanks,
-bp
