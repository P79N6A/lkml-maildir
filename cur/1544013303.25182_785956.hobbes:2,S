hm, i just did a successful cross-build from x86 to alpha:
  KSYM    .tmp_kallsyms2.S
  AS      .tmp_kallsyms2.o
  LD      vmlinux
  SYSMAP  System.map
  SYSMAP  .tmp_System.map
  phoenix:~/linux/linux> head -6 /dev/shm/tip/build/.config 
  #
  # Automatically generated make config: don't edit
  # Linux kernel version: 2.6.28

  CONFIG_ALPHA=y
with these commits present:
  f9d1425: Disallow gcc versions 4.1.{0,1}
  f153b82: Sanitize gcc version header includes
what type of cross-build breakage do they cause?
