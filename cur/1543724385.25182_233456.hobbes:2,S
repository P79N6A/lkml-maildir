Although I am certainly hopeful I will be able to use Linux end to end
in a not too distant future :), I have to work with what I am given
today. And maybe I am not the only one in this situation ...
Please be a bit compassionate with the poor souls out there that have to
cope with Legacy OSes as build systems and/or configuration management
systems :(
Also please note that 2.4 uses to build OK on Solaris. The actual 2.6
situation is a little step-back in this matter.
