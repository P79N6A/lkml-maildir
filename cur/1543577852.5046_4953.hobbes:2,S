Hi,
	I am facing problems in loading a module under 2.2.16. The actual
kernel is 2.2.14 and it loads in it without any trouble, but when I run my 
unmodified kernel 2.2.16(I only patched the kdb patch with it and
configured with all kernel hacking options on) and try to do a insmod, it
says that it could not find the kernel the module was compiled for. I put
the CONFIG_MODVERSIONS on(ie, included modversions.h) also included the
specific version.h file. (I declared the __NO_VERSION__ before including
module.h so that it does not  include version.h). But still it does not
work. Any idea whats going wrong?
