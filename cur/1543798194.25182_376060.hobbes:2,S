Can you point me to those RFCs? Thanks!

True.
I mentioned ip / ifconfig not to imply that they are the culprit, but instead 
to expose the underlying kernel implementation.
This does not mean though, that ip / ifconfig cannot offer an emulated OSI 
compliant mode, which would be an impetus to change the underlying 
implementation.
Thanks!
