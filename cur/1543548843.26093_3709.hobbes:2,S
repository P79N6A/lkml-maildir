Both will fail for pid=1, which does not already have a controlling
terminal.

Look at his setsid() result. It is 6, so it was called from pid=6. Trust
me, it DOES NOT WORK for pid=1.
Adding a setsid() call at the very beginning of init() in init/main.c
makes pid=1 a process leader, at a time when it's still possible (no other
threads are running). After that, another kernel change can give it
/dev/console as its controlling terminal, or it can acquire the
controlling terminal itself via ioctl(0, TIOCSCTTY, 1).
