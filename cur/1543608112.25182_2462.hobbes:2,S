The expensive code in the timer interrupt will be executed every
timer interrupt! There is no magic way to connect two 32-bit long-words
to make a 64-bit object, no matter how well it's hidden by the 'C'
compiler. An increment of the low long-word won't magically bump the
high long-word. This takes code, and the simplist code to do it was
shown. This:
	adcl	$1,(jiffies)	# INCL won't set CY  4 clocks
	adcl	$0,(jiffies_hi) #                    4 clocks
... takes 8 clocks.
	This:
	incl	(jiffies)
... takes 2 clocks
Also gcc isn't as "kind" as this. It generates volumes of strange
code to bump a 'long long'.
That's 6 extra clocks every Hz or 600 clocks per second. By the time
you've reached the 497.1 days, you have wasted.... 0xffffffff/6 =
715,827,882 CPU clocks just so 'uptime' is correct?  I don't think
so. I'd reboot.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
