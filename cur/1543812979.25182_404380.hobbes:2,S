FWIW, I'd be interested in following up on something like this in
another thread because e100 appears to have (at least in one
reporter's dual e100 machine) a similar "hardware problem" where a
shared interrupt line gets asserted too early and the kernel prints a
Nobody Cared message.
So we have a new way of doing things that exposes more broken
hardware, shouldn't we provide a way for that hardware to continue
working?
