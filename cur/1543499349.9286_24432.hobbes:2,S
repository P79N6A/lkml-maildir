Oh dear, we don't still suffer from this bug do we?
If the driver supports your card, use the de4x5.o ethernet driver. It
supports a lot of boards that the tulip driver supports. We find the
driver more stable than the tulip driver (doesn't randomly drop the
network like the tulip driver does).
Maybe it's worth looking at what the tulip.c and de4x5.c do differently
