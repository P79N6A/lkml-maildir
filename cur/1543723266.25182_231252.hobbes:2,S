malloc is implemented in userspace, typically by the C library, which
uses lower-elvel mechanisms to obtain memory from the kernel.
How are you calling realloc?  It must be called thus:
    x = realloc(x, s);
since the block will have to be moved if there is no space after it
into which to expand.  Given that you allocated the block at x,
another block, and then expanded the block at x, I think this may be
what's happening.
