I tried the actual server with a stress test, and I do eventually get timeouts.
I tried with what seemed to be the best setup earlier:
pb mode
max_ia_bonus set to 0
I tried several values for base_promotion_interval but the system eventually
times out after a few hours (it's still better than it used to be, with a stock
kernel, it timeouts in less than an hour).
