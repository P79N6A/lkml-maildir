Ok, pulled, and pushed out.
And btw, I appreciate how you separately explained the fs/namei.c change, 
together with the diff for just that part. This is a prime example of how 
to make things easier for me to verify, when I see something touching a 
generic file. Thanks.
I do have a small nit: when you ask me to pull, you did:
> Please pull from 'upstream-linus' branch of
> git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mfasheh/ocfs2.git
I really prefer to see the branch-name at the end of the line (don't worry 
if it's more than 80 characters), because that way I don't make the 
mistake of cutting-and-pasting the git URL, and forgetting the branch.
So if you can update your "please pull" script to do that, I'd be even 
happier.
