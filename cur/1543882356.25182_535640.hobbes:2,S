Well, I'm willing to look at other ideas. I actually selected LRU
because it was simple. Prior to this, we did have a try at just
iterating over the pages of frozen processes, but it didn't yield enough
pages to be viable. I wouldn't be surprised if hunting down the cause of
these changing pages leads to doing the opposite - starting with LRU
pages and then removing all the ones owned by processes. (Am I right in
thinking the remainder would be anonymous pages? I must learn more mm
inards :>).
