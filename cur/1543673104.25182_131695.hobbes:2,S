Subject: [PATCH] SiS648 support for agpgart, kernel 2.4.21-rc2-ac1

This patch just adds sis648 chipset support as a generic sis chipset into
agpgart. You need it if you want to get a 3d acceleration to work.
So far it works fine on my Radeon 9000
(glxgears 1200fps instead of 300, glTron works excellent).
One thing i'm not sure is in which agp mode it is working. SiS648 as well as
R9k supports agp 3.0 but I don't think that generic sis driver does.
(correct me if i'm wrong).
