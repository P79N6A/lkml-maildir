Actually I have this identical problem with a ppp link on one of our machines. I don't think it is related to the 3c59x driver for two reasons: 1) It affects a dialup link; 2) Our adapter is an NE2000 clone. I first noticed it in 2.0.36 as well, and it's become enough of an annoyance that I'm thinking about dropping back to 2.0.34 because I can't isolate the cause.
