Not sure if you can check all interesting stuff statically.

Heh, good luck.

Like "This machine actually works" sticker? :-)

That sounds overcomplicated. Simply add this to the specs:
"BIOS must POST video during S3 wakeup. Video mujst be working
and in 80x25 text mode when it jumps to OS. VESA BIOS calls must be available to the OS."
BIOS must do that during normal boot; this should be very little additional
work.
