It isn't memory related at all.  The problem is that the X driver uses 
the video BIOS to set the display modes, instead of setting the
display mode by itself as it should.  I don't know if there are enough
docs available from intel about this but that is the problem.
I have a coworker with one of these and I tracked problem down that
far.  With agpgart the kernel allocates the rest of the memory for X
as needed.
