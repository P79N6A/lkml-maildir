Yes, that is _exactly_ what I am working on doing, and have stated as
such on this list a number of times in the past.
As for it being after the feature freeze comment, like Alan noted,
everything is already present to do this, it's just going to take some
more notifiers being added and some userspace code written.
And no, even if all of this gets done, I would not want to remove devfs
from the kernel, yet :)
