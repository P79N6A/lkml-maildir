The big problem one is the 1G/2Gig split, which causes same structures
wrong offset problems where modules do load. Once you include that you
end up needing
	1G-uni	2G-uni	1G-smp	2G-smp
SuSE I believe ship a 4G kernel setup too using the big mem patches on 2.2
so you can add
	4G-uni and 4G-smp
Im not so sure its a good idea at that point but if it handles the SMP case
it ought to handle the more dangerous 1 or 2 gig problem as well
