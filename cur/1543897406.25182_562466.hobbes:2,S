i'm missing the <sarcastic> tag i guess ;-)
<sarcastic> Oh my, does database macro-performance have any relevance to 
Linux bread and butter markets in general. Boggle, it is a really 
difficult question i suspect. </sarcastic>
If we ignore those few million database and web server Linux boxes on
the market and concentrate purely on the few m68k boxes that are still
in existance, _then_ we might be doubtful about this question ;-)

given that the cost to sys_gettimeofday() is less than a cycle (we test
a value already in a register, with an unlikely hint), and the benefit
to sys_time() is around 6000 cycles (or more), sys_gettimeofday() would
have to be used thousands of times more frequently than sys_time() -
which it clearly isnt. As a test i just triggered a really X-intense
workload and for that gettimeofday-dominated landscape there was still 1
sys_time() call for every 50 gettimeofday calls - so it's a small win
even for this X workload.
