any ABI that actually does this ?  Actually it wouldn't make sense for
an ABI to pad
struct { u16 x; u16 y; } but not pad u16 a[2];  As sizeof(a) == 2 * sizeof(u16)
in the latter case, sizeof(u16) would be != 2 ...
So, going from there, would it ever make sense for an ABI to pad
struct { u8 a; u8 b; u16 c; } ?

YM __attribute__((packed)).  And I still claim that isn't actually required
on any architecture, and just adds unnecessary gcc-specificness.
