I will fix alarm. I will also update Nigel's suspend scripts (or release 
others) that abstract the mechanism for entering sleep away from the user.

I'll get there. Give me a couple of weeks..

AFAIK, you could have
resume=/dev/hda3 always appended to your command line. Should you suspend 
and not want to resume, you should be able to manually add
"resume=" on the command line after the above, and have the setup function 
called again, which would reset it to NULL, thereby keeping the same 
semantics as "noresume", but with less namespace pollution. Anyway, I'm 
not going to do this now. I'll send you a patch if I do.

...and modify each driver to check for it? 
The decision to kill the level parameter came from extensive discussions
with Benh, who convinced me that we only need to call ->suspend() once for
any device; though we still need to somehow provide for those that need to
power down with interrupts disabled. I suggested -EAGAIN, since it allows
us to special case those that need it, with the minimum amount of impact.
Ben agreed with me.
