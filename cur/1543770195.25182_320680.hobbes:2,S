Hopefully you do not have much hardware on your PC you have to service
within very short timeframes without getting into serious trouble - if so
you need a RTOS :-) 
By not servicing you ethernet device you might loose packages - but the IP
protocols are supposed to handle that in the first place so there is no
real problem there. 
The whole point of putting it into threads is that you can decide which is
the most important: Your audio application or your slow ethernet 
device with no DMA. If the driver for the netcard is fast small enough,
run it with higher priority than your RT application, otherwise give it a
lower priority. Then if your RT application takes too much CPU you will
loose packages. You can't get both (without adding more CPUs). 
Without threading the ethernet device and giving it sufficient low
priority, somebody can DOS attack your RT application by spamming the
local network!
