This would be a bug. But I have no idea on how this is possible to happen.

Oh, well. Why do we have /dev/hda, if touching it creates a damn mess. ;)
The device node is there so userspace can access it. Yes. You can read
random data from /dev/hw_random. No problem, really, if you are aware of,
that there is _NO_ guarantee that the data returned is _really_ random.
It may just return 0xFFFFFFFF for some broken piece of overheated (or
something else) hardware.
So the suggested way to use /dev/hw_random is to let rngd access it and
put the data back into the kernel entropy buffers after verifying it.
