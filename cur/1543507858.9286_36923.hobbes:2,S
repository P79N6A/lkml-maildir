this seems pretty wimpy to me, since in the absolute worst case,
the nfs server just uses a hash table to map from random handles
onto whatever tuple is needed to specify the source block (dev:inode
or whatever).  is this an issue only because handles are of a particular
size?  I have a hard time imagining that the time or space overhead
of a hash entry per block would cause performance problems.  ah, or is
it merely that handles should persist across server restarts?

this is a yucky workaround.  it used to be a nice feature of Linux that 
you could toss random disks onto a server, and have clients remain oblivious.
