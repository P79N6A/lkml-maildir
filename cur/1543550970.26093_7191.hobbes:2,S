It would be very helpful to see the real errors, thanks.

Can't hurt.

The USB code didn't like it for some SMP motherboards a while ago.  This
should be cured now, but is a good place to start if you are having
problems.

There are patches needed for the usb-uhci.c driver, and the hub.c driver
that you are using (there also other fixes for other drivers that you
don't mention that you are using, like usbserial, visor, bluetooth, and
others, see the linux-usb.org patch manager page for these.)
I've attached the patches that you need for 2.4.0-test9.
But your response about 2.2.18pre15 also troubles me, as I have not had
any other problems mentioned about this tree.  Kernel debug messages
would greatly help out with this.
And let me know if you still have a problem with 2.4.0-test9 after
you've applied these patches.
thanks,
greg k-h
