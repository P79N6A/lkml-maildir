The correct way to fix this would be:
<in suitable header-file; suggestions welcome>
typedef flags_t unsigned long;
If someone can just come up with the proper header-file to use, I have
a patch that fixes up all (?) code.
My suggestion would be to keep the typedef in the same header-file as
save_flags/restore_flags.
