Yup.  I added linux-kernel to cc.

The consequences of this are that the application may eventually run out of
file descriptors and they will be cleaned up when the application exits
anyway, so it isn't terribly serious.
However it does seem fairly dumb of us to leave the fds open given that
at least one or possibly both of the file descriptors are unknown to the
application anyway.  Probably it'd be better to close them off immediately.
This would be an application-visible change: subsequent open()s will return
lower-numbered descriptors than they do at present.  That shouldn't matter.
