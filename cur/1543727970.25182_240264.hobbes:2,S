Yes, it still occurs with acpi=off, albeit with far less frequency.  
I've had my machine up for 1.5 hours now, ripping two CDs at a time, 
playing an AVI movie in loop, playing a bunch of MP3s, cat /allfiles 
 >/dev/null, ls -laR, running KDE with numerous KDE apps also running; 
all simultaneously.  The load is about 8, I'm 130M into swap (512M machine)
1> This would have been impossible without acpi=off.
2> Only one timeout has occured, by now several hundred would have 
normally happened
