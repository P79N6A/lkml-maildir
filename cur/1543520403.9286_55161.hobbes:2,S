For intel-32bit so far
dinx.o: 14472 bytes
Each bitdepth blitter ranges from 3k to 3.5k; only one is needed at a
time.
Performance currently resembles the old manual etch-a-sketch devices, but
that is being worked on.  Ultimately performance should be virtually the
same as using a framebuffer directly.
It doesn't add a "window manager" to the frame buffer or anything like
that.  Think of it instead as a framebuffer multiplexer; if written to use
dinx, multiple framebuffer apps can coexist happily.  Dinx does not
provide goodies like internal windows, sprites, transparency/translucency,
etc.  Those have to be done in userspace.
