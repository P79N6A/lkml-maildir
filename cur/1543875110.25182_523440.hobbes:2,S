Subject: [PATCH 00/20 take 4] UBI: Unsorted Block Images
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
This patch-set contains UBI, which stands for Unsorted Block Images. This
is closely related to the memory technology devices Linux subsystem (MTD),
so this new piece of software is from drivers/mtd/ubi.
In short, UBI provides wear-levelling support across the whole flash chip.
UBI completely hides 2 aspects of flash chips which make them very difficult to
work with:
1. wear of eraseblocks;
2. bad eraseblocks.
UBI also makes it possible to dynamically create, delete and re-size flash
partitions (UBI volumes). So here some analogy to LVM may be pointed.
There is some documentation available at:
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubi.html
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/ubi.html
The sources are available via the GIT tree:
git://git.infradead.org/ubi-2.6.git (stable)
git://git.infradead.org/~dedekind/dedekind-ubi-2.6.git (devel)
One can also browse the GIT trees at 
http://git.infradead.org/
This is the 4th iteration of the post which has fixed most of the stuff
pointed to previously:
- Removed "itsy-bitsy" units
- Removed a lot of debugging stuff
- Fixed kernel-doc
- fixed inline damage in eba.c
