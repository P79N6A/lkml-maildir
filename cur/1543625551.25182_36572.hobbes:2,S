Hi!
I've updated the equalize patch to apply on 2.4.18.
The patch also addresses two race conditions in
ip_route_input(..) and ip_route_output_key(..).
The rt_hash_table entry is only read locked although elements
from the chain can be freed if there is a matching entry with
RTCF_EQUALIZE set.
Bye,
