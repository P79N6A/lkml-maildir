Quite frankly, I'd really really rather kill the "volatile" data
structures independently. Once that is done, it doesn't really matter any
more.

No it doesn't. Not the ones on the functions that just do an inline asm.
The only valid optimization it might break is for "constant_test_bit()", 
which isn't even using inline asm.
And before we remove that "volatile", we'd better make damn sure that 
there isn't any driver that does
	/* Wait for the command queue to be cleared by DMA */
	while (test_bit(...))
		;
or similar.
Yes, it's annoying, but this is a scary and subtle area. And we sadly 
_have_ had code that does things like that.
