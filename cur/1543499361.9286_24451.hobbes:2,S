I did before I posted the message. The only prefix allowed is the REP
(repeat) prefix.  If I had a scanner, I'd send you the two pages 26-227,
26-228 of the Intel Rag, Intel 486 Microprocessor Familt Programmer's
reference manual. ISBN 1-55512-159-4.
It is the movs[bwd] string ops that can use a segment override. That's on
page 21-214 of the same rag
Cheers,
