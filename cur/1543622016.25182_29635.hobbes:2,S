To stick with that example:  CML1 knows (and tools could use that) that
CONFIG_USB_HID needs CONFIG_INPUT.  But CML1 doesn't know that you also
need at a host controller driver (CONFIG_USB_UHCI for example).  And
even if the config tool would know, it still wouldn't be able to pick
the correct one ...
