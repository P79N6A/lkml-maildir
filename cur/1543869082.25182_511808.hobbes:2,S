I repeat, that is not what "derivative work" means.  Do not try to
reason about the phrase "derivative work" without reference to its
definition in statute and its legal history in appellate decisions.
You will get it wrong every time.  You have not "recast, transformed,
or adapted" the _creative_expression_ in Bison or Flex in the course
of using it; so whether or not you have infringed the FSF's copyright,
you have NOT created a "derivative work".
If Bison and Flex were offered under the "bare" GPL, and you used them
to build a parser, and the FSF sued you for offering that parser to
other people on terms other than the GPL's, you don't defend by
claiming license under the GPL with regard to your parser.  You attack
the claim of "copying" itself by saying that the _creative_expression_
copied from Bison/Flex into your parser is "de minimis" under the
Altai Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test.  You also point out
that, even if it weren't "de minimis", it's "fair use"; that's a
complex four-factor test, but the main thing is that you're not
interfering with the FSF's ability to monetize its copyright in
Bison/Flex.
If you have any sense, you will strenuously argue that the various
"special exceptions" for things like Bison/Flex and GNU Classpath are
_not_ part of the offer of contract contained in the GPL, any more
than the Preamble is.  They're declarations of intent on the part of
the copyright holder, and can be used to _estop_ the FSF from making
the copyright infringement claim against you in court in the first
place.  They promised you they wouldn't, not as part of the contract
terms, but as part of the inducement to form a contract with them by
acceptance through conduct.

I'm sorry, but that "ratio test" has nothing to do with whether
something is a derivative work or not.  It comes up mostly in
evaluating a "fair use" defense, and it's the ratio of the amount of
creative expression _copied_ to the amount of creative expression in
the _original_work_ that matters.  Just because you're writing a
49-volume encyclopedia does not give you the right to copy two thirds
of my one-page essay.  Those weasel-words about "depending on what the
Program does" are nonsense.  It depends on what _creative_expression_
from the Program winds up in the output.

I've written tokenizers in at least six different languages to date,
including Fortran.  It's a pain in the butt.  The last thing I want to
be worrying about when I write a tokenizer is whether somebody else's
peanut butter is winding up in my chocolate.  So I will only use a
tool which, like bison and flex, is accompanied by a promise not to
claim that its output infringes the tool author's copyright or is
otherwise encumbered in any way.  M$ VC++ is actually more trustworthy
in that respect than G++.  If you don't believe (as I do) that it is
arrant nonsense to claim that the use of interface headers or linking
of any kind creates a derivative work, then you must believe that any
programs compiled with G++ can only be distributed under the terms of
the GPL.  libstdc++ is GPL, not LGPL.

That's kind of silly.  I use the GPL for my own from-scratch programs
all the time.  It's quite a sensible set of terms for source code
created as a side effect of a consulting project, when interpreted
according to real law instead of Eben Moglen's bullshit FAQ.  I don't
get paid to muck about with contract language, any more than I get
paid for turning knobs; I get paid for knowing which knob to turn.

Er, that's the preamble, which has no legal force other than as a bit
of backstory and possibly grounds for estoppel against the FSF.  It's
also obviously an artifact of the original drafting of the GPL as a
license for FSF software alone.  No judge on earth would listen to a
claim that the FSF has obtained copyright on your work without
copyright assignment papers or a "work made for hire" paper trail.

Er, you're in the crack zone here.

Personally, I don't see any reason not to use GPL or BSD (with or
without "obnoxious attribution clause") or MIT X11, other than the
ever-present danger of negligence suits due to incompetently crafted
"notice of no warranty" (it's smartest to make it clear that the only
person responsible for a failure to communicate the lack of warranty
is the person from whom the end user received the compiled program).
I don't lose sleep over that because I rarely, if ever, deliver a
binary to someone without a separate signed contract that makes the
warranty provisions crystal clear.  Avoid most other "open source"
licenses -- they frequently have booby-traps.  IANAL, TINLA.
Cheers,
