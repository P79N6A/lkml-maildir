Hi all,
We are working on the removable media support for our disk driver. 
I have a couple of questions.
How do you ask the file system to stop sending buffers to our disk driver (request function) when the media is removed?
If a disk is already mounted when the media is removed is there a way to stop all IO and umount the disk automatically?
Any pointers on the same will be of great help.
Thanks,
-Jinu
