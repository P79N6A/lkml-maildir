Hmmm... do_each_thread() does not call rcu_read_lock/unlock(), but you may
well be right.  What about kernel threads running on another CPU with
active_mm set to this mm (assuming I'm remembering correctly how that works)?
I'm not sure they'd be a problem, though.
It does sound like you've got a valid point, though.
