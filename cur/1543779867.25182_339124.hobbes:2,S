I get it. Actually, I wasn't very sure whether this is the right solution 
since my desktop machine uses tsc timer as default while the laptop the 
pmtmr. I also remember that there was a patch a while ago on lkml which 
enabled a modifiable behavior for PRINTK_TIME through a /proc interface and 
kernel boot option but it somehow didn't get accepted. Ok, then, since we 
keep the jiffies solution across arch's, how can I force the kernel to use 
tsc for printk timings so that i can see the deltas between the different 
printk's instead of the jiffies_64 ns value? The Pentium-M Centrino on the 
laptop evidently supports rdtsc as a msr instruction after testing with this 
small inline assembly snippet:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
		unsigned long long val;
		__asm__ __volatile__("rdtsc" : "=A" (val));
		printf("%llu\n", val);
		return 0;
}
