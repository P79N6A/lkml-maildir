Ok, i can see how that would be a problem ;)

Wildly untested assertion - it won't fix my case for the same reason I'm seeing
the current code not working - we abort higher up in writeback_inodes()
on the age check. All this will do is cause wb_kupdate to do one
furhter iteration down the stack until we hit the same young inode
on the s_io list. because its at the head, we return with expired
inodes zero, just like we current return with nr_to_write > 0.
i think we need to leave the inodes which we have more work to
do on on the s_io list. Alternatively, we add a new list off
the superblock (the s_more_io list) and work on that list
when we have nothing more to do or cannot do anything on
s_io or s_dirty.
That is:
	splice s_dirty -> s_io
	while s_io is not empty {
		if young, break
		writeback inode
			if inode needs more work, put on s_more_io
	}
	while s_more_io is not empty {
		writeback inode
			if inode needs more work, move to end of s_more_io
	}
That way instead of pdflush going idle because s_io has not been emptied
and can't be emptied until the inodes expire, it continues to work
on the expired inodes that need more work. And it will flush out
new inodes that have expired prior to working on the indoes that require
lots of work, so the large inode writeback does not starve other,
smaller inodes being written back.
This, combined with the change you just posted, should fix both
of the conditions mentioned.  Does this sound like a reasonable approach?
Cheers,
dave.
