Subject: [PATCH 0/4] UML - Code cleanup and I/O path fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/9/214

These are 2.6.22 material.
The first is just throwing out a pile of unused code.
The next three start to fix some rather code in UML's host file access
path.
