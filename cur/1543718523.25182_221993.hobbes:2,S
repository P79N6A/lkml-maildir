The main problem seems to be that you write much paper instead of 
simply writing and testing code.
Your approach might be a good solution for big projects, but if the 
changes are relatively simple it's not very useful.

If you'd have asked people knowing the code (e.g. by sending an email to 
linux-kernel), you'd have already known:
- the ARM port always uses -Os in kernel 2.4
- the ACPI code is always compiled with -Os in kernel 2.4
- part of the ARM port always uses -Os with "recent" gcc in
  kernel 2.2
