I just wants to point out on this list that since pre7 (or using 
pre4-acxx), I boot once out of two on my dual adaptec scsi machine.
The good news is that upgrading to more recent aic7xxx drivers fixes the 
problemas indeed the locking strategy has been changed... BTW, 2.5.68 
includes the new code also.
So I hope, it will be updated in rc2...
