containers are useful, even without migration. No doubt on that.
But, at the end, long long term probably, if we want to have a mobile
container under linux, we need to address all the issues from the start and
take them into account in the design. So, if we need to add some
constraints on the container init process (child reaper) or the resource
isolation, pid for example, to make sure a container is migratable, I think
we should start to think about it now.
By the time we reach that state, openvz would be have been rewritten a few
times already like any good software. nope ? :)

The one above.
Having containers which are not migratable because their execution
environment was not contrained enough is a pity I think.
Containers are useful for isolation but being able to swsuspend them and
migrate them is even more interesting ! and fun.

thanks for your insights ! I hope we will have plenty of these issues to
talk about.
