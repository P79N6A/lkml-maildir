Just write out a big fat kernel output with explanations of
the override parameter, possible repercusionss of not fixing it
and an email address to which you (or, better yet - Intel) want
stuff "this and that" reported.
I hadn't the slightest idea from the kernel messages or the skim of
the driver source that anyone is wanting feedback on this issue...
ps. Were there recently (2.6.22+) any known issues about e1000 refusing
to send packets out / getting stuck upon jumbo-frames being enabled?
ps2. I'm not following this list, sorry about the poor thread CC:
