Hi everyone,
I had a questions regarding a piece of code in ip_rcv_finish() function.
This function checks if there are any options in the packet. If so, it
only tries to process the Strict Source Route option.
if (opt->srr) {
	....
	if (ip_options_rcv_srr(skb))
		goto drop;
}
Can anyone please explain, why only opt->srr is being checked for and not
the other two options namely opt->rr and opt->ts.
Thanks,
Rahul.
