According to kwrohrer@ce.mediaone.net:

Of course -- seeing as how that's the usual implementation technique.
:-)  Saying that C++ is intrinsically more efficient than C is just as
ludicrous as saying that C is intrinsically more efficient than
assembler.
However, available human effort is finite.  So it's possible for a
given C++ project to end up more efficient than an equivalent C
project -- not because C++ is faster (it isn't), but because it's more
convenient.  And when grunt work is more automatic, that leaves more
time for optimizing things that are actually performance-critical.
A simple example: Working with C++'s 'string' class is a lot more
convenient and easier to verify as correct than the equivalent C
string manipulation.  Human time saved on verifying buffer lengths
etc. can be used for other issues; this is a net gain in programmer
productivity.  And yet since C++ is a superset of C, if there's any
particular thing you want to have 100% control over, C++ won't get in
your way.
(This specific example isn't relevant to kernel internals because
dynamically allocated strings aren't a staple of kernel programming.
But the principle is still applicable.)

With C++ compilers as with all other new programs, things get better
over time.  C++ compiler technology has made great strides in the last
year.  And while it's still true that EGCS, for example, is unable to
inline functions with quite the same efficiency as the equivalent
macros, this is a known issue that will be addressed reasonably soon.

Um, it enforces whatever the programmer told it to.  ("private" and
"protected" aren't just synonyms for "public".  :-))  Or did I not
get the point?

Well-said.
