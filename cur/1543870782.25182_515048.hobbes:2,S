The "assuming arbitration of access" is the key part of your
sentence ;) The problem is that currently no arbitration is done. If it
was done, then state would probably not be a problem. Most hardware
monitoring drivers don't assume any state is preserved between
accesses, and those which do can easily be changed not to. The ACPI
side is another story though, I guess we can't assume anything about
the AML code's assumption on states, as it differs from one machine to
the next. But we can try to be cooperative and restore the sensible
registers (e.g. bank selector) in the same state we found them.
Anyway, just because we can't get things right on 100% of the machines
is no reason not to try anything at all. The current situation is bad,
any improvement would be welcome.

Is there anything preventing us from doing such a walk and pre-allocate
all the I/O ranges? I am not familiar with the ACPI code at all, would
you possibly propose a patch doing that?
If we can't do that, the overestimation approach might still work. I
wonder if it would cause problems in practice. If it does, we're back
to Pavel's AML lock.
