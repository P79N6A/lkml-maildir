Thanks, someone sent me the source tarball of version 0.56 and
I've got it installed and working great now.  It would indeed be
nice if the project was on sourceforge and easy to find.
What would be even nicer is if the author did any required
cleaning to the patch and submitted it to
Rusty/Alan/Linus/whoever for kernel inclusion along with other
modules already there.  ;o)
