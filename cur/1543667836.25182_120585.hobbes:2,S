Probably you are hit by
  dev_t-32-bit.patch
    [for playing only] change type of dev_t
This is hidden somewhat in the 100+ patches in -mm,
but the kernel is not quite ready yet - that is
why this is labeled "not to be applied, for
playing only". Mostly things work, but some stuff
related to lvm, md, dm, nfs, loop will break
because ioctls use structs with a dev_t field.
You can revert this single patch and probably all will be fine.
More interesting would be to apply
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103956089203199&w=3
if possible, and see whether that helps.
You can see some earlier discussion today under a subject
containing the word dm_ioctl.
