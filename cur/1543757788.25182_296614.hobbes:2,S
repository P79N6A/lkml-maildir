Yes, that'll happen.  Because there are still buffers attached to the page
which have the wrong blocksize.  Say, if someone is trying to read a 2k
buffer_head which is backed by a page which already has 1k buffer_heads
attached to it.
Does your kernel not have that big printk in __find_get_block_slow()?  If
it does, maybe some of the buffers are unmapped.  Try:
