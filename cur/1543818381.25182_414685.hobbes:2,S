OK.  FWIW I am looking at the emu10k1 driver (though I've seen this in
others).  The OSS driver has this comment:
    /*
     ** NOTE :
     ** We do a 'while loop' here cos on certain machines, with both
     ** playback and recording going on at the same time, IRQs will
     ** stop coming in after a while. Checking IPND indeed shows that
     ** there are interrupts pending but the PIC says no IRQs pending.
     ** I suspect that some boards need edge-triggered IRQs but are not
     ** getting that condition if we don't completely clear the IPND
     ** (make sure no more interrupts are pending).
     ** - Eric

The ALSA driver preserves the while loop but omits the comment :-/
