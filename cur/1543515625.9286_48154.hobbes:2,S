I also get access beyond device on my ftp-server.
I've had it 3 times now. The computer totaly locks up...
Can't do anything without a hard-reset. (on/off power :)
I used a clean 2.2.5 kernel that came with RedHat.
I use the server as an ftp mainly with a lot of i/o on the HD ;-)
I have two 16 GB HD on the server. (IDE)
No SCSI at all in the kernel.
Now I have uppgraded to 2.3.26 and I'll get back to you if I get it 
again.
When I do a cat /proc/ioports i get:
e000-e00f : VIA Technologies VT 82C586 Apollo IDE
Could it be the VIA chip that's causing all the trouble?
I know Cox and the others are working on it :)
