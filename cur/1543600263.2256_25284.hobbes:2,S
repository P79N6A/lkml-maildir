Seems like you may have lost five bucks... When ACPI is enabled the sci is
on IRQ 9, while the CardBus controller is on a IRQ 11 along with
the Sound card, the ethernet card, the modem and the usb controller. The
SCI seems to go to irq 9... and be alone there...  The bug does not happen
when acpi is enabled tho... So I can't confirm...

Where would that loop occur?
