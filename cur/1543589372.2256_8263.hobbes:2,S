Since the official aic7xxx site doesn't carry a patch against 2.4.4 yet
(just 2.4.3) which has cosmetic issues when being patched, I made a
patch against 2.4.4: I took the 2.4.3-aic7xxx-6.1.12 patch, applied to
2.4.4, bumped the version to read -ma1 in EXTRAVERSION, and made a new
patch against vanilla 2.4.4, to be found at:
*** WARNING BELOW ***
http://mandree.home.pages.de/kernelpatches/v2.4/v2.4.4/
 72k linux-2.4.4-aic7xxx-to-6.1.12.patch.gz
Apply with patch -p1.
NOTE: Do not expect this patch to last until after either Justin has a
patch against 2.4.4 available or 2.4.5 has been released.
*** WARNING *** I did not yet try to boot it, that will have to wait
until later.
