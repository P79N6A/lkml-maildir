Yes, you can. Just you have to take care never to occupy too much
memory.

It's not that easy. How do you tell when the page is no longer likely to
get cleaned?
The file backing would be easier, but to be really easy, the interface
would be a bit different (and actualy simpler, since it would need no
data channel, just a control one).
The trick is, that the coda file-granularity interface is not that hard
to extend to page-granularity. Several filesystems allow "files with
holes". So the fuse process could just touch a file and truncate it to
desired length on open. Then kernel would tell it which pages it wants
and the process would acknowledge when they are actualy filled. For
write, kernel would just notify the process of dirty ranges and what --
and when -- the process does with that is not kernel's business.
The legacy interface should still be easy to support in a library.
