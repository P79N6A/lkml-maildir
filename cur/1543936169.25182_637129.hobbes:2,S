There has been more than 90K worth of changes to the files you are
changing since 2.6.20
It is generally unwise to submit patches against such old kernel
versions, they rarely apply, so please respin your patch against more
current sources.
Please also remove the trailing whitespace, like the one found
here:
+#define	IN_CLASSE_HOST		(0xffffffff & ~IN_CLASSE_NET)
+
+/* 
   ^^^^^
Thanks.
