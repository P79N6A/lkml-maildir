Hi all, 
   this mail is to tell you about an half-success. I am trying to run a
2.6.1 (stock) kernel with my vaio pgc-fx701 laptop running Mandrake 9.2.I am
in the phase of trying to have the suspend option working. The stock kernel
swsusp "almost" work: it suspend the laptop, it resume it almost ok: but
neither usb mouse nor alsa works in the resumed machine. Ethernet works. 
    I read on the kernel-list archive of the possibility of unload/reloading
the drivers on resume, but I have another problem: compiling the "module
unloading" option in the kernel make kudzu generate an oops at early boot
stage. 
    So, before continuing: can I help with debugging? Or all these problems
are  well-known and simply I have to wait for the 2.6.2 kernel? If you need
the above-mentioned early oops, tell me; I will try to reproduce it and copy
it by hand (it was not so long; EIP was invalid, so...) 
    Romano
