But that's not race free on SMP. Two CPUs can set the bit in parallel
and you'll never notice. You would need at least a protecting spinlock 
between the test bit and set bit (or a cmpxchg on x86)

That also does not help for protecting your objects, it only protects
the wait queue.

The processes look it up in a shared name table (shmem). Yes they have 
to negoitate in this case -- it'll only be a win when they usually do not
share.

Probably, it is a DoS.
