I'd love to have Nigel helping me and kernel, but he's not
interested. He wants suspend2 merged, he does not want better suspend
in kernel.

I do not think he's paid for suspend2 any more.

Nigel is not really maintaining it. He's willing to solve small
problems, but not the big ones.

uswsusp and swsusp share most of the important code (go take a
look). No, in-kernel swap writing is not going to be improved too
much, just the bugs fixed. That means very stable swsusp in kernel...

Fine, feel free to help with answering users mails.
