Yes, you program 0x42 which is independant,
but, unless I am missing something, you also
touch 0x43 and 0x61, which are not, and so I
thought it would be better to just use the
i8253_lock alltogether. And it doesn't look
like the lock is held during the entire beep,
so it probably doesn't really make anything
to wait for too long. What am I missing?

I am not sure, I thought I can't. I looked at
the code and it seems input_event() would call
the dev->event() regardless, and only at the
bottom - dev->grab->handler->event().
While it seems like I want to prevent the
dev->event() from being called, at the first
place. And it doesn't look like the grab
functionality is described in
Documentation/input at all, and no examples
around the code that I could use. So I just
don't know what functionality is that...
Will try to play around it and maybe I'll
figure something out:)

Is it just a problem of the name (i.e.
would the SND_STOP be better), or is it
conceptually wrong? (I guess for both:)

OK. I'll try to find the better solution.
Let's just apply the first patch then - it is a
cleanup, I don't think it could do any harm.
