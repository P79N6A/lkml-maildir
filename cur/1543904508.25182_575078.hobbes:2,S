This results in an ARM-only driver in an X86-only menu...
What about the patch below instead that also improves a few other things?
<--  snip  -->
This patch contains the following changes to the DMA engine menus:
- switch to menuconfig
- INTEL_IOATDMA must depend on X86
- INTEL_IOATDMA must select DCA
- device drivers shouldn't "default m"
- DCA shouldn't be a user visible option
- make it clear in the INTEL_IOATDMA help text that this driver is for
  rare hardware the user most likely doesn't has
- let DMA_ENGINE be select'ed by the DMA devices, making it less likely
  for a user to accidentally enable NET_DMA
