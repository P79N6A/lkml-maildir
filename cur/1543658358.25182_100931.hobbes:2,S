I saw that this mail did not connect to the right
thread, so to recap: With this hdd as master on my
second IDE channel, 2.4.20 hangs at the partition
check, a backtrace:
lock_page
read_cache_page
read_dev_sector
handle_ide_mess
msdos_partition
check_partition
grok_partitions
register_disk
ide_geninit
ide_init
blk_dev_init
device_init
do_initcalls
There is a primary msdos partition on this drive that
use the entire disk, but I also tried with a clear
partition table. 2.2 slackware bootdisk is fine, DOS is
fine in using the hdd. If anybody wants more info, just
tell me what to do. Im not on the list so reply to me
if so. I also tried lots of IDE patches but didnt help.
Any specific kernel versions or kernel options I should
try/disable/enable?
