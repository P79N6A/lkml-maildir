Subject: [PATCH 1/5] Mark bio_alloc() allocations correctly
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/17/88

bio_alloc() currently uses __GFP_MOVABLE which is plain wrong. Objects are
allocated with that gfp mask via mempool. The slab that is ultimatly used
is not reclaimable or movable.
