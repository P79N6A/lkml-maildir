I applied your little patch "vmscan.patch.2.4.17.c" to a plain 2.4.17
source tree, recompiled, and tried it. Swap usage is _much_ less than in
original 2.4.17: hardware is a Pentium166 with 64 MB RAM and 75 MB
swap, and my workload includes X 4.1.x, icewm, nightly Mozilla, several
rxvt, gkrellm, some MP3 listening via XMMS, xchat, several links web
browsers and a couple of little daemons runnig.
I have not done scientific measures on swap usage, but with your patch
it seems caches don't grow too much, and swap is usually 10-20 MB lower
than using plain 2.4.17. I have also observed in /proc/meminfo that
"Inactive:" seems to be much lower with your patch.
If someone wants more tests/numbers done/reported, just ask.
Hope this helps.
