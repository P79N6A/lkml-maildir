I've been looking all over but could not find it. Also I've checked the newest linux kernel builds and there is no mention of mv_61x support. Does anyone know the status of kernel support for this chip? I'm running 2.6.17 kernel currently but will be upgrading to .18 on Thursday (FC5)

This chip is vastly different from sata_mv.
For the SATA portion (not PATA), you might have some luck adding your 
PCI ID to ahci.c.  Give that a try, and let us know if it works or 
explodes :)
Other than that, no progress at all to report.  Marvell just provided 
the documentation to me, but I've made no progress yet.
