Great, thanks a lot. Your tests are very interesting for us as we haven't done 
any gigabit or SMP tests yet.

Since real world network traffic always consists of a lot of different sized 
packets taking maximum sized packets is very euphemistic. 1450 byte packets 
at 950 Mbit/s correspond to approx. 80,000 packets/sec.
We are really interested in how our algorithm performs at higher packet rates. 
Our performance tests are based on 100 Mbit hardware so we coudn't test with 
more than approx. 80,000 packets/sec even with minimum sized packets. At this 
packet rate we were hardly able to drive the algorithm to its limit, even 
with more than 25000 rules involved (and our test system was 1.3 GHz 
uniprocessor).
We'd appreciate it very much if you could run additional tests with smaller 
packet sizes (including minimum packet size). This way we can get an idea of 
whether our SMP optimizations work and whether our algorithm in general would 
benefit from further fine tuning.
