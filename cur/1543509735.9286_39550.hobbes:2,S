And I'm going to do AFFS part - I had to touch it anyway (it has a fairly
nasty races in the metadata part: unlink in one directory may reshuffle
the entries in another; find_entry() is not protected against that and
there are further races). Wrt the data part AFFS can copy new FAT.
Unfortunately that will not work for that OFS abortion. Quite probably
OFS will become a roadkill.
	ObAFFS: do we really need to support links to directories? It
breaks quite a chunk of VFS and I would like to know how often they are
really used.
	I'll start sending the patches as soon as I'll port the stuff to
.18-ac*.
	QNX should be trivial - it looks like a UNIX fs.
