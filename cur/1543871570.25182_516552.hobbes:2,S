Hmm.. It doesn't look *wrong*, but could you please
 - split it up a bit (some of it is 100% obvious, ie the comment fixes)
 - write an explanation for the individually split up patches
 - not use attachments, but just make it inline. It's practically 
   impossible to reply and quote part of the patch now.
Eric/Ingo - did you go through and check the patch?
Thanks,
		Linus
