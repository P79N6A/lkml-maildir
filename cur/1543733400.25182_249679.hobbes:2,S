linux-kernelhi:
	I met a kernel BUG at slab.c , exactly at here:
			down(&cache_chain_sem);
			{
				struct list_head *p;
				list_for_each(p,&cache_chain){
					kmem_cache_t *pc=list_entry(p,kmem_cache_t,next);
					if(!strcmp(pc->name,name))
						BUG();
				}
			}
	I also print the pc->name and name to the terminal, the pc->name is files_cache, certainly the name is files_cache.
 
     the version is linux-2.4.19
	Would you please give some advice about the cause of the Kernel BUG?
	Maybe I haven't give you enough information, but I really don't know what message I should give, please tell me, 
	and I will post them .
	 Any suggestion will be appreciated.
	Thank you .
