Sounds like one of the partitions that has the executable script loader is
mounted with "noexec". 
On most systems, /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit is a bash script, and explicitly
points to /bin/bash. Check "ldd /bin/bash", and verify that all the
libraries (and /bin itself, of course) are mounted on executable
filesystems.
That would be a bug that 2.6.0 uncovers.
