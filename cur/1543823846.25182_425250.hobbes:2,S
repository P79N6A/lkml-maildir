Hi,
Thank you for the assistance. Which parameters do you suggest changing? 
  TSO/flow control off?
Here is my ruleset for those interested:
# iptables -t raw -L -v
Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 27441 packets, 4832K bytes)
  pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source 
destination
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 195M packets, 156G bytes)
  pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source 
destination
1332K  144M NOTRACK   !tcp  --  any    any     anywhere 
anywhere
    54  5293 ACCEPT     tcp  --  any    any     anywhere 
anywhere            tcp dpt:7373
  4564  223K ACCEPT     tcp  --  any    any     anywhere 
anywhere            tcp dpt:7322
  194M  156G NOTRACK    tcp  --  any    any     anywhere 
anywhere            tcp dpt:!7373
  194M  156G NOTRACK    tcp  --  any    any     anywhere 
anywhere            tcp dpt:!7322
# iptables -t nat -L -v
Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 2114 packets, 155K bytes)
  pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source 
destination
Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT 2114 packets, 155K bytes)
  pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source 
destination
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
  pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source 
destination
     6   344 DNAT       tcp  --  eth0   any     anywhere 
anywhere            tcp dpt:7373 to:host.ip.address:443
     8   408 DNAT       tcp  --  eth0   any     anywhere 
anywhere            tcp dpt:7322 to:host.ip.address:22
iptables -L -v just shows 2 rules per Virtual Machine for accounting. 
This averages about 100 rules in the FORWARD chain.  Example:
# iptables -L -v
Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 195M packets, 156G bytes)
  pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source 
destination
     0     0            all  --  any    any     xx.xx.xx.xx 
  anywhere
     0     0            all  --  any    any     anywhere 
xx.xx.xx.xx
