I have a technical problem with marker-based RCU tracing: It causes
nasty recursions with latest multi-probe marker patches (sorry, no link
at hand, can be found in latest LTTng, maybe also already in -mm). Those
patches introduce a marker probe trampoline like this:
void marker_probe_cb(const struct marker *mdata, void *call_private,
	const char *fmt, ...)
{
	va_list args;
	char ptype;
	/*
	 * rcu_read_lock does two things : disabling preemption to make sure the
	 * teardown of the callbacks can be done correctly when they are in
	 * modules and they insure RCU read coherency.
	 */
	rcu_read_lock();
	preempt_disable();
	...
Can we do multi-probe with pure preempt_disable/enable protection? I
guess it's fine with classic RCU, but what about preemptible RCU? Any
suggestion appreciated!
Jan
PS: You will run into this issue if you try to marry latest -rt with
latest LTTng. Straightforward workaround is to comment-out any RCU
trace_mark occurrences.
