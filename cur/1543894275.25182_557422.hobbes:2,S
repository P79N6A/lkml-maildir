In *YOUR* opinion and by *YOUR* definition of the term. Yes, I have seen some 
evidence that TiVO hasn't made some of the modifications they made public - 
doesn't mean that they won't, just it hasn't *YET* been done. (Not that I'm 
so omniscient I can say, definitively, whether they will or won't - or even 
that they haven't done it already).
By my own definition replacement != modification.

The same as I would with a TiVO. I have the right to copy, modify, distribute 
and run the code - even if I can't do any of those things on the hardware the 
original binary operates on.

Simple: I don't buy it. Each and every piece of hardware I buy has a rather 
laborious research process before I actually spend the money on it. This 
makes it a certainty that I can use the hardware in the manner I want without 
problems like your hypothetical.
Whats worse - forcing your morals and ideals on someone or giving them the 
same freedom of choice you had?
Before you answer remember that that is *EXACTLY* what is being done with 
GPLv3. With GPLv2 and prior there was a simple guarantee that 
every "Licensee" had exactly the same rights. With GPLv3 you are forcing your 
ethics and morals on people - and isn't this exactly what the Roman Catholic 
church did during the Spanish Inquisition?

Bzzt! Wrong! The reason is that it wasn't necessary - at all. It still isn't, 
but a group that feels modification == replacement wants it to be, so it has 
suddenly become necessary. (Note that anti-DRM stuff *IS* good - DRM is part 
of an attempt by failing business models to stop the failure)

Ah, but I never said I had a GPLv1 program. If GPLv1 is still valid and 
available I should be able to find a copy of it *RIGHT* *NOW* to license a 
new project if I want to use GPLv1 as its license. So your logic is again 
flawed.

Yes, they do. It isn't a right they have as "copyright holders" - in fact, it 
isn't a part of their rights under the copyright at all. It's a part of their 
rights as the owners of the network.

Never claimed it was less obscure, just that you've usually got a board-room 
filled with middle-aged men that might have problems agreeing that it is a 
clear-cut case.

Yes, but the fact that it would cost money to get the suit dropped is a 
problem.

Doesn't matter what the author intended it to mean - at all. What matters is 
how its interpreted when/if it shows up in court. This can be seen *ALL* the 
time with laws across the globe. In the US there is this thing called 
the "RICO" Laws- "Racketeering Influenced Criminal Organization" - that give 
the government the ability to seize anything that is deemed a "profit of drug 
sales" or of a "Criminal Organization". It has been used for that purpose, 
but its interpretation has caused it to be used to seize money that has had 
no source in either.
