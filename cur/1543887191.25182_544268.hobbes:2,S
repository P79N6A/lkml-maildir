Hello everybody,
If this is the wrong place to ask, please tell me where to ask instead.
I have ext3 filesystems with labels on devicemapper crypted devices. These do 
not show up in /dev/disk/by-label/, in contrast to filesystems of my "real" 
partitions. Is this the expected behaviour or what could go wrong?
