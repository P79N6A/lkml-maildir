Hi experts,
I have almost 620000 bytes data store in Kernal space
and would like to pass to user space via mmap.
Can I use the kmalloc to allocate 5 memory chucks
(4096*30) and then use remap_page_range() to map those
5 chucks one by one? it not seems to work. Anyone can
tell me if it's feasible? or I have to use vmalloc?
Now I only can mmaped the first chuck buffer and make
it work.
Since I'm not in the user group list, please send
directly email to me.
Thanks your help in advance!
-Lan
