Partial? Elaborate please. And talk about OSS drivers in 2.6 kernel.

Nope. You're missing that dmix does not add any extra latencies, because
samples are written directly to the DMA buffer.

Sorry, but you have limited resources (CPU power). It's completely 
irrelevant, if you do processing in the user space or in kernel (in my 
opinion it's even worse to do such things in the interrupt context).
It's probably better to think how to instruct scheduler to wake up
the sound applications as soon as possible.

??? Elaborate. It should work.

I would prefer probably a network lowlevel ALSA driver. You'll get the 
network transparency as benefit.

Unfortunately, more functionality requires more code. You have to deal 
with bloating the user or kernel space.
