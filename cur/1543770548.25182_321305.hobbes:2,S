Have to rewrite them.... Well, there are obviously none written for
Linux today, because it doesn't support hard-RT ;)
If you are talking about soft-RT, or things running on Linux today,
then sure they'll keep working. Even some or all of PREEMPT_RT may
be merged into the Linux guest too, for better soft-RT. I haven't
been arguing against that.

Actually this is exactly what was being talked about. But note
that we're not specifically talking about PREEMPT_RT here, just
2 possible architectures that might achieve that.

I agree we'll never have a fully functional hard-RT Linux kernel.
But this thread hasn't been about whether or not the RT task knows
what it is doing (we assume it does), but the possibility of making
more parts of the kernel able to provide some RT guarantee (ie. so
said RT task *can* use more functionality).
