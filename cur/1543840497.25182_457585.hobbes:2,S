NACK.  Again a simple s/kernel_thread/kthread_run/ is not what we
need, you need to rething whats going on.  And the thread usage in
lcs is really bad :)
I'm not even sure why it creates all these short-lived threads,
but to fix this mess we might need a new function in kthread.c
that start a thread asynchronously so we can kill all the
workqueue mess in the various s390 net drivers and some other
places.
I'd suggest to start with getting a coherent description of what
those threads actually try to solve from the driver maintainer.
