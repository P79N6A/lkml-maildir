Agreed.

Yes, Linus has recently written that he prefers that style also.
The problem (to me at least) is that this patch:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=e659ba4a0d2d471c0d73590f78e1a1b5a1eede48
was not discussed before it was merged.  It was discussed a little bit
after it was merged.  Basically we have no concensus on this patch,
just a dictate (which we can all live with).
