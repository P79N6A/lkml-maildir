Oh, that's good news for me.
I was receiving more and more complains about this kind of issues.
I feel this is really a good answer to the typical "page cache ate all my 
node memory" case, which is *really* a pain for many HPC apps that access 
large files.
Thanks Paul.

I'm not sure about the 'ill-advised' part. All our efforts to let the 
kernel do the Right Thing by himself on all situations should not prevent 
us from remembering that Linux is not a time machine, and that sometimes, 
it is just a lot easier and probably better to give the kernel a few hints 
about what it should do.
And even if this can seem 'specific', this kind of workload is NOT rare, 
at least in HPC.
