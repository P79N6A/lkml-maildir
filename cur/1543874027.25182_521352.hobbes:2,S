Well, if somebody could explain what they should do instead of what they're 
doing, I can contact them - the libraries for KDE 4 aren't in feature freeze 
yet (they will be, though) so they can solve the problem(s). The KIO 
infrastructure is ATM under a redesign, so please, if you know what they 
should do/are doing wrong, speak up!
