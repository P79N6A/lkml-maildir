To see "Lock ordering:" in mm/filemap.c
I tell you an example of this used big kernel lock
write_lock_irq/write_unlock_irq:
     void __remove_from_page_cache(struct page *page):
      * Remove a page from the page cache and free it. Caller has to make
      * sure the page is locked and that nobody else uses it - or that usage
      * is safe.  The caller must hold a write_lock on the mapping's tree_lock.
     void remove_from_page_cache(struct page *page) {
	     struct address_space *mapping = page->mapping;
	     BUG_ON(!PageLocked(page));
	     write_lock_irq(&mapping->tree_lock);
	     __remove_from_page_cache(page);
	     write_unlock_irq(&mapping->tree_lock);
     }
     * Shared mappings 30.11.1994, 15.8.1995  Bruno.
     * 'unifying' the page and buffer cache and SMP-threaded the
        page-cache, 21.05.1999, Ingo Molnar.
     * SMP-threaded pagemap-LRU 1999, Andrea Arcangeli.
Here doesn't say multiple SMP buffers of pages for SMP.
For UP, no SMP buffer is needed.

Don't hate to me, you've not reasons to insult me or to somebody.
To think of the proposals posted by any person, not of me.

You're contradictory. It uses BKL or slower spinlocks/rwlocks in allocator.
It shares the crucial resource.
The physical RAM of the SMP system is a shared resource for 2 or more CPUs
(even in NUMA systems), so to avoid the race conditions, it needs to be
temporaly locked to comply the mutual exclusion of this shared resource.
I'm saying that it will try to reduce the frequency of BKLs to maximize the
OS performance in the mind of Huffman (freq.) & Amdhal (hot code).
I don't understand you saying "to share your crack pipe", what means it?
Nothing is crack. It's not an unix pipe. It's 8 local SMP buffers for 8 CPUs.

Don't point me! Don't menace me!
I know how to work internally a monolithic O.S., so i'm not googling papers from
others and i'm thinking from my brain how to work a little better some things
that i proposed.

You're a distractor man that distracts to the people.
