No, I have only a patch for 2.5 kernel.
But, RedHat AdvancedServer2.1(2.4.9based kernel) has a similar parameter
(/proc/sys/vm/pagecache). If you can see the source, please check it.

I'm not a specialist in VM, too. So, that patch may have many bugs.
What is done in that patch is very simple.
1) Add PG_pgcache flag to the page used as pagecache.
2) Watch the total amount of pagecahe.
3) If the amount of pagecahe exceeds maximum,
   try to remove only the page which has PG_pgcache flag.
Thanks.
