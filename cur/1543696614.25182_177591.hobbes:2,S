   I will reply on behalf of Linus: "Send patch!"
   I beleive you are not developer - so you even cannot estimate what 
you are proposing.
   This kind of patch will never be accepted.
   Just try to imagine: 20 file systems, so 20*20 == 400 ifs?
   So I beleive you will get more more positive responses, If you will 
start improveing vfs, e.g. adding generic routines for optimized move of 
file from one file system to another, with API which allow it to 
extrapolate nicely to networked file systems.
   Since right now there is no way to pass file from one fs to another - 
so basicly this thread is already, well, over ;-)

    Silly. cp is least frequent application I use.
    And cvs I beleive already uses sendfile().
    So all your /arguments/ go directly into /dev/null, since if file is 
not in cvs - you know - it just doesn't exist ;-)))
