Just thaought I'd let you know about my experiences with Mandrake using
the 2.4 and 2.6 kernels on my new hardware which is primaraly a Asus
A7V600 (KT600) Motherboard and Radeon 9600XT
Under 2.4 my ATA hard drak is mounted under /dev/hda where as under 2.6
is /dev/hde so there is no wasy way to switch between them with lilo and
/etc/fstab needing to be changed
My gigabit lan isn't deteced at all under 2.4 is works but with errors
in 2.6 (I've tried building the 2.4 mdoule for it but it crashes the
whole system)
Agpgart in 2.4 isn't new enough to cope with the KT600 motherboard in
2.6 it is but the fglrx driver won't compile properly using it so either
way no kewl 3D graphics (oh and it only works in 2D mode if I'm using
Xfree86 4.3) if I use the older Alt driver I can get it to work with 4.4
but still without 3D
My webcam (cpia usb) is detected and works perfectly under 2.4 in 2.6 it
simply doesn't appear at all.
My DVB card works perfectly in 2.4 however under 2.6 /dev/dvb is totally
empty after modprobing the correct drivers (tda1004x frontend)
So I'm kinda caught in the middle here. I don't have a fully working
system no matter which kernel I use
Has anyone had any sililar experiences or found some solutions
Mike
