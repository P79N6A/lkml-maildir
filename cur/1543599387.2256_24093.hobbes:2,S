To add another datapoint to Martin Mueller's observation, the 
 > Aug 21 15:01:33 cicero kernel: ymfpci_codec_ready: codec 0 is not ready [0xffff]
codec frozen problem after suspend/restore is also broken in 2.4.9-pre4.  
Ergo, it's in the other three prepatches after 2.4.8.
It's also still broken in 2.4.10-pre1.
