Hi,
I think I may have found a clue in the bezerk keyboard/mouse
problem. I found it before, but just did not think about it :(
When the bezerk mouse thing happens, the mouse appears to move
in random directions, but when looking at the keyboard variant
closely, you'll see that it's not random at all.
It just repeats the information found in other places in the
ring buffer -- never leaving the ring buffer for garbage memory,
but just being confused about it's own whereabouts in the ring
buffer.
Now could that mean that a pointer inside the ring buffer was
incremented twice, going to just _in front_ of where new data
is deposited?  (or something like that)
Rik
