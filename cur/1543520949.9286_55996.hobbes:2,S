This one is simple: you are  using the wrong driver here, use the 53c8xx
driver (it's the next in the selection list) the 53c7,8xx driver is just
there for 53c7xx EISA controller also it might work on some 53c8xx PCI
controllers as well. 
Choose 53c8xx driver and everything should work, at least it does on my
Multia...
