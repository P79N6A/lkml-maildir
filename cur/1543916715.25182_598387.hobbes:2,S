What is your problem Rob?
I think message numbers are difficult to produce from format strings.
I think kernel version/file/func/line is enough to identify messages
for normal use but not too useful for embedded.
I think losslessly compressing, not hashing, the format string
would be useful.  The format string would be expanded by printk.
The kernel size would be smaller and more easily fit in minimal RAM.
Losslessly compressing the format strings probably won't reduce
flash image size.
cheers, Joe
