Indeed, that's precisely what's happening. I'm walking one page past
the end of userspace. 
And the reason is I changed my walker from using for loops to do/while
loops at Nick's insistance, so start==end no longer gets noticed
immediately. This also explains why the bug doesn't manifest in
lguest: no PSE mappings.
Thanks, guys!
