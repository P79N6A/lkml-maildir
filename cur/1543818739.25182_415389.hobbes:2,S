I see. Kind of the opposite of what I thought they were, but it
makes sense. Thanks.

I dunno how raw this is, but chp_measurement_copy_block and
chp_measurement_read (in drivers/s390/cio/chsc.c) sure look like
passing structures, in 2.6.17-rc1. However, the code does not interpret
the structures, so maybe it's raw enough.
