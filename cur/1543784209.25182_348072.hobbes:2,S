Thanks.

The legacy platform device (serial8250_isa_devs) is for the old
legacy ISA tables, found in include/asm-*/serial.h.
Other serial8250 platform devices can be used to register other
devices - preferably groups of platform specific serial ports.
However, if you're talking about registering a set of devices
found on a different bus type (eg, PCI) then look at how 8250_pci
handles that.  I'd prefer bus-specific device registration to be
done in a similar way to 8250_pci rather than creating extra
platform devices.
I hope that's clear.
