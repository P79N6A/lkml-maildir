Can you be specific about which changes to existing mainline code were
needed to make recursive reclaim "work" in your tests (albeit less
ideally than peterz's patchset in your view)?
Also, in a previous post you stated:

Which changes allowed you to address 1?  I had a look at the various
patches you provided (via svn) and it wasn't clear which subset
fulfilled 1 for you.  Does it work for all Block IO and not just
specially tuned drivers like ddsnap et al?
