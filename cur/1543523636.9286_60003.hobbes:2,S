(activation record == prologue?)
You mean this script right?
#!/bin/sh
# cd /usr/src/linux or wherever you keep the source
objdump --disassemble vmlinux modules/*.o | \
sed -ne '/>:/{s/[<>:]*//g; h; };
 /sub.*$0x[^,][^,][^,].*,%esp/{
 s/.*$0x\([^,]*\).*/\1/; G; s/\(.*\)\n.* \(.*\)/\1 \2/; p; };
 /sub.*%.*,%esp/{ G; s/\(.*\)\n\(.*\)/Dynamic \2 \1/; p; }; ' | \
