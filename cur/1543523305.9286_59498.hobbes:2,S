There are plenty of cases where it is used without __init. However, now
that I hear Jeff's idea of GFP_ZERO flag to kmalloc() I agree that it is
superiour. There is no need to invent (and export) a new function (with a
funny name as well) where the old one will suffice. Also, it saves an
extra function call.
