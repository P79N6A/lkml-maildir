You're assuming there is some meaningful relationship between changes in 
cpu/mem/ctxt performance and these tunables, which isn't the case. 
Furthermore if this was the case, noone understands it, can predict it or 
know how to tune it. Just saying "autotune it" doesn't really tell us how 
exactly the change those tunables in relation to the other variables. Since 
Mike and I understand them reasonably well I think we'd both agree that there 
is no meaningful association.
Cheers,
Con
