That's one approach. Unfortunately, it's not what the kernel currently
does. The root of the problem is -- it needs to copy the data, even if
the kernel can access userspace data. There are many reasons for why
this is a simpler way to program the interface; if you want actual
concrete examples, let me know.
In order to accomplish the copy_from_user() procedure, from the i386
perspective, the kernel first figures out where userspace is telling it
to look for the data buffer. It checks if the LAST page belongs to
userland, and fails if not; this works because the kernel sits in higher
memory. Then it simply does the direct copy. If during the copy it hits
an invalid page, the exception handler code will run, realize that the
exception occurred because of the copy, and return an error code right
then and there.
Lots of details left out, but this is the 10,000 foot view, I think.
