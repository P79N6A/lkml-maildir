I just downloaded and installed kernel 2.2.0-pre8, but the kernel
fails with detecting my LS-120 drive, wich worked well in version
2.2.0-pre7.
2.2.0-pre7 says:
hdc: LS-120 VER4 07 UHD Floppy, ATAPI FLOPPY drive
and 2.2.0-pre8 says:
hdc: LS-120 VER4 07 UHD Floppy, ATAPI CDROM drive
It seems like the kernel identifies my floppydrive as a CDROM, and
later fails to mount the floppy.
