It seems the problem is not caused by ntpd. 
The issue is still there after I stopped the ntpd daemon. I tested it
for a long time and found the clock drifted around every 1 second. The
distances of the clock drift are interleaved with both positive and
negative values. For example, if it goes 300ms forward, it will go
backward around 300ms at the next time. Because the occurrences of the
clock drift are so regular, I doubt it was caused only by one source.  I
am still wondering how I can discover it. 
	There were also 2 other suggestions I got from here the last
week. I will try them to see if it can solve my problem. 
	Thanks. 
Regards,
Liangchen

Well, if you are running ntpd on all of the machines (and not just
periodically running ntpdate), it should slew the clock gradually, so
you should not see any big jumps.
If all machines are running ntpd locally, and all are configured to use
the same NTP server, all clocks should be in sync all the time.
