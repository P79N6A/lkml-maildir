You are making the same mistake I did when I saw the patch.
This is the _MTRR_ setting, not the microcode loading.
They both had the same issues with HT - and the microcode fix was indeed
just to make sure that the microcode hadn't already been loaded (together
with some locking).
The Intel MTRR patch is similar - add some locking, and add some logic to
just not do it on the right CPU (you're _not_ supposed to read to see if
you are writing the same value: MTRR's can at least in theory have
side-effects, so it's not the same check as for the microcode update).
