The meaning of the bits in CSR13 depends on each other.
The databook lists the suggested values in Hex.
Having symbolic values wouldn't help at all.

No.  It wouldn't help.  It would just make you *think* that you could hack the
code without knowing what is going on.

My view is that the Tulip driver complexity is because it supports 150
different chip and transceiver designs, all around a common core.
Splitting the 
I'm not opposed to having multiple drivers, after all I designed the 8390
set, but it doesn't make sense in this case.  (In fact I oppose the Xircom
driver additions.  The Xircom design is similar, but doesn't share the
common semantics.  It should never have been integrated.)

My Tulip driver does allow forcing the media type.  You just have to know
the transceiver details to do this.

No, it won't.  The problem isn't that easy.

No, that's not the problem.  You might blame it on the constants, but you
didn't understand the task you were taking on when you decided to take over
maintaining the Ethernet drivers.  It took years to write the driver set --
it's something you can just pick up in a few months.  And expecting me to
now fix or maintain your hacked up code branch is just completely
unreasonable.
