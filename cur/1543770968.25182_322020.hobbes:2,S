The even/odd-ness of 'x' in the 2.6.x version number discussion
was ultimately rejected as far as it having any stable/development/test
meaning.
Mostly Linus's 2.6.x tree is for stable work and Andrew's -mm
patchset is for development work.  However, as I often say,
everything is relative.  There are no absolutes in this.
