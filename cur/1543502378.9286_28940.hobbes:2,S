I have done some investigation and it seems that at least on Award BIOS,
the "quick post"/"quick power on selftest" option in BIOS causes the BIOS
to skip memory testing. Possibly this leaves RAM untouched after a hard
reset.
So another possibility is to have a "clean/dirty" flag at the top of RAM,
similar to what is used for mounted filesystems. If the OS cleanly shuts
down, this flag is set "clean", it indicates it was a clean shutdown and
no crashdump is needed. If it is left "dirty", then lilo can do a memory
dump to the swap partition, which is then picked up by 'swapon' and
written to the filesystem.
