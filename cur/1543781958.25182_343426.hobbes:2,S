Same now with 2.6.13-rc6-mm1. This time it got really bad:

uuu, now many of these
Aug 21 02:09:18 gandalf vmunix:     ACPI-0131: *** Error: Invalid owner_id: 00
and many many more of these:
Aug 21 03:07:19 gandalf vmunix:     ACPI-0096: *** Error: Could not allocate new owner_id (32 max), AE_OWNER_ID_LIMIT
Unfortunately I cannot in any way track down this problem to specific
kernels, or specific work situations. It sometimes happens, sometimes
not. 
If anyone has any idea how to debug such a stupid problem, I would be
glad. 
Best wishes
Norbert
