I have 32GB card here...
root@amd:/home/pavel/WWW/wear/tinylight# time cat /dev/mmc1 > /dev/null
cat: /dev/mmc1: Input/output error

...maybe it was because of powerfail? I'll try to run badblocks to
recover it...
...I did. Badblocks did not help, but cat /dev/zero > /dev/mmc1
did.. And yes, thosse 'temporarily bad blocks' seem very much
powerfail related.
Its bad, because ext2/3 does not seem to handle this very well... not
even fsck does the selective rewrite... :-(.
