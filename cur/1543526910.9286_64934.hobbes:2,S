   Exactly the same situation here: same message, same kernel version,
   same Adaptec SCSI driver.
   2.3.47pre3 boots/runs fine, 2.3.47pre6 and anthing newer won't boot.
Have either of you tried 2.3.47 final?  This "kernel BUG" case
should be fixed.
If there are still problems, please send more details.
Thanks.
Later,
