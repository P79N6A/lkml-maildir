Subject: [2.6 patch] mm/hugetlb.c: fix duplicate variable
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

It's confusing that set_max_huge_pages() contained two different 
variables named "ret", and although the code works correctly this should 
be fixed.
The inner of the two variables can simply be removed.
Spotted by sparse.
