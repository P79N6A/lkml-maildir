Definitely.  "several leaders" aka partitioning is also becoming 
increasing paired with efforts at enhancing locality of reference.  Both 
Google and Amazon sort their distributed tables lexographically, which 
[ideally] results in similar data being stored near each other.
A bit of an improvement over partitioning-by-hash, anyway, for some 
workloads.
