That's about right.  The page_mapped checks, at several levels, make
it very hard to hit this case in practice; but it is possible for the
page to be unmapped and the anon_vma unlinked and kmem_cache_freed
while vmscan is racing through page_lock_anon_vma.

(It doesn't affect your argument, but we won't necessarily see list_empty
there: the anon_vma slot may already have got reused for a different
bundle of vmas completely; but its lock remains a lock and its list
remains a list of vmas, and the worst that happens is that
page_referenced_anon or try_to_unmap_anon wanders through an irrelevant
bundle of vmas, looking for a page that cannot be found there.)

I had been meaning to take a fresh look at page_lock_anon_vma, to see
whether recent RCU developments in -mm affected it.  Thanks for saving
me the trouble.
You and Paul know infinitely more about CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU than I do,
so if you believe that the change below is enough, that's great, it's
much simpler than I'd feared might be needed.  CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU
rather scares me, but perhaps it's less worrying than I'd imagined.
Have you checked through the SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU end in slab.c?
Is what that's doing still valid?

It might be wiser to call that one page_unlock_anon_vma ;)
(I'm slightly disgruntled that page_lock_anon_vma takes a struct page *,
but page_unlock_anon_vma no struct page *.  But it would be silly to do
it differently, or mess with the naming: besides, it's a static function
and the prototype guards against error anyway.)

Looks fine to me: please go ahead a make a patch for -mm, Oleg: thanks.
I've CC'ed Christoph for several reasons.
One, I think he was trying to persuade me a year ago to change
page_lock_anon_vma as you're now proposing; but I resisted, preferring
to keep the RCU stuff self-contained within page_lock_anon_vma: let's
credit him for prescience, and admit you've proved me wrong.
Two, in his SLUB thread it sounds like he's toying with mixing up kmem
caches of similar sizes: that seems a really bad idea to me (for reasons
Andi and others have made) and I expect it'll get dropped; but in case
not, let's note that the anon_vma cache is one which would fare very
badly from getting mixed in with others (lock would no longer remain
a lock, list would no longer remain a list, across that race).
Three, he has a recurring interest in this unusual page_lock_anon_vma,
mainly for page migration reasons, so let's keep him informed.
