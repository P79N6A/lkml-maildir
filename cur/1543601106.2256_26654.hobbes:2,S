Hello...
First you have to assign IP-adresses to the ppp*-devices, this can be
done automatically at connect (so its done when you connect via ppp to
an ISP), but yo can also do it by hand.
I would suggest to read "man ifconfig", as i know, it should work like
something:
ifconfig ppp0 <ip> netmask <mask> up
This on both sides of the ppp-link.
Read also "man pppd".
After you have the interfaces (test them by pinging your own ppp0-IP),
you should lay some routing to them, e.g. you can set the default route
to the ppp*-device, so every packet will be send to the other maschine:
route add default gw ppp0
After that you should be able to ping the other maschines ip over the
ppp-link. Then the packetcounter will increase.
Solong..
Frank.

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
