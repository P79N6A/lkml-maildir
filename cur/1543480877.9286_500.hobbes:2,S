Subject: 2.2.0pre8ac1 also fails to boot on Alpha

Someone previously reported that boot stalls on 2.2.0pre8 for a DEC
AlphaStation 200 4/233.  Just to further expand, the same lockup happens
with 2.2.0pre8ac1 with the same symptoms.
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get a bootable system since
2.2.0pre7ac4.  ac5-ac7 caused an Oops in "init" even after recompiling
SysVinit.
