I seem to be getting a rather odd kernel lockup on 2.4.
I am using XFree 3.3.6 ( I believe ).
Whenever I start X, my session starts up like normal,
but soon locks HARD.  Is this a known issue?  I 
suspected the fb stuff, and so I removed it and the 
problem remains.
Any ideas?  I can repeat it every single time.
