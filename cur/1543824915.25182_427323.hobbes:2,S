Don't think so.
With this:

That great stream of assembler errors comes down to:

arch/i386/kernel/entry.S:858: Error: open CFI at the end of file; missing .cfi_endproc directive

So there seems to be a missing startproc in there.

I get
arch/i386/kernel/entry.S: Assembler messages:
arch/i386/kernel/entry.S:860: Error: invalid sections for operation on `L0' and `L0'
Which is a bit mysterious.
Still, I expect that with a bit of fiddling this patch can be made to work
with older binutils.  I also suspect there's actually something wrong with
it.
