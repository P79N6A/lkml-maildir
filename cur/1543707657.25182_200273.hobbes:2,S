yes, I've acknowledged that. I know you aren't going to give me the
ideal solution, I'm just exploring how far this is from the ideal and
trying to get a feel for how much it actually gains us compared to
what we do now. 
If I understand things correctly then I think that your suggestion
probably does gain us a fair bit, but I think that biting my head off
for exploring just how much the gain is versus the current code and
the "ideal" code is a bit much.
Cheers, Tridge
