Well, I doubt the difference will be more than a few bytes, if you compare
the cpio archive sizes after compression with gzip.

But then every person who wants to build a kernel will have to have
the patched version of cpio until such a time it is part of the standard
cpio tool (which may be "never").  I would much rather use the currently
available tools than save 20 bytes off a 900kB kernel image.
