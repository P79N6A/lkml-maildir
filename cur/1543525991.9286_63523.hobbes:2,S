Yeap I plan to if I keep this system for now.
But actually soyo is rated good, espically the model I had, 5ehm, I guess
I just got a bum one or after almost 2 yrs it's just shot.
Getting the FIC VA-503A (newer than 503+), their new motherboard,
probably the best motherboard for super7 you can get in a AT form factor.
ATX is better but if I am going to have to spend $70 for a atx case I
might as well wait and go athlon.
CHIPSET: VIA MVP3 NORTHBRIDGE with VIA MVP4 686A super south which adds
onboard audio and udma66 and probably better udma33 performance since I
think the orgional 586b southbridge has bussmaster ide problems
3 dimm slots
up to 2 meg cache for cache range of 384meg
4 pci slots instead of the usual 3 pci when you have a AT mb with a agp
slot
1 isa slot but I only need one for my old gus pnp clone for dos games
All this for $85 for a 1 meg cache version or $105 for the 2 meg version
since I only have a part time job, I can afford $110 much easier than $400
for a athlon, case, mb and cpu and my k6-2 400 was more than fine for what
I needed for now, till I get a better job.
Thanks for the help
Jason
