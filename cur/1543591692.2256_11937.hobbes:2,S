This does not imply it's necessarily a good idea.
We are comparing
echo "9600" > /proc/self/fd/0/speed (or /dev/ttyS0/speed)
echo "8" > /proc/self/fd/0/bits (or /dev/ttyS0/bits)
with 
echo -e "speed 9600\nbits 8" > /proc/self/fd/0/ioctl (or
/dev/ttyS0/ioctl).
My personal preference goes to the latter, but it's a matter of taste
(and convention choice)
(echo -n "keymap " ; cat keymap) > /dev/tty1/ioctl
(echo -n "font " ; cat font) > /dev/tty1/ioctl
This seems ugly to you?

It does not seems appropriate to permit to change IDE timings using an
handle to a partition... nor it seems very safe under a permissions
point of view.
