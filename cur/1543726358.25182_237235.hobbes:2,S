As long as the "init" routines are run on every startup (not just kexec ones),
they should get plenty of testing (though not from bad card state).
I still think we could share code by running the shutdown routines from 
the *new* kernel  before trying to init the card if they're written in a 
robust way so as to allow it ... is that insane?
