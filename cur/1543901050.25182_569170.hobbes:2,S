I have no objection to changing these to GFP_NOFS or GFP_ATOMIC, because
the number of times this function is called is really quite small (only
for existing inodes when the size of the fixed fields in the inode is
increasing) and the buffers are freed immediately so this won't put any
undue strain on the atomic memory pools.
That said, there is also a GFP_KERNEL allocations in ext3_xattr_block_set()
under xattr_sem, so the same problem would exist there.
I also just noticed that "buffer" and "b_entry_name" are leaked in
ext4_expand_extra_isize() if the while loop is run more than one time
(again a relatively rare event).
Cheers, Andreas
