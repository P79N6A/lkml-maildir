Anyone knows of an open mailing list / newsgroup about VMware? If such a
thing doesn't exist, I'll happily create one and, if not much of an
annoyance, advertise it here -- just once I promise! ;)
I'd like to discuss heavy-metal technical issues about the relationship
between VMware, the Linux kernel, X, Samba and the like.
Thank you for your kind attention.
