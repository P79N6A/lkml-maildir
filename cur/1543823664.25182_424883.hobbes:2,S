It looks bad.  I don't like it. The priority boost is even more peculiar
in this patch.

The assignment of p->sleep_avg = ceiling doesn't make much logical sense.
Because INTERACTIVE_SLEEP is scaled proportionally with nice value, e.g.
the lower the nice value, the lower the interactive_sleep.  However, priority
calculation is inverse of p->sleep_avg, e.g. the smaller the sleep_avg, the
smaller the bonus, thus the higher dynamic priority.
Take one concrete example: for a prolonged sleep, say 1 second, nice(-10)
will have a priority boost of 4 while nice(0) will have a priority boost of
9. The ceiling algorithm looks like is reversed. I would think kernel should
at least enforce same ceiling value independent of nice value.
