I thought about it, but it did not work out all that well. The reason being,
that the memory controller is called in from places besides cgroup.
mem_cgroup_charge_common() for example is called from several places in mm.
Calling into cgroups to check, enabled/disabled did not seem right.
Hence I put the boot option in mm/memcontrol.c

The controller can be bound, but I just don't populate the files associated with
the controller
