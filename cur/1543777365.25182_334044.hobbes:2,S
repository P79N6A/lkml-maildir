Oh dear, it seems that I missed a load of fixups then.  I only
scanned include/asm-* for SERIAL_PORT_DFNS - and I stupidly
thought that PPC this "platform" directory would be in include/asm-ppc.

Well, in this case, the "whinging" resulted in finding a _real_ bug
and locating why your ports weren't being found.  So I guess it's
good for something.
Can you mail me a diff of the changes you made to
arch/ppc/platforms/sandpoint.h please?  If that file is being used
it seems that you actually have 4 ports defined in total.  However,
I'm a little confused because the sandpoint.h defines don't seem to
match your original dmesg output.
