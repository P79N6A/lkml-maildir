Getting rid of 100 lines of code would certainly be worth doing...
Assuming I want the same configuration for the hardware as I did the last time
I used it is OK - provided that assumption is NOT in the kernel. As a default
behaviour in userspace, it's fine.
In the NIC example, I might well want the DHCP client to run whenever I
activate the card. Bringing the NIC up with the old configuration - which, with
dynamic IP addresses, could now include someone else's IP address! - is worse
than useless.

So if I take the NIC with me, Linux automagically misconfigures it for me. No
thanks.
