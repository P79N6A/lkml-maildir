Then perhaps someone (hopefully ORBS) needs to create a similar service
where there are different levels of blocking that the smtp admin chooses
how and what to block based on these levels reported by the service
(perhaps ORBS).
1 - known spam relays
2 - open relays, but not known to send spam
3 - unknown because of blocked checks
When the email comes in, the check goes out to the service, the repsonse
comes back with a level, and the admins configuration decides what that
level warrants (depending on the software support on the admins side, flag
it, blackhole it, mail bomb to retaliate, whatever your pleasure...).
