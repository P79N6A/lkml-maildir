It doesn't help me directly - what i need is the same thing 
for SD_SIBLING_INIT for the CMP changes.
But it seems I need to do some other work to properly support the K8
CMP first, so I'm defering attacking this a bit.

It would be nice if there was a SD_DEFAULT_NODE_INIT and a 
SD_DEFAULT_SIBLING_INIT in some generic
file that architecture code can use as a base for tweaking.
For the CMP change I currently only want to remove SD_SHAREPOWER
from SIBLING_INIT to get rid of SMT nice.
Later we'll probably want a SD_DEFAULT_CMP_INIT too that gives
generic values for a dual core. Dual cores should be soon pretty
common and tuning for them will be needed on several architectures
(ppc64, ia64, x86, x86-64, sparc, parisc? ...). But figuring out good
values for this will require a lot of benchmarking first.
