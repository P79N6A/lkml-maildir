Basically the PCI core should implement what PM is necessary, because
eventually struct pci_driver will become a more generic struct driver. 
When that happens, drivers using pci_driver::{suspend,resume} will
automagically work under the new system.  To answer your question, the
PCI[/driver] core should support messages other than PM_{SUSPEND,RESUME}
if they need to be supported.  Right now I mostly see suspend/resume
implemented and nothing else, so that is a very straightforward
conversion to the new PCI API.
Why does maestro.c not use my suggestion?  Because it doesn't use struct
pci_driver.
Why does trident.c not use my suggestion?  Only because noone has
written and tested the patch for it yet :)  It uses struct pci_driver
and should be updated to use ::suspend/resume.

That's because full PM support is still very much a work in progress :) 
The linux-pm-devel sourceforge list has carried recent discussions, as
has linux-kernel.  Patrick Mochel(sp?) @ Transmeta has posted a
hackers-only patch which incorporates my PCI PM work as well as his own
ACPI work to do suspend and resume.
