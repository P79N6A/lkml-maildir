Well, I'd like to have a hardware with CAS-n operation for one
thing. But what would this buy us? Having different kernel algorithms
for x86 and mythical cas-n-able hardware is not viable.

As this self-contradictory (unless equivalence is not reflective in your
world) description is not the way I treat "these lists", I'll --instead
of pointing out to errors in your proposal-- follow (with improvements)
your advice, and re-interpret it the way I want:

Indeed. But maybe this is at least partially because "this guy" fails to
abide to the elementary rules of grammar?
One who really wants to communicate with other people, follows common
conventions that exist specifically on purpose of making communication
possible. If you want to engage into a discussion with other people, you
should put aside considerations of your own convenience or habit, and
stick to the common protocol. It's that simple.

Pray, do tell me you typed this without a shift key. I'd very much do
like to not destroy the very essence of 20 years of accumulated
experience.

Please do this with my address in exchange: suddenly, I am
overwhelmed with a glimmering presentiment of sharing this location with
a lot of worthy people.
