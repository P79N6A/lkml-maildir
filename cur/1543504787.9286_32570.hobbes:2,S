I'm not too bothered who's "responsible" for it - as long as it's actually 
possible to do it. I'm happy to handle it in user-space as much as possible, 
but we need a small amount of modification to the kernel drivers to make that
possible - that is; a way of passing the required mixer levels to the driver 
when it starts up (or postponing the mixer init until it's given the levels by 
an ioctl), and a way of obtaining the final settings from the driver before 
it's unloaded.

I meant this to be automated - the levels recorded from the previous 
incarnation of the driver should be passed to the new incarnation without the 
user ever seeing them.
