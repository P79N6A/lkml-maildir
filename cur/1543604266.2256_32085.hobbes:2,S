What I wanted to know was, who is calling/holding the BKL? Is it because
lock_kernel is called in sys_create_module() and sys_init_module().
I also looked at sd.c, it does not hold the BKL before calling register_blkdev()
it calls devfs_register_blkdev() from sd_init().
Maybe I am still missing something.
