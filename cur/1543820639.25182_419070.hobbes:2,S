Vin,
Please don't top post, many will yell at you on this list for that.
OS is on sda, nothing is on sdb which is probably why I don't have the
behavior happening at unexpected times, sdb won't be used except for
during my test.
I believe I am seeing similar behavior on sata_mv controllers so
it might be a more basic problem in libata, and not related to the specific
sata_nv driver at all.
