 That's an APIC bug.  When Intel originally released the APIC (some 
thirteen years ago) they stated it should be used as a source of the timer 
interrupt instead of the 8254.  There is no excuse for changing the 
behaviour after so many years.  So if you are on a broken system, you may 
want to work around the bug, but it shouldn't impact good systems.
