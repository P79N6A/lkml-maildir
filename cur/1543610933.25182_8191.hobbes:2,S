Hi,
I've encountered an odd difference in TCP performance between the 2.4.15 and
2.2.20 kernels. Perhaps someone can explain this phenomenon...
(I'm not a kernel hacker.)
Background:
I administer my Linux box over a LAN via SSH2 from a Windows 2000 machine.
OpenSSH 3.0.1 is used on the Linux side and PuTTY on the Windows side.
The issue:
I have my keyboard repeat rate set high (31 chars/sec). When I'm SSH'ed into
Linux and I hold down a letter key (for example), it does not repeat
"smoothly" with a 2.4 kernel installed. The characters seem to show up about
2 at a time. It's as if I'm going over a high-latency connection; I'm not.
If I revert to 2.2.20, this effect does not occur. It also does not occur
when I SSH into OpenBSD 2.9.
So apparently the effect is caused by some change in the 2.4 kernel. But I'm
very curious to know what it is, and if there is maybe some way to go back
to the "old" behavior. (It drives me nuts!)
tcpdump seems to shed some light. Here are some tcpdump log excerpts of keys
being repeated and echoed back...
Linux 2.4.15
- Notice that there is a 40 millisecond delay every 5 packets. This won't do
because the keys repeat faster than that!

Linux 2.2.20
- The 40 millisecond delay isn't there. The packets seem to be sent/received
at the right time.
