This is usually called "abstraction" and allows you to change
the data structures (when needed) without breaking all the code.
You can learn from this.  If swsusp used abstractions it wouldn't
need to have to stick its nose into the code and data structures
from other subsystems and it might even stop breaking every other
release.
cheers,
Rik
