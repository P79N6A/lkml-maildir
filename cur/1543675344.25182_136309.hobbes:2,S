   I believe the remaining limits are harmless, but of course it's cleaner
   to not have them.
The ethtool one was the worst.  It's why I didn't copy your code :-)
   If you use the function that extensively it would be better to allow
   it to nest (e.g. add a field for the current offset in  task struct). 
   Otherwise someone will get it wrong sooner or later.
   (like the sock/tw_bucket ;) 
This is why I kept it private to the compat layer, I see no reason
to let it slip into other code at all.
   Ok thanks. I will port it to my 2.4 code.
   Did you test them all?
I tested most of them, but very lightly.  I didn't test the
SG_IO stuff but that barely worked even beforehand :-)
