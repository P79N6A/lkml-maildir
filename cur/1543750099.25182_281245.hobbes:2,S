The only problem I've had was the one I posted about earlier, 
something locked up amandad and this server didn't get backed up till 
I rebooted & reran amdump about 4ish this morning.  That was after 
about 29 hrs uptime.  It also claimed that a samba share I had 
mounted was busy(but that machine had been powered down for the 
night), and kpm was complaining about a lack of a dcopserver so it 
couldn't connect to the system to monitor anything.  htop worked as 
expected though.  Now I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.  If it 
does, I'll go back to Ingo's last realtime-preempt patch.  That was 
solid, & had an 8 day uptime when I rebooted to 2.6.10.
