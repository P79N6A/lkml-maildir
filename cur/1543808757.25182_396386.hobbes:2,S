The ->mapping check is there essentially to hit user mapped pages that
would be modified by the kernel using kernel space memory accesses
other than those done by copy_user_page() and clear_user_page() (and
their brothers copy_user_highpage() and clear_user_highpage() which
just call the former directly on a non-HIGHPAGE platform like
sparc64).
Hugepages actually have no D-cache aliasing issues by definition on
sparc64 because the smallest possible hugepage size is 64K which is
larger than the D-cache aliasing factor (which is 16K).
