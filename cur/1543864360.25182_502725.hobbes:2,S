Well, there's no way a userspace program could depend on all hidden SSID
APs having the <hidden> tag, since if you stick in another,
non-ieee80211-stack card it won't be like that.  So I don't think we
should care about <hidden> in d80211, but I don't think we can remove it
from ieee80211 either.  The only case where we'll care about it is if we
move to common scan-result processing code, and there we may have to put
a compat flag in that the driver can set or something.  But we should
definitely _not_ use <hidden> in d80211 or cfg80211, because any program
depending on <hidden> just won't work with anything other than an ipw
card.
