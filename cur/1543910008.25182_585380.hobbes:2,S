Even, the only way to implement a "non-volatile" atomic_read() is
essentially as a plain int (you can do some tricks so you cannot
assign to the result and stuff like that, but that's not the issue
here).
So if that would be the behaviour we wanted, just get rid of that
whole atomic_read() thing, so no one can misuse it anymore.
