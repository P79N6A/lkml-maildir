hi,
I'm trying to make this card work under 2.4.4, but I couldn't find a patch
anywhere to get it working under 2.4.x nor on 2.2.x. I tried with the I2O
kernel support, but it didn't work, it only reported errors after a pretty
long waiting :)
The CDROM the card comes with brings a precompiled module (dpt_i2o) which
works fine (only?) with 2.2.14.
Adaptec web site says next to nothing about current linux drivers for this
card. I don't understand why they don't just provide a patch against
current 2.2.x and 2.4.x ...
The best I've found is 
http://people.redhat.com/tcallawa/dpt/,
 where
they provide a rpm packaged 2.2.19 kernel already with support for adaptec
2100S, and works :-) ... (where did they get the driver??? mistery...)
So, is it possible to make it work under 2.4.4? :-)
ps: has anyone the patch againt 2.2.x? (it would be nice to have the
patch, although I already have 2.2.19 with support)
Thanks.
