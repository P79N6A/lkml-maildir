other notes :
patch does not work
it's creating file in /tmp ( /tmp/cvs..... ) but the files should be named
differently en placed in <linux-source-dir>/include/video or in
<linux-source-dir>/drivers/video
it gives me 3 pages of warnings about:
assingment makes integers from pointer without a cast
large integer impplicitly truncated to unsigned type
assingment discards const from pointer target type
many more
vga.h in include/video should have 2 extra lines:
#include <asm/io.h>
#include <asm/vga.h>
otherwise te kernel could not compile
the file include/video/Config.in has no config line for i386
i hope this helps in making this this working
i'm self still a student and have to litte programming experience to hack
the stuff to getter. but i'm trying
PS : if you need more info or have new patches to test mail me
grtz.
