Don Becker has some text at:

which includes a section:

So I grepped drivers/*/*.c  in the nearest handy kernel source, which happened to be
2.2.16, and found 113 uses of SA_INTEERUPT, 64 in drivers/scsi/*.c and the rest spread
around.
Do we have a problem? Should it be fixed as part of the cleanup before 2.4.0?
