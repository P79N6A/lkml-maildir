I asked the people that know more about this architecture than me and
they confirmed that this is a requirement. I will double check
tomorrow with the people that did the initial Linux support.
I haven't checked the original patch but it might work (by luck)
without the I-cache invalidation (and without stressing it too
much). This is because you might do a full mm flush when a process
exits and the I-cache would be clean for newly allocated pages (only
the D-cache needs flushing). If you don't overload memory, you don't
get pages swapped-out/removed and the code in a page for a given
process might remain unchanged until the process exits.
