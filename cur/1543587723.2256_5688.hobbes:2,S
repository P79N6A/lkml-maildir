Hint: "I'm trying to imagine a case when writing all zeroes to /etc/passwd
is anything but a major failure, but I can't. So why don't we make
/etc/passwd world-writable?"
Right. Security.
There is _never_ any excuse for panic'ing because of some inherent
limitation of the data structures. You can return -ENOMEM, -EAGAIN or
somehting like that, but you must _not_ allow a panic (or a roll-over,
which would just result in corrupted kernel data structures).
Note that the limit is probably really easy to work around even without
extending the number of bits: a sleeper that notices that the count is
even _halfway_ to rolling around could easily do something like:
 - undo "this process" action
 - sleep for 1 second
 - try again from the beginning.
I certainly agree that no _reasonable_ pattern can cause the failure, but
we need to worry about people who are malicious. The above trivial
approach would take care of that, while not penalizing any non-malicious
users.
So I'm not worried about this at all. I just want people _always_ to think
about "how could I mis-use this if I was _truly_ evil", and making sure it
doesn't cause problems for others on the system.
(NOTE: This does not mean that the kernel has to do anything _reasonable_
under all circumstances. There are cases where Linux has decided that
"this is not something a reasonable program can do, and if you try to do
it, we'll give you random results back - but they will not be _security_
holes". We don't need to be _nice_ to unreasonable requests. We just must
never panic, otherwise crash or allow unreasonable requests to mess up
_other_ people)
