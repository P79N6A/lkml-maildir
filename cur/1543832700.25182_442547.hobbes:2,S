BTW, it's fortunate that you are maintaing it. The I2C code in cirrusfb
uses vga_wseq() and vga_rseq(). Is it safe WRT races between I2C
adapter code and fb code? I don't see any locking here, and both
functions are non-atomic (write merging and posting will not break it,
but it looks like I need a lock for concurent access).
