   Ug!!!! This is insane. Okay there is a few reason for why I called it 
graphics. The number one thing to straighten out is video vs graphics.
There is a big difference between the two. Video cards are meant to 
decode or/and encode program or transport streams. Usually that is 
mpeg streams. This is what I do for a living. Graphics cards are meant 
to display raster or vector graphics objects. It just today alot of
hardware are both so the terms have become mixed up. On the hardware 
boards we have at work the video and graphics chip are physically 
seperate chips. 
   Now for the issue of display, framebuffer, or graphics. A framebuffer
is a chunk of memory that is used to create what is displayed. Now that
the fbdev layer has moved to a accelerated framework it is possible to use
non framebuffer devices for fbcon. So it doesn't make sense to call it 
that. The name graphics covers the idea best. Especially since fbcon is
meant for "graphical" consoles. As for display. That is just apart of 
that. I plan to create a display directory in /sys/graphics so we can 
get monitor data. 
   So lets leave the patch with name graphics alone.
