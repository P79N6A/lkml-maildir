Depending on what parameters you have passed to fsx, it isn't necessarily
going to be doing a lot of I/O.  The default for the fsx I have is to max
the file size out at 256kB (on average it will be about half of that), and
you have 1070 instances running, so that agrees with the ~110MB of cache
difference between O_DIRECT and non-O_DIRECT.
Also, in the non-O_DIRECT case fsx will be doing reads from cache and not
disk, so there is no reason to see anything in "bi".  The writes may or
may not be a problem, as fsx is "truncate happy", so some large amounts of
data that are "written" are immediately truncated again.  For O_DIRECT,
everything is going straight to/from disk, hence much higher IO numbers.
What you should really be checking is how many "ops per second" you are
getting from fsx with and without O_DIRECT.  It would be my guess that
the O_DIRECT fsx is actually _slower_ because it is doing more I/O (and
waiting for it to complete).  Run each fsx with some fixed number of ops
(-N <num ops>) and see how long it takes for both tests to complete.
