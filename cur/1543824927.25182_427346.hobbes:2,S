 This seems to have gone as quick as it appeared. I'm currently running
rc5 with three hours of uptime, which is much longer than I ever managed
with the broken kernel.
 It looks like it was due to some miscompilation issue, though it
happened with a clean tree (make mrproper) so it seemed to be a problem
with the kernel.
