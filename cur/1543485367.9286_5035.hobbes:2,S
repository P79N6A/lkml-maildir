Hello again!
Sorry for nerving again ;) but I have another problem: I would like to 
specify the address of a function as parameter of a syscall.
My syscall should have this prototype:
asmlinkage int funcname (int a, void (*func)(int b, int* c));
The problem is now, that I have to register this syscall in 
include/asm/unistd.h via the command
static inline _syscall2(int, funcname, int, a, void*, ...)
And these ... are my problem. If I insert func(sth), I got the error that 
sth isn't correct, if I insert func() I got warnings that the and the 
compilation crashes when the system tries to compile 
arch/i386/kernel/init_task.c. The same is when I insert func, only without 
the warnings :(
Any ideas?
 marc
