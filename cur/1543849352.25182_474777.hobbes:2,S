A comment of why we are checking for nr_running would be nice.
And one more thing. We can reduce some of the tasklet invoking complexity
by actually checking for a load_balance() need at any domain and thus
invoking tasklet which will do the load balance, rather than unconditionally
invoking tasklet for each tick.
