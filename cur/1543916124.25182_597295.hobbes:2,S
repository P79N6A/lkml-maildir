Did I miss the section where the modified semantics about which
mounted file systems can use the cache and which ones can not
was implemented?  For example, mounts of the same file system
from the server with "fsc", but with different mount options
such as "rw" or "ro" or NFS dependent mount options, must fail
because of the way that the cache is accessed.  Also, perhaps
a little confusing, that mounts of different paths on a server
which land on the same mounted file system on the server, but
with these differing mount options must also fail?
    Thanx...
