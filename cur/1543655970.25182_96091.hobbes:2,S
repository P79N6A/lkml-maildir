It works up to less than 30 bits - a 0.9 TB Device shows up as
SCSI device sdb: 1806745600 512-byte hdwr sectors (-174457 MB)
while a 480 GB Device (correctly) shows up this way:
SCSI device sda: 961818624 512-byte hdwr sectors (492451 MB)
At 0.5 TB (29 bits) the first problem occurs: negative size.
At 1 T (30 bits), the sector count also becomes negative.
Your patch (thank you!) does fix both problems and up to 1.9 TB,
everything works as expected:
SCSI device sdb: 3974840320 512-byte hdwr sectors (2035118 MB)
Yes, it's purely cosmetical, but should be included in the main tree.
Regards,
Anders
