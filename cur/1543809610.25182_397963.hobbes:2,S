Actually I think it is.  The admin should control what is running
on their box.

Actually I think this is the model we need to investigate if we
need to extend the interface to handle new things.
By using the filesystem it allows things to be cobbled together with
scripts so new C programs are not required.  
It happens that Plan9 does it this way successfully, so there is some
precedent.
Actually increasingly I like this notion, as it also allows us to
export the ability to kill a process with a network filesystem.
Which means multiple machine management in a cluster could easily
reduce to the same set of tools as multiple pid space management.

The point seems to be that the identifiers don't matter just
so long as there is one.
