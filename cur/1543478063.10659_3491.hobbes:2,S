Hi guys,
I am looking to establish a list to discuss development of the kernel
build process: Configure, Menuconfig, xconfig, Makefiles, 'make dep',
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS, building modules, all that layer of kernel-related
software.
I found "linux-config" on vger, but it seems to be about sound card
settings and user-land program configuraiton.  What I'm looking for
would be more like "linux-kbuild".
If there is already such a list, can you point me to it?
If there is not such a list, is there anyone here who would volunteer
to host it?
