By definition of "needless", none. But the question is precisely
whether the parentheses are always needless. The way your formulate
your question suggests that you aren't actually interested in
discussing the matter, so I am wondering why are you taking part at all.

No, I didn't. I said that parentheses were sometimes useful. You said
that parentheses were usually needless (which isn't that different,
BTW.) Combining both statements into "useless parentheses provide
value" is a logical flaw. And attributing it to me is dishonest.

My "positive motivation" was that this statement, as is, is more
confusing than helpful. As a matter of fact, it led us to disagree on a
patch you sent. And I would like contributors to focus on the more
important parts of CodingStyle. If someone wants to improve the
statement instead of removing it, that's fine with me, but not having
the time to work on this, I proposed the removal.

It does already:
