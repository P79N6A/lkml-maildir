Yes, I recommend pulling this tree now.
While there is a fair amount of text changed, the functional changes
here are actually quite small, and have been in -mm for a long time --
some of them already shipping in distros before being upstream.
Yes, there is a fair amount of fluffy cleanup here -- seems there is
never a good time in the release cycle to do them, but as andrew says,
we're in this for the long term, so we do have to do them some time.
I don't see any big risks in them so it seems appropriate to push after rc1.
Note that there is a much larger body of ACPI changes in flight
that I have excluded from this pull request and are waiting for 2.6.21.
thanks,
