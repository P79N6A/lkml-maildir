That's a fundamental problem of DECLARE_COMPLETION() done on the kernel 
stack - it does build-time initialization with no opportunity to inject 
any runtime logic. (which lockdep would need. Maybe i missed some clever 
way to add a runtime callback into the initialization? [*])
Btw., there is no danger from missing the initialization of a wait 
structure: lockdep will detect "uninitialized" on-stack locks and will 
complain about it and turn itself off. [this happened a few times during 
development - that's how those init_completion() calls got added]
But at a minimum these initializations need to become lockdep-specific 
key-reinits - otherwise there will be impact to non-lockdep kernels too.

[*] the only solution i can see is to introduce 
DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK(), which could call a function with &wait 
passed in, where that function would return with a structure. The macro 
magic would resolve to something like:
  struct completion wait = lockdep_init_completion(&wait);
and thus the structure would be initialized. But this method cannot be 
used for static scope uses of DECLARE_COMPLETION, because it's not a 
constant initializer. So we'd definitely have to make a distinction in 
terms of _ONSTACK(). Is there really no compiler feature that could help 
us out here?
