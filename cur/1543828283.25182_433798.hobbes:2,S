I like to read the shortlog for getting an overview of the changes 
containing a bit more detail than your verbal summary at the top.
I need git for getting more detail and I could generate them myself. But 
if it wasn't there, I might not generate it myself, and might therefore 
not ask "Why did this patch get into -rc6?" or become curious enough for 
using git to check the contents of a commit.
