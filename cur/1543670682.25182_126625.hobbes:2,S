	Thanks for the heads up. I'm preparing a massive skb leak
patch for 2.5.X, I'll slip that into it. I'll probably code that
differently so that it looks "cleaner".
	By the way, this is not terribly important, as if ASSERT do
trigger we usually have bigger problems than memory leaks (like you
may want to reboot rather sooner than later).

	Rather than fixing imaginary non-existing bugs, I prefer to
spend my time fixing real bugs that byte real users. This construct is
perfectly sound and valid, and it needs to be done in this way, the
only issue is that someone should rename "ASSERT" into "IRDA_ASSERT".
	Have fun...
	Jean
