There are no significant differences in that driver between .62 and .63.  So
I am assuming that 2.5.62 works, 2.5.63 doesn't, and that you have not
actually tried 2.5.62's aic7xxx_old in a 2.5.63 tree?
If so, don't bother - it won't make any difference.  Looks like someone broke
something in scsi core which colaterally damaged aic7xxx_old.  I suggest you
feed it into bugme for now.
