I don't know what you are exactly talking about, but there is another
problem except speed:
Most modern harddisks remap bad sectors, so sometimes you can't read a
sector, but if you write the sector is remapped.
I.e. if you "create a new file, write 400 bytes, close the file, sync",
then the data sector should not be read.
Our current Windows 95 & Windows NT file system drivers read the data
sector, and that has caused problems (older ZIP disks, SyQuest,
my own damnaged harddisk?-I don't remember the details).
