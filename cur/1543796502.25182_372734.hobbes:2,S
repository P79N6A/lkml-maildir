sure.. but they don't add new hw support really, and I'd not be
surprised if they rebase to a newer upstream kernel after a while. I
know we did that for RHL, eg RHL 7.(Y-1) got the kernel of RHL7.Y after
RHL7.Y was released, not only to keep the maintenance down, but more so
to get all the bugfixes and hardware support out to customers.
