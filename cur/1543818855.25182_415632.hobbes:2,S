Ok, I can refactor your driver to even remove this and reduce it to exaxtly 
two ifdef sections for your driver. Acceptable?

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  62079     973       4   63056    f650 no-vlan/drivers/net/typhoon.o
  62654     973       4   63631    f88f vlan/drivers/net/typhoon.o
with allyesconfig (minus CONFIG_INFO) and my patches applied.
So maybe the uninlining is enough. Gain after this is just 575 bytes here.
