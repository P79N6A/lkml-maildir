There are some difficulties connected with these suggestions.  They're
maybe not impossible, but it would be tricky.
For one thing, how does one go about telling at the USB level whether one
of the devices contains a mounted filesystem?  Or any open file references
at all, for that matter?  No doubt there's a way to do it, but I don't
know what it is.
For another, hardware behavior is very idiosyncratic.  It's sometimes 
possible to tell that a particular system doesn't supply suspend power to 
a USB controller (because, for instance, the controller doesn't support 
PCI PM or doesn't support D3hot), but this is far from reliable -- I've 
seen mistakes both ways.  It's not as simple as "power available during 
STR, not available during STD".
