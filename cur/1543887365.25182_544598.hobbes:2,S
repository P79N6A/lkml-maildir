I need freezeable wq exactly for the fact that they are synchronized with suspend/resume. My
workitem may do device_register/unregister and it can (and will be) scheduled from irq handler
during resume. As far as I understand, before freezeable wqs, kthreads were the only way to
achieve this behavior, which is less convenient.
