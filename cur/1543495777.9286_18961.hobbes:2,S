Security bug: mkdir removes the sticky bit
There is a security bug in mkdir:
> mkdir -m 1777 /tmp/foo
> ls -l /tmp
drwxrwxrwx   2 root     root         1024 May 14 19:44 foo
The sticky bit is missing.
> strace mkdir -m 1777 /tmp/foo |& grep mkdir
mkdir("/tmp/foo", 01777)                = 0
So it looks to be really kernel related.
[I had fixed it in 2.0 ...]
Another (minor) problem with the frame buffer dev:
1)
> setfont -m <map> <font>
changes the font for all ttys but the map is changed for the current tty only.
[Kernel related ?]
2)
fbset changes the current tty only. How can I change all ttys ?
[Kernel related ?]
