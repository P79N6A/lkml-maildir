Well, snprintf() should be safe, though. It will warn if the caller is 
lazy, but these days, the thing does
	max(buf_size - len, 0)
which should mean that the input layer passes in 0 instead of a negative 
number. And snprintf() will then _not_ print anything. 
So I think input_add_uevent_bm_var() is safe, even if it's not pretty.
However, input_devices_read() doesn't do any sanity checking at all, and 
if that ever ends up printing more than a page, that would be bad. I 
didn't look very closely, but it looks worrisome.
Dmitry?
