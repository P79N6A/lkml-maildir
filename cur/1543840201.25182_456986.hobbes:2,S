This is IRC and the #kernelnewbies channel is where a number of us (folks
following Rik van Riel) lurk. Any client like BitchX should work if you
have those ports open from where you're coming from.

Ok, yeah, I've been trying to get a clean stack trace output and not
really focused on the core issue. The debug output stuff seemed to need
some attention because of the hanging and continuous output of stack
traces. It makes it difficult to figure out what's going on when there
are a cascade of failures going on.
I'll upload those small changes next and try to figure out what's going
on with kjournald and the rtmutex. This is going to be a pain.
