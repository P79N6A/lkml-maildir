Sounds like the driver is buggy.

As I explained for your last patch this change is wrong. Remapping
an already mapped sg is not possible - it leaks IOMMU space and 
cause eventually system failure when the aperture fills up.
You have to somehow handle this in the caller, the pci-dma
layer cannot do it. Eeither free the modified sg and retry with the original 
one or better just don't remap it and use the already mapped one) 
I will add an BUG for passing sgs with dma_address != NULL to 
pci_map_sg(). This should catch such abuses early.

That's the same high level bug I think.
