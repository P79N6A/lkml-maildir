Right.

AFAIKS, this just cures the case where the wild pointer points to the first
block of the offending file. You should perhaps count the blocks you go
through, so a file something like:
 -------+-----+
        ^     |
        |     |
        +-----+
or other strange pointer messups don't get you.
BTW, is fsck (the Linux or the Win32 variety) able to fix this?
