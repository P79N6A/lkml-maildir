Hello,
I have a Compaq Armada 7400 running Mandrake 7.0 with the kernel 2.4.0-test7
and the pcmcia-3.1.19. I have two PCMCIA sockets in my system and only one
seems to work. I can read the following information in the
/var/log/messages:
	pcmcia: Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.11
	kernel:  options: [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
	kernel:  modules
	kernel: Yenta IRQ list 0698, PCI irq11
	kernel: Socket status: 30000020
	kernel: Yenta IRQ list 0698, PCI irq11
	kernel: Socket status: 30000006
	kernel: cs: cb_alloc(bus 2): vendor 0x10b7, device 0x5257
	kernel: PCI: Enabling device 02:00.0 (0000 -> 0003)
	kernel: PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 02:00.0
	pcmcia:  cardmgr.
	cardmgr[386]: starting, version is 3.1.11
	cardmgr[386]: watching 1 sockets
Does it mean only socket 0 is activated ? If yes, why the socket 1 is not
activated ? I have a 3CCFE575CT in the socket 0 and nothing in the socket 1.
If I insert another card in the socket 1, nothing is detected, nothing
happens... I have also two occurences of the [CardBus Watcher] kernel
thread. Is this OK ? The cardctl reports me status and ident only for socket
0.
If somebody can help me, please, let me now.
Thanks a lot,
Claude.
