2.4.18-rc1 unexports page_cache_release and replaces it with a macro, so you
may have one driver under the fs directory that now needs to include 
linux/pagemap.h.
You'll catch the culprit with simething like :
# find fs -name '*.o' | xargs nm -oa|grep page_cache_release
But I sincerely think that you have a damaged 2.4.17 source tree. You may want
to de-tar it again to check. I tried to compile everything under 2.4.18-rc1,
and all compiled well. You may have tried rmap or other patches on it before.
Well, finally I compiled 2.4.18-rc4 with your .config (gcc-2.95.3) while typing
this mail and it compiled and linked :
# tools/build -b bbootsect bsetup compressed/bvmlinux.out CURRENT > bzImage

# Boot sector 512 bytes.
# Setup is 2516 bytes.
