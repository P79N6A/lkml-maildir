Hey Brian,
the mem stick + 2 usb ports my Z505LS work fine with 2.4.16+
(both usb ports have been tested, but the mem stick not [however, it shows
up fine at boot time]).
You might also want to run 2.4.teen because of the new support for the
Sony programmable controller (althought that seems to have gone into 2.4.5)
(under char devices, i believe).

I think I told you about the GVaioControl app that I use for brightness at the
big installfest over the summer, but this seems to actually enable the function
keys.
