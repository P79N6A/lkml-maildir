Just pass the uncoverted strings then. Please note that this is exactly
what happens today - every application running in UTF-8 locale and
facing incompatible filenames has to deal with this problem. I wonder
why so many people pretend that the current situation is "less or more
okay".

You always loose a bit performance when dealing with Unicode. Just
accept it.
