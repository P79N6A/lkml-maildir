This is an intrinsically terrible idea
      1. It creates drivers that are x86+IOAPIC specific
      2. It creates bizzare kernel bugs that will be impossible to track
      3. It creates a disgusting overhead in figuring out what nmi corresponds to what 
         irq.
      4. It will make drivers fail with RTLinux . Of course they will be idiotic
       drivers, but ...
