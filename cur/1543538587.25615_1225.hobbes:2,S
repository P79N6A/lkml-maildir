i think it's a bad approach to add some warning kludge to modprobe.
keep these tools lean and mean - besides, we wouldn't stand a chance
fiddling with modutils on lkml :)
it's no big deal telling the users to have all modules loaded on
startup and no autoclean.
low-latency users will be willing to take this small effort, and
audio boxen tend to have lots of memory, so dynamic unloading will
not be necessary.
just my....
