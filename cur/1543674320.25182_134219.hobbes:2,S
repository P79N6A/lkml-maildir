It sounds reasonable.  A matter of putting together the appropriate
library functions and refactoring a few things.

That's similar to mm/fremap.c:install_page().  (Which forgets to call
update_mmu_cache().  Debatably a buglet.)
However there is not a lot of commonality between the various nopage()s and
there may not be a lot to be gained from all this.  There is subtle code in
there and it is performance-critical.  I'd be inclined to try to minimise
overall code churn in this work.
