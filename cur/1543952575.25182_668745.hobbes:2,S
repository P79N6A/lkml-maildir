Not sure if I can follow you here, but for the smp case cpu_set() is
nothing but a set_bit() which implies both: a memory barrier and a compiler
barrier on s390. The compare and swap instruction used here ensures that
all previous memory accesses will be seen by other cpus.
Btw. the code sequence above will go away soon anyway, since I'm converting
our code to the generic NO_HZ infrastructure.

That should never happen because of the compiler and memory barrier semantics
of cpu_set(). Or... I'm completely misunderstanding you, which wouldn't me
surprise me too much :)
