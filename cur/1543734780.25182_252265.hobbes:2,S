I've found a situation where the vanilla kernel has a behaviour that
makes no sense:

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109238126314192&w=2
A patch by Con Kolivas fixed it:

I cannot offer more details, i have no time for experiments, i just need
a system that works. The vanilla kernel does not.
