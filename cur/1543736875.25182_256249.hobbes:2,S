the patch posted recently on this list reduced it to 1Mb.

MAP_FIXED happily will go over an malloc(), it's both just vma's

your claim was that existing apps would break.
I know you can write a testcase, one can write a testcase even for your
proposed patch showing breakage.

the application, the C library, the dynamic linker, all shared libs it links
against.

You are wrong; the default is 8Mb stack limit in the kernel; I absolutely do
not see where you claim from "most people run with unlimited stack" comes
from.

I am aware of 2 applications breaking. Both did
int ptr;
ptr=malloc(bigchunk);
if (ptr < 0)
	assume_alloc_failure();
Both are open source and since long fixed. Still it made sense to add a
safety net (akpm asked for it; for example in rhel3 or FC2 we do not have one at
all, nor do those kernels have mmaped_base hack). [unhandled content-type:application/pgp-signature]
