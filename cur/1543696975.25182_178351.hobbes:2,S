Sorry, as far as I can tell it's just the wrong direction. Devices mounted
by USB look like... SCSI. And ZIP drives and tapes mounted on parallel
(ppa) look like... SCSI. If Linux had one fully functional ide-scsi driver
it would then present a consistant all-SCSI interface to the applications.
No more ide-floppy, ide-cd, ide-tape, just one driver. And that would
allow use of applications from BSD, Sun, and SysV.
Clearly the ide-scsi driver currently available isn't fully capable, and
as long as Linus doesn't agree that having a single application interface
is elegant and desirable, I can't see anyone doing the things needed.
