Subject: Userspace Test Framework for module loader porting

The userspace test framework I used to develop module loading on
different archs is up at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules/module-test-framework.tar.gz
 
I found it much easier to use for each arch than doing the
crash/reboot cycle (and you can use a real debugger).
BTW, the change to use shared objects for modules is going to be a 2.7
thing: after 10 architectures, MIPS toolchain issues made it
non-trivial.  So the current stuff is what is going to be there for
2.6, so no point waiting 8)
Please report any problems!
Rusty.
