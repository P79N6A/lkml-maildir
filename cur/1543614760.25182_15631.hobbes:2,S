Here's a slice of vmstat 1 on my 2-way x86, 2GB main memory machine
running Postgres 7.2beta4 on Linux 2.4.17:

Check out those figures for context switches!  30,000 switches per second
with only three runnable processes and practically no block I/O seems
quite high to me.  You can also see that the system is spending half its
time in the kernel, presumably in the scheduler.  Postgres is barely
getting any CPU time at all, and the performance suffers noticeably.
Is this a scheduler worst-case, something to be expected, or something I
can work around?
Please CC me since vger's majordomo is an impossible chunk of shit.
