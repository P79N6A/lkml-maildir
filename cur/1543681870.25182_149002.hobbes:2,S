I get these when trying to compile rivafb:
  CC      drivers/video/riva/fbdev.o
drivers/video/riva/fbdev.c: In function `rivafb_cursor':
drivers/video/riva/fbdev.c:1525: warning: passing arg 2 of
`move_buf_aligned' from incompatible pointer type
drivers/video/riva/fbdev.c:1525: warning: passing arg 4 of
`move_buf_aligned' makes pointer from integer without a cast
drivers/video/riva/fbdev.c:1525: too few arguments to function
`move_buf_aligned'
drivers/video/riva/fbdev.c:1527: warning: passing arg 2 of
`move_buf_aligned' from incompatible pointer type
drivers/video/riva/fbdev.c:1527: warning: passing arg 4 of
`move_buf_aligned' makes pointer from integer without a cast

`move_buf_aligned'
I have seen various posts on this driver (with slightly different
errors) but no followups.
