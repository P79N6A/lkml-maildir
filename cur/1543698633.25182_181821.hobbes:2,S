No, the only way to add a hole to a file is ftruncate(), lseek(),
write() (at least, that's the case at the UNIX API level).

It's filesystem-dependent; some filesystems don't implement sparse
files.  The lower bound is one block; on extents-based filesystems like
XFS it might be bigger.  (If you've got 1GB of data, then a 1MB block of
zeros, then another GB of data, you're probably better off allocating a
single 2GB extent rather than two smaller extents with a hole.)
There's no inherent downside to holey files; in fact they can be a
straight-up performance win -- that's a block that doesn't need to be
read from disk, just hand the user a COW pointer to your zero page.  And
if you're lucky and the preceding and following blocks are allocated
adjacent on disk, you can do it all as a single streaming IO.
That said, having holes might make some pessimal behaviors more likely.
I'm curious -- does NTFS implement sparse files?  Does the Win32 API
provide any way to manipulate them?  Does the NT kernel have any sparse
file handling?
