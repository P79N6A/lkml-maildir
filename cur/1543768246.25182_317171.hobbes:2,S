Here is what I thought you were suggesting for the updater:
	Remove item from list
	Send IPIs to all CPUs, relying on exact interrupts (which might
		not be present on all CPUs) to serialize the instruction
		streams of the other CPUs
	Wait for all IPIs to complete
	Wait until there are no hazard pointers referencing the item
		before freeing.
For the traverser:
	1. allocate hazard pointer (SW engr problem: what to do if
		allocation fails?  If deeply nested, holding locks, &c?)
	2. retry:
	3. Pick up pointer, store into hazard pointer.
	4. Tell the compiler not to reorder memory references across this point
	5. If hazard pointer does not match the pointer, goto retry.
	6. begin critical section
If the updater and traverser run concurrently, the interrupt forces
serialization -- look at all the possible interleavings to see this:
1.	Before this point, the traverser cannot see the removed element.
2.	Ditto.
3.	Ditto.
4.	Before this point, the traverser might have stored a pointer to
	the remove element into the hazard pointer, but will see the 
	disappearance when it returns from interrupt.
5.	Ditto.
6.	At this point, the hazard pointer has been set, and the
	interrupt will force memory ordering.
Similar reasoning when the traverser NULLs the hazard pointer.
Or am I missing something?  Or is there some CPU that Linux supports that
does inexact interrupts?
I must admit that I am not completely comfortable with this approach -- it
needs to be beaten up pretty thoroughly with both testing and theoretical
analysis.  And there might well be a flaw in my reasoning above.  ;-)
							Thanx, Paul
