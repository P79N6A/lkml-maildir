Well, it is there in 2.4.2 acquirewdt.c (which this driver is based on -
really only minimal changes, the hardware is only slightly different).
I can remove it if you tell me it's really not necessary.

Again, acquirewdt.c doesn't do it with the misc_register, request_region
and register_reboot_notifier calls.  (Should it?  Cc: Alan Cox)
