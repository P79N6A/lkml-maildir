Hello!
   I sent SIGTERM to my postgres process and it logged:
DEBUG:  Data Base System shutting down at Sun Mar 19 11:12:52 2000
DEBUG:  Data Base System shut down at Sun Mar 19 11:12:52 2000
NOTICE:  IPCPrivateMemoryKill: shmctl(131076, 0, 0) failed: Invalid argument
  After that there is no way to get complete ps output. ps just hangs.
  And there is no way to kill that postgres process even with kill -9 pid.
  Big red button press required :-\
Bye,
    oleg
