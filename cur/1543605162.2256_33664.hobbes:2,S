I'm not a kernel hacker either, but I wonder what happens when you
scale your buffers above and below your ranges.  I.e. what happens
with 1k, 2k, 4k, 128k, 256k buffers?  Do you get a linear (or at least
a smooth curve) change between these values?
I also wonder about whether using TCP vs. UDP packets over sockets
makes any difference in your testing.  More tests for you to write and
do, but it might help narrow down where the bad interaction is really
happening.
Good luck,
John
