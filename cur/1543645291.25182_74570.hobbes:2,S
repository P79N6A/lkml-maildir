As I said:  you're not seeing "this problem".  And it's not a BUG().
So now we agree ... ;-)
You might try sending the full oops report to the maintainer
of that driver, or at least to the linux-usb-devel list.
(The 2.5.39 code gives more info than you snipped...)  So far
as I know, this problem has not been reported there.
