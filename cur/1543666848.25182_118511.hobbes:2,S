I don't think phase three is really needed...
It sounds reasonable, but if it's mainly due to space consuption, I
think it would be nice to code a bzip2-to-gz cgi server so that there is
no loss on functionality. This would need CPU power, so perhaps
rate-limiting the sending side of the CGI would manage to keep
the CPU low on use.

Don't know.
Greets anyways, Antonio.
