security_kernel_act_as()

It would get a context from the client or from a local configuration
that would map security-unaware clients to a default context, and then
want to assume that context for the particular operation.  No transition
involved.

can be set differently for different policy types (strict, targeted,
mls).
Naturally, cachefiles (the kernel module) would invoke a security hook
to check whether the daemon is allowed to set the specified context.

Yes, but I think I disagreed then too.

It doesn't fit with how other users of security_kernel_act_as() will
likely want to work (they will want to just set the context to a
specified value, whether one obtained from the client or from some local
source), nor with how type transitions normally work (exec, with the
program type as the second type field).  I think it will just cause
confusion and subtle breakage.
