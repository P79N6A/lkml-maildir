Subject: [PATCH] 2.4: BUG_ON (1/2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Marcelo and Alan,
The attached patch adds 2.5's BUG_ON construct to the 2.4 kernel.  This
is done to facilitate portability and back-porting 2.4 <=> 2.5, because
BUG_ON is a very readable construct, and because it is a small
optimization over standard BUG.
For the unaware,  BUG_ON(condition) is basically
        if (unlikely(condition) != 0) BUG();
This is not really about sprinkling BUG_ONs everywhere but helping
backporting.  And I like BUG_ON :)
This patch is against 2.4.19-pre5, but also applies to 2.4.19-pre4-ac3. 
Alan and Marcelo - please apply.
