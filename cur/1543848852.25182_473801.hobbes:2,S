YH I have to grumble at you, your patch suffers from white space damage
and does not apply.
In addition while looking this version is actually broken because
for retrigger irq we only ever want to send the irq once and your
version has the potential to be broadcast to several cpus.  Not
what we want.
I will send a fixed version in a minute.
