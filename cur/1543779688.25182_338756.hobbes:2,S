good that I didn't expect that then.
I think it's fair enough to ask people if they can use it. If the answer
is "No because it doesn't fit our model <here>" then that's fine. If the
answer is "eh yeah we could" then I think it's entirely reasonable to
expect people to use common code as opposed to adding new code.
