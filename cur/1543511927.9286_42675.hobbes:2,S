Do you have anything that monitors temperature on your system?
I had similar lockups on a dual-SMP and found out my 2nd CPU was overheating
and was causing lockups.
Removing the 2nd CPU fixed my lockup problems.  And, putting in two new CPUs
also fixed it (Duall PIII/500 now running for 5 days).

Subject: 2.2.13pre15 SMP+IDE test summary
This is the summary of my SMP+IDE tests, done with several kernels. The
important ones however were all done with the same 2.2.13pre15 kernel
binary.
The following with 2.2.13pre15 SMP kernel (for applied patches see below):
what didn´t work:
(1) dual P3 machine: kernel up for 10 mins, rm of two large files, result:
NULL dereference in unlink() (see other message)
(2) dual P3 machine: stress test on all five drives (on three controllers),
result: hard lockup after four hours (no oops etc.)
what works (I moved the 2 promise controllers and the 4 raid hds to a single
CPU machine):
(3) dual P3 machine: stress test on onboard-controller-hda only: works for
15 hours, still running
(4) single P3 machine: exactly the same test as (2), but also works for 15
hours, still running
As mentioned, (1) to (4) with the same (SMP) kernel binary.
One more pre15 test:
2.2.13pre15 with Unified IDE 2.2.13pre14-19991003 (two rejects in ide.c, one
ok, one probably harmless):
(5) dual P3 machine: NULL deref after 6 hours (i.e. this pre15 kernel
survived longest)
Earlier test to check if the dual P3 hardware works reliable with non-SMP
kernel:
(6) 2.2.13pre14+raid+large-disk+spinlock-patch-nonSMP: worked for 15 hours,
then I stopped it
Earlier tests (all on the dual P3 machine):
(7) 2.2.13pre14+UnifIDE-13pre12-19990925+raid+large-disk+spinlock-patch:
worked for 6 hours, then NULL oops
(8) 2.2.13pre14+raid+large-disk: hard lockup after 30 mins
(9) 2.2.13pre14+raid+large-disk+spinlock-patch: hard lockup after 2.5h
I can think of these possible reasons for the SMP problems:
(A) SMP race(s) in IDE driver in original 2.2.13pre15
(B) SMP-deadlock in raid-2.2.11-patch
(C) problem with large disk patch (unlikely)
(D) hardware issue (seems unlikely since all works well with non-SMP kernel
or machine)
Anyway, I´ll finally use the single P3 machine for the raid and export it to
the SMP machine via NFS.
Probably Red Hat or someone else with enough resources should do some
intensive SMP+IDE+RAID testing. Red Hat ships raid anyway, and people are
tempted to use IDE drives (think of the "i" in "raid"). If they do so on a
SMP machine, this may be a problem.
Further remarks:
- the test program writes pseudo random data with multiple processes and
verifies during read-back. In all tests there was no single data error.
- unlink(): I later added a remove() to the test program (after
read+verify), but the unlink-oops didn´t occur again with 2.2.13pre15. The
oops may not be directly unlink()-related (eventually to process
startup/finish, I had a similar oops with an earlier kernel
>=2.2.12+UnifiedIDE with many processes terminating, while unlink()s were in
progress). This seems not related to multiple drives (assuming that
mduponch@cisco.com only uses one hd)
- the oopses are attached to my earlier messages, if necessary I can send
more info about hardware etc.
2.2.13pre15 kernel patches:
- raid 2.2.11
- large disk patch (for raid5 IBM 37GB drives)
- small cheat in pci.h to make kernel believe the promise66 controllers are
promise33
- tasks.h: 4000
- compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3
- max files increased via proc (but there never were many files concurrently
open)
- no unified ide patch for (1) to (4)
hardware:
- SMP, dual p3-450
- 2 x promise UDMA66
- 25GB drive as hda, on onboard controller as single master
- 37GB drives at hde, hdf, hdi, hdj
