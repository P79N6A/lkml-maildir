XP boot: No good if before 2.6.13 runs on the hardware
and do the normal shuttdown or reboot or power off.
The same for all linux kernel before 2.6.13 (tested
2.6.12, 2.6.11)

a litle bit confusing, just one line to describe it:
If run 2.6.13 and up the NIC, it is working. Shuttdown
or reboot using /sbin/halt (means power completely off
and on) or /sbin/reboot all other OSs failed to enable
the NIC except 2.6.13.
to restore the normal working of the NIC, boot 2.6.13
and do a hot power reset. (press the reset button)
cheers
