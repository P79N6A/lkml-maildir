     It has only been intended for output to a TCP stream socket.
To be honest, I'm not so sure about this.
For example, I definitely see us supporting this in the
opposite direction when commodity 10gbit hits the market.
Initially I thought "sys_receivefile()" but it makes no
sense when we have a system call that is perfectly capable
of describing the tcp_socket --> page_cache operation.
And I don't think the vfs copy operation using sendfile
is such a bad thing either.  It definitely opens the door
for some interesting optimizations.  For example, if the
source page is not mapped by a process it could be possible
to just unhash it, mark it dirty, then hash it into the
destination file.  Exactly 2 I/O operations and the cpu
doesn't touch the data at all.
