My preference would be to only add the "---" line
when starting with a brand new, empty patch file.
If an existing version of the patch file exists,
then just copy over the entire header (up to the
first actual patch) as is, no change.  If I choose
to edit the patch file header and remove the "---"
line, or do any other edit to it (short of creating
a line that looks like the start of a patch) then
quilt should respect that.
The following patch seems to accomplish this.
