Calm down please.
I did not assume anything. You posted as "Vishal Linux", this is a
hard fact. I also did not judge you in any way. I merely *suggested* a
change, in your own interest.
The way people on this list perceive you will decide whether they are
going help you or not. Naming yourself "Vishal Linux" suggests that you
are the only person on Earth with first name "Vishal" who is entitled
to be related with the Linux kernel in any way. We expect more humility
from newcomers.
Additionnally, it's much easier to deal with the real names. There are
litterally thousands people posting to the LKML every year, having to
deal with nicknames or first names only makes it very hard to remember
who is who.

This is a technical detail. You can still post as "Vishal Soni" using
this second email address. I invite you do to so.
Now, feel free to ignore my suggestion. Just like I'll feel free to
ignore any further post from "Vishal Linux", especially if said post
includes slang, random insults, and abuses ellipsis.

There is no function by that name in that file, neither in Linus'
latest kernel, nor in Andrew Morton's one. Whatever you are talking
about does not seem to exist.

You're welcome.
