The guy seems to have some personal agenda, posting specifics would ruin
his otherwise fine troll.

Precisely.

Yep, at some point in a release schedule you have to stop blindly
merging patches from upstream -mm and -linus. But lots of patches are
bug fixes which were "back ported" (really just merged) from Linus or
your kernel.
And then at some point you start over, merge up, and get rid of these
(almost) thousands of patches.

A lot of the patches are already in -mm or -linus later versions. I'm
sure once crunch time is over more patches will get merged upstream, but
I do think that we have been a _lot_ better at merging with 2.6 than
previously.
The last thing anyone wants is the situation we had/have with (basically
all) 2.4 vendor kernels.
