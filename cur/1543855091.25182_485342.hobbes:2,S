Why even leave it there?
Can't we do something as follows, which has already been suggested in
the patch description:
Each hotcpu aware subsystem defines the hotcpu_mutex as follows
#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
[static] DEFINE_MUTEX(my_hotcpu_mutex);
#endif
That way, we won't be having any unneeded mutexes at all.

Yup, this won't work. Wish we could cook up something like this, but
alas! Most of these mutexes are defined with the static keyword,
which causes compile errors with CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n.
