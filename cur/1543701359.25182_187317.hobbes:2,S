With 2.6.1-rc1 I have noticed a strange IDE performance change.
Results of "hdparm -t /dev/hda" with 2.6.0 kernel:
(readahead = 256):		~26.31 MB/s
(readahead = 128):		~31.82 MB/s
PS = readahead is set to 256 by default on my system, 128 seems to be the 
best value
Results of "hdparm -t /dev/hda" with 2.6.1-rc1 kernel:
(readahead = 256):		~26.41 MB/s
(readahead = 128):		~26.27 MB/s
Setting readahead to 128 doesn't have the same effect with the new kernel...

I don't understand how this happens... the only changes to IDE driver seems 
to be these:

For my tests I have used this stupid shell script:
#!/bin/bash
echo "HD test for linux `uname -r`"
echo
ra=8
for i in `seq 12`; do
    echo "READAHEAD = $ra";
    hdparm -a $ra /dev/hda;
    for j in `seq 3`; do
	hdparm -t /dev/hda;
    done;
    ra=$(($ra*2));
done
Results for 2.6.0 && 2.6.1-rc1 are attached.
Bye
