I am planning to write or patch some drivers to do this as well as other
things. 
I would want to add things at run time after the module is alreaded loaded.
So options to the module won't work.
I don't know how to use ifconfig to create a new device.
Any examples of drivers and apps that do this cleanly. The ones I have
seen are not.
