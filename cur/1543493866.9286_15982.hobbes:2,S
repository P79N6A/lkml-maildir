	No, please also answer to the list, I'm interested in the answer,
too.
	- Where can somebody find information about net-pf-x?
Look in include/linux/socket.h.  Start at the definition of AF_UNSPEC,
around line 144.
For example, if (like me) you accidentally failed to include "Unix domain
sockets" when building the kernel, and as a result get lots of modprobe
errors trying to find net-pf-1, you can see from the file that pf ("protocol
family", I guess) 1 is AF_UNIX, with a helpful comment.
Yet another example where having the source saves reading a lot of
documentation!
