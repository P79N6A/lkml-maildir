Hi:
   I'm reading the codes about linux memory managemnet. and now
I'm puzzled by some codes about __bootmem_alloc_core.
   This function can return a memory address for a memory block.
and it has a parameter "goal" with it to get a preferred address.
But when prev call of this function get a memory block < PAGE_SIZE,
and then call this function with parameter goal and cause
start != bdata->last_pos+1 , the perv memblock has not been 
marked reserved and the info will be lost. 
   I'm not sure can this happened?
   Thanks.
__best regards__
                                            jason
