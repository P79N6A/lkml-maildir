I honestly think that the barrier has been more political
in nature than technical. I don't know how long you've been
watching, but no attempt to get an LSM upstream has escaped
exagerated cricism from certain factions. Only someone who wants
to get cut to metaphorical ribbons would submit a little LSM.
Maybe that will get better now. I sure hope so.
