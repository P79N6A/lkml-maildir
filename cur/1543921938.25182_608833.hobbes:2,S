Indeed. This is a common enough problem that not including it causes more pain
than its worth.  I have two affected boxes myself that I actually thought
the hardware was dead before I tried ajax's patch.
People aren't going to report this as a bug. They aren't going to try out patches,
they're going to do what I did and stick another network card in the box and
go on with life.
Our users deserve better than this.
