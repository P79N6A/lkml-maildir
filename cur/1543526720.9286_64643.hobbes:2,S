   Note I've been having exactly the same trouble with IDE CD and
   2.3.46. It seems to be due to PIIX tuning or IDE auto DMA. Drive
   works fine with 2.2.x (up to 2.2.15pre9). i686 UP, Red Hat 6.1 +
   binutils-2.9.5.0.27; various compilers tried (egcs-1.1.2-24 (RH),
   gcc-2.95.2, late egcs snapshots)
I don't think the bug is someone in my area any more.
If there were a bug in the PCI mapping changes, it would
just BUG_TRAP on you and give a dump, not lockup.
Could you kindly remove me from the CC: list until there is
evidence to suggest that I need to get involved again?  Thanks.
Later,
