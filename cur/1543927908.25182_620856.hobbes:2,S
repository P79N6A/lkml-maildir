It most certainly does not. gcc will assume that an int* has int alignment. memcpy() is a builtin, which gcc can translate to pretty much anything. And C specifies that a pointer to foo, will point to a real object of type foo, so gcc can't be blamed for the unsafe typecasts. I have tested this the hard way, so this is not just speculation.
E.g., we have the following struct:
struct foo
{
	u8 a[4];
	u32 b;
};
This struct will have a size of 8 bytes and an alignment of 4 bytes (caused by the member b). Now take the following code:
void copy_foo(struct foo *dst, struct foo *src)
{
	*dst = *src;
}
On a platform that supports 64-bit loads and stores (e.g. AVR32, where I got hit by this), this will generate:
	LD r1, (src)
	ST r1, (dst)
Now if I replace that with:
void copy_foo(struct foo *dst, struct foo *src)
{
	memcpy(dst, src, sizeof(struct foo));
}
then it will generate the same code. So I cannot use copy_foo() to transfer a struct foo either out of, or into a packet buffer.
In other words, memcpy() does _not_ save you from alignment issues. If you cast from char* or void* to something else, you better be damn sure the alignment is correct because gcc will assume it is.
