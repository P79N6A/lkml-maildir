That's still the fast path on any machine where this matters.
If the system uses sysenter, it won't matter because we reload TF by hand. 
And if it uses "int 0x80" through the trampoline, it won't matter, because 
the "lost" instruction is part of the trampoline, and not "important" for 
the debuggee. I think it's a "ret" instruction that gets lost, so the only 
thing that happens is that the person "magically" returns to the caller. 
If that's a problem (for "finish" or other logic), I'd be ok with adding a 
"nop" to the vsyscall thing. That would have less of an impact than adding 
the test to the kernel path..
So the _only_ case your patch matters is for old-style binaries that use 
"int 0x80" inline, and there that path is indeed the hot-path.

I bet that if you really search, you cna probably find _some_ OS out there
that considered the Intel behaviour a bug, and fixed it with something
like your patch. But I bet it's not just Linux and BSD that use the Intel
behaviour, just because it's such a pain _not_ to.
