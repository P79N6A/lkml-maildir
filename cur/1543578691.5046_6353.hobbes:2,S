This sounds like a totally different thing than the DMA corruption - this
sounds like you just got CRC error messages, and the driver still did the
right thing? 
The 82c586 corruption seems to be silently just writing (and maybe
reading) bad data to the disk.
The case of CRC errors and recivering from them (or fixing them with a
good cable) is different - when the CRC errors are noticed, they cause the
command to be re-tried and thus no data corruption should occur.
Basically it's the difference between being "silently bad" and "noisily
good". Sounds like you are in the "noisily good" category - a category
that I don't worry about ;)
