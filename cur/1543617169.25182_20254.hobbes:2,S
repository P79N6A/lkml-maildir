Very few hardware vendors give out kernel patches... if any.  The end
user method of choice I've seen is a tarball with files to build, or a
single .c file to build.  Kernel autoconfiguration for vendor drivers
rarely comes into play, because the driver is built against the "current
kernel" headers, but not with the standard kernel build system and
tools.
Oh, and is Penelope single?
