This doesn't make sense. You just need to count your way through the received
samples as you run them through the tone detector That gives you the cadence
precisely. Its both more accurate and more efficient than any other strategy.
There are no scheduling issues on the receive side at all. You just need to
keep up, and not drop samples.
