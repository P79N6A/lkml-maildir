Is there a way when compiling the kernel to tell it how to handle the
swap memory..... ok this is what i'm trying to do.
When my box get's large memory needs it starts using swap... When the
computer goes back down to normal memory usage i want all the swap put
back into ram ... as ram becomes avaliable. Even if i'm not tring to
access the memory in the swap at the time. i'd be interested in more
information about this... or pro/cons of doing so...
Thanks
Dan
