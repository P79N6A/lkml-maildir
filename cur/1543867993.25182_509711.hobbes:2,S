Well you shouldn't need to wait just run with a kernel with NR_IRQS >= 1024.
1024 is stretch but it isn't to bad.  There are already x86 boxes that have
more pins on their ioapics then that. So x86_64 and with this latest
round of patches from Len Brown and I i386 should be able to support that.
On the other side 1024 looks extremely limiting for exposing pci devices.  
If someone gets serious about pushing what is legal with MSI-X you may be
in trouble.  As a single device is allowed to have 4096 interrupts.   Not
that I can think of a user for so many but...
