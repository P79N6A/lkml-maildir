Not xterm, at least.
Not gnome-terminal either, for that matter.
I just tried.
	LESS=FRS git diff
clears the screen and leaves the thing at the end.
	LESS=FRSX git diff
works fine, but for people who _like_ the alternate screens (and I do, 
once I really use a pager) it also disables the alternate screen.
It might depend on the termcap, of course. I'm running FC5.
