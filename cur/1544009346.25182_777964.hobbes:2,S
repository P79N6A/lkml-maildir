which video driver are you using?
While your HW might be defective (MCE's tend to indicate that), if it's
software dependent it might also indicate that something, usually a
video driver, gets the system in a really bad state.
Also, make sure that you have MCE enabled in both kernels (I'm sure you
do, but it's one of those things worth double checking)
