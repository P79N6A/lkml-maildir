I don't really have any fundamental opposition.  I'm just trying to make
sure that there's not a simpler (better) way of doing it.  You've
obviously thought about it a lot more than I have, and I'm trying to
understand your process.
As far as the execution speed with a simpler system call.  Yes, it will
likely be slower.  However, I'm not sure that the increase in scan time
is all that significant compared to the migration code (it's pretty
slow).
