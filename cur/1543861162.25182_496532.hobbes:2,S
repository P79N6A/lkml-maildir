preempt_disable() can't prevent cpu_up, but flush_workqueue() doesn't care
_unless_ cpu_down also happened meantime (and hence a fresh CPU may have
pending work_structs which were moved from a dead CPU).
So you are right, we still need the patch above, but I think we don't have
new problems with preempt_disable().
I might have missed your point though.
Oleg.
