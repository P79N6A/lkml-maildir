Ted Tso pointed something out at Expo we'd missed. There is a problem with
using poll() as there is no "changed since last time" case. That means there
is no way to do
{
	if(its_changed()
		do_thing
	poll()
}
as the poll won't be working for "since last poll".
SIGIO instead is the model that is uglier but probably right - especially now
we have rt signals that pass the fd back
