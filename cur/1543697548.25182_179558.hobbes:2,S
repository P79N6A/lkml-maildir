Hi,
Thanks for the testing.  I don't think pnp-fix-4.patch should affect this problem.
I will probably be creating a blacklist for PnPBIOS systems that have this bug.
Currently, I'm waiting to see if reading static resources has any positive affects
on some additional systems.  If not then I may switch back to the the original
behavior.  DMI information for your system would be helpful.
Thanks,
Adam
