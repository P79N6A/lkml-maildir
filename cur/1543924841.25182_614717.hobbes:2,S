Yes, but, what is this file doing mucking around in a "private" variable
to the driver core?  No wonder I never caught this, as it's one
reference away from being declared static.
Please fix this file up properly, like the comment in vio.c shows:
	 * XXX once vio_bus_type.devices is actually used as a kset in
	 * drivers/base/bus.c, this function should be removed in favor of
	 * "device_find(kobj_name, &vio_bus_type)"
The fact that this function works at all is so tenous and scary that I
would never trust it on a running system.  Let alone something so
"enterprise" as a pseries box...
thanks,
greg k-h
