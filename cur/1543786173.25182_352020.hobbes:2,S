Does it still drop packets when only running at
15% utilization?
Did you run data streams through the box while
doing these tests? There's a difference between
gaining performance in a benchmark and just
shifting performance from one activity to
another. If the latter is the case, then there's
been no progress at all. I keep seeing all these
great benchmark results, and linux keeps dropping
more and more packets as the versions increase.
Its become practically unusable as a specialized
networking appliance.
