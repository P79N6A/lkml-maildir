Subject: [PATCH] cciss 2.6: pci domain info pass 2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is pass 2 of my patch to add pci domain info to an existing ioctl. This time I insert the domain between dev_fn and board_id as Willy suggested and change the var to unsigned short to ease Christoph's concerns. Although I thought unsigned int was the correct var type for this. I also thought it didn't matter where I inserted it in the structure.
