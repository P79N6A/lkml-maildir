I just took out the second processor and re-ran the tests. It's just done
its third run and all's well. Wierd. I'm going to swap processors over
(take out the "good" processor and put in the "bad" processors and see if
the errors happens. If it does, there's the culprit. If not, it has to be
something that goes wrong when both processors are in the system.
Anyone seen this hardware problem in the past? Motherboard is a Supermicro
P6DNF if that's relevant. 
Cheers, 
Alex
