Even though you are trying to withdraw this message (which is pointless
for something sent to a mailing list), I had a few small questions with
regards to PCI Hotplug devices:

Oops, your patch wrapped, please try another email client, or change the
configuration options of your current one.

Hm, wierd indenting style, can you just follow Documentation/CodingStyle
and use tabs?
Anyway, what code is supposed to use this function?  A PCI Hotplug
controller driver?  If so, do you have any patches to the current
drivers that show how it is used?
Also, why pass a void *?  That's usually forbidden in the kernel, and
since you are instantly casting it to a struct pci_dev *, why not just
use that?
thanks,
