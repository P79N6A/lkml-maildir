Unfortunately I've gone and applied a huge driver update from Erich, so
none of this applies any more.
A recut would be appreciated.  Please include your additional suggestions:
16. Tab size in Linux kernel is 8 (not less).
17. Don't put changelog comments in source files.  That's what
     SCMs are for (source code manager tools).
18. Put arcmsr.txt in Documentation/scsi/, not in scsi/arcmsr/.
19. Maybe use sysfs (/sys) instead of /proc.
In the updated changelog, thanks.
