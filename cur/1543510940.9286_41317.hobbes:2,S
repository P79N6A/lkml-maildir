While I haven't written this down in detail, I've been consistent in this 
answer for over a year.  
BitKeeper uses open logging of your change comments on host[s] in the
openlogging.org domain.  When/after we release 1.0, there will be a
web server on bitkeeper.openlogging.org where you can go to browse the
change logs.
The presence of that web server - and it's active updating - is a
requirement for the !GPL license.  If that web server/domain/etc go away
for a continuous period of 6 months (with all the restrictions like
it can't be because California fell into the ocean), then the source
becomes GPLed.
In other words: if whatever corporation which happens to own the rights
to BK no longer cares enough to maintain the business model, or if they
have gone out of business, then you get it under the GPL.
Good enough?
