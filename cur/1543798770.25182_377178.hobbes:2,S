There are lots of nfs mounts, the root is ro nolock, but the trouble is
with the home directories which are rw lock.  Everything is still
mounted, I can ssh in fine etc.  The problem is with people using kde -
it tries to lock some file in the home directory during the login
process and hangs.

No, 2.6.14.2.
