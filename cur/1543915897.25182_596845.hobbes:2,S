Actually, that whilst that is sort of feasible for CacheFiles[*], it is not
really feasible for NFSd.  NFSd possesses a set of daemons that have a
standard objective context and substitute a lot of different subjective
contexts as they perform VFS operations on behalf of remote clients.
  [*] But in practice quite icky from other points of view.
