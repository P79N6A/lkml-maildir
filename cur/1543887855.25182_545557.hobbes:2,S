The reason to do it early is so that we can still get a message out if
the CPU doesn't have the necessary features.  This is generic code and
not specific to CX8.
Since I'm rewriting the setup code in C, I have added code to enable
features on VIA and Transmeta CPUs (there was already code in there to
enable features on AMD; Intel isn't known to hide any features other
than PAE on 400 MHz FSB Pentium-M.)
I think the early feature detection makes good sense.  It's a heckuva
lot nicer to get a message on your screen saying that you can't boot
this kernel on this CPU than a crash, or an early_printk which may never
actually get to you.
