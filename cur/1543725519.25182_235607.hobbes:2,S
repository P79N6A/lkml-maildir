i did not say latency sources, i said unpredictable latency sources. 
hardirq and softirq processing introduces near arbitrary latency at any
(irqs-enabled) point in the kernel. Hence they make all kernel code
unbound in essence - even the most trivial kernel code, sys_getpid().
by (optionally) moving softirqs and hardirqs to a process context we've
removed this source of uncertainty by making all processing synchronous,
and what remains are ordinary algorithmic properties of the kernel code
- which we can predict and control. I.e. with those two fixed we now
have a _chance_ to guarantee latencies.
[the only remaining source of 'latency uncertainty' is the small
asynchronous hardirq stub that would still remain. This has an effect
that can be compared to e.g. cache effects and it cannot become unbound
unless the CPU is bombarded with a very high number of interrupts.]

what are those few places where a spinlock was really needed?
I'm a bit uneasy about making mutexes the default not due to performance
but due to e.g. some hardware being very timing-sensitive. I dont think
we can make a blanket assumption that every code path is preemptable if
all processing is synchronous and the exclusions are listened to.
