Yeah, I don't know what the right solution is.
Especially with renames (but even without), diffstat-like output can get 
some _really_ long lines, and since I think it's important to get the 
actual _stat_ part to line up (so that you can really see where the big 
changes are), I felt it was more important to get that lining up than it 
was to see the first part of the filename.
But yeah, we should probably have a flag to allow longer (and shorter) 
lines, and another to control whether we truncate to strictly honor that 
flag or not.
That said, I think the current behaviour is likely at least the right 
default one. It's quite readable once you get used to it, and the renames 
do _not_ get truncated in the "summary" part at the end, since then there 
is nothing to line up with.
So for an example of this, just do
	git show --summary --stat -M 06a36db1
where you have an already fairly long pathname that is then renamed to 
_another_ long pathname.
