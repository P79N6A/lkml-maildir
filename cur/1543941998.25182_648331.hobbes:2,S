That depends on the enclosure integration, but right at the moment, it
doesn't

Not an application so much as a user.  The idea of sysfs is to allow
users to get and set the information in addition to applications.

I must have missed that when I was looking for implementations; what's
the URL?
But, if we have non-scsi enclosures to integrate, that makes it harder
for a user application because it has to know all the implementations.
A sysfs framework on the other hand is a universal known thing for the
user applications.

The same thing goes for other esoteric SCSI infrastructure pieces like
cd changers.  On the whole, given that ATA is asking for enclosure
management in kernel, it makes sense to consolidate the infrastructure
and a ses ULD is a very good test bed.
