Dear Kernel devels,
I have a doubt about the block driver concepts.
Why do I need the check_media_change & revalidate if interrupt is there.
I mean, if my removable media controller generates interrupts whenever the card is inserted or removed, why will I need a additional check like check_media_change & revalidate .
I can always handle the media change through the ISR. Right.
Can someone explain why really I would need these additional functions?
Regards,
Mukund Jampala
