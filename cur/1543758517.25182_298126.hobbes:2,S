  Oh, Bartlomiej, one more thing.
  If it isn't too much trouble, can you please set up a bk repository 
which contains the patches you've posted and whatever you're working on 
but hasn't yet made into ide-dev tree?  So that we don't have to juggle 
patches back and forth.  If you maintain your up-to-date working tree, 
I'll make my patches against that tree and if it's convinient for you, I 
can also set up an export tree you can pull from.
  Thanks.  :-)
