- From a users point of view: if there are only to be framebuffer devices listed 
in this class, why not call it just what it is: "Framebuffer" ? Naming it 
after something it is only in a broad sense makes no sense to me. I'd be 
looking in /sys/.../framebuffer instead of /sys/.../graphics or /display.
Display would be the EDID info of my screen (physical), and graphics... 
well... I'd half expect something like capture cards to be there...
Just my 0.02EUR.
