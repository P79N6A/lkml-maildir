Smaller than the kernel, but still big.  These are not 55 bytes.
And the kernel headers are not unique either.  You can make
many changes and still be able to use them for a driver.

Many of these interfaces are published.  Buy a linux device driver
book and write your own headers - possibly with different names
for the types involved.  Structs or just a bunch of variables in a
certain order?  Your call again.  You won't get everything this way,
but you don't need everything to write one driver.
Then there is reverse engineering.  More work, but certainly
feasible seeing how many linux drivers were written this way.
