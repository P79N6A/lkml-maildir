SC1200 power managment looks sane. Questions:
Don't you need to wait for current operation to complete before
calling sc1200_spindown_drive?
I noticed you are not playing any tricks with inserting requests to
queues... This is basically what I was doing, so I like it.
Is sc1200_spindown_drive really sc1200 specific? Is there some problem
with doing suspend at ide.c layer, and resume (which is controller
specific) in each driver?
...Ugh. You are doing it as pci device, not as generic device. I
believe you should use sysfs directly.
Anyway I can live with this, and its way better than whats in there
just now.
