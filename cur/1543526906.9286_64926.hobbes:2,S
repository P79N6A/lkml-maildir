Subject: ifconfig||ip, impossible to bring interface up after setting interface down

using kernel 2.3.47, with either ifconfig or ip, once an interface has been
marked 'down', it can not be brought up again.  requested action brings:
router:~# ip l s eth2 up
router:~# ip l s eth2 down
router:~# ip l s eth2 up
SIOCSIFFLAGS: No such device
router:~# ip l s eth2 mtu 1476
SIOCSIFMTU: No such device
router:~# ip a a 127.0.0.2 brd + dev eth2
router:~# ip a s eth2
8: eth2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100
    link/ether 00:80:c8:1d:37:fc brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 127.0.0.2/32 scope global eth2
router:~# ip a f eth2
router:~# ip a s eth2
8: eth2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100
    link/ether 00:80:c8:1d:37:fc brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
from this point on, addresses can be added or removed but most flags or
options can not change.
