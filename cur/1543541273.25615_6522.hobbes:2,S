Mutt and emacs originally.  Basla 0.8 after that.  
Maybe you guys should just go get a mail reader that 
can do word wrapping FOR YOU, since doing it myself is
a royal pain in the ass since I ususally EDIT my emails
before sending them.  And have no trouble reading my
own mail.
Pray tell, what is the "standard" linux mail setup?  May
I be enlightened to the holy levels that the ubergeeks
on the list have achieved.
