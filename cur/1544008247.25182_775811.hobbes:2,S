Ok. The system now runs (without problems) with the patch enabled and I can 
get the debug output.
30 Minutes after boot the system still returns to zero dirty blocks and the 
free blocks seem to stay in a sensible range.
I will let it run for a while and report back if either something interesting 
happens or the problem reappears and I am seeing no significant amount of dirty 
blocks.
