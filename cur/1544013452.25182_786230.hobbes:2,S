Ah yes, this looks very right to me.

I must admit, I hate this ;)
That said, I agree with you point about compatibility. So I have to
agree with this change.
Still, I'd like to know what other people think ;)
And I also agree that xacct is linux specific feature, but I still
I dislike the fact that xacct and getrusage report different numbers.
Perhaps we should change xacct as well?

Perhaps it makes sense to factor out this code and make a helper?
Unfortunately, exit_mm() and exec_mmap() do not have the common
path which can update sig->maxrss, mm_release() can't do this...

Hmm... So, RUSAGE_THREAD always report maxrss == get_mm_hiwater_rss(mm)
and ignores signal->maxrss. Doesn't look right to me...
Unless I missed something, Jiris's patch was fine, but given that now
we inherit maxrss at exec(), signal->maxrss can have the "inherited"
value?
