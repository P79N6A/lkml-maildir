This particular usage in ppc has vmlinux is synchronisation point - this
way it is guaranteed that lib/zlib_inflate/ is not visited twice
concurrently.
So this will not break SuSE "make -j 5" builds.
And current kernel compile fine with make -j 32 (only report the last
couple of months was me re-introducing a warning - already fixed).
Only issue seems to be file-stamps with no more than one second
resolution - this may result in rebuild in second run - because
some .o have equal timestamps.
