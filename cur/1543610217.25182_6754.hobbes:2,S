Practical test when I pointed out that something needed to be done
(and I didn't see the code in mmput) both David & Rik didn't even
see the problem much less where it was worked around.  And neither
of the saw the code in mmput.  If people can look at the code
and see what is going on that is hard to follow, by definition.
The primary problem with swap_mm is that swap_mm is used totally
unexpectedly in a different file.  Instead of it's usage being small
local and contained.

There is some sense in allowing swapoff not to check new processes
but...  The only optimization that really makes sense with swapoff is
to turn it inside out and traverse each process only once...  With
possibly a little of the current logic to handle the shared swap case.
