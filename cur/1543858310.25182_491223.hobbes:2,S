Ok.  Which generally makes it uninteresting.  The only cases that I know
with a hard limit are completely unrouteable.
In addition upon reflection you don't handle PER_CPU irqs properly.  As
I recall ia64 uses a different per cpu irq source to target each
individual processor.  But because they are the same the share the
irq source.
I don't think allowed_affinity can even describe the case above.
