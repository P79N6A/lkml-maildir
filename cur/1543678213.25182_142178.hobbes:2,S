Team,
I also tried 2.5.70 kernel on the same system, the compiler error is the same (The message is "Unknown Pseudo-op:  '.incbin'").
Then I loaded these two kernels on another SuperMicro 2 PIII CPU system. It has RH Linux 9.0 (2.4.20-8) on it.  Both kernel compiled OK.  However, reboot with new kernel hung system at the point of:
Uncompressing Linux ... Ok, booting the kernel.
System boot won't proceed.  This happens to both 2.5.70 and 2.5.71.
The process of build and reboot new kernel is same as what I did for previous few kernel.  From 2.5.70 README file, this process doesn't seem to be changed.  I wonder someone may know the issue and have solution already.
Any help is appreciated!  Thanks!
Eddie
