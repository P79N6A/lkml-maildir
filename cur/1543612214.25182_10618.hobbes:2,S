I'd say that the normal current limit on SMP machines is 8 way.
But you're right, we don't agree.  Time will tell who was right.
When I say I'm interested in 16 way scalability, I'm not talking about
SMP, so perhaps we're talking at slightly cross purposes.

You seem to make this odd logical deduction quite a bit - you (or company X)
has tried concept X before. Their implementation didn't work. Therefore the
concept is bad. It's not particularly convincing as an argument style to others.
But I understand that it makes *you* want to try something else.
Martin.
