Also stupid.  People use a segfault handler on a signal stack,
*because* the previous stack may be broken.
Since any trick we try appears to (possibly) break some existing
software, the next idea is to add yet another flag to signal.h.  With
this, the user can decide whether he want to get extra safety or not.
Comments?
