Hi all,
I was asking this in gentoo-server mailing list before, however, they finally 
pointed me to this place as it could also be a bug in the kernel.
I'm having a TYAN board with two AMD Opteron 248 and 4x 1GB ECC RAM on it. The 
BIOS reflects what I've plugged in, however, the operating system does not.
my `uname -a` output is:
Linux battousai 2.6.11-gentoo-r8 #1 SMP Sat May 14 02:42:15 CEST 2005 x86_64 
AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 248 AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux
and my `dmidecode` output is located at [0]. For ANY reason, dmidecode even 
knows about my 4GB RAM, but `free -m` nor `kinfocenter` of KDE claims to see 
just 3GB.
free -m:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          3015       2993         22          0         15       2638
-/+ buffers/cache:        338       2677
Swap:          511          1        510
This is rather sad to see 1GB RAM plugged in for nothing.
Has anyone a hint for my WHY this is happening and HOW I could get rid of it?
Thanks in advance,
Christian Parpart.
