Because the interactivity of the system is better with less memory.

I see that. However, I don't see why the kernel is writing out data
as agressively as it does now. Delaying a write for 30 seconds isn't the
problem: the aggressive writes are. Since the disks are otherwise idle, the
kernel can gently start writing out the dirty cache. No need to try and
write 40 MB in 1 sec when you can write 10 MB/sec in 4 seconds.

I'm just reporting what's happening to me in practice, I don't really care
about what should happen in theory.
