It is, but that rounding gets done in reserve_bootmem() anyway, so there 
is no need for the arch-specific code to do it.
The 32-bit EBDA code hard-codes a size of 4K, which is probably equally 
wrong; my gut feel is that the right thing to do is to reserve from the 
EBDA up to the 640K mark (some BIOSes use an area like that for SMM 
stuff), possibly with some sanity checking.
