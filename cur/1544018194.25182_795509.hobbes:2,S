Hi, Alan.  Thanks for the reply.

What would you expect the driver to map RI and CD to?  I don't think
there are DTE->DCE signals that correspond to RI and CD.  Possibly
OUT1 and OUT2 could be used, since I don't think these are used
anywhere else in rfcomm, but this might be unintuitive.  I'll let
Marcel address that idea.
