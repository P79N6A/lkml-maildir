Huh?
Some systems are built without module support for numerous reasons.  I don't
need 50% of the entire kernel to get the box up, but I surely use it and I
don't want 100 modules loaded.  There is an introduced security weakness by
using kernels.  There are module races.  There are ...
So..what is the point in making it modular?  ..if it's in use the entire time
the machine is booted?
