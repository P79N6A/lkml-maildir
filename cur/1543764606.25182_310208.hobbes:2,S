I said diff between the trees, not diff between files ;). When you fetch
the new changes with rsync, it'll compress better and in turn it'll be
faster (assuming we're network bound and I am with 1mbit and 2.5ghz
cpu), if it's rsync applying gzip to the big "combined diff between
trees" instead of us compressing every single small file on disk, that
won't compress anymore inside rsync.
