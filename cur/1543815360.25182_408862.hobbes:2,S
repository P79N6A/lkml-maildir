    I can betatest it if you want, but anyway this is a reason as
good as any to switch my box to 2.6.x
    I don't find 2.6.x stable enough to run it on my box, but the
development model won't change in the near future, so I think I'll
have to live with that. I would love a backport, of course, but I
prefer to have an utf8 capable console.
    Thanks a lot for the patch :)
