Hi Dave,
it doesn't compile for me when CONFIG_SMP is set:
<--  snip  -->
...
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.5/linux-2.5.9/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common

-DKBUILD_BASENAME=sched  -fno-omit-frame-pointer -c -o sched.o sched.c
sched.c: In function `migration_thread':
sched.c:1685: `bind_cpu' undeclared (first use in this function)
sched.c:1685: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
sched.c:1685: for each function it appears in.)
sched.c: At top level:

It's the following part of the -dj1 patch (I've skipped the rest of the
sched.c changes):

 {
 	int cpu = cpu_logical_map((int) (long) bind_cpu);
 	struct sched_param param = { sched_priority: 99 };
The problem seems to be that "bind_cpu" is renamed to "unused" but it is
used two lines later.

time explaining its a free country because its a police state.
