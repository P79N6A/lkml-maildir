I get instant master aborts on Sparc64 with the es1371, but I think
this is because the card recognizes less than the full 32-bits of
address lines on PCI.
So the thing is basically useless to me, and I believe the alpha
platform issues have to do with es1371's bogus handling of some WRITE
pci transactions.
