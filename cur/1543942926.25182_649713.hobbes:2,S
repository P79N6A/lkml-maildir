We most certainly were not.  We are talking about Linux, and everybody
wants it be used globally.

Probably the same in Australia, for the same reason as in USA.  Probably
the same in most countries.

That's what you claim it says, but has any court, anywhere, agreed with
you?  You claim the authority of others (i.e. numerous lawyers), but I
don't believe you have that authority.  You're just starting hearsay. 
You've never said what lawyers and you've never told us what they
actually said.
I see that you have a clear political agenda, and I respect it in
principle, but you're claiming that things are so in pursuit of that
agenda when you don't *know* that they are.  You don't need to stretch
any truths to spread adoption of GPL, and doing so is not respectable.

I don't understand this, but I do understand that an essential question
being considered is whether or not Linux can participate in a market
that prohibits GPL drivers, whether explicitly, or more likely through
pressure from regulatory bodies.  Doing this would be a mistake. 
Probably a big one.
Don't telling people to switch to BSD, as some have done; they might do
it.  Where would Linux be if embedded devices used BSD instead?  Don't
think they can't.  Don't think Linux has a technical advantage.  Lose
the embedded market, and that's where it would be felt first, and Linux
volumes fall by what?  50%?  90%?  Would you care if servers followed?
