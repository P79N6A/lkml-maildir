If IRQ initialization is done incorrectly, it is possible
For a driver to request_irq(X), while the hardware is actually
on IRQ Y.
Then when that device becomes active, it would kill the other
devices on Y because its handler is looking for interrupts on X.
If this happens with acpi enabled, but doesn't happen with acpi=off
or pci=noacpi, then we need to compare the /proc/interrupts between
the working and failintg configs to see if the IRQs have moved around
when perhaps they should not have.  Dmesg from the ACPI case would
also be needed.

I believe this is due to transient hardware errors on your MB.
Though not fatal, it isn't a good indicator.
