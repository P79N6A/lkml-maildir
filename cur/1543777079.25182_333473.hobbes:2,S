Hello,
Today I tried 2.6.12.2 on an Asus A7V333 (socket A) with AMD Duron 1300 
MHz CPU and noticed, that the system clock was running about 60 times 
faster than real time and the keyboard was unresponsive. However, I was 
able to log in remotely and collect some standard debugging info (dmesg, 
lspci, interrupts, config), which is available at 
http://szpajder.w.staszic.waw.pl/a7v333/
 . Summary of my quick research 
follows:
- 2.6.12.1 works without problems
- 2.6.12.2 with acpi=off works without problems
- 2.6.12.2 with acpi_register_gsi() one-line fix works without problems
I was using Asus BIOS revision 1012 and also tried to upgrade to the 
latest 1017 with no luck.
