Subject: [patch] set kiobuf io_count once, instead of increment
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Currently in brw_kiovec, iobuf->io_count is being incremented as each
bh is submitted, and decremented in the bh->b_end_io().  This means
io_count can go to zero before all the bhs have been submitted,
especially during a large request. This causes the end_kio_request()
to be called before all of the io is complete.  
This suggested patch against 2.4.2 sets io_count to the total amount
before the bhs are submitted, although there is probably a better way
to determine the io_count than this.
