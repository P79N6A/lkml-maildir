Subject: [PATCH][2.6][Trivial] NFS Kconfig description correction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a resend of a trivial patch I've submitted earlier.
In the kernel help for NFSv3 & NFSv4 client support both are listed as 
"the newer version ... of the NFS protocol". 
Obviously both can't be the newer version at the same time, so here's a 
patch to correct the text in such a way that only v4 is listed as the 
newer version. Patch is against 2.6.8-rc3-mm1 - please consider applying.
