Because floating-point is not allowed in the kernel. If you are planning
to use floating-point within kernel code, don't. The state of the FPU
(if it exists) is undefined within the kernel. If the floating point
emulation is being used, you end up with the equivalent of a double-fault
if you attempt such.
