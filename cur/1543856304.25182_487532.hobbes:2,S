Doh!  I have a Tyan S2895 in my system, and I've been pulling my
hair out trying to track down the cause of a similar somewhat
rare failure for the pre-computer sha1 of a block of data to
actually match the calculated sha1.  I'd been hunting in vain the
past few days trying to find a cause -- looking for buffer
overflows, non thread safe code, or similar usual suspects.
It is a relief to see I am not alone!
