Windows 1.0 -> 2.0 -> 3.0 -> 3.1 -> 3.11 -> NT 3.5.1 -> 95 -> NT 4.0 -> 98
-> 2000
A little out of order? And why did they skip versions 6 - 94? ;-)
Versions 99-1999? I believe those were the betas of NT 5 ;-)
It gets even more confiusing when you add in WinCE (WINCE), then you have
repetitive versioning :)
