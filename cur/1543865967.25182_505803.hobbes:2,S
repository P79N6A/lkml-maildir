This code is currently completely Gujin specific.  If concieved as a
replacement for setup.S it has a chance of passing review.

Ok.  Similar restrictions to the current real mode code.

When you are relocatable no relocations are processed and all addresses in
the program header are slid by some fixed amount (preserving alignment)
after that the relocated object has to work out the relocations by itself.

LILO is a lot saner then Grub, and it still supports more filesystems...
Just because it memorizes it all before you shut down the system for
simplicity doesn't mean lilo is worse.

I have several times.  It's just code.  But I do agree it will likely
be more maintainable if we can convert it to C.
On that same token I wrote a compiler in romcc in another context so I
didn't have to write so much assembly.  And for maintainability and
comprehensibility it was a big help.
