This comment should be moved to the implementations of respective 
functions and be formatted as described by 
Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt. (We should eventually check all 
exported ieee1394 symbols if they are documented that way.)

Again, better no comment here than these two which are not very 
enlightening.
