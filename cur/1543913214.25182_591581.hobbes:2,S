I don't disagree with Geert's statement (the console was switching when
the console fonts got loaded during system initialization), but the
problem no longer exists in 2.6.23-rc5.  Weird.  N.B.: it could have
been fixed in 2.6.23-rc4, but I didn't try that kernel.  In any event,
I'll quit looking for the cause unless the problem recurs :-).
