Subject: No kernel works after pre-2.3.25-3 ! ( for me anyway )

The official kernel 2.3.25 and 2.3.26 would boot stay up for a while then
die suddenly without leaving any messages in the log files. None of the
2.3.27 even boot. It gets to the message "calibrating relay loops ....."
and hangs there. Here is the info from my system:
-- Versions installed: (if some fields are empty or look
-- unusual then possibly you have very old versions)
Linux genera 2.3.25 #1 Sun Oct 31 16:28:49 PST 1999 i486 unknown
Kernel modules         2.2.2-pre6
Gnu C                  2.96
Binutils               2.9.5.0.19
Linux C Library        2.1.3
Dynamic linker         ldd (GNU libc) 2.1.3
Procps                 1.2.6
Mount                  2.6a
Net-tools              1.50
Kbd                    0.99
Sh-utils               1.16
Modules Loaded         ppp_deflate bsd_comp ppp_async serial ppp_generic slhc
Whatever changed happened after pre-2.3.25-3, that is what I am running
now and it works great.

Thanks for any help,
