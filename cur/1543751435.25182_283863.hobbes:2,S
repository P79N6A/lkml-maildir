Hi...
I have lost my sensors info with 2.6.10, in particular -mm1.
They work fine with 2.6.9-mm1 (current state of the box, booted on
2.6.9 or 10, no other difference).
Some info follows.
With 2.6.9-mm1, I get this:
Module                  Size  Used by
w83627hf               25128  0

w83627thf-isa-0290
Adapter: ISA adapter
VCore:     +1.49 V  (min =  +1.93 V, max =  +1.93 V)

With 2.6.10-mm1:

sensors:
No sensors found!
I have noticed different contents in /sys:
under 2.6.9:
/sys/devices/platform/i2c-1:
/sys/devices/platform/i2c-1/1-0290:
/sys/devices/platform/i2c-1/1-0290/power:
/sys/devices/platform/i2c-1/power:
under 2.6.10:
/sys/devices/platform/i2c-1:
/sys/devices/platform/i2c-1/power:
So some /sys nodes are missing !!!
(the isa bus)
Debug output from 2.6.10-mm1:

Some ideas ?
