Indeed! Having this in the kernel would allow us to enable RT
scheduling for PulseAudio by default without bad effects. I was thinking about
adding some kind of babysitting process to userspace -- but doing this as
an RLIMIT in the kernel strikes me a much better idea!
I think it would make a lot of sense to make the API very similar to
RLIMIT_CPU, i.e. also send out SIGXCPU and SIGKILL, with the single
difference that RLIMIT_CPU sends out a signal depending on the total
CPU time used for the process and the new RLIMIT based on the time the
process spent without sleeping. That would be a very reasonable
extension to the current RLIMIT_CPU model.
Thank you very much for doing this patch!
Lennart
