Seem that you have to specify the "ip=bootp" options now
*     <PROTO>:
*        off|none         - don't do autoconfig at all (DEFAULT)
*        on|any           - use any configured protocol
*        dhcp|bootp|rarp  - use only the specified protocol
*        both             - use both BOOTP and RARP (not DHCP)
Anyway I'll do more investigation about my problem to get bootp
work with dhcp compiled into kernel next week
