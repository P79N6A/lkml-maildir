Larger sites have ingoing (MX) machines and outgoing (no MX) ones... this
is useless. And the whole SPF fiasco shows that such mechanisms (DNS based,
remote site publishes the data) are even easier to bypass (I've seen
statistics showing that the overwhelming mayority of SPF-"protected" email
is spam).
What does work rather well is greylisting (on first try tell them to come
back later, spammers rarely retry their junk).
Add blacklists (sadly, there are few reliable ones, AFAICS) and you cut it
down even more.
And yes, there is no silver bullet. This is an arms race, get a new
anti-spam device (filter configuration, ...) and soon they will figure out
how to bypass it.
In any case, I've seen claims that around 80% of email now is spam. That
it is still only a little in LKML says that the listmasters are doing an
oustanding job.
