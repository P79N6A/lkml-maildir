True.

But right now, the driver does not have enough information to make it a
driver specific decision. INT_LINE may not be enough to determine the
vector to claim for LSIs and "Message Data" may not be enough to
determine the vector to claim for MSIs. What is there is the irq field
in struct pci_dev.
The intent I had in making sure that MSGINT_MODE was set to match
PCI_MSI_FLAGS_ENABLE and making sure the capability was saved and
restored was to come as close as possible to the spec.
If it needs to be made a driver decision, there needs to be some way to
communicate the correct vector information for whichever option the
driver is using (if there already is and I missed it, please let me
know). Otherwise, it seems that trying to match spec behavior given the
hardware design or disabling MSI at config time for these devices (such
as through quirks) are the options.
