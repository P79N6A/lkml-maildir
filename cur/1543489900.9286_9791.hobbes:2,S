This is a technique that would work on the Alphas as well, but as noted above,
it *does* require driver modifications to manage the resource correctly.
On Alpha, in addition to the direct-map DMA windows which are currently
used, one can define what we call "scatter-gather" DMA windows. The range of
PCI addresses that fall into one of these windows are re-directed to host
memory via a page table, where the address in a PTE can be *any* page in the
possible installed memory - no bounce buffers needed... :-)

Great! Keep us posted with your progress.
