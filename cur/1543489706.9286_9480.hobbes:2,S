As much as I hate to say it, I think this may be good for buisness
people.  The ONLY gripe they can shoot at me at work is that
everything they do is in M$ Office.  I use WordPerfect for the
doc files but still haven't found anything good for exel.  StarOffice
seems to have some problems.  This would shut them up if they atleast
thought I was running it.
