Any changes in your BIOS setup?
What about with vanilla 2.6.23-rc6?  Or vanilla 2.6.23-rc7?
The USB part of the code here hasn't changed in quite a while.  Any 
difference in behavior must be the result of changes in some other part 
of the kernel.  Possibly ACPI.
This might be a good job for git-bisect.
