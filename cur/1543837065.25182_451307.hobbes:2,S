As I said, we do not walk the vmas anymore, no crashes are ever possible.
Just keep a process private list of 'private futexes' , indexed by their 
virtual address. This list can be of course stored in a efficient data 
structure, an AVL or RB tree, or hash table.
The validity of the virtual address is still tested by normal get_user() 
call.. If the memory was freed by a thread, then a normal EFAULT error will 
be reported... eventually.
