Subject: How is SELinux integrated into kernel 2.6?

Sorry if this question is dumb.
SELinux is included in 2.6. But I think it works by putting LSM hooks a lot
of place in Linux and then it can define its own policy enforcement codes.
However, I cannot find hooks in kernel 2.6.9 and 2.6.11. How can
SELinux work with kernel 2.6 to protect system without hooks?
Thanks in advance for your help!
Xin
