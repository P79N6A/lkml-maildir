DB2 is another applicaton that doesn't compile with the current maxsymlinks (5).
We have to patch the kernel on all our linux build and development machines.
It is an unsafe patch (ie: I coded up a sysctl to raise it at run time), and
we have to live with the fact that this could potentially cause kernel
stack to run out if we raise it too high -- not very good, but we don't
really have an option if we want to build on Linux:(
There was some recursion removal that happened a while back which was
apparently supposed to fix this (for some cases), but it doesn't seem
to help for the db2 build structure.
