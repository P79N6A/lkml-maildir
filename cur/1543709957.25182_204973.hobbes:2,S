Not really, I've never done that.

|

A patch to kbuild (the kernel makefile system).
You would need to read Sam's emails about this to see how it works.

| | |
| | | My makefile (dhw, dap, dmgr and dcfg are in the binary parts, present in
| | | the current dir as dhw.o etc.; all the others are .c files that get
| | | compiled during a make):
| | |
| | | ~    ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
| | | ~    obj-m       := nokia_c110.o
| | | ~    module-objs := dllc.o dtools.o dhw.o dap.o dmgr.o dcfg.o
| | |
| | | ~    else
| | | ~    KDIR        := /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
| | | ~    PWD         := $(shell pwd)
| | |
| | | ~    default:
| | | ~        $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) modules
| | | ~    endif

Sorry, I have no idea.
