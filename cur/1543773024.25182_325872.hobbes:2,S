Ummm, in simple terms - this statement is flat out 100% wrong.
LEA with the SIB byte has been around since 386 and is included on every CPU
Linux is capable of running on.
Compile this using -m386 and look at the ASM listing file and convince
yourself.
unsigned int foo(int bar)
{
return ((bar<<3)+bar);
}
GCC is going to generate a MOV of parm to EAX, then a LEA EAX,[EAX+EAX*8]
Don't trust me - compile this and prove it to yourself.
