Sorry no, nobody answered me. What I did realize was that there
was a lot of noise nothing really got resolved.

I reject the vague "complexity" argument. If your application
is not fairly clear on what operations need to happen in a
deterministic time and what aren't, or if you aren't easily able
to get 2 communicating processes working, then I contend that you
shouldn't be writing a realtime application.
What's more, you don't even need to have 2 communicating processes,
you could quite possibly do everything in the realtime kernel if
you are talking some simple control system and driver.
Note that I specifically reject the *vague* complexity argument,
because if you have a *real* one (ie. we need functionality
equivalent to this sequence of system calls executed in a
deterministic time - the nanokernel approach sucks because [...])
then I'm quite willing to accept it.
The fact is, nobody seems to know quite what kind of deterministic
functionality they want (and please, let's not continue the jokes
about X11 and XFS, etc.). Which really surprises me.
I will give *you* a complexity argument. Making the Linux kernel
hard realtime is slightly more complex than writing an app that
consists of 2 communicating processes.

Yeah great. Can we stop with these misleading implications now?
*A* programmer will have to write RT support in *either* scheme.
*THE* programmer (you imply, a consumer of the userspace API)
does not.
There is absolutely no difference for the userspace programmer
in terms of realtime services.

You're controling a robot, and you consider passing configuration
data over a file descriptor to be overly complex? I guess the robot
doesn't do much, then?

You know that if your app executes some code that doesn't require
deterministic completion then it doesn't have to exit from the
RT kernel, right?
Nor does the RT kernel have to provide *only* deterministic services.
Hey, it could implement a block device backed filesystem - that solves
your robot's problem.

Yeah, or turn it into seperate processes that communicate via
shared memory. Oh, wait...

No it is not equivalent at all, and even if it were, that is not
what my stance is. Let's dispense with the metaphors and abstract
comparisons, and cut to what my stance actually is:
"Nobody has even yet *suggested* any *slightly* credible reasons
of why a single kernel might be better than a split-kernel for
hard-RT"
Of all the "reasons" I have been given, most either I (as a naive
idiot, if you will) have been able to shoot holes in, or others
have simply said they're wrong.
I hate to say but I find this almost dishonest considering
assertions like "obviously superior" are being thrown around,
along with such fine explanations as "start writing realtime apps
and you'll find out".
