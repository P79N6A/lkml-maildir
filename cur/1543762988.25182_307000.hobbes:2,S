I'm getting:
  CC [M]  net/sched/cls_u32.o
  net/sched/cls_u32.c: In function `u32_dump':
  net/sched/cls_u32.c:778: error: structure has no member named `action'
  net/sched/cls_u32.c:778: error: structure has no member named `action'
  make[2]: *** [net/sched/cls_u32.o] Error 1
  make[1]: *** [net/sched] Error 2
The patch including the reference to action there is quite recent: 25
March, by hadi@cyberus.ca and signed off by David Miller. There are other
files mangled in similar ways in the same changeset.
