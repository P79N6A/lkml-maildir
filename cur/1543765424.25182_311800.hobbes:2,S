I went to 2.6.12-rc2 instead.  So far it seems to be working.  I was unable
to test this until yesterday due to my workload.
The only problem I have now is the fact that my keyboard has 8 extra keys
which only 3 work under 2.6; all 8 keys work fine under 2.4.
I ran showkey -s to verify.  I see no log messages with 2.6.12-rc2 (I did
with 2.6.10)  They keyboard is an HP wireless KBR0133.  It came as a set
with wireless receiver/mouse/keyboard.
