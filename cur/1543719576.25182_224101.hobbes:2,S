Well, sure.  You could also erase the entire disk and start over.  I
did not literally mean "never"; sorry if that was not obvious.
The point is, if you use the wrong geometry in the partition table,
Windows will not boot.  You could always fix it later, either from
Linux (sfdisk hack) or from the Windows recovery console or with a hex
editor or whatever.  The topic of discussion was how to get it right
to begin with.
