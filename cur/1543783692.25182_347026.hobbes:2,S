Obfuscation isn't really valid security. Making something 'harder' to break 
isn't a solution unless you're making it hard enough that current technology 
can't break it (eg... you always have the brute force option, but good crypto 
intends to make such an option impossible without expending zillions of clock 
cycles). 
Can I ask why you want to hide the database password from root?
