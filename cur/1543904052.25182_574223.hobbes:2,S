Am I right in thinking that the only place it matters is within
pps_event()? In that case, at the very least you should probably remove
the 'volatile' from the definition of the structure, and _cast_ to
volatile where you want it treated that way.
But I don't see why you can't protect it with a spinlock. As long as you
acquire that spinlock _after_ your call to getnstimeofday() what's the
problem?

Sorry, yes. I shouldn't have been looking at that as if it was kernel
code.
I think you still haven't quite got the 32-bit vs. 64-bit compatibility
right. Remember that on i386, the alignment of a uint64_t is only 4
bytes, while on most other architectures it's 8 bytes. On i386, there
will be no padding between the two consecutive 'struct pps_ktime'
members of struct pps_kinfo and struct pps_kparams. But on most
platforms there will be padding to ensure correct alignment.
The simple fix is probably to make the 'nsec' member a 64-bit integer
too. Then it'll be the same for i386 and x86_64 and you won't need a
compatibility syscall routine.
In order for your handling of 'pps_source[source].info' to be safe with
respect to pps_unregister_source(), you have to guarantee that
pps_event() has finished -- and can't be in progress on another CPU --
by the time your client's call to pps_unregister_source() completes. At
first glance I think your existing clients have that right (you have
del_timer_sync() before pps_unregister_source() in ktimer.c, for
example). But you should make sure it's clearly documented for new
clients.
Shouldn't your PPS_CLIENT_LP and PPS_CLIENT_UART options depend on
PARPORT and SERIAL_CORE respectively?
