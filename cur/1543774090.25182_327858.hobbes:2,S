Ok, I'll dig them out and see about getting them setup.
what pinout do I need to connect the printer ports
I'm thinking that the best approach for this would be to setup a static 
logger and host and then one (or more) target machines, then we can setup 
a small website on the host that will allow Ingo (and others) to submit 
kernels for testing, queue those kernels and then run the tests on each 
one in turn (and if it runs out of kernels to test it re-tests the last 
one with a longer run)
how much needs to change in userspace between the various tests? I would 
assume that between the plain, preempt, and RT kernels no userspace 
changes are needed, what about the other options?
given the slow speed of these systems it would seem to make more sense to 
have a full kernel downloaded to them rather then having the local box 
compile it.
does this sound reasonable?

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
