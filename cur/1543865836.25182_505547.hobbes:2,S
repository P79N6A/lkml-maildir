hm. I think this needs more work. For example this part of the fix looks 
quite ugly to me:

so we read the hardware to figure out what the hell we are doing. The 
problem is - why doesnt the kernel know at this point what it is doing? 
It knows the CPU and it should know all the vector numbers. It also has 
an irq number.

the IRR is quite fragile. It's a rarely used hardware field and it has 
erratums attached to it. Again, it seems like this function too tries to 
recover information it /should/ already have.

this looks a bit ugly and a bit fragile. We had a simple 
'move_native_irq()' call for IRQ balancing, which is straightforward, 
but now we've got this complex condition open coded.
If then this should be done in some sort of helper - but even then, the 
whole approach looks a bit erroneous.
To me the cleanest way to migrate an IRQ between two different vectors 
on two different CPUs would be to first mask the IRQ source in the PIC, 
then to do the migration /atomically/ (no intermediary state), and then 
unmask. If the PIC loses edges while masked then that's a problem of the 
irq chip implementation of the PIC: its ->set_affinity() method should 
refuse to migrate edge-triggered IRQs if it can lose edges while 
unmasked!
