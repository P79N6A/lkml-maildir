It works well enough that my laptop made it to initlevel 3.  The code size
wasn't drastically smaller (perhaps another 2-3% but I already compile with
-Os).  The system "felt" snappier, but I have no benchmark numbers to give.  I
could probably get some numbers if anybody cares, but there's a showstopper for
me - I can't make it to initlevel 5 easily:

Quite correct - even after recompiling the sourced portions of the NVidia
driver, it dies a horrid death on 'insmod' when the closed-source portion
passes a parameter on the stack and the open side expects the value in a
register, and follows the register value to a quick death....
Yes, yes, I know, I could re-try with the open-source nv driver instead of the
closed-source NVidia driver - but the open-source one costs me more in
performance (as it's unaccelerated) than the mregparm=3 is likely to get me
back....
