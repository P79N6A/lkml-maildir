If the system freezes on loading a module when ACPI is enabled,
but when booted with acpi=off or pci=noacpi it doesn't freeze,
then it may be an ACPI interrupt configuration issue.
if so, please file a bug with the details.
However, it sounds like you've got some sort of freeze issue (on unload)
even with ACPI disabled -- so chances are good that this is a
device-specific issue.
thanks,
