Thanks, that is much better.  I was just happy to locate git diff in the 133 
git commands on my system; finding options 4, 8 and 22 was beyond my skill.
So, this time for sure!  I haven't figured out how everyone does those neat 
committer: commits* lists, but I'm sure there's an option here somewhere...
Please pull from:
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rusty/linux-2.6-lguest.git
 Rusty Russell - lguest: documentation update
 Rusty Russell - lguest: Add to maintainers file.
 Jeff Garzik - lguest: build fix
 Rusty Russell - lguest: clean up lguest_launcher.h
 Rusty Russell - lguest: remove unused "wake" element from struct lguest
 Rusty Russell - lguest: use defines from x86 headers instead of magic numbers
 Rusty Russell - lguest: example launcher header cleanup.
Without the documentation update (which only changes comments and whitespace), 
the diff looks like this:
 Documentation/lguest/lguest.c   |   23 +++++++++++------------
 MAINTAINERS                     |    7 +++++++

Including the documentation update, it looks scarier:
