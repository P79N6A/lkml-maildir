Hi USB developers!
I have the following problem with 2.6.9-rc4-mm1 which includes bk-usb:
Everytime I sync my palm I get a new device id:
...start sync...
usb 4-2.1: new full speed USB device using address 8
visor 4-2.1:1.0: Handspring Visor / Palm OS converter detected
usb 4-2.1: Handspring Visor / Palm OS converter now attached to ttyUSB2
usb 4-2.1: Handspring Visor / Palm OS converter now attached to ttyUSB3
...
...many usb usb2: string descriptor 0 read error: -113 ...
...
...end of sync...
usb 4-2.1: USB disconnect, address 8
visor 4-2.1:1.0: device disconnected
visor ttyUSB3: visor_write - usb_submit_urb(write bulk) failed with status = -19
...new sync...
usb 4-2.1: new full speed USB device using address 9
visor 4-2.1:1.0: Handspring Visor / Palm OS converter detected
usb 4-2.1: Handspring Visor / Palm OS converter now attached to ttyUSB4
usb 4-2.1: Handspring Visor / Palm OS converter now attached to ttyUSB5
etc etc.
Is this a known problem?
(debian/sid, 2.6.9-rc4-mm1)
Best wishes
Norbert
