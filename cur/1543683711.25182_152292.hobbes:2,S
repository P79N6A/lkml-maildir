Mike,
It's a proprietary board that we use to allow the PC to send blocks of data
to some industrial equipment.  We developed the hardware and Linux driver
in-house.  This same board works (under Linux) on a MoBo using the Intel
815E chipset (Pentium III) with an IHC2 I/O Controller Hub.  This is the
system I did _all_ my stress testing in.  The plan was to ship our product
with these ASUS P4PE MoBos (using Intel 845PE and ICH4 controller) and were
un-pleasantly surprise when it didn't work.
