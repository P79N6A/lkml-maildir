Well I was thinking about things like pre-empt. Also the x86 cmpxchg()
is defined for non i386 processors to allow certain things to use it
(ACPI, DRM etc) which know they won't be on a 386. The implementation in
this case will blow up on a 386 and the __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG remains
false.

It's obviously emulatable on any platform - the question is at what
cost. For x86 it probably isn't a big problem as there are very very few
people who need to build for 386 any more and there is already a big
penalty for such chips.
