Ok, but if we do this, we should also include the (attached) new VIA
driver. I've fixed the remaining issue with MWDMA1, so I hope that this
will work for everybody now.
Andre: is that OK?
A separate issue: 80-pin cable detection on some boards, namely VIA and
AMD pre-UDMA100 chipsets. They use the capacitor-on-board method with
drive based reporting. So the eighty_ninty_three() call should tell us
what cable is in use, right (after checking the ATA spec revision
compliance for both the master and slave drive)?
Currently both the VIA and AMD drivers need an explicit ideX=ata66 LILO
command line option. Andre, if you agree that it's possible to use the
above method for detecting the cable (you know the ATA standard better
than me), I'd like implement it.
