That's partially correct. As most block cipher operate on blocks of 16 bytes
size it perfectly makes sence to use CBC on a 512 byte block.

ECB mode is broken in 2.6.0-test[12]. See 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106043148921893&w=2
It's a quite conservative patch. ECB processing can be optimized.

Thanks :)

Definitly. loop.c is anyway ugly :). It would be nice to rip out the
block-backend stuff of loop.c and recommend to use device mapper instead.
loop.c will benefit from that for sure since it doesn't have to handle two
different case in such a schizophrenic manner.

I like that idea.

I'll give it a try, promised :)
