I have done some benchmarks which show that Linux does not need a tmpfs like
filesystem for performance.  The benchmark numbers were in one of the linux
FAQs at one time, but I dont remember which one.
However, using shmfs for an automatically erased /tmp thats shares swap space
is quite appealing to me (and was what Thomas asked for).  Also, /tmp seems
like a natural place for shared memory files to appear.
