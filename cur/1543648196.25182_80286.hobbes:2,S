There're many ways to have /dev/epoll working in a threaded environment if
you think about it, and no you don't need to have a single thread fetching
events. You can have, if you really like threads, N fetching threads (
working on N private /dev/epoll fds ), feeding M queues, polled by P
service threads. If you like it ...
