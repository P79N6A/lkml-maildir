Please always add a comment when adding such a barrier - it is otherwise
quite impossible for the reader to work out what it is doing in there.
Also, please in future avoid giving your patches subjects such as "ibmveth
bug fixes 4/4".  Remember that the Subject: in your email will be carried
through into kernel bitkeeper and it should be meaningful.
I relabelled these four patches as
	ibmveth: module tag fixes
	ibmveth: race fixes
	ibmveth: hypervisor return value fix
	ibmveth: add memory barrier for hypervisor synchronisation
Thanks.
