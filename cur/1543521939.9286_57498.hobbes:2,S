Note that as I point out in my documentation, and as Alan
also points out, 2.2 is doing fine. The 2.2 code does not
guarantee dma-zone balancing even if it is empty (if there
is enough regular free pages). Which means all dma requests
will fail. I have tried to fix that, since with HIGHMEM, 
the problem is actually more aggravated.
My aim is to fix a couple of problems, move to a zone based
balancing, and then maybe finetune it. For example, the 
>> 7 part can be replaced with >> N, where N is dependent 
on the zone type, or size of lower zones, etc. I mention this
in the doc too. The only problem is, if N < 7, you will probably
have degraded perfomance in certain cases due to more frequent
balancing.

I note that Andrea also commented about this. I am also
of the same opinion as him, we should not (as far as possible)
try to intermingle unrelated issues. In this case though,
I have no idea how having a large number of free dma pages
ensures more higher-order free pages. Can someone give me
the logic for this claim?

Yes, we need to decide whether kswapd needs modification too. Its
just that I want to do incremental fixes, instead of change a 
huge bunch of code all at once. The question is, if I had a Linux
2.3 kernel, where I had completely deleted kswapd(), what problems 
would the kernel face? Ie, what is kswapd()'s purpose?
