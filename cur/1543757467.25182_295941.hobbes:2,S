The only reason kobj_map_init() needed the subsystem argument was for
the semaphore.  Since you're passing that separately now, I would think
that the subsystem argument could simply go away altogether.
Once that's done, you should be able to delete cdev_subsys as well; when
I cleaned that stuff up, I only left it there for kobj_map().
