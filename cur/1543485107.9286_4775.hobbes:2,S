Check out some simple filesystems, such as ROMfs and Minix. They
should give you enough of a hint to start working on your own FS.
Perhaps a look at my "rawfs" filesystem would help. It's a very simple
virtual filesystem that shows all partitions on a disk as big files
(so you can mmap() partitions, useful for software like INN+CNFS).
