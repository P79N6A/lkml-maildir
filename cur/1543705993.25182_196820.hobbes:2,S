    No you definitely still need the test... this is what I mean:
           if (avg_load > this_load)
                    *imbalance = min(max_load - avg_load, avg_load - this_load);
            else
                    *imbalance = 0;
Ah, yes, ok. I thought you were saying it would be zero because of code
elsewhere.  Yup, that'll work.
