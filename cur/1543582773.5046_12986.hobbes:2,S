I'd prefer for this check to be a per-queue one.
Right now a slow device (like a floppy) would artifically throttle a fast
one, if I read the above right. So instead of moving it down the
call-chain, I'd rather remove the check completely as it looks wrong to
me.
Now, if people want throttling, I'd much rather see that done per-queue.
(There's another level of throttling that migth make sense: right now the
swap-out code has this "nr_async_pages" throttling which is very different
from the queue throttling. It might make sense to move that _VM_-level
throttling to writepage too - so that syncing of dirty mmap's will not
cause an overload of pages in flight. This was one of the reasons I
changed the semantics of write-page - so that shared mappings could do
that kind of smoothing too).
