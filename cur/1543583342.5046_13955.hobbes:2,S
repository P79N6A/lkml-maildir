Subject: [PATCH] r128 DRM module -- hardware bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/2/28/65

The following patch addresses a serious problem with older Rage 128
chipsets, up to and including at least the Rage 128 RF chipset found on
the Xpert 2000.  The workaround should be classed as a critical fix, as
without it such cards will lock almost immediately.
