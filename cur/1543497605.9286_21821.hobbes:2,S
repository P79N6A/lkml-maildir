There really needs to be a change in TCP/IP RFQs v.s. local area networks
now that Ethernet is no longer the BW limiting item.
Something like:
(1)	A checksum of zero means don't check the checksum.
(2)	You can't route a zero-checksum IP packet. If you route it,
	you must checksum it before routing.
This would allow LANs to operate at higher speeds where a hardware CRC
makes sure the data is good anyway, while maintaining compatibility
outside the local area. This would also put the total responsibility
for the IP checksum with the routers which are designed for it, or
slow communications links like PPP, ISDN, and T1, that are so slow
the additional overhead is lost in the noise.
I heard that at one time Sun didn't bother to checksum packets that
arrived via Ethernet. I don't know if it's true. Of course without
a rule-change this is problematical because a dirty PPP link could
be routed  to an Ethernet LAN and be accepted even though the data
was corrupt.
