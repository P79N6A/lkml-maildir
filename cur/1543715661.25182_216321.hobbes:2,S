I don't think it's bad to have two drivers for the same hardware. We've
seen that with the USB UHCI host controller, RTL 8139, Intel e100,
Adaptec aic7xxx, NCR/Symbios sym53c8x. Having two drivers makes it easy
for people to switch. The difference with OSS+ALSA is that the drivers
I just mentioned have been "developed" in the tree, while ALSA was
developed outside the tree.

Is AMD 760/762 (amd74xx driver) considered "exotic"? ;-)
