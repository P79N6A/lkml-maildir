I would reference the other recent post on this subject, but it's toast.
This is with Netscapes nsmail Inbox, truncated to Wed 02:44
I made a similar report earlier with 2.3.18ac8.
This time it was going from pre11 to pre12. Clean shutdown, no strange
messages. The problem only happens when I re-boot.
Oops, I just ls's the file. It is all there. Last time it was truncated.
This time Netscape just does not see it all.
