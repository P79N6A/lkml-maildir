Ok. How do you collect all the data in the zero page then?
There's much more in there than just the memory map.
Anyways for EFI the best way is probably to define a EFI entry
point that does the same work as the real mode code today just
using EFI services.
And for kexec :- well need a proper protocol.

Ah i didn't realize this. Ok then kexec is also quite broken.
Somehow this must have been missed this fundamental flaw when this code was 
reviewed.

32bit pointers are not too bad; it needs to be all physical anyways
because kernel virtual mapping can change any time.

It's a minimum start. But at least for EFI I still think it's better
to just move that code back into the kernel. Just cleanly separated.
