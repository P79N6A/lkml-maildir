No, I just started using a config file for kernbench that has every option
under the sun turned on ;-) Makes a longer test, and stabilises results.
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/people/mbligh/config/kernbench2.config
(2.4.17). It's the difference between before and after runs that's going to
be interesting anyway.

make -j is going to spawn as many tasks as possible, creating a massive
forkbomb ... that might be behind the differences - your patch might make
more of a difference for huge amounts of context switching / cache thrash
(not necessarily a bad thing, I just want to find the cause).

How does that compare with and without your patch though?
Would be useful if you can grab a before and after profile, and see exactly
what it is that's getting thrashed that you're fixing (may just be everything).
