I just had a look at 2.2.10's nfs client.  We don't use the fsid value.
In principle to different files could have the same fileid and different
fsids, couldn't they?

I don't think it matters.  Locally the client may think they're two
different files, but updating one will show up in the
other... eventually.

I think the server can give two different handles even for the same
file.  For example the user-space server used on Linux use a mysterious
hash-assist of the path name in the handle -- this presumably means
different handles for different paths, even when they're the same file.
This works ok because the fileid values are the same.
If this isn't good enough, let me know because I'm about to do the same
sort of thing in my own nfs server!
