This sounds about right to me.
Intent is very significant, but then, what vendor would justify the
choice of ROM as "intent to prevent modifications", if this amounted
to copyright infringement?
Vendor would be entitled to the benefit of the doubt as to the
motivations in this case, so it would likely be unenforceable anyway.
