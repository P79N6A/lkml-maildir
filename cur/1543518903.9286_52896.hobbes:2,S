Subject: 2.3.31: make fails when CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y

This problem exists in at least both 2.3.31 and 2.3.30. Compiler is
gcc-2.95.2. The problem seems to be caused by CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y.
When I change to CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=n the problem is gone. Attached
is full .config file.
[hli@lotus] /usr/src/kernel/linux-2.3.31 $ make bzImage
