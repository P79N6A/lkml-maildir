I keep my "clean" tree uncompiled. (I copy it to
linux-<version>.<machine> when I compile it for a specific machine in
my cluster)
I then touch (create 0-length files) the files in the old tree that I
know to be new in the modied tree. I then do 
	ln -sf linux-<version>.<patched>  linux
	diff -ur linux-<version>.clean linux
Note that this creates pathnames into a tree named "linux", just like
Linus distributed his patches. (I still recommend going into the
tree you want to patch and then use patch -p1)
If you want to start building the exclude pattern, I would say that
you should review the patch manually anyway. This weeds out some bad
stuff anyway.
