Subject: [PATCH 4/7] powerpc: Put allocated ELF notes in read-only data segment
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/11/351

This changes the powerpc linker script to use the asm-generic NOTES macro so
that ELF note sections with SHF_ALLOC set are linked into the kernel image
along with other read-only data.  The PT_NOTE also points to their location.
This paves the way for putting useful build-time information into ELF notes
that can be found easily later in a kernel memory dump.
