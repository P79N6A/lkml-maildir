> how to conceal the hostname information--abc? that is the welcome messenge as
 following:
1) This is off-topic for a *kernel* list.
2) This is bogus security - they telnet'ed to the machine, they already *know*
its name/IP address.  You should leave the hostname in so legitimate users can
verify they've gotten to the *right* machine (what, you've never had a server farm
with dozens/hundreds of machines and typed 'telnet foo23' when you meant
'telnet foo24'?)
3) You should be using SSH instead.
4) /usr/sbin/telnetd invokes /bin/login which calls pam.  The hostname gets
printed after telnetd does /etc/issue.  Since I think it's a bad idea, that's
all the hints I'm giving today.  The answer can be found in the telnet, util-linux,
and/or PAM src.rpm's.  If you're going to mess with this, you should learn how
it works, and reading the source is a good way to do that...
