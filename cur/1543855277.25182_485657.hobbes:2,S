  i suspect you already noticed that that's what i proposed in my
followup posting.  :-)  my first suggestion explicitly didn't mess
with the "Device Drivers" menu, only the underlying MPT submenu.
  my second posting went that extra step and added selection boxes to
the Device Drivers menu entries themselves, although your solution is
nicer than mine, surrounding the MPT entries with a single "if FUSION"
rather than my adding a dependency to every selection.
  i'm willing to come up with some patches that match your suggestion,
but what do others think of changing the fundamental layout of the
Device Drivers menu (and perhaps other menus) to that extent by adding
that extra selector?
