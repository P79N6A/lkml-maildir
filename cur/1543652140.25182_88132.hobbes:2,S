I assume you mean, for filesystems that don't support high
resolution.  That is what I think should be done as well.  People
have gotten along with second resolution all these years, so it's no
great tragedy to make them continue; plus, it seems like the common
filesystems will support high resolution soon anyway.
Paul Eggert listed lots of programs that could be broken if
timestamps jump around.  They could all implement heuristic
work-arounds, but that would be 1) a miracle and 2) a waste of
effort.
The only issue (as far as I can tell) is knowing when to round.
Hard-coding a list of filesystems seems reasonable (though even that
could be wrong if I load a newer filesystem module).  Ideally,
though, you would add a simple hook into the filesystem that asks it
to round the timestamp for you.  This would also accommodate
filesystems that don't store seconds or nanoseconds, but some other
resolution.
