Subject: [PATCH] Warn about dangers of LVM/RAID stacking with 4KSTACKS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello Linus
On x86 using software RAID on disks and then putting them together in
LVM as a logical volume uses alot of the stack. I've read reports of
doing this on volumes which are shared via NFS causes stack overruns
which it indeed does, I just reproduced it here.
We should play it safe and warn anyone before using CONFIG_4KSTACKS if
the user intends to do software LVM/RAID stacking until this issue is
resolved.
