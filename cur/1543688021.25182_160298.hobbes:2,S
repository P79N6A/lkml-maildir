Thanks Martin. OK, so the drop in kernbench is quite likely to be what
I thought - elevated priorities (caused by eg. make waiting for children)
causing timeslices to shrink. As long as its not a fundamental problem,
this should be able to be tweaked back.
Yeah, I guess the random kernel and user times are probably due to cache.
