While the suspend request is being processed, the apm
driver attempts to set the power state to "busy", as
required by the APM spec.  The attempt fails, presumably
because of shortcomings in your firmware.
Is there a driver or userland process that is failing
to process the suspend event quickly?
> apm: received normal resume notify
The APM firmware appears to generate this event.
Perhaps it is timing out waiting for the OS to respond
to the suspend event with a set-power-state operation.
How long does it take for this to happen?

A suspended machine does more than cool down.  It does
not operate at all.
