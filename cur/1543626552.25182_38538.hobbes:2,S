the SARD stuff from Alan's tree fixes this (in /proc/partitions though, but
that's ok)
the problem is that /proc/stat only checks major/minor combinations for
majors 0-16 and minors 0-16.  so if you have, say, hdc on major 22 then
it won't show up in /proc/stat.  Basically it's just done wrong :)
SARD fixes this by tracking all the relevant disk info properly, but it's
not in the mainline kernel :(
