Its typically a device you feed a series of fairly low level rendering
commands to sometimes including instructions (eg shaders). DRI provides
an interface that is chip dependant but typically looks like
      [User provided command buffer]
                    |
      [Kernel filtering/DMA interface]
                    |
      [Card command queue processing]
All the higher level graphic work is done in the 3D client itself.
