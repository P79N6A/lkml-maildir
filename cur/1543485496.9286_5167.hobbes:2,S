Just tested on SunOS 5.5.1:
$ mkdir xx
$ cd xx
$ rmdir .
rmdir: directory ".": Can't remove current directory or ..
$ rmdir ../xx
$ ls -a
$ ls ../xx
../xx: No such file or directory
Note that rmdir actually tries rmdir(".") first, and only then translates
the error (EINVAL) to the appropriate message.
