Thanks for pointing out the updated interface in 2.6.12-* kernel.  I
think I can overload the arch specific part of set_pte_at(or for that
matter set_pte, as what I need is only pte_t) to always check if we need
to do lazy I/D coherency for IA-64.....but this incurs extra cost for
making a check every time set_pte_at is called.  This new hook,
lazy_mmu_prot_update, though needs to be used only when the permissions
on a valid PTE is changing. For example, at the time of remap or swap,
this API is not called.

Stuff is there, though the call needs to be made to ensure we are
reacting to it most optimally and correctly.....I guess something
similar to why update_mmu_cache API is still existing in generic part
and not overloading arch specific set_pte_at definition.
