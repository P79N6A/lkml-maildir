Hi Robert,
I don't consider SYS_CAP_NICE to be a typical 'root' thing at all.
Everything realtime needs it as part of normal operations.  I think
of it as an intermediate thing between 'ordinary desktop users' and
'root', and as such it should behave nicely, just like the
plain-vanilla services available to ordinary users.
I believe it is suboptimal to lump everything a normal desktop user
wouldn't normally do as 'root -- let the user beware'.
Joe
