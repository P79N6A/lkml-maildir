Great!

OK. This trick was popular in UNIX. Personally I think it's in a bad
taste, because good applications still need to verify if only one
instance is running, and threfore can use application level locking.
But if you are gunning for the maintenership I'm not going to argue
your style. The busy lock-out certainly works better than "/dev/cua" :-)

The finished flag is only set when URB is not in use anymore. Did you
observe an anomaly with my code? Any hangs? If so, I assure you this
is not the fix. As it's written, even if we ignore the failure (e.g.
do not pass it to userland), we sill have to maintain the correct
flag state.
