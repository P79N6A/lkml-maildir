Not very good scientific practice :-)

I was still looking at the wrong graph this time the dbench instead of 
kernbench :-( (explains why I didn't see the error bars).  Now I see it.
Looking at the other 6 kernbench graphs, I see that it also occurs for 
elm3b70 but no others (including elm3b6 and elm3b67).  Are there any 
differences between the various elm3b systems that could explain this?

It's very hard to understand how it could be an issue on a system that 
doesn't have a lot of abnormally niced (i.e. non zero) tasks that are 
fairly active as it's now mathematically equivalent to the original in 
the absence of such tasks.  Do these two systems have many such tasks 
running?
Would it be possible to get a run with the following patches backed out:
+sched-modified-nice-support-for-smp-load-balancing-fix.patch
+sched-modified-nice-support-for-smp-load-balancing-fix-fix.patch
Thanks
Peter
