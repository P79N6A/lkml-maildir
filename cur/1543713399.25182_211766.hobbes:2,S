did you get an oops or just a sigsegv? (see dmesg) If you only got a
sigsegv can you try to keep the segfaulting process under "strace -o
/tmp/o -p <pid>" and report the last few syscalls before the segfault?
That should reduce the scope of the problem, I had a look at the
diff between rc3 and 2.6.5 final but I found nothing obvious that could
explain your problem (yet).
