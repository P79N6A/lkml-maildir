First of all, thanks to all for the helpful replies.
I have simplified my example, because I was only interested in understanding if there was particular behavior performed by the new scheduler after a sched_yield() call. 
Anyway, I try to explain better my requirements. I have to implement a task which splits its job into two different blocks: the first concerns operations which must be performed within a limited time interval, so a very fast response is required; the second one concerns operations which can be a little delayed without problems. For some other reasons, the two blocks cannot be implemented in two different tasks. Therefore, because of the presence of the real-time block, an high real-time priority must be assigned to the whole task. On the other hand, if it uses the resources for a long time interval, it should sched_yield on behalf of other tasks (of course only after the real-time block operations have been completed).
