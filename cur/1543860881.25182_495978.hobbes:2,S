If the filesystem was designed by someone not from Unix world (FAT, SMB, 
...), then not. And users still want to access these filesystems.
64-bit inode numbers space is not yet implemented on Linux --- the problem 
is that if you return ino >= 2^32, programs compiled without 
-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 will fail with stat() returning -EOVERFLOW --- this 
failure is specified in POSIX, but not very useful.
