I understand this is your device doing DMA (= access) - i.e. your
PCI card is transfering to/from system RAM? This has nothing to do with
any UDMA and it works with any Linux kernel and system hardware which
support PCI.
Are you using some standard PCI bridge by chance? Are you sure it isn't
a hardware (design or manufacturing) problem with the device (bridge)?
How do you check interrupt request state?
