I didn't follow this thread, what's its subject, please ?

even on -rc3, I don't observe this behaviour. I tried from a cold cache, and
mutt took a little less than 3 seconds to open LKML's May folder (35 MB), and
progressed very smoothly. Since it's on my Alpha file server, I can't test
with X. But the I/O bandwidth and scheduler frequency (1024 HZ) may have an
impact.
Cheers,
