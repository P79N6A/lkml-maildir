Hello,
Excellent - thank you! Alexander Viro's and Rogier Wolff's ideas are
also good but having amended your file with three extra entries:
tags
comp.log
cscope.out
I am now quite happy. Of course, as new files created during compilation
are introduced the dontdiff will need amendment but it is the beginning.
Actually, one can automate this whole thing by adding some logic to the
Makefile to have dontdiff file produced automatically?
Thanks,
