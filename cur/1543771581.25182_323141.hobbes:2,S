These are both from the same thread -- I reported the issue.  I was 
having this problem in -mm1, and I'm intermittently having the problem 
in -mm2 ... I'm starting to think there may be another factor involved 
(I can't imagine what) ... But if I am the only person seeing this 
issue, then I wouldn't worry about this.  I'll do more testing when -mm3 
comes out and I'll post as to whether the problem is still present or not.
