Hi,
I haven't treid with an earlier kernel. I am using an Sony Vaio PCG-F8ß07K
notebook and tried to suspend.
What goes wrong is, that the hd gets shut down before anything is written to it.
I see (leaving some details out):
Stopping task:========================|
Freeing memory..done (40502 pages freed)
swsusp: Need to copy 6953 pages
swsusp: critical section/: done (6981 pages copied)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt yadda yadda.. -> IRQ 9
and there it sits. Is it really just the problem, that the hd gets shut down
too early? Is there an easy way to fix this?
Thanks,
Prakash
