Correct.

Yes, this is the point.  avc_has_perm could not fail previously from an
out of memory condition, as the cache nodes were preallocated,
maintained on their own freelist, and reclaimed as needed.

Yes, that would address my concern.  However, I'm still unclear as to
why using RCU mandates that we migrate from preallocated nodes to
dynamic allocation.  I certainly agree that the existing global spinlock
doesn't scale.

Thanks for working on this.  Could you also supply updated performance
data when you have a newer patch?  Thanks.
