Yep.. About 30 seconds per sector is the timeout whereas with 2.6.6 it would never do anything after 
the first timeout. Yes it's slow, yes it could probably be sped up but it is certainly indicative of 
a dodgy disk.
Use something like

 and you might have better 
results.
Jeff, do we really have to wait 30 seconds for a timeout? If the drive hits an unreadble spot I 
would have thought it would come back to us with a read error rather than timing out the command.
I do have a dodgy drive here that I have kept around for testing, so I'll have a look at it when I 
get a tic.
Regards,
Brad
