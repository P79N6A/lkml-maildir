OK.  Probably it would have eventually recovered, because there
would have been *some* I/O queued up somewhere.  Of course, it
would recover a damn sight faster if I hadn't added those
printk's in the page allocator :)

mm.  2.5.6 is stable in my testing.  PIIX4 IDE and aic7xxx SCSI.
So maybe a driver problem, maybe a highmem problem?

I don't really plan to do that.  There's still quite a lot more stuff
needs doing, and it'll end up a huuuuge patch.  Plus a fair bit of
the value isn't there, because 2.4 doesn't have BIOs.
