Hmmm. CVS seems to keep doing strange things to my kernel tree. Whether that's
my fault or not I don't know, but I'm dis-inclined to experiment as a simple
checkin after a patch really clobbers the disk. Rebuilding even a small tree
is pretty horrific. I'm looking seriously at doing something with this PRCS
tarball I've got sitting around.
I know Alan and Andrea use CVS (at least I think they both do), and I think
Dave Miller maintains the vger tree used for the sparc* ports; perhaps they
could be tempted to describe how they have it set up, how they apply patches
(I wrote a quick perl script to spot new / removed files), what branches they
use, etc. Such a description could go in the lkml FAQ, or in
linux/Documentation, or both.
