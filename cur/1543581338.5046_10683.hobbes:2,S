	That's the point...
	In other words, you do a lookup, you start with a primary lookup
and then possibly a second lookup to resolve an MX or CNAME.  It's only
the MX that points to a CNAME that results in yet another lookup.  An
MX pointing to a CNAME is almost (almost, but not quite) as bad as a
CNAME pointing to a CNAME.
