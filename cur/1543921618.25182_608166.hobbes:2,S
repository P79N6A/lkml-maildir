Avi,
it does not hang immediately.  It seems to wait until I go to bed to
hang -- so it's going to be really fun to rebase.  It could be triggered
by something that runs off cron in the guest or host.  I am not sure.  
At this point I know that 2.6.23 and 2.6.24-rc0 hung, and 2.6.22.10
(with kvm-userspace.git) ran overnight.
I will try some of the 23-rc's next.
