I think my email wasn't complete and you risk to take me wrong. I don't
want to suggest you to stop your work. Instead I suggest you to post your
patch.
Actually I seen no patch from you yet, and unfortunately I read your
announce really too late so at this point I think I'll complete my work
unless your patch _completly_ obsoletes my current stuff.
But this in turn simply means that once finished we'll merge the good
stuff from both the two patches to generate a still better patch, so
I can't see any real issue (no panic yet ;).
Apologies if I am not been not clear. Also thanks to who pointed out to me
privately that I am been not clear.
Andrea
