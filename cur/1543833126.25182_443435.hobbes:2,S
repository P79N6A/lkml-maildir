We are not running sendmail. We developed our own mail server in-house. We have
a cluster of these mail servers sending spam traffic to a cluster of SA servers
and we use the round-robin parameter when starting the spamd process and start
the daemon with a ton of min/spare/max children. So we dont see the forking
issue you mention.
