No.

x25 does things like this:
#define SIOCX25GSUBSCRIP        (SIOCPROTOPRIVATE + 0)
#define SIOCX25SSUBSCRIP        (SIOCPROTOPRIVATE + 1)
...
Thus one could use private ioctl behind SIOCDEVPRIVATE and SIOCPROTOPRIVATE as
defined in include/linux/sockios.h. Something under /proc(/sys ?) is 
possible too but I would ask for the policy that applies to /proc before
coding.

net/* for the protocol handler. 
include/linux/if_arp.h
include/linux/if_ether.h
Some place may be updated too:
net/lapb/*
net/x25/*
net/wanrouter
drivers/char/n_hdlc.c
drivers/net/wan/*

Ditto.
