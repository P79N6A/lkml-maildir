Check Rafael's recent message. He's now agreeing with me that for the
purposes of fsck timestamps for the root FS, you don't need kernel
help. You simply run hwclock before you check the root FS. If this
doesn't happen it's a distribution bug. It's not the kernel's problem.
Responding to your other message about timestamps for race conditions:
yes, if you're going to use them, you need sub-microsecond resolution.
If you have a TSC, you may as well use that.
Nevertheless, I'm still not convinced that this is worth the
effort. However, if you feel strongly, write a patch and submit
it. Just make sure it's a config option (most of us don't want to know
which nanosecond a message was generated).
