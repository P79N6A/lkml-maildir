No, when the last buffer is complete.

No clue.  If they follow the spec, then yes.

My theory about get_dma_address at this point is that the upper 3 bits of 
CIV are garbage and are subject to different states each time you read the 
register.  Since I bounded the read by using &31 to mask off the garbage 
bits, that should no longer be an issue.

I don't think so.  See above.

We don't need to.  This is also where the spurious DMA Overrun on write 
errors were coming from.  We *expect* to have a dma overrun on write if the 
last block was not completely filled (notice in i810_write() that we filled 
the remainder of the block with silence).  So, we check if LVI == CIV when 
we appear to have an overrun.  If they are the same, then no overrun, we 
just played the silence until the end of the buffer, then things stopped 
because this was the LVI, and all is good and right in the world.  If they 
aren't the same (which they aren't if you are getting garbage in the upper 3 
bits that is random), then we print out spurious messages.  I think a lot of 
the problems that people have been chasing with the SiS chipset are this 
exact kind of thing.  You'll also notice that support for the NVIDIA nForce 
Audio is now in 0.15.  Based upon the fact that the guy from NVIDIA that 
contacted me had been seeing the same sort of random DMA Overrun on write 
messages, I'm guessing that both the SiS and the NVIDIA audio devices have 
this same garbage in the upper 3 bits of CIV register problem.
