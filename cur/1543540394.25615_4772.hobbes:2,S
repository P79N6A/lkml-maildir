No. Even Linus himself has been saying for years (and recently even
in this thread) that /usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm should
NOT EVER be symlinks to /usr/src/linux
Everything in /usr/include belongs to and depends on glibc, not
the currently running kernel.
And if you want to compile modules and use /usr/include/linux for
the include files, what are you going to do about networking
modules that use include/net ? The one in the kernel source is
very, very different from the one in glibc .. so you have to compile
with -I/path/to/kernel/include _anyway_
You can't just use /usr/src/linux/include, what if you want to compile
against another kernel version? What if you are not root ?
The /lib/modules/version/ stuff is a good idea, but it should
contain a `kernel-config' script that outputs the complete CFLAGS
that the kernel was compiled with. Easy, simple, enduser friendly.
Mike.
