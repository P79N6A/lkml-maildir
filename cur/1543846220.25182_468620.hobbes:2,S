Hello!
Would you accept patches, which
   a) add printing MiB, GiB, ... ADDITIONALy to MB, GB, ..
   b) replace GB with GiB
?
If so, I would check the kernel source for occurences of those
units and replace the calculation.
Imho, it would be nicer to print GiB only, because it's the more
accurate unit (today).
You can have a look at GiB and co. at wikipedia, if you are not familar
with it: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte
Sincerly
Nico
P.S.: Please CC me on reply.
