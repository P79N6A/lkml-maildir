I think it would be hard to do without a way to signal when a waiter
changes priorties. Since other structures could handle it differently.
Another problem is that there needs to be a clear way to know which
structure owns the rt_mutex_waiter . Something in there needs to be 
unique. It can't be assumed anymore that everything is an rt_mutex. 
The lock owner could be put into the rt_mutex_waiter structure. Which
would make the structure bigger, but it's usually stack space. This would
also create some duplicate data since every waiter would need to hold the
owners task_struct pointer.
