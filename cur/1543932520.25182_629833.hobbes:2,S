No, generally 64-bit x86 does not slow down things - it might speed things 
up a bit due to more accessible registers in 64-bit mode. And it does 
change the situation from VM PoV a lot. In (bearded) God's own words - 
"... run a 64bit kernel and then the kernel isn't trying the software equivalent of 
managing a filing cabinet through the keyhole."
You will find this recent thread on same topic useful -

May not be necessary - I recently tried installing Fedora 8 32-bit/PAE on 
a 8Gb Core 2 box and then upgrading just the kernel to 64-bit and it worked 
fine except for the 32-bit iptables service having problems running on 
64-bit kernel. [Also I hear the closed source nVidia binaries will not 
work on this setup - so if you don't need such things you will be able to 
go to a 64-bit kernel w/o reinstalling userspace.]

Like said in the above thread I referred to you might have better luck 
with RHEL/CentOS or other "Enterprise" kernels if you want to stick to 
32-bit. But the pain is not worthwhile - give 64-bit kernel a shot.
