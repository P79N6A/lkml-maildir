The patch helped for me, but there are still problems.  I was able to
run all the way through LTP without it shutting anything down.  When I
used one of the memory tests to chew up all the ram though, I noticed
that VM was killing things it shouldn't have.  First thing to get killed
was cron, then top, then it finally killed mtest01 (the memory test
mentioned before).
