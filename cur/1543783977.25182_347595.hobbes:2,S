Urk, so you imprinted on the clunkiest, most pathetically limited dlm feature 
without even having the excuse you were forced to use it.  Why don't you just 
have a daemon that sends your values over a socket?  That should be all of a 
day's coding.
Anyway, thanks for sticking your head up, and sorry if it sounds aggressive. 
But you nicely supported my claim that most who think they should be using a 
dlm, really shouldn't.
Regards,
Daniel
