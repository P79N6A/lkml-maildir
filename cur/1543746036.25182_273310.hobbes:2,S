Would it be ok to modify i_size from prepare_write?  That would make my
life in NTFS a lot easier...  There are cases in NTFS where I need to do
page updates in prepare write that would benefit from an i_size update
as well rather than having to postpone the i_size update to
commit_write.  (Note commit_write would still update i_size, too, its
just that prepare write would set i_size to be up to the start of the
write because otherwise you have a potential hole between i_size and the
start of the write and at least on NTFS that causes me a lot of
headaches with resident files and non-resident files with
initialized_size != i_size that I could make a lot easier to deal with
by updating i_size in prepare_write to point to the start of the write.)

Slight problem with not running mark_inode_dirty() at this point is that
if commit_write() fails for some reason (-ENOMEM springs to mind)
mark_inode_dirty() may never get run which may cause a problem,
depending on what exactly was done in prepare_write...
