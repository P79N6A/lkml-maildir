My brand new Dell Latitude C640 oopses on boot in 2.5.56 if I
 have CPU_FREQ config'd in. ACPI without CPU_FREQ is okay - well,
 it screws my framebuffer screen (what 2.4.21-pre3 doesn't) when
 the ACPI code does its bootup printk's, but after that the
 screen recovers.
Another thing is that /proc/acpi/fan is empty despite my setting
 of CONFIG_ACPI_FAN=y.
Oh, and one more - /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state claims
charging state: unknown
 as well as
present rate:       0 mA
remaining capacity: 0 mAh
present voltage:    0 mV
 and the info file, when cat'd, prints a few times
dsobject-0188: *** Warning: Buffer created with zero length in AML
Back on topic, if you're interested I can rebuild my 2.5.56 with
 CPU_FREQ and write down the backtrace of the oops.
