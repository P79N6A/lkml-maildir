You could not get 100% compatibility with ANY change (even if you'll just fix
bug this will probably broke someone program! that's why quite a few well-known
bugs in Windows could not be fixed)...

As fast as this does not affect userspace API it's not a problem to me. Source
compatibility is good but binary-compatibility... Even if binary-only modules
was mistakenly allowed bu Linus in first place it's not excuse to make
developers of them happy :-)

Why not ? I'm not know how Hitler could be used here but NT is good sample here:
NT claims to be binary compatible from release to release (or at least from
SP to SP :-) NT developers REALLY struggling to to this and STILL there are
problems. Since most kernel developers are not very interested in binary
compatibility for modules anyway we should expect much more breakage here...
