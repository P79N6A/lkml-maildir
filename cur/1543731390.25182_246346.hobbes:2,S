It's actually:
	2 ^ (31 + PAGE_SHIFT)
'31' because atomic_t is 'signed' and PAGE_SHIFT should
be obvious.
Christoph definitely has a point, this is even more virtual space
than most of the 64-bit platforms even support.  (Sparc64 is
2^43 and I believe ia64 is similar)  and this limit actually
mostly comes from the 3-level page table limits.
