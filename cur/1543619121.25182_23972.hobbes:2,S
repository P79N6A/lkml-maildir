May I suggest a few more cleanups before I apply it, namely try to
abstract out that "&__per_cpu_end-&__per_cpu_start" thing and make it more
readable what is going on in setup_per_cpu_areas() which (quite frankly)
is otherwise a prime candidate for the obfuscated C contest.
Also, wouldn't it be much nicer to just leave CPU#0 at the start of
.data.percpu, and not have to have an offset for CPU0 at all? That would
sure make the UP case cleaner.
