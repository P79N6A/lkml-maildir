As far as i've understood, the problem is that Linux uses a single 
memory descriptor and 32 bits pointeurs. You then have 4Go total 
memory space, and you have to dissociate Physical memory and 
Virtual memory. Programs are using virtual memory.
The more you have physical memory, the less you have virtual 
memory. In order to let programs have 3Go virtual memory, limit of 
physical memory has been set to 1Go.
If you want more memory, you have to review memory managing in 
Linux.
