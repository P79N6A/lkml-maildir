Thanks.

I disagree for three reasons. Firstly, it should be simple to write a
utility that turns on page colouring and then exec()s a new
programme. The new programme will have all of it's anonymous pages
coloured.
Secondly, since the page colouring is done for anonymous pages only
(at the moment), text pages which are read in will not be coloured. So
even if you colour pages for all processes, the programme code won't
be coloured. So the benefit of enabling page colouring for all
processes is that you get to colour (probably) one extra page: the
page used for stack variables while opening /dev/self/mem and calling
the ioctl(). This seems like a pretty marginal improvement to me.
Thirdly, I think we want to keep running without page colouring as the
default while we're still experimenting. Let's not confuse things
further by adding page colouring to all processes. Let's just
selectively add it to important programmes we are benchmarking.

Yes, DaveM outlined such a scheme in some private email we had. That
would be good to try as well. Please send patches. Three algorithms to
choose from on a per process basis :-)
