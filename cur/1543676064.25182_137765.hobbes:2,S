is there a patch for this bug ?
I have the same problem with my laptop, chip sis630, celeron 1.2Ghz, 256MB of
RAM (32MB for video), mouse on PS/2 (ImPS/2) abd read mp3 throught nfs
partition (ethernet 100MB). I haven't try without traffic on nfs but I will
try next time I boot on the 2.5.70 (currently, I'm running a 2.4.20)
