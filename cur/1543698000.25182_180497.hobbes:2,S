MR> I inserted my known working 2940 (7880) into a Sun Ultra 5 (32-bit PCI).
MR> modprobe aic7xxx gave some errors and asked to report the bug.
MR> modprobe sd_mod gave a lot more errors and put the disk offline. The
MR> same hardware (host, HBA and disk) works fine with latest 2.4 kernel
MR> (2.4.23-rc5 currently). The problem is with 2.6.0-test11.
Probably it's not a aic7xxx specific problem at all. I replaced it with
Symbios 53c875 (again with PC ROM, no OpenFirmware ROM) and the results
are the same: 2.4 works OK, 2.6 gets timeouts. NetBSD 1.6.1 and OpenBSD
3.4 also get timeouts with this card. NetBSD also gets timeouts with the
Adaptec card, OpenBSD does not support the Adaptec on sparc64 so it is
not tested.
Something with sparc64 PCI or IRQs??
