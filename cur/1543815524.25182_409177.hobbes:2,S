Note that "sometimes we swap" approach tends to create tons of bugs.
It's much easier to keep track of "this variable is host-endian, this
one is big-endian" and have appropriate conversions where needed.  Trying
to keep track of how many times we need to swap on this, this and that
codepath, OTOH, almost always ends up buggy.
