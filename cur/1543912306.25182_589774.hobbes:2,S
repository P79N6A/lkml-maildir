Given the number of times I've had to use tcpdump and wireshark to wade
through literally gigabyte traces looking for stuff specifically because
the kernel *didn't* printk information it had handy, I'm not too sympathetic.
Especially when the printk in question is currently saying "I know who's
causing the problem but I'm not going to tell you, nyah nyah"....
(And if there's better ways than kernel printing messages, does that mean we
should deprecate the iptables '-j LOG' target while we're at it?)
