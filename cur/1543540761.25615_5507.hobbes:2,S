No, showing otherwise just takes a single example. This counter proof is
still missing.

That is exactly what I want, particularly do I want C++ crap inlined. I
know this bloats my code and eats up my memory, but it's the only way to
get reasonable performance out of some projects that I have; apart from
the fact that -O6 won't have much to inline when your object files are
small.
I certainly would not use -O6 for debugging, and I saw -O6 break code
that -O2 did not break, that would be the reason to debug gcc. If my
kernels (all 2.95.2 compiles) started to misbehave, I'd certainly see
that or get reports from the production machines, alas, there are none.
Instead, random processes (mostly cron) start to misbehave after an
extended amount of time, and that cron has NOT been compiled with gcc
2.95.2.

2.96 is not a release version yet, so I don't care. It's nice however
that somebody is using it to find the bugs and get them squished so I
can have a stable gcc release some time in the future :-)
