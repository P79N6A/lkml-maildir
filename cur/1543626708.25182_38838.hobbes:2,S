I have it on my server, and used it with the
associated patch for kernel 2.2. The problem
is not to spin the disk down, which is handled
in userspace, but to automatically spin it up
upon any access. Thus the patch. I have not
ported it to 2.4 because it wasn't trivial and
I didn't have time for it. But I may one day I
will be bored with my server's noise and I'll
do it. If you want to give it a try, you can
download it from one of my old 2.2 trees :

Cheers,
Willy
