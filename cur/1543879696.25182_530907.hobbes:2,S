Subject: Problem with ufs nextstep in 2.6.18 (debian)

I recently noticed that I can no longer read my 
images of NeXTstep floppies on certain machines.
All are running an up to date etch distribution
but the difference between where I can read or not
read seems to be the linux version. On a 2.6.18
machine:
# mount -t ufs -o ro,ufstype=nextstep,loop nextfloppy-fd0a.ufs /floppy
# ls /floppy
ls: reading directory /floppy: Input/output error
On a 2.6.13 machine it still works fine:
# mount -t ufs -o ro,ufstype=nextstep,loop nextfloppy-fd0a.ufs /floppy
# ls /floppy/
private
# ls /floppy/private
Drivers
Have there been any recent changes that would cause a 
breakage in this area?
