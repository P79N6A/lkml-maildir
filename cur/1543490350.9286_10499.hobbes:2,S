Hi there !
I have tried to compile a new version of x11amp , and the configure
script printed out the following message : 
checking for thread-safe xlibs... no
configure: error: You need to have thread-safe xlibs to use x11amp.
what are these threadsafe xlibs , where can i get them , for what they
are needed ??
can anyone help me ??
I have written a mail to a "normal" linux mailing list , but i got no
answer .
so long !
thanks for your help
nice weekend
