Yes. It is in fact a bug in the user mode NFS server that this is not
supported. Nevertheless, the following patch should fix things.
(Note: We should no longer need to check whether (d_count < 2) before
dropping a dentry due to a change in the filehandle, since the stale
inode code is supposed to know about unhashed dentries.)
Cheers,
