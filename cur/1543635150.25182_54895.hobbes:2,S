With LVM2 waiting in the wings, is it worth doing the substantial
amount of work needed to get it into decent shape ?
As long as the lvm2 folks can get their act together before
the freeze (which seems quite likely if the rumours about the
new lvm code are true), it may be better for those wanting to
hack on LVM to help out on getting LVM2 into a mergable state.
Comments ?
