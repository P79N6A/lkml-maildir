hi,
as of 2.4test2 is get:
B
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686   -c -o traps.o traps.c
{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:1591: Error: no such 386 instruction: `ldmxcsr'
make[1]: *** [traps.o] Error 1
using binutils2.10 does *not* help, i've heard of others who managed
to compile it, using several dists/versions, and without patching
what's the secret?
tony
