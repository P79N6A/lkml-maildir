Note that not all kernels have the 'drop_caches' control file.
So there is not much you can do there.

Well if it helps, you can accelerate the 'problem', by issuing, for example:
(1)
	dd_rescue /dev/sda /dev/null -m $[4*1048576*1024]
for reading 4 GB from disk straight and populating 'buffers'.
(2)
	cat /some/big/big/big/file >/dev/null
for reading X GB from disk and populating 'cache'.
and then you'll see.  Also note that a kernel leak will eventually lead 
to very low buffers/cached values (the ones to the far right) even when 
large amounts of data are read (using either dd_rescue/cat as mentioned 
above), because, of course, the leak clogs up memory.

If you see an Out Of Memory notice in dmesg, you'll know there is a 
leak even if everything was shut down.
