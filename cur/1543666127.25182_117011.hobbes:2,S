We shouldn't be putting this in-kernel, really.  Userspace can obtain
the same results by running madvise(MADV_WILLNEED) against the mapping
immediately after setting it up.  So a simple
	map = mmap(...);
+	if (getenv("MAP_PREFAULT"))
+		madvise(map, len, MADV_WILLNEED);
in glibc is enough.
That will work on 2.4, too.  I haven't tested that though.
