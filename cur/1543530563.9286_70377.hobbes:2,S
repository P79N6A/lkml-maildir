I've noticed that the __FILE__ string created by the occurences of BUG()
and other debugging macros all over the place seem to create duplicate
strings in the kernel image, but if I do a simple userspace test of
printing __FILE__ twice, the compiler/linker combines the duplicate
strings into one.  Does anybody know what's going on here?
[sroot@oof:/d/linux]# strings vmlinux | grep /d/linux/ | wc -l
   2032
[sroot@oof:/d/linux]# strings vmlinux | grep /d/linux/ | sort -u | wc -l
     13
Also, there are a large number of occurences of the printk string from
the BUG() macro:
[sroot@oof:/d/linux]# strings vmlinux | grep 'kernel BUG' | wc -l
    353
Is there some option we're missing somewhere that collapses these
duplicate strings together?
I wrote a patch to change the BUG() macro to call an exported
__print_bug() function so that the printk() string wasn't duplicated, but
I can't figure out how to get the __FILE__ string collapsed easily. 
Also, as it seems to happen in userspace automatically, so perhaps there
is a better way?
