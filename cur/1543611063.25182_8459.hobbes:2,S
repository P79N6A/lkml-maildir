maybe you did, works fine for me as a module, although this driver
doesn't want to compile with gcc 3.0.x (as said in another thread a few
days ago).
did you do the _full_ recompile of the kernel? (cp .config /tmp;make
mrproper;cp /tmp/.config .;make oldconfig dep install modules_install)
or did you just make modules modules_install after changing the config?
