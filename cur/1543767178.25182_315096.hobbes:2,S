This doesn't scale well as more cards are added to the box.
I think I understand why it's good for single cards though.

Aren't the mellanox mem-free cards more or less MMU's as well?
I had that impression after attending Dror Goldberg's talk
though I don't think he asserted that.
Openib.org developers conf (Feb 2005) slideset is here:

Being mostly clueless about Quadrics implementation, I'm probably
missing something that makes Quadrics a MMU but not the IB variants.
Can someone clue me in please?
