Ok. Then I guess we cannot remove discontigmem.

How does sparsemem handle that?

Ok more fodder for preserving the choice.

No no no. For the gazillions time: All of 1-1 mapped kernel memory on 
x86_64 needs a 2 MB page table entry. The virtual memmap uses the same. 
There are *no* additional TLBs used.

You did not read the descriptions. Sigh.
