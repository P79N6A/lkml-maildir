Actually, this is the best reason I've heard for not including
this "prettyfication" functionality at all.  Obviously, we
_do_ want people to be able to collect a complete OOPS.
I suppose perhaps an even more useful tweak to the this
idea would be that if the user holds down a special key
during the start of boot, the whole prettyfication stuff
isn't used and the VT number 1 gets all the boot messages.
