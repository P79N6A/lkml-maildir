How about moving the AT_SYSINFO macro from asm-i386/elf.h to
linux/elf.h?  Several architectures can benefit from it (certainly
pa-risc and ia64) and since glibc also defines it in a
non-platformspecific fashion, there really is no point not doing the
same in the kernel.  I suppose it would be nice if we could renumber
it from 32 to 18, but that would require updating glibc, which is
probably too painful.
