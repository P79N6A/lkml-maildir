Not sure I agree -- it adds one more thing that must be maintained
when reorganizing code.  I think there is a pretty high risk of this
sort of warning silencing hiding a bug introduced later, which would
have triggered an "is used uninitialized" warning.
Perhaps asking for a gcc flag that turns off "may be used" warnings
but leaves "is used" warnings would be useful (or does it already exist?)
