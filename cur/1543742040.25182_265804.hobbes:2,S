Do you have a particular test case in mind? Is it accessible to the rest 
of us? If you send it to me I will run it on my 64MB P2 machine, which 
makes a very good test rig for the oom_killer because it is normally 
plagued by it.
I have already run Rik's patch to great success using my test case of 
compiling umlsim. Without the patch this fails every time at the linking 
the UML kernel stage.
