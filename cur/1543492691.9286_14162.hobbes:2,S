Tested from 2.0.33 . I'm sorry, the "from" machines are production
machines behind a firewall, so the drive to upgrade comes from a
desire for features, not from "a remote DOS attack has been found".
Yes, 2.0.33 takes less than 90 seconds. (wether 2.0.36 is the same,
remains to be seen, but at least we know that we can do a lot better
than what 2.2 seems to do.)
