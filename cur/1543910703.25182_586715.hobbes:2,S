So? As far as accounting is concerned the user doesn't care one bit what
the scheduler decided. The user cares how much cpu was used. If you want
to know how much of the cputime available to the virtual box was used
for a process you just have to add/subtract the steal time. Your have
the complete picture what happened. You cannot get the complete picture
if you have do process accounting based on the TOD clock, you never know
how much cpu was actually spent for a process.

Not really. If I look at a process I want to know how much cpu it used.
Not virtual but real cpu. And we learned this the hard way, trying to do
accounting with numbers that have to get normalized by numbers from the
hypervisor is just plain broken.

The information about accounting numbers that are internal to the guest
is 99.99% useless. You always have to take the external scheduling into
account. We choose to do the accounting in a way that does not require
additional steps to get to useful numbers.
