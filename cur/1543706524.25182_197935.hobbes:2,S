Greetings,
   I noticed two problems that seems to come up after using the 2.6.2 kernel on the production servers.  One is the RPM system. It seems to barf badly due to the db3 vs db4 errors when updating the packages on Redhat 9.0 system.
   Second one is little more weirder.  It is with Horde system which it works all the way, except for sending emails, which it seems to have some problem with it.
   Both works fine under 2.4 kernels, but after switching to 2.6, it seems to have certain problems with it.  Any ideas on this?
