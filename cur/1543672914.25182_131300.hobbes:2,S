Subject: no console found booting 2.5.69

I still find no way to boot a 2.5.6x kernel.
It reports (more or less) : "no console found, specify init= option"
This is the relevant part of my config:
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_HW_CONSOLE=y
# CONFIG_LP_CONSOLE is not set
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
# CONFIG_MDA_CONSOLE is not set
CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE=y
What am I missing?
Another problem is the PCMCIA that I already reported for 2.5.68; it 
stalls if I don't remove the Cardbus card.
