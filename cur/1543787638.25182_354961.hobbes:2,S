[if I don't understand something ameba can understand, I preventively
 apologize and ask to explain.]
1) supported compilers are (effectively?):
	2.95.3 + %z patch, 3.3.*, 3.4.*, 4.0.1+.
2) build breakage on one of supported compilers is supposed to be
   reported and fixed.
3) I can easily install gcc 3.4 with one "emerge" invocation. No problem
   at all. After reading some docs to 4.0.$WHATEVER.
4) arm (other archs?) people mostly use cross-compilers (don't have rmk
   quote handy).
At this point I do not understand fundamental difference of "native
build" from cross build. Consequently I do not understand a problem with
native toolchains being different from cross ones. In my case, it is
still FSF GCC, no stack protection, ... patches.
Even more: you (and, to some extent, me), being a cross-compile farmer,
can't test if
	CONFIG_S390=y
	CONFIG_S390X=n
	CONFIG_CHECK_STACK=n	(made up example, pick another config if
				 you _can_ test)
boots and works fine. All you can do is to test is a config builds OK,
leaving the rest to folks who have the hardware.
Again, if I don't understand something very obvious, please, explain.
