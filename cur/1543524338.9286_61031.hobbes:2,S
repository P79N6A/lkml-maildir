Hi Linus,
     Ok, I did some more testing, and my statement about the above code making
no difference is not correct.  It appears that as long as I have irq 12 manually
assigned to something in the bios, I don't get any lockups if there is no ps/2
mouse connected when gpm attempts to open /dev/psaux.  Here are the results of
my latest testing:
stock 2.2.14:
- locks up no matter what if no mouse connected when /dev/psaux opened
2.2.14 with the above init sequence:
- locks up if irq 12 is not manually assigned to a device in the bios
- if irq 12 is assigned, no lockup occurs.
stock 2.3.41:
- locks up if irq 12 is not manually assigned to a device in the bios
- if irq 12 is assigned, no lockup occurs.
I didn't try 2.3.41 with the above init sequence change, since it seems not to
lockup if irq 12 is assigned.  Here's how I currently have the irq's assigned
in the bios:
            current        old 
PIRQ_0     3              3
PIRQ_1     11             9
PIRQ_2     12             11
PIRQ_3     5              5
It seems to me that this is a bios bug, or at least a bios quirk.
-Harold
