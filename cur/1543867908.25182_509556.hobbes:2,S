That is quite dissapointing to hear when weekely released kevent can
solve that problem already more than year ago - it was designed specially to
support every possible notification types and does support file
descriptor ones, VFS (dropped in current releases to reduce size) and
tons of other including POSIX times, signals, own high-performance AIO
(which was created as a a bit complex state machine over internals of
page population code) and essentially everything one can ever imagine 
with quite a bit of code needed for new type.
I was requested to add waiting for futex through kevent queue - that is
quite simple task, but having complete lack of feedback and ignorance of
the project even from people who asked about its features, it looks like
there is no need for that at all.
