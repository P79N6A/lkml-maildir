Hi,
Linux 2.5.40 oopses on my machine with the following call trace:
analog_decode + 0x21f / 0x370
analog_init_device + 0x2cb / 0x3e0
analog_connect + 0xa6 / 0xd0
gameport_find_dev + 0x45 / 0x50
emu_probe + 0x122 / 0x190
pci_device_probe + 0x5e / 0x70
probe + 0x23 / 0x30
found_match + 0x2d / 0x70
do_driver_attach + 0x5c / 0x60
...
I had to copy these by hand because I don't have a serial console.
More info and .config available on request.
Regards,
-Udo.
