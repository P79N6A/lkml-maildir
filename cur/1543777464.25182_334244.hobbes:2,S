Clocks and counter drift so calling it <prefix>seconds would be
misleading.  It would really only be good for approximate timing.
I think call it something arbitrary and work towards have a separate
mechanism for time of day (which could end up being much more
expensive to use but less frrequently needed).

Using a 64-bit value is a pain on some (many?) 32-bit CPUs.
