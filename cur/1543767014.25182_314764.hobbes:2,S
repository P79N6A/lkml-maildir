I get transfer rates at around 30 kB/s to USB mass storage devices. It
applies to both my keyring and my mp3 player. Both are running vfat.
I'm running 2.6.12-rc3 for amd64 with patches for inotify and skge. The
motherboard is an ASUS K8V-X (VIA K8T800).
It worked alright earlier (2.6.10 or 2.6.11, I'll test later if
necessary.)
Also, if I transfer more than one file at a time the music tracks start
overlapping on my mp3 player.
Any hints?
