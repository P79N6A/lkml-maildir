Eh? This is just suggesting using similar devices as were used in the
anobjrmap patch. I'm not terribly convinced about the remap_file_pages()
extents, since they're only going to be a factor of 8 or so space
reduction.
anobjrmap actually didn't use vma-like devices for anon pages, it merely
chained mm's that could share anon pages (fork()'s between exec()'s)
in a list that could be scanned, tagged anon pages with vaddrs, and
then walks that list of mm's when unmapping or checking referenced bits.
