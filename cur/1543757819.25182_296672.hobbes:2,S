I had started a proof of concept implementation that could reconstruct the 
whole process tree from userspace just from the BSD accounting currently 
in the kernel (+ the conceptual bug-fix that I misnamed "[RFC] "biological 
parent" pid"). This could do the whole job ID thing from userspace.
Unfortunately, I haven't had time to work on it recently.
Also, doing per-job accounting might actually be more lightweight than 
per-process accounting, so I'm not at all opposed to unifying CSA and BSD 
accounting into one mechanism that just writes different file formats.
A complete framework seems like overkill to me, too.
