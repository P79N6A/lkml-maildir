Athlon 1GHz:
kala@nibbler:/tmp/1$ time tar xjf rock.tar.bz2
real    3m19.703s
user    0m9.870s
sys     0m24.840s
According to top, the system was ~90% idle during the extraction.
Linux 2.4.19-rc1-ac3, reiserfs 3.6.

PS. Solaris is over 60% slower than Linux 2.2/2.4 in common fs
operations on my SMP SPARCstation 10.
