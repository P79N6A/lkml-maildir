Hmm, quotaon / with init=/bin/sh seems to work OK, quota accounting is made and
repquota displays normal info.
However with normal startup quotaon / still freezes :-(
Btw, does anyone know why mount is failing for so long time while using with
automount? Process mount is in uninterruptible sleep for more than 10 secs until
reports no disc in cdrom. (the same for my usb camera when autofs try to mount
it while it is not connected).
