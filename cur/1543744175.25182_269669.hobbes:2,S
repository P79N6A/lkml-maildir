I saw similar behaviour in 2.6.8.1 on a non-ACPI enabled kernel with
a dual-port e100.  The nic simply would not work, spewing this error in
syslog:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
If I booted with an ACPI enabled kernel, the box worked again.  IRQ
sharing was involved, though can't recall which IRQ eth1 tried to use.
This was on a brand new Dell Optiplex.
