Subject: [patch 17/18] ub: Comment out unconditional stall clear
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Pete Zaitcev <zaitcev@redhat.com>
This code appears to be more trouble than it's worth, considering that
no normal users reload drivers. So, we comment it for now. It is not
removed outright for the benefit of hackers (that is, myself).
