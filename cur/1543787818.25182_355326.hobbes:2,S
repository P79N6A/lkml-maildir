What's funny is that the first pair is literal and the second
one is syntactic.  Perhaps you may want to do an EBNF ;-)?
SUBJECT ::= "Subject: [PATCH" NUMBER "/" NUMBER "]" [ AREA ":" ] EXPLANATION
Although the current explanation tells careful readers that
"From: " in the body is optional, by mentioning what happens if
it is not found, I think it is clearer if you said it upfront.
Maybe something along the lines of:
    The body of the message should be structured as follows.
    - an optional in-body "From: " line (plus an empty line for
      readability), if the author is different from the e-mail
      patch forwarder/sender; followed by
    - the explanation to be recorded as the commit log message;
      followed by
    - an empty line, and signed-off-by lines; followed by
    - mandatory three-dash '---' line; followed by
    - optional non-diff metainformation -- justification message
      to the maintainer, diffstat etc.
    - actual patch material.
I do not know if Linus wants to advertise this, but in addition
to the in-body "From: ", the e-mail patch application tool from
GIT also understands in-body "Date: ", if the patch forwarder
wants to preserve original authorship datestamp in the commit
the maintainer eventually makes out of your e-mail.  Without it,
the "Date: " of the forwarder's e-mail is used as the authorship
datestamp.
