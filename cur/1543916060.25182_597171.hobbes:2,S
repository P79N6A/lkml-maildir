I'm zooming in. It seems, that the ACPI idle code plays tricks with us.
After debugging the swsusp_suspend() code path I figured out, that we
end up in C2 or deeper power states while we run the suspend code. The
same happens when we come back on resume. It looks like we disable stuff
in the ACPI BIOS, which makes the C2 and deeper power states misbehave.
I hacked the idle loop arch code to use halt() right before we call
device_suspend() and switch back to the acpi idle code right after
device_resume(). This solves the problem as well.
Len, any opinion on this one ?
