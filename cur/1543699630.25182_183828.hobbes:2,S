Did you read the README in udev's package?
Anyway, I don't really recommend using udev for management of your /dev
at this moment in time.  In order to do this we need some more
intregration of udev into the early boot process.  People are working on
this, but it will be a bit of time before it works properly, sorry.
thanks,
