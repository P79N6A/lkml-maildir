Subject: [PATCH ] - 2.5.49 - New serial driver ( Digi Intl. Realport).
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi everyone,
Digi International would like to submit a new serial driver called Realport to the kernel tree.
We currently ship this driver as a source RPM bundle available on our web site.
The driver has been released for about 3 years now and is stable.
The Realport product/drivers have become one of the main products of Digi and
will be very actively supported by us.
A brief description of what the driver is/does:
>         This driver makes the serial ports on a Digi RealPort enabled
>         network product appear as though they are local tty devices  
>         directly attached to the local computer.
I have ported the driver up to 2.5.49,
(The new .49 module stuff was *very* interesting!)
The driver patch is quite large, so I have decided to have the patch put
on our ftp site for download. It can be downloaded from:
ftp://ftp.digi.com/support/techsupport/linux/linux-2.5.49-realport.diff.gz
Please let me know if someone accepts and adds this patch to the kernel,
so I can relay the good news to my powers-that-be.
The changes involved are very minimal to the linux source tree.
In fact, I can list them as follows:
1) Created new file called Documentation/digirealport.txt
2) Updated MAINTAINERS to include this new driver.
4) Updated drivers/char/Kconfig to include this new driver.
5) Updated drivers/char/Makefile to include this new driver.
6) Created new directory in drivers/char called digi_rp.
7) Put our Realport .c and .h files in this new directory.
8) Created a Makefile in this new directory.
9) Updated drivers/char/tty_io.c to include dgrp_init() for monolithic builds of the driver.
I have tested it as both a module (with the new modutils of course!), and as
a monolithic driver without any problems.
Finally, if there are any questions about the driver, source, etc,
please feel free to email me.
Thanks!
