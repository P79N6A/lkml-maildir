It looks like Al likes filesystems more than any other part of kernel
tree...
Existing ring buffer is created in process' memory, so it is swappable
too (which is probably the most significant part of this ring buffer 
version), but in theory kevent file descriptor can be obtained not from
the char device, but from special filesystem (well, it was done in that
way in first releases but then I was asked to remove such
functionality).

There are too many ideas about networking zero-copy both sending and
receiving, and some of them are even implemented on different layers
(starting from special allocator down to splice() with additional
single allocation/copy).
