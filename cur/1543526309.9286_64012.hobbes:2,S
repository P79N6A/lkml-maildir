Alan is absolutely correct.  /proc is an unbounded collection
of unrelated kernel data items.   It has been used as a dumping
ground for everything that in traditional unix has been 
obtained via /dev/kmem (which is worse, esp. on smp systems).
Some of the issues with /proc include localization and 
internationalization issues (i.e. ascii strings) in 
the kernel code (the kernel shouldn't need to be 
localized insofar as possible); bounded buffer lengths
for e.g. /proc/pci, /proc/partitions, etc. 
In the original /proc (SVR4/Solaris) [leaving plan9 aside], 
it was, as the name suggests, a 'process' file system.  It 
was used to provide 'ps' and debugging facilities, primarily
to eliminate the 'ptrace' system call (and extend debugging
ability to multiple light-weight processes - which are the
scheduling entity which underlies pthreads).
In linux, however, /proc doesn't do most of this (it does 
provide support for 'ps', but not for debugging), yet it
provides all kinds of kernel information unrelated to 
processes. 
At the bare minimum, it should probably be split into a
real /proc (perhaps initially providing only ps support, 
but eventually subsuming ptrace) and perhaps a 
/system, or /kernel pseudo-file-system which supports 
the other uses.    Appropriate user level utilities 
should be written (a la ps) to format and display information
provided through the /kernel fs.   The kernel makes binary
information available and the applications format and print
the information.    This would make, e.g. sard and SGI's pcp
products more robust simply because they will no longer be
required to parse ascii text from /proc/partitions, etc.
Eliminating /kernel entirely and using sysdat is another
viable alternative for getting kernel information. Certainly
one which is more efficient (open ain't cheap).

lsmod can certainly use sysdat or /kernel just as easily as 
/proc.

Of course you can use /proc for ps, that is what it was
originally designed for.   
Now, while it is an elegent design, it is an inefficient 
design as well.   While running some very heavy-duty 
database benchmarks (OLTP) on 4-processor linux box
a single 'ps' command can perturb the results significantly.
'top' is even worse.
