A large bouquet of $your_favorite_flower to all those who helped me with my
problems concerning my motherboard's warning buzzer and the lockup problems
with a 100 MHz bus speed.  The former appears to have been my fault - I
reset the BIOS using the "optimal" configuration (yes, I'm cursed with a
WinBIOS) and it went away.  As to the latter, it's starting to look like my
PII Deschutes 400/100 is in fact a remarked PII Deschutes 333/66 (CPUID
reports family-model-stepping of 6-5-0, whereas the S-spec for my processor
indicates it should read 6-5-1, and 80523P_Y_400512 looks suspicious, using
Intel's docs as a guide); I'm calling Intel this morning to verify the
validity thereof.
Once again, thanks!
