   Ok. But why isn't there a "tag" (capabilities?) on the drivers
   which let vconfig barf with a message like "underlying network
   driver or hardware doesn't support VLAN"?
There actually is a flag the driver can set fo this purpose.
Someone should walk over all the drivers that are known to not
work currently with VLAN and for them to set the
NETIF_F_VLAN_CHALLENGED flag.
Another idea, is to do the opposite, set that flag by default and
clear it in drivers that we know it works.
