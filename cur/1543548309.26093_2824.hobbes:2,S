I'll try your patch and look at your documentation.  I agree that the
warnings are bugs.  However, that was not the main point of my patch, it
was a side effect.  The point is that there was code in pas2_card.c to
initialize the Soundblaster emulation in the PAS16.  My patch merely
added the sb.o module to the list of those brought in when
CONFIG_SOUND_PAS was enabled in the configuration.  
I suppose the more basic question is:  Should the Soundblaster-specific
code in pas2_card.c be ripped out and leave only PAS-specific code in
the PAS driver?  Some might argue that would be a "cleaner" way of doing
things.  If the decision of my betters is that initialization should be
left in PAS and the driver as separate (the current situation) then I
believe my patch should stand.
