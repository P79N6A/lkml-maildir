Primarily, that otherwise every module that wants to affect/monitor
behaviour of a group of associated processes has to implement its own
process grouping abstraction.
As an example, the CPU accounting patch that in included in my patch
set as an illustration of a simple resource monitoring module is just
250 lines, almost entirely in one file; if it also had to handle
associating tasks together into groups and presenting a filesystem
interface to the user it would be far larger and would have a much
bigger footprint on the kernel.
From the point of view of the virtual server containers, the advantage
is that you're integrated with a standard filesystem interface for
determining group membership. It does become simpler to combine
virtual servers and resource controllers, although I grant you that
you could juggle that from userspace without the additional kernel
support.
