NAK.
EXT3_HAS_RO_COMPAT_FEATURE returns a boolean value.  It happens to be
implemented internally as 
#define EXT3_HAS_COMPAT_FEATURE(sb,mask)			\
	( EXT3_SB(sb)->s_es->s_feature_compat & cpu_to_le32(mask) )
so the compiler, looking at the preprocessed code, will reasonably
assume it's a genuine little-endian value.  But it's only used as a
boolean, so we shouldn't be requiring the callers to provide an
le32_to_cpu() conversion.
If we want to fix this, let's fix the macros: for example, convert
EXT3_HAS_COMPAT_FEATURE to be
	( le32_to_cpu(EXT3_SB(sb)->s_es->s_feature_compat) & (mask) )
so that we're doing the tests in native CPU endian-ness.
