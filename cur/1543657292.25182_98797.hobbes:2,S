Wil this reach the i2c maintainer or the next auto-generated patch from i2c
2.8.x will undo what you do now and will be sized 4Gb  ?
Will i2c ever get in sync into 2.4 ? Nowadays the main of the patch is a ton
of 'stupid' changes from printk(xxx) to I2C_DEBUG(xxx) or the like.
Will this be accepted if I submit it, even independently of the maintainer ?
Because I suppose (???) that maintainer is sending changes and they are going
to trash...
