"Read raw time"? How can you read the raw time in a fast call if the
fast call needs to do additional function calls (as defined in the
proposed time structure) in the kernel context in order to retrieve time?
A fast call cannot do any function calls in the kernel context or
otherwise.
The overhead of the function calls will reduce the performance of time
access significantly.
