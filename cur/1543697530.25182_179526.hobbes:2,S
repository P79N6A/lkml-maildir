The fixing is simply a matter of linkage ordering and function execution. 
Simple thought experiment
	Merge ide-probe into ide-core
	Export a symbol for the second initializer function if used modular
	Create a mini module that just invokes the exported function on init
You now have the same execution sequence but with the link problem removed.

Its not my fault the 2.6 code is lagging badly, and I wrote the code
because people using laptops, and people using ATA and SATA for business
expect basic functionality like hotplug to work. For most of them 2.6 doesn't
really matter and won't for another 6 months, but 2.4 matters right now.
The cmd640 stuff is the only hard to fix bit, and its unrelated to the
modular IDE stuff.
