For this purpose I (re)submitted a patch originally made by Serge E.
Hallyn that adds a hook in order to catch task lookups, thus, providing
an easy way to handle and determine when a task can lookup'ed.
It's at:
http://pearls.tuxedo-es.org/patches/lsm/lsm-task_lookup-hook.patch
vSecurity currently provides support for it (optional).
SELinux policy can handle in a much more fine-grained these
restrictions, just that it's still something that not all people can
deploy without some special effort and "tweak up" (if their system
doesn't provide support for it, of course, currently Red Hat has done a
great job in that terms).

I completely agree.
