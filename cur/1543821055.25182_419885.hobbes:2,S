Hi Woody and the others,
Is there anything else we could try to make this damn hpt366 work to
somewhat better extent? now 700kBps is too slow -- I just gave up
waiting while it would rebuild RAID1 on those two drives. and that also
slowed down another RAID present in the system (nice Areca one)

Isn't what it the libata implementation which oopsed? May be I should
try older "Support for SATA", but kernel menu item says that it
conflicts with libata SATA driver, so I am not sure how stable that
solution will be either... but I know that on 2.6.7 there were no
problem detecting the beast
I am not much of a kernel hacker that is why my question is so vague...
but many be I can be of some help if pointed to the right direction
Thank you in advance
