Because quite often I know what the problem is after having asked the reporter
a couple of simple questions or I can forward his report to a list on which
there are the right people and the problem gets fixed quickly, so it just
doesn't need to be formally registered.
The problem with the bugzilla is that it requires a considerable setup for each
bug which is a loss of time if the bug is trivial.  Using the bugzilla for
handling trivial bugs just doesn't make sense, IMHO.  It's too heavywieght
for that.  [It _is_ useful nevertheless.  For example, the suspend metabug that
you've created for me is really a nice thing, so thanks a lot again. :-)
Perhaps something like this might be used for tracking the regressions ...]
Unfortunately, you can't say whether or not the bug is trivial until you see
the report.  If you've got it from bugzilla, you're stuck with it, so it's just
more efficient to use something else in the initial phase of resolving
problems.
