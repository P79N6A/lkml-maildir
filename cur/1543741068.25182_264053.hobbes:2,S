Subject: [PATCH] DECnet connect hang bugfix

This patch fixes a bug in the DECnet connect that seems to have been in 2.6 for
a while now.
If a connection is rejected by a remote host (eg invalid access control, no
such object etc) the Linux end hangs in connect() because it is only waiting for
the socket to go into RUN state.
This patch sets the ECONNREFUSED error state on the socket when the connection
is rejected to that the connect() exits it's wait loop and returns the error to
the user.
