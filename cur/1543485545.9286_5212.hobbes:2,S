Andi's point about "don't do that if it hurts" is well taken, but Lantz
(the original poster) has no bulk transfer option, and doesn't want to wait
the extra 20 ms per transfer for no good reason.  I've modified the patch
so that at least the optimization doesn't hurt us for small transfers as
it does now.
In a stock 2.2.1 kernel, the receiving end of the 723-byte transfer
is in quickack mode, and has ato = 1 when the data comes in.  Then
tcp_remember_ack() tries to "help" us by noticing the PSH flag and
the small transfer size, so it kills quickack and sets ato = 2.
Questionable.
I try to curb that behavior while still allowing the original optimization
intended by the routine, in the following patch.

This is a bit more complex, but only affects the one little corner case
of single (web-like) transfers in the range 1--723 bytes (on ether), where
ato is still smaller than HZ/50.  For reference, here's my earlier
suggestion which DaveM conceptually approved, and I still favor for its
simplicity.

Dave, I'd like to see the latter patch in the kernel.  Both attempt to
preserve quickack mode, but the former patch does extra work to ensure
it only does so if ato is already quite small (< 20 ms).  Both will return
with ato <= HZ/50, but the former works hard not to raise the ato.
Intuitively I don't see the case happening, so think the latter is sufficient.
