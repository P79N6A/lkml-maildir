Correct.

I dunno what the purpose of that would be exactly, I guess to cater to
some hardware odditites?

Doesn't make a lot of sense in this case I think, because the command
associated with the SG_IO request would implicitly be either a 28-bit or
48-bit command based on the opcode of the request.

You haven't really convinced me yet. Is there some hardware out there
that requires to be addressed in 48-bit mode? If that is the case, then
yes a bit is missing to fully support that. We'd probably have a forced
addressing flag in the hwif, and the drive->addressing would inherit
that. So instead of
	const int lba48 = rq_lba48(rq);
it would be
	const int lba48 = rq_lba48(rq) || drive->addressing == FORCED_48;
(forgive the ugliness of the above construct, it's just meant to below
operation of it, rq_lba48 would probably just take both drive and rq as
parameter).
