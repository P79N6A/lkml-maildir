We can keep it simple, as long as we keep it flexible.

Templates would help out here.  Right now, if something isn't a config
option, you have to dig into the source to tune things.  This isn't
really nice since to tweak most things you only need to change a few
constants.  The problem is finding all of these constants, and the
places where maybe someone used a number derrived from the constant, and
so on..

I would hope it was, but it doesn't seem like that's been what's going
on..

Building a 'tiny' kernel should have nothing to do with any of this.
Don't think 'tiny' think 'flexible'.  And I'm not necessarily saying it
has to be N CONFIG options (Matt Porter's template idea is rather
tempting), just that things have to be:
a) Flexible enough such that someone who wants to tweak param X doesn't
have to know every intricate detail of subsystem Y just to tune things.
b) Done in a way that doesn't clutter up the code in question (ideally
s/some_constant/SOME_DEFINE).
c) Be simple enough such that people don't shoot their feet off, at
least not unintentionally.

By that token, if it's not worth it's own CONFIG, don't mask it under 1
CONFIG either.  That doesn't make it easier to tune one param if you
have to check N occurances of CONFIG_TINY to make sure you got all of
the correct places.
