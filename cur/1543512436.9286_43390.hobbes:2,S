The overhead should be low, we could keep the "double synchronization",
ie
* either down(&mm->mmap_sem) or spin_lock(&mm->vma_list_lock) for read
* both locks for write.
I think that 3 to 5 spin_lock() calls are required.

That would be a good idea:
For multi-threaded applications, swap-in is currently single-threaded,
ie we do not overlap the io operations if 2 threads of the same process
cause page faults. Everything is fully serialized.
But I think this would be a huge change, eg do_munmap() in one thread
while another thread waits for page-in....
