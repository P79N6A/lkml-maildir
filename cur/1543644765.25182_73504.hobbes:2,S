	Hello Justin ,
	What is the latest version # of the aic7xxx driver ?
	Where is the latest version of the aic7xxx driver ?
	I've been to:
		
http://people.freebsd.org/~gibbs/linux/
	and it shows 6.2.5 .  My kernel 2.4.19 says 6.2.6 .
	An email from you to the list mentions you rolling a 6.2.7 quite
	sometime ago .  Help !-} .  Tia ,  JimL
