Why would anyone design a system like that ?!
The logging of every security system is prone to flooding.  You may have
noticed that your syslog sometimes spits "Last message repeated N times"
so it won't repeat itself.  A system that doesn't deal with this issue in
any way can't be secure.  There are a lot of methods to deal with it but I
think we're going seriously off-topic here so if anyone wishes to continue
discussing this specific logging problem, I suggest we switch to non-lkml
mode.

Not necessarily - it depends on the case.  If the file being unlinked is
the logfile itself, and its checked by an cron job every once in a while
(a common situation), an attacker won't mind making a lot of noise into
the soon-to-be-a-free-inode logfile.  After-the-fact security systems are
usually not suitable for server protection, and the system you suggest,
being statistical, is after-the-fact by definition.
