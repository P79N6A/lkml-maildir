I know no one really wants to hear this, but I get the exact same
message on my Athlon800/Thunderbird system. It doesn't do this with
-test6, but it has other problems then (like failed dependencies all
over the place) so I'm not using that either. I'm not a kernel hacker
myself so I can't really assist in fixing it. Just wanted to say you are
not alone and maybe neither of us made a mistake.
