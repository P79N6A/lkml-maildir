Actually, ***FOR THE P6*** Intel says to do it before turning on the L2
cache, which means it *HAS* to be done by the BIOS.  Consequently, this
is in EITHER WAY an inappropriate thing to do in user software.
However, the point is that (a) the P6 isn't the world, and (b) not all
BIOSes do things right.
