For i386 you are right: the implementation of pci_dma_sync_single and 
pci_dma_sync_to_device_single happen to be identical. This is because this 
arch is cache-coherent so all we have to do to achieve consistency is 
flushing the buffers. However, for other arch's there might be significant 
dependency on the direction.
The existing pci_dma_sync_single was meant for the FROM_DEVICE direction 
only. I agree it's not entirely obvious currently. But making it 
BIDIRECTIONAL would be pretty expensive on some none cache-coherent archs 
and the whole point of having separate streaming mappings with dedicated 
TO or FROM direction would be void.

For an rx_ring I tend to say this should be FROM_DEVICE but would work 
anyway, probably with some unneded overhead when syncing.

IMHO that's an bug. It happens to work on i386, but currently there's no 
dma-api call to resync the outgoing streaming maps. So if the drivers 
has modified rx_ring_dma and wants to sync so the device will see the 
changes consistently, this might fail on other archs.
And I'm wondering why this driver syncs the rx_ring with direction 
TODDEVICE in the first place - the direction-parameter indicates the 
direction of the dma transfer, not the act of giving buffer ownership to 
the hardware. Is this hardware reading from the rx_ring buffer? Sorry if I 
missunderstood what the rx_ring_dma[] is in this case - if this are just 
the ring descriptors (in contrast to the actual buffers) I believe the 
whole mapping should just be consistent, not streaming.

That's why my patch updates Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt ;-)
