Well, it's harder no matter when we do it, right?  Whether we do it
before we submit or after, we still before us have the choice of
whether to let the filesystems diverge (and make it harder to do
maintenance), or not.  But Linus and others have spoken pretty clearly
that they don't want ext3 to be touched, and it's not even clear that
people would be happy with cleanups.
If we are going to do the cleanups in both, it would actually be
better to fix up ext3 *first*, and then do the copy...
