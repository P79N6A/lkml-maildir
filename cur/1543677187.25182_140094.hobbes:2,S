grumble, mutter.  It's certainly simple enough.
+	mapping = vma->vm_file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_mapping;
I'm not so sure about this one now.  write() alters dentry->d_inode but
truncate alters dentry->d_inode->i_mapping->host.  Unless truncate is
changed we have the wrong mapping here.
I'll put it back to the original while I try to work out why truncate isn't
wrong...
