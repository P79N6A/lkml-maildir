We've arrived at another coding policy :)
There are two possible behaviors, each have pros and cons. HPA prefers one,
while Jan and me would prefer the other. The difference is one function that
contains a large table and an invocation of that function in a small if
branch.
In my latest version of the patch I've put the function itself inside
comments too. So it's not the real compiler, it's the preprocessor that
omits this code for the default behavior. HPA, I hope you don't mind if the
other reasonable behavior is there in the source, within comments. I think
let's make the job easier for those who have a different opinion. Or is it a
completely stupid idea?
