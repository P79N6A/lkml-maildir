Sure, but it's not registering, but telling the subsystem, we use the device, so
that user can't hotunplug it since some driver uses it and reads and writes its
registers. It's purpose of refcounting in pci_dev_{put,get}() (pci_dev_get is
called in pci_get_device()).

This patch is against 2.6.18-rc1-mm2. (Maybe you mean there are some patches
coming to -rc2-mm1?)
