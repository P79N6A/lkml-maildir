Please find the new version below. Re-diff + update the comments.
----------
[PATCH 3/4] ptrace: reintroduce __ptrace_detach() as a callee of ptrace_exit()
No functional changes, preparation for the next patch.
Move the "should we release this child" logic into the separate handler,
__ptrace_detach().
