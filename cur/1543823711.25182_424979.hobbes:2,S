How exactly does the userspace benefit from the
INPUT_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_BUS thing?
And, by the way, why doesn't the input have the
capability of disabling/enabling the device?

The only possibility to do this, was to have the grabbing
capability *in input layer*, which you already rejected too.
With this, it was possible to have such a behaviour run-time
configurable, but now my best bet would be to resort to the
Kconfig games, making a note for users that the uinput is now
an only possibility to route the terminal beeps to the snd-pcsp.
