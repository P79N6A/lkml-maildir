Does anyone have any strong opinions about this patch?  The idea is to
have something like bpck demand-loaded (if kmod is configured) when pcd
tries to initialises.
The current situation requires pre/post-install rules if you want to use
modules, and (for reasons outlined before on this list) that's not really
much good.
Tim.
