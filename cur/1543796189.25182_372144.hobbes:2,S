Could be.  But what about the bug which I think is there?  That'll cause
overscanning of the DMA zone.

Nope.  See how shrink_zone() bases nr_active and nr_inactive on
zone->nr_active and zone_nr_inactive.  These calculations are intended to
cause the number of scanned pages in each zone to be
	(zone->nr-active + zone->nr_inactive) >> sc->priority.

kswapd should only block under rare circumstances - huge amounts of dirty
pages coming off the tail of the LRU.
