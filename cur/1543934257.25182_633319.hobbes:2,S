As pointed out by Jesper Juhl, my patch was not inlined :-(
I did set up mutt especially to send this patch (instead
of thunderbird), and I did test it before sending (and it 
applied correctly).
However I did not notice that it was not inlined because
mutt automatically displays attachments inline. 
Do you want me to send it again (inlined) and with the
Reviewed-by: line?
Thanks in advance,
Carlos
PS: The version I sent to lkml was a new version,
containing also the two-empty-lines -> one-empty-line 
cleanup suggested by you.
