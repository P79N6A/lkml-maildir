No, I don't use any initrd at all.
You should just get a message saying that the version magic doesn't
match, so the initrd modules will not load.  That's what happens to me
when I try to force old modules to load.

Ah taking the "g" off the search works, didn't realize that.
And I didn't have any unchecked in files, 'git status' shows no modified
files, but other stuff in the main directory, like patches that
shouldn't matter, but perhaps they do.
But oh well, I'm still building your tree now to try to reproduce
this...
