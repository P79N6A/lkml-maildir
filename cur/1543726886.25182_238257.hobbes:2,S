Could you try on 2.6.8-rc2-mm2 along with this patch?  Vatsa had a patch
go in that should prevent the crash you are seeing -- the patch below is
needed to prevent the same crash in the offline case.  This check used
to be in load_balance and some other scheduler functions, iirc; does
anyone know why they were removed?
