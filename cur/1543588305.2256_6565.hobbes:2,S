Well, I tried that, and it doesn't work. The problem is that the child
starts ptraced, but it is its parent that will receive a signal for each
syscall, and not the program that ptraces its parent. Of course, the
parent will probably be a little bit confused by that (as it doesn't expect
to receive those signals) and the monitoring programm won't see anything.
Maybe it would work if the function copy_flags in fork.c was modified
into:

(sorry, it is a 2.2.19pre8 kernel, and I don't know what have changed
since in that file)
Ok, I haven't tried it (can't reboot a machine now), and I don't know
what I am talking about, but the idea is simply ``if CLONE_PTRACE is set,
and the parent is ptraced, then the child's effective parent should be
its grandfather.''
Was it the way it was intended to work ? As it is now, I don't see any
use of the CLONE_PTRACE flag.
