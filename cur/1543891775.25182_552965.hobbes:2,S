The original suggestion was to count them and only complain if there
were "lots".  I had thought though that the general consensus was that
#ifdef in C files was pretty much frowned upon.  I must admit to working
to the "you must be able to justify all winges in the output" rather
than expecting the result to be empty necessarily.
I am ambivalent on what gets reported as long as its generally useful.
I as you say don't want to produce so much noise that it hides the
useful output.
We've not talked about how the tool might grow.  My thought was that
soon we would enable the robot replies on linux-mm (say) and use the
feedback from that to tune what we do and do not report.  I have been
pushing all of the contributions to -mm for sometime through it and
cirtainly the #ifdef one once of the more common ones (other than white
space dammage and >80 character lines).
