Subject: [PATCH] lguest: fix TSC "divide error: 0000 [#1]" boot crash
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/28/346

Configuring a guest with < CONFIG_M586TSC reveals an lguest bug: the
TSC code expects to see the TSC capability bit, but we weren't setting
up the capabilities until much later in check_bugs ->
identify_boot_cpu -> identify_boot_cpu.
Do the same thing as Xen and the head.S native code: populate the
first capability word before start_kernel().
