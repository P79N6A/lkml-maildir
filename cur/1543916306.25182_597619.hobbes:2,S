Yes. I completely agree. This is required for data consistency.
But in my testing, if one of the NFS server/mount goes offline for
some point of time, the entire system slows down, especially IO.
In my test program, I forked off 50 threads to do 4K writes on 50
different files in a NFS mounted directory.
Now, I have turned off the NFS server and started another dd process
on local disk ("dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/x count=1000") and this dd
process progresses.
I see I/O wait of 100% in vmstat.

I have about 4Gig of RAM in the system and most of the memory is free.
I see only about 550MB in buffers, rest all is pretty much available.

Here is the stack trace for one of my test program threads and dd
process, both of them are stuck in congestion_wait.

-----------------------------------
Can this be worked around, since most of the RAM is available, dd
process could infact find more memory for it's buffers rather than
waiting due to NFS requests. I believe this could be one reason why
file systems like VxFS use their own buffer cache different from
system-wide buffer cache.
Thanks
