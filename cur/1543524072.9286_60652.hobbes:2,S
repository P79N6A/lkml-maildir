Nice patch. But why only file_operations? There are some/many
other struct-initializers that need the same optimization.
The only places, where we _shouln't_ do this, are places not
embedded in "#ifdef __KERNEL_"/"#endif /* __KERNEL__ */"
protections, because this _can_ be used from user code, which is
not required to use gcc (but kernel compilation is!).
This feature is not ANSI-C, so it is gcc specific.
Would you accept additional/incremental patches, to make this a
"better_struct_initializer"-patch?

Ingo Oeser
