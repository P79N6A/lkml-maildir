No, I did check my /tmp, I can assure you. Well, no, I did _not_ but I do
not have a separate /tmp. I like huge root filesystems (until recently,
when I realized that I most often corrupt/work in /usr/src so it's now
separate and there are multiple roots for disaster recovery) so checking
that root was OK implied /tmp was OK.
Also, running out of space in /tmp can hardly cause a bunch of ext2
messages about freeing blocks not in datazone etc.

PS. I do have another filesystem which is separate from root, i.e. /boot,
again shared amongst all roots but I doubt ld(1) is storing anything in
/boot :)
