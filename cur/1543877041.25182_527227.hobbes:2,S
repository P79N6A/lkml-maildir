In any given system, yes there are bugs lurking.  But I was more concerned
with a provably wrong assumption made by the current framework.  Such things
cause cascading fragility.
As Thomas mentioned, HPET isn't the only place where a "linear" model fails.

I wouldn't.  Much better to have a solid handle on the interdependencies
than to need to cope, long term, with a framework that doesn't allow that.
Remember also that a LIFO model assumes that there's only one sequence by
which the hardware powers up/down ... i.e. that there's no runtime PM going
on, whereby large chunks are regularly powered down/up based on usage.
Better runtime PM becomes more important as system complexity rises.
