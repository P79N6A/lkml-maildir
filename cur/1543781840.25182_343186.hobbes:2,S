Hi Ingo, Paul, others,
I'm trying to run a user-mode-linux guest under the RT kernel however
the uml process never gets out of the calibrate delay loop. It seems as
if the signal never gets through.
A non -rt host kernel does work (with a similar .config).
Could this be related to pauls task list changes?
Kind regards,
