We do have known issues in XFS on 2.6 with handling certain VM
allocation failures -- maybe hitting that here.  Christoph has
been looking at making XFS do a better job there; __GFP_NOFAIL
allocations failing seem to be the worst issue for us - on the
occasions I've hit that though, its always immediately fatal.
