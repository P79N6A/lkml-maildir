Umm..
Ehh.. So now you have two cases:
 - you hit in the cache, in which case you've done an extra allocation,
   and will have to do an extra memcpy.
 - you don't hit in the cache, in which case you did IO that was
   completely useless and just made the system slower.
Considering that the extra allocation and memcpy is likely to seriously
degrade performance on any high-end hardware if it happens any noticeable
percentage of the time, I don't see how your suggest can _ever_ be a win.
The only time you avoid the memcpy is when you wasted the IO completely.
So please explain to me how you think this is all a good idea? Or explain
why you think the memcpy is not going to be noticeable in disk throughput
for normal loads?
