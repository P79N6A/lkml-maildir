I believe in that same post, I pointed out that throughout the prep
period, all members *did* have a valuable contribution.  Don't use half
the info to make a point, please.
And for paper & proposal reviews, also having been on the OLS program
committee for several years, I can guarantee you that these are two different
birds.  Paper proposals are more static, have a more or less intrinsic
value that you can assess at a single reading.  KS is *much* more dynamic,
and would be just another conference if it weren't.  KS is about current
issues, and actions to address those issues.  The *actions* part is a lot
harder than the paper reading portion.  Don't confused KS with a conference;
it is a workshop for a very, very large, very very active project.
