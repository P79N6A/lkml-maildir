Greetings all,
   Just downloaded 2.2.0-pre1 off of tsx-11.  Configured and compiled 
just fine.  Went to reboot and poof, it looked like it oopsed.  (running
matroxfb and when it went into graphics mode there was nothing, kinda like
the oopses in 2.1.78 or so when the fb stuff was new to IA32)
   Now it actually boots, but not much farther.  I see the NE2000 (ISA) driver
appear to load (flash of message that I can read) and then it reboots.
   I see no error, or oops printout, it just reboots.  This machine has been 
pretty darn stable for all of the 2.1.1xx series, so this one bugs me.
   One other darn peculiar thing that I noticed is that the kernel saw 2
processors, initialized them, but when the framebuffer started, there was only
one penguin rather than 2.
   Anything I can test or try is welcome, I'm just as happy to see 2.2.0 
finalized as everyone else...
Mark
