Well, I'm not sure that just because a CPU has two hyperthread units in
the same core that those HT units have a different distance or latency
to memory...?  The fact that it is a HT unit and not a physical core has
implications to the scheduler, but I thought that the 2 siblings looked
identical to userspace, no?  If 2 CPUs in the same node are on the same
bus, then in all likelihood they have the same "distance".

That's the real issue.  We need to agree upon a meaningful definition of
CPU-to-CPU "distance".  As Jesse mentioned in a follow-up, we can all
agree on what Node-to-Node "distance" means, but there doesn't appear to
be much consensus on what CPU "distance" means.
