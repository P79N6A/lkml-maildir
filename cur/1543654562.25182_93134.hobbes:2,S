Patch looks basically ok, but you should get together with Dave Jones 
and come up with a unified patch that also eliminates the 
private=kmalloc allocation by filling in init_etherdev's 2nd argument.
Both init_etherdev and alloc_etherdev allocate struct net_device* and 
dev->priv in a single allocation.  As an additional bonus, dev->priv is 
aligned on a 32-byte [not bit] boundary, and the entire area is zeroed 
with memset()
