Also, please note the word "Callstack" in the error reports doesn't really
mean an actual call here. It means "functions are linked together if they
are assigned to the same structure field".
for example, the following error report is catched in this way:
net/core/pktgen.c:proc_write treats its second arguemtn as tainted.
we take it as a good code example, and require that all the other
functions that are assigned to proc_dir_entry.write_proc must treat its
second argument as tainted.
sorry for the confusions.
