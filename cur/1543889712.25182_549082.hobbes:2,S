Thanks!

Sure ..I will work on a -v14 port. I would like to target for something which:
1. doesn't break performance/functionality of existing CFS scheduler
  -if- CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHEDULER is disabled. This also means load
  balance should work as it works today when the config option is
  disabled.
  Do you recommend a set of tests that I need to run to ensure there
  is no regression? I know that there is a bunch of scheduler
  tests floating around on lkml ..Just need to dig to them (or if
  someone has all these tests handy on a website, I will download from
  that site!)
2. Provides fairness at group (user) level at the cost of missing load
   balance functionaility (missing until I get around to work on it that
   is).

sure i will try that on my next version.
