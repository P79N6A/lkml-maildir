No, I have to collapse the if and assign lines in order to take
advantage of the compiler when CONFIG_SERIAL=n.  Then anything within
the if {} will just be compiled away if the return value of a static
inline function is 0.
As for using a macro, that doesn't really have any advantages over the
existing different functions.
