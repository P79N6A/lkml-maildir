Hi all.
I'm wondering if anyone has tried using Aegis for storing their kernel
repositories? I've begun to look at it because I'm wanting to maintain
Software Suspend patches for current and historic versions of the 2.4
and 2.6 trees, and it looks like it might be the best tool for the job.
Regards,
Nigel
