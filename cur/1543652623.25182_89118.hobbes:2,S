	RAID0 can work fine.  You cannot have a persistent superblock
and autostart, because then the two nodes stomp on each other.  To allow
anything other than this, you'd need cluster services and node locking.
	How to do RAID0?  Have each node mkraid the RAID0 (or mdadm
equiv) at boot.  Because there is no persistent superblock, there is no
contention to the disk.  OpenGFS or OCFS can now share the nice striped
volume, because they handle the locking for their data.
	We have, in fact, run OCFS on shared RAID0 in this fashion.
