Hi Andi.  Please can you explain the behaviour I get?  I have a modem
which will connect for about 2 minutes at a time.  Reconnecting takes
about 2 minutes also -- the callback PPP negotiation sequence is not
fast.
I connect and establish an ssh connection (which uses keepalives).  All
goes well until the modem loses the connection.  It always does this
just when I've typed something and the response hasn't come back.  The
modem is back 2 minutes later.  Of course, there is no hope of the
session continuing -- the retransmits are too far apart.
If they are clamped at 120s, should I expect to be able to continue a
session about half the time?  I find about 1 in 30 sessions will
continue.
Thanks,
-- Jamie
