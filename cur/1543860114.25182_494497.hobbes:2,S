No, I had rebooted after the initial synchronization was complete.

On those devices that are actually in use, I'd understand CPU being
used; but where the device is not even mounted or used for swap or
whatever, I find that amount of CPU usage very high for just checking
the bitmap... I may take the idle device apart and reassemble without a
bitmap to see whether that makes any difference.
