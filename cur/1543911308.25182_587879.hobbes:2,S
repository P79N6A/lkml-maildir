No I don't have a clue why Pete chose this value.

It appears the ACPI for this platform might work. We don't know because
of a hpet driver probe error discussed below. I assume you're suggesting
the driver is only required by ia64? I think that might not be true.
Well I'm slightly confused. The fs_initcall was first into hpet_alloc.
It appears ACPI discovery failed during driver initialization because
of:
hpet_resources: 0xfed00000 is busy
from dmesg. So why do we have a second hpet registered? Also hpet_alloc
is suspose to check for redundant registration. I need to look more
tomorrow.
