I would guess--if I know I have coded my application properly
(cough) or I am using locks that by design are completely orthogonal,
I would say deadlock checking is getting in the way.

fusyn's is as simple as it can get: when you are about to lock(), it
checks that you don't own the lock already, but it generalizes it
(it checks that the owner of the lock is not waiting for a lock 
whose owner is waiting for a lock whose owner...is waiting for a lock
that you own).
