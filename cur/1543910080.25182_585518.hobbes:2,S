No, that particular argument is bogus, because there is a cache
coherency protocol operating to keep the CPU cache coherent with
stores from other CPUs, but there isn't any such protocol (nor should
there be) for a register used as a "cache".
(Linux requires SMP systems to keep any CPU caches coherent as far as
accesses by other CPUs are concerned.  It doesn't support any SMP
systems that are not cache-coherent as far as CPU accesses are
concerned.  It does support systems with non-cache-coherent DMA.)
