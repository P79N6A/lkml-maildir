Fair enough... there is of course L1_CACHE_BYTES but I'm not positive
that's always the right thing.  If we want to introduce a new constant
then we will have to touch every arch (which is not necessarily a
killer but it means "fixed" drivers won't compile for everyone until
their arch is fixed).
What would you propose?  I don't have strong feelings about the exact
form of a solution but I would like to decide something so we can have
a standard way of fixing drivers that use unaligned DMA buffers (and
convincing maintainers to apply the patches).
Thanks,
  Roland
