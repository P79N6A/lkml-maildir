hello,
since i saw strange things happening with my free memory numbers, i tried 
this:
- i compiled and booted a fresh kernel (no proprietary modules, no patches, 
just 2.4.14-pre4)
- i did free.
bakvis:~# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        384912      55644     329268          0       3652      29880
-/+ buffers/cache:      22112     362800
Swap:       136512          0     136512
so i have 22 meg used right ?
- i started the daily cron jobs (updatedb and htdig  and some minor things 
like log rotation)
- i did 'free' again.
bakvis:~# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        384912     377060       7852          0      29424     125660
-/+ buffers/cache:     221976     162936
Swap:       136512        752     135760
so now there is 220 meg used memory right ?
and the memory is definitely used, because as soon as i start a memory hog 
the system hits swap ...
so what am i missing here ?
should i provide more info about my kernel configuration ? vmstat numbers ?
greetings,
Frank
