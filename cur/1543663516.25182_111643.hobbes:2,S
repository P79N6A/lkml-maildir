arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c, broken_toshiba_keyboard() is the right
place. DMI data are:
        { broken_toshiba_keyboard, "Toshiba Satellite 4030cdt", { /* Keyboard generates spurious repeats */
                        MATCH(DMI_PRODUCT_NAME, "S4030CDT/4.3"),
                        NO_MATCH, NO_MATCH, NO_MATCH
                        } },
