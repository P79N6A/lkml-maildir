Hi!
I'm going to develop some drivers for webcams connected to the USB port,
which are going to be used for a video-conferencing/workgroup software 
actually under development, the very first need i have is to know which
motherboard shall I avoid to purchase.. (so I dont trust very much the USB
ports some have).
Please I need help very soon if some of you where so kind to answer me to
my email address I would be very gratefull..
P.D. I know the USB stack has been developed by our very loved guru
Linus..
¿Linus is there someway to contact you? just a humble question.. maybe
stupid.. I promise to work hard in the USB stack following your inteligent
advice.
Saludos
