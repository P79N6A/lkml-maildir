Without swap, and paging from a solid state device, by far the highest
priority is minimising the amount of ram that the kernel takes up, so I
guess 2.0 will be better.

Not really.  The swapin code is closely related to demand loading, as
you note.  The swapout code is _very_ closely related to the mechanisms
for evicting unused pages of mapped files.  There's not much to be
gained from removing swapping.
