Subject: [PATCH] USB: fix root-hub resume when CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND is not set
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch (as786) removes a redundant test and fixes a problem
involving repeated system sleeps when CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND is not set.
During the first wakeup, the root hub's dev.power.power_state.event
field doesn't get updated, causing it not to be suspended during the
second sleep transition.
This takes care of the issue raised by Rafael J. Wysocki and Mattia
Dongili.
