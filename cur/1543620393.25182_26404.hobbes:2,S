no, the real optimization is that when spin meets spin, they will not
mutex. If a mutex-user has it then spins turn into mutex, but that (is
supposed to) happen rarely.
i think one example *could* be to turn inode->i_sem into a combi-lock. Eg.
generic_file_llseek() could use the spin variant.
this is a real performance problem, i've seen scheduling storms in
dbench-type runs due to llseek taking the inode semaphore.
whether combi-locks truly bring performance benefits remains to be seen,
but the patch definitely needs to provide some working example and some
hard numbers for some real workload.
