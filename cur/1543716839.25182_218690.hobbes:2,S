If you _get_ a clear picture, please let me know.  I've been looking for
one. :)
You're right that the EFI map itself isn't any help to memory hotplug,
but things derived from it are.  The amount and physical locations of
all of the memory in the system are obviously pulled out of this table
at some point, and Linux already has a representation of them, otherwise
we couldn't allocate memory or do things like virt_to_phys() or
page_to_pfn().
I think what Arjan doesn't want is 14 different architectures with 14
different userspace programs reading 14 different things in /proc and
/sys for each of their memory hotplug schemes.  I guarantee you don't
want to know what ppc64 is planning on doing.
BTW, Sourav, what is it that you need from the EFI map?  Could you take
a quick look through the lhms-devel list archives and see if anything
there is similar to what you're trying to do? Here's a place to start:
