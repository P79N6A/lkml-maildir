What if unsigned long long is 96 bit? or 128?

Yup, and 8-Bit CPU and 640 kB RAM ought to be enough for...
nevermind.

Speaking of shifting forward to standards:
unsigned char foo = 42;
char bar[42];
sprintf(bar, "%ju", (uintmax_t)foo); // see IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
If that's too ugly, write your own [u]intmax_t-to-char[] converter, then
only the stack is nasty if uintmax_t is 128 bits wide and you're
printing an array uint8_t. :-P
