That's how it's most often used, indeed.  I do value the environmental
aspect as well: the potential for memory manufacturers (say, for the
$100 laptop) to ship out their broken memories at a low cost, thereby
delivering more products for a given amount of toxic waste created in
the chip etching process.

Many, many people want to.  I've been asked about it a lot, but always
lacked the time to figure out how.

Actually it's broken memory that makes reports unreliable, not the patch :)
After the right set of broken addresses has been applied, the whole system
runs as reliably as any other system.  And I hope people have the wits to
mistrust a system for a while after they've plugged in broken DIMMs ;-)

I doubt that'll be necessary, but yes, it'd be a way out.  Thanks.
