Also, note that any data stored on that machine is potentially
compromised, such as passwords for other boxes, etc.  You should
really also change all of those.  If the box was a firewall, the
rulesets also become known, etc.
I've often wondered whether it would be worth connecting a very large
serial EEPROM to a serial port interface, and have it effectively
appear as a solid state printer, (to that you could cheaply log to an
unmodifyable device).  Has anybody ever tried this?
