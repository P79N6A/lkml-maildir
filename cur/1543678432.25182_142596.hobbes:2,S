Hi
First of all mount hangs in D state when mounting cdrom
(with mount /dev/hdc). This problem seems to appear only if the cdrom
is ejected before (I use a script which does: eject /dev/hdc ;
eject -t /dev/hdc ; mount /dev/hdc).
The trace (Alt+SysRQ+t) is attached. Also a strace of mount is atached.
This doesn't happen at least with 2.5.70mm9
Bye
Calin
