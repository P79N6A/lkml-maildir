The acpi_power_off issue (acpi_power_off is called but the laptop doesn't shut
down) is back (in -mm1 already). I suspect it has never disappear completely:
maybe it only happens in some cenarios (like "only when AC is plugged in" or
something like that). The report is done, I'll try to get more info soon (when
does this happen and when it doesn't) and will report it by then.
