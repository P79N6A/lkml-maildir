Hmmm?  I suspect I'm misreading what you're saying, but to be clear:
Let's say I start a screen session.  In one of those shells, I clone,
specify CLONE_NEWNS, and exec a shell.  now i do a bunch of mounting.
Other shells in the screen session won't see the results of those
mounts, and if i ctrl-d, the shell which started the screen session
can't either.  Each of these is in the "parent filesystem namespace".
OTOH, shared subtrees specified in the parent shell could make it such
that the parent ns, but not others, see the results.  Is that what
you're referring to?
thanks,
