The flip side of that is this could just be added to the list of limits
you set on a multi-user system if you don't want $LUSER to DoS your
server (such as max procs, cpu time, virtual memory, etc.).  I don't
think this is a security issue on single-user systems or servers with
only privileged access.
Admins of multi-user systems are used to having to manage limits (see
pam_limits for example).  Admins of single-user or privileged servers
(e.g. mail or non-shared web servers) are not for the most part (postfix
doesn't open 1025 files in a single process).
