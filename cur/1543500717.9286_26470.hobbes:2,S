: Hang on a minute.  If those were just spin_lock then OK, ignore for
: SMP.  But they are spin_lock_irq which implies the protected code is
: entered from irq as well as normal kernel.  If so, then the locks are
: still needed, even on UP.
: 
: I tried to trace the call tree down to get_next_mport.  AFAICT, it goes
: get_next_mport <- ip_masq_new <- ip_masq_mod_out_create <-
: ip_fw_masquerade <- ip_forward.  If any of those are called from an
: irq, then the lock is still required on UP.  Otherwise it should be
: spin_lock().
Thanks.  That's what I get for mechanically fixing the code late at night.  I
guess the proper behariour would be to just remove the ifdef statements around
all of them including the lock variable.
