Sure if I had one I wouldn't need one from Jeff
(who is frankly currently deeply in the  
"it is much easier to give suggestions if you don't understand the problem"
state) 
The current kernel boots everywhere at least and enables mmconfig 
if the BIOS marks it in e820 (which at least some
systems do). Getting it to this point wasn't easy and required
several iterations.

and the user will never see that message because it hangs? 
I think we had that argument before. IMHO such messages are completely
useless. Hangs are not acceptable no matter what messages are printed
before.

Hanging systems?
