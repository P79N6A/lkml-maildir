Well, as your stuff does not have anything to do with "processes",
putting it in /proc is not acceptable.
sysfs is one value per file, and if that matches up to what you need,
then it should be fine to use.
You do need to have some kind of function for every sysfs entry, but you
can group common ones together (as the hwmon drivers do.)
As you will not have a backing "device" to attach your files to, you
will probably need to deal with "raw" kobjects, and the learning curve
for how to create files in sysfs with them is unfortunatly a bit steep.
But there is lots of working examples in the kernel that do this (block
devices, md, driver core, etc.), there's plenty of code to copy from to
get it to work.
And if that doesn't look like fun, you can always just use create a new
filesystem (only 200 lines of code), or use debugfs.
good luck,
greg k-h
