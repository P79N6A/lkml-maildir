It doesn't quite favor outside LBA's (lower numbers), it's a combination
of sector and device. It's hard to do this right in 2.4 because request
sectors are not absolute but a combination of partion + offset. 2.5 will
have this fixed, generic_make_request remaps buffer heads (well actually
bio's, but same deal) before submitting so the I/O scheduler can be a
bit smarter.

That sounds very odd, swap should be much faster on the outside.
