I'd suggest we strongly discourage side-effects in BUG_ON(). 
That said, it might be safest to just go for 1b - we make side-effects of 
BUG_ON() be _documented_ as a bug, but just for safety, I'd suggest doing
	#define BUG_ON(x) (void)(x)
anyway, if somebody wants to compile without debugging. That will still 
make the side-effects happen if somebody has them (and if there are none, 
the compiler will not generate any code anyway).
In other words: nobody should _depend_ on the side effects, and we should 
flame people who have them. A quick grep shows this:
	mm/slab.c:      BUG_ON(spin_trylock(&cachep->spinlock));
which makes no real sense - it looks like slab really wants to use 
"spin_is_locked()".
I could make some sparse extension that warns about side effects. I 
already calculate the "side-effectiveness" of an expression for other 
reasons..
