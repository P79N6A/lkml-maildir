Well, since you do not mention an fdisk version:
First of all, make sure you have a recent fdisk.
(util-linux-2.10* is certainly OK, a bit older will also work)
Next, invoke it with -b 2048 if your disk has blocksize 2048.
Finally, note that at some point in time kernel partition
handling was aligned with what (some? all?) DOS utilities do,
namely counting in hardware-sized sectors instead of sectors
of fixed size 512. Thus, I suppose all your partition offsets
must be divided by four.
