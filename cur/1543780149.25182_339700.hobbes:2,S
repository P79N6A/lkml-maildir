What are your feelings about this:

 ?
It seems like a cleaner way to do things. How would these patches change
if that were merged?
Concerning the patch specifically:

When comparing this to this:

And to this:

There is a slight discrepancy in the API changes. Obviously, we don't want
to change every caller of create_workqueue() to support this. But, perhaps
you could standardize the handling of the freezer flags (by e.g. creating
a separate _nofreeze version for each).
Also, functions that take a va_list parameter pass the structure (array)
rather than the pointer. See the definition of vprintk() in
include/linux/kernel.h for an example.
Thanks,
