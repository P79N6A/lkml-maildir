I should clarify this.
By all means go ahead and provide broken-out fields where it makes 
sense.  However:
- this *IS* a structure defined by protocol, and which, for all users 
except the 16-bit entry, comes from outside the kernel (bootloader or 
firmware.)
- a newer kernel version can add fields to this structure, but can never 
remove them.  This would cause a potential information loss if the 
current kernel doesn't have all fields available.
- the binary structure is the format that the majority of users will need.
This is directly analogous to how we treat identity information in IDE, 
or PCI configuration space -- some fields are pre-digested, but the 
entire raw information is also available.
