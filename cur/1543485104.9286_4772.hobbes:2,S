Subject: Can't compile 2.2.1 - version.h is missing

/usr/include/linux/version.h (/usr/src/linux/include/linux/version.h) is
missing in the distribution of 2.2.1 I got from www.uk.kernel.org and so
the kernel won't compile - even "make config" won't run.
The only thing I can see I might be doing wrong is I am running gcc
v2.7.0 where v2.7.2 is recommended, but I doubt this would fix this
problem.
