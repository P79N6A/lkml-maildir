Hi Mike,

Irrespective of the usefulness of the "chat" benchmark, it seems
that there is a problem of scalability as long as CLONE_FILES is
supported. John Hawkes (SGI) posted some nasty numbers on a
32 CPU mips machine in the lse-tech list some time ago.

"chat" results for large numbers of CPUs is indicative of a problem -
if a large number of threads share the file_struct through
CLONE_FILES, the performance of the application will deteriorate
beyond 8 CPUs (going by John's numbers). It also indicates how
sensitive can performance be to write access of shared-memory
locations like spin-waiting locks.
Thanks
