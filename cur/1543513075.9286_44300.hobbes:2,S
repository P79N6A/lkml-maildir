Actually I am working on extending SYSV shared memory to be able to
implement posix shared memory. What I need is the ability to resize
shared memory segments. These are now implemented by vmalloc'ing a
contiguous array of size (pages*sizeof(long)). This array has to be
resized in ftruncate.
I thought a little bit longer about your comment and looked at the
implementation. I realized that the actual implementation is only fine
for light usage of shm. We did some tests here with ~400 segments each
128MB and had some problems with oom. Now I understand what happened:
The vmalloc area was filled up. So I think there are more reasons to
change the implementation of SYSV shm.
Is there any sample implementation where somebody handles big arrays,
possibly resizeable?
Greetings
