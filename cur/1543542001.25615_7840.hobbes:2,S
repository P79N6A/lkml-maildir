execve manipulates the struct pt_regs on the stack but you're passing a
copy of the struct pt_regs to it, so sys_execve will manipulate that one
and leave the real stackframe unchanged.  As the result the syscall
will return to the address it got called from - but in the new program -
and not to the entry of the new process.
Fix: don't call sys_execve() yourself, instead copy it's code into your
function new_execve.  Have fun because you're tampering with architecture
dependant code, so you'll have to fix that once for every architecture.
But how about using ptrace(2) insted?  No kernel changes ...
