The way to handle this is to abstract the needed interface
into a set of inline's in one place (hrtime.h) then something like
#ifdef CONFIG_HIRES_TIMERS
static inline void update_hires(struct foo *foo) {
	foo->sub_tick = ...
}
#else
static inline void update_hires(struct foo *foo) {
}
#endif

There are two different questions. Should size of structures change based on
config options, that is what tends to make binaries break. The other is whether
the sub-tick stuff is implemented or not.

It is best if the conditional code is in only a few of places,
like the inline's in an one include file; and the main code in timers
plus any arch dependant stuff.
