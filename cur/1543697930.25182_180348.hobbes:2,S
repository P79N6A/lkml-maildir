Subject: [PATCH] fs/locks.c fcntl_setlease did not check if a file was opened for writing before granting a read lease

Gee, that seemed simple enough.
Keep in mind that I'm new to this whole 'kernel development' thing, and I offer no assurance that my patch actually works.  I only know that it compiles without errors or warnings.
But I THINK this is how a patch would fix the problem, in theory.
This is where the 'theory of a thousand eyes' is going to have to help me out.
TIA guys.
BTW, this patch should be applied to both the 2.4 and 2.6 series of kernels (if it works).
