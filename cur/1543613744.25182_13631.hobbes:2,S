With SEI CMM level 3 for the kernel, complete testing and documentation,
we'd be able to release a new kernel every 5 months, with new drivers
2 years after release of the device, and support for new platforms
2-3 years after their availability, as opposed to 1-2 years before
(IA-64, for instance...)
We'd also kill off all the advantages that the bazaar-style development
style actually has, while gaining nothing in particular, except for
a slow machinery of paper-work. No thanks.
I don't complain when people do proper documentation and testing of
their work; rather the opposite, but it needs to be done on a volunteer
basis, not being forced by some standard. Do you really think Linus
would be able to take all the extra work of software engineering? Think
again. Do you honestly believe he'd accept doing so in a million years?
Fat chance.
Grand software engineering based on PSP/CMM/whatever is fine when you
have a clear goal in mind; a plan stating what to do, detailing
everything meticously. Not so for something that changes directions on
pure whim from one week to the next, with the only goal being
improvement, expansion and (sometimes) simplification. Yes, some people
have a grand plan for their subsystems (I'm fairly convinced that
Alexander Viro has some plans up his sleeve for the VFS, and I'm sure it
involves a lot of ideas from Plan 9. But this is pure speculation, of
course...) and there are some goals (such as the pending transition to a
bigger dev_t, CML2, kbuild 2.5 et al), but most development takes place
as follows: idea -> post on lkml -> long discussion -> implementation ->
long discussion (about petty details) -> inclusion/rejection -> possible
rehash of this...
