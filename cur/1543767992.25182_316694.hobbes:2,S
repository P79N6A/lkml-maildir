Ehem, is ALSA broken ?
I can't spread stereo output to 4 channel. More specific, I can't switch
one of my female jacks between in and out.
Long explanation: I have an
00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corporation 82801EB/ER (ICH5/ICH5R) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 02)
It has three outputs. One is always output, for normal stereo or front in 4
channel. One other is LineIn/Back-for-4-channel. And the third is
Mic/Bass-Center.
In 2.6.11 I have two
toggles in ALSA: 'Spread front to center...' and 'surround jack as input'
Adjusting both I could get to duplicate the output in the Back jack.
In 2.6.12-rc3-mm3 there is no way to get this working.
More, after I booted 2.6.11 to retest, just after reboot in 2.6.12-rc3-mm3
it was working. As soon as I touched the 'Surround Jack Mode' in alsamixer
it went silent again, and I could not restore it.
The old options have been renamed/killed.
Is ALSA broken in kernel ? Is just the userspace out of sync ?
Which should be the correct setup to get this working ?
TIA
