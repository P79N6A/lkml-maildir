I absolutly oppose to the cosmetic naming changes.
Please let module be be initialized by module_init() and exited by
module_exit().  We had a hard enough time to get it everywhere, not
to mention the name makes a lot of sense.
Also MODULE_PARAM should just stay, combined with Keith's proposal
to use it at boottime aswell (as KBUILD_OBJECT.<paramname>).
