This is kind of theoritical, but it seems to me that it would be safer
to write this as
	int ipath_unordered_wc(void)
	{
		return boot_cpu_data.x86_vendor != X86_VENDOR_AMD;
	}
after all, Via is probably going to have an x86-64 CPU one of these
days, and I doubt you've checked that their WC flush is ordered.
