I've usually been compiling with -Os on gcc3 for a while, works for me.

-mm6, -mm3, and -mm4 were compiled with -Os, -mm2 with -O2.  All with gcc 3.3.1
from RedHat Rawhide.  Given how close -mm6, -mm3, and -mm4 are in size, the 12%
or so size saving is almost certainly the efects of -Os rather than changes in
the size of the code.  I could rebuild any of them to get an exact number, but
it would take a while on this laptop....
