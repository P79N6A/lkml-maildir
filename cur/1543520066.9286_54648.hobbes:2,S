Quite frankly, any fix for this is probably going to be more unstable
than just waiting for 2.4.x which has all of this fixed by virtue of
just doing the memory mapping right. I don't think it's very productive
playing with the innards of 2.2.x that much: the whole point of 2.2.x is
to NOT do major changes, and fixing the deadlock on inode->i_sem _is_ a
major change.
