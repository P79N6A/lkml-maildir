That's odd.

I had it in there because when I originally rewrote this 
driver for sysfs it kept cutting off the last character.  I
had to put it aside for a bit and just didn't take it out
last week before I resent it.  I just retried it on local
ia64 and x86 machines and it worked fine on both accounts
without the extra space. 
Andrew, can you please apply the following patch to remove 
space?

matt
