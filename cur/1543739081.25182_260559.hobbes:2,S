Too much - It seems there is a 3Ware HW bug notice saying that for
64Bit 3Ware Controllers on specific Board and or Chipsets (My case
I7501) there are some unwanted noises on the PCI lines which is fixed in
newer Board revisions of the Controllers.
After replacing the 8506 with a newer revision the bug is gone.
