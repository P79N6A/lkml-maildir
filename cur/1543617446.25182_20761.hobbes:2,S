Little gain?  You don't waste kernel space for SCSI drivers that are not
being used.

Each to their own.

Why?  What are you afraid of? :)
If you want the boot process to be just like it is today, and you don't
require any network boot stuff, I think no userspace code will be
needed.  But I can't guess the future...
