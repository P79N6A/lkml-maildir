ugh, PC boards are actually far worse and far more diverse than any 
variances between hypervisors, but i digress.
anyway, my point stands: the Linux kernel is significantly more 
maintainable and easier to QA if it has only a single 'external' 
hypervisor ABI to worry about - and that might as well be VMI. This is a 
really obvious point, i expected the discussion to center more around 
the specifics of such a move ;-)
