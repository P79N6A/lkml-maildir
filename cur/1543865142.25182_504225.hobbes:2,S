The recursion is a concern.  Is there any way in which a cunningly-crafted
device can cause sufficiently deep recursion to crash the kernel?
Also, from reading the replies I think we'd like to see some more
explanation of why this is necessary: are you really really sure that those
disks were incorrectly handling illegal sector numbers?  Knowing the IBM
and Maxtor model numbers might be useful.
I assume you were using a driver in drivers/ide/?  Perhaps this is really
an IDE-layer bug.
