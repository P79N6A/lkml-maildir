Dear Developers,
My desktop/server has been running 2.6.0-test1 kernel for a while and
recently I decided to try new ones but it crashes early on boot giving
me dump on test7-bk5 (as well I've tried test6-bk9 before with the same
crash). pci=noacpi and then acpi=off didn't help - problem persisted
Oops: 0000 [#1]
CPU : 0
EIP: 0060:[<c02312a0>] Not tainted
EFLAGS: 00010286
EIP is at acpi_pci_register_driver+0x30/0x5c
eax: c05432d8 ebx: 00000000 ecx:c045d934   edx: 000000000
esi: c0494514 edi: 00000000 ....

Configuration and some system details are on

Please give me any idea how I can help?
Thank you in advance
