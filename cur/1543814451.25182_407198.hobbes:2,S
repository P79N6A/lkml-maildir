So do you mean this (attached) ? Anyway I end up with -1 kref.
My real task is: I have sysfs directory /sys/A which corresponds to my
module, to my subsystem. There I want to create subdirectories
like /sys/A/B/ and delete them from time to time. So the problem is that
whenver I remove B I end up with A's kref decremented. The attached test
demonstrates this. P;ease, look at its output:
a inited, kref 1
b inited, kref 1
dir A created, A kref 1, B kref 1
dir B created, A kref 1, B kref 1
dir B removed, A kref 1, B kref 1
b_release
a_release       <--- What is this? I removed B, not A ???
kobj B put, A kref 0, B kref 0
dir A removed, A kref 0, B kref 0
kobj A put, A kref -1, B kref 0
Thanks.
