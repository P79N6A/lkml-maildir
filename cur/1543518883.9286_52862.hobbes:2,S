Subject: Possible 2.2.14pre12 bug: set_blocksize message on umount

A rather odd thing that looks like it may indicate a bug.
When I shut down my box just now, as it was unmounting filesystems, I
got this message (copied by hand and retyped but checked):
set_blocksize: b_count 3, dev ide0(3,1), block 1686626
set_blocksize: b_count 1, dev ide0(3,1), block 1686628
set_blocksize: b_count 1, dev ide0(3,1), block 1686629
set_blocksize: b_count 1, dev ide0(3,1), block 1686627
set_blocksize: b_count 1, dev ide0(3,1), block 181674
(Actually, I think there were exclamation points.)
fsck at a later date turned up no errors.
This is kernel 2.2.14pre12 on a UP system.  More details available if
needed.
I saw a similar message once before (same kernel version), but it was on
a reboot and I couldn't read it all the way through before the reboot :(
