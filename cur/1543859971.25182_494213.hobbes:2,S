Something did change. Now it becomes rather difficult to get the box to
hang, though not impossible. Another thing that changed is that now I
can see [parts of] oopses on screen. I've got two pictures of the screen
with different oopses. If you need them, let me know and I'll send them
to you in a separate mail not to pollute lkml with JPEGs.
One of these oopses happened on kernel with lock debugging enabled, but
I can't see anything relevant in dmesg log after resetting the box.
SysRq magic still doesn't work after hang.
As for the problem with module unloading when port is open, your another
patch does fix it indeed.
