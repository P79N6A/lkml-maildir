Subject: [PATCH] fix maxcpus=N parsing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Fix 61ec7567db103d537329b0db9a887db570431ff4: maxcpus=N is now having no
effect on x86_64, and freezing bootup on i386 (because of inconsistency
with the separate maxcpus parsing down in arch/i386, I guess).  That's
because early_param parsing is a little different from __setup parsing,
and needs the "=" omitted: then it seems to work as the original commit
intended (no mention of IO-APIC in /proc/interrupts when maxcpus=0).

Sorry, I noticed this back in -mm, but got diverted by deeper mysteries.
Cc'ed Rusty: I presume there's a good reason why early_param parsing is
confusingly different, but he may know better and want to change it.
It's odd that i386 treats maxcpus=N differently from other architectures:
on i386 it limits cpu_possible_map, on others it just limits what boots
(then powersaved is liable to bring up the others on x86_64 - hmmm).
