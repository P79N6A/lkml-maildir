[snip]
attached is a slightly more anal retentive version of my previous patch. 
as in the previous patch, the goal is to make update_lvi completely 
self-contained, ie resistant to changes in higher-level code, ie not 
deadlock even if somebody really sets it up with bad state, also 
eliminates one if/then/else thinko in 0.12 that could theoretically 
cause dac to be started when you're trying to record, which would cause 
a deadlock.
