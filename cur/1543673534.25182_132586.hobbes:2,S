I kinda sorta agree. Holding up 2.6.0 for other ports to catch up
could end up with us waiting, and in the meantime, Linus merging other
stuff which could break non-x86 etc..
Once we're into 2.6.x though, would it be unfeasable to hold off on
final point releases until arch maintainers have sent in a 'make things
work for this release' diff ? Ie, make rc's "strict bugfixes only, and
arch updates"
Though, for some archs (sparc32 springs to mind), we may end up waiting
quite a while, so perhaps just settle on a handful of 'to be kept
up-to-date' archs ?
