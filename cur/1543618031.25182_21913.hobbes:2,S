Subject: [PATCH] O(1) scheduler: asm offset changed
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Ingo's O(1) scheduler moved the location of the processor entry in
task_struct (and also renamed it cpu).  The hard coded offsets in
entry.S, however, were not updated.
This patch, against 2.5.3-pre2 + J2, sets the correct offset and renames
processor to cpu.
Note that nothing actually uses these offsets :-) at the moment but code
used to and may again.  Most importantly, preempt-kernel does!
Thanks,
	Robert Love
