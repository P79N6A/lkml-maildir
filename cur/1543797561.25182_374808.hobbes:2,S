Hello dear Kernel-Developers,
I've the problem that I've connected two keyboards
(one via usb and one via ps/2) to my machine and I want to have
different keyboard layout on it.
While I was trying to find out what would be the best way to do that,
I was somehow surprised that keyboards are not presented via
a device file to userspace.
My questions are:
- Is there a reason not to have devices for keyboards?
- If I would implement it into a recent kernel, would it have any chance
  getting into mainline?
I know this would have some consequences for user space, at least those:
- x11 (x.org/xfree) would have to modify their input device section for Linux
  for keyboards
- loadkeys would have to be patched so one could specify which keyboard
  to change the layout for
- kde/gnome would have to be changed in the manner that they support more
  than one keyboard
Nico
