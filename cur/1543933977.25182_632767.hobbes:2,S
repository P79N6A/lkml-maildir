if you want to see the current x86.git intention then do:
 git-clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git linux-2.6.git
 cd linux-2.6.git
 git-branch x86
 git-checkout x86
 git-pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git mm
right now the default is io_delay=udelay.
