Here is an excerpt from speedo_get_stats()
   1880         if (dev->start) {
   1881             unsigned long flags;
   1882             /* Take a spinlock to make wait_for_cmd_done and sending the
   1883              * command atomic.  --SAW */
   1884             spin_lock_irqsave(&sp->lock, flags);
   1885             wait_for_cmd_done(ioaddr + SCBCmd);
   1886             outb(CUDumpStats, ioaddr + SCBCmd);
   1887             spin_unlock_irqrestore(&sp->lock, flags);
   1888         }
Which driver version are you looking at? :-)

I know about mdio_read() problem.
mdio_read() is used only in
 - initialization code (no special care is needed)
 - timer routine
 - TX timeout routine (these two are exclusive against each other)
 - ioctl
The easiest solution is to make reading ioctl being privileged too.

Not exactly.  The timings are bus (rather than CPU) bounded.
Discussion is welcome, but it's obviously not a so urgent problem.

Any specific example?

It's compatible with previous versions of the driver.
