Ok, I've now shuffled both sticks thru both "B" sockets on this mobo, 
and neither one could run memburn more than 20 minutes, and again, 
the errors are all in the xx of nnnnxxnn in hex display formats.
So, I've put both sticks back in, in the A and B2 sockets ATM.  That 
ran about 25 minutes before memburn got a tummy ache.  In the 
meantime I'd rebuilt 2.6.9-rc1-mm1 with hi-mem support again, and the 
last reboot I took a detour thru the bios and turned the memory 
voltage up 100mv to 2.6 volts.  Running memburn against 400 megs of 
it has now been running for around 40 minutes.
So, my question for the hardware folks is: Whats the proper voltage to 
run a bank of DDR400 dimms in Dual Channel mode?
Humm, I spoke too soon, memburn has exited, with this:
Ahh, fudge, one cannot copy/paste from a virtual term.  Suffice to say 
that the address is odd, that the error is in the usual 3rd byte of 4 
position within the 32 bit read.
Since it appears that TCWO is gone, bankrupt or whatever, and I like 
the features of this board otherwise, can someone suggest howto go 
about getting a warranty replacement direct from Biostar?  I'll go 
visit the web page again, but I don't recall seeing any suitable 
links the last time I was there checking on updated bios files.
