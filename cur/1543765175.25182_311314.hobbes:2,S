mutex_setprio() , I don't know if you could call that an API but that's
what I was talking about.. They should both use that. I think it would
be better if the RT mutex (and fusyn) didn't depend on a field in the
task_struct to retain the old priority. That would make it easier ..
This goes back to the assumption that the locking isn't intermingled
once you get into the kernel . The RT mutex can safely save the owner
priority with out a Fusyn jumping in and changing it and the other way
around..
