Hum... I guess you didnt read my mail... I basically agree with Ulrich.
I just wanted to say that a fast application cannot rely only on a "let's park 
N threads waiting for single event in this queue", and hope kernel will be 
smart for us.
Even with 128-ways, you still hit a central point of coordination (it can be a 
mutex in kevent code, a atomic uidx in userland, or whatever) for a 'kevent 
queue'. Once you paid the cache lines ping/pong, you wont be *fast*.
I wish *you* dont think of kevent of only dispatching HTTP 1.0 trivial web 
requests.
Being able to direct a particular request on a particular CPU is certainly 
something that cannot be hardcoded in 'the new kevent interface'.
