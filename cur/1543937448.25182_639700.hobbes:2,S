Hi,
My powerpc build-all-defconfigs script found the following:
mpc837x_mds_defconfig. Brokage looks like it came from libata's
for_each_sg() patch.
drivers/ata/sata_fsl.c: In function 'sata_fsl_fill_sg':
drivers/ata/sata_fsl.c:337: error: redeclaration of 'si' with no linkage
drivers/ata/sata_fsl.c:326: error: previous declaration of 'si' was here
powerpc_allyesconfig:
drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c: In function 'ehea_driver_sysfs_add':
drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:2812: error: 'struct device_driver' has no member named 'kobj'
drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:2815: error: 'struct device_driver' has no member named 'kobj'
drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:2818: error: 'struct device_driver' has no member named 'kobj'
