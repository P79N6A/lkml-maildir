Hi,

Me too, same messages...
>DMA gets disabled with following messages: 
hda: timeout waiting for DMA 
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14 
my dmesg: 
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes

an other chipset but the same problem...
There are more ide_dma_timeout problems known with other chipsets. 
It seems to be an chipset independent problem, it exits also in 2.4.0,
(see 
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/2001week02/1429.html
)
and in 2.4.1-ac9.
Are any fixes known?
p.s. 
  Please cc: me explicitly, because i am not on the list. 
thanks 
    Frank
