1) You can always submit a patch, and see whether other people approve of it.
2) If you won't do it, why would somebody else working on something that
   provides lower latency to user process response time, or improvement
   to the IDE drivers, take the time to deal with this issue?
You need to either do 1), or convince somebody to do 2).
As it is, there are plenty of other denial-of-service type attacks
that can be performed that would be more effective than the 'exploit'
you have mentioned. Your proposal would need to be 'fix them all', if
your complaint is that Linux has a security hole.
If you complaint is that an administrator might mistakenly believe
that it is a security feature, I suggest your understand that this is
merely one issue of quite a few. If the administrator is not aware of
issues such as these, perhaps they should not be an administrator?
