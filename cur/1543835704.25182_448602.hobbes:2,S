Massive hardware problems don't count. ext2/ext3 doesn't look much better in
such cases. I had a machine with RAM gone bad (no ECC - I wonder what
idiot ordered a machine without ECC for a server, but anyways) and it
fucked up every 64th bit - only in a certain region. Guess what happened
to the fs when it went into e2fsck after a reboot. Boom. Same with a
dead DPTA that lost every 16th block or so, the rescue in the first case
was swapping the RAM and "amrecover" and in the second swapping the
drive and "dsmc restore". OTOH, kernel panics on bad blocks are a no-no
of course.

Don't use write caches then. (Though I've seen NUL-filled blocks in new
files or appended to files after in 2001 or 2002.)

SUSE removed JFS support from their installation tool for "technical
reasons" they didn't specify in the release notes. Whatever.

Plus, it and its tools are maintained.
