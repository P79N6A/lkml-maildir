I tried to reproduce this, but this time when I tried to suspend, the
machine just hung with a message showing saying the system was
suspending.  When I touched my Synaptics mousepad after about ten
seconds of waiting, the system suddenly suspended.  Upon resuming, I
checked dmesg and found the time seems to be totally out of whack:
