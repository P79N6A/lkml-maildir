Caution is advised when depending upon crypto systems that use relative 
block numbers as IV.  The security may not be a strong as hoped.
There are some who believe that "not unique" IVs (across multiple 
filesystems) facilitates some methods of cryptanalysis.
Strong security is the reason absolute block numbers were chosen at
the time I introduced loop.c cipher-block-chaining support (in 
kernel 2.1.130).  This has the unfortunate side effect of preventing 
filesystem relocation... leading some to claim that loop.c is now 
broken.  A crypto system is only as strong as its weakest link.
Perhaps losetup can allow the user to specify a "IVseed" value
and then pass to the transfer modules IVseed + relative block.
This would also allow existing absolute block based encrypted file
systems to be relocated (IVseed = absolute # of 1st block), satisfy
those among us who demand unique IVs, and allow those who prefer 
operational convenience at the cost of weaker security to do so.
