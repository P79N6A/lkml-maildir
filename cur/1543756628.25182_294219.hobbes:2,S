I know that Al Borchers -- who wrote those -- did so with that
specific notion.  And it certainly makes sense to me, in
principle, that such primitives exist in the kernel ... maybe
with some tweaks first.  (And docs for all the wait_* calls?)
But nobody's pressed the issue before, to the relevant audience:
namely, LKML.  I'd be interested to hear what other folk think.
Clearly these particular primitives don't understand how to cope
with nested spinlocks, but those are worth avoiding anyway.
