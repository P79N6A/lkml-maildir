Well, it depends. Most of the time, DRI uses AGP which is a different
story altogether.
DRI suffers from similar issue when using PCI GART, but then, it also
doesn't use the consistent alloc routines, it gets pages with GFP,
mmap those into userland, and does pci_map_single in the kernel on
each individual page to obtain the bus addresses. This will not be
pretty on non-coherent architectures though.
