code clean up are not without risk and with no regression test suite to
verify
that a "cleanup" has not broken something. Cleanups are very much a
hindrance to stabilization. With no know working points in a code
history it becomes difficult
to bisect changes and figure out when bugs were introduced
Especially when cleanups are mixed in with bug fixes.
Pretty code does not equal correct code.
