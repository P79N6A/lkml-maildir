All of these are low use functions, primarily used when bringing up
cpus.  So reverting the patches does not have a big effect on the stack
size problem.

Well I did have a different approach but Rusty seemed to really be
attached to work_on_cpu.  (The alternate was to add a 2nd cpumask to the
task struct to hold current->cpus_allowed while setting it to a special
cpus_allowed mask.)
In any case, except for the get_online_cpus() call, work_on_cpu is a
fairly straight forward approach.  But I'm just not familiar enough
with the whole locking scheme to determine whether the cpu hotplug lock
has already been taken, which is causing this weird lockdep warning.
And I don't know of an adaptive way to do it (figure out in work_on_cpu()
if get_online_cpus() should be called or not.)
About the return 0, it was the default return for another error case.
Should the function panic because it can't read a cpu reg?  That seems
wrong too.
Thanks,
Mike
