Yes - since an upcall (indirectly) to a different process while in write
could cause writepage to write out memory to a mount - which could hang
if on an already dead tcp session, this (reconnection - failover to new
ip address if the server ip address changes after failure) may be too
risky to do in the context of writepage, but there may be a way to keep
refusing to do writepage while in the midst of this harder form of mount
reconnection - which isn't likely to be any worse than not
reconnecting.  Fortunately, most tcp reconnection cases are much
simpler.
