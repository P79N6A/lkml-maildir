Yep you're right.  It was the change where we removed the
netif_poll_enable call from e1000_open.  The problem is that
e1000_close calls e1000_down which in turn calls netif_poll_disable.
That means the next e1000_open won't reenable polling and the
dev_close (or in fact any call to netif_poll_disable) after that
will hang.
In fact my original premise is completely wrong since netif_poll_enable
can be safely called from dev_open *if* you can guarantee that no polls
have already been scheduled.
This should be the case as long as we keep IRQs disabled before
netif_poll_enable.  So the problem is that somehow we're getting
into e1000_open with IRQs enabled on the NIC which then causes a
poll to be scheduled before the call to netif_poll_enable.
So please revert my patch.
We need to find out why we're getting IRQs before calling
e1000_irq_enable in e1000_open.
Cheers,
