Yes, we could probably have gone that way.  radix-tree would need some
enhancements for the find-next-above thing.
radix-tree has some features (tags, gang-lookup, gang-lookup-by-tag) which
idr doesn't.  Fitting them all into the one storage API would be nice, I
guess.  radix-tree does potentially use more memory, although that'll only
be significant for collections which are both large and sparse.
Still, people can use either facility at present.  The person who does any
such consolidation would do the kernel-wide migration at the same time.
