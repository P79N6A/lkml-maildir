They cannot find exact border. It's easy to find out that some of Above.net's
servers are blocked and what adresses are assigned to Above.net. It's not easy
(or perhaps even impossible for outsiders) to find out what exactly is blocked.
So the whole net is marked as "bloking one".

This is strange :-( If they are in ORBS static list them why ORBS tried
to probe them ? Hmm. Anyway I can not find mail.linux.com (210.201.200.216) in
ORBS right now. Neither as "Open Relay" (216.201.200.206.relays.orbs.org) nor
as "Non Open Relay" (216.201.200.206.ok.orbs.org)... If you are using different
IP address as source for outgoing traffic then you can just tune you system
slightly, that's all.

I can not see how mail.linux.com is affected :-(

If it'll become my problem I know how to fix it :-) I can not change ISP
(it's school and we had no choice) but I have quite a few friends who can
work as mail relay for me if our ISP will be stupid enough to try to block
ORBS. BTW my first discovery of ORBS was when it sent me mail where I was
notified about possibility to use our system as open-relay.

Not nazi police but more like phone company master :-) And yes, phone company
master CAN ask me to show him what's connected to my phone line. And it WILL
shut up phone line if I'll refuse to do this. It's perfectly legal here (though
usually phone master is to lazy to go to my home :-)

And which address is affected ? 210.201.200.216 is not there.

They are added there. As "open relay piked up by automated system".

Exactly. There are NO WAY to automatically find out which servers are bloking
ORBS and which are not. So they are all marked as "netblock entry":
-- cut --
[khim@dell khim]$ host 177.196.126.207.relays.orbs.org.
177.196.126.207.relays.orbs.org has address 127.0.0.4
-- cut --
It's up to admin to allow or refuse "netblock entries". Hmm. Perhaps I should
add check for .ok.orbs.org. before check for relays.orbs.org. ...

There are NO automatic procedure to find blocking. Thus all automatisation
works ONLY till bloking attempts are detected.
