Yes. And one more thing.  We can't assume every page in a file is XIP or not.
However, I still can't get even the existing get_xip_page() to work
for me so we are getting ahead of ourselves;)  Looking back on this
thread I realize I haven't confirmed if my cramfs_get_xip_page() gets
a page struct.  I assume that is my problem?  The UML find_iomem()
probably returns psuedo iomem with page structs.  While ioremap() does
not return with page struct backed memory.
