That is indeed a good question. At least for 10G eHEA we see
that the average number of packets/poll cycle is very low.
With high precision timers we could control the poll interval
better and thus make sure we get enough packets on the queue in
high load situations to benefit from LRO while keeping the
latency moderate. When the traffic load is low we could just
stick to plain NAPI. I don't know how expensive hp timers are,
we probably just have to test it (when they are available for
POWER in our case). However, having more packets
per poll run would make LRO more efficient and thus the total
CPU utilization would decrease.
I guess on most systems there are not many different network
cards working in parallel. So if the driver could set the poll
interval for its devices, it could be well optimized depending
on the NICs characteristics.
Maybe it would be good enough to have a timer that schedules
the device for NAPI (and thus triggers SoftIRQs, which will
trigger NAPI). Whether this timer would be used via a generic
interface or would be implemented as a proprietary solution
would depend on whether other drivers want / need this feature
as well. Drivers / NICs that work fine with plain NAPI don't
have to use timer :-)
I tried to implement something with "normal" timers, but the result
was everything but great. The timers seem to be far too slow.
I'm not sure if it helps to increase it from 1000HZ to 2500HZ
or more.
