OK, you're an idiot :).  It only worked before because all the files
that lilo used just happened to be below cylinder 1024.  Your partition
goes past cyl 1024 and your new kernel is using space above 1024.  Find
a version of lilo that can cope with cyl >= 1024 (is there one?) or
move the kernel below cyl 1024.  You might need to repartition your
disk to get / all below 1024.
