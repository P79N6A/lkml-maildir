Ah! You don't want to have the X11 overhead of VMware. Quite an idea.
If I get it right, your setup looks like:
  guest writes to /dev/ttyS0
  vmware connects its virtual S0 to the host's ttyFakeS0
  minicom on the host to ttyFakeS0
or even
  vmware S0 to host's ttyS0
  other remote machine do minicom to ttyS0
The reason for FakeS0 is that vmware does not know about ptys, 
unfortunately.
