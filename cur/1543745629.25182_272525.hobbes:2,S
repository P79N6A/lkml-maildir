The reason ____request_resource() is used for combined mode is to
facilitate libata taking one PCI device, and IDE driver taking another
PCI device.  This is done because libata did not support PATA, and so,
could not drive the PATA controller.
Now PATA and ATAPI are working, so we could present the IMO ideal
situation:  libata can support combined mode best by supporting both
PATA and SATA controllers, on the ICH5.  That way DMA works for both
PATA and SATA (DMA doesn't work for PATA, in split-driver configuration),
and there is no split-driver to worry about.
I think there may need to be some code to prevent the IDE driver from
claiming the legacy ISA ports.
