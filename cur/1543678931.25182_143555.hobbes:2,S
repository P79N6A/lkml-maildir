You are of course aware of the fact that gcc is already a testimony to
the fact that such a compiler can be made from scratch, aren't you?
If it's been done once, it could be done again if there was need. But
there really isn't (once and again one might wish for the gcc crew to
spend a little concern on compile-times though, since things seem to get
slower every release...)
