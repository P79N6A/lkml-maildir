I am explicitly refraining from sending Alan any code that is not
well-tested in 2.5 and my machines first.  As Ingo's new switch_mm()
bits are not even in 2.5 yet, I plan to wait a bit before sending
them... (I am currently putting together all the scheduler bits we have
been working on for a 2.4-ac patch...)
If you like, Alan can hold off on this and take it when the appropriate
patches are in.
