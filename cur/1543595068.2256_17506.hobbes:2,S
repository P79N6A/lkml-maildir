So if someone wants to increase it for an application he needs to be sure
that everything that it is linked with is compiled with a similar
__FD_SETSIZE ?
Why can you safely increase the value in Squid then ?

Yes, but still, why 1024 ?

No, squid takes the lowest of both (FD_SETSIZE and SQUID_MAXFD) in main.c.
And the Squid configure gets the FD_SETSIZE value from linux/posix_types.h
;(

I'm still not convinced that something might break, since everybody
advices to increase __FD_SETSIZE before compiling Squid.
And if linux/posix_types.h defines the limit of open file descriptors of
the system, 1024 is (IMO) a wrong number. But then again, nobody bothered
to change it...
Thanks for your respons.
