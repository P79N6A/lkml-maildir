Actually, I didn't say that C++ is bloat. I said C++ makes "it much
easier to write bloatware". Big difference.

Good. That means they'll approach it with caution, rather than jumping
on the bandwagon.

Not when the language seduces you into writing bloatware. The more
powerful the language and the more abstract the concepts it supports,
the further the programmer is taken away from understanding what's
happening at the low level. That leads to bloatware.
If I had my way, no CS student would graduate unless they understood
what's happening at the low level and had experience benchmarking and
optimising code. A good start would be to have at least one assignment
where they have to write a reasonably complex piece of code, in any
language, and their marks are based on how fast the code runs. And the
marks should be scaled down if everyone writes code which is much
slower than the instructor's.
