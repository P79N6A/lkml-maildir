Subject: Keyboard and mouse interfere in 2.6

Hi, is there any way the input from the keyboard can interfere with
the input from the mouse?  Because they are interfering, on my
computer.  If I hold ctrl, the mouse jumps randomly about if I try to
move it.  And then the ctrl key gets stuck in the 'on' position until
I rapidly tap it to somehow get it reset.
The same occurs for the shift key, which is very disturbing as it
opens every possible right-click menu on my GUI.
It's not the video card: I've used 2 different cards since the problem
started.  It's not the sound card either, as I have used 2 different
sound cards as well.  The problem started when I switched from 2.4 to
2.6, and seems confined entirely to the keyboard and mouse drivers.
I have a USB mouse, and a PS/2 keyboard; both worked perfectly before
2.6.  I run fvwm, and a recent compile of X.org.  Video driver is "S3
Savage4" or a proprietary Nvidia one, take your pick.  (The Nvidia
card went and broke on me, S3 is on-board.)
I don't think quoting the whole .config would be appreciated, but
here's what seemed like it would be relavent.  Is there any setting I
might have not properly applied?
