You would seem to be correct.

And here too:-/

Unfortunately not.  I wonder if remount should be getting a writelock on the
s_umount sem, but I don't see why not.  grab_super() also gets a writelock on
it, and so that could cause problems too.
shrink_dcache_for_umount_subtree() doesn't care because it doesn't scan the
dcache_unused list, but as you say, other things are affected.

I think that's reasonable.  I wonder if we can avoid removing it from the list
in the first place, but I suspect it's less optimal.
