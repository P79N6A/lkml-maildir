Then you haven't been keeping up with Open-source projects, or the 
literature.  The development of virtual servers composed of clusters of 
Linux boxes on a private network appears to be a single machine to the 
outside world.  Indeed, a highly scaled Web site using such a cluster is 
indistinguishable from one using a mainframe-class computer (which for the 
past 30 years have been networks of specialized processors working together).
The difference is that the bulk of the nodes are on a private network, not 
on a public one.  Actually, the machines I have seen have been on a weave 
of networks, so that as data traverses the nodes you don't get a bottleneck 
effect.
It's a lot different than the Illiac IV I grew up with...
