I've noticed this, but only w/ one process in particular. and I do not
have a uni-processor system for comparison, so I do not know if this
process is supposed to take 100% cpu utilization, or not (i suspect not,
I find it difficult to believe that a process is designed w/ 100% cpu
utilization in mind).
        pump
when I use pump to connect to my cable, it _consistently_ soaks one of the
cpu's. (that is to see that when I look at xosview, one of the CPU's is
running 100%, the other is "my other tasks".)
This is running kernel 2.2.5 (will be trying 2.2.14 this weekend), and
pump from RH 6.1
