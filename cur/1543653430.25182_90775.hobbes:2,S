 ...just like it did a few kernels ago (the current->mm issue in 2.5.19
   that eventually got fixed in 2.5.30 or thereabouts, introduced for the
   bk-enabled by cset 1.373.221.1).
 I'll go building a 2.5.44 kernel (think it's the only one I didn't have
   too much trouble building / booting in the 2.5.4x series before .47)
   and see whether it works or not.
I'd like to try to reproduce this, Alessandro.  Could you forward me
the other details about the server you're experiencing the problem on?
