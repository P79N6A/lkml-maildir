 Well, does any SMP board map anything into the local APIC space?  After
saying there a real APIC there???  Now *THAT* is completely unsafe.  How
is that supposed to work when there actually is an APIC-equipped CPU put
in?
 Poking unoccupied space leads to bus error exceptions for certain archs
but I can't actually recall existence of such events for i386...
