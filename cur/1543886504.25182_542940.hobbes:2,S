I'd be happy to have them.  While it's not the nicest API in the world
it's in Posix and we have to support it at the library level, so we
should better get it right.
I'd like to avoid having a big swithc statement in every filesystem,
though, instead of we should have a table-driven approach instead
where each filesystem defines one table (or multiple ones when it
supports subtypes with different limits) and just sets a pointer in
the superblock to it.
E.g.
long foofs_pathconf {
	[_PC_LINK_MAX]		= 16384,
	[_PC_2_SYMLINKS]	= 1,
	...
}
and then in fill_super:
	sb->s_pathconf = &foofs_pathconf;
