After looking at the futex_compat code some more, this is what I
ended up with. Please look closely at the changes, as I have not
actually tested them, being on a 32 bit machine at the moment.
I'd suggest merging the first patch in 2.6.23 instead of the original
one from David Miller, and the other two for 2.6.24.
