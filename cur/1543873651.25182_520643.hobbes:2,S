Not caching a needed page and having to wait for a disk seek
to complete will be *way* more expensive than any call to
mark_page_accessed().
A modern CPU can do somewhere on the order of 50 million
instructions in the time it takes to bring one page in from
disk.
However, this does not mean we should unconditionally call
mark_page_accessed(), since that could cause use to push
wanted data out of the cache because of one program that
does its streaming accesses in a strange way...
This is a situation where getting it right almost certainly
matters.
