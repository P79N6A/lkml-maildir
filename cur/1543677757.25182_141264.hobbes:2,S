Subject: [PATCHSET] 2.4.21-dis4 released
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/17/193

Highlights (* updated):
 * ACPI 2003-05-23
 * Software Suspend 1.0_pre9 with (newly required) swsusp.c
 * CPUfreq
 * Orinoco Monitor Mode 0.13b
 * ATI Radeon Mobility framebuffer update (from benh)
 * Don't allow ACPI S4 sleep unless swsusp is compiled in
 - Optional Inspiron I8500 DSDT
 - Don't deadlock when creating ext3 journal at mount time
 - Optionally disable trackpad while typing (2003-05-27)
 - Netdev-Random to allow NICs to contribute to random pool
 - Vfat-Symlinks to let vfat show .lnk files as symlinks
 - O_STREAMING to allow manual drop-behind of page cache (for multimedia
and other 'read one and throw away' access methods)
 - BCM4400 integrated
As before, there is a custom ACPI DSDT included for the Inspiron 8500;
be sure not to enable that (inside make config/menuconfig/xconfig) on
any other machine!
All the notes/details/etc are at 
http://www.gotontheinter.net/kernel/.
 
The patch is against 2.4.21-pre8 (released as 2.4.21) and builds cleanly
with gcc-3.3 (gcc-3.2 is no longer recommended, gcc-2.95.3 is still the
baseline)
Now that I've got it into source management, if there is interest I will
add split patches to the website for a 'mix and match' approach.
For -dis5, coming to a webserver near you sometime soon, expect:
 + Supermount
 + preempt
 + low-latency
 + ..? feedback welcome
