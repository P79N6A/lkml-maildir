Interesting argument, but it breaks for at least two reasons:
1. You can buy that box instead of just hiring it. That moves kernels 
"outside the company",
    for money even.
2. It doesn't matter if they only move kernels withing their own 
companys equipment.
    If they lend a customer equipment containing a linux kernel, then 
they're lending
    them a linux kernel.  Lending is distribution!

The argument might be fine, if they were moving linux kernels into 
company equipment
used by company personell only.  (I.e. linux-powered 
desktops/servers/gadgets for their employees.)
And it might not.  Maybe they actually have to distribute source to 
employees too, if they
request it.  The GPL only mentions recipients, no exceptions for 
"internal company use".  A company
may perhaps demand that the employees never request the source, though. 
Or perhaps
"internal use" is covered by the company being a "legal unit".
People breaking the GPL should be taken seriously.  Fortunately, the 
solution is easy for
GPL-breakers.  Break someone else's license, and they have to pay 
damages.  Break the GPL,
and all you need to do is to stuff some source code onto a public 
(web/ftp)server - and all is fine again.
The situation is so cheap and _easy_ to rectify, that is one reason 
people gets so pissed off at
a violation.  It is not as if complying with the GPL would be any kind 
of burden to them.
