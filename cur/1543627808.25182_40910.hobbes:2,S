Hi Nikita,
I did not look deeper into F_NOTIFY, but if I only get a SIGNAL I don't
know _what_ has happened (or better on what file something has
happened). But to process the new / updated files I need the filename.
If I only learn which directory was updated I still have to find out
_which_ file is new or was changed.
Regards,
;Martin
