This is exactly what happens on Linux, except
that the switching can also happen mid-request
(but it usually won't happen very often).
There still is the issue of cache flushing
though. Keeping the threads on their own
CPU does not alleviate the program of pushing
the data from one thread back to the other
(or from one CPU to the other).
