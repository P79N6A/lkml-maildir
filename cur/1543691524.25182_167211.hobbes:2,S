Your interrupts look fine, this is the way they should be.

You can try downgrading your drive to udma5 to see if udma6 really does make
it more stable (hdparm -X udma5 /dev/hdX) but I can't think of any reason
why it should.

I've been telling people to disable APIC / ACPI because of the interrupt
problem, but your interrupts are fine, so I'd leave it alone.  I'm curious,
what version BIOS do you have?
