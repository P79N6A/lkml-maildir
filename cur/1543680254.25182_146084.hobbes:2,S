I found this great command which really helps.  Only 1337 kernel
gnurus know about it, now u can be 1 2 :)
$ man mmap2
[...]
       The  function mmap2 operates in exactly the same way as mmap(2), except
       that the final argument specifies the offset into the file in units  of
       the  system  page  size  (instead of bytes).
