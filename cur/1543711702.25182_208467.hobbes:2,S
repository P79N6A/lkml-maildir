There's no such thing as atomic writes bigger than a sector really, we
just pretend there is. Timing usually makes this true.
For bigger atomic writes, 2.4 SUSE kernel had some nasty hack (called
blk-atomic) to prevent reordering by the io scheduler to avoid partial
blocks from databases. For 2.6 it's much easier since you can just send
a 16kb write out as one unit. So you send out the db data page as 1
hardware request, which is pretty much as atomic as you can do it from
the OS point of view. As long as you avoid a big window between parts of
this data page, you've narrowed the window of breakage from many seconds
to miliseconds (maybe even 0, if drive platter inertia guarentees you
that the write will ensure the data is on platter).
