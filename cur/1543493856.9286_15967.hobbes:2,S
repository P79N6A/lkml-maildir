I've recently compiled kernel 2.2.6.
At one point during the boot, there are two complaints somewhat like
"modprobe: Couldn't find module net-pf-19".
After these two lines, there's a error message about not being able to
execute the call SIOCADDRT.
Now I wonder: What is the module "net-pf-19"?  I can't find it
mentioned in any documentation and I don't find it in the kernel
sources.
Also, the lack of this module seems to prevent me from removing
entries from the routing table, since, if I do "route del ..." I get
  SIOCDELRT: No such process
This seems to be caused by a failing call
  socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
Have I enabled some kernel option which only hackers with special code
available should use?  How do I get rid of these refrences to the
module net-pf-19?
