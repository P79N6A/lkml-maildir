printf() prints to stdout i.e. filedescriptor #1. If you do not
open stdin/stdout/stderr in your program, you do not know what
is going to be fd #1 later on .. in your case, the socket probably
is fd #1 and the printf() is happily printing to it.
To prevent this, do something like this at the start of your program:
	int n;
	do {
		n = open("/dev/null", O_RDWR);
	} while (n >= 0 && n <= 2);
	close(n);
