Well, yes, you only need the cache flush macros on memory that *isn't*
consistent.

I mean replace xxx_alloc_consistent() with kmalloc() and appropriate
calls to map_single() (or whatever) in those cases where we actually
care about reducing our usage of (genuinely) consistent memory and it
is possible to do so.

Well, with James approach you need a dma_sync() of some sort in pretty
much exactly the same places you need a map_single() or similar if you
used kmalloc() to start with.
