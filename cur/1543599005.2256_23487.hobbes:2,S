	[snip evidence beyond all doubt]
Earlier today some talking between VM developers resulted
in us agreeing on trying to fix this problem by implementing
dynamic window scaling for readahead, using heuristics not
all that much different from TCP window scaling.
This should make the system able to withstand a higher load
than currently, while also allowing fast data streams to
work with more efficiently than currently.
