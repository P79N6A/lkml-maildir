You are forgetting that this case should be converted to and 255 or a
plain byte reference by any optimizing compiler - and gcc surely is,
on x86 this code can be reduced to around 2 cycles (Pentium: mov, or, jnz,
with preceding code intertwined to cancel stalls and jnz being likely in
the code buffer)...
