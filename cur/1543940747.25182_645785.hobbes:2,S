Wow, thanks.
I have to say I already did this for myself, but I had to
change too many things to simply resubmit without testing. And it turned
out porting mmiotrace to x86/mm was a non-trivial task. I have not
been able to test yet even though I have been working on it every night.
Today I will see if things work for me, and hopefully also for someone else.
I might send new patches today or tomorrow, if all goes well.
btw. I have a bad feeling about global_flush_tlb() disappearing, it was used
in mmiotrace code, and I don't know what to use instead. The obvious
replacement for it is a static function elsewhere. Currently I am simply
hoping it was a redundant leftover from the time when we had trouble making
mmiotrace stable.
To be honest, I haven't yet had the time to educate myself about what is
TLB.

Here I had to change to irqsave/irqrestore versions, as I found a possible
lock dependency issue. Lockdep debugging code pointed it out. I'm not sure
I fixed it completely, but using spin_lock_irqsave() is a safe bet.

And here. And I also removed sync RCU and might_sleep().

This looks prettier than my code. I might change my code to this.

This is the non-trivial change that I really want to test before
submitting again. The call site of the handlers changes, and vmalloc
related faults reach the custom handlers. I don't think this would be a
problem for mmiotrace, but I don't know enough to be sure.
I guess using vmalloc'd memory from a page fault handler would be doomed,
anyway, so no point worrying about it, right?
if (unlikely(handle_custom_pf(regs, error_code, address)))
Maybe like this, even?
It is still supposedly making a function call every time, at least
when CONFIG_PAGE_FAULT_HANDLERS is defined. Would it have a non-negligible
impact on performance when no custom handlers are registered?
My original version had the separate inline function to check if the list
is empty. Which one is preferrable?
I'm hoping distros would ship some kernels with PAGE_FAULT_HANDLERS
enabled as it would make contributors' lives easier. IIRC some
already have enabled RELAY and DEBUG_FS for mmiotrace. This is why I
think keeping the performance impact to the minimum here is important,
for the case of no custom handlers registered.
Thanks,
