you're right, it's not necessary anymore. (New patch below)

Those lines come from 2.4.29's drivers/char/serial.c (>= line 1686). I
left in the last "else" to have some fallback if uart_get_baud_rate()
would change its behaviour to something else (i.e. does allow baud to
be larger than max_baud). However this would lead to an incorrect baud
rate to be set anyway (as the maximum baud rate of 16C950 is uartclk/4),
so one could simply set the "/4" mode for everything larger than uartclk/8.
Btw, if you look at lines 1700-1701 of original 2.6.13's 8250.c:
    baud = uart_get_baud_rate(port, termios, old, 0, port->uartclk/16);
    quot = serial8250_get_divisor(port, baud);
baud is limited to uartclk/16 here, but serial8250_get_divisor() tests
it for being uartclk/4 or uartclk/8...
I'm afraid that max_baud thing has to become somewhat more general, or
do I miss something?
Hmm and I don't get the point in the calculation of "quot" - is that
formula correct in every case? I'll look into that a little bit now.
