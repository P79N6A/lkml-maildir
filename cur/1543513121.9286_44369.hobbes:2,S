After compiling and rebooting, I get the following:
Starting system loggers: Kernel BUG at sched.c:573!
invalid operand: 0000
CPU: 0
EIP: 0010:[<c01105e15>]
EFLAGS: 00010286
[skipped registers since I had to copy it by hand]
Process S30syslog (pid: 128, stackpage=c05ad000)
System works fine with 2.3.21
AMD K6-2/450
w/
gcc 2.95.1
bunutils 2.9.5
syslog 1.3-3
If you'd like the register dump, ask and I'll reboot and copy it for you.
