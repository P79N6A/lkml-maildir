ugh, and here I said I wouldn't respond.  But to be fair, he wrote me
this before I said that...

No, I'm saying that devfs does solve this problem.  Quite well in fact.

But devfs never used the dynamic major/minor code.  No one used it.
It's not even present anymore in 2.6.  That shows that devfs does not
solve this problem by itself.

It isn't.  It's saying that devfs does do this.

Heh, you haven't ever converted a driver to use devfs have you?  If so,
you would have seen the fact that you had to specify your devfs name in
the driver interface.  That's hard coding the naming scheme in the
kernel.
And how flexible does devfsd allow you to specify your own naming
scheme?  How can you get the info from devfsd that you need to provide a
proper device name?  No one I know has ever does this.  And I know some
people who tried real hard...

But it doesn't.  That was the point.
udev defaults to this.  Which is the sane thing to do.
