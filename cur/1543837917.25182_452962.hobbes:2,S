OK strike that.  The aic94xx cards all have IDs like 9005:04XX
There does seem to be a cockup in the initialisation tables, but I can't
see how it could affect what you're seeing. (PCI_DEVICE() uses the .name
= value initialisation method and the fields following are unnamed).  Do
you build both of these into the kernel, and if so does it work when
they're both modular?
