I've used 2.4.10-ac12 with a D-Link DFE570TX NIC (quad DECchip 21143
tulip) without any problems. Maybe the tulipdriver in -ac is somewhat
diffrent.

My cards are also DS21143 Tulip rev 65, they are located behind a DECchip
21152 pci-pci bridge but I don't think it matters.
(it's Intel who produces the chips these days but I don't think they have
changed the design)
I've used the vanilla driver in 2.4.10-ac12 and the tulip-ss010402-poll
and tulip-NAPI-011015 drivers and they all work fine with my NIC.

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
