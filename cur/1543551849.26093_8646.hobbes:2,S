I wrote a lightweight kernel->userland ring buffer device for Linux
called bufflink and a block-request logger that uses it called
reqlog. reqlog writes a structure
    struct reqlog {
	    unsigned int    major;
	    unsigned int    minor;
	    unsigned long   sector;
	    long            nr_sectors;
    };
to the ring buffer when an ioctl is done to enable logging. The
current patch isn't quite what you were suggesting since it does
roughly
     add_request() {
	...
	elevator_queue(req, tmp, latency, dev, current_request);
    +   if (bl_reqlog && enable_reqlog) {
    +       ...
    +       bufflink_append(bl_reqlog, (unsigned char *)&rl, sizeof rl);
    +   }
	if (queue_new_request)
		(dev->request_fn)();
     }
but it would be easy to write the record (instead or as well)
before the elevator_queue(). The patches are available from
