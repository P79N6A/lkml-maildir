Nathan's had a second oops that turned out to be a bi_next pointer
being bad in a bio that raid5 had just about finished writing out.
So there does seem to be something wrong with bio handling, quite
possibly in raid5.
The only thing I could find was that if raid5 received two overlapping
bios concurrently (or atleast received the second before it had
finished with the first) it could get confused.  I've asked Nathan to
try a patch that BUGs when that happens.
