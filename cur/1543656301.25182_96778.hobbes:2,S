It does *NOT* slow down your box if kernel cannot parse
CPIUD cache size info. Cache does not need any help from kernel to function.
It is typically enabled by BIOS at boot, that's all.
If you can prove otherwise (that is, your cache is disabled),
that is a problem. Problem in BIOS.
Cache size *reporting* is a minor issue. You can track it yourself.
You have the code, right?
