Hello,
      We have a requirement to implement the sleep and wakeup mechanism
at microsecond boundary in 2.4 kernel. The intent of this mail is to
start a discussion on this topic and collect inputs from the kernel
developers. Any reply on the issues of implementing such a feature will
be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Kallol Biswas
