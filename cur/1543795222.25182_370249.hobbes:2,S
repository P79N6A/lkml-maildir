Subject: [PATCH 0/7]: Fix for unsafe notifier chain
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/23/462

Andrew,
I posted this set of patch to lkml last Friday as an RFC. Can you
consider these for -mm inclusion.
These patches apply on 2.6.15-rc2.
Thanks,
chandra
Here are the details:
In 2.6.14, notifier chains are unsafe. notifier_call_chain() walks through
the list of a call chain without any protection.
Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu> brought the issue and suggested a fix
in lkml on Oct 24 2005:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113018709002036&w=2
There was a lot of discussion on that thread regarding the issue, and
following were the conclusions about the requirements of the notifier
call mechanism:
	- The chain list has to be protected in all the places where the
	  list is accessed.
	- We need a new notifier_head data structure to encompass the head 
	  of the notifier chain and a semaphore that protects the list.
	- There should be two types of call chains: one that is called in 
	  a process context and another that is called in atomic/interrupt
	  context.
	- No lock should be acquired in notifier_call_chain() for an
	  atomic-type chain.
	- notifier_chain_register() and notifier_chain_unregister() should
	  be called only from process context.
	- notifier_chain_unregister() should _not_ be called from a
	  callout routine.
I posted an RFC that meets the above listed requirements last Friday:
	- http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113175279131346&w=2
Paul McKenney provided some suggestions w.r.t RCU usage. This patchset fixes
the issues he raised.  Keith Owens posted some changes to the diechain for
various architectures; his changes are included here.
This is posted as an RFC as we want to get a green signal from the owners of
the files that our classification of chains as ATOMIC or BLOCKING is ok.
Please comment.
This patchset has 7 patches:
1 of 7: Changes the definition of the heads. Same as what was posted last
	Friday with changes w.r.t Paul's comments.
2 of 7:	Changes that affected only the notifier_head definition.
3 of 7: Changes in which we removed some protection (it's no longer needed
	as the basic infrastructure itself provides the protection).
4 of 7: changes for diechain for different architectures.
5 of 7: changes removing calls to notifier_unregister in the callout.
6 of 7: changes to dcdbas.c (requires special handling).
7 of 7: changes to make usb_notify to use the notify chain infrastructure
	instead of its own.
