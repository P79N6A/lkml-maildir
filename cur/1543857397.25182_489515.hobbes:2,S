Mmm CPU 0 in 1m 32s, but I was running things like ps and taskset in 
another terminal to verify affinity, CPU 1 still hadn't finished in 40m 
when I killed it. I've downloaded the LFDK mentioned in the other post 
and will post the results when I have them.
Thanks for replying,
This is the script I'm using to time decompression
nas:~# cat ./cputest.sh
date
taskset -c 1 nice -n -8 tar -xjf /root/linux-2.6.18.1.tar.bz2
date
uname -a
rm -r /root/linux-2.6.18.1/
nas:~#
both the tar and bzip2 processes have their affinity and priority set by 
the above command.
