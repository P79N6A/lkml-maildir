Just checked the problem with 2.4-test2 : the
problem still exists.
Can someone confirm this is a kernel bug ?
(or ifconfig bug perhaps?)
reminder :
- ifconfig dummy0 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
- ping works ok
- ifconfig dummy0 down
- ping still works ! (that's the supposed bug)
- rmmod dummy0
- ping doesn't work anymore (that's ok)
Best regards,
