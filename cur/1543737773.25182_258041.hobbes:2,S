True. But 2.5 I think really is too low (for anyone, except maybe a
CPU with no/a tiny L2 cache).

Yeah.. 10ms may bring up idle times a bit on other workloads. Judith
had some database tests that were very sensitive to this - if 10ms is
OK there, then I'd say it would be OK for most things.

Heh. I think it would be good to have a automatic thingy to tune it.
A smarter cache_decay_ticks calculation would suit.
