Well we definitely need a way to timeout keys.  The other reason is to be
able to "change your mind" about it while the key is being used.  This may
not be a useful thing for now but think of encrypted swaps on the
infamous: oopsies-i-tripped-over-a-wire-and-disconnected-network-file-system
Here we have a situation where we want to not have an expired key with
valid data hanging out there.
Or are we saying that expiration only affects encryption and that the
decryption counterpart sticks around until its reference count goes to
zero? On the surface this seems to be easier, although not sure if it
makes us miss any situation.
Cheers,
Ahmed.
