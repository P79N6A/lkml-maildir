Well, at that point it does not know whether or not you
occasionally plug in an ipod or a digital camera.
Going back from the lsmod output to all the right CONFIG
options is also not as trivial as it sounds, due to all
the dependencies there are.
This project sounds like it could be a great undergraduate
project, maybe built on top of Ketchup to automatically
fetch, configure, compile and install a working kernel :)
Are there any volunteers to write down the project
description on the kernelnewbies.org wiki?
