So I do. What does your arch/i386/Makefile looks like? What
compiler options are used for compiling the source code modules?

Deleting the -march=i686 option in arch/i386/Makefile makes
it. Also the message "Can't find linux/errno.h" disappeared.

This problem remains.

It's a compiler option in arch/i386/Makefile of the source tree 
of the developer kernel I downloaded from kernel.org.
I cannot see any dependency to SuSE or to a newer version of egcs.
