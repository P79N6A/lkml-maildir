ftr, as a by-stander, I perceived the past discussions as a lack of
trust from other kernel developers that Ndiswrapper will always set
the taint flags correctly. (ndiswrapper code does not go through lkml
review so the magic line might just change between tarballs.)

I think the global taint flag is always needed because you never know
what the proprietary module actually did to our memory. Unloading
the driver and ndiswrapper should retain some sort of taintedness
should it oops much later.
