<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Linux Community,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>I've seen discussion of shared sync objects for 
SMP (reader/writer locks) from some folks.&nbsp; I have not seen anything out 
there for them in the kernel sources.&nbsp; We really need this in Linux.&nbsp; 
In particular, they would make file systems ***SMOKE*** from a performance 
standpoint.&nbsp; Comms (neworking) subsystems usually are ok with simple 
mutexes and spin locks, but file systems and databases are different 
beasts.&nbsp; I've implemented them in two different SMP kernels.&nbsp; It 
sounds like several folks are working on implementations of them.&nbsp; I'd like 
to see them get rolled into the kernel -- they are desperately 
needed.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Standards are good.&nbsp; the UI (Unix 
International) APIs are some of the better for defining SMP synchronization 
objects (mutex_lock, mutex_unlock, rd_rwlock, etc.)&nbsp; becuase they are 
standardized, easy to implement, and well known.&nbsp; They also can be 
implemented in-kernel.&nbsp; If someone else doesn't take stab at putting them 
in, we may try to, if folks think they would be a good idea.&nbsp; We really 
need a shared sync object in the kernel for file system work (shared FATs, Dir 
Tables, etc.) they increase SMP parallelism and scaling if implemented correctly 
very significantly.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>If other folks are interested in this, we could 
take a shot at putting them in, but we aren't religious about it, and would 
certainly welcome other folks to try as well -- it will help all of 
us.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Please advise.</FONT></DIV>
