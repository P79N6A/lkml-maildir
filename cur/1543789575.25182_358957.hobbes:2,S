   Nope, it still gives me memory above 4GB.  If I change goal to 0x0 it
works.  One nit, shouldn't IS_LOW_AGES() be more like this:
#define IS_LOWPAGES(paddr, size) ((paddr+size-1) < 0x100000000UL)
Minor optimization not checking the start, but a 64MB swiotlb starting
at 4GB-64MB should be found as ok.  Thanks,
	Alex
