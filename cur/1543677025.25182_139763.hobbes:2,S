This got dragged into private mail for a few messages, but we figured
out the problem turns into scheduling fairness with wake_up_nr()
32 procs might get woken, but when the first of those procs gets a
request, he'll wake another, and so on.  But there's no promise that
getting woken fairly means you'll get scheduled fairly, so you might not
get scheduled in for quite a while, perhaps even after new requests have
gone onto the wait queue and gotten woken up.
The real problem is get_request_wait_wakeup, andrea is working on a few
changes to that.
