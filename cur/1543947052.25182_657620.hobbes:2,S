That's a nice intent, but the reality is that this code is broken as
hell:
1) the patching code runs without synchronizing other CPUs
2) it inserts NOPs even if there is no clock source which provides
vread
3) when the clock source changes to one without vread we run in
exactly the same problem as in #2
4) if nobody toggles the proc entry from 1 to 0 and to 1 again, then
the syscall is not patched out contrary to your claim.
