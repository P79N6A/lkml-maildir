Hi Linus.

And since the NMI return will need a
ESP fixup too, it will require the
"branched" version of the restore_all
checks I suppose.

I haven't said that explicitly, only
implied:) My another idea was to adjust
the tss.esp0 to always point 8 bytes below
the real top of the stack, so that even in
case of an NMI we are still safe. And in
case of another such instance - too.
This may look more like a hack than shifting
the "sti", but it is probably more reliable.
At least something to consider as soon as we
are at it.
