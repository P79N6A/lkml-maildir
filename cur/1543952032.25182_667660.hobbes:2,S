Yes, I considered that.  Alternatively additions to a parent cgroup's
.deny could be propagated to all its descendents (but not additions to
the .allow).
I've noted this as something to add to the next version.

To prevent it escaping to laxer device permissions, which of course only
makes sense if we do what you recommend above :)

Yeah it should be renamed.  I want to use the same cap which we would
use for user namespaces though.  CAP_NS_CONT(ainer)?  Even though there
really is no such thing as a 'container'.  But that would tie together
any such privileges for cgroups and namespaces.
