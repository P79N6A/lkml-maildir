Read the document linked to by Jean. It explains why a volatile API is 
ultimately beneficial to the Linux development process.
It's frustrating for vendors and maintainers to keep their code up to date 
with the latest kernel, but if it's done incrementally after Linus releases 
(or during the very lengthy RC process), it's usually very easy.
Also, you're gelling together many projects which have completely different 
reasons for breaking across kernel revisions.
ipw2200 "works" in 2.6.14, it's just the maintainer has opted to use a "stable 
version" which lacks experimental features while ieee80211 gets up to 
scratch.
OTOH, unionfs is poorly maintained and is a particularly sore example of how 
the linux development model is detrimental to external module development.
There are people constantly working to make binary modules like VMWare, NVIDIA 
and ATI work under the newest kernels. Just google it. Ultimately we can't 
allow ourselves to be held down by slow-moving binary vendors. It's too 
inefficient (not to mention of questionable ethics).
