This looks exactly like the error I got from my ST39173LC drives when
I was using a bad SCA to Ultra2 converter. I switched to a real SCA
tray with backplane and now they work like a charm with the aic7xxx
driver under 2.2.1[2-4]. Rock solid and fast [1].
So this _could_ also be a bad cabling / termination problem.
