I used a dedicated disk for this task. No one else besides the task is writing 
to it!

All tests were performed on empty disk!

I have a flash disk from a manufacturer who grants me 48 MB/s. And FreeBSD as 
well as Windows reach this value. Only Linux 2.6.18 is far away from it (42 
MB/s)

What I have to build is an application for the International Space Station 
ISS. I am limited with power and space. So If the disk is able to write 
constantly 48 MB/s then the Operating System should do this!

Power consumption! See above.

The problem is: FreeBSD is fast, but lacks of some special drivers. Linux has 
all drivers but access to harddisk is unpredictable and thus unreliable!
What can I do??
