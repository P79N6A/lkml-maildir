Ok, so if the majority of you is running 2.3.x with 8mbyte machine I was
wrong in my mbyte statistics and I'll continue to hand tune my own kernel
for my own 128mbyte machine until the autotuning feature will be merged
(as I am in the _minority_ running 2.3.x with >=32mbyte ram).
NOTE: if you want me working actively on the hash-autotune feature I am
not too busy and I can write a common interface.
