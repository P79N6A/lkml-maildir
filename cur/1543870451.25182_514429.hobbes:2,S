Given that glibc already implements fallocate for all filesystems, it will
need to continue to do so for filesystems which don't implement this
syscall - otherwise applications would start breaking.
However with this kernel change, glibc will need to look at the errno,
so that it can correctly propagate EIO, ENOSPC and whatever.  So we will
need to return a reliable and stable and sensible value so that glibc knows
when it should emulate and when it should propagate.
Perhaps Ulrich can comment.
