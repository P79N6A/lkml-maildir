here's what the files in my Maildir spool look like in vim (my vim displays a '»'

notice that there are two spaces instead of 1. Also there's no line heading the
diff with 'diff a/foo b/foo' which is what throws of stg. And the -p option is
missing.
as for content, the patch looks OK with me. I ran the numbers and allthough there
was a slight average delay in the link up detection time it is negligeable (less
than 0.2sec difference over a bunch of measurements), and I confirmed your
powertop numbers are correct. As for the timer interval, the watchdog may already
be delayed up to 3 seconds safely, this doesn't change that.
I'll forward the patch, Care to make one for e100? plenty of laptops with those
still around! The embedded guys would love it I think.
Thanks,
Auke
