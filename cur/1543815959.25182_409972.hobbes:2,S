Well, that's plausible. We probably don't need IDE *and* SCSI faking. 
We'd like to at least keep SCSI faking, perhaps making it more 
attractive by going to some effort to take at least the essential SCSI 
ioctls. We've talked about reving our block protocol to encapsulate 
SCSI anyway -- this would be another step on that path.
If we stick to just our own major then we break distro init scripts and 
surprise users.
