Hi all;
I had a script in 2.0.35 which backed up to tape with a 10240 byte block
size
using dd. Under 2.2.2, this does not work. Now, if I set the tape block
size
to 512, the following works:
tar -cvf - /etc | dd of=/dev/tape bs=10240 (??)
With the tape block size set to 10240, I get
dd: Input/output error
Now in the new st.c I did see some mention as to writes having to be a
multiple of the block size but this behavior is puzzling me.
I need to have this work so I can move tapes between Linux and HP
systems which need to see the 10240 block size. I got it the backup
to run but haven't tried to actually read the tape.
Any ideas?
