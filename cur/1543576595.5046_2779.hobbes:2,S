never seen this before.
I run 2.2.19pre3 on a BP6.  No OC, no vmware. just the kernel wilt
lm-sensors stuff patched in.
I found that the kernel was somewhat sluggish now and then, and
this morning, this popped up in the logs :
Dec 24 02:05:05 grobbebol kernel: probable hardware bug: clock timer
configuration lost - probably a VIA686a.
Dec 24 02:05:05 grobbebol kernel: probable hardware bug: restoring chip
configuration.
which is weird I guess.
