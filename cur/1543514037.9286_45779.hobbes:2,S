well, I can't see how it may have bounced back out of
the bios, since the bios is only entered with a cpu
reset. Most of the CPU's context is lost by the reset,
including IDT and GDT, and I don't imagine the kernel
being able to display an "oops" on the console under
these conditions.
What is possible however, is that the reset doesn't
work and causes the oops. And perhaps in this case it
may overlap memory.
