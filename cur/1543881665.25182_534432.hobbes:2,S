That's what the DAC interfaces were for, but people wanted to
remoe that since no in-tree users existed.
Devices like that want to essentially map the entire address space,
via pass-thru, not IOMMU mappings.
Clustering cards, such as those made by Dolphin, are another example.
I realize that this doesn't work when we absolutely must use an IOMMU
such as for virtualization which is the whole impetus of the Intel
IOMMU. :-)

Perhaps, but as I said heuristics might not be enough here.
