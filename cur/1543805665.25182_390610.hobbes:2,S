Wouldn't it be better to just put that information into the cpuinfo_x86?
We're having too many per CPU arrays already.

This needs a comment on what a LLC actually is.

Dito.

This could be __cpuinitdata, no?
Actually it would be better to pass this information in some other way
to smpboot.c than to add more and more arrays like this.  It's only
needed for the current CPU, because for the others the information
is in cpu_llc_shared_map
Perhaps SMP boot up should pass around a pointer to temporary data like this?
Or discover it in smpboot.c with a function call?

elif? What happens where there are both shared caches and SMT?
