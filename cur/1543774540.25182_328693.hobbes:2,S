That's rather awkward, and will be painful in certain applications
that are trying to scan multiple filesystems, possibly run by
different users X, Y, and Z.

No, I'm saying that it should be both per-mountpoint and per-process.
Hence something like fnctl.  Problem is though fnctl() works on a file
descriptor, and with FUSE running you wouldn't be able to even get a
file descriptor opened on the mountpoint.

Globally remounting the filesystem allow_other isn't the right thing,
since applications that don't know what to expect will be taken by
surprise.  Hence my suggestion to do something which is both
per-mountpoint and per-process.
