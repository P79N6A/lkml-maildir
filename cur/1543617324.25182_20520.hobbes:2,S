You probably have IBM drives that say they are SCSI-2 yet can do
160 speeds.  There is a check in the driver that prevents it from
negotiating from SCSI-2 drives so as to not blow up on SCSI-2 devices
that don't support the new negotiation message type.  I have a fix
to work around IBM's mistake in the next driver release.
