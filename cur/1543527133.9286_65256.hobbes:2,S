Horst,
I dropped by Caldera yesterday, and I had gotten a drop of their early
2.3 with the WRONG modversions.h file used to build the kernel and
modules -- even some of their internal drivers would not even load with
it until I had rebuilt them from the SRPMS source files.  The later
build of the Caldera 2.3 eServer was fine, and everything seems to work
great (except they forgot to put the gcc RPMS on the install CD
(??????).  kmalloc() not being exported was a dead giveaway something
was seriously busted.
