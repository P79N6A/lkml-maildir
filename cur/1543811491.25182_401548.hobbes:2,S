I got that already, no need to shout. I just wanted to point
out that from the information you provided so far it
looks like your problem could be fixed in a more straight
forward fashion.
Problem:  Boot firmware passes invalid arguments.
Solution: Ignore invalid boot firmware arguments.

If you use a distribution kernel which contains one, you
could simply add "noinitrd" to the kernel command line
to ignore it, no?

I don't understand your aggressiveness, there must be a dark
secret behind all this. Or maybe it's just the season
for flame wars.
I'm sorry to have bothered you,
