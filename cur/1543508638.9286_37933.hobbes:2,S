Hello folks,
	I want to experiment with implementing different network
protocols. So far I've used the existing ARP implementation and have added
on stuff to the send and receive functions for my experimentation. The
problem with this approach is that it is bloody slow to fiddle with the
kernel code, recompile, reboot and test. I was hoping to be able to speed
up this process by using modules. I know something about overriding
sys_calls, but what I want to do is override the arp send and receive
functions. What I was envisioning is having the "original" ARP code
running, then insmod my updated module that would override the "original"
ARP code. After the experiment is complete, rmmod my ARP code module and
have the original ARP code resume. Is this feasible? If so, can someone
give me some pointers on how to get started?
Or, would I have to modularize the "original" code up front and have an
"original" module and my updated module that I would have to swap in and
out? If this is the case, could someone help me get started here too?
I'm rather a newbie to kernel hacking... so be gentle.
I have looked rather hard at the mailing lists and other sources and
couldn't really find anything directly relevant. If this is a FAQ, please
just point me to the relevant sources.
TIA
