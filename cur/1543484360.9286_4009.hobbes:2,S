You managed to confuse ksymoops quite a bit. Seems that it wasnt able to
read the modules symbol information - of course not, the module wasn't
properly loaded at that time, it crashed insmod while loading. Maybe
produce a symbol map for the module, by using insmod -m ? This together
with the call trace from the actual oops might help..
Gruss,
