The last sentence I agree---it is really not a big deal.  But if
the thing is rarely changed, more likely people would forget to
update one when changing the other, wouldn't they?
In any case, either the dontdiff and mrproper are maintained
separately or not, I am in favor of having dontdiff in the
kernel tree.
