10ths of a second if there is a lot to let run instead of this thread. Even
1/100th is bad news.

They dont flood the bus with interrupts, the lock the bus off for several

IDE with or without Andre's changes can insert multiple millisecond delays
on the bus in some situations. Again pre-empt patch can offer you nothing 
because the hardware limit is easily met by low latency

Network packets get submitted from _outside_
