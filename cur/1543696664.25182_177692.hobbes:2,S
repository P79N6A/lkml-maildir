I like k3b and other kde tools dealing with CDs and they require the use
of ide-scsi at least as far as I know (I tried to use cdrecord 2 without
ide-scsi with k3b but without success). I use k3b because I sometimes use
an external usb cd-recorder. However it is currently not connected to the
system.
