notwithstanding any previous issues we've had I've found our via k8t800 
chipset mainboards (amd64 cpus) to be very stable. the one we use for 
desktop machines is the msi kt8 neo fisr and we been very happy with the 
hardware support in modern distros for these boards.

Both supermicro and tyan do fairly extensive testing of their server and 
workstation product lines with linux. If you think there's a lot of dual 
itanium II's and 4-way opterons out there running windows you'd be wrong. 
They both make boards that ought to be pretty attractive to building 
single cpu desktops boxes such as the supermicro p4sct+II (intel 875p) or 
the tyan Tiger K8WS (amd chipset)

I'd look at the msi 875P NEO-FIS2R for p4, the K8T_Neo-FIS2R for athlon64 
and the tyan thunder K8W or ws for an opteron solution. given how cheap 
pci ethernets are you shouldn't be concerned about that most workstation 
boards don't come with two.
