Hi Keith!
	Yes, this was my original intention, but the more I thought
about it, the more I wondered if it was worth it.  In fact, my patch
adds CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD, because most people don't actually need it,
and I don't really care if most modules are not unloadable.  Loading
modules makes sense.  Unloading them is pretty much an optimization.
	The reason I eventually decided to split initialization in
this version anyway, was that so many drivers get it wrong!  Things
like registering interrupt handlers before they have set up their
internal state, etc.  Splitting it into two functions is merely a
mechanism to get them to think about things a little harder 8)
	  And honestly, I got distracted by the PARAM stuff 8)
Cheers!
Rusty.
