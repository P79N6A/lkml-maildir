Transaction is a sequence of file system modifications that (by the
virtue of file system implementation) is bound to either be completed as
a whole or be aborted as a whole (this is called "atomicity").
Commit is a certain operation performed during transaction life-time to
implement its atomicity.

Take a look at the "commit" mount option of reiserfs.
