That's the big question. On openSUSE 10.2, all the md devices get created
automatically. I suppose that happens as part of udev processing all the
queued kernel events at bootup.
On default FC6 install (i.e. without any raid), only /dev/md0 is present
(like in Aurora). That alone, and that you got md1 there, and I don't, is
strange.
I think I found it. udev does not do md at all, for some reason.
This line in /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit is quite "offending":
[ -x /sbin/nash ] && echo "raidautorun /dev/md0" | nash --quiet
Starting a init=/bin/bash prompt and doing "/usr/sbin/udevmonitor &" 
there reveals:
bash-3.1# echo raidautorun /dev/md0 | /sbin/nash --quiet
UEVENT[1169934663.372139] add@/block/md0
bash-3.1# echo raidautorun /dev/md1 | /sbin/nash --quiet
UEVENT[1169934667.601027] add@/block/md1
No sign of md1. (Wtf here!) I can see why it's broken, but to nash every 
md device sounds like the worst solution around. I'd say the Fedora boot 
process is severely broken wrt. md. Well, what's your rc.sysinit looking 
like, since you seem to be having a md1 floating around?
