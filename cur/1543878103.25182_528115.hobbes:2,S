thanks - this is useful to those who are not that much on the bleeding 
edge.

it's harmless: when the 'patch' utility didnt find the 'context' of the 
patch chunk at its claimed position (because all patch chunks have 
precise coordinates of source code embedded), but finds them 'nearby' 
(or at least, somewhere in the file), it emits this reminder that the 
underlying code did change since the patch was generated. Generating a 
'clean' patch will get rid of these messages.
