heh ;) You, you ... nitpicking extremist! ;)
And beware that you just commited another act of extremism too:
> I agree there.
because you just went to the extreme position of saying that "i agree 
with this portion 100%", instead of saying "this seems to be 91.5% 
correct in my opinion, Tue, 17 Apr 2007 09:40:25 +0200".
and the nasty thing is, that in reality even shades of grey, if you 
print them out, are just a set of extreme black dots on an extreme white 
sheet of paper! ;)
[ so i guess we've got to consider the scope of extremism too: the 
  larger the scope, the more limiting and hence the more dangerous it
  is. ]
