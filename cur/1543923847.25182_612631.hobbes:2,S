The problem with that is that once a slab was allocated with the right
allocation context, anybody can get objects from these slabs.
low memory, and empty slab:
task A                        task B
kmem_cache_alloc() = NULL
                              current->flags |= PF_MEMALLOC
                              kmem_cache_alloc() = obj
                              (slab != NULL)
kmem_cache_alloc() = obj
kmem_cache_alloc() = obj
kmem_cache_alloc() = obj
And now task A, who doesn't have the right permissions walks
away with all our reserve memory.
So we either reserve a page per object, which for 32 byte objects is a
large waste, or we stop anybody who doesn't have the right permissions
from obtaining objects. I took the latter approach.
