Hi all, hi Gerhard, hi Jes,
this was my first time I submitted a reasonable patch to linux-kernel.
Why are you discussing it that way ?  I just made the boot-logo
_optional_ ...
It's not my intention to remove functionality nor do I claim that this
patch is a solution for my problem.  I just wanted finer control about
what goes in _my_ kernel or not.
The patch was ugly and sub-optimal. At the bottom of my original
announcment you'll find my remark that I would like to clean up the
whole fbcon code.
cheers,
Patrick
