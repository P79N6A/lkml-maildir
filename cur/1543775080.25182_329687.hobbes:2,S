The bad news: it was impossible (or at least very hard to do).
The good news: it is possible now. The anwser is:
- figure where the partitions are (possibly using some simple script),
- use device-mapper to create block devices covering partitions,
- mount them.
I do not know if this anwser will win your price but it is IMHO far better 
than hexedit... :-) And probably this is the only anwser.
(IIRC if you have one partition you can skip partition table with offset 
option to losetup. But this will only work in this special case...)
