First, this looks like ix86 stuff, not m68k. Drivers for ix86
machines probe the de facto addresses for up to a maximum of
4 8250-type UARTS. Those addresses are:
(0)	0x3f8
(1)	0x2f8
(2)	0x3e8
(3)	0x328
(from the Phoenix SYSTEM BIOS book)
Usually, there are several bits that are permanently 0 in
some of the registers. This is used to "positively" identify
the chip. Note that many IR devices are also connected
to 8250-type UARTS.
I would guess that you have two serial ports, plus another
UART that's used for IR (maybe a IR keyboard???).
You can do `od /dev/ttyS2` from the root account and see
what happends.
