Hi folks,
Today I have installed the new kernel 2.2.13. It seems that the 
setup of an ISDN connection (sync. PPP) has become unreliable. After 
booting I have to stop and restart the ISDN startup script several 
times till I can reach the foreign gateway. Once the connection is 
established there are no problems.
Before 2.2.13 I had a prerelease kernel (2.2.13pre14) installed,
which did not show such a problem. Do you have any ideas? 
Regards
Harri
