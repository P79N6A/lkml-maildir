People sometimes use the term "operating system design" to mean the
design of kernels.  However, for decades, when I've heard people talk
about operating systems such as Unix, Multics, ITS, VMS, OS/360, or
even Microsoft Windows, they generally did meant the whole collection
of software, not just the kernel.
