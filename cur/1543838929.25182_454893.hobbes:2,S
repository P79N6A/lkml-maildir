I'm not sure it's a good idea, it might have other implications in
slab.c. I better fix kmemleak (I think currently you could get a
deadlock only on SMP).

I haven't looked at these patches in detail but they look like making
the slab allocator cleaner.
Anyway, I still need to revisit the locking in kmemleak and not rely
on future changes to slab.c. At the moment I think I can avoid any
kmemleak locks when allocating memory (by using radix_tree_preload
with the radix trees). If this still fails, I'll think about writing
my own, very simple, memory allocator and avoid the re-entrance
problem.
Thanks.
