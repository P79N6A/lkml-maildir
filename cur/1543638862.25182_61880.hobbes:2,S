I think you get intreface resets. I had such a problem with a 3c575CB (same
driver), connected to a defective chipset. I couldn't send high traffic
rates, but could receive. There is a watchdog timeout that you can reconfigure
in the 3c59x driver (I don't remember its name, use modinfo). If you reduce
the timeout, you should see reduced drifting in the pings. I used 300ms I
think. But IMHO, that's definitely not a timing problem. Perhaps in your
case, it's simply a half/full duplex misconfiguration.
