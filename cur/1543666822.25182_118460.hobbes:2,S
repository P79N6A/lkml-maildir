I forgot to explain why in the subject i've written hard disk too..
When, at the boot, every 27 times, it check the file system, some times
(or every time, i don't sure..) it fails... :-( I use ext3.
Ps. i've tried 2.4.18 and 2.4.20 kernels.. i'd like to know if my
problems are solved with the 2.5.* kernel
