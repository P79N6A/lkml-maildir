I'm just thinking of two options for default inheritance on a non-cap
file:  
- inherit everything from parent process (compatible; root login must get
all pI set)
- inherit nothing from parent process (paranoid, takes work to set fI on
all needed files)

No, I think on login root should have all pI set, and root magic should be
removed from the kernel.

OK, so you're wanting to add a mechanism whereby certain users _never_ get
a certain cap, irrespective of fP and fI.  I just don't see wide
application for this; if you can give me some good concrete examples, that
would help.  Off hand, though, I think it would be most appropriate to
control this in the filesystem as currently.  I.e., CAP_X is obviously
dangerous in the wrong hands; so most files w/ CAP_X in fP should be in
some group to which only certain users belong, and world execute bit
should be removed.

I don't understand this part; I would think just leave CAP_X out of fP and
fI.

Again, I'd be interested in real-world examples of this.
It seems like, in light of what I'm asking for, a better explanation of my
fM proposal would be in order.  So far, it seems like we've pretty much
agreed that the 'shell' of an admin will have a pretty full pI.  Now,
let's say this admin uses some random mail reader to read his/her mail.
The mail program has: fP=0, fI=0, fE=0; since all it needs are file
rights.  So obviously pP for the mail prog is 0.  BUT, pI' = pI; so the
mail program _does_ have a full pI.  So somebody could send the admin a
message with a buffer overflow exploit, which could then exec something
with a bigger fI and do some damage.
The same also applies to admin starting named(8) by hand.  named(8) only
inherits, say CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE, but now has a full pI; so the named
exploit is now nearly as potent as before.  (assuming /bin/sh has a fairly
large inheritable set)
So basically what I'm saying is, I think it would be really useful to have
a simple mechanism for constraining the inheritable set of the exec'ed
process.  Even though it's pP is small, pI can still do a lot of damage.
cheers,
