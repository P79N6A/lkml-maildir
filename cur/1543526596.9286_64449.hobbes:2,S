One of the problems I had with eepro100 in 2.2 where I didn't have
problems in 2.0.x is that with 2.2 I started using IPv6 extensivly on my
network. The multicast traffic caused by IPv6 arp and router discovery
broke my systems with eepro100s, though I think the problem has been
worked around in newer 2.2 kernls.
