Yes, IrDA in the 2.4 kernels is broken. ;(

In the past, I've been sending my irda stuff (which is now a part of Dag's
patch) to Linus in small little chunks, but unfortunately it never got
accepted either for reason(s) unknown.  This was back in the -test1 days.
I, too, would also like to know what, if anything, is going to happen
with IrDA.  It'd be good to have IrDA working again.
