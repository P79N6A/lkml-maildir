Pierre,
my point is that after you've added interface "set IPCID", you'll need more and more for checkpointing:
- "create/setup conntrack" (otherwise connections get dropped),
- "set task start time" (needed for Oracle checkpointing BTW),
- "set some statistics counters (e.g. networking or taskstats)"
- "restore inotify"
and so on and so forth.
Exporting such intimate kernel interfaces to user space doesn't look sane.
Exactly from compatibility and maintenance POV. You'll be burden with supporting them for a long time.
Remember recent story with SLUB and /proc/slabinfo?
Hope I made my argument more clear this time.
Thanks,
Kirill
