This can happen if you get your __devinit and __devinitdata declarations
tangled up.  If you have a table which is declared __devinit instead of
__devinitdata then subsequently declared functions end up with their
text being placed in the rodata section.  You only find out about this
because the assembler pads .align statements with nulls.  Hard to find.
So if the modutils upgrade doesn't help, remove all `init' thingies and
see if the problem goes away.
