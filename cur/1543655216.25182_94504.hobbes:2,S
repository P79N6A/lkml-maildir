The patch I'm talking about introduces a distinction between the size
of an area mapped by a PTE or TLB entry (MMUPAGE_SIZE) and the kernel's
internal allocation unit (PAGE_SIZE), and does (AFAICT) properly
vectored PTE operations in the VM to support the system's native page
size, and does a whole kernel audit of drivers/ and fs/ PAGE_SIZE usage
so that the distinction between PAGE_SIZE and MMUPAGE_SIZE is understood.

PAGE_CACHE_SIZE is mostly an fs thing, so there's not much danger of
confusion, at least not in my mind.

Hmm, from the appearances of the patch (my ability to test the patch
is severely hampered by its age) it should actually maintain hardware
pagesize mmap() granularity, ABI compatibility, etc.

Sounds like the right timing for me.
A 16KB or 64KB kernel allocation unit would then annihilate
sizeof(mem_map) concerns on 3/1 splits. 720MB -> 180MB or 45MB.
Or on my home machine (768MB PC) 6MB -> 1.5MB or 384KB, which
is a substantial reduction in cache footprint and outright
memory footprint.
I think this is a perfect example of how the increased awareness of
space consumption highmem gives us helps us optimize all boxen.
Thanks,
Bill
