BSD is known for good network performance, however I don't know benchmarks. 
I think the difference is to big: The routing/IP stack combined being 10 times 
less efficient is too much.
They also don't mention which linux kernel they use. Reading the 
FreeBSD-5.3-Networking.pdf they did some optimasations which are probably not 
advisable if you don't use your box as a router.
The goal of this person is as far as I can see to build a router only, so in 
theory you could build in the same optimasations in network stack of linux
Also look at page 11: The fastforwarding is a solid positive step on how a 
router should work. So even the performance of FreeBSD is not considered like 
a real router OS.
