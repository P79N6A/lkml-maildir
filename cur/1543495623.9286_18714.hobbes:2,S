Subject: ugly crash with 2.2.8 UP

Linux 2.2.8 UP with vmware's loaded modules (build 152).
First I realized that I cannot exit from appications (even with sending
kill signal did not help).
CPU was almost total idle, but load avg reached 17.
Then I used alt-sysreq-i to kill process, but LOTS of processes remains
in D state (top reports DW, SW, Z states at the 'STAT' field).
After this I CAN'T use alt-sysreq kombos because they didn't do ANYTHING.
I was typing to help when apruptly the system freezes totally and
I must press my reset key which is VERY rare with Linux in general :)
I made copy from /dev/vcs5 where top ran but after the fsck the file was
not existed :(
Sorry for the incomplete report but I hope it can be usefull ...
PS : Can this bug casued by vmware and its modules or it IS a kernel bug ?
(btw : vmware installed 2.2.5 vm* modules because it said that they worked)
