So I merged the 23 of these which survived review and which do not
intersect with other outstanding work.
I don't think I have an opinion on whether the change is actually an
improvement, and I don't get a clear sense of what others think.  Shrug.
If we're going to make this change, we should ensure that it is done
kernel-wide, for UI consistency reasons.
If nothing else happens, I guess I'll spray these patches at the relevant
maintainers in a couple of weeks time, see what sticks.
