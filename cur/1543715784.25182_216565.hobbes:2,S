I've done tests using dd to and from the raw block device under 2.4 and 
2.6.  Memory size (kernel boot param mem=) doesn't seem to affect 
performance, so I assume that means that dd to and from the raw block 
device is unbuffered.  When I compare read and write speeds between 2.4 
and 2.6, 2.6 is definately slower.  The last 2.6 kernel I tried this 
with is 2.6.5.
