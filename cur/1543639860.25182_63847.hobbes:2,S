Right, accepted. But if it's good for P4, and bad for P3 (at least for some 
workloads), surely this leads to the conclusion that it should be a config 
option (probably defaulting to being on)? If you can see another way to
solve the conundrum ....
I can understand you didn't like the negative stuff, but there's a choice 
between two evils ... - some mess in the config.in file, and having a sensible
default. We will cut that one whichever way you like (though I can't help
thinking I'm missing some obvious default thing in the config language).
If you still hate it, the other option I can see is to cut a minimal patch for now, 
which institutes a CONFIG_IRQ_BALANCE, but just decides that off the existing
config options, rather than asking any more questions. Then we'll look at
the perf problems seperately, and see if we can fix them - people can force
it off by editing the .config file by hand if they want until then.
