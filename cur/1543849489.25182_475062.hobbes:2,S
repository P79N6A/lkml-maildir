5 is QH_STATE_COMPLETING.  That explains why the BUG() fires.
At this point it's beyond me.  Monty will have to take it from here.

Those messages are from the card reader.  It doesn't seem to be working 
right.  It returns the "end-of-data" error in response to a PREVENT MEDIUM 
REMOVAL command and it returns a phase error in response to a READ 
command.  In spite of the fact that it claims to have a 256 MB card 
present.
