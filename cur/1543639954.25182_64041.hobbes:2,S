I've had very similar (actually identical) problems with the ASUS A7V333
mobo. The mobo is completely VIA-based (both north and south) but the
southbridge seems to be much the same. What I did to make the machine run
stable was to - turn the USB2 support off (by hardware, a solder point on
the mobo) and short the solder point which is responsible for the CPU
functional settings data readout (the ROMSIP setting) to read the data from
a BIOS table instead of from the CPU itself. That seemed to have been enough
for me - now the mobo is stable (I'm gonna get rid of it, though...).
Another thing you might check is the CPU voltage - make sure it is the
standard 3.3 and not 3.5 as some manufacturers set it.
hope that helps a bit,
marek
