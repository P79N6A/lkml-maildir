As I said in another mail, I thought I won by running several busy loops
in parallel to the load, which prevented the system from either halting
or slowing down. But it was OK for a few minutes only and started going
mad again.

The machine was returned to the supplier and for other reasons, we switched
to a different maker for the about 20 machines (and all single-core). I've
read somewhere that there's already a second version of the sun x2100, I
don't know if it still exhibits the problem. Maybe at least they've fixed
the BIOS to report the HPET.

OK. I don't know if anyone there has one at hand, as I don't have it
anymore.
