Does it have a printer port like the Intel machines?
If so, set it up to generate interrupts on the 'event' pin
(paper-out, etc.) and have the ISR parrot the status bits
out the printer-port bits.
Start it  up and put function generator on the event bit.
measure the delay beteen that bin and the data data bit(s)
with a 'scope. This tells you the whole story, the total
time necessary for an ISR to actually do something.
