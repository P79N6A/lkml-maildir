It does. A clean build is not about esthetics but about quality. Warnings 
that are to be ignored hide warnings that are not to be, not just in the 
sense of the output but due to humans actively tuning out the noise after 
just a few. I'd hate for sound/isa to add to the noise.

This makes sense if someone told you that the deprecation period for 
exported symbols is one kernel cycle but who did?
Anyways, two things:
The number of out of tree users of these symbols is very close to zero and 
quite possibly if not likely _at_ zero after I've cleaned up the couple of 
half-hearted ALSA ISAPnP drivers that I keep in a few local branches here.
As such, and given that removing them apparently clears the path for a long 
overdue and welcome PnP cleanup, simply yanking them soon would get my ack.
Second, as said, speak to Jaroslav as well I guess.

Exactly, and serves as a perfect reminder of why noone should ever be 
allowed to deprecate anything until after removing all in tree users.
