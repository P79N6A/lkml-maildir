	Correct.  And it's one of the reasons why I chose the rt_mutex
	to back the pthread_mutex.   First we add robustness and
	then with the rt_mutex we get:
	1) priority queuing.   Tasks blocking on pthread_mutexes
	are queued in priority order, and the highest priority task is the 
first to be woken,
	with or without priority inheritance.
	2) priority inheritance, if so desired.
	3) With DEBUG_DEADLOCKS  on we get deadlock detection.
	I was hoping people would use the deadlock detection to
	fix incorrect apps, not file bugs against the kernel.
	The real difficulty lies with POSIX stating that a non-recursive
	mutex will hang if locked twice.  I would prefer to return
	-EWOULDDEADLOCK and not hang the app or the kernel,
	and we could in the case of robust mutexes, but POSIX
	priority inheriting mutexes could not, and be  POSIX compliant.
	It would be simple to detect a simple deadlock,  it's much more
	difficult to detect circular deadlocks, which is why I left it up
	to the rt_mutex's deadlock detect code.
	I understand the position that misbehaved apps should not
	be able to hang the kernel though.
	And this is where I ask two things:
	1) The really smart people helping with a brilliant solution.
	2) Anyone has a nice 4-way or 8-way for debugging purposes?
	
	I think I've pretty much exhausted UP debugging.
