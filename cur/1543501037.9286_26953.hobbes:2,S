I must be insane to be still tilting at this windmill, but I have to 
give this one last shot.  
File conglomerations (albods, whatevers) is a very promising
idea, but no matter how you approach it, it has an impact on
file system semantics, which is a very serious change to any
operating system.  Such changes should never be made 
without a clear idea of what the goals are, and exactly how
the system should look and work.
The issues I personally would like to see addressed include:
What benefits will this provide to the user working at a 
command line?  What about a user running a GUI?  Be
specific, and think like a user, i.e. someone who is 
primarily interested in getting work done with the best
combination of efficiency, ease of use, security, and 
stability possible.
What are the benefits to a sys admin?  Again, "be the 
admin" for the purpose of this answer.
What benefits will this provide to programmers?  Convince 
me as a Linux app. programmer that this is something I 
want to spend the time to learn how to use, and then 
actually support in my programs.  What capabilities does
this add to my toolkit, or what does it improve that I can 
already do?
At each of the 3 key interfaces (CL, GUI, API), will file 
conglomerations always look like directory trees?  Will
they never look like directory trees?  Or will they look like
either, depending on semantic details?  (E.g. use old file 
system calls to treat the cong. as a single file, but use a 
new call to treat it as a directory.)  (IMO, the ability for the
user to take an entire dir, tree of files and treat it as a 
single file (to move it to another system, for example)
without having to resort to tar or any other special handling
could be the biggest single end-user benefit of file cong.)
Will file cong. be supported under all the FS's that Linux
currently supports, and to an equal extent?  If not, exactly 
how will this work with various FS's, as viewed by the three
interfaces (CL, GUI, API)?  (I'm not implying that a "no" 
answer to the first question in this paragraph means don't 
add cong.)
What about changes to basic commands?  Will any be needed
to support dealing with a cong. as a single file vs. a directory?
(It's very tempting to ignore this issue, and only discover 
afterwards that you've added a feature that has created a huge 
demand for "little" changes in dozens of commands.  If it's 
deemed that this level and pervasiveness of change is 
acceptable, fine, but it's another detail that should be decided
now and explicitly, not after the feature is rolled into major 
distributions and the issue is forced.)
Will a CL user be able copy/move/delete/rename a cong. as 
a single entity without resorting to explicitly creating an 
archive of the cong.'s contents with tar or something similar?
Will Windows NT cong. be treated like Linux cong., will they
continue to be visible only as single binaries?  (As Linux grows
in mainstream usage, it will increasingly be used in mixed-mode 
environments on the desktop, making this a far more relevant
issue.)
Will this change entail tradeoffs in terms of system performance, 
usability, complexity, etc.?  If so, what are they likely to be?
Will this support be modular enough that a user or enterprise 
can choose not to use it and have zero impact on the system?
In other words will it be "ignorable"?
Will cong. have passwords?  (Have to use the PW to mount it,
and then it's a normal part of the FS.)  Will cong. support 
compression?  Encryption?  (Yes, this is getting a bit blue-sky,
but if it is decided that these features are definitely desirable, 
then it only makes sense to ensure that today's design is flexible 
enough to accommodate them when the time comes to add
them.)
Will security attributes be set for individual files in the cong., 
for the cong. as a whole, or both--default settings at the 
cong. level, overridden by those of individual files?
Will cong. support scripts/binaries that are stored in the cong. 
and automatically run when the cong. (not the FS that contains
it) is mounted and unmounted? 
(There are some interesting possibilities here for software 
installation and de-installation, since this would provide most
of the support for a very user friendly "software cartridge"
architecture, something I've been working on the design of
for a while.)
Before anyone tries to lynch me, let me point out that in my
experience in operating system and application design and
programming, the two most valuable lessons I learned are
that 1) too centralized and strict control over a software 
design is deadly, and 2) too little control is even worse than
too much.  The "right" amount of control is highly dependent 
on the nature of the project.  Adding file cong. has many 
ramifications for the rest of the system, and requires a lot
of up-front scrutiny, IMO, to add what's really needed, as 
well as to avoid problems in the future.  
I also want to say that I have a lot of respect for the Linux 
programmers and the distributed development model.  I'm 
not in any way advocating a replacement for the current
system.  I'm proposing an extension of it to include a slightly
more coordinated, and, hopefully, more complete and efficient 
analysis of requirements and the high-level design.
As I've said before, if it appears that I can help the process 
by acting as an administrator to help spell out the issues and 
document the answers as you provide them, then I'll gladly 
volunteer and provide the web space.
