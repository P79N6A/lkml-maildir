  2.4.20-31.9 (aka Yea Olde Kernel), it is a redhat 9.0 update from the
  fedora legacy project.
Something is pushing down hard on the dcache, I can watch the numbers
drop after boot up. They start out a few hundred but within a few
minutes they go negative.
I have a fiber channel driver from out the tree loaded (emulex lpfcdd)
but it does not appear to mess with dcache entries itself. Nothing else
from outside the tree. I have not had a chance to try 2.6 yet, not
even sure this code would run on 2.6.
I don't have the source of this app, so all I can do is strace it and
watch that. Actually I don't even need the app, so I can make the problem
go away, but it seems very odd that a user space program can do this.
If I start up the program and watch /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state every second
or so I see a sequence something like this:
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
368     22      45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
364     18      45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
363     16      45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
361     14      45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
361     14      45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
359     13      45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
359     13      45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
359     13      45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
359     13      45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
348     5       45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
332     -16     45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
332     -16     45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
332     -16     45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
332     -16     45      0       0       0
slord@k4> cat /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
332     -16     45      0       0       0
Its not like I am low on memory though:
slord@k4> free
              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       1030108     244932     785176          0      15012     147808
-/+ buffers/cache:      82112     947996
Swap:      1574360         76    1574284
All I can see the program doing is attempting to open these non-existent
/proc entries and doing an ioctl FIBMAP on a /dev/ device bound to the fiber
channel driver. Of course, FIBMAP is not FIBMAP in this driver.
It looks like a steaming pile in there, and I think I am just going to
assume the driver is guilty until proven innocent.
