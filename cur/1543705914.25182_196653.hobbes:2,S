We ran into a bug with #ifdefs like this before.  It was fixed in some
of the code that you're trying to remove.
It's not safe to assume that NUMA && !NUMAQ means SUMMIT.  Remember the
linking errors we got when we turned CONFIG_NUMA on with the regular PC
config?  The generic arch wasn't a problem because it sets
CONFIG_X86_SUMMIT and compiles in the summit code, but the regular PC
code doesn't.  
Also, I don't think we need the #ifdef CONFIG_NUMA around the whole
block.  How about something like this?
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ
	#include <asm/numaq.h>
#elif CONFIG_X86_SUMMIT
	#include <asm/srat.h>
#else
	#define get_memcfg_numa get_memcfg_numa_flat
	#define get_zholes_size(n) (0)
#endif /* CONFIG_NUMA */

Looks like somebody pasted that in from a macro. "(pfn)" :)
