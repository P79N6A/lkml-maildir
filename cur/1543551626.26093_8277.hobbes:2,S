Alright, first off let me say that this cdrecord was working fine with
2.4.0-test8.  The recorder is on /dev/scd0 and also on /dev/sr0.   maybe
this has something to do with it? i'm not sure, but cdrecord keeps saying
the stats for it are -2,-2,-2    when it should be 0,0,0.   Does anyone
know what the hell is going on here? i'm totally lost. I've tried different
versions of cdrecord and all the stable versions i had did the same thing,
i thought an experimental one would have a better shot at an experimental
kernel.

The fact that it says it's a cd-rom and not a CDR bothers me.  Well, i'm up
for suggestions.
