Kernel 2.4.2(working) 2.4.4(broken), Xeon 2-way SMP 400 mhz, 128 mem,
gcc 2.95.3, DHCP Client Daemon v.1.3, Mandrake 7.2
2.4.4 is broken with my epic100/dhcpcd....2.4.2 works fine. I copied
/lib/module/2.4.2../epic100.o to /lib/modules/2.4.4/../epic100.o with no
success.

Followed by more of the same except with status 000b. Unlike the realtek
errors a network stop/start/restart doesn't help. Looking at the patch
for 2.4.4 shows one tiny change to epic100.
