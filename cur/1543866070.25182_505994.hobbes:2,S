Can we get Vincent's signoff here?

This doesn't appear to be defined anywhere, and nor should it be. 
Something subsystem-specific should be used here?

A C function would be nicer here, if poss.

eww.

Is there any benefit in all those casts?  Generally we prefer to avoid
them.

The driver exports a lot of symbols.  Does it really need to?

Please convert to a mutex, if possible.

Greg might have an opinion on that ;)

Please use resource_size_t throughout, test with CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT on
and off.

This might be too large to inline.
