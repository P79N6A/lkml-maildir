Is this crash occuring with 2.6.16-rc1? I ask becuase in that kernel the 
scatterlist passed into scsi_execute_async
if (scsi_execute_async(STp->device, cmd, direction,
			&((STp->buffer)->sg[0]), bytes,
is not the same one that gets send down to the device/HBA.
scsi_execute_async takes the scatterlist passed to it from st or sg, 
uses it as a hint to build a request + bios, then later when the request 
is sent to the device a new scatterlist is sent to the device and the 
device does the pci/dma operation on that scatterlist from the 
block/scsi layer.
