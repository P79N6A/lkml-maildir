OK, I've had a quick squiz at it.

Yep, it should just be in devfs.

Sigh. It's a pity that the RTC dev driver implements a read() method.
Otherwise I'd urge a scheme like MTRR: read() for humans and ioctl()
for programmes.
Hm. Is the current rtc_read() method actually used by applications?
Otherwise, /dev/misc/rtc.txt is probably right.
