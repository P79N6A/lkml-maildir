I reported this some time ago as a problem with using offset mounting CDs
with a binary prefix before the ISO image. And since it seems that the
problem is not the offset but the sector size, the problems may be
related.
I'll look at this over the weekend if not before. It works with 2.0 and
2.2, I use it regularly, and it's the main thing keeping a few of my
machines on 2.2.
