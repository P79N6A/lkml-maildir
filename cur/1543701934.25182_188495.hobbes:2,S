In some cases x86-64 pci_map_sg causes a BUG() when you pass it an already
mapped list. I've got reports of that happening with Qlogic.
I haven't analyzed it in detail, whether the mid layer or the driver
or someone else is to blame.

It documents that pci_map_sg rewrites the sg list and never guarantees
that the rewriting is undone on pci_unmap_sg.

Yep. While it would be in theory possible to reconstruct the list at
unmap time it would be extremly costly (require lots of uncached
memory access on x86-64) and is not done.

I'm just pointing out the requirements of pci_map_sg.
Either you can keep a flag around somewhere that says if the list is
mapped or not and skip the remapping and don't do a unmap in
between. Or copy and make sure the page reference counts are correctly
maintained.  I'm not very intimate with the SCSI/block code so you
guys have to decide what is more convenient.
