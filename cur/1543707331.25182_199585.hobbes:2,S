KDB (Linux Kernel Debugger) has been updated.
ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/kdb/download/v4.3/
Current versions are :-
  kdb-v4.3-2.6.3-common-1.bz2
  kdb-v4.3-2.6.3-i386-1.bz2
  kdb-v4.3-2.6.3-ia64-1.bz2
The only change since 2.6.3-rc4-common-1 and 2.6.3-rc3-{i386,ia6}-1
is to update the changelogs to reflect the base 2.6.3 kernel.
Warning: the 2.6 versions of kdb have had minimal testing.  In
particular they have not been tested with CONFIG_PREEMPT.
