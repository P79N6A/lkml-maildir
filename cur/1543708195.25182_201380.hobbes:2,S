Only because I've hit this problem before.  With the original IRQMUX
patches, they managed to probe the available IRQs (finding IRQ3 and IRQ4
available) and then changed IRQMUX preventing these signals working.
The net result was that an inserted card was allocated IRQ3 or IRQ4
and no surprises that it was unable to signal its interrupt.
