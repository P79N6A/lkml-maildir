Umm... It does recovery, but we do extra write on blocks we've managed to
allocate. Thanks for spotting - looks like a bug that had been in the patch
for a month or so ;-/ clear_bit it is...
Looking one more time... generic_file_write() is very odd:
        if (pos > inode->i_sb->s_maxbytes)
        {
                send_sig(SIGXFSZ, current, 0);
                err = -EFBIG;
                goto out;
        }
        if (pos + count > inode->i_sb->s_maxbytes)
        {
                count = inode->i_sb->s_maxbytes - count;
                goto out;
        }
 
looks funny - goto out means that new (and rather meaningless) value of
count goes to hell. Shouldn't we remove that line and s/- count/- pos/
in the previous one? Besides, do we really want the limit on size ber
0x.......f for ext2? 0x7fffffff comes from s32 returned by lseek(), and
thus - for size. ext2 limit should be a multiple of block size...
