i've uploaded the latest, 2.4.16-D5 TUX patch, which now compiles with
your .config:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/TUX-patches/tux2-full-2.4.16-final-D5.bz2
for the latest TUX patches you'll also need the 2.1.1-10 version of the
TUX utilities:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/TUX-patches/tux-2.1.1.tar.gz
let me know if there are still any compilation/linking (or other)
problems,
	Ingo
