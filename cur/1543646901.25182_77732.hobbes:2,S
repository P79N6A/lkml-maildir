Subject: [PATCH] oprofile for 2.5.41
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Please see
http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/oprofile-2.5.html
for the necessary user-space tools, and the latest patch.
Note the change to fs/locks.c is necessary, otherwise you will end up
dropping almost all samples on the floor. A proper patch hasn't yet made
its way Linuswards...
This seems to work for me now. In the absence of any necessary major
changes, I intend to split it up into readable chunks and feed it to
Linus fairly soon.
regards
john
