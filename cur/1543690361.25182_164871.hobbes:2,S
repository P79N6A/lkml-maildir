Dear Andrea,
We're providing the service which enables all of the below and without
our good will that service is at risk.  You're publicly slamming the
providers of that service.
If you want to do that, that's your right, but that leads us to ask:
    - wasn't the deal that we do the gateway and you stop whining?
    - why should we provide this gateway service at all if there is whining?
    - why shouldn't we firewall you off since you are whining?
    - or if firewalling fails, put in a day or two delay in the gateway?
