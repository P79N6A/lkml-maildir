Hi,
Well, unfortunately I have only a little experience with writing device
drivers, so please take my comments below with a grain of salt.
Also, I think it's better to discuss this on linux-pm to which some more
experienced people are subscribed.

Yes, that seems to be the right solution.

Frankly, I'm not sure why that is so.

AFAICS, it is not and these drivers should probably be modified not to do so.
The problem, as I see it, is that we don't know what state the device will be
in during the resume (this may be a resume from disk and the device may have
been initialized by the BIOS and we get it actually generating interrupts).

I'm not sure of that.  Sounds better than freeing the IRQs in .suspend() to me.
