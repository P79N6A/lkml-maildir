Subject: [patch 2.6.18-git] i2c/tps65010, update for current i2c-omap
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/29/24

This updates the TPS6501x driver to stop trying to use the faked-out
I2C probe protocol (never guaranteed to work), since the OMAP I2C
driver merged to kernel.org no longer tries to support it.
Until the I2C stack is updated to offer full driver model support from
static board-specific device tables, and is able to pass things like
IRQ resources and chip IDs, the only way to address this type of issue
is for drivers to have board-specific info kick in before registering
the driver (for addressing), and in the probe code (for other resources).
So that's what this patch adds.
