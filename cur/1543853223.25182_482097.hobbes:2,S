and this is why shipping 2 drivers suck.
"A has a bug so I need to use B" is the wrong answer, at least long
term. The real answer is "fix A".
I know it sucks for you, but if shipping B means A doesn't get fixed, or
worse, bugs in A hardly get reported... it means the short term is
hurting the long term, and just prolongs the pain even for you...
(since switching drivers is a pain, and more and more stuff is depending
on alsa nowadays)
