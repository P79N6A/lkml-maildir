Well, the CONFIG_EISA option is there.  My little patch was just intended to 
slightly enlighten those prone to "lets see what this option does".  I 
compiled test11-pre4 both with and without CONFIG_EISA and the difference is
very slight.  Of course, if you had more items with EISA code, this difference
would be bigger.

The difference probably comes from my 3c59x driver.
I also uglied up the 3c59x.c code with #ifdef CONFIG_EISA around the
six sections relavant to EISA to see if that would save anything, and the
object file was only 318 bytes smaller, probably not worth the uglyness of
the six ifdefs.  That modified code was not used in the above comparison.
I am running that modified code right now, BTW.
Jeff, I can send you the patch for the hacked up 3c59x.c if you're at all 
interested.
