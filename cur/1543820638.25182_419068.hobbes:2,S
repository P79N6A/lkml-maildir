Is your OS installed either sda or sdb?
Because I get this type of message using a single disk... On which my FC5 stands...
I'll give it a try tonight and see if I can cause the problem manually but I doubt I'll be able to stop the system from hanging...  Unless my bug is not related.

I can duplicate my problem everything, and I can make it stop a will.
doing "dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=64k &"
and then
        "dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/null bs=64k &"
will cause the problem within a couple of seconds.
Doing "kill %1 %2" (assuming the dd's are %1 and %2) will stop the machine from hanging on disk io within 30-60 seconds.
Once it hangs it does not appear to do any disk io until the offending processes are killed.
