No... I said to build on the upcall/downcall mechanism. I said nothing
about modifying the on-the-wire protocol.
My point is that we have evolved more or less GENERIC mechanisms for
calling up to userland with a string/number and having it mapped into
something else via a downcall. (worse: in fact we have 2 mechanisms for
doing it - one that is used by the client, the other by the server).
The only way in which we fail to meet the above requirements are that
the code to do it is in the NFS/RPC layers. Move it out of there, and it
could be reused by everybody.
No need for a third upcall/downcall mechanism that does the same thing.
Cheers,
  Trond
