Hi all .
I am working on serial communication protocol for an x86 industrial platform ,
namely Advantech PCM 5825 CPU board + PCM 3618 RS232/485  communication board.
Tried 2.4.33 and 2.6.18...20 kernels .
After investigating some incoming data corruption I noticed that
sometimes the status value that has been read from LSR  contains the
"FIFO error" bit set ( 0x80 ) . I did not find a code that handle this
condition , there is no even such bit mask defined in serial_reg.h .
BTW I have this bit set even if all other error bits in LSR are 0  (
frame error etc.) .
Is there any reason for not to handle the "FIFO error " bit ?
Or it is just because the situation is very rare ?
Any comments appreciated .
Thanks .
