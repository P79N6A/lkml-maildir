When I initially posted the problem, I had no /dev/hdc device but now I 
have cleared that up by commenting out
the "append hdc=ide-scsi" line in /etc/lilo.conf.   I still need to do 
more testing to determine the cause of the lockups
I have been getting when trying to burn CD's under 2.6.9 with cdrecord.  
I may be using the wrong version of
cdrecord, but I noticed that the syntax   "cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc" does 
work, and is able to talk to the DVD writer.
