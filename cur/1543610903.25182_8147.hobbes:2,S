And the response would be "See the Welcome Message in the FTP directory" or 
"See the notice on the home page" (assuming the suggestion of having a 
hotlink on www.kernel.org point to a "necessary patch" page).
Yes, the emails will still come, but after a while people will catch on and 
the quantity of such emails will lessen.
