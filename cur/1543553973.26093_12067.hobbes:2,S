What state does it leave the condition codes ?  That matters. 
Take for example
if (!oldval)
                asm volatile(
                        "2:"
                        "cmpl $-1, %0;"
                        "rep; nop;"
                        "je 2b;"
                        	: :"m" (current->need_resched));
}
When running SMP with poll_idle enabled. I can't see it changing condition
codes on an athlon but..
