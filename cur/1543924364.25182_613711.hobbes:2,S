From: Theodore Ts'o <>
Subject: [PATCH,RFC 3/3] scripts/setlocalversion: Fix false positive -dirty tag caused by make-kpkg
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/2/337

make-kpkg modifies scripts/package/Makefile and deletes
scripts/package/builddeb as part of its build process.  Ignore these
changes so the tree isn't marked as -dirty, when it is just an
artifact of make-kpkg.  (make-kpkg clean restores the files to their
original state, and these helper scripts won't affect the final
compiled kernel in any way.)
