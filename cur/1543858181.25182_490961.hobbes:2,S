Of course you can't, there are no kernel header files left.

Those are userspace header files, not for building modules. They may 
have worked in certain setups for doing this in the past but this was 
never recommended. Current distributions no longer include any 
kernel-internal headers in /usr/include anymore.
You do need at least a partial kernel source tree to build modules against.
