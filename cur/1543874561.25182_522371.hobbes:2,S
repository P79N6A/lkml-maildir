The slab rewrite first allocates a page and then determines where it 
came from instead of requiring the page allocator to allocate from a 
certain node. Plus SLUB does not keep per cpu or per node object queues. 
So the problem does not occur in the same way. The per cpu slab in SLUB 
can contain objects from another node whereas SLAB can only put node local 
objects on its queues.
