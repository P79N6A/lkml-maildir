+ * struct hw_breakpoint - unified kernel/user-space hardware breakpoint
+ * @node: internal linked-list management
+ * @triggered: callback invoked after target address access
+ * @installed: callback invoked when the breakpoint is installed
+ * @uninstalled: callback invoked when the breakpoint is uninstalled
+ * @info: arch-specific breakpoint info (address, length, and type)
+ * @priority: requested priority level
+ * @status: current registration/installation status
+ *
+ * %hw_breakpoint structures are the kernel's way of representing
+ * hardware breakpoints.  These are data breakpoints
+ * (also known as "watchpoints", triggered on data access), and the breakpoint's
+ * target address can be located in either kernel space or user space.
+ *
+ * The breakpoint's address, length, and type are highly
+ * architecture-specific.  The values are encoded in the @info field; you
+ * specify them when registering the breakpoint.  To examine the encoded
+ * values use hw_breakpoint_get_{kaddress,uaddress,len,type}(), declared
+ * below.
+ *
+ * The address is specified as a regular kernel pointer (for kernel-space
+ * breakponts) or as an %__user pointer (for user-space breakpoints).
+ * With register_user_hw_breakpoint(), the address must refer to a
+ * location in user space.  The breakpoint will be active only while the
+ * requested task is running.  Conversely with
+ * register_kernel_hw_breakpoint(), the address must refer to a location
+ * in kernel space, and the breakpoint will be active on all CPUs
+ * regardless of the current task.
+ *
+ * The length is the breakpoint's extent in bytes, which is subject to
+ * certain limitations.  include/asm/hw_breakpoint.h contains macros
+ * defining the available lengths for a specific architecture.  Note that
+ * the address's alignment must match the length.  The breakpoint will
+ * catch accesses to any byte in the range from address to address +
+ * (length - 1).
+ *
+ * The breakpoint's type indicates the sort of access that will cause it
+ * to trigger.  Possible values may include:
+ *
+ * 	%HW_BREAKPOINT_RW (triggered on read or write access),
+ * 	%HW_BREAKPOINT_WRITE (triggered on write access), and
+ * 	%HW_BREAKPOINT_READ (triggered on read access).
+ *
+ * Appropriate macros are defined in include/asm/hw_breakpoint.h; not all
+ * possibilities are available on all architectures.  Execute breakpoints
+ * must have length equal to the special value %HW_BREAKPOINT_LEN_EXECUTE.
+ *
+ * When a breakpoint gets hit, the @pre_handler or @post_handler (whichever or
+ * both depending upon architecture support and assignment by user) callback is
+ * invoked in_interrupt with a pointer to the %hw_breakpoint structure and the
+ * processor registers.
+ * Data breakpoints occur after the memory access has taken place.
+ * Breakpoints are disabled during execution @triggered, to avoid
+ * recursive traps and allow unhindered access to breakpointed memory.
+ *
+ * Hardware breakpoints are implemented using the CPU's debug registers,
+ * which are a limited hardware resource.  Requests to register a
+ * breakpoint will always succeed provided the parameters are valid,
+ * but the breakpoint may not be installed in a debug register right
+ * away.  Physical debug registers are allocated based on the priority
+ * level stored in @priority (higher values indicate higher priority).
+ * User-space breakpoints within a single thread compete with one
+ * another, and all user-space breakpoints compete with all kernel-space
+ * breakpoints; however user-space breakpoints in different threads do
+ * not compete.  %HW_BREAKPOINT_PRIO_PTRACE is the level used for ptrace
+ * requests; an unobtrusive kernel-space breakpoint will use
+ * %HW_BREAKPOINT_PRIO_NORMAL to avoid disturbing user programs.  A
+ * kernel-space breakpoint that always wants to be installed and doesn't
+ * care about disrupting user debugging sessions can specify
+ * %HW_BREAKPOINT_PRIO_HIGH.
+ *
+ * A particular breakpoint may be allocated (installed in) a debug
+ * register or deallocated (uninstalled) from its debug register at any
+ * time, as other breakpoints are registered and unregistered.  The
+ * @installed and @uninstalled callbacks are invoked in_atomic when these
+ * events occur.  It is legal for @installed or @uninstalled to be %NULL,
+ * but one of the handlers - @pre_handler or @post_handler must be populated
+ * (please check support for your architecture using pre_ and
+ * post_handler_supported() routines to check for support.  Note that it is not
+ * possible to register or unregister a user-space breakpoint from within a
+ * callback routine, since doing so requires a process context.  Note that for
+ * user breakpoints, while in @installed and @uninstalled the thread may be
+ * context switched. Hence it may not be safe to call printk().
+ *
+ * For kernel-space breakpoints, @installed is invoked after the
+ * breakpoint is actually installed and @uninstalled is invoked before
+ * the breakpoint is actually uninstalled.  As a result the @pre_ and
+ * @post_handler() routines may be invoked when not expected, but this way you
+ * will know that during the time interval from @installed to @uninstalled, all
+ * events are faithfully reported.  (It is not possible to do any better than
+ * this in general, because on SMP systems there is no way to set a debug
+ * register simultaneously on all CPUs.)  The same isn't always true with
+ * user-space breakpoints, but the differences should not be visible to a
+ * user process.
+ *
+ * If you need to know whether your kernel-space breakpoint was installed
+ * immediately upon registration, you can check the return value from
+ * register_kernel_hw_breakpoint().  If the value is not > 0, you can
+ * give up and unregister the breakpoint right away.
+ *
+ * @node and @status are intended for internal use.  However @status
+ * may be read to determine whether or not the breakpoint is currently
+ * installed.  (The value is not reliable unless local interrupts are
+ * disabled.)
+ *
+ * This sample code sets a breakpoint on pid_max and registers a callback
+ * function for writes to that variable.  Note that it is not portable
+ * as written, because not all architectures support HW_BREAKPOINT_LEN_4.
