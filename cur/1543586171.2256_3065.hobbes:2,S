Maybe some details here were helpful. Are you referring to
madvise()/mlock? Maybe malloc and friends could be modified to reserve
newly allocate pages. For things like fork()/exec() a new flag is
probably required to ensure this, or the new process could actually
run a syscall first to ensure all memory can be accessed.

Not right. AIX has two lowlevel marks, if I understand the thread right,
we would use freepages.low and freepages.min.
If freepages.low is hit, a SIGDANGER is sent to all processes. The signal
is *ignored by default*. In the handler, an easy to use syscall (no
odd /proc file parsing (really, I don't like this bloatage, if I could I
would disable it for its security issues in certain places, at least in
the past, but it is no longer possible to live w/o it) can be used to
learn about the pages left. If it's not clear that SIGDANGER is only
triggered by oom we should have a nice syscall/libcall
like is_paging_space_low().
If freepages.min is reached, AIX starts to kill processes (just like OOM
killer). It uses some heuristics which might be better than our, but I
doubt it. Probably background (no ctty) and long running processes should
be preserved if possible. short term running, interactive progs can
typically just be restarted, but loosing one weeks computation is bad
(now a sensible application should actually checkpoint itself).
AIX also often kills the wrong process: Typical situation here: user A
runs a long running experiment, user B logs in, doesn't check load of the
machine, starts a too large application and user A's appl. dies while the
one of B survices for half an hour and dies too. 
The OOM killer of AIX honours catching SIGDANGER. It kills those procs
last. A nice trick is to make a no_op handler for it. This will have your
proc die last.
