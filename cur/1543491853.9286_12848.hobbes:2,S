Hi,
	With the new kmod design, the Sound FAQ answer about replacing the PC
speaker beep with a kerneld hook seems rather out of date.   What is the
right way to do this now?  Should one cut-and-paste from kmod.c into a
new module and hook kd_mksound into that?  Or is that a bad idea?  Or
have I misunderstood something basic?
