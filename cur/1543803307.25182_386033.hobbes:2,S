Well, it turns out that google does not (yet) know what a SPI driver
subsystem is yet... And SPI can be any of these in LKML context:
SCSI Parallel Interface
Serial Peripheral Interface
Service Provider Interface
Stateful Packet Inspection
System Packet Interface
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPI
Betting on the last, based on the filenames in the changelog...

May be just a browser accessible URL for Documentation/spi/spi-summary or at
least a definition of SPI in the header of the mail.
git is just too complex for me at htemoment (haven't found the time to learn it)
Sorry for bugging you, Greg :-|
