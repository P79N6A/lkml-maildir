> Help! Using 2.4.18 (and verified as far back as .9) - I am getting a process freeze when an application does an fsync. Turning off HIGHMEM (the box has 2GB ram) solves the issue. Is there anyone who is interested in learning more about this situation? Please CC to nkirsch@insynq.com. 
Please try the -aa kernel patch series.
Also, many people including myself have had better responce from -rmap, but
you should probably give -aa a try first.
