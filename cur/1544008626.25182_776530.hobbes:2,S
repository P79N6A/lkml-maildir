This comment isn't right - return 0 if a measurement must be

I'm not sure what you mean here - must_measure for instance is used (in
patch 3) in the integrity hooks (i.e. file_mmap) to decide whether or not 
the object (action target) must be measured.

That comment doesn't make sense to me (unless you're saying to punt
on the generic integrity infrastructure and hook all of the IMA
code straight into the kernel) so I suspect I'm misreading
something.
