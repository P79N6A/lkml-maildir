Oh I didn't state anywhere that one should not keep drivers available
on a public web page or similar for people to upgrade older kernels -
thats basically what Donald Becker does and I do it as well.

I don't know what Donald's point is on this one, but I do know that a
maintainer is not always available or has time to upgrade something
when a kernel is upgraded. I know of this, I do have drivers of my
own, and even though I admit it can be nuisance, it is still the only
way for people to get a chance to use the code.

Why are you trying to explain this to me like I never wrote a line of
kernel code.

API's have to change sometimes for various reasons, this is how the
Linux kernel development model works. Fortunately Linus is not afraid
of braking the API if some serious bug is found that cannot be fixed
without breaking the old API.

It is the only thing that work, real life has proven that.

Thats what tools like perl and sed were invented for.
