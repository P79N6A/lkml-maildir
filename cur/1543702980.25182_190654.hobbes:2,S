How? build a fragmented skb on the receive path and send it
upwards. Last I looked at the relevant code (2.4.something), however,
the tcp/ip stack called skb_linearize() on the skb on its way up, so
you wouldn't gain anything unless you teach it to deal with fragmented
skb's all the way up. That's just what I recall - this subject was
discussed several times in the past, look in the archives for details.
