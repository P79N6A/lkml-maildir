Thank you Rickard and Damir for reassuring me that this change is highly 
unlikely to impact any of the connection methods I use. Since PCMCIA on 
desktops and non-udev systems are uncommon, I felt the question was 
better mentioned before the patch went in. Occasionally my confiurations 
do result in a "nobody would do that" reaction.
I hope it solves your problems as well.
