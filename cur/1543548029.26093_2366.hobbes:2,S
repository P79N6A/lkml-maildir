It *sounds* very familiar.  From Documentation/Configure.help:
Processor family
CONFIG_M386
  This is the processor type of your CPU. This information is used for
  optimizing purposes. In order to compile a kernel that can run on
  all x86 CPU types (albeit not optimally fast), you can specify
  "386" here.
  The kernel will not necessarily run on earlier architectures than
  the one you have chosen, e.g. a Pentium optimized kernel will run on
  a PPro, but not necessarily on a i486.
  Here are the settings recommended for greatest speed:
   - "386" for the AMD/Cyrix/Intel 386DX/DXL/SL/SLC/SX, Cyrix/TI
     486DLC/DLC2, UMC 486SX-S and NexGen Nx586. Only "386" kernels
will
     run on a 386 class machine.
   - "486" for the AMD/Cyrix/IBM/Intel 486DX/DX2/DX4 or
     SL/SLC/SLC2/SLC3/SX/SX2 and UMC U5D or U5S.
   - "586" for generic Pentium CPUs, possibly lacking the TSC
     (time stamp counter) register.
   - "Pentium-Classic" for the Intel Pentium.
   - "Pentium-MMX" for the Intel Pentium MMX.
   - "Pentium-Pro" for the Intel Pentium Pro/Celeron/Pentium II.
   - "Pentium-III" for the Intel Pentium III.
   - "K6" for the AMD K6, K6-II and K6-III (aka K6-3D).
   - "Athlon" for the AMD Athlon (K7).
   - "Crusoe" for the Transmeta Crusoe series.
   - "Winchip-C6" for original IDT Winchip.
   - "Winchip-2" for IDT Winchip 2.
   - "Winchip-2A" for IDT Winchips with 3dNow! capabilities.
  If you don't know what to do, choose "386".
According to this, it looks like you should be building for (I
presume) a 486.
