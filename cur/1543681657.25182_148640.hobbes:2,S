Didn't see anything relevant in the Changes file or a grep through
Documentation dir.
I can SSH out of my 2.6.0-test1 box (IPv4 and IPv6).  When I try to ssh
in though I get a prompt for a passphrase like normal but once I enter
it nothing happens it just hangs there.
On bootup I get multiple FATAL messages about tty and ttyS.  They're
scattered throughout the startup process and don't seem tied to any
particular init scripts.
