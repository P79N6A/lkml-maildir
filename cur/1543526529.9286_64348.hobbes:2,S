ST> You are confusing two entirely different things.
No exactly. The ultimate goal is to give user ability to use floppy
"as in Windows" and to have working filesystem if user doing everything
right.

If you want to prompt user to put floppy back toy should not make sure that
data is on the floppy as soon as possible.

Exactly. And if THAT problem is solved then first problem should not be solved
(you always can ask user to put floppy back).

Who are "we" ? "Need" for ? Etc.

What about mmap ? What about not last file (when you open file in MS Word
it'll create lock file near opened file and WILL NOT close that file till
windows with document is closed; do you still guarantee that "File"->"Save"
operation will be completed before LED is off?). Etc, etc.

No, I'm right. If we are talking about ALL EXISTING programs, and all types
of users of course.

Do you really allow user to install any software he/she wants and use it ?
ST> It worked.
In VERY limited environment. Perhaps. If user with his/her floppy is gone
it's useless to ask he/she to put floppy back. So perhaps for cybercafe
supermount is right solution. This is NOT right solution for LOTS AND LOTS
of other places (especially where user can install software on his/her own).
So let supermount be what it is: limited solution for limited usage. That is:
separate patch, not part of kernel.
