You can discover it has been loaded by monitoring returns from commands sent
to the drive. The magicdev toy in Red Hat 6.1 does the mount handling for
the gnome desktop. It doesn't try to address umount. That requires the
stackable fs stuff and then a port of Stephen Tweedie's supermount fs code.
Magicdev is free software so should give you a chunk of the code you need.
