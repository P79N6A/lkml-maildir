	The main reason I did this was to maintain a certain consistency
with drivers I've seen.. I originally implemented it in a very similar
fashion to the way you did in your attached patch, but decided it would be
better just to have one parameter called aha1542.

	Yeah, this checking really isn't necessary, but I just felt like
adding it.  There are some cleaner ways I can think of, but my method
seems to most clear to me.  I could have checked the ranges for buson,
busoff, and even dmaspeed, but I'd basically have to check every value for
base_address, and I wanted to keep it consistent throughout the code.  I
do suppose I could remove the checking altogether though, since it isn't
really necessary.

	Stupidity on my part, perhaps?  For some reason, it didn't even
occur to me to do that.

	Thanks.  I may go through what I've done and see if I can clean it
up a bit.
