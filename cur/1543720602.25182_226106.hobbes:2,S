Hey folks,
I noticed that 2.6.7-rc1 was supposed to have Dothan
support for cpufreq, but since neither it nor -rc2
worked  on my machine, I decided to take a look at the
code and see if I couldn't figure something out.  I
saw this:
static const struct cpu_id cpu_id_dothan_a1 = {
        .x86_vendor = X86_VENDOR_INTEL,
        .x86 = 6,
        .x86_model = 13,
        .x86_mask = 1,
};
Attempting to match this against /proc/cpuinfo, I
changed it to
static const struct cpu_id cpu_id_dothan_a1 = {
        .x86_vendor = X86_VENDOR_INTEL,
        .x86 = 6,
        .x86_model = 13,
        .x86_mask = 6,
};
This worked, creating
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ and the whole
shebang.  So, for whomever is in charge of cpufreq,
the above change needs to be integrated in order for
(some?) Dothans to work.
Since I don't currently subscribe to linux-kernel, I
would appreciate it if any replies/etc could be CC'd
to me, nyte2k@yahoo.com
Thanks,
Athul Acharya
