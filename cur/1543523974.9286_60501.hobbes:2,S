I use an ASUS PL97 LX chipset based MB since 2 years and didn't experience
any problem using numerous kinds of 538XX chipsets on this board. But I
donnot have a 53C810 rev. 1.

DSTAT=0xa0  (0x20=PCI BUS FAULT)
Bit 0x20 means that a PCI transaction issued by the 53C810 chip has been 
terminated with abort condition by the PCI target (Host bridge here).
The problem seems to occur when the 53C810 fetches the next SCRIPTS
instruction from memory (using a PCI read transaction).

The error is weird there. The SCRIPTS that probes against cache
configuration is pretty simple and sharing the interrupt should not 
make differences since no interrupt should occur at this time.
W95 seeming to work does not prove anything. A hardware problem may only
affect a subset of the possible O/Ses since different O/Ses and drivers
behave differently. Btw, I only have some understanding of Linux and
FreeBSD. Comparisons against these 2 ones may help a bit more.

May-be it is a coincidence, but the 3 BUS FAULTs occur after the SCRIPTS
having switched the controller LED. My immediate suggestion is to check
that the MB configuration is correct, especially the PCI BUS clock that
shall be 33 MHz or less, and to make sure that the power supply is good,
then to give a try with the following as possible: 
1) Tell the driver at boot to not drive the controller LED.
   Use the following boot options:  ncr53c8xx=led:n
2) Remove physically the second processor and see if this makes
   differences.
3) Give a try with the minimum of PCI boards installed.
4) Move PCI boards to different connectors as possible.
5) Give a try with minimum of memory installed.
   If you system has several DIM, move them or try successively with 
   only one of them installed.
