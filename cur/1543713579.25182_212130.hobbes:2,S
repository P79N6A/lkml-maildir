Hi, thanks for the comments.

That is correct, yes.

Note there was already that check in the wakeup path, although
I suspect it was someone being overly cautious and isn't required.
Also in my patch, the offline check should probably be done below
the check for if (cpu == this_cpu... because that should be a common
route.

OK, whatever you like. At least you have my alternative if
you ever run into a problem here.

Yeah, so Rusty pointed out. It still potentially moves a lot fewer
tasks though, but I guess it was really waiting for a patch like
yours ;)

I really don't have much interest in the code so it is up to you.
If you ever have some realtime system that does cpu hotplugging
then give me a call!
