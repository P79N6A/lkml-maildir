Sorry, the problem is queueing of large amounts of RCU callbacks in a
short period of time, as already discussed.
Since ksoftirq is running (as can be seen from the dumps you sent), I
_guess_ that the grace period has happened already, and ksoftirq is
attempting to execute the RCU callbacks.
An important fact that causes the direct reclaim throttling to fail is
the complete lack of pagecache pages on both DMA and normal zones (zero
on both).
Can you try this hack (might need to include linux/interrupt.h and
linux/rcupdate.h)
