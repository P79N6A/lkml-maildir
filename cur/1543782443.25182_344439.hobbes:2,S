There can quite easily be lots of pending IO for the io_context (and, in
CFQ's case, below cfq_io_contexts), task exiting is completely decoupled
from any pending io.
Then there's the cfq_exit_io_context() locking. I have to ponder this a
bit, I cannot even convince myself that it is currently safe right now.
