Unfortunately I don't see why this patch causes such breakage.
Could you apply the following patch with the previous patch applied
and see if sshd still segfaults ?
It basically reverts:
   do_mpage_readpage-remove-first_logical_block-parameter-fix.patch
Therefore I can see which part of the patch is broken.
Also can you tell me what the block size used by the file system
hosting sshd ?
Thanks !
