The only thing I can see as an improvement that a mutex can offer over 
the current semaphore implementation is if we can perform the same 
optimization that spinlocks perform in the unlock operation: don't use 
a locked, serialising instruction in the up() codepath.  That might be 
a bit tricky to implement, but it's definately a win on the P4 where the 
cost of serialisation can be quite high.

History?  I think that code is very close to what was done in the pre-SMP 
version of semaphores.  It is certainly possible to get rid of the separate 
sleepers -- parisc seems to have such an implementation.  It updates 
sem->count in the wakeup path of __down().
