When a program is writing to a terminal device, then we know it's
going to a terminal _or_ to a program which is pretending to be one
(pseudo-terminal).  Either way, the behaviour should be the same
The "screen" program can be used to do translation, although it's a
rather cumbersome way to go about it, and it has other effects which
are annoying (at least one key is always designated for "screen" commands).
