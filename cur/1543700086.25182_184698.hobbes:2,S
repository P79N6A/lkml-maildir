Hello,
Does the  ext3 file systems have to wait for the acknowledgement of block of 
data written to the SCSI device before writing the next block of data.
Is there a parallel I/O where the file system goes on writing the block of 
data
without waiting for the acknowledgement.
Please let me know your opinion.
Thanks
Jayshankar
