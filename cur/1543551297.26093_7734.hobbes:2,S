RLIMIT_DATA appears to only be checked for aout format executables.
Looking at the 2.4.0-test10pre1 sources for fs/binfmt_aout.c and
fs/binfmt_elf.c you'll note the difference in load_aout_binary() and
load_elf_binary(), both just above the comment of "OK, This is the point
of no return"
Does putting a similar check to the aout one make sense for ELF?
I'm just trying to avoid Rik having to pull his hair out implementing a
system that conceptually already exists in the kernel (nasty processes
being terminated before they do some damage).  Especially when that
existing system is far more configurable.
Cheers,
