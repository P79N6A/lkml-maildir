This is true in the case of externally-visible stuff. I think the
compiler is permitted to violate the ABI for purely unit-internal things
if it makes sense though, isn't it?
Besides, in the case of the Linux kernel the ABI in question could be
one of many. It could even be a new one which was added a couple of
weeks ago, and which I had no _chance_ of considering.
The rule stands -- empirical testing of what the compiler will do isn't
usually the right answer.
