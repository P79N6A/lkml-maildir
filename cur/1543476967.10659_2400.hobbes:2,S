I've just upgraded from 2.1.131 to 2.2.0pre5 & 2.2.0pre6 and
now I have trouble building boot disks using LILO. It looks
like the problem is in the detection of the geometry of my 
IDE hard disk:
in 2.1.131 cat /proc/ide/hda/geometry results in:
physical     4092/16/63
logical      847/128/63
in 2.2.0 pre5/6 I get :
physical     4092/16/63
logical      511/128/63
the actual physical geometry of the disk is 6780/16/63 
so both kernels get that one wrng - but at least the 2.1.131
get the logical correctly (from the BIOS)
After making a kernel and typing make install I get:
[..make stuff deleted..]
Creating a lilo bootdisk...
mkdir /tmp/boot12461
mke2fs -q /dev/fd0
mke2fs 1.12, 9-Jul-98 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /tmp/boot12461
cd /tmp/boot12461
cp /boot/vmlinuz /boot/boot.b .
lilo -C - <<- EOF2
geo_comp_addr: Cylinder 823 beyond end of media (511)
set +e; cd /; umount /dev/fd0; rmdir /tmp/boot12461
The created boot disk is not bootable. I can boot into 
2.1.131 and make the boot disks for 2.2.preX.
To me it seems like there was a bug introduced - or
do I need to change the way how I make my boot disks
(by providing the explicit geometry)?
