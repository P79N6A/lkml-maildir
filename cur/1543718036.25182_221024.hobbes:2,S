Yes, that is correct.
The instability was first noticed about one month ago when doing
a bk pull from linus' repository.  I've been updating my kernel via
bk almost nightly, and around the time of 2.6.6-rc1 (IIRC), I got the
Assertion `s && s->tree' failed message from bk.  At first it was thought
to be related to using an older version (3.0.1) of bk, so that was updated.
A few days later, the problem recurred.  Since it only happened about
15% to 20% of the time, and was easy to recover from, I didn't scream
too loudly or too often to bitmover.  But then, the problem started becoming
more persistent about a week ago, so I began complaining again.  I managed
to get a bitkeeper-generated file to bitmover, who discovered that a very
odd (or even in this case) number of NUL bytes existed where they 
should not exist.  Hence this thread.
Then during the course of testing, I noticed the significant difference
in time it took to run a test script supplied by bitkeeper for current kernels
versus an older vendor kernel.  Hence your being cc'ed.

Yes, mea culpa.  CONFIG_SND_ENS1371=y.
