As opposed to modern mail servers which can send messages of any size
using constant sized small (well under 1M) processes.

You saw load while sending a single file?  Modern mail servers can send
without generating significant load (unless your server was a 386).
I've used older Pentium boxes that could send 60 messages at a time
without hitting .1 load.
Anyways, this is rather off topic for linux-kernel.
