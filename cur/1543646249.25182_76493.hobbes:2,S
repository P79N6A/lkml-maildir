list_empty() can be used on check list heads *or*
to check if a list element is currently in a list,
assuming the coder uses list_del_init(). However,
if the coder chooses to use list_del() [which sets
the prev and next fields to 0] instead, there is no
corresponding function to indicate if that element
is currently on a list. This function does that.
