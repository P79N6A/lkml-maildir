Hello,
linus.patch from -mm1:
# BitKeeper/deleted/.del-802_11.h~9b6bd4cff8af7a90
#   2004/06/18 09:47:58-07:00 torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org +0 -0
#   Delete: include/linux/802_11.h
Why was this file removed? The IPW2100 driver
(
http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net
) uses its definitions and now won't build
against -bk or -mm kernel source.
