There's no layering violation - the buffer cache code is by definition in
the set of code that knows about block devices. Effectively, that code is
a set of private member functions of 'blockdevice'.

fs/devices.c is (or was) an obvious place to start. Note, my goal is not
just to erase the distinction there between block and char, which is
fairly trivial, but between major and minor as well. My aim is flatten the
"address space" so that you can make arbitrary registrations (similar to
what CIDR did to IP). I really don't have a problem with your block_device
approach, except that register_dev, open, and inode shouldn't be forced to
know about it.

I don't know if that analogy flies. Loop is more like a pipe with a 'file'
and a 'blockdevice' as endpoints. Loop isn't historically a good example
of anything, though.
