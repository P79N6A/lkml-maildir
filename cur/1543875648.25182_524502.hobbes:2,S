Hello,
I am currently running 2.6.21-rc5 and I am seeing quite a bit of this
message in my log files:
kernel: rpcsvc: received unknown control message:-2144992132/-1
This machine is an dual dual core opteron with 3Ware 9650 (14 disk
RAID10), 4G RAM, 64bit kernel, nfsutils-1.0.12 running knfsd.  This
machine is a  file server.
I checked google and found nothing that seemed related and I ran a
ethereal looking for anything  out of the ordinary to no avail.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
TIA!
Phy
