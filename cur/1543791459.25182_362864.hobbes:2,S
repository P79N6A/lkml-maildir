Its obvious that if you allocate some-thing (like through
sigqueue_alloc) then you have to free that too (like through
sigqueue_free)

yes, you have to remove the structure explicitly as you allocated it
by your-self ! And I think you can call sigqueue_free just after
calling send_sigqueue because the singals are delivered to the process
with the wake_up call and then you can remove your sigqueue structure
(I might be wrong as I am saying this by just going through the
send_sigqueue function, CMIIW)

I saw one simple way in signal.c file. send_sig function which sends
signal by-itself (means allocate sigqueue internally) see
