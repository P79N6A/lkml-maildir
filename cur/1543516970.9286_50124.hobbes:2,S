Hi Petr,
Thank you for your comments.

I was just unwilling to create a situation where buggy program
writers start blaming totally innocent Linux kernel for "race conditions
in pipe(2) system call". It is obviously up to Linus to decide on which
approach is wiser:
1. total correctness in single-threaded case and allowing broken
multi-threaded programs to break in flames and smoke. (i.e. with my patch)
or
2. conservative approach in single-threaded case but preventing broken
programs from breaking things even worse and in a non-deterministic
manner, i.e. depending on timing of threads scheduling.

Even if he decides not to include the whole patch (it's not in 2.3.30-1)
he can still include the m68k bit because we don't drop the lock there. I
don't know m68k reasons for not dropping the lock.

Tigran.
