this would indicate a pretty broken scheduler. To prove (or exclude)
this possibility, could you apply the attached debugging patch? The
patch checks whether we ever switch away from a still running (and
hence, on-runqueue) RT task to a non-RT task.
(NOTE: dont run this patch on an SMP kernel, the debugging message will
deadlock there due to spinlock recursion.)
