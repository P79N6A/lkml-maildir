It's not horrible, but it's not pretty either.

Did you see my comment about removing all the rsa_ prefixes from the
MPI functions?

You probably want to do it using ntohl.

Well, it probably wants a function call.

Hmmm, odd. I can't find one. There are plenty of things that roll
their own though.

static at the global level marks something as internal to a
compilation unit. We generally put these sorts of private declarations
straight into the .c file.
And we often skip such prototypes entirely if the .c file can be
ordered such that no forward declarations are necessary.
