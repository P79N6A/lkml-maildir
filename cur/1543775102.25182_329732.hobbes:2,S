Certainly needs to be in a separate .h at least ... Also, you have some
lifetime issues. You probably want to do a get() on pci_dev when you put
it in your struct and put() it after the notifier... Oh wait, you are
doing pci_dev_put() ... but no pci_dev_get() ... The later must be
missing from peh_send_failure_event().
I'd keep that in arch code for now.
Ben.
