 Certainly it is, but not necessarily the only one. ;-)

 Well, in PC/AT compatible implementations, the counter #0 of the PIT has
its gate hardwired to active, so you cannot mask the PIT output itself.  
So the only other choices are either reprogramming the counter to a mode
that won't cause periodic triggers (which is probably the easiest way, but
you don't want to do that for some purpose, right?) or reprogramming
interrupt controllers not to accept interrupts arriving from the PIT.
 Note that Linux may behave strangely then. ;-)
