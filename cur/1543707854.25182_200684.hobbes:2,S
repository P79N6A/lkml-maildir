Hi!
I am experiencing choppy sound playback with xmms. For example, when I
keep switching workspaces in my WindowManager, the sound is nearly not
usable. But also during normal work, mp3 playback is somewhat chopy.
This only occurs after I change the scaling_gov. Not after every change
though. If it happens, and I change the scaling gov again, sound
eventually is ok again.
I have a Pentium III 1.13GHz Laptop with a snd_intel8x0 soundchip. The
CPU (should) run at 733Mhz in powersave, so mp3 playback should be ok...
My Kernel is 2.6.2 (haven't tried the new one yet).
regards
Jonas
