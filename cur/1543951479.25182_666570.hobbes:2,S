sure and agreed. And this absolutely has to happen in a separate 
patchset. Unification is done best by not changing much and by delaying 
any difficult change to as late in the unification effort as possible. 
(thus any non-trivial change, if it breaks things and has to be 
reverted, wont pull another 100 "easy" changes with itself)
