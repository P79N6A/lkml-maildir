I figured (maybe incorrectly) that oo was just going thru the dri card*
files:
stat64("/dev/dri", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=80, ...}) = 0
stat64("/dev/dri/card8", 0xbfec2e8c)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
geteuid32()                             = 500
stat64("/dev/dri", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=80, ...}) = 0
stat64("/dev/dri/card9", 0xbfec2e8c)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
geteuid32()                             = 500
stat64("/dev/dri", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=80, ...}) = 0
stat64("/dev/dri/card10", 0xbfec2e8c)   = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
geteuid32()                             = 500
stat64("/dev/dri", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=80, ...}) = 0
stat64("/dev/dri/card11", 0xbfec2e8c)   = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
geteuid32()                             = 500

from 0 to 14 until it found a card that it could use. The root cause
has to be that it can't use dri/card* because of access permissions.
Note, that strace glxgears gives exactly the same output, going from 0 to
14 and then seg-faulting, so it's *not just a oo problem*.
