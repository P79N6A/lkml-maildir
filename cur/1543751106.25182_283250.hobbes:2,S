It's tying privilegues to uids/gids, and it does so in an overcomplicated
way and just for an extremly tiny, specialized subset of available
privilegues.
In short it's a very specialized hack.

I'm very sorry but I don't have the time to comment on every single patch
posted somewhere.  All the review and core kernel work I do on lkml is in my
unpaid spare time.  If you want me to review specific things in a deadline
or want me to implement features in a way that fits the kernel grand plan
(which doesn't equal to it actually beeing accepted by other kernel
developers), you're free to contract me.
