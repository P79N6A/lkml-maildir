^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I'm the one having posted this message.
Andrea Arcangeli made a patch to 2.3.42, its 2.3.42aa2.
I haven't seen the corruption with apt since I'm running 2.3.42aa2 (6 days now)
but debian activity has been slower now that potato is frozen, I've done only
2 upgrades of woody in 6 days.
I would say that previously, apt-get triggered the bug 50 to 70% of the time.
And it's really subjective measurement actually...
At least Andrea's patch didnt break more :-))
Andrea's msg is '2.3.42 fs corruption', dated Fri 4 Feb 2000 17:24:37 +0100 (CET)
Cheers.
