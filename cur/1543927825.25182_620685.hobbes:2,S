"Some architectures are unable to perform unaligned memory accesses, 
either an exception is generated, or the data 
access is silently invalid. In architectures that allow unaligned 
access, natural aligned accesses are usually faster than non-aligned."

Please move this definition before "Why unaligned access is bad".
Also, it would be nice to have a table of ISAs:
ISA		Need		Need
		natural		alignment
		alignment	by x
--------------------------------------------
m68k		No		2
powerpc/ppc	Yes		Word size
x86		No		No
x86_64		No		No
