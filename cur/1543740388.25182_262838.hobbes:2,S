i tried to pole jackd a little bit (just using things like
jack_freewheel and jack_impulse_grabber - i dont even know what they 
do), and got jackd into some sort of userspace loop:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 2558 root      16   0 27900 1852 2152 S 97.8  0.8   2:36.38 jackd
attaching gdb to it shows:
 Loaded symbols for /usr/local/lib/jack/jack_oss.so
 0xffffe410 in ?? ()
 (gdb) bt
 #0  0xffffe410 in ?? ()
 #1  0xbffff7f8 in ?? ()

 (gdb)
it's looping somewhere in the pthread code, and it does no system-calls
at all and thus no scheduling as well.
i dont know much about jackit, and it could easily be that something in
this kernel broke its interaction with pthread, but it seems to me that
this loop is in userspace and is only 'fatal' if the looping thread runs
at SCHED_FIFO priority. Could someone with more jackit experience try to
figure out what's going on here?
