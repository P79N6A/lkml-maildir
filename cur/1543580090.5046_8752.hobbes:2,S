That's the core of the disagreement. I think SGI had some really good
engineers who have worked very hard - but that hard work and good
programming can never compensate for bad design. I think Linux works so
well because it's been designed well -- and good design often means
refusing to go down a path that is known to seemingly invariably
lead to failure. HP-UX, IRIX, Masscomp ... -- all these guys have
tried this "concept" and all have had some sucess, but at a 
very high price.

RTLinux is not intended to be another Linux - one Linux is enough
(and one IRIX is too many!). What 
RTLinux does is, essentially, add a special realtime process to
Linux and let applications in this "process" be written as threads
and signal handlers. The environment is specifically made to be
"restrictive" and programmers are encouraged to put non-realtime 
components in Linux and only put timing critical stuff in the RT
process. So complaining that the RTLinux environment is not 
the Linux environment is rather silly and akin to a complain that
you can't call shell scripts from driver code. Different environments
serve different purposes. The engineering claim behind RTLinux is that
while many attempts to integrate hard realtime into general purpose
OS's have produced large buggy, slow, and compromised OS's, the
RTLinux model provides a simple software design that offers reliable
hard realtime without screwing up the internals of the general
purpose OS. In fact, I argue that it's a mistake to integrate
hard realtime and non-realtime code in applications as well. 
So I think that the argument "we should have hard realtime in 
an integrated environment" is like arguing  "we should have fast cornering,
and instant acceleration in a moving van". If you don't like my 
sports car because it does not come with air brakes and a trailer, 
show me how it's possible to accomplish both design goals: but don't
simply "marketize" about how inferior the sports car is because it
is missing moving van features.
