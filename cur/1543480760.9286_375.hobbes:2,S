I've noticed similar effects on many recent kernels (including 2.2.0.....)
on a 386sx16 with an old Hercules clone video card.  Sometimes I have a
cursor, sometimes I don't, and I haven't detected any patter re reboot
etc..  I suspect a timing problem, i.e. that the cursor may actually be 
"there", just not visible, as often it is just weakly visible.  Since the 
only thing the machine is used for is checking to see if the latest 
release can "make modules" as quickly as 2.0.36, I don't really care too 
much. (So far 2.0.36 on my configuration wins by at least a factor of 3, 
often 10.  Obviously I have swapping problems.)
I might add that this machine hangs in the floating point check in bugs.h 
if I don't comment out a bit, although I doubt if there is any relationship 
between the two problems.  (include/asm-i386/bugs.h line  81 as of 
2.2.0pre8)
