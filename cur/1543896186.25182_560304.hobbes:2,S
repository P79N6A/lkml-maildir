plus, and I repeat myself.. the program comes with no warranties whatsoever.
and if your complains are purely moral, see it this way: if TiVo
didn't sign their kernel, digital cable providers wouldn't give them
their hash keys, and they wouldn't be able to show HD signals,
rendering them useless, and making them go bankrupt... so they'd go
BSD, because they ARE a company after all, and they are after The
Moneys..
