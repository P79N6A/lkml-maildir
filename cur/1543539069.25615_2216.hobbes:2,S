Did you view the message, and then choose "reply", with quoting
turned on?  I'm using PINE 4.21.  What version of PINE are you
using.

Well obviously PINE should not have crashed regardless of the
input it was given - no program should, however since such
postings are rare, I'd consider it a minor PINE bug, although it
may also be a potential security hole.
As for PINE "sucking" as you say... that is nothing more than
opinion.  You use your software, I'll use mine.  I'm not
interested in an MUA war as I don't really give a shit what
mailer someone else uses.

Well that solution has been posted in the past a million
times.  It simply will not happen due to the nature of the list
charter.  The list is ran openly so that non-subscribers can
EASILY post bug reports.  If someone has no choice but to
subscribe in order to post a bug report, they are more likely to
say fuck it, than to post a report.  If they know they'll be
getting anywhere from 50->200 or more messages a day, they'll be
even less likely.
So, the solution often told is "filter it yourself", which is
what I want to try and do.  Just trying to have my mail the way I
like it, without having to install a new OS, new mailer, and
redefine my entire world of computing - thats all.
