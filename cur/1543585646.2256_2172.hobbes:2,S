Exactly. My mistake earlier to assume cramfs was "compressed ramfs"! ;-)
I should compare it to the tar.gz option and JFFS2. Will do in the next 
evaluation.
This will be more of a replace initrd+custom /linuxrc with a 
CRAMFS-based rootfs on a flash device assuming CRAMFS can be directly 
read by kernel\init for getting the rootfs. Ditto for JFFS2
Also, the platform is PPC, IBM 405GP to be precise.
