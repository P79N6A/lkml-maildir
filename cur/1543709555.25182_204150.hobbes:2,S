i think perhaps i need to expound upon what i have a vision of. a kernel mode 
console is just that: a console designed to run in kernel mode. it could have 
built in commands to allow for quick and dirty examination of stuff (anything 
really, like memory dumps) and a command processor for scripted stuff, but 
the true power of it comes in when you issue a command that is not internal 
to the console. it could run a special debugger, an application that installs 
a probe, a memory monitor, etc., etc. in short it is not a debugger per-say, 
but a "god mode" console for the linux kernel. that is what i had a vision 
of. the executables it would run would necessarily be compiled for that. 
again, i ask is that worth the time coding it?
