Well...  That depends :)  For now, I'd prefer to stay out of mainline,
until we're having gcc-trunk with a current GNU libc up'n'running.
Until then, I plan to at least break the complete ABI once (drop old
syscals and _only_ wire up their modern counterparts.)

Sure, but at least mentioning that there's more than only a simple
table of function pointers may or may not help to *plan* the code to
fit future needs.

Any they're already merged. Yay :)
