The warnign was removed for other reasons, I'll re-instate it after 2.6.20 
has been released so that we can resolve all filesystem things (as it is, 
right now, it's not any worse than it ever has been, and the kernel will 
shut up about filesystems doing something strange).
But I think the Reiserfs problem already got fixed, and wouldn't warn any 
more even if the WARN_ON() was still there..
