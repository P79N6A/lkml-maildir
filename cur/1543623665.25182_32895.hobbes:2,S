Yep, clean as in a page of zeroes when you touch it. (DIAGNOSE X'10' as
documented in the "CP Programming Services" manual, to be precise).

We're looking at ways of having fancier memory management information
pass between Linux and CP (it's safer to say CP (the "kernel" part of
VM/ESA and z/VM) than VM, given the ambiguous and confusing dual
meaning of "VM" otherwise :-).

Indeed. A "quich hack" that turns out to have rather useful, fun
properties is to have a little device driver (can be a module) which
stores "negative pages" in the page cache by allocating page cache
pages for the device's inode and then invoking the CP "release page"
call mentioned above. Linux thinks the page is "useful" and so keeps
it around until memory pressure kicks it out whereas the underlying
CP knows it's a hole making the resident size and working set of the
Linux image reduce. Add in a bit of feedback to get Linux re-reading
the "device" into cache proportionally to how much CP wants to kick
*out* resident pages from the image. Fun... However, closer
integration with the main mm system is the "proper" way to do it
(but depends on stuff like the latency, overheads and information
shared with CP so is a little more than an afternoon hack.)
