Parts of it are unique, but some of the same issues crop up in nfs - we
will need a way there as well for nfsd to assume the client process'
label for permission checking and new file labeling purposes, and the
act_as hook is not fundamentally different than what nfsd does today
with the fsuid/fsguid, just applied to the security label.
