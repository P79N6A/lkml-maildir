In the implementation I sent out earlier (I called it -U9.2-priom) I
solved this by releasing all locks before going to the next task in the
dependency chain. This leaves me open to rescheduling in the middle and
some of the tasks could exit before I got to them. To solve this I used
task_get/put() to make sure the task struct doesn't disappeare before the
next lock is taken. All this locking/unlocking, task_get/task_put is
ofcourse an overhead, but besides avoiding one big lock it gives one more
advantage: It decreases the amount of time a spin lock is held, thus
descreasing the penalty to the overall latency.

I think that is a good approach on UP: Disable preemption, do the sorting
etc., enable preempion. On SMP, however, a global lock is not so nice...
However, I am thinking: Fix the bugs in the current implementation, then
try to optimize it.
