Commit 8891fec65ac5b5a74b50c705e31b66c92c3eddeb broke aic7xxx 
compilation:
<--  snip  -->
$ make O=../out/x86-full
...
  SHIPPED drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_seq.h
  SHIPPED drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_reg.h
  CC      drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_core.o
gcc: drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_core.c: No such file or directory
gcc: no input files
make[4]: *** [drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_core.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
Next "make" run brings the same failure in 
drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_core.c.
With the third "make" it works.
It might compile for people with SMP systems using -j?

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
