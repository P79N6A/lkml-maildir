Oliver is right that we cannot allow device_remove_file() to fail.  In 
fact we can't even allow it to block until all the existing open file 
references are closed.
Our major questions have to do with the details of the patch itself.  In 
particular, we are worried about possible races with the VFS and the 
handling of the inode's usage count.  Can you examine the patch carefully 
to see if it is okay?
Also, Oliver, it looks like the latest version of your patch makes an 
unnecessary change to sysfs_remove_file().
