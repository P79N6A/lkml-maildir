Ugh:
Never fork:               stop (expected)
One plain fork:           exit
Two fork, exit, setsid:   ignore
Now that I hate job control...
We still lack a suitable core-dumping signal to use for SIGSYS.
We need this. (We ought to have a core-dumping SIGEMT too.)
We also need to dump core on SIGBUS, SIGXCPU, and SIGXFSZ.
Those that thing we should define SIGSYS and SIGEMT outside the
kernel source on 1/2 the ports have yet to explain how userspace
will make them dump core by default. (and why don't we just remove
those signals from the Alpha and MIPS ports? If they are bad...)
