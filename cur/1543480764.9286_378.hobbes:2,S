Previous kernels had 4 bit master volume controls for all ESS chips.
Most ESS chips have 6 bit master volume controls however, so recent
kernels use these volume controls. There is a difference between the
4bit and the 6bit controls: the former is linear and the latter is
logarithmic. Which means 50% with 6 bits is not as loud as 50% with 4
bits. 100% should be the same for both however.
I checked it on both aES1868 and a ES1887: 100% still is very loud on
both
