The top of the patch in -mm says:
(hch sez:
 There's lots of architectural problems.  It's doing it's own queueing, it's
 stuffing kernel structures into memory on the hardware and so on.  Basically
 someone knowledgeable about the hardware needs to start from scratch on it.
 Unfortunately it seems the hardware is more and more widely available so
 we'll have to bite that bullet one day.)
