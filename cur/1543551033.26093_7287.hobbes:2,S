Please don't, this assumption is quite wrong. I use nice just to be
'nice' to other users. I can run my *important* CPU hog simulation
nice +10 in order to let other people get more CPU when the need it.
But if you put the logic "niced == not important" somewhere into the
kernel, nobody will use nice anymore. I'd rather give a bonus to niced
processes.
I agree this is a small issue, the OOM killer job isn't "nice" at all
anyway. B-) (at OOM time, I'd not even look at the nice of a process at
all. But my point here is that you do, and you take it as an hint for
process importance as percieved by the user that run it, and I believe
it's just wrong guessing).
