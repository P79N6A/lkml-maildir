Hello,
I have update my kernel from 2.2.17 (with USB patch) to kernel 2.4.4. Now,
booting the kernel block for about 5 minutes when configuring lo and eth0.
The original distribution is a RedHat 6.2 on a PIII Dell portable (Inspiron
3800), with a PCMCIA card for the network (NE2000 compatible).
The PCMCIA modules are thoses from pcmcia-cs, and not those in the kernel.
I have updated the major packages (as wrote in Documentation/Changes) :
    - modutils 2.4.1
    - net-tools 1.60
    - pcmcia-cs 3.1.25
    - ...
Also, poweroff the system correctly take about 20 minutes. All work good until
portmap stop. After, all is really slowwwww.
I'm not 100% sure, but it seem starting in single mode, then exit boot without
problems.  I need to re-test this to be sure, but it's not a good solution. ;-)
If anyone has a tip, thanks in advance.
		Olivier
