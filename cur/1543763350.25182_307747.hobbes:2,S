Sorry for the late follow up. Unfortunately, a quick hack to disable the
"pmtmr" check shows that even when "trusting" the PM-Timer, the clock
and interrupts still run 3x too fast. That makes no difference.

Where could I get that patch from ? I'd be glad to do some testing for
you if you need it.

Problem is that the issue shows exactly after one quick power off/power
on sequence. It doesn't show after a real cold start (leaving the laptop
off for a  couple of hours) or even after a reboot.

Not sure if that's the exact same problem. What I can say, after reading
that bug report, is that disabling ACPI and/or APIC makes no difference.
Specifying the clock=... makes no difference either. It doesn't seem
related to the AMD64 part of the kernel since it shows equally when
using a 64bit kernel and a 32bit kernel.
Moreover, when that bug shows, there are other different problems
showing (such as the cdrom not being to mount anything, or ndiswrapper
crashing the system with a MCE error).
At first, I thought the issue might be related to the nforce3, but the
bug refers to an ATI chipset so I guess it's not related to the nforce.
Anyway, it doesn't seem to be an uncommon issue with AMD64 based
hardware. I don't know where to start from though.
Cheers,
Olivier.
