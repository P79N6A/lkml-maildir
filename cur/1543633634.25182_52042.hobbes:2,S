Thanks, I'll give it a try... Will I experience any problems trying to
get XFS into this kernel as well?  I start with 2.4.18 to patch to the
pre* series, correct?  (I'm not used to running bleeding edge...)  I'm
guessing the order would be:
2.4.18 (stock)
+XFS
+.19pre10
+pre10ac2

CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX=y  (at least in the problematic kernel, this
enables the subdriver itself)
CONFIG_PDC202XX_BURST=y,n  (I've tried both, neither helps)
CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE=n    (I read that this is for FastTrak
controllers, I only have an Ultra100)
Thanks, I'll try this when I get home!
