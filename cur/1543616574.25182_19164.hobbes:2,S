Arguably this is the most extreme situation - every other distribution
(2:3, 3:4) is much less problematic. Will this cause problems? We could
make the fairness-balancer more 'sharp' so that it will oscillate the
length of the two runqueues at a slow pace, but it's still caching loss.

indeed. The question is, should we migrate processes around just to get
100% fairness in 'top' output? The (implicit) cost of a task migration
(caused by the destruction & rebuilding of cache state) can be 10
milliseconds easily on a system with big caches.
