Hi,
I am having a problem with memory leaking on a patched kernel.  In order 
to pinpoint the leak, I would like to try to trace the allocation points 
for the memory.
I have found some vague references to patches that allow the user to 
dump the caller address for slab allocations, but I cannot find the 
patch itself.
Can anybody please point me in the right direction - either for that 
patch, or any other way to track down leaking slabs?
Thank you,
Justin Schoeman
