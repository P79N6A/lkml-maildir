That's fine with me, that within the same priority-queue any task can be 
chosen. But assume two tasks with highly different priorities, such as 
105 and 135 are scheduled on the same processor and one of them is now 
to be migrated -- shouldn't be the queue with task P=105 considered 
first for migration by this code?
Both tasks would use different queues with their own linked lists, right?
