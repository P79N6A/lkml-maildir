Yes, I am planning to add something like this.  Whether it needs to be
per path, or we could get away per priority group is probably a
question that you could answer better than me ?  Do we need a
corresponding deactivate for some hardware ?

I think the bio recording/reset is going to have to move inside the

that incurs this overhead.  So yes, there will have to be a wrapper
which could be used to provide context for the ps.
