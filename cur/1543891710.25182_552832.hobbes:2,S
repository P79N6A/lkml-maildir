Yes, we'd also prefer to use a generic function, but we first would want to
get
some "real world" experience how our driver behaves with LRO to be even
able to
define requirements for such a generic function. A lot of this is tied into
pathlengths,
caching, and why does that help compared to a different TCP receive side
processing?
In a perfect world we shouldn't see a diffference if this is enabled or
not,
but measurements indicate something completely different at 10gbit.
