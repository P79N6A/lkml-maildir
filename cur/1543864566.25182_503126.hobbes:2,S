Ah, OK. Thanks for the exhaustive search and explanation. This explains
why Alan and Nick disagreed on the device number.

Yes, this sounds like the right thing to do. So here comes the third
(and hopefully last) iteration of the patch:
Fix VIA quirks that were recently broken by Alan Cox in the upstream
kernel (commit 1597cacbe39802d86656d1f2e6329895bd2ef531).
My understanding is that pci_find_present() doesn't work yet at the
time the quirks are run. So I used a two-step quirk as is done for
some other quirks already. First we detect the VIA south bridges
and set the right low and high device limits, then we are ready to
actually run the quirks on the affected devices.
