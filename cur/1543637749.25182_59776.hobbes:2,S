32-bit is a sad, broken, and depressing reality we're going to be
saddled with on mainstream systems for ages. It's stinking up the
kernel like a dead woodchuck under the porch as it is, and the 64GB
abominations on their way out the ass-end of hardware vendor pipelines
are truly vomitous.

This is so aggressive I'm obligated to pursue it. The pte_chain will
die shortly if I get my way as it is.
