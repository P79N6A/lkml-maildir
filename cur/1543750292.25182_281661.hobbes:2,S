Thanks, I'll check that out.
I believe that you didn't test the sparc64 build of the infiniband stuff
because arch/sparc64/Kconfig needs to explicitly include the infiniband
Kconfig since it does not use drivers/Kconfig.  You didn't send me any
such changes.
There are a few platforms which also are in this situation.
I added the sparc64 one to my tree while integrating your changes,
but the others need to be attended to if you wish infiniband to
be configurable on them.
