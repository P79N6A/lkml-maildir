Thank you for posting this, wli.

Just thinking... this little bit is actually a bug even on UP sans
kernel preemption, too, since oom_kill() can sleep.  If it sleeps, and
another process enters out_of_memory(), 'now' and 'first' will be out of
sync.
So I think this patch is a Good Thing in more ways than the obvious SMP
or kernel preemption issue.
