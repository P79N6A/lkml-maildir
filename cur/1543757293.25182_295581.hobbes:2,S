Usually distro binaries are dynamically linked (as they should be) so 
you also need to provide the libraries they request.
As a first cut, use bash as your init (so that you have a prompt to test 
stuff). Do a "ldd bash" to check the libraries necessary for this to 
work and create a "/lib" dir on your target system with those. Then copy 
the bash binary to /sbin/init.
I hope this helps,
