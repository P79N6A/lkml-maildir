Unfortunately there's not much information here in your mail or
there that would help us to analyse this further.  If you see this
behaviour again could you:
- get sysrq-t information for all hung processes, esp. mount;
- send xfs_info output for the filesystem in question;
- dump the log (xfs_logprint -C) and send it to us.

This was probably caused by the block device being held open
exclusively by the stuck mount process.

Thats unlikely to help now - repair will have wiped your log clean,
so all evidence of the problem will be gone.
cheers.
