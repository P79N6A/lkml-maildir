I'm not talking about Roman at all here.  Quoting the relevant message:

I'm sure it's not the actual developer cost which is in cause here.
Larry turned it down with the usual "we're'll fear you if we do that" 
answer although I still have problems seeing why BK would be suplented 
with that info available.  The SCM problem is much much more than just a 
tree to bench test on.
So if Larry could realize that he has nothing to fear even if that info 
is available to the competition, he might even spend less time debating 
this stupid topic over and over and dedicate his time to more rentable 
activities, actually making more money as a result.
