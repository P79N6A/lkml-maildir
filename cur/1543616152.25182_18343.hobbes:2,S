Yes.  The important part is the implicit dropping of the BKL across
schedule().

Nope.  `if (current->need_resched)' -> the time is right (beyond right,
actually).

Except it doesn't work.  The full-on low-latency patch has ~60 rescheduling
points.  Of these, ~40 involve popping spinlocks.  Really, the only significant
latency sources which the preemptible kernel solves are generic_file_read()
and generic_file_write().
So preemptible kernel needs lock-break to be useful.  And then it's basically
the same thing, with the same maintainability problems.  And believe me, these
are considerable.  Mainly because the areas which needs busting up exactly
coincide with the areas where there has been most churn in the kernel.

Latency yes.  Throughout no.
I don't think the "preempt slows down the kernel" argument is very valid
really.  Let's invert the argument - Linux is multitasking, and that has a
cost.  There's no reason why certain bits of the kernel need to violate that
just to get a bit more throughput.  If it really worries you, set HZ=10 and
increase all the timeslices, etc.
Now, there *may* be overheads added due to losing the implicit locking which
per-CPU data gives you.
The main cost of preempt IMO is in complexity and stability risks.
(BTW: I took a weird oops testing the preempt patch on an SMP NFS client.
The fault address was 0x0aXXXXXX.  No useful backtrace, unfortunately).

There's no point in just merging the preempt patch and saying "there,
that's done".  It doesn't do anything.
Instead, a decision needs to be made: "Linux will henceforth be a 
low-latency kernel".  Now, IF we can come to this decision, then
internal preemption is the way to do it.  But it affects ALL kernel
developers.  Because we'll need to introduce a new rule: "it is a
bug to spend more than five milliseconds holding any locks".
So.  Do we we want a low-latency kernel?  Are we prepared to mandate
the five-millisecond rule?   It can be done, but won't be easy, and
we'll never get complete coverage.  But I don't see the will around
here.
