It shouldn't be too painful.  The code to populate /proc/*/fd/ has the
file struct.  It just doesn't have a place pass the offset to user-space
since it's basically creating a symlink.  In proc_fd_link(), it has the
file struct.  The offset is file->f_pos.
One could create something like /proc/*/fd_offsets, whose read method
could list the file descriptor, path, and offset for each open file.
