Yeah - they are already defined, and used in other macros in system.h - 
which is why I put the macro there.

OK - I was just doing the similar thing to what already exists in 
./asm-blackfin/system.h
#define local_irq_enable() do {         \
         __asm__ __volatile__ (          \
                 "sti %0;"               \
                 ::"d"(irq_flags));      \
} while (0)
which could be simplified to:
#define local_irq_enable() __asm__ __volatile__ ("sti %0;" ::"d"(irq_flags));
which is the same as what is in ./asm-i386/system.h - isn't it?
#define local_irq_disable()     __asm__ __volatile__("cli": : :"memory")
#define local_irq_enable()      __asm__ __volatile__("sti": : :"memory")
We can do it anyway that makes sense/improves readability - it all compiles 
to the same thing...
