Yes. The IA32 ABI says the FPU registers are clobbered in a function
call. And fork is a function call. Same with the SSE registers.
Unfortunately it is much more expensive to save individual registers
(SSE and x87 stack) than to just save everything using FXSAVE. 
FXSAVE uses lazy saving and saves only the x87 registers that are
actually uses.
For SSE registers it may make sense, but then FXSAVE does that already
too and you always have to handle the x87 register stack too.
I doubt it would be a good idea to not use FXSAVE on i386. The microcode
can do a better job here because it has more information. In addition
it also promises to handle future new Intel registers transparently.
x86-64 ABIs have similar semantics.
