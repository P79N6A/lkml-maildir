Well... With RTLinux, they could even work reliably. And "Linux can
handle yet another situation where other OSes fail" sounds kind of good.
;-)
However, that doesn't mean I like the idea of "type 1 modems", except in
the very special case you want to use a few in a digital switchboard or
something like that. And what an ugly hack, demanding hard real time
capabilities for a low bandwidth communication device! Smells
"prototyping toolkit"...
But OTOH, if [LW]inModems can work reliably, and you don't need all CPU
power anyway, then yes, perhaps their existence can be justified, at
least in low cost, turn-key systems.
