Well it seems that it is not included in 
http://www.urbanmyth.org/microcode/
So I would recommend getting it from some BIOS from other vendor. You will need 
to decompress the BIOS and get the microcode from there. If you will find some 
BIOS for Core duo ntbk I might help with that. Just send me a URL for download 
and I will try to dig it out (with some luck there will be some update ;)
