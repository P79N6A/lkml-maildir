hm, OK, so this should be a no-op for non-NUMA setups.
Prior to merging such a change it would be nice to have confirmed
before-and-after testing on real NUMA hardware.  Rather than saying "gee,
this should help", but never knowing how much it really did help.
Could you suggest a suitable worklaod for Andi and Martin to test sometime?
Meanwhile, I'll mmify it for a bit of soak testing, thanks.
