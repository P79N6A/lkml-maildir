Hello to all,
I've got this problem since kernel 2.2.2 though  I am not 100% sure
about de sublevel number .
Anyhow I am still experiencing this nasty thing while running kernel
2.2.7.
It doesn't show up all the time. I often have to reboot a couple of
times before this problem seems to have disappeared.
I'd like to give you any information needed to get this thing fixed!
Regards,
John Donath
