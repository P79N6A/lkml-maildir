I don't think hot swapping is an issue for most people today.  Since most
laptops have internal CDROMs and what-not, they don't need to worry about
using external stuff that would require a PC card.  Most people with
laptops will have an ethernet card and/or a modem, which they can use both
at the same time, or even get them on the same card.
And while NT by itself doesn't support hot swapping, hot swapping is
possible under NT.  (Mmmmm... love that proprietary Dell software.)
