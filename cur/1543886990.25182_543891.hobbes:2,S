I took a more careful look than with recent -gitXX, and
 for reporting's sake here's a few MODPOST warnings:
  MODPOST vmlinux
WARNING: init/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:
from .text between 'rest_init' (at offset 0xfd) and 'try_name'
WARNING: mm/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:
from .text between 'kmem_cache_create' (at offset 0x196e4) and
'cache_reap'
WARNING: mm/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:
from .text between 'kmem_cache_create' (at offset 0x19716) and
'cache_reap
Grepping in my recent kernel build logs, the rest_init one
 seems to be present since -git7 but wasn't in -git6.
Googling around seems that this has already been looked
 into in the 2.6.20-rc series, with patches that may or may
 not have made it into mainline.
I still have old .config files, so if there's anything useful I
 can do to provide more info, just holler.
ciao,
