If you want to do a popularity contest I expect there are far more ia64 
linux users than kexec-of-openbsd users.

One interesting area is to use it for saving oops data. But
that has to be simple. I'm not sure complicated context switches
are a good idea here. 
However I agree it probably doesn't make sense to do virtual
mode just for the clock services -- so far we seem to be fine
just talking to the hardware directly.

I don't think it's a big issue to have a few less NX bits. Just
the original patch for it was ugly.

So you want to switch to new page tables when calling EFI services
after boot? 
Potential problems:
- Interrupts have to be disabled. Is that ok? 
- When EFI BIOS start crashing how do we set up exception handlers
for this? 
I guess it would get complex long term. Also doesn't really sound 
attractive.
