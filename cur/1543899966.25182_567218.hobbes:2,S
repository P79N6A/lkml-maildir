Something simple you can do, which I didn't see mentioned yet:
look up the entries before and after c01ace66 in that 2.6.20
kernel's System.map, then post the output of
objdump -d --start-address=0xbefore --stop-address=0xafter vmlinux
so people here can see the function name and the oopsing instruction
in its context.  May not help at all, but well worth trying.
