unsigned long do_mmap_pgoff(struct file * file, unsigned long addr, unsigned 
long len,
        unsigned long prot, unsigned long flags, unsigned long pgoff)

        [local var defs snipped]

So,
-	if ((len = PAGE_ALIGN(len)) == 0)
-		return addr;
-	if (len > TASK_SIZE)
+	if (!len)
+		return addr;
+	len = PAGE_ALIGN(len);
+	if (!len || len > TASK_SIZE) /* !len: address wrapped to 0 in ALIGN */

Looks like you found an obscure corner case. Good!

Do it.
BTW, does anybody know why len==0 is not flagged as error?
