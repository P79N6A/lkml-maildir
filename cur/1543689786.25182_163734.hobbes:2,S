I didn't read this in time to get this tested - I did a full backup and 
restore earlier, zeroing all sectors on both drives. All is fine now, 
however I have no idea how this has happened. I'll set one partition 
faulty, re-add it and reboot later just to make sure it really works.
2.6 has never been booted on that machine, or disks.
Thanks, I'll keep mdadm in mind next time something like this happens ;-)
