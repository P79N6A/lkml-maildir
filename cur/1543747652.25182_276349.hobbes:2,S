We saw this on ppc64 on earlier 2.6 kernels. There were some bugs with
the VM where interrupts would get disabled for a long time (we saw 20+
second periods). A SCSI timeout would occur on another CPU and at that
time irqs would get reenabled and 20 seconds of time would get replayed.
A bunch of timers would go off early and the SCSI adapter would explode.
