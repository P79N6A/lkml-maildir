Unfortunately, providing updates to Redhat even in a timely manner has
no impact on whether or not these udpates are incorporated into recent
releases.

Getting website updates is a slow and painful process at Adaptec.
I've been working on this for some time, but have not yet had any
success.  That is why I distribute the most recent drivers from
a location I can control.

That would depend on the device.  For Adaptec aic7xxx and aic79xx drivers,
you can use the site I provided.

I don't know enough about your problem to be able to say.  There have
been lots of fixes to these drivers over their lifetime, so upgrading
is a good first step.
