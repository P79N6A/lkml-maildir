Hi all,
A 'nanny patch' to stop probable confusion over the two RTC options.  I needed 
access to /dev/rtc and not knowing where the option was in menuconfig, I 
selected the wrong one first.  I was confused on the help of the this RTC, 
but it didn't cross my mind once there was another RTC 'option' available, 
and so wasted a build and reboot only to see it was wrong.
Hopefully this will aid to stop that confusion.
Nick

 	  Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will
  	  be allowed to plug one or more RTCs to your system. You will
 	  probably want to enable one of more of the interfaces below.
