Jeff & Tejun thanks *a lot* for clarifying this. I am quite happy to see
that this is working very reliably!

OK, but then this really should be in the SATA hotplug FAQ (or can one
fix this somehow?)... No user will ignore messages like this. What is
especially annoying is that udev on the first remove/insert cycle
created a new device node so the disk became /dev/sde (was /dev/sdd):
dmesg output of reinserting the disk 2 times follows:
<remove /dev/sdd>
