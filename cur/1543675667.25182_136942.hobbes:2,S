On a P4/533-2.4Ghz/512MB with udma5 IDE ~50MB/s:
Shows severe interactivity problems and hangs
Scroll and mouse hangs and delayed response to keyboard 
greater 1s are easily observable.
Test script: tstinter V0.1

To reproduce cd to dir with script and execute from X console: 
  ./tstinter start
More instructions in script
