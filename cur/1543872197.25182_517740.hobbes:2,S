For APICs, we have two operations - APICRead and APICWrite.  It is nice 
and clean, and plugs in very easily to the APIC accessors available in 
Linux.
Is this not clean?
We just don't drive the local timer interrupts through the APIC, we make 
hypercalls to schedule local timer alarms.  Which is something we must 
do for UP kernels as well, which use the PIT / PIC.  So there is a need 
for having clockevents code which doesn't program timers through the APIC.
So we have one separate time device, independent from the traditional 
hardware timers, and we just program that.  This design is not very 
complex, nor is it unclean, IMHO.
