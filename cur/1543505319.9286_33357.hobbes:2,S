It certainly *behaves* that way; whether or not it is a guarantee is a
good question (I suspect it doesn't, since there is probably a
nonempty set of binary formats -- which doesn't include ELF -- for
which that cannot be guaranteed); although one way to force its hand
is to use dedicated ELF sections for the things that have to come
first or last.
