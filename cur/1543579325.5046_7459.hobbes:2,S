At least for your own implementation of SIOCPUSH has "1" among
arguments of push_pending_frames, so that this does not happen. 8)8)
The second thing, which makes argument above wrong is that
both classic Nagle and linux-2.4 Nagle (extended by Minshall),
do not have this problem. Your argument applies to buggy flavor
of nagling specific to 2.2.
However, SIOCPUSH really affects latency badly in some curcumstances.
Actually, Ingo already learned this from bad experience with TUX. 8)
Namely, when push cannot push anything due to congestion window
or receiver window, http/1.0 style synchronous connections suffer.
The lesson is that when reply is better to be disabled.
