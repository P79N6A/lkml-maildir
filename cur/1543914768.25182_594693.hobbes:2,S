Everyone knows that there are some issues even some internal
ones which I'm not part of.
Not sure if you met some other kernel developers recently, all you
can hear is "those crazy media guys" (which just includes everyone
who works with media related drivers)

This is a free world you can write whatever you want,
but if you want me to change my code you need to
convince me that I should acknowlidge your ideas.
And by not acknowlidging my requirements don't expect
that I will go back to the start and try to reinvent the
wheel. After almost 2 years I'm quite into those things
and I know what I want for my project and what I'll try
to achieve with what I'm doing.
