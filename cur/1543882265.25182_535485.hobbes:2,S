If the result is fixing things which then don't get fixed in mainline, 
as Adrian notes, then there is something wrong with the process, and why 
will people bother to work on stable if they have doubts that there will 
be long term benefit.
With all the effort the regressions list takes and the stable group puts 
into fixes, someone in charge should insist that regressions fixed in 
stable be fixed in mainline. Since there's only one "someone in charge" 
of policy, I think that's a reasonable commitment to the people doing 
the work.
