It was a dark and stormy night.  Suddenly "Peter T. Breuer" <ptb@it.uc3m.es> spoke:

Two basic choices here:
1) Allocate the buffer in kernel space and use the mmap() method to give the
user-space program access to it; and
2) Allocate the buffer in you user application program and use the KIOBUF method
to give the kernel and/or hardware access to your buffer.  Look in
<linux/iobuf.h> for kernel-level inspiration.
