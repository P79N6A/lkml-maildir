yes, those criteria match.
Does it work for the memset way of setting stuff? does the
debuginterface catch this, too, for you?
<memset+14>: repz stos %al,%es:(%edi)
an other idea (by erikm) was that virutal and physical address
mode is mixed up. how do i find out which one is used by kdb and the
debug interface of the cpu? do i need to convert, somehow?
Or is something else wrong with what i do?
During bootup i am dumped into the debugger because my breakpoint funktion was reached:
TTY 7: ef8f8000
&FLIP.char_buf_ptr: ef8f8168
Instruction(i) breakpoint #0 at 0xc016d428 (adjusted)
0xc016d428 tty_kdb_bp:         int3
Entering kdb (current=0xef90c000, pid 28) due to Breakpoint @ 0xc016d428
kdb> md 0xef8f8168 1
0xef8f8168 ef8f8574 00000000 00000000 00000000   t..ï............
kdb> bpha 0xef8f8168 dataw 1

0xef8f8168 ef8f8574 00000000 00000000 00000000   t..ï............
kdb> go
And after bootup is complete, i press Ctrl-A and am dumped into the debugger:
Entering kdb (current=0xc02f6000, pid 0) due to Keyboard Entry
kdb> md 0xef8f8168 1
0xef8f8168 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000   ................
kdb> bl

    is enabled globally adjust 1
Forced Data Write BP #1 at 0xef8f8168

so something overwrote the address, but i got no feedback on it.
