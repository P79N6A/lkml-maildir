The problem, as I understand it, is that gcc-2.96 handles language 
constructs slightly different than older compilers.  This is a preprocessor 
change, not an optimization problem.
To say "new optimizations ... kernel ... unprepared" is incorrect.  Having 
worked with compilers (some years ago), I always took it as an article of 
faith that the same answer(s) would be generated whether optimization was 
turned on or not.  Optimization should always be a way to do a task either 
quicker (fewer instructions executing, less executing time, etc) or shorter 
(less memory needed for the instructions).  Optimization should never, 
never give a different result.  Having new optimizations break an executing 
program is simply wrong.
