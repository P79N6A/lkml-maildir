   it's DiamondMax 9 (manufactured june 13 2003), those had only one 
year warranty so unfortunately I can't return it (just checked it on 
maxtor.com).
   trying to write to it (cat /dev/hdb6 > /dev/sda) but getting exactly 
same messages (ATA: abnormal status 0x59 on port 0xE407). Looks like the 
drive does not respond to anything at all (I tried to turn off computer 
completely, even disconnecting it (while powered off)).
here's the full set of messages (the same set repeats every 30s or so):
