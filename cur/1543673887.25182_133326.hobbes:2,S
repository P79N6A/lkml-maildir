I was originally looking at the 82731FB (PIIX) / 82731SB (PIIX3) datasheet
which does not have over current inputs and has bits 11..10
labelled as reserved (but read value is not specified).
The lspci show the device on the Netserver to be
the 82731AB/EB/MB (PIIX4). This datasheet shows 2 over current
inputs OC[1..0] and defines PORTSC bits:
11 - over current indicator change (1=changed, 0=not changed)
10 - over current indicator state (1=over current, 0=normal)
If bit 10 is set then the documentation says the port is disabled.
Which triggers the erratum and false resume signals.
As you say, the PIIX3 does not specify that the reserved bits
will necessarily read 0, then I guess some other method
is needed to indicate these bits are significant. Or maybe
some other document does specify that the reserved bits
must be zero if not used? The PCI ID should differentiate
between the controllers.
