That previous entry of MAINTAINERS raised an eyebrow too.
You, Eric, Andi, and Zach seem to have done more work on 'i386 BOOT CODE'
in the last few months than I recall Riley doing, well.. since ages.
Not to belittle whatever work he did, but perhaps his entry belongs
more in CREDITS than MAINTAINERS.  It felt a little cheeky to be
messing with someone elses entry though.  Riley?
Perhaps those two entries should just be merged together to become
"i386 Architecture" too ?
