Thanks, and that would do it, it  makes sense why it was the irq patch
that caused problems.  I had forgotten about the number of stubs issue.
I had to clean that up on x86_64 as well and it probably makes most sense
to put that cleanup as well, so we have a small fixed number of stubs
which would make the includes not matter.
Bleh.  Hopefully soon.
