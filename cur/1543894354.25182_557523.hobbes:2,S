It seems to work very well in practice though.

Perhaps there is no benefit in permitting "Tivoization".  But at the
same time, perhaps there are benefits in not preventing "Tivoization" in
ways that may or may not be foreseen at this time.

Tivo has provided some code changes and improvements to Linux.  If they
had been totally unable to use Linux due to the license, they would
probably have used vxworks or BSD or something else, and Linux would
have gotten nothing back.  So the Linux source code improved and other
systems using the linux code base got better as a result.

Users of the Tivo hardware would be able to do more, sure, but then
again, actualyl, maybe not.  After all if it ran vxworks or bsd, the
user still wouldn't be able to do anything about it.  The end result is
the same.  The answer is also still the same: Don't buy a tivo if you
want to change what it does, because it doesn't let you do that.
