One worry I had about releasing git-1.5.0-rc2-1.rpm and friends
just like the "official" ones was that people might have scripts
to automate downloading & updating of packages, and they may not
like to get "beta" installed for them.
I wonder if kernel.org machines are also affected...

I think we could have gone either way (as you said, it is
probably a bit too late to discuss this), but it should probably
be Ok to stay at 1.X as long as these one-way-street format
updates are turned off by default.
And the above happened way before this round and people have
hopefully been happily using.  For example, v1.4.2 was done
early August 2006.
