The intent is to fix them.  Allowing more than 2G of dirty data to
float about seems unreasonable, and it pins buffer_heads.
But hey.  The patch merely sets the initial value of /proc/sys/vm/dirty*,

On the contrary.

I don't have enough RAM to reproduce this.  Please send
call traces up from out_of_memory().
