i asked about the class issue previously specifically for this bus
driver and was told that they werent really fully defined ... the
on-chip I2C interface on the Blackfin chip can handle any I2C device
which is why i added this line
any examples of how to go about doing it via boards ?  i dont see any
other I2C bus driver doing it that way ...
