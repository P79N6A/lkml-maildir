I'm trying to use the internal ethernet system on an m68k machine
as a router system.  I'd like to use the single SONIC NIC as both the
external and internal adaptors.
With aliasing and masquerading, this is easy to do on my i386 box, but 
is proving quite difficult on m68k.
I've compiled a 2.2.10 kernel with the proper support.  Attempts to
bind the main interface to my external IP are successful.  Binding the
secondary interface fails as follows:
# ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.1.1 up
SIOCIFADDR: Operation not supported by device
SIOCIFFLAGS: Operation not supported by device
SIOCIFFLAGS: Operation not supported by device
I think this means the SONIC driver is having problems bringing up the 
second interface.
Any ideas what I can do to fix this situation?  Are the driver's
simply incapable of supporting an aliased interface?  Where can I find
examples of whats required (so I can patch the drivers, perhaps)?
Any help would be greatly appreciated,
-Brian Kidder
