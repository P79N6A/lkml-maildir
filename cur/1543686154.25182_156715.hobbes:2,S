This is not meaningful.
A general kind of convention is that a pointer will be NULL either
by mistake, when it is uninitialized, or on purpose, when no object
is present or no action (other than the default) needs to be performed.
But that general idea is broken by container_of(), which just subtracts
a constant. So, one should check before subtracting that the pointer
is non-NULL. Checking afterwards is meaningless.
