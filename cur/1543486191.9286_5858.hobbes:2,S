... then it continues with touching 90% of the ext2fs code. Linus might
not have seen the code but the point is i think obvious: we do _not_ want
to touch production-level filesystem code. Not, never, ever. Even if this
causes source code bloat for a transition period, but this is how we can
handle these two conflicting constraints: stability and advance. If ext3fs
enters production stage and we have solved the last migration headaches
can we integrate them again. Or just delete the ext2 tree.
