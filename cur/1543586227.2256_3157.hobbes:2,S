the inline keyword was not added into the c language until the ansi/iso
c99 revision, echoing its use in c++.  prior to that time, gcc supplied
__inline__ as a vendor extension simulating this behavior which could be
compiled without violating checks for strict ansi conformance. 
with the new ansi standard, this use of __inline__ is no longer
necessary, although for gcc to grok it as legal ansi requires (iirc) the
macro _ISOC99_SOURCE_ must be defined.
