As an update, this machine eventually ended up dieing pretty horribly. When 
we found it, there were 100's of procs stuck in D state, and our automated 
"ping" script was reporting all sorts of problems. Anyway we killed off as 
many processes as possible, and did a sysreq-t before trying to reboot. The 
soft reboot failed, and a hard reboot was required.
The newly gathered sysreq output has been placed in the files 
sysreqdmesg3.txt and sysreqmsglog3.txt here:
