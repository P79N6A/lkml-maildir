       Linus Torvalds,  the  creator of the  world's  second most
       common Operating System, Linux, will soon become the owner
       of the world's largest software company, Microsoft.
       William Gates, the present CEO of Microsoft, announced today
       that because of  an  accounting  error in  Microsoft  Money,
       a program developed and distributed by Microsoft,  it became
       possible for  an outsider to  gain control of the company by
       acquiring a negative amount of outstanding stock.
       Through his attorney,  Melvin Beli,  Linus announced  that he
       had no intention of selling his  negative shares of Microsoft
       stock which caused the  accounting overflow.  As soon  as  he
       is able  to  take  a  short leave-of-absence  from  Transmeta,
       Linus plans to move the Redmond operation to Afghanistan.
