If someone has Linux and NetWare dual booted on a system, and does not 
fill out the CHS fields properly for NetWare partitions, When NetWare 
boots, it will wipe the partition table (it will ask you first) and 
will not recognize any of the partitions.  It does this because if it 
sees CHS values it does not expect, it assumes the partition table 
has been corrupted.
