Okay, fine with me.  My only concern is that Alan Cox's excellent ideas for
a more general capability might get lost.  But I don't want to stop anyone
from writing khttpd -- and I couldn't if I did want to.  I'm just giving an
opinion on how useful it will be, in hopes that my thoughts may be useful.
