As a follow up to this, I downloaded and installed modutils and module init
tools, the latest versions available on kernel.org, did:
./configure
make all install
And I still get the same error as I was getting before. Is there somewhere
else I'm supposed to be looking, or did I miss a step building modutils and
module init tools?
