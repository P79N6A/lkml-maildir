Ah. On a side not, could you drop a quick hint as to how
screen_info.lfb_size is obtained?
In older (or just different?) versions of vesafb, the video_size was
actually computed by multiplying xres, yres, and the bpp.

I thought the yres_virtual was computed based on how much video_ram was
being used, so all of it _is_ being used, for scrollback?
