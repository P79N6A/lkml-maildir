How much of a problem is this, would it make more sense to make the
termios locking also include a semaphore to serialize driver side events
and not the spin lock ?
We need some kind of locking there otherwise multiple parallel termios
setters resulting in truely strange occurences because driver authors
don't think about 64 parallel executions of ->change_termios()
I can switch the lock around if you want.
