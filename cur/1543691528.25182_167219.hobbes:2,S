Can you explain why profiling dynamically generated code needs kernel
support? The kernel should not know anything about this.
The original oprofile patch also added similar hooks, but they were
not merged. Instead the "dcookies" mechanism was added to assign samples to 
specific executables. Why can't you use the same mechanism? 
There is not more information in the kernel than what dcookies 
already provide.
