Extract from the syslog of a user trying to use a Netgear WG511 with the 
prism54.org drivers in a Dell SmartStep 250N:
Nov 18 15:14:52 rumsfeldsux kernel: cs: cb_alloc(bus 4): vendor 0x1260, device 0x3890
Nov 18 15:14:52 rumsfeldsux kernel: PCI: Enabling device 04:00.0 (0000 -> 0002)

Nov 18 15:14:53 rumsfeldsux default.hotplug[1870]: ======= START HOTPLUG FOR PID 1870 =======
Nov 18 15:15:03 rumsfeldsux kernel: prism54: request_firmware() failed for 'isl3890'
Nov 18 15:15:03 rumsfeldsux kernel: eth1: could not upload firmware ('isl3890')
We got a similar report from someone using the same card in an Asus 
Pundit, and another from someone using a D-Link DWL-g650 A1 in a 
Gericom notebook.
Telling the users to
echo 100 >/proc/driver/firmware/timeout
and try again fixed it for all of them.
All 3 are using Ark Linux Dockyard, meaning 2.4.23-rcsomething-pacwhatever 
with a couple of extra patches and a fairly recent userland hotplug.
Due to lack of hardware I haven't yet figured out what the exact problem 
is (I'm suspecting either the prism54 driver takes forever to handle the 
firmware, or the hotplug scripts cause delays where they shouldn't), but 
increasing the timeout definitely solves the problem for our users.
