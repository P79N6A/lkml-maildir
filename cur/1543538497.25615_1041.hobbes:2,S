Please remember that "once a week" is pretty vague. "once a week"
during what load, with what variance, ...
Suppose Linux will, once every now and then have 
5 millisecond latency 10 times over a 2 minute period, but then go
"typically" three weeks before going over 4 milliseconds. Is that ok?

There is a good reason why Linux and other kernels as designed to be
non-preemptive. To allow preemption, you must introduce locks around
all critical data structures and these locks both can cause bugs and 
certainly add overhead -- especially in today's highly cached processors.
