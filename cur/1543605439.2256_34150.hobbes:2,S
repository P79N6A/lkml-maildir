Like, say it, "thou shalt not dereference user-supplied pointers for verily,
copy_from_user() is there for purpose"?
Or "tons of blind sprintf() calls can really ruin your day when you overflow
the buffer"?
Or that checking the values of arguments, while a noble thing, should
be done _before_ you use them?
Or, say it, one about meaning of
        if ((count == 1) && !(buffer[0] & ~('0' | '1'))) {
not being the same as
        if (count == 1 && (buffer[0] == '0' || buffer[0] == '1')) {
Darn that Ritchie guy - he should've documented that stuff.  Oh, wait -
he had actually done that...
Please, learn C.  Then learn some basic stuff about kernel programming.
Then feel free to start mouthing off.
As for the version in -ac and maintaining it - sure I will.
