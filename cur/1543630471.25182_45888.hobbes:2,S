But how to avoid system hangs due to running out of memory?
Is there a safe guide line? Generally slow is tolerable, but
crash is not.
Thanks,

Ehm, the acenic author is me ;-)
The default value is what all sockets are assigned on open, you can
adjust this using SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF, however the values you set
cannot exceed the [rw]mem_max values. Basically if you set the default
to 4MB, your telnet sockets will have a 4MB default limit as well
which may not be what you want (not saying it will use 4MB).
Thus, set the _max values and use SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF to set the
per process values. But leave the _default values to their original
setting.

It depends on your application, number of streams, general usage of
the connection etc. There's no perfect-for-all magic number.
