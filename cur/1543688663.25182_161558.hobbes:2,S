Lots of people have problems with KT400 chipsets and ACPI. A mr. Quincey
is busy devising a patch, and according to his last post at the
acpi-support mailinglist from sourceforge, things are getting better.
There are also several bugs postet at bugzilla.kernel,org.
So either wait, or join acpi-support and read more there.
Hope this helps,
Jurriaan
