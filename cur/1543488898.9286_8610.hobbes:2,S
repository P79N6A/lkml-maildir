Hello,
Thanks for your answer!
Could I ask you if you think that the two patches from Joerg Schilling could be included in your
ac patches without great difficulties?
In fact under your ac, I've got only one time a problem during burning a CD: that's not so much...
In the man page from cdrecord, there is:
 When using cdrecord with the  broken  Linux  SCSI  generic
       driver.   You  should note that cdrecord uses a hack, that
       tries to emulate the  functionality  of  the  scg  driver.
       Unfortunately,  the  sg driver on Linux has several severe
       bugs:
       o      It cannot see if a SCSI command could not  be  sent
              at all.
       o      It  cannot  get the SCSI status byte.  Cdrecord for
              that reason cannot report failing SCSI commands  in
              some situations.
       o      It cannot get real DMA count of transfer.  Cdrecord
              cannot tell you if there is an DMA residual  count.
       o      It  cannot  get number of bytes valid in auto sense
              data.  Cdrecord cannot tell you if device transfers
              no sense data at all.
       o      It  fetches  to  few  data  in  auto  request sense
              (CCS/SCSI-2/SCSI-3 needs >= 18).
Thanks,
