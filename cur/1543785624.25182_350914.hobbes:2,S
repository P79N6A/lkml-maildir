Right. They just signal to underlying hardware driver when they are in
use (open), but the actual power management is left to the specific
bus/driver, not input core.

Classes combine devices which are logically the same, i.e. they
perform similar functions. Buses combine devices that are perform
different functions but have similar hardware interface. For example a
network cards - it is a class. You can have network card sit on a PCI,
USB, ISA buses but for the rest of the kernel they are accesses
through netdev abstraction. At least this is my understanding of our
device model ;)
