I'm talking about the removal of the superblock lock from the filesystems.
Note: I don't have problems with the removal of the superblock lock even if
done at this stage, I'm not the one who can choose those things, it's Linus's
responsability to take the final decision for the official tree, but don't ask
me to test patches that removes the superblock lock _at_this_stage_ before I
can run a stable and fast 2.4.x because I won't do that. Period.

FYI: My current tree (based on 2.4.0-test8-pre5) delivers 16mbyte/sec in the
tiobench write test compared to clean 2.4.0-test8-pre5 that delivers 8mbyte/sec
instead with only blkdev layer changes in between the two kernels (and no
that's not a matter of the elevator since there are no seeks in the test
and I've not changed the elevator sorting algorithm during the bench).
Also I I found the reason of your hang, it's the TASK_EXCLUSIVE in
wait_for_request. The high part of the queue is reserved for reads.
Now if a read completes and it wakeups a write you'll hang.
If you think I should delay those fixes to do something else I don't agree
sorry.

I had an alternative VM, that I prefer from a design standpoint, I'll improve
it and I'll maintain it.
