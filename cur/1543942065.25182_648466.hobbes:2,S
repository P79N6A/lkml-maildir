so x86_64 will work well?
the problem is that BIOS does not assign one resource for you tg3. and
kernel pcibios_assign_to_unassign (?) try
to assign resource to your card.
revert the patch happen to work, you only have 2g less RAM (?), so
0x8000000 still can be used.
sometime you could get hang if your MB have two HT chains. ...because
BIOS already allocate two io range for the two chain.
and kernel may assign resource from the range1 belong to HT1 to device
under HT0.
solution: need pci root bios to provide _CRS to replace...
and i have one patch but it only take care of 64 bit kernel for this case.
easy solution for you: try to get one updated BIOS.
