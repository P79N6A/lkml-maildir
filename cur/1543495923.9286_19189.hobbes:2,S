If you're a capable OS person, you should start in
mm/vmscan.c and mm/filemap.c (shrink_mmap()).

I'm pretty sure that this documentation is nonexistant.
Unfortunately I'm too busy to write it and add it to the
Linux-MM home page :(
If you've written the docs (might come in handy for an

on the site and make sure the next person _is_ able to
find it?
