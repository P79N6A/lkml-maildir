There is a script in bugzilla that can be set up with procmail to accept
messages for appending comments.  Though there are some issues with it
that prevent even the mozilla site from enabling it in their own
bugzilla.  These are noted in
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44393
 as relating to
authentication and dealing with vacation/auto-responders. 
Perhaps this is an opportunity for someone that wants to work on a bug
tracker to enhance this script and contribute it to bugzilla.
