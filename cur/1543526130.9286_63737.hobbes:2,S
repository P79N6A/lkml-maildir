Hi!
When I try to play the DVD-Video "MADONNA - The Girlie Show - Live Down
under" (Warner, No 7599-38391-2) with XMOVIE
(
http://heroine.linuxbox.com/xmovie.html
) and a Toshiba DVD-RAM SD-W
1101 
the XMOVIE-player crashes immediately.
dmesg then shows me errors like this.
CD-ROM I/O error: dev 0b:01, sector 9171972
sr1: CD-ROM error: [valid=0] Info fld=0x0, Current sr0b:01: sense key

Then I tried this.

So why can't I read from this DVD? Other DVDs can be played without any
problems. On this DVD I can only play the file video_ts.vob which shows
me a copyright warning and a warner logo. The other files are completely
unreadable.
Is this DVD defective or does someone else know about problems reading
this DVD?
This DVD has got 2 data sides without printed label. The other DVDs
which I own and I can play without problems have 1 data side with a
printed label on the top.
Does this DVD have a special format which is not supported by the
linux-kernel or the drive?

Greetings, Michael
PS: I play DVDs with XMOVIE fluently in good quality on a Dual Pentium
II, 400 Mhz. This program is really great, and it is available under
GPL. See and download it at
