Subject: [rfc][patch] increase irq 12 penalty
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is something that Red Hat ships in its kernel.  I was thinking it
belonged upstream, but was told "Alan rejected it; reason forgotten" :)
Here is the logic for the patch:
> It makes the "pick any IRQ" code in the kernel not pick irq12 by default.
> irq12 is the ps/2 irq that gets emulated by smm on laptops.
> Using that can be sudden death on several machines.
> So the patch makes the cost of using it higher than the other irq's.
Arjan, one of our RH kernel rpm maintainers, also adds:
> for all I know it's totally wrong
> but it fixed some machines and it doesn't seem to break any
So I thought I would send it to lkml for comments.  RH has been carrying
this for a while...
