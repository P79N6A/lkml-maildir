Hi,
I'm experimenting problems with the rocket driver with a Comtrol 
Rocketprot ISA board, under Fedora Core 3 with a 2.6.10 kernel.
(Linux dala 2.6.10-1.766_FC3 #1 Wed Feb 9 23:06:42 EST 2005 i686 i686 
i386 GNU/Linux)
I have a multi-threaded application that opens 2 ports on the rocketport 
card, and happily talks to both devices connected to these ports.
But when I quit the application, the close on the last port leaves the 
thread that called close() and the rocket kernel module in a strange 
state: the thread changes between 'D' state with a wait channel of 
'release_dev' and running. It can't be killed. Lsof doesn't show the 
device as open anymore. Any try to open the device again fails with 
errno == EIO.
lsmod shows the kernel module used by 1 client, and I can't rmmod it.
Only a reboot can free the device and let me work further.
When I only use one device on the rocketport per process, everything is 
ok (or seems ok).
Any idea(s) on how to debug/fix that ?
