Seems more of an application issue than a kernel issue.
Does it work from the command line (could be a k3b bug after all)?
cdrecord with dvd support (unless prodvd version) is not worth using on
most drives.  growisofs is great for most drives.
The cdwrite mailinst list at lists.debian.org (not debian specific) is
the best place I know to get answers to cd/dvd writing questions.
