Have you seen Janet_Reno? 
ftp://linux01.gwdg.de/pub/cLIeNUX/interim/Janet_Reno.tgz
 IIRC.
Janet is an x86 bootsector that gets into protected mode and can
use the AT BIOS in pmode interrupts. It's written with a bunch of
m4 macros I call asmacs that I'm currently basing an assembler in 
Bash on. That's shasm in the same directory as Janet.
