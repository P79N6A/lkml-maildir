address and control bytes are really part of the medium-specific<BR>&gt; 
encapsulation.&nbsp; The data will be in a skbuff with enough headroom 
that<BR>&gt; the channel code can easily add them if it needs 
them.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Of course, 2 bytes is nothing, really, and if it makes 
life easier for<BR>&gt; most types of channel I don't mind putting them 
in.&nbsp; I thought they<BR>&gt; were really only used for async serial channels 
though (and then<BR>&gt; usually compressed out anyway).&nbsp; On balance I 
thought it was cleaner<BR>&gt; and neater not to have to worry about those 2 
bytes in the generic ppp<BR>&gt; code.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; 
Paul.<BR><BR>Paul:<BR><BR>The generic ppp code controls the LCP, but the LCP is 
used to negotiate<BR>media specific options, such as AFCF compression, or 
numbered transfer<BR>mode (RFC1663).<BR><BR>If the generic ppp code deals with 
data starting at the ppp protocol ID<BR>field,<BR>how do you envision 
communicating the results of the LCP negotiation<BR>to the channel which would 
implement the option.<BR><BR>Or for that matter, how does the channel 
communicate<BR>which options it supports. For example, PPP over X.25 (RFC1598) 
does<BR>not permit the AFCF compression option.<BR><BR>If we wish to define a 
generic sync adapter interface which just exchanges<BR>raw frames, does this 
imply a channel layer between such an interface<BR>and the generic ppp? For 
example: one channel for synchronous unnumbered,<BR>one for sync numbered, and 
another for X.25. All of these channels have<BR>the generic sync board interface 
on the bottom and a generic ppp interface<BR>on top?<BR><BR>Just 
curious,<BR>Paul<BR><BR>Paul Fulghum <A
