Hi,
I've got an own kernel thread which do something at every seconds :
int mythread ( void * unused )
{
  struct task_struct *tsk = current;
  /* stuffs, some task information cosmetic */
  for (;;} {
    /* usefull stuff here */
    tsk->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
    schedule_timeout(HZ);
  }
}
And I create the thread with :
kernel_thread(mythread, NULL, CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGHAND);
(I borrow the thread skeleton by learning from code of kswapd thread :)
But I've got some question :
* How can I sleep the thread to wake up only by an external effect (like calling
  a function from the other point of kernel, outside the thread)
* How can I destroy the thread by a function inside the thread
* How can I destroy the thread by a function outside the thread
I hope questions were clear enough despite of my poor English.
Thx : LGB,
