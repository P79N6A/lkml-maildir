Hi. the patch is fairly large, so I've provided a link to it. I'd 
appreciate it if someone could apply the changes in the following:
(the patch is relative to 2.6.10-rc3-bk10)
http://mnementh.co.uk/arm26linux/patches/arm26_2_6_10_archinc_patch.bz2
The changes are all local to arm26 - that is to say include/asm-arm26/ 
and arch/arm26/.
Mostly keep-it-compiling fixes, header updates, and a lot more FIXMEs 
added to highlight problem areas. Some significant code tidyups are 
beginning, and some more arm32 left-overs are removed.
