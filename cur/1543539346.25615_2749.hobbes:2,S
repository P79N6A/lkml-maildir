Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but if someone can trick the kernel into
thinking you're root, you can do a lot of things worse than trashing a
single partition... like, installing a backdoor, gaining console access,
etc. An attack that requires root access is not serious. One that can attack
without root access is. If you've lost root security, you're fubar in every
way already so worrying about what someone can do while root is pointless.
