I've been trying to run a long selftest on that drive, but the constant 
reboots are fscking that up.  I have attached the last smartctl -a output, 
indicating that the test was aborted probably from all the resets that are 
being issued, the last one froze me for around 5 minutes but I haven't 
rebooted yet.  Its attached.  Can anyone see if there is actually anything 
wrong with the drive?  If a boot will last long enough for the -t long to 
complete, then it passes with no errors, but this was interrupted now for the 
3rd time.
