I think that as a first step mutual coexistence is already quite
useful. 
Once I containerize applications, having the ability to actually
constrain and manage the resources consumed by that application would
be a real plus. In that sense a container and CKRM class coincide.
So even enforcing that "alignment" at a higher level through some 
awareness in the classification engine for instance would be quite
useful. Are they the same kernel object .. NO .. because of the 
life cycle management of a process, namely once moved into a container
it stays there...
