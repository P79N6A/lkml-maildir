Greetings everybody;
I ran across a notice tonight that K-Linux is changing its name to KaeilOS.
Nothing wrong with that except they've gone commercial and its no longer 
freely downloadable.  The only apparent method of getting it, even though 
its prominently displayed as being released under the GPL V2 license, is 
to buy the dvd for 299 euros.
Now I'd be the first to say that I'd expect it to come with very good 
initial support for that amount of money, because thats what you would be 
buying.  However, the lack of a freely downloadable version with no 
support certainly seems to be a GPL violation to me.  It should be checked 
out IMO.

Cheers, Gene
