I'm trying to get the EIP value from a simple program in C but i don't 
how to do it. I need it to know the current address position on the code 
segment.
main() {
   long *eip;
   asm("mov %%eip,%0" : "=g"(eip));
   printf("%p\n", eip);
}
Unfortunately EIP is not that kind of register :P
Does anyone know how to get EIP?
