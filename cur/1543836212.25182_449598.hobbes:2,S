The network request above needs to send what the new nlink will be set to.
This is so that the other nodes which have an interest in the inode can
determine whether the will need to do orphan processing on their last iput.
Really what they do is just compare against zero and mark the inode with a
flag indicating that it may have been orphaned. So we could just pass the
result of inode_is_unlinkable(), but I'd rather preserve the behavior that
we have today.
The ugly method is:
-  	status = ocfs2_request_unlink_vote(inode, dentry,
-  					   (unsigned int) inode->i_nlink);
+   	status = ocfs2_request_unlink_vote(inode, dentry,
+  		S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode) && inode->i_nlink == 2 ? 0 : inode->i_nlink - 1);
Better yet, we could store the result of the evaluation in a temporary
variable and pass that through to the request function.
Thanks,
