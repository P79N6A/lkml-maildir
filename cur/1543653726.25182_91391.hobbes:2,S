A few weeks ago I was surprised to find that code compiled with
-fomit-frame-pointers reliably executed a few percentages slower.
Since the functions I was testing were not anywhere big enough to
fill even the I1 cache, I wrote it off as 'the CPU is obviously
optimized to expect certain instruction sequences after call and
before ret'. Something to think about anyways...
