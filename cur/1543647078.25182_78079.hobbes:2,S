That would be nice, if it worked that way.  As it is we have
driver allocates foo
driver grabs a reference to foo->dev
....
somebody else grabs/drops temporary references to foo->dev
....
driver call put_device(&foo->dev)
driver frees structures refered from foo.
driver frees foo.
_IF_ the last two steps were done by ->release(), your arguments would
work.  Actually they are done by driver right after the put_device() call.
If you are willing to change that (== move all destruction into ->release()) -
yeah, then embedded struct device will work.  It's a hell of a work though.
