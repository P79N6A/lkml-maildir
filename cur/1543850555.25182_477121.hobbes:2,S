When CPUs are in different P-States, any resync effort will become
unsynced immediately.  I agree with that.  This is a further complication
that I think our code does not handle perfectly, yet.

If you know where the HPET base-address-register is, can't we program it
ourselves?  Even without HPET, we have PM Timer.  As long as you don't
need to resync the TSCs on most gtod(), you can still do better than not
trying.

Offset from what?  With automatic clock ramping in C1, the rate is
cycling up and down a lot.

Yeah, C1 is workaround-able, because the clock returns to full frequency,
and we never execute code in the reduced clock state.  Powernow makes it
more fun.  Not only do you need some offset, but you need some scalar.
Assume you resync TSCs to a clock (PM, HPET, whatever) any time any CPU
changes p-state.  Then you can calculate the approximate TSC for now by:
tsc_now = tsc_at_last_resync + ((rdtsc - tsc_at_last_resync) * pstate_scalar)
Something like that.  Not pretty, but still possible to get close.  And
close might be good enough.  As long as you can guarantee monotonicity and
approximate linearity, you can make most apps happy ENOUGH.
