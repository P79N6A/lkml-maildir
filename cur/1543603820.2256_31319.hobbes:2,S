Hi there,
A couple of days ago there was a discussion about a problem introduced
in 2.4.10 that would prevent APM on a Dell Latitude C600 (and possibly
others) from entering suspend mode.
A closer investigation revealed that the patch meant to correct a
problem with the internal ps2 pointing device on suspend is at fault.
Commenting out the entry in arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c that triggers
the activation of this logic for the C600 allows the machine to
suspend normally.
Does anybody know the purpose of this change?  It seems to address a
problem I've never seen on my computer...
