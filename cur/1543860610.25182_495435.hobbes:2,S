Except that every OFW implementation I have here shows you different
things for the same original binary data :-)

I would agree with you if the data was properly typed in the first place
but it's not, thus you end up with heuristics and I hate heuristics in
the kernel :-) Now, that's also why everybody on ppc has "lsprop" at
hand which does the "pretty printing" thing.
I like being able to have a simple way (ie. tar /proc/device-tree) to
tell user to send me their DT and have in the end an exact binary
representation so I can actually dig for problems, like a wrong phandle
in an interrupt-map or stuff like that...
Cheers,
Ben.
