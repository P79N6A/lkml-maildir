It should be getting done correctly at bprm_apply_creds.
The code you quote here is just setting it on the
binprm, which represents the executable itself (and as
pointed out in the comment above it).
Now the cap_bprm_secureexec() function needs to be
updated as I believe I pointed out in the original
submission.  But if anything else is not getting done
right please correct me.

Excellent, thanks.
