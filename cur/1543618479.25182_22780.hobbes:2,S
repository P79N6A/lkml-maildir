I think we have an explanation here.
With dbench 192 on -aa the first processes exit around
halfway through the dbench test and around the end only
few processes are left.
With rmap the write trottling is a bit smoother, but
this results in all processes running to about 70% through
the test and many more processes running at the last part
of the test, exiting simultaneously.
Considering the possible bad consequences for real
workloads, I'm not sure I want to make the system more
unfair just to better accomodate dbench ;)
regards,
Rik
