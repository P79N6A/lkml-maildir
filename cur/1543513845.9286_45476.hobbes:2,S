Hello Ted,
I'm reading the EXAR datacomm data book 1997 for the
ST16C554, this is a quad 1650A type device.
For programming the FCR register there is stated:
FCR bit 0: logic 0 disable xmit and recv fifo
FCR bit 0: logic 1 enable xmit and recv fifo;
THIS BIT MUST BE A LOGIC '1' WHEN OTHER FCR BITS ARE WRITTEN or
they will NOT BE PROGRAMMED.
I found a few spots where the fcr bits were written but without
bit 0 SET in the resulting pattern.
Is that right?
Kees
