I have another update to the rcfs patches more or less ready to go. I
hope to post them out this week.
Note that from user or controller perspective, there should be very
little difference between the two patches. rcfs is, I would say, same as
container patches to the extent of 70-80%. The rest of the difference is
mainly avoiding a new pointer in task_struct and new structures to
represent a task_group.
