No no no no no no no.
This "device" should be identified by either the class code OR the
subsystem device/vendor IDs.
By using "PCI_VENDOR_ID_DEC" and "PCI_DEVICE_ID_DEC_21285" you are referring
to a chip which can be:
1. A host bridge
2. A non-I2O add in card performing non-I2O functions
3. An I2O card
