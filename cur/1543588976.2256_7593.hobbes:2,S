No, I was thinking of one of the earlier 2.4 kernels.  2.4.3 seems

Mind doesn't do suspend-to-disk either.  I think it can with Windows but
I've never run Windows on it to find out :-)
I've always presumed the disk activity that starts after closing the lid
and before powering down is due to the kernel, or maybe apmd, calling
sync().

Hmm.  Perhaps apmd needs a "do not sync" option, for when you don't care.
