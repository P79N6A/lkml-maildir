I'm having the same problem on an old Cyrix PR200+.  It works fine with the
2.2 kernel that comes with Slackware 8, but _nothing_ else.  I've tried the
2.4 that comes with Slackware, compiling my own 2.2, 2.4 but it always
hangs.  I've tried with both 386 and Cyrix 686 kernels, but no dice.  
I used _exactly_ the same procedure that I use to upgrade my two firewalls
and desktop system, so I know my process is correct.
The only quirk to my setup is that I've got /boot mounted on an old 120MB
drive as I can't boot off the 40GB because of the old BIOS.
One last thing, one of the kernels, doesn't just hang, it reboots the whole
system.  I can't remember which kernel did this.
