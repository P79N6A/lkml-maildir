LSM only allows one principal security module at a time, but it allows to
switch between security modules. I am wondering what will happen if a user
switches between multiple security modules that label files. The new
module will see labels from the old module. It's a question of policy how
to deal with that case. Probably the policy restrictions the old module
was implementing should be considered invalid after another module was
used, and so the old labels should be ignored/removed.
Another case is stacked modules where more than one module needs file
labels. Your proposed API does not support that. I would rather use
individual attribute names for each module (e.g., "security.selinux",
etc.).
The design of filesystem EAs differentiates rough access policies by
attribute namespace ("system.*", "user.*", "trusted.*"). The system
namespace is special in that each "system.*" attribute may have different
access restrictions. Attributes in the "user.*" namespace are subject to
the same restrictions as the contents of the file the attributes are
attached to. Attributes in the "trusted.*" namespace are accessible only
to users capable of CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
The "security" namespace/attribute you are proposing is quite similar to
the "trusted.*" namespace, except that CAP_SYS_ADMIN does not grant any
rights there. It is unlikely that security modules will/can remove the
powers of the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability; many areas in the kernel depend on
it. I would expect that these modules make sure that no process will be
able to attain that capability in the first place. In that light, wouldn't
it be possible to use the "trusted.*" namespace for storing LSM file
labels instead (e.g., "trusted.selinux")? There's nothing wrong with
introducing another namespace if necessary, but we might be able to avoid
that.
Cheers,
Andreas.
