They shouldn't be.  PnP detection should occur before the system assumes the
location of a device.  I realize that it can be difficult given the current
state of many drivers.  Still, I think assuming information about a device,
especially if you consider how easy it is to get from ACPI etc., can be
potentially dangerous.

I agree.  Disabling the device is fine, but we _really_ should disable the
device with the BIOS before assuming a resource is free.
