careful with this; the quicklists aren't JUST for speed
they are also there to make sure a page we free that is a pagetable,
is not reused until we have finished flushing the tlbs on all the cpus that saw it.
This is a really hard correctness requirement, and while I can see
that quicklists are probably not the best way to achieve this, we can't just
throw away the behavior ;(
