Me no likee.
The fact is, we add system calls maybe a few times a year. Having to 
update two places instead of just one is not very onerous.
More importantly, the system call numbers should be something you have to 
think about, and a setup that makes it easy to merge new system calls with 
different numbers "by mistake" is a _bad_ setup.
Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying that "system calls should be hard to 
add, because only real men should add system calls". But I _am_ saying 
that it should be damn hard to add a system call by mistake at the wrong 
number, which is something your patch makes a lot easier than the current 
situation.
And I do believe that adding system calls should inherently be something
that you have to think twice about, even if one of the thoughs is just
literally writing out the number that you decided on. So while I don't 
think it should be "hard", it should definitely not be made any easier 
than it already is.
