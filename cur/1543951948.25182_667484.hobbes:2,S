A bit unfortunate really, given that use of ctags and friends in some editors
jumps to the first definition they come across, so if the prototype is stuffed
somewhere in include/, it shows the definitions from drivers or fs or wherever
that doesn't have the tag.
Given it doesn't cost us anything except a few more bytes in the source code,
is consistency such a bad thing?
