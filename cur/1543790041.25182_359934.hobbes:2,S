In theory, yes.  I certainly have access to large NUMA machines.
However, it is likely not a priority for me.  My focus is on work that
will benefit workloads that do not depend on pdflush (except to want to
be sure that pdflush is -not- running in a cpuset containing a dedicated
job.)
That seems to keep me busy enough (and keep my employer paying me),
so I might never get to this problem.  I might, but the odds are
not good.
Sorry.
