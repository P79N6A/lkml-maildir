Subject: [PATCH 10/19] dlm: recover locks waiting for overlap replies
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/24/199

When recovery looks at locks waiting for replies, it fails to consider
locks that have already received a reply for their first remote operation,
but not received a reply for secondary, overlapping unlock/cancel.  The
appropriate stub reply needs to be called for these waiters.
Appears when we start doing recovery in the presence of a many overlapping
unlock/cancel ops.
