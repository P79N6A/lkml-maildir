Okay, a laptop with a cold cache:
$ time git log v2.6.16..v2.6.17 > /dev/null
real    0m2.815s
user    0m1.264s
sys     0m0.044s
And, just for fun, having warmed the cache with that:
$ time git log v2.6.12..v2.6.17 > /dev/null
real    0m2.343s
user    0m1.656s
sys     0m0.068s
All 368519 lines (14 MB) of it.  I have to hand it to Linus,
when you say "git", it gits.
(On a not very related point having to do with git and the kernel,
I usually edit the root Makefile to set INSTALL_PATH to where I want
"make bzlilo" to put it, but this results in my kernels being named
v.2.6.17-dirty.  I can set INSTALL_PATH by hand on the command line,
except when I forget and waste a reboot.  I can't install a symlink,
because the install provess renames the symlink.  Is there an easy way
to semi-permanently change INSTALL_PATH without triggering the -dirty
detection?  Create a GNUmakefile that includes the Makefile?)
