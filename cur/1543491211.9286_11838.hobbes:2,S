Indeed. And it is the reason we talk about Linux at this list and not 
about GNU/Linux.

The Linux Operating System does not exist or just has more than a single
incarnation. The first linux based O/S I tried was Linux/GNU/X from
Yggdrasil. This one fitted your recommendations, but may-be it has just
been some chance.

The most popular Linux based O/S is "RedHat Linux" nowadays, that, btw,
seem not to contain a RedHat version of the Linux kernel, but may let
think, as you pointed out, that Linux is a RedHat program.

Agreed.
But, your post is just an 'off topic' with regards to the goal of the
linux-kernel development mailing-list which is to only deal with linux
kernel development and nothing else. 
If people and companies that make O/Ses out of Linux, GNU tools, X package
and some other major free softwares have decided to ignore name of some
major components of their O/S, it should well be due to some strong
reasons. Probably, they must choose a good name, short enough, for their
product for marketing issues and it seems that they decided that "Linux" 
was better than either "GNU", "X", or both "GNU" and "X".
