I can't comment on the internals about run_queues, overhead and so on, but 
these discussion leads me to the idea about a dynamic *tree* of scheduler 
queues.
With dynamic I mean that they are configured in user-space - be it with 
something like CLONE_NEW_SCHEDULER_CLASS, or possibly better some other 
interface to allow an *arbitrary* tree that is not coupled on the 
user/process/thread borders. New threads and processes are per default 
created in the parents queue, just like now.
So user-space could build an tree like this (eg with a pam module):
 Default queue - init
   +- kernel-thread queue (to avoid having kernel threads being blocked by
   |               user-space)
   +- cron, atd, sshd, .... unless they change their "class"
   +- user1
   |  +- X
   |  +- kde
   |  |  + konsole
   |  |  \ kmail
   |  |    + mail fetch thread
   |  |    + mail filter thread
   |  |    + GUI thread
   |  |  \- mplayer 
   \- user2
      +.....
Whether the queues are handled with some staircase behaviour, or CFS, or just 
get CPU time distributed by nice level, is another question - but they have 
to be "fair" only locally.
Of course, that's simply some sort of moving the problem into user-space - but 
I think (and read that often enough) that the needs vary so much that a 
single, hardcoded system won't suffice. And we can try to get the "right" 
behaviour in each queue, just like now.
Walking the tree might make the scheduler not fully O(1) - but per default 
only one queue is defined (or possibly two queues, one for kernel threads), 
and everything else can be done by user-space.
The mentioned case of a web-server with gzip started would be done with having 
each httpd being in a queue just below init, and having everything else in 
another - or by nicing the webserver, as it's defined as "important".
(I believe that's called "moving policy into userspace" :-)
