I think this really is gone. 0.03 was such an improvement on 0.02 that I 
think what happened was that I literally removed 0.02 (hey, it wasn't 
historically interesting at the time!). It's not the first time people 
have wondered about it.
0.03 was the first version where you could actually do things under Linux, 
and I think I could compile etc. I *think* it was released pretty close 
after 0.02, which made 0.02 appear even more flawed and a brown-paper-bag 
release.

Hmm. That one would be interesting, since the reason for the 0.03->0.10 
jump was that I was getting so happy with how it was actually working for 
me (ie able to compile itself under itself). But I don't see it, and it's 
not on google in the comp.os.minix archives either, afaik.
>  - v0.96 sources
Hmm. Odd. Might be another case of "0.96a was released as a 
brown-paper-bag fix for 0.96, and the latter hidden in shame".
Stupid bugs only appear endearing in retrospect.
>  - v0.99.12 announcement
Well, the 0.99.12 announcement is found by google.

In general, google groups (search by date and author, and make the group 
be something like *linux*) is good, I found the above on the first try.

Many of those might not have merited announcements. At some point I was 
just making tar-balls a few days apart, to let people track it.

Heh, nice. Those early versions are all smaller than the patch set we 
generate in a day these days :)
