The shared libraries are going to cause you 'issues' since these are
all loaded by dynamic linker. All the kernel loads is ld.so, the
rest of them are mmap'ed from userland.
So if you want to take this approach, you would have to hack a special
ld.so that only allows your authorized libraries and only authorize
the kernel to load that dynamic linker. Otherwise you have to do
content validation for all mmap operations.
