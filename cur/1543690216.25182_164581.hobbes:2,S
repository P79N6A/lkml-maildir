I'd not worry about runtime states for now. [If user wants to sleep
one device, we probably can allow that, but I do not think it is
reasonable to do much more for 2.6.X]. That leaves us with:
APM suspend-to-ram
APM suspend-to-disk
ACPI standby (S1)
ACPI suspend-to-ram (S3)
ACPI suspend-to-disk (S4bios)
swsusp
Do we want to support ACPI S2? I don't think so. That list is not
*that* bad.

Yes, but you'll have to have central database saying "nvidia VGA needs
to be in D1 during S3". I don't think that's good idea. Better put it
into the driver... Hopefully not many drivers will need such hacks.
