The problem here is one should consider, how all these little changes will
help to solve the big problems. Do they allow to more easily fix the big
problems or have these changes to be dumped again?
Most of the suggestions I've seen so far fix problems, which either can be
either fixed automatically or which don't exists anymore, once we switch
to a new syntax/parser. That's the reason I ask to understand the whole
picture, so we can judge whether a change is really necessary or not.

I can't give you a mathematical proof, but I tried very hard to keep the
behaviour the same. Unless I made mistake the rules are almost exactly the
same. Most of the CML1 rules are usable, there are only very few cases
which need manual fixing. I can't guarantee that where won't be any
surprises, but they should be easily fixable in the new system. (Unless
ESR I don't insist that my rulebase is correct or perfect, so I'm open to
suggestion/changes. :) )

Most of these problems can actually be fixed without syntax changes.
Something that can't be sanely fixed this way are recursive dependencies,
which I think are not worth fixing with the old parsers, but which are
easily fixable with the new syntax.
If you want to fix logical errors in the rulebase, they will be more
easily fixable with the new tools. For the X interface I'm planning some
debug options, which e.g. allow you to see the complete dependencies of
every symbol.
bye, Roman
