What widespread use of HTTP/1.1?
I justtried the following excercise:
Request a nonexistant page with HTTP/1.1 syntax.
a. Directly from Apache: I get a nice chunked HTTP/1.1 answer.
b. Via Squid: I get a plain HTTP/1.0 answer.
As long as not even Squid talks 1.1, how can we expect browsers to do it?
WebMUX? In a thousand years perhaps.
