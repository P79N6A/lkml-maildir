Quite the opposite - at least in the kernel source.
The general rule is that a .h file shall include the
.h files which contain declarations used by said .h files.
But naked declarations as above is preferred over including
a full header file.
We see the full header dependency thing to blow off when
inline function are used - which is more and more the case.
In several cases we have converted inline functions to macros
just to simplify the nightmare of header dependencies we have.
Arnaldo have a nice script that generate a .ps file
showing all the dependencies.
