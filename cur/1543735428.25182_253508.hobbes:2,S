Looks pretty sane here.  Your email client did wordwrap the patch, so
please fix that up henceforth.

ow.  I've split this fix into a separate patch.  Please leave this hunk out
of future patches.

It would be more convenient if we had a compile-time constructor for this
structure.  So device drivers can do:
static struct net_boards my_net_boards = NET_BOARDS_INIT(my_net_boards);
or
static DEFINE_NET_BOARDS(my_net_boards);
We may not need to retain net_boards_init() if we have NET_BOARDS_INIT().

Even though nothing here can actually fail, it's probably best to make this
return an integer error code, in case we add something new in the future.
You can remove that initial check - if someone passes in a null pointer or
a negative max_boards then they'll work out that something went wrong soon
enough.
I'd suggest that max_boards be made unsigned throughout the whole patch.

propagate `error' back to the caller

-ENOSPC, maybe?

remove this check.
