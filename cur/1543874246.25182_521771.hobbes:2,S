I explained precisely what I meant by 'smarts' and why I put it in
'smarts' in quotes. And here you are repeat that same exact damn thing

Sure, why not?

And yet they're still both block devices. That our current block layer
doesn't handle one as well as the other is something we should fix
instead of inventing a whole new full-feature but incompatible block
layer on the side.
