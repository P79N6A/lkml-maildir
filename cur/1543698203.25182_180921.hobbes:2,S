I believe that this issue is a memorymanagement issue, because cifs and
smbfs
are ram based file systems. This could be a even more critical issue then we
are expecting.
This is really causing file damages in eventually more than just smbfs and
cifs
systems.

PS: I made a second Thread with "PROBLEM: Corrupt files with kernel
2.6.0_test11 and smb mounts" in the
subject, to meet the bug report requirements.
