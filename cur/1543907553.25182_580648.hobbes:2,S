There is certainly more cleanup that can be done.  
This was just an easy incremental step.
It's not going to get quite to "completely generic".  On other machines the
32/64 flavors are not quite as similar as on powerpc, so there is some more
code required there.  There will have to be a lot of per-arch macros and
functions, even if they are unified to compat_* names.
Thanks,
Roland
