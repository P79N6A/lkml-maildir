I can't see an option to just disable HT with a quick grep. acpi=off
should do it though.
The virtual processors should get a roughly even amount of work done
AFAIK. I don't think the P4 allows any sort of control over priorities.

Oh, so it is not any sort of disk IO work that is getting stuck? Then
don't worry about getting the Ctrl Scroll Lock trace...
OK, well yes turn HT off and see if that helps. One other thing which
springs to mind is that there is some CPU scheduler code that increases
timeslice grainularity as the CPU count increases. It seems a bit unlikely
that this is your problem though.
