Way 1:
mount -nt tmpfs none /var/lib/nfs;
mount -nt nfs fserve:/tftpboot/linux /mnt;
mount -n --move /var/lib/nfs /mnt/var/lib/nfs/;
./run_init -c /mnt /sbin/init; # or similar
And you can also start locking after pivot_rooting to /mnt, that would 
not even require (/mnt)/var/lib/nfs to be a separate mount.
Ok, did I miss it all?
