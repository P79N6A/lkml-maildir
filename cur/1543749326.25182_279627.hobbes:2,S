Subject: [PATCH] collect page_states only from online cpus
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/12/16/232

   I noticed the function __read_page_state() curiously high in a
q-tools profile of a write to a software raid0 device.  Seems this is
because we're checking page_states for all possible cpus and we have
NR_CPUS possible when CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y.  The default config for ia64
is now NR_CPUS=512, so on a little 8-way box, this is a significant
waste of time.  The patch below updates __read_page_state() and
__get_page_state() to only count page_state info for online cpus.  To
keep the stats consistent, the page_alloc notifier is updated to move
page_states off of the cpu going offline.  On my profile, this dropped
__read_page_state() back into the noise and boosted block write
performance by 5% (as measured by spew - 
http://spew.berlios.de
).
Thanks,
	Alex
