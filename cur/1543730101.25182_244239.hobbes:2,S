People will find this kind of language inflammatory. ;) However, exactly
because it is such a bad mistake did Linus put out what he deemed a
correct fix *immediately*.

The open question is whether write permission really is meaningful
enough to allow arbitrary SCSI commands. I personally think "being
able to wipe the drive firmware" is too much, and since filtering
of vendor commands is generally impossible to do right, sending SG_IO
should require CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability.

Currently (2.6.8.1), there is a list in the kernel. I agree that it
doesn't make sense. I would think read permission means to be able
to read from the device, write means you can write. I would even go
as far as *not* to have that mean "you can also read/write via SG_IO",
because for normal uses of the device, read(2) and write(2) should be
enough.
BTW, there are a number of people on the kernel list who believe a
filter list is bad and generally unmaintainable.

Good point.

I don't think that's going to happen. You already said you'd be okay
with euid==0 being required for burning, if only the transition
period were longer. So if people complain to you that cdrecord is
broken with 2.6.8, you will have to tell them burning requires root
for the moment. Then in your next release, change your startup
code not to drop the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability when you drop root
privileges.
Alternatively, provide a patch that changes the current code to just
require write permission or CAP_SYS_RAWIO to be able to send
arbitrary commands. Then, after a transition period, submit a patch
that changes it to just CAP_SYS_RAWIO. The patch would look like the
one below (untested).
Jens, since this seems to be your code, what do you think?
