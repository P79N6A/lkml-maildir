Er, yes.  (After my six red bulls at the Blackthorn party, I've gone cold 
turkey on caffeine for a bit to detox.  I'm surprised I'm still upright.)

I cc'd the arm list, which he's on.  Low enough traffic I expected him to get 
it soonish, but I can cc: him directly if you like.

Sorry, that's from my quick grab of the web page above.
I expect this to come through the proper arm channels rather than mine, the 
attach was just to be specific about the patch I was talking about.

That's what the patch looked like when I got it. :)
I'm just an intrested party who's been trying to fix this particular problem 
on my own (without success) for a couple months now.  I hadn't been able to 
upgrade Firmware Linux past 2.6.20 because ARM doesn't work on the newer 
stuff, and it still doesn't work on 2.6.22-rc7 without this fix.
I found the fix yesterday, and would really really like it not to miss the 
actual release.  This was my attempt to make puppy eyes at subsystem 
maintainers and add a signed-off-by to a small fix that unblocks a project 
I'm working on. :)
