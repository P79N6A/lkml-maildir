Really, the problem for both, union mounts and unionfs, is that the concept
of unioning spans the two layers. You have the unification part - which is
very VFS-level concept, but at the same time, you got whiteouts, copyup,
(semi-?)persistent inode numbers, and a bunch of other details that just
don't belong in the VFS at all.
