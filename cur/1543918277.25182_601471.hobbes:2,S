OK, so I don't exactly understand you either. To make it simple, can
you give a concrete example of a cpuset hierarchy that wouldn't
work?

OK, so to really do anything different (from a non-partitioned setup),
you would need to set sched_load_balance=0 for the root cpuset?
Suppose you do that to hard partition the machine, what happens to
newly created tasks like kernel threads or things that aren't in a
cpuset?
