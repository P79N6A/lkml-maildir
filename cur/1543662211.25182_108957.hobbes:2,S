Just for throwing out suggestions, UML can easily avoid using
glibc altogether as it is already intimate with the system call layer.
Or it can use the linker to play games with symbol names to move the kernel off
into it's own separate name space.
This sounds like a good opportunity to figure out which makes most sense 
and future proof UML.
