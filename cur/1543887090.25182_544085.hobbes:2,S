Hi Al,
	This patch has been superseded.  But to clarify, the address generally
comes from a guest register.  My confusion came from sparse warnings on
the above code like the following:
	warning: cast removes address space of expression
I inserted __force, but it's actually caused by the "addr" being a
"u32": if it's an "unsigned long" sparse doesn't warn.  This is a win
anyway: although the code is i386-specific at the moment, that will
change.  I prefer to use u32 rather than unsigned long to declare
registers (eg. if I ever wanted to support 32 bit guests on a 64 bit
host), but that's not even a consideration at this stage.

	Yes, but this is clearer.  Here's adjust_pge:
static void adjust_pge(void *on)
{
	if (on)
		write_cr4(read_cr4() | X86_CR4_PGE);
	else
		write_cr4(read_cr4() & ~X86_CR4_PGE);
}
And here's the two calls to it:
		on_each_cpu(adjust_pge, (void *)0, 0, 1);
...
		on_each_cpu(adjust_pge, (void *)1, 0, 1);

Yeah, gone in replacement patch.

Last I tried, this turns out to create even more casts.

Indeed, replacement patch uses unsigned long.
Thanks,
Rusty.
