It makes sense for Linux to default to normal cable lengths in absence
of some mechanism to detect or specify this; in this case my CF card
is plugged directly into the motherboard with a CF adapter [1], so one
device, short traces. Anyway, I'd imagine the "special handling" and
other requirements have been introduced/influenced by vendors, so
possibly more special-cased than possible here.

I couldn't find a kernel parameter to specify if I have a long/short
cable. Is there a way?

Thanks for the detail in the other mails too; it's useful,
