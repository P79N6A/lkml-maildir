Personally, I prefer my comments quiet and unobtrusive, and I think
you'll find Linus' code tends to be the same.
Not to start a flame war, but since I started using a colorizing
editor for code, I found there was no need to waste vertical space
with large banners.  (This in my mind justifies the X project's entire
existence).
Sorry,
Rusty.
