This was actually just an example circunstance of why somebody would
not report a bug. Dozens of other circunstances may be given, and it
just illustrates why would be good to have those bug reports without
user interaction. Of course I can go to bugzilla and fill a report
upon a bug, but I wouldn't care to have bug reports being sent from my
servers automatically, if it's an option. This would ensure that even
bug report from non-caring users are, well, reported.
