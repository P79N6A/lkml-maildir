At the expense of additional latency.  It really weirds you out when the volume,
tone, and mute buttons have a full second lag ;)

I have to admit on my laptop, I've failed to see much subjective improvement
since O7 or so, as  VM and IO issues have predominated since then. The
scheduler is basically powerless and the VM manager only slightly more so when
the *proper* fix is probably stick another 256M in. ;)
Either that, or put the XFree86 4.3.0 server on a severe diet - 'ps aux' is reporting
that as I type, mine has VSZ=384852 and RSS=64724.  Thrown in a mozilla
with VSZ=122900 and RSS=47316, and you're just waiting for things to
degrade into thrashing.
At least for my laptop, any future performance wins are going to come from
elsewhere than the CPU scheduler - I'll pick reiser4, VM manager, and I/O
manager as top contenders, with "being able to recompile the CPU hogs with xlc"
as a long-shot.. ;)

Amen to that.  I point xmms at a bunch of .ogg's, it plays them, and it does so
well enough that I've not gotten peeved enough to go find a replacement.
