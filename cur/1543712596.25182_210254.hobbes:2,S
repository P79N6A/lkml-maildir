it was me to reistantiate it. And it wasn't for mprotect. Infact it was
me adding it to mprotect and mremap too, it has never been there before
(the day I did mprotect and mremap I got bored at some point and that's
why we never had it for mlock yet).

You still can write an exploit for it, but it will not be a real life
