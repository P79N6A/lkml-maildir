I don't think its remotely related to the IDE layer
A number of VIA boards have hardware/bios problems that cause corruption
under certain very high PCI loads. Current 2.4 should set the registers
to do the work arounds needed on the various boards we know have the 
problems as do the VIA 4in1 drivers for windows in most afflicted cases.
The description sounds extremely like that is the problem with this board.
