It'd like to see the output of 'size vmlinux' with optimizations turned 
off. The kernel is full of forwarding functions and constructs that 
optimize away to nothing.
Last time I tried, the kernel wouldn't even compile at -O0, but that may 
have changed with the always_inline work.
And it is *not relying* on compiler optimizations that is stupid. It 
means you're throwing away the work of the compiler folk, and doing it 
instead *by hand* at every piece of code you write.

Ha ha.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
