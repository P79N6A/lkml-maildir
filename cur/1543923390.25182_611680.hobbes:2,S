So if I decide that the cpu is busy (because something is asking me to
write the cpu is clearly doing something and hence busy), then I can
skip compression and just write to disk.  So by that definition ext4
already does compression.  What a simple project. :)
Did you mean it ought to come back and do the compression later?
Is it possible that for some data compressing it and writing will take
less time than not compressing it and writing it to disk?
