That has been true for a long time.  The only difference is that the 
driver has been moved to drivers/net/tulip/dmfe.c and the configure option 
has been hidden under Network device support / "Tulip" family network 
device support".
Jeff, would you care to enlighten us as to why this was done?  To educate
users that the Davicom chip is really a (bad) tulip clone?
Are you planning to reorgonize the "Network device support" menu as a
whole?  It's a mess.
