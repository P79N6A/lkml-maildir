Hi,
my patch below was added to 2.6.23.15 and linus tree that became 2.6.25, but 
was too late for 2.6.24. So if you consider another stable release for 2.6.24 
you might want to add that patch too.
Kind regards,
Gerd
Fix overwriting the stack with the version string
(it is currently 10 bytes + zero) when unloading the
capidrv module. Safeguard against overwriting it
should the version string grow in the future.
Should fix Kernel Bug Tracker Bug 9696.
