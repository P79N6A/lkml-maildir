Well, my experience is that it works OK.  I have two machines that are running 
2.2.1 and diald 0.16.5.  I do get some errors in /var/log/messages that add 
route failed but it only seemed to have a minor side effect, I couldn't 
traceroute from any host on my internal network because the routes weren't quite
right, somehow this only affected traceroute, not ping, or other tcp or udp 
based services.
To fix this little problem I went to juanjox web site 
(
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Campus/4869/
) and downloaded his diald 
rpm.  I still get errors about route in the logs, but no longer have the 
traceroute problem.  You could probably also fix the route problem by setting 
diald to not use defaultroute but rather custom ip-up and ip-down scripts, then 
write scripts to manually add the correct routes, still I haven't needed to do 
this, I just igonre the errors since they have no ill effects.
Later,
