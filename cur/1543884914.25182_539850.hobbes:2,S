Hmm, okay.  Probably wants a comment in there explaining it, and we
should poke jejb to fix it for real :)

No, sorry.  I should have written a better explanation.  scsi_host_alloc
is designed to allocate space for your private data aswell.  So you
should call it early on an allocate the sbp2_device as part of the Scsi_Host
instead of just stuffing in a pointer.

Okay, so sbp2 decided to be non-standard here, what a pity.  It's probably
better to use scsi_scan_target with a specific lun, though as scsi_add_device
is a rather awkward API.

Needs documentation at least.  And at least my preference would be
to have a deleted flag instead of the null setting because the latter
can easily paper over bugs.
