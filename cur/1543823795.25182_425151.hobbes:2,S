How? The segment you quoted basically says "no need to put any "MEM" resources
into E820 because the OS will know about those from its PCI scan".
And for an OS to map pci devices like cardbus or hotplug PCI anywhere, it obviously
needs to know about PCI so this is entirely a fair assumption.
MCFG is new. It's not traditional and it generally isn't a MEM region on any
PCI device. The result is that OSes that do not know about MCFG (like Windows XP)
do not at all know that there is something there already in the address space.
Neither the wording of the spec pieces you quoted nor common sense can lead to
a "but it doesn't have to be marked reserved" interpretation... the OS just has
to know what address space is free for mapping things into, via one way or another.

yes this is the MEM BARs. Different animal.

there were several, some I can't talk about.
Let me ask you a counter question: could you provide more details on the opposite case, and did the
vendor release an updated, fixed BIOS ?
