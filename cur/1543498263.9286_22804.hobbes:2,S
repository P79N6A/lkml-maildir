OS: RH 5.2
dhcpcd: 1.3 (see below)
3com 3c509 connect to LanCity cable modem.
Problem: When initializing dhcpcd, I receive message
"can not locate net-pf-17". At this point I noticed
my eth0 interface dissappears from 'ifconfig -a'.
At the same time, my /var/log/messages file shows
right after the net-pf message the following;
Dhcp_start: Invalid Argument
I dont know if net-pf and Dhcp_start are related.
I am sure the invalid argument is the SOCK_PACKET
arg to socket(). 
I upgraded dhcpcd from the RH 5.2 packaged version
of 0.70 out of desperation. I had seen references
calling that version buggy. Prior to 1.3, I had
some other version (cant remember which) where
the author said to "make sure my kernel is compiled
to support SOCK_PACKET". I have tried unsuccessfully
to do that. Also, the 0.70 version of dhcpcd 
always gave me "NO DHCPOFFER" message. I was able
to tcpdump -i eth0 and see traffic going out
to my provider. I can not do that now with 1.3
(tcpdump always reports interface down) but it
seems I might be closer.
Can anyone help me with this? 
Thanks
Greg C.
