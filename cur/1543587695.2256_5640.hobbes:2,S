Hello everybody !
I'm begging your pardon for possibly stupid question,
but digging through headers/sources of kernel gives me next to nothing.
The question is:
can I use IPC (specifically, msgsnd/msgrcv) inside of loadable module ?
<linux/msg.h> defines 
sys_msgsnd and sys_msgrcv, but insmod'ing my module
says this symbols are undefined, ksyms -a | grep sys
confirms total internality of this functions (in other words, this symbols 
aren't exported :)
Can usage of sys_call_table[__NR_sys_ipc] help me, or this is totally wrong 
approach ? 
These mechanisms (IPC message queues) are fitting really nicely into my task, 
and I don't want to reimplement the wheel.
Please, tell me, where to look.
With all the best, yarick at relex dot ru
