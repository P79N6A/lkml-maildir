reiserfs is blindly storing the kernel's kdev_t value raw to disk.
AFAICS this will need a policy decision not just cleanup, before it
works in 2.5.2 properly.  If we switch the kernel to 12:20 major:minor
numbers, suddenly the reiserfs disk format changes based on kernel
version, and earlier kernels see corrupted major:minor numbers.
For many filesystems with just 16-bits of major/minor storage, they
store the raw kdev_t value as well, but have different problems when
12:20 comes around.
If reiserfs guys had planned ahead they would be decoding the
major/minor number before it hits disk, and already storing it in 12:20
fashion or somesuch.
Unless I am missing something...
