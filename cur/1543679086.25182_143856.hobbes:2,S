Subject: [BK PATCH] USB update for 2.4.22-pre2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here are some USB bugfixes and updates against 2.4.21.  There biggest
thing here is a speedtouch driver cleanup to use the kernel's crc32
code, and a ftdi_sio update.  I've also included the one-shot interrupt
patches that are shipping in the latest Red Hat kernel, and have had
many people wanting for a while now.
I've also removed the floating point code that was present in the last
USB patches that went into 2.4.22-pre1.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/marcelo-2.4
The individual patches will be sent in follow up messages to this email
to you and the linux-usb-devel mailing list.
thanks,
greg k-h
