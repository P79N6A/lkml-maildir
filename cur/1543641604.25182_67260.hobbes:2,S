I doubt that's the problem. As I've said before, I don't have this huge
slowdown problem if I plug the writer to a Promise pdc20265 or CMD649,
neither of which supports DMA for ATAPI devices. These controllers
however abort CD writing randomly so they are not a workaround... I
also don't have your DAO vs. TAO problem.

Yes it does.

I've tried disabling interrupt sharing for IDE that but it didn't
change anything.  hdparm -c3 I haven't tried yet, I'll have to see if
it would help.
