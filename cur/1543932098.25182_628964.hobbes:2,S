Yes, and when the user/distributor specifically selected udelay or none as 
an I/O delay method it makes no sense whatsoever to have the kernel override 
that again -- the DMI hack only fixes something for the default case, when 
_no_ specific choice had been made (which the current setup can't express 
but mine did).
I feel particularly strongly (always) about that "listen to its master" bit. 
The kernel does not know better then whomever configured it, even when it does.
Rene.
