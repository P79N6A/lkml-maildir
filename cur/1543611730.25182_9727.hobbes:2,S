I think that you've only saved some symbols in the vmlinux file, symbols
that will get stripped off anyway when building the bzImage.  If you
want to see the real difference, remove the second "remove $$$tmppiggy"
from arch/i386/boot/compressed/Makefile and look at the _tmp_NNNNNpiggy
file left there.
