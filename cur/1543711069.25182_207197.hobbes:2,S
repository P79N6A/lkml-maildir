I have implemented a memory defragmentation utility
for linux kernel 2.6 based on the paper by Mr. Daniel
Phillips.
Can this utility be used instead of the bigphysarea
patch, for requirements less than MAX_ORDER of
allocation ?
Can the people using the bigphysarea patch kindly
provide me with their respective memory requirements.
Alok.
