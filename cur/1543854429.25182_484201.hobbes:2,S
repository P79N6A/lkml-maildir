As Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt explains, there is no stable 
kernel API. If you don't want to get the APIs your driver uses 
changed/removed you should really try to get it merged into mainline.
The find_bus() case is even more interesting since you are using it in a 
driver although it has never been exported to modules. Considering that 
you anyway have to patch the kernel for getting your driver running 
(since it won't run as a module against an unmodified kernel), you could 
simply undo my patch locally until you submit your driver for inclusion 
in mainline.
