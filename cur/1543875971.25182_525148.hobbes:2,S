Not just more code, but more security issues too.
Passing system call arguments by value means that there are no subtle 
security issues - the value you use is the value you got. But once you 
pass-by-reference, you have to make damn sure that you do the proper user 
space accesses and verify the pointer correctly.
User-space (aka "user-supplied") pointers are just more dangerous. We 
obviously can't avoid them, but they need much more care than just a 
random value directly passed in a register.
