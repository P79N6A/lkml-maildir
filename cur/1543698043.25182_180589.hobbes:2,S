Greets to linux-kernel people,
  I have noticed that it is not possible to configure the kernel to use the 
xfs file system using the 'make xconfig' command.
  'make menuconfig' and 'make gconfig' appear to work correctly.
 No need to reply, & I'm not worth to be be subscribed because of insufficient 
knowledge.
