Who talks about modifying anything ?

Well, perhaps I buy this, but as this looks like a strange/buggy thing, as

Do your homework.
free gives the free amount of memory _available for the user_, ie, the
full memory of the box minus the kernel reserved part.
From dmesg:

So free/proc give the available memory, not the total:
- free: 1010 Mb
- kcore: 1022 Mb
I expected /proc/kcore to give the size of your installed memory, with
the reserved BIOS areas just not accesible, but it looks like it already
has them discounted, so gives 1022 Mb.
It looks really silly to have a motd say "wellcome to this box, it has
2 xeons and 1022 Mb of RAM".
