Here's a half-successful attempt. With this patch, the device no longer
appears twice, and it always works on the first open (at least, so I've
observed up to this point). The open following a successful open usually
fails (roughly speaking, it appears to play dead), and the open following
a failed open usually (always?) succeeds.
So, on my PL-2303, it's not perfect but it's certainly livable.
This patch is based on the one I did for 2.4, and in fact, this code
functions when it's plugged into 2.4.20-pre10 instead of 2.5.42. In that
scenario, the opens work 100% of the time.
I'd be interested in suggestions or comments regarding this patch.
Anyone who has a PL-2303 working under 2.5 might want to try this patch
just to make sure it doesn't kill their working setup.
