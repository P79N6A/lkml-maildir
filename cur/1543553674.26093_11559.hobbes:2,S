OK, how then using _2_ modules, data and worker:
- Data (containing the mixer levels or whatever other data you want to save)
  can only be unloaded after resetting to some default state. When loading
  it sets the default state.
- Worker does the work, and on loading loads the data one (if not yet
  resident) [This is automatic as the worker depends on symbols the data
  module exports].
No funny "persistent data" mechanisms or screwups when the worker gets
removed and reinserted. In many cases the data module could be shared among
several others, in other cases it would have to be able lo load several
times or manage several incarnations of its payload.
Sure, makes sense only if the worker module is largeish; if not, just let
it stay put (When reconfiguring anything, increment module use count;
decrement on reset. This should do the trick also for the data module
above).
