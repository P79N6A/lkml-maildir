	Actually there is -- presuming your CPU has lots of registers,
	which i386 does not have...
	This rule -- "no -lgcc in kernel code" -- is to trap code which
	in fast-paths would call those slow routines.
	Fastpaths should either not grok such values, or at most use
	shifts.
	To think of it, there really should be explicitely callable
	versions of these with LinuxKernel names for them, not gcc
	builtins.   That way people would *know* they are doing
	something, which is potentially very slow.
	(And the API would not change from underneath them.)
