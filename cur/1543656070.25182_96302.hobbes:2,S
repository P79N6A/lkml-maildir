It would be a little overhead.  kmalloc is damn quick, and remember
that this data has to be copied from userspace and has go to disk
sometime.   These things will make the kmalloc overhead very small.

As little as possible?
One way of measuring these things is with your trusty linusometer.
Manfred and I were sent back to the drawing board last week for a
function which used 400 bytes...

uh-oh.   We need to be very sparing indeed.
I had a patch once which would print out "maximum stack space
ever used by this process" on exit, but Alan fumbled it.  I shall
resurrect it.
