I agree -- I also want to take a look at the padding and size of
other values passed to/from the kernel. I don't think we want to do
another ABI again anytime soon.

we can make libc5 work with in a 32-bit uid_t system, by being
careful. no amount of care will mkae most libc5 programs work with a
32-bit pid_t kernel after a period of time

I don't think this is really an issue

Right _now_ it is for most people, later on, there may be cases when
it is not. You need a big machine, 32K processes requires 256M of
non-swappable kernel memory. Ouch.
In reality, I don't know how well the scheduler will handle many
processes either.

You have to be a little more careful than this. DaveM a while back
mentioned one of the sparc platforms can fork 10,000 times a second
(I think). This means you can wrap this in under a week...

OK

I think 32-bits with a lesser amount of reuse is acceptable.
What would be nice is to see 64-bit platforms have a 64-bit pid_t,
even if initially it does wrap and 2^32.
