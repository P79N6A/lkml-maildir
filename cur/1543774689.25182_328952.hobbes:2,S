So looking over the code a little for the plugin debate I found that a
reason patch introduces a ->put_inode method in reiser4.  We plan to
kill ->put_inode because it's the wrong abstraction and almost impossible
to use non-racy (reiser4 usage is racy).
I had a discussion with someone from namesys how to solve this correctly,
but I don't remember the details of either the solution or problem anymore.
Unless someone else does let's describe the problem again so we can find
a proper fix.
