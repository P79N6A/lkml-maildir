  It's restricted to ELF binaries, which won't do distributions like
  Mastodon very much good, and won't work with Java/Perl/Python/designer
  scripting language of the week executables.
  As I think about it, the idea of a whole new kind of binary becomes
  more appealing, which is simply a little self-contained filesystem
  that can be loop-mounted when some application tries to access it.
  Most of the functionality for doing this already exists (modulo
  a volume manager for growing/shrinking the filesystem as the stuff
  inside it grows and contracts), so it might be doable with no more
  code than the hooks to binfmt_misc and whatever gross magic you'd
  need to have /usr/X11/bin/xdm start xdm, and /usr/X11/bin/xdm/.
  open the directory so you can muck around inside it.
