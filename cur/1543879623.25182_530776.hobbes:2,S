The problem was not in the transfer from PC -> Device, but from Device
-> PC. If I remember correctly, the 512 limit (in the
urb->transfer_flags) is used to setup the DMA. When the device sent
packets which were 1024 bytes in size, the urb came back with a status
set to -EOVERFLOW.
The only place this could happen (in the EHCI) is in qtd_copy_status()
where the hardware has reported a "can't proceed" error (via
QTD_STS_HALT) and then the QTD_STS_BABBLE bit is set (which I interpret
to mean that the device on the other end is "babbling").

In a sense they did when there was no way for me to do BULK transfers
without slamming me with 1024 byte packets :-).
