Then you must not have looked at the bestbits.at code at all.  It includes
a generic VFS interface for EAs and ACLs.  There are ext2, ext3, and XFS
codes which work with this VFS interface.
Some people have had complaints about the bestbits VFS interface, and
another one for people to look at is never a bad thing.
Cheers, Andreas
