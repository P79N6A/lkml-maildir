It's a inefficiency because you split up the 2MB (or 1GB) pages
in the direct mapping, although that is not strictly needed. This
means everybody who happens to use memory in same 2M/1G region
will eat unnecessary TLB misses.
It would be generally better to only execute your code in
ioremap_cache() because that won't affect anybody else.
Eventually set_memory_x() will work correctly for ioremap() too
so that should work then.
