Sorry, Alan. It WAS there. And was removed by LINUS's request. So...

Yes. The whole idea behind recent removal of compatibility entries out of
devfs is to clean up this horrible mess in /dev . It was Linus's idea and
I like it :-) So probably better way is to change "Linux Allocated Devices"
document to reflect devfs changes (AFAIK HPA promised to do this in the future
anyway).
P.S. Of course you can return old /dev/tty0 ... /dev/tty64 with devfsd if you
want.
