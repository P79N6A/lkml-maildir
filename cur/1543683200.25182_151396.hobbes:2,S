Hm, as long as we add a kobject to the module structure, so that users
of a module can be tracked somehow to know if it is safe to unload the
module or not.
This is because there is a difference between device reference counts,
and code reference counts, which is why I added the module owner logic
to sysfs attributes, to prevent code from being unloaded when the device
might already be gone.
So can the following situation still work with this proposed patch:
	- device created
	- sysfs files created associated with that device
	- user opens sysfs file
	- user disconnects sysfs files.
	- device goes away, driver no longer references device, but
	  kobject count is still incremented.
	- driver associated with device is unloaded.
	- user reads sysfs file previously opened (which calls into
	  module memory that is now gone.)
Can we still prevent this from happening now?  I think if we add a
kobject (or something, we still need a kobject to get module
parameters so might as well use that), we might be safe.
thanks,
