  It is perfectly possible that I messed something up, although I
double checked what I was doing on the MCP51.  However, on that board
(an Asus M2NPV-VM) I'm running the 2.6.22-based Ubuntu Gutsy default
kernel with a recompiled forcedeth, as opposed to a vanilla 2.6.24-rc6
on the CK804, where your patch worked.  It may be that the different
kernel is throwing the patch off somehow.
  Later on today I'm going to try the MCP51 with the same build of
2.6.24-rc6 (built on a .config from the Ubuntu Hardy development
kernel) I'm running on the CK804, and post results.
