This is a snippet of a little program I wrote called vtswitch that
shows how to use the VT_ACTIVATE ioctl.  This works as a normal user,
so you might be using it wrong.  I can send the whole program if you
want to see how the whole thing works but this is the guts:
<--- begin code block ---->
int vtfd;
#define VT_DEVICE_FILE "/dev/tty"
vtfd = open(VT_DEVICE_FILE, O_RDWR, 0);
  if(vtfd < 0)
    {
      printf("*error* Could not open /dev/tty\n");
    }
  /* Save the current vt index to the history file */
  save_cur_vt_index(vtfd);
  /* Switch to the terminal if there wasn't an error looking up the
  alias */
  if(ioctl(vtfd, VT_ACTIVATE, terminal))
    {
      printf("*error* Error switching to terminal %s (%d)\n", vt,
  terminal);
      return -1;
    }
<-- end code block -->

You can save the framebuffer contents to a program array and then poll
the current vt every once and a while (using VT_GETSTATE and
vt_stat.vt_active), check to see if your program is on the visible vt
and then copy it back to restore it.  This could also keep your
program from drawing to the framebuffer when it's not visible.

Create an offscreen surface using malloc and do your rendering to that
and then do a memcpy (simple way) or hardware accellerated blt (faster
but harder to setup).
