could you remove the avg_slice heuristics from reschedule_idle()? [the "if
(p->policy == SCHED_OTHER)" part of reschedule_idle().] You are using
SCHED_OTHER threads, right? I do have some fixes and improvements in that
area, but it's not yet ready for public consumption.
basically it might happen that the heuristics say that a given process
will reschedule 'soon', but this never actually happens. If you are using
RT threads then this should never happen though.
