Easy, it happens all the time, there are just no tests in place to see it.
We are keeping a histogram of how long every IDE DMA transfer takes 
place.  In ide_intr we record the time and set the start time in 
ide_drive_t to 0.  In ide_dma_proc, ide_dma_begin right AFTER activating 
the dma, we store the current value of jiffies in start time in ide_drive_t.
In both those places we check to make sure that the value of start_time 
is sensible.  In ide_dma_begin, we make sure it's 0 and in ide_dma_intr, 
we make sure its non-zero.  Because of this race condition, we often saw 
DMAs finish before they began.
In the normal kernel, the only thing I can see that could go wrong would 
be that the printk
printk("%s: ide_intr: huh? expected NULL handler on exit\n", drive->name);
in ide_intr  could be triggered.  I've never seen it happen, but I 
believe with enough effort, it could be made to occur.
