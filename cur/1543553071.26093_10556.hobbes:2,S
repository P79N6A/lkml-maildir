In fs/proc/array.c:proc_pid_statm() there is this test block:
    if (vma->vm_flags & VM_EXECUTABLE)
	    trs += pages;   /* text */
    else if (vma->vm_flags & VM_GROWSDOWN)
	    drs += pages;   /* stack */
    else if (vma->vm_end > 0x60000000)
	    lrs += pages;   /* library */
    else
	    drs += pages;
Is there any special reason for the hardcoded constant `0x60000000'?
In the Linux/m68k tree, we use TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE instead. But I don't know
why.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
