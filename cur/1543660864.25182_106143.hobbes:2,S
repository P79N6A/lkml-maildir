There's a good way to encode startup sequence info into the screen...it
doesn't require text.
WinXP outputs an image, starts it dim, fades it up to bright, starts a
sliding indicator, moves the slider back and forth at various speeds, then
starts the gui (?) and it goes more various steps.
I imagine someone with the right documentation could say exactly what's
going on at each step.
