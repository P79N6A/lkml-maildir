Subject: 2.6.9-rc2 hangs in posix_locks_deadlock

I was experiencing kernel hangs with versions 2.6.9-rc2 and
2.6.9-rc2-mm1 on two different boxes.
Today I managed to see the output of Alt+SysRq+P on the
hanged box and write down call trace (from screen, so it is incomplete).
EIP (c015da89) was in function posix_locks_deadlock,
and the call trace was:
 __posix_lock_file
 fcntl_setlk
Offending process was saslauthd (version 2.1.15)
