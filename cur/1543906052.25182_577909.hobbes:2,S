Well it really is different.
Simple test:
- run Unreal Tournament 99 (nice 0, it gets 98%,99% CPU most of the time)
- in a shell, `renice 20 $$; while :; do date; done;`
The shell only produces one or two outputs per second.
This seems different from the old-2.6 behavior, where a nice-20
process seemed to get a bit more share. (Due to interactivity bonus)
Does anyone have a cpu hog test program that spreads its cpu time
over the second rather than doing 300 ms wake and 700 ms sleep cycles
after another?

Send me patches, I run the test.
