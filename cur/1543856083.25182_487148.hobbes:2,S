Yes I think it will break reiserfs, so I just have to have a look
at converting it. Shouldn't take too long.

Well I guess this is your code, so it is up to you ;)
I would be happy if you come up with a quick fix, I'm just trying to
stamp out a few big bugs in mm. However I did prefer my way of moving
all the exapand code into generic_cont_expand, out of prepare_write, and
avoiding holding the target page locked while we're doing all the expand
work (strictly, you might be able to get away with this, but it is
fragile and ugly).
AFAIKS, the only reason to use prepare_write is to avoid passing the
get_block into generic_cont_expand?
Thanks,
Nick
