Add me to the list :-(.  Like the other folks reporting the softirq.c:206
panic problem, I've got a Cyrix.  Mine's a MII 300 (233 MHz).  Works fine
with 2.4.5 and prior kernels.  Didn't try any of the pre-2.4.6 or -ac
kernels.  Oops report available on request, but it's similar if not
identical to one I saw posted earlier.
