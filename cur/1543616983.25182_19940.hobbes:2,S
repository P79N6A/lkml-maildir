You haven't taken into consideration that not many distributions have
drivers in kernel, and in particular ISA device drivers. Namely because
ISA probes are ugly and require frobbing of memory in the vague hopes of
finding said device there. These probes may put ye old ISA device in a bad
state sometimes even hard locking your box, so chances are if the ISA
probe is in dmesg, the user explicitely decided to load the device. In
which case they already know what they have...
As an aside, i try not to use ISA and elegant in the same sentence ;)
