I see your point.  Yes, this is arguable ... there are multiple principles
that can be traded off against each other.
For example, "by default, make design choices that save memory" (what I was
using) versus:

For a kernel without CONFIG_MODULES, that's pure wasted space.  Why bother?
Those are devices that "can't be present", so that's one of the cases where
that "ignore the driver config" policy will indeed register such devices.
Similarly, when the driver's not yet written, it can make trouble to try
sticking its config into the device tree ... it's very easy to get wrong!
It's clear to me there are some cases where software config will reasonably
be a subset of the hardware config.  Likewise, that memory usage should be
one of the factors considered when making design tradeoffs.
