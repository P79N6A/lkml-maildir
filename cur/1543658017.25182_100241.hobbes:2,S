As others already pointed out, it's not always a good idea to do this
from kernel space. However, if you still want to do it, see snippet
below. If you want to write, you have to copy kernel_read() from
fs/exec.c and modify it for writing.
Regards, Olaf.

#include <linux/fs.h>
struct file *filp;
unsigned long offset = 0;
char buf[1024];
int n;
filp = filp_open("/path/to/some/file", O_RDONLY, 0);
if (!filp || IS_ERR(filp)) {
   /* do some error handling */
}
n = kernel_read(filp, offset, buf, sizeof(buf));
if (n != sizeof(buf)) {
   /* do some checking */
}
filp_close(filp, 0);
