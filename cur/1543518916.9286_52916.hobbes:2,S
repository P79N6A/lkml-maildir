Hi,
When i try to ls in a cfs:ed dir with a large amount of files in 2.3.31
(and all other 2.3 i've tried) it hangs. If i ls in a dir with only
few files it works as it should.
Here's the strace:
..
-- open(".", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_DIRECTORY) = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0711, st_size=16384, ...}) = 0
fcntl(3, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)           = 0
brk(0x805b000)                          = 0x805b000
getdents(3,  <unfinished ...>    <- it hangs here
..
What's causing this? In 2.2 it was working fine. I have recompiled
cfsd and it still happens.
Could it have something to do with knfsd ? But since i had that in 2.2 too
i dont think it has something to do with that.
