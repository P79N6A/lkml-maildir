I want to pass ext2 specific mount options for mounting /
At the moment I'm using raw_params in init/main.c. Now:
Did I miss a more general solution to mount root 
with FS(ext2)-specific mount options?
If not, is there a need for a general solution? Sth like:
checksetup(char *line)
{
...
	for(all filesystems)
		strncmp(filesystem->name, line, strlen(filesystem->name));
}
