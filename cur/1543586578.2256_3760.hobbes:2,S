Ultra100 is okay.
FastTrack is not.
I have no choice since the motherboard has the chip on-board and with
FastTrack BIOS.
I am hoping Andre will come up with something so that I can use this
motherboard.
I don't care much about the Fasttrack RAID part but I do want to utilize its
ATA100 capability.
