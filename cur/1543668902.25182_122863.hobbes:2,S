Hi
In 2.5.66-mm3, using a PCMCIA network card (3c574_cs), a APM suspend/resume
causes the network interface configuration to be lost. In previous kernels this
the interface configuration is preserved.
I also get the following messages written to the console, presumably these
messages are KERN_EMERG temporarily for debugging.
