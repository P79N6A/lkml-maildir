I's like to amplify this, adding more general purpose cpu to a machine 
strikes me as the right design choice since they're simply more generally 
useful than dedicated cpu's. look at linux software raid compared to the 
alternatives, frankly I haven't seen a hardware controller that can touch 
it for performance given a similar number of disks and interfaces... 
Currently graphcas card have substantionaly more memory bandwidth and 
pipelines than most general purpose cpu's but eventually that won't be the 
case. as it is gpus still represent the biggest chunk of independat 
computational power in a and at least on the server side we don't even 
use them.

Between hyper-transport tunnels, pci-x, pci-express and infinband, the 
bottlnecks between the cpu core and the perhiperals and memory are falling 
away at a rapid clip even as cpu's get faster. we're in a much better 
position to build balanced systems then we were 2 years ago.
