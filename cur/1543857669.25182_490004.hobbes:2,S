I didn't see that patch until you mentioned it. Even still, there seems
to be one thing missing. I suspect you still want to take the bmdma
resource since both native and legacy use it. With the patch you
mentioned, that resource wont be requested in legacy mode.
Also, I did my patch as detailed as it is because of this line:
	/* TODO: What if one channel is in native mode ... */
If that's never going to be the case then the comment should go. If it
is possible, then my patch makes this work. The way things are now, it
will ignore a native mode port if it is sitting on the same controller
as a legacy mode one.
Want to re-evaluate the patch based on this info?
