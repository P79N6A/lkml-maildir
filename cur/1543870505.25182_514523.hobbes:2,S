Not really.  I basically release them as quickly as I can, given that it
takes pretty much a full day to get a release compiling and pretending to
boot on various machines and configs.
I tend not to bother doing -mm releases during the two-week merge window
because a) I'm busy sending stuff and b) the upstream tree is changing too
fast and c) I'm busy watching people merrily merge things into mainline
which I've never seen before.

Nope.  Because it's almost never in a compileable state.  I don't see a lot
of point in publishing a known-broken tree - all people can do is to send
me little fixes for stuff which I'll quickly fix myself anyway.
I should upload snapshots more regularly to
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/mm/
 but there always
seems to be a reason not to.
