Try to write 512-byte sectors in random order, and I'm sure write
characteristics won't be that good.

Are you sure they do have NVRAM? What kind of NVRAM? Do they have backup
battery inside to keep NVRAM alive?

Wrong. AFAIK, first disks had FLASH with 512b blocks, then next
generation had 16K blocks, and currently most of cards have 128K
blocks. Besides, each page of a block (64 pages * 2K for 128K block) has
additional "system" area of 64 bytes. One thing that is in the system
area is bad block indicator (2 bytes) to mark some blocks as bad on
factory, and the rest could be used by application[1] the same way the
rest of the page is used. So physical block size is in fact 64 * (2048 +
64) = 135168 bytes.
Due to FLASH properties, it's a must to have ECC protection of the data
on FLASH, and AFAIK 22-bits ECC is stored for every 256 bytes of data,
so part of that extra memory on each page is apparently used for ECC
storage taking about 24 bytes out of those 64. I have no idea how the
rest of extra memory is used though.
BTW, the actual block size could be rather easily found from outside, --
just compare random access write speed against sequential write speed
using different number of 512b sectors as a write unit. Increase number
of sectors in a write unit until you get a jump in random access write
performance, -- that will give you the number of sectors in the block.
[1] By application here I mean the code that works inside the CF card
and deals with the FLASH directly. This memory is invisible from outside
of CF card.
