I would disagree personally. The more I play with the GUI tools provided by 
bitkeeper the more interesting things i discover. For example actually 
SEEING how patches fit together, being able to see what each patch did, 
looking at a file and having each line annotated as to who added it and in 
which patch makes it easier for me to understand how the code I am trying 
to understand has evolved and why certain things are the way they are. But 
that is something very personal to me, others may not find it useful...

I really like the way bk citool works because it makes my changelogs a lot 
more useful as I actually see what I have changed when writing them. But 
again, that is just me...
Best regards,
