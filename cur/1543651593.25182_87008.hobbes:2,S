This is IMHO very desireable, but not part of POSIX capabilties and also
even more intrusive on the applications.
Even on Windows NT you do not have such User capabilties. With a good
namespace and ACL concept, you can get around it, most of the time.
(although a object based security is not always as good as a subject bound).
