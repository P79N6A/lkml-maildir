Hopefully all instances of the USB code doing that have now been fixed.
If anyone sees any USB code that uses the kernel stack for USB
transfers, please let me know so it can be fixed.
We (the USB group) have always known that this is a bug in our code, so
don't feel you can't change things just because the USB code might be
broken by it :)
thanks,
