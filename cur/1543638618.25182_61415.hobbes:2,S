PCI IDE controller chips in compatibility mode may exhibit the
following BAR0-3 values (sorted by likelihood of occurance):
most likely:  BAR0-3 are all zero
rare       :  BAR0-3 show the legacy IDE port values
very rare  :  BAR0-3 contain garbage
In fact, the best strategy is to *ignore* BAR0-3 in compatibility mode
because they have no meaning then!
