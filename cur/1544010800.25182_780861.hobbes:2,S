Linus,
Please pull from the 'merge' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulus/powerpc.git merge
to get three more commits that fix bugs causing kernel crashes on
powerpc.
Thanks,
Paul.

    powerpc/cell/axon-msi: Fix MSI after kexec
    
    Commit d015fe995 'powerpc/cell/axon-msi: Retry on missing interrupt'
    has turned a rare failure to kexec on QS22 into a reproducible
    error, which we have now analysed.
    
    The problem is that after a kexec, the MSIC hardware still points
    into the middle of the old ring buffer.  We set up the ring buffer
    during reboot, but not the offset into it.  On older kernels, this
    would cause a storm of thousands of spurious interrupts after a
    kexec, which would most of the time get dropped silently.
    
    With the new code, we time out on each interrupt, waiting for
    it to become valid.  If more interrupts come in that we time
    out on, this goes on indefinitely, which eventually leads to
    a hard crash.
    
    The solution in this commit is to read the current offset from
    the MSIC when reinitializing it.  This now works correctly, as
    expected.

    powerpc: Fix bootmem reservation on uninitialized node
    
    careful_allocation() was calling into the bootmem allocator for
    nodes which had not been fully initialized and caused a previous
    bug:  
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/10528/
  So, I merged a
    few broken out loops in do_init_bootmem() to fix it.  That changed
    the code ordering.
    
    I think this bug is triggered by having reserved areas for a node
    which are spanned by another node's contents.  In the
    mark_reserved_regions_for_nid() code, we attempt to reserve the
    area for a node before we have allocated the NODE_DATA() for that
    nid.  We do this since I reordered that loop.  I suck.
    
    This is causing crashes at bootup on some systems, as reported
    by Jon Tollefson.
    
    This may only present on some systems that have 16GB pages
    reserved.  But, it can probably happen on any system that is
    trying to reserve large swaths of memory that happen to span other
    nodes' contents.
    
    This commit ensures that we do not touch bootmem for any node which
    has not been initialized, and also removes a compile warning about
    an unused variable.

    powerpc: Check for valid hugepage size in hugetlb_get_unmapped_area
    
    It looks like most of the hugetlb code is doing the correct thing if
    hugepages are not supported, but the mmap code is not.  If we get into
    the mmap code when hugepages are not supported, such as in an LPAR
    which is running Active Memory Sharing, we can oops the kernel.  This
    fixes the oops being seen in this path.
