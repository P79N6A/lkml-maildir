Wasn't part of the LSM setup done in a way that there would be "default"
handlers for the hooks for normal PID/capability checking in the absence
of another LSM module?  I thought that was one of the reasons LSM hooks
were accepted into the kernel, since this would allow even the default
file/process permission checks to be compiled out for, say, embedded
systems that only run as root anyways.
Couldn't that be used to do the trusted-namespace- means-CAP_SYS_ADMIN
checks, but it can be replaced by other LSM security modules if desired?
Cheers, Andreas
