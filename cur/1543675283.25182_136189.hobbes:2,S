OK, state changes can happen from several different
sources, and not all of these sources of input are
synchronized.
The spinlock in cp_timeout() does not synchronize
with input from sppp_input(), but *does* synchronize
with sppp_keepalive() which is run off another timer.
But I think I understand what Alan is getting at in
that the PPP state tables are designed to be tolerant
of transient oddities and should converge to a final
state regardless of a timing glitch/race.
Not worrying about state change synchronization and
discarding the use of the spinlock in cp_timeout()
will remove the warning for that case.
But sppp_keepalive() uses a spinlock to synchronize
access to the linked list of sppp devices. So this
path can also cause the warning.
So there are multiple places that call dev_queue_xmit()
with spinlocks held, which provokes this warning.
Which makes me wonder:
Was it really the intention of the change to kernel/softirq.c:105
(source of the warning) that callers to dev_queue_xmit()
not be allowed to use spinlocks? If so, then what other
synchronization techniques are appropriate for use in
an interrupt and timer context?
