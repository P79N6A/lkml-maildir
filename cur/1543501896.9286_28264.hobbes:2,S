	My only comment on this, mixed systems.  For example, I use a
fair number of Sangoma S508 units, they will do Cisco HDLC, SyncPPP,
X25, and Frame in *firmware*.  It would however be nice to piggyback
in some cases, such as running kernel ppp over frame relay (ppp
session bound to a particular PVC/DLCI) (with the frame being done in
card firmware).  Customers are needing PPP over frame support for IDSL
service, as few of them can talk native frame and depend on the telco
dropping their syncppp session onto frame and giving it to me via the
frame cloud.  As of now it looks like I am stuck picking up a Cisco to
support this (a very sad thing, as to date ALL my routers of any type
are Linux based and I am very, very happy with them.
