	Objective-C - now that's a cool language. Took me 4 hours
to learn, and the `% of code that worked as I expected the 
first time it compiled' index - one of my favorite measues -
is somewhere around 95% for me. Whereas C is around 80%, and
C++ is about 50% or less.
	Objective-C is _much_ less ``surprising'' to the new programmer 
than C++, and the ``pace of development'' is far faster, but the runtime 
is slightly slower due to the use of dynamic messaging..
	(Think C + Smalltalk = Objective C)
