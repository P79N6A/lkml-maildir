We should be able to use dma_addr_t for this?  Is it not the case that the
values we're dealing with here _are_ DMA addresses?  I think a more complete
description of the problem we're trying to solve here would help.
I'm not sure what the problem is with sparc64 - perhaps its dma_addr_t
really is a "cookie" and isn't a physical bus address?  But you want a value
which is really a physical bus address?  Dunno.
Perhaps dma64_addr_t can be used here.
