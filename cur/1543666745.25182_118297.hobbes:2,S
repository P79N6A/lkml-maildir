???  That's with 2.5.65 today or your patch?  Hm, ok, I see with your
patch, how it will generate the above result.
But the fact that the tty core today abuses major numbers by overloading
them is no reason to try to fix that broken behavior.
:)
Anyway, it's a minor nit, I just would prefer to have a "num_minors"
request, but am fine with your patch as is for right now.
Nice job.
thanks,
