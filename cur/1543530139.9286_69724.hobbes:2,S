Fixed
-----
Tulip hang on rmmod (fixed in .51 ?)
Incredibly slow loopback tcp bug (believed fixed about 2.3.48)
COMX series WAN now merged
In Progress
-----------
Merge the network fixes  (DaveM)
Merge 2.2.15 changes  (Alan)
Get RAID 0.90 in 	 (Ingo)
Fix Exists But Isnt Merged
--------------------------
Signals leak kernel memory (security)
msync fails on NFS
Semaphore races
Sempahore memory leak
Exploitable leak in file locking
Symbol clashes and other mess from _three_ copies of zlib!
Shared memory changes change the API breaking applications (eg gimp)
Merge the RIO driver (probably do post 2.4.0 as it is large)
To Do
-----
Restore O_SYNC functionality
Fix eth= command line
vmalloc(GFP_DMA) is needed for DMA drivers
VM needs rebalancing
Fix SPX socket code
put_user appears to be broken for i386 machines
Fix module remove race bug		(mostly done - Al Viro)
Test other file systems on write
Directory race fix for UFS
Audit all char and block drivers to ensure they are safe with the 2.3
	locking - a lot of them are not especially on the open() path.
Stick lock_kernel() calls around driver with issues to hard to fix nicely
	for 2.4 itself
PCMCIA/Cardbus hangs, IRQ problems, Keyboard/mouse problem (related ?)
Use PCI DMA by default in IDE is unsafe (must not do so on via VPx x<3)
Use PCI DMA 'lost interrupt' problem with some hw [which ?]
Crashes on boot on some Compaqs ?
pci_set_master forces a 64 latency on low latency setting devices.Some
	boards require all cards have latency <= 32
To Do But Non Showstopper
-------------------------
Make syncppp use new ppp code
Finish 64bit vfs merges (lockf64 and friends missing)
NCR5380 isnt smp safe
DMFE is not SMP safe
ACPI hangs on boot for some systems
Get the Emu10K merged
Finish I2O merge
Go through as 2.4pre kicks in and figure what we should mark obsolete for
	the final 2.4
Per Process rtsigio limit
Boot hangs on a range of Dell docking stations (Latitude)
Port SGI VisWS to 2.3.x or mark obsolete
S/390 Merge
HFS is still broken
iget abuse in knfsd
Mark NTFS as obsolete
via rhine oopses under load (softnet ?)
Paride seems to need fixes for the block changes yet
PIII FXSAVE/FXRESTORE support
Some people report 2.3.x serial problems
SB1000 doesnt work (mostly fixed - AC working on this)
Compatibility Errors
--------------------
Probably Post 2.4
-----------------
per super block write_super needs an async flag
addres_space needs a VM pressure/flush callback
per file_op rw_kiovec
enhanced disk statistics
AFFS fixups
UMSDOS fixups resync
Drivers In 2.2 not 2.4
----------------------
Lan Media WAN
To Check
--------
Truncate races (Debian apt shows it nicely) [done ? - all but Coda]
Elevator and block handling queue change errors are all sorted
Check O_APPEND atomicity bug fixing is complete
Make sure all drivers return 1 from their __setup functions
Finish softnet driver port over and cleanups
Page cache high on PAE36 boxes is very slow, maybe disable ?
Protection on isize  (sct) [Al Viro mostly done]
Mikulas claims we need to fix the getblk/mark_buffer_uptodate thing for
	2.3.x as well
Network block device seems broken by block device changes
Fbcon races
Fix all remaining PCI code to use new resources and enable_Device
VFS?VM - mmap/write deadlock
initrd is bust
rw sempahores on page faults (mmap_sem)
kiobuf seperate lock functions/bounce/page_address fixes
Fix routing by fwmark
Some FB drivers check the A000 area and find it busy then bomb out
rw semaphores on inodes to fix read/truncate races ? [Probably fixed]
Not all device drivers are safe now the write inode lock isnt taken on write
File locking needs checking for races
Multiwrite IDE breaks on a disk error
AFFS doesn't work on current page cache
