Hmm, trying to do this (with 2.6.19-rc1-git2) seems to have revealed
yet another problem.
If I try to switch to tty1 just after boot, everything is fine. It's
still fine after using the box for a few minutes doing random stuf
like reading email, surfing the web etc, but once my build script has
been running for a few minutes (tested 2 times after ~5min. runs) I
just get a completely white screen when switching to tty1, and when
switching back to X I also just get a white screen :-(
Something is definately broken here....
