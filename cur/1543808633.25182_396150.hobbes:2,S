The thing is, I'd like to be able to set up a CDRW for packet writing and burn
some data there (not necessarily UDF filesystem, it should be able to, for
example, undergo encryption; and it may not be UDF filesystem at all) without
actually having to use UDF and packet writing on the burning side...
That is: Set up CDRW for packet writing. Burn something non-UDF there. Move it
elsewhere. Use packet writing to access it r/w. Can I do that?:) I've been
playing with cdrecord's -packet and pktsize options atm, the only thing I got
was a CDRW that apparently blocks all reading.
