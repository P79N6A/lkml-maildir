I have the same problem at home, I changed something in the .asoundrc
and it went away. it still plays a little bit skippy, but better than
suddenly stop.
I had this problem on a Sony Laptop (GRX series) with an i8x0 chipsetz
and a yamaha soundchip (which is controlled by the i8x0 drivers).
I can give more info if needed.
