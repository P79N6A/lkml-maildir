pgscan             2751953        5328260  <== ? hmm
kswapd_steal        380282         522126
pageoutrun            1107           1956
allocstall            3472           1238
- we scan far less pages
- kswapd reclaims less pages
- we go into the pageout code less often
- allocations stall more often for a lack of free memory
cheers,
Rik
