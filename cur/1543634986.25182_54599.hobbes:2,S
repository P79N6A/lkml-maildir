Unfortunately, many of the code paths leading to the races are
sufficiently different that it's currently unlikely to actually
hit them. (E.g. it's kind of hard for some 1000+ instructions
code path to compete successfully with a cached, pre-fetched,
and pre-decoded "ret" instruction. Entry-after-removal races
(and the related data races) may be a little bit easier to catch,
but I suppose we're still talking about a likely difference of
orders of magnitude.)
I don't think preemption changes that fundamentally.
Microthreading may, and NUMA will make execution times more
variable, increasing the risk of hitting a race.
The best way to trigger such races is probably to simulate
microthreading, e.g. with an UML-SMP where only one "CPU" can
run at a time, and where execution switching is under script
control.
