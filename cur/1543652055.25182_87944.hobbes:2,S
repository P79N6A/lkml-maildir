This is only feasible for small numbers of cpus. Any compensation
provided by algorithmic improvements on the read-side is outweighed by
NR_CPUS. Making readers well-behaved only solves half of the issue.
Whether the other half is addressible in a 2.6.x time scale is an open
question, but a question I'd like to see answered in favor of fixing
the livelocks sooner rather than later (esp. as 2.7+ issues are unlikely
to be resolved in line with hardware release schedules). I have a
strong bias toward code which works everywhere, all the time.
