Hi,
I had the same problem, then I realized that at the same time
the machine's BogoMIPS fell like an apoplectic hawk.
(Bored of the Rings(TM))
Disable PM timer in the kernel config or use the
"clock=tsc" command line for the kernel. Or use a
later -mm kernel that has a fix in the pmtmr code
and use tsc for short delays. This can cause timing
inaccuracy on variable clocked CPUs.
