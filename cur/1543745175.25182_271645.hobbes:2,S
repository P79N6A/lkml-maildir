ksymoops takes the Code: line, converts it to a suitable object file,
passes that object to the arch specific disassembler then ksymoops
reformats the output to match the kernel symbol table.  With fixed
length instructions, ksymoops can dump the entire code line into a
single object.  With variable length instructions, disassembling the
code before the instruction pointer is dodgy, it may or may not work.
So for VLI code, ksymoops splits the code line into two separate pieces
and processes each one seperately.  ksymoops prints the first bit with
a warning that it may not be reliable.  The second bit, and all the
code line for non-VLI architectures, is reliable and is printed without
a warning.
The VLI tag, together with <> or [] around the failing instruction,
tells ksymoops if this oops needs to be processed in one chunk or two.
_Before_ passing the synthesized object(s) to the disassembler.
