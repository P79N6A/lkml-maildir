There was the SCHED_IDLE patch from Ingo too.

As I just pointed out for the SCHED_IDLE patch: doing that, you open a
window to deadlocking on semaphores.
To fix this properly (as pointed out by Pavel) you must be more clever and
see _where_ the process got rescheduled.

I just did something like that some time ago (probably Rik remeber).
I only changed `p->counter > current->counter + 3' to: 
	`p->counter + p->priority > current->counter + 3 + p->priority'
This make sense to me since we may want to reschedule the current task if
the wokenup one has very higer priority. But it's not a critical thing in
real-life (where all processes are used to run at the same priority), it's
just a thought.
