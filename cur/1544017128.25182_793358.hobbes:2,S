Okay :-) I missed the detail that it iterates down groups as well, if done

the cpu_clock() uses the rq lock just as much - it's the same basic 
scheduler time they are using.
We could drop the rq clock, but i found that the timec output gets a bit 
ugly that way, if used with multiple sw counters.
Instead of getting neat output like:
 $ timec -e -2,-2,-2,-2 ls
 [...]
  Performance counter stats for 'ls':
       2.830582  task clock ticks     (msecs)
       2.830582  task clock ticks     (msecs)
       2.830582  task clock ticks     (msecs)
       2.830582  task clock ticks     (msecs)
       2.830582  task clock ticks     (msecs)
  Wall-clock time elapsed:    46.353323 msecs
We get something like (mockup, from memory):
  Performance counter stats for 'ls':
       2.830431  task clock ticks     (msecs)
       2.830582  task clock ticks     (msecs)
       2.830613  task clock ticks     (msecs)
       2.830781  task clock ticks     (msecs)
       2.831100  task clock ticks     (msecs)
  Wall-clock time elapsed:    46.353323 msecs
As each individual counter is sampled differently.
But i'd like to drop the rq lock in any case - it's not really needed from 
a scheduling POV. Maybe we could take the current sched time once, save it 
and reuse that in the sw counters (instead of each sw counter taking that 
time individuall)?

there's an evil plan behind my use of cpu_clock() / sum_exec_runtime: that 
way if the scheduler folks break those metrics the performance analysis 
folks immediately notify us of our stupidity ;-) It's also the metrics 
that 'top' and 'time' use - so it's a bit more natural to use - these 
things should work together and break together. The scheduler's deadline 
logic also uses this metric so there's synergy.
I think if we do the time-sampling approach i suggested above the locking 
and overhead problem disappears and we can just use cpu_clock() or 
sum_exec_runtime once, and use it from the sw counter(s)?
