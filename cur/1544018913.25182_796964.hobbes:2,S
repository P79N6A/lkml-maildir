Linus's open development policy was the very opposite of
cathedral-building. Linux's Internet archives were burgeoning, multiple
distributions were being floated. And all of this was driven by an
unheard-of frequency of core system releases.
Linus was treating his users as co-developers in the most effective
possible way:
        7. Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
Linus's innovation wasn't so much in doing quick-turnaround releases
incorporating lots of user feedback (something like this had been
Unix-world tradition for a long time), but in scaling it up to a level
of intensity that matched the complexity of what he was developing. In
those early times (around 1991) it wasn't unknown for him to release a
new kernel more than once a day! Because he cultivated his base of
co-developers and leveraged the Internet for collaboration harder than
anyone else, this worked.
