Well, I suspect the tape is hanging the bus, from which no card can
recover.
Just to test this, can you try sending a bus reset with sgutils (from
the debain package sg3-utils):
sg_reset -b /dev/sg3
Then remove and re-add the device with
echo scsi remove-single-device 1 0 6 0 > /proc/scsi/scsi
echo scsi add-single-device 1 0 6 0 > /proc/scsi/scsi
And see if that brings it back.  If it doesn't I'm afraid the tape has
the bus locked and nothing can free it.
