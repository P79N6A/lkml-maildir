As all kernel thread (1) should be converted to kthread anyway for
proper containers support and general "let's get rid of a crappy API'
cleanups I think that's enough.  It would be nice to have SGI helping
to convert more drivers over to the proper API as conversions have stalled
a little bit.
(1) There's a few very core kernel threads that need to stick to the
    low-level API, but they're too few to make any differences.
