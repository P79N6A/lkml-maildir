The kernel-networkcode doesn't care about hostnames... That's done in
userspace (gethostbyname is a library-function, not a syscall)

Agree! I'm seeking myself for a way to send "hand-made" tcp/ip-packets
without having to care about the datalink-level-headers... This part has
changed since 2.0.x and now I'm _really_ stuck...
