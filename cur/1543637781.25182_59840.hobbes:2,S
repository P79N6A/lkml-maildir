I just wanted to add a "me too" on this. I'm also seeing rw-lock
starvation in do_gettimeofday(). While it does not lead to system
deadlock, it does cause the values returned from gettimeofday to loop as
the timer_bh cannot increment the xtime values (causing possible
application deadlock). In my case,the problem is exaggerated because I'm
using do_slowgettimeofffset due to TSC skew on the i386 hardware I'm
using.
