i've seen such problems (locked up box with endless loop of usage count 
== 1) with pppoe in the past, and it seemed to be related to dynamic 
IPs. (i saw that well before 2.6.24 - reported it once to davem)
It seems to have stopped when i stopped using ipsec and started using 
vpnc. (but no firm info - this was sporadic - happened every few months 
or so) Are you using ipsec and dynamic IPs by any chance?
