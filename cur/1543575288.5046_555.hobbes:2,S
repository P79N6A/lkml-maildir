This is great when you have buffersize==pagesize.  When there are
multiple buffers per page it means that some of the buffers might have
to wait for flushing just because bdflush started IO on some other
buffer on the same page.  Oh well.  The common case improves in terms
being proveably correct and the uncommon case gets worse a tiny bit. 
It sounds like a win.
We are moving steadily away from buffer oriented I/O anyway, and I
think we can optimize the case of buffersize!=pagesize in 2.5 by being a
little more careful about how getblk hands out buffers.  Getblk
could force all buffers on the same page to be on the same
major/minor, or even better, to be physically close together.  Or
more simply, flush_dirty_buffers could check for other dirty buffers on
the same page and initiate I/O at the same time.  Or both strategies.
This is by way of buttressing an argument in favor of simplicity
and reliabilty, i.e., being religious about taking the page lock, even
when there's a slight cost in the short term.
