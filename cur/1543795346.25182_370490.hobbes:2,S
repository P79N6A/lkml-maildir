Right on the k8 memory controller there is a lot of overlap,
with what has already been implemented.  For all other x86 memory
controllers the code is filling a large void.  The current k8
code has been delayed for this reason.
Where the EDAC code goes beyond the current k8 facilities is the
decode to the dimm level so that the bad memory stick can be
easily identified.
One of the goals of the EDAC code is to work towards a unified
kernel architecture for this kind error reporting.  Currently every
architecture (if the error are reported at all) handles this
differently which makes it very hard to do something sane is
user space.
