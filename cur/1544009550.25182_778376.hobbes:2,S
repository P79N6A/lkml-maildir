I think you can safely rule out NIC, I'm also seeing this behaviour on a
brand new server with imap hanging in some busy-loop.
Network card in my case:
Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme II BCM5708 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 12)
What I observer was one CPU doing 100% system work, and the number of
timer interrupts went from 1k per second to 4k (for the whole system).
I didn't report it because I thought it's one of patches I have to blame.
Oh, and, unfortunately, I can't bisect, I'm seeing this only on one machine
that has to be running.
