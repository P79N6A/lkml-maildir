Nope.  I'm just doing the absolute minimum.  Others have suggested using
Lindent and friends, but that would result in the undesirable
side-effects you've pointed out, and for little or no gain.  So, I for
one, will _not_ be doing that.
Obfuscating real authorship is a definite problem however.  But I'm
confident that you and your Bitkeeper elves can come up with a good
solution to this.  Surely this problem must slop over into other areas.
