And as an interesting data point all a triple fault does on a modern
system is to put the cpu in a weird stopped state.  Some hardware
usually the southbridge then detects this and if properly configured
will trigger the reset line.
I believe this may actually go back into history as far as the 486 but
I have not done the researched to see how far back this behavior goes.
