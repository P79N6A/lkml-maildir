I have a Vaio Z600TEK (Same CPU iirc as above Vaio), and also get
that message.  The thing is, I'm not entirely sure the mobile P3 has
a fully working APIC.
When I tried to get oprofile to work on it, I eventually gave up,
as reading certain registers returned nonsense. Some seem ok, but
others (like the version field return -1).
regards,
Dave.
