Then explicitly prevent the cases which cannot work in the clone()
calls.  Yes, giving people rope to shoot themselves is a Unix tradition
but it's so unnecessary in this case and will only cause support
problems for innocent people.

need to enforce every other namespace as well.  There are simply too
many dependencies.
