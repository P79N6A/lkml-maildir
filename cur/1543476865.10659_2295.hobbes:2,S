I apologize advance for my extreme lack of knowledge in linux development
of any kind.  I am only presuming to post to this list under the advice of
a friend.
I want to make it impossible for daemons to be started under any UID
that is greater than 100, except for UID 65534.
Some suggested that I make a patch for my kernel that would do something
such as:
if UID > 100  and UID != 65534
  then "do not open socket"
I know very very little about programming (I am just a beginning
programmer) and I certainly don't know anything about kernel programming.
I was wondering if anyone knew what lines of code I would have to add to
the kernel in order to achieve this effect, and where in the kernel source
should I add it?
I would be extremely appreciate of any assistance you could give me.
Thank you very much.  :)
