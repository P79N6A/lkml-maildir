Hello!
> In  this  case,  would  they  be  packets  TO  or FROM the ppp device?
FROM, of course. When a packet reaches IP, the device is already destroyed.
This is impossible, unless driver is broken or we have an error
in reference counting. The second possibility is eliminated by the fact,
that you do not see "Freeing alive device". So, device was cleanly
unregistered.

I will look. It sounds as an interesting hint.

In no way.

It is not a nonsense. However, iptables hold necessary reference counts.

This is not essential.

Well, ifconfig can be racy. If some device sitting in the list before ppp96
was deleted while ifconfig scanned the list, you can see ppp96 twice.
If some device was added, ifconfig can lose some device. Awkward, of course.
