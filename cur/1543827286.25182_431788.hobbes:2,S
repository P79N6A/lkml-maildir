The patch Christoph is referring to, together with a small fix by Andrew 
Morton, is in -mm and is IMO ready to go into Linux 2.6.18. However this 
patch converts only the khpsbpkt (packet/ transactions handler), not the 
knodemgrd (bus management and protocol driver dispatcher).
Serge, could you reduce your patch to the nodemgr part and resubmit? A 
diff against current -mm would be most welcome. If you develop on top of 
Linus' tree, you could get current 1394 subsystem code which is almost 
identical to latest -mm here:
