Hi Michal/Pavel
Both of you are right. Qualcomm is not offering source codes for the drivers (at
 least, there is no way to find the drivers on their site, and they
are probably not
asking for MSM based devices to advertise *drivers available* or such), nor the
iguana source code contains the drivers. Licenses are needless until violated.
