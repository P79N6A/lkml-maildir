Sorry, other than the already suggested use of nameif I don't see any 
other good way to do it. At some point the hardware should pass through 
the hands of someone who DOES know Linux enough to read the MAC address 
off the sticker usually found on the NIC, and set the config to match.
You better label the back of the NICs, if your customer can't identify 
the one with the blinking light (as previously suggested) they may have 
problems with UNIX terms like upper and lower ;-)
