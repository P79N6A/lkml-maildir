I don't have a problem with a samples/ directory except (as I have
already pointed out) it means that people will end up having to look
in 2 places for the information that they need, i.e., both in
samples/ and in Documentation/.  So I really don't see a big need
to split the samples and docs.
What's wrong with building sample code in the Documentation/ directory?
