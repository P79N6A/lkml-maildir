Hi,
I would like just to report a very good feeling of the multitasking in
pre7 (maybe the VM changes).
Netscape loads a lot faster, but the major improvement was accessing my
SparQ driver (paride). Now I can access my Sparq and do a lot of things
at the same time (much better than pre5)
Great job.
Dino
