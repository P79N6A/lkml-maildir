And those parts that are C++ (from a 2 year old eCos dist) won't
compile with a modern g++.  I tried to compile RedBoot on a Fedora
Core 5 system and it was a very painful experience, old deprecated C++
code was breaking all over the place.  It may just have been the the
eCos configuration tool (which I belive is written in C++) that failed
to compile, but anyway, I had to use an older version of g++ and some
flag to make the old broken C++ code generate warnings, not errors.
