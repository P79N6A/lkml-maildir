I did some more testing and it turns out that I was not using the via
IDE driver but some generic code. I had the IDE driver as a module and
it was loaded but it did only drive the two unused ports the generic
driver had control over the DVD drive. I removed CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC and
compiled the via driver into the kernel and everything work OK now. 
I wonder why the generic code blocks interrupts but now I'm not that
interested in this problem anymore :)
