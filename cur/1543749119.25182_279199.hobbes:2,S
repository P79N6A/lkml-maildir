These messages I have gotten for years.  They're debugging messages,
as a result of:
register_netdevice()
  alloc_divert_blk()
     (sees it's not an ethernet device, printk's the message)
So I believe they're harmless.

It looks like pty_chars_in_buffer() dereferenced a NULL function
pointer, but I don't see how that can be, the one deference is tested
for NULL before doing so.
I can't rule out the ppp_mppe code, but I haven't seen this crash
before myself.  Does this happen on simlar systems that aren't running poptop?
Thanks,
Matt
