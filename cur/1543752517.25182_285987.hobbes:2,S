Each patch (including security fixes) in the mainline kernels (2.4 and
2.6) appears there as an individual, clickable link with a description
(e.g. "1.1551  Paul Starzetz: sys_uselib() race vulnerability
(CAN-2004-1235)").
If other patches have gone in since then, you may have to scroll through
a (short-form) changelog. However, it's still less frustrating than the
scenario you portray.
