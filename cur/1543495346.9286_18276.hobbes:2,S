I posted yesterday about the weirdnesses I encountered with RH 6.0
on a P5-133.  I received numerous suggestions, so I wanted to tell
the group what the answer really was.
It was the CD drive, not memory.  Several people suggested that 
it might be the CD, and one person mentioned that there was some
trouble between Linux and Goldstar CD drives (or perhaps just one 
model from that company, I forget).  My CD drive is an Aztech ATAPI,
model CDA 668-01I, but since I happened to have a Mitsumi ATAPI
sitting on the shelf, I figured I'd try it, and it worked.
The only change from the (numerous) prior bad installations to this one
was the CD drive.  All hardware, BIOS settings, configuration selections,
installation media, etc., were identical.
Since I've had no trouble with this drive and other OS's (including
RH 5.1 and 5.2), this still leaves unanswered the question of exactly
what happened here.  If anyone would like more information on this,
please ask me, either in the list or via private e-mail.
My sincere thanks to everyone who offered suggestions and explanations.
Lou
