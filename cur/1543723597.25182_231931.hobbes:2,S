I'm no PM expert, but I'm getting the idea that you're wrong at your
principles. 
To begin with, there's no such thing as acpi calls. There's driver model in
2.6 (i.e. pci_module_init() / pci_register_driver()), and there's 2.4's
lack of thereof (i.e. pm_register()). As far as I know, those two
interfaces have nothing specifically to do with ACPI nor APM. 
I think the proper way to conditionalize this in the code is to check for
CONFIG_PM as the prerequisite and KERNEL_2_6/!KERNEL_2_6 to choose between
those interfaces (and only that: bear in mind swsusp2 and pmdisk require
neither APM nor ACPI). Perhaps you're building with only CONFIG_PM defined?
Hopefully others will be able to clarify this.
Best regards,
