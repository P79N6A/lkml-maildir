I eventually had special-case handling of IDTAG_PID so that it did not
use idtags, but chained tasks directly, and removing the pidhash as goals.

ISTR the idtag_lock was for cases where the hashtable was modified
while the tasklist_lock was only held for reading. Basically, once
those are resolved, the idtag_lock goes away.
