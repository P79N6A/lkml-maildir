Yes - well said.  And I have this strange tendency to see all the
worlds problems as opportunities for cpuset solutions <grin>.

I would not expect taskstat users to monitor for such changes.
I'd expect them to monitor the stats from whatever is in the
cpuset they named.  If a task moves out of that cpuset to another,
then tough -- that task will no longer be monitored by that
particular monitoring request.
Cpusets do provide a convenient middle ground, as you say, which
is really useful for reducing scaling issues such as this one to
a managable size.
Per-cpu is too fine grained, and per-system too coarse.
An unnecessary tying - yes.  But perhaps a useful one.
