Subject: [PATCH] documentation: how to use DOC: section blocks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
Add info on how to use DOC: sections in kernel-doc.
DOC: sections enable the addition of inline source file comments
that are general in nature instead of being specific to a
function, struct, union, enum, or typedef.

+Including documentation blocks in source files
+----------------------------------------------
+
+To facilitate having source code and comments close together, you can
+include kernel-doc documentation blocks that are free-form comments
+instead of being kernel-doc for functions, structures, unions,
+enums, or typedefs.  This could be used for something like a
+theory of operation for a driver or library code, for example.
+
+This is done by using a DOC: section keyword with a section title.  E.g.:
+
+/**
+ * DOC: Theory of Operation
+ *
+ * The whizbang foobar is a dilly of a gizmo.  It can do whatever you
+ * want it to do, at any time.  It reads your mind.  Here's how it works.
+ *
+ * foo bar splat
+ *
+ * The only drawback to this gizmo is that is can sometimes damage
+ * hardware, software, or its subject(s).
+ */
+
+DOC: sections are used in SGML templates files as indicated below.
