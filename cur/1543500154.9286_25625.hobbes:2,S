I have not really found txqueuelen to be very helpful.  The default for
ppp seems to be 10 and I see no real difference at 3 or 1.  What *does*
seem to make a difference is a combination of that and setting the
window using "route" to about 8192, which seems to still give good all
out speed and good interactivity when a background transfer or two are
going on.  The txqueuelen of 3 may or may not be necessary but I do it
anyway.
