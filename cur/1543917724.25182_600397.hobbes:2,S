I'm not sure this was discussed on the list, but as long as Casey doesn't
get rid of the magic symlinks (smackfs_follow_link), there's a clear NACK
from the VFS perspective.
Otherwise the code looks pretty well written, alhough a run through
checkpath.pl to fix the lose end might help.  Oh, and please to compile-time
initializations for the spinlocks and mutex currently initializes in
smack_init.  Also the -Inet/netlabel looks rather odd, please work with
the netlabel maintainer to move the required files to the include/
hierachy.
