... 15 to 9 hours ago it was all out, and majordomo failed during that
about 6 hours.  (About 14th Jul 23:00 UTC to 15th Jul 04:00 UTC)

Several log files failed to log (or rotate), Majordomo failed to create
temporary files, and didn't detect it, thus messages got lost...
D'uh..  These should never happen, but still they do :-/
