Yes, I have tried it. It doesn't work. 
The machine reboots always after the watchdog timeout set in the BIOS. I've
tried with the example watchdog daemon from the watchdog.txt, and with the
Debian "watchdog" package.
When I enable the debug messages and logging in the Debian watchdog package,
I can see that the watchdog daemon gets stuck while trying to update the
/dev/watchdog.. so the driver hangs..
