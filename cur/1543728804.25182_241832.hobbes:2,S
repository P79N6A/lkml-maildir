This shows that we can make floppy probe fail,
but we also need to show that it can succeed.
If you enable the floppy in the BIOS does this
prink in bjorn's patch fire?:
+	printk("%s: found a controller at ACPI %s\n", DEVICE_NAME,
+               device->pnp.bus_id);
+       acpi_floppies_found++;
Also, it would be helpful to see the lines with LNKD
in the dmesg for floppy enabled and floppy disabled cases --
a 2.6.7 vintage kernel should work fine:
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] (IRQs 3 4 5 *6 7 10 11 12 14 15)
        ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] enabled at IRQ 6
If you can also run acpidmp in both those scenarios
(any kernel version, ACPI enabled or disabled should do)
and send me the two output files, that would be great.
thanks,
-Len
ps. you can get acpidmp in /usr/sbin/ or from pmtools here
