Hello there
After some hard work we managed to get SUSE 6.2 running 
on an athlon(K7) with a microstar 6167 motherboard.
We're still having some problems, and it would be nice if some of you 
could help us:
1. X11 crashes the machine hard no matter what graphiccard we put in
   the machine. We suspect MTRR to be the problem as we had to
   use a SUSE boot floppy in order to get the machine working in the
   first place (problems with MTRR)
   Our plan is to compile 2.2.12 pre 3 (is it 3?) which should give
   MTRR support for the Athlon
2. If we put all of the 3*128M in the motherboard it becomes
   unstable. We suspected one bad piece of ram, but as long as we only
   populate any 2 of the 3 dimms (in any permutation) it's stable as a
   rock. Anyone seen this problem before?
Btw. Isn't there some kind of archive over the posts on this list?
Yours Thomas
