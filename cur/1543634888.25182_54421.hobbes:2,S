Hi,
I tried
  2.4.18 + acpi-20020611
and
  2.4.18 + acpi-20020611 + pciirq-27
but both of them freeze the same way :(.
I noticed that it is not an immediate freeze though. alt-sysrq-T works for
about 5 seconds... after that, nothing.
If you do think the call traces would do help, I might take time to do
write them down.
