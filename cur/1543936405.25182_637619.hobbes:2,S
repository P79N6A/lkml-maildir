Those dts files are for embedded devices that were specifically
developed for Linux. All of the PowerPC Macs in the world have a
device tree in ROM that was developed by Apple following the Open
Firmware standard. Same thing for Sun boxes, but I'm not working on
those.
The kernel has an existing mechanism for handling translations like
these, the alias scheme.

Currently developers add entries to the table in their private builds
for the i2c devices they are using. Another way to avoid adding a
table entry is to create a platform device in the platform code. But
this support is being extended to audio codecs too. There are hundreds
of audio codecs.
The whole purpose of this code is to dynamically load the correct i2c
and audio drivers by reading the device tree instead of having static
i2s/codec devices for every possible platform combination.
