On a RAID controller with battery backed write-back cache, it can
complete a "sync" operation as soon as the data is in the controller
cache.   This gives a significant performance speedup.
If the cache is not battery backed and power is lost after such a "sync"
operation, then data that the kernel/userspace thought was sync'ed to
disk is actually lost.
This *will* break journalling filesystems and databases.  They work from
the assumption that 'sync' means 'sync' - and if it doesn't, then all
hell breaks lose.
It is common to enforce ordering of writes by issuing a 'sync' of some
data and after the sync completes then starting the writeout of the
'next' data.  On a controller with write-back cache without battery
backup, you could actually risk that your 'next' data were written
before the data you just issued a 'sync' for.
In other words;  write-back cache without battery backup is absolutely
insane, except for some few isolated cases, such as swap-space that Alan
pointed out.
