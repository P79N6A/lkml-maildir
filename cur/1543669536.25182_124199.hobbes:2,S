it shouldn't be that hard, it was one of the 6 OS projects for the
regular 4000 level (senior/grad) level OS class here at columbia last
semster.  
The assignment was to modify ext2 to support versioning, basically means
making a copy of it within ext2's open, if it's opened O_RDWR.  The
assignment was a little bit more complicated in that we took an ext2
flag bit to mean "version", so that a file would only be versioned if
the bit was set, as well as only allowing a single level of versioning,
though extending it w/ more wouldn't be that hard.
The student solutions (as well as our sample solution) weren't that
"pretty", but then again, each project was only for 2-2.5 weeks.
