That's the advantage of such drivers.
I see at least two disadvantages:
First, it doesn't encourage hardware manufacturers to support open 
source development.
Linux has only a small market share, but it's slowly growing.
Linux driver support does sometimes influence the decision which 
hardware to buy.
With NdisWrapper, the hardware manufacturer can say:
  "Our hardware is supported through the open source NdisWrapper."
Without NdisWrapper, they will sometimes hear that people did choose to 
buy hardware from a different hardware manufacturer that has a Linux 
driver. This can make the hardware manufacturer more friendly towards 
open source development (e.g. by providing hardware specs).
Secondly, binary-only drivers have an impact on the stability of the 
Linux kernel.
E.g. during the last years the nvidia has produced relatively many 
kernel crashes - and I doubt that binary-only drivers for Windows are 
much better in this respect.
The users only see their kernel crashing blaming the Linux kernel and 
harming the reputation of the stability of Linux.
