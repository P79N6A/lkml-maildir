you mean presto_permission(), and yes, so that can be removed

the xattr struff needs attention anyway, and many
of the functions calling jfs_permission() directly or
indirectly will have the check at a higher layer ...

okay, but why not do it in permission(), and make
the few callers of vfs_permission use that one instead?
except for jfs_permission() and nfsd_permission()
(which is hell enough) there are no direct calls
of *_permission() ...

hmm, obviously you didn't read the patch at all, as that 
is exactly what I did, so please have a look at it ...

I don't see why, please enlighten me ...

hmm, well but how would moving the ro checks around
or adding them for the vfs mounts influence that?
I agree that this _is_ an issue but why should this _not_
happen with mount -o remount,ro /xy ?
