Ok, lets see. Random process does lock_super and then writes too much
data (=> wakeup_bdflush). Ok, now superblock is locked and bdflush is
called. But due to loop, bdflush tries to write to sparse block, which
can require lock_super. (Am I right)? Is there bug in my thinking?
(I did not investigate code too closely.)
