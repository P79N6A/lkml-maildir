I take this back .. The comment at the top of handle_simple_irq() is,
 *      Note: The caller is expected to handle the ack, clear, mask and
 *      unmask issues if necessary.
So we shouldn't need any flow control unless there is some other
factors.. 
Additionally, we have a patch in the real time tree called
"irq-mask-fix.patch" which adds an "unmask" to handle_simple_irq, but as
the note says we don't need flow control..
