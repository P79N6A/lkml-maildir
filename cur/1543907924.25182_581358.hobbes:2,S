Well, the point is that if you add new ones then alignment may be an
issue.  Putting them at the end (with a comment explaining why they're
there) will make it more robust.  Though splitting them into their own
sub-structure would probably be better.
Hm.  So x86-64 doesn't make 64-bit pointers be 64-bit aligned?
