I am not sure this is just a question of small variations.  The hdparm
-t differences between these two versions is quite significant.  This
evidence would imply that the two approaches are making fundemental
different decisions about what my hardware can do!
Under 2.2.17
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 21.86 seconds =  2.93 MB/sec
/dev/hdc:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 20.81 seconds =  3.08 MB/sec
Under 2.4.0
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  6.58 seconds =  9.73 MB/sec
/dev/hdc:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  6.59 seconds =  9.71 MB/sec
