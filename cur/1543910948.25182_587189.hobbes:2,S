10 patches for s390. The new vmur driver still has some rough edges
but we are getting there. Patch #10 is our solution to the atomic_t
vs. volatile problem. As prediced by Linus adding a barrier to
atomic_read/atomic_set has close to zero impact to the generated
code and adding the barrier to atomic_read/atomic_set forces the
compiler to read/write the value to/from memory. This seems to be
the most convenient way to solve this problem.
