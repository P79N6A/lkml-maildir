Ah - okay - that makes sense.  Those patches haven't gone through my
review yet and I'm not directly tracking their status until I figure
out what the right direction is with respect to a fair share style
scheduler of some sort.  I'm not convinced that the current one is
something that is ready for mainline or is necessarily the right answer
currently.  But we do need to figure out something that will provide
some level of CPU allocation minima & maxima for a class, where that
solution will work well on a laptop or a huge server.
Ideas in that space are welcome - I know of several proposed ideas
in progress - the scheduler in SuSE and the forward port to 2.6.10
that you referred to; an idea for building a very simple interface
on top of sched_domains for SMP systems (no fairness within a
single CPU) and a proposal for timeslice manipulation that might
provide some fairness that the Fujitsu folks are thinking about.
There are probably others and honestly, I don't have any clue yet as
to what the right long term/mainline direction should be here as yet.
