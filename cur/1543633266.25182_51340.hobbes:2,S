I've set up kernel remote debugging for 2.4.18 not so far ago. The
procedure is the same as for the 2.2.* series. You should simply use the
patch for the kernel version you use.

On my development machine I've set up one kernel with the kgdb internal
debugger, one kernel with the gdb-patch and one unpatched kernel with
the usual debugging stuff enabled ( all kernels of the same version - of
course ). Which kernel to run depends on the kind of problem to solve,
and is IMHO more a question of personal taste.
