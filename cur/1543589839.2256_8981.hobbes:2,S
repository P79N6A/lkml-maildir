Maybe, but the IWILL board is the only one we've heard about problems with.
The Abit KT7A (which also has the KT133A chipset and is otherwise identical
to the KT7) would appear to run smoothly, although I don't actually *have*
one of those.  Probably the Windows drivers turn off some feature of the
IWILL board which is known to be flaky.
I suggest setting *everything* in the BIOS to the "most conservative"
settings and seeing if the problem persists.  If so, then it can't be a
hardware-speed-limitation problem, and there's clearly something we have to
turn off "manually".  Also, try running memtest86 and see if that is
capable of triggering the problem.
