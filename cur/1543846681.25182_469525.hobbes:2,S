I am using emon.  Measuring a 20 second stretch of tbench run saw the L2
cache miss go from 14 million to 25 million on each of the cpu core.

The point is valid, __warn_once should be in cache, unless something
evicts it. What I have found so far is with patch by Andrew and Leonid
that avoid looking up the __warn_once integer, the cache miss rate is
reduced to the level before.

Unfortunately emon does not directly give the callsite.  Oprofile data
shows a marked increase in time spent in do_softirq and local_bh_enable.
What I could do is to individually turn off WARN_ON_ONCE at these sites
and see if they are responsible for the cache miss.  Will let you know
what I found.
