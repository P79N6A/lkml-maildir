I am seeing this as well.  I got around it by setting speed=2.  If you 
are using one of the newer R/W CD/DVD drives (which are slower than 
crap, BTW on Linux), you should set the speed manually and try 
progressively slower settings until you find one that works.
i.e. 
cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=1,0,0 file.iso
