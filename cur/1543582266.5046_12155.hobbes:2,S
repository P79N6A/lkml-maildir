Well, I run glibc-2.2.1 as well, so that might be one of the factors
contributing to this. Then again, glibc-2.2.1 with ext2 does not cause any
problems whatsoever with mozilla. So it could be that reiserfs + glibc-2.2.1 is
a bad combination, question remains which of these two is the culprit (if not
both). Since glibc-2.2.2 is out, I will give that a try as well. Not tonight
though...
And no, I'm not running RedHat 7.x for those who might think so (and
automatically blame everything on it).
When did you switch to glibc-2.2.1? Were you running reiserfs before that?
