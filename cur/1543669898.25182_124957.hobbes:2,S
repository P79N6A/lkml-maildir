I think this is a bit of a religious argument.  I know it's easy to
add syscalls, it's the question of adding a lot of goop.  I'm looking
for a situation for BProc that's similar to Tux's situation:
It's a project which exists outside main kernel development.  It's
foot print in the main line kernel is as small as possible - it's got
a single system call.  That system call *IS* a good size mux which
does a number of semi-related things.  Given the non-mainstream nature
of that feature, I think this is an entirely reasonable state of
affairs.
When it comes down to it, a system call mux is really no different
than an ioctl mux, the only question is whether or not you have a file
descriptor in the loop.
I don't believe that this leads to messy APIs.  I'm not saying that
BProc's API isn't messy - it is.  Some of it is ok.  Having the mux
allows the messy parts to exist until they are cleaned up.  I do want
to clean them up but that's not a trivial task.  I like some of the
file system ideas you've mentioned.

Yep.  It works great for kernel stuff.  Not so great for user space
stuff.

I really like the filesystem idea for the front end but...  Shared
filesystems are really a can of worms.  This would introduce a n^2
coherency problem that BProc has avoided so far.
Still, I like the idea for a file system interface on the master.  The
back end might be able to do something similar - but slowly.  The
wrinkle is that there's no information about nodes, etc. currently
stored in the kernel on any of the nodes.  That's all maintianed in
user space.

Sure... as soon as I get time to do a port.

That's really just shifting the responsibility to another hunk of
code.  Now, the dynamic linker (or any other piece of code that could
potentially mmap something like that) would need to know to tag the
region.  I'm sure there's a cleaner way to handle this than dealing in
lists of strings but involving the dynamic linker (another moving
target) doesn't seem like the right answer to me.
