But not without the pseudo-random number generation... ?

But its distribution might auto-correlate with the Jenkins function.
The only way to be sure is to remove the pseudo-random number generator.
Just try incrementing from, say, 10.0.0.0:10000 up, resetting port number
to 10000 at 16000, and just incrementing the IP address when the port
number wraps, instead of pseudo-random, through 2^30 loops for both.
If the same artifacts emerge, I give in.
Can you show the same artifacts for jenkins_3word?
