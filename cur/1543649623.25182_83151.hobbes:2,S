Massive?  Of course not.  Easy target for root kits, sure, but only if 
they've already been owned, first.  Under normal circumstances (there 
have been bugs in the past; iirc in kerneld for instance which let a user 
trick the system into loading an arbitrary file as a module) one can't 
load modules until one's already root, so the system would have had to be 
compromised already.  Trojaning the kernel is the best place for a  
rootkit to live; why bother replacing individual tools (and hoping you  
got them all, and that there's no static-linked integrity checker  
somewhere) when you can just modify opendir(2), even read(2), etc to lie  
for you?   
4-5 years ago I would have (and did) recommend staying away from modular   
kernels for this reason.  But binary-patching a running non-modular  
kernel has been well explored and is well-known; it's really no harder to 
trojan a non-modular kernel than a modular one.  Assuming you have not 
taken steps to disallow raw io, /dev/kmem access, etc.  If you are 
willing/able to do that, then you can just insmod all necessary modules, 
and then another one which disables further module-loading, drop the 
necessary capabilities systemwide, etc.  So again, modular/nonmodular 
kernel doesn't matter much.
