As the person who wrote the initial version of the driver (not the
only one, other people wrote versions at the same time, but mine was
the one that was the basis for what Robert took over and what got
merged in mainline) I'd also be interrested in where this person got
his/her info from. I looked long and hard for docs and send lots of
emails to IBM and others requesting info (unsuccessfully), all I could
ever find was 
http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/marksmith/tpaps.html
 which is then what I used to write the initial driver from.

Maybe if the person behind these patches could do the following
1) Come out with his/her real name.
2) Provide detailed information about what sources of info these
patches are based on.
3) Provide names and contact info for people at IBM/Lenovo/the company
who made the gyroscope (can't remember who they are) etc etc, so that
we can contact them and verify these patches are based on stuff that's
OK.
then we could accept the patches...
