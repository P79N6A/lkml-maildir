Also keep in mind, which zlib you are talking about.  Matt's patch is
to lib/inflate.c, which is used exclusively for the bootloader which
is built-in to the kernel on some arches.  That one was always far
behind and scary to look at.
The real kernel zlib is in a somewhat better state, many people cared
about and worked on it.  It's not great either, but at least better.
And yes, drop-in replacement or even runtime choice would be nice here.
