If you execute a FORMAT_UNIT properly, the timeout is irrelevant.  Set the
IMMED bit so the command returns as soon as the drive begins processing it.
Send TEST_UNIT_READY to check the progress.  I'll have to consult the
spec, but I think support for Immed is required.
That's how my (now 8 year old) tool for formating scsi devices (zip, jaz,
hard disks, tapes, etc.) has always worked. [No, it is not published code.
If the script kiddies want to low-level your hard drive, they're gonna have
to learn how to do it themselves.]

PS: That even works under Solaris where one does not have the source code
    to change the command timeouts.
