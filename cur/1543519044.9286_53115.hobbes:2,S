Are you sure it's 100% reliable over the time, monotone and with a
picosecond precision and that such way can be extended to SMP?

It's not a matter of recently in the past, but it must be _monotone_. If
you only lose coherency between tv_sec and tv_usec you can just have a TOD
that goes back instead of forward or equal sometime.

	read generation (= 1)
	rmb()
	read rdtsc-ref
	read xtime-ref
	rmb()
	read generation (= 1)
ok now you are happy and you trust the rdtsc-ref and xtime-ref to be
coherent.
But look what was going on in the other CPU0.
	CPU0			CPU1
	------------------	---------------------
	++generation (= 1)
	mb()
	write rdtsc-ref
				read generation (= 1)
				rmb()
				read rdtsc-ref
				read xtime-ref
				rmb()
				read generation (= 1)
				you are happy but you read a not coherent 
				value
	++generation (= 2)
	mb()
	write xtime-ref
Maybe there's a trival way to implement the lock-less critical section and
I am missing it...
