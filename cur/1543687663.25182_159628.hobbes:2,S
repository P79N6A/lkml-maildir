I agree.

Well, I think that 2.2.24 and 2.2.25 kernels are really stable (at least on
UP), but that the most weak side is on IDE disk drivers.
They seem to have DMA problems when using recent hard disks (i.e. Maxtor,
etc.)
that lead to serious file system corruption problems.
Maybe there are also geometry problems because all troubles have been
observed
on disks with more than 32 GB of capacity (i.e. 40 GB).
This is a pity because, up to now, 2.2.x kernels have been
a valid choice for small / semi-embedded systems 80x86
(yes, I know that 2.4 should be better, but I'm still waiting for
 a stable rock kernel).
In conclusion, I hope that next maintainer will think about
these matters:
	IDE drivers;
	security fixes;
	micro-optimizations;
	compatibility with newer compilers.
After all if 2.0 seems to be still alive also 2.2 should be.
