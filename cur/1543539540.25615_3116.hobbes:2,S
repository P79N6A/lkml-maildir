	Care to give a little better explanation?  What do you mean by

	This is *exactly* why you're having problems.  Threatening people is
*not* going to help.  You're using FUD tactics to try and get your way and
it should not *ever* work.  It's immoral and wrong.  You want people to
consider your patch?  Show it's merits, don't threaten them that you'll
try and destroy them if you don't get your way.
