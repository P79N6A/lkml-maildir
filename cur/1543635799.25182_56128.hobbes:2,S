For most cards that is all that has to be turned from a "happens to
work" into a "officially this is what happens". I've replied about how
to handle other stuff in an earlier message. Its not a big thing, and
getting rid of most of pci_find_device will help. We still have people
needing to find other devices so there are refcount/locking things to
handle akin to what was done to make the old networking dev_get() type
stuff actually DTRT
