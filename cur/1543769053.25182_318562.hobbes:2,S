Simply ensure that tulip_select_media() is always called from a process 
context. Then can you delay all you want.  Several of the calls are 
already this way, so that leaves two cases:
1) called from timer context, from the media poll timer
2) called from spin_lock_irqsave() context, in the ->tx_timeout hook.
The first case can be fixed by moved all the timer code to a workqueue. 
  Then when the existing timer fires, kick the workqueue.
The second case can be fixed by kicking the workqueue upon tx_timeout 
(which is the reason why I did not suggest queue_delayed_work() use).
See, it's not rocket science :)
