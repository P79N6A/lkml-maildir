The changes to check scsi_init_malloc() returned value are
in both 2.2.12 and 2.3.16 . My guess is that they were
probably in 2.2.11 as well. So it probably isn't an
Advansys driver problem.
On the subject of Advansys, Bob Frey is currently in the
final testing phase of an upgrade to that driver which will 
handle the ABP3940U2W adapter (and fix problems reported
over the last year).
