Great! Seems to work now:

inserting floppy driver for 2.6.8.1-mm4
floppy: controller ACPI FDC0 at I/O 0x3f0-0x3f5, 0x3f7 irq 6 dma
channel 2
floppy: FDC0 _CRS erroneously includes 0x3f0
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077

I'm not sure if that warning is really necessary or not, but for debug
purposes it is not a problem.  As such, might want to consider change
that message to a KERNEL_DEBUG.  Not really a big issue though I
guess.  I just don't like the word "erroneously" in my kernel logs
each time I boot :)

I have to remove the acpi_strict code that you added in order to get
the driver to load.  I am using it as a module, and the acpi_strict
symbol does not seem to be exported by the kernel.  Since I am not
using the acpi=strict flag anyways, I just killed the related 6 lines
from your patch before applying it.  I'm sure it would have been fine
had I compiled the driver into the kernel, but as it stands now the
acpi_strict variable would need to be exported I guess.
