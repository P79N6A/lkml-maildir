If you cannot wait for Arjan or anybody else to write an ataraid setup
tool, you can go with dmsetup and choose any name you want (see the
dmsetup man page). The only restriction is that dmsetup creates device
under /dev/mapper, you can though use symlinks to it like LVM2 does if
you need it under /dev/ataraid or something (in your initscript). If you
don't have a better idea you can just give it the same name as before.
