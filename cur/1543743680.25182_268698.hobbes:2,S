on my x86-64, there doesn't seem to be an irq for snd-intel8x0.

ps ax doesn't seem to show anything sound-related except jackd so I
tried chrt -f  75 jackd -R -d alsa -P -HMm -z s -o 6
result during an emerge metadata on V0.7.13:
**** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 133.973 msecs
**** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 78.544 msecs
**** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 245.494 msecs
*much* better but we're shooting for 0 xruns, no?
