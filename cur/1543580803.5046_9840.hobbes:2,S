Yes. But since Red Hat took upon themselves to define "gcc 2.96", they
should have created a new patchlevel (2.96.1) for their fixed compiler.
As it stands, there is no way to determine programatically whether
gcc-2.96 is broken or now. The only way to do it is to check the RPM
version -- which, needless to say, is a bit difficult to do from the
C code about to be compiled. So I can't really blame Hans if he decides
to outlaw gcc-2.96[.0] for reiserfs compiles.
