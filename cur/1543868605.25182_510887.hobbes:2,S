I meant "it's to be checked", if it's used by a program.
The name: work_release seems to tell the work function
could signal, when it doesn't need a structure no more.
But br_if.c doesn't seem to use this infomation now,
so there should be no difference after changing to
"without _NAR". This change will limit some potential
changes in the future, but if it's not used by anybody
than the simpler api is a gain.
