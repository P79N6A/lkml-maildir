That's why I was asking for a better place to put this printk, maybe the 
correct one is just _before_ the module register its "features", you can 
always check `dmesg` for a list of loaded modules, but again, if I put the 
printk before the module correctly registers I can get some fake "loaded" 
messages, from modules that did not complete the registration. I'll review 
more carefully the loading process, perhaps adding the module address, or 
even its path, I'll give it a look after giving class today, I'm already 
late 8-)
Best regards.
