You might want to have a look at
	
http://www.psc.edu/networking/perf_tune.html
It's a pretty good reference on TCP tuning.
Also, one gotcha: in earlier versions of 2.4 the window scaling factor was
set using the DEFAULT window size instead of the MAXIMUM window size; that
is, window scaling is set such that neither autotuning nor application level
tuning can actually tune to the maximum size (it can't be represented with
the default window scale factor). I don't think this has been fixed yet,
so you may have to set your default to be the same as your maximum for tests.
