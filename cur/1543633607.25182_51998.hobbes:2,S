I sit corrected.  Synapse must have misfired.  The only references
I see to incomplete typedefs in our code or in the ANSI spec are
related to:
typedef struct foo foo_t;
No, we didn't use gcc for our kernel but it was an ANSI compiler.
My test didn't use -Wall for gcc, duh...
I was thinking that incomplete typedefs would be okay as long as you
only used them in prototypes, but only struct */union * pointers
are guaranteed to be compatible, not int */struct * pointer, so
this couldn't have been of any use.
I'll be sure to consume one extra beer this weekend to kill off that
bad synapse.
