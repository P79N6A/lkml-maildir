hi guys, and congratulations on another great release (2.4.18) :-)
I have been patiently waiting for support for the i810_audio to be improved, 
it currently works, and it has flawless stability, but the sound quality it 
produces it dreadful. I realise this is no life and death problem, and i 
would imagine a low priority request, but i would really appreciate some 
info on if it is still being maintained / developed.
I am currently running 2.4.18 , but have recently downloaded and tried the 
2.5.5 release, just as a taster, to see if the ALSA integration had fixed my 
problem, no such luck :-(
I have also been watching the changelogs and have downloaded any 
kernel/patch release that even mentions the i810 :-) ( I dont run a 
development kernel, but I have tried them just as a taster :-) )
I dont know very much about the workings of sound cards, but the problem is 
that when playing anything a total crackling in the background that makes 
the audio almost unusable...a real pity.
From reading the comments at the top of the i810_audio.c code, I think the 
authors have had some difficulty, i guess the hardware is awkward to write 
for or something :-)
I was so looking forward to the 2.5.5 ALSA release, but as it didnt fix my 
problem, does anyone know if there are plans to? or am i better off 
abandoning all hope and getting a new card?
Thanks for any help guys! and keep up the excellent, excellent work your all 
doing!
