It was vanilla 2.4.10. No other patches. Just ext2. Reiserfs is compiled
in modules but it is not used (no modules loaded) 3 partitions.
The machine runs Celeron 366 (so no Athlon optimisations), one IDE drive
and 3c59x eth card. Rivafb compiled in.
Today I have applied ext3 patch and it runs with no problems till now.
