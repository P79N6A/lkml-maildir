It should be noted that implimenting full journaling in a normal FS is a
waste unless you extend the transaction APIs to the applictaion layer and
get apps to use them. 
It does little good to have singlar files consistant while the whole file
tree is potentially self-contradictory.
I expect, given Hans' ambitions will offer this sometime in the future.
