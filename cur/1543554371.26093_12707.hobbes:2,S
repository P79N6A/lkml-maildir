Keep in mind that on some operating systems, sometimes processes
become STUCK in "short disk wait". That may mean that if you just
discard those processes (they won't do any useful work until you
reboot the system), you will see the load average one point higher
than what should be expected. 
This is almost always a bug somewhere. 
So, if you're not actually loading the machine with 12 processes doing
disk IO, and still seeing a load of 12, chances are that there are
processes stuck in the (D) state. That's a bug. Report the bug.
