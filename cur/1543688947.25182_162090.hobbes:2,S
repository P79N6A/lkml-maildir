Hi,
Just wondering if maybe DMA mode isn't on when you get this "~1.5MB/s" speeds, 
regardless of the driver version (maybe one doesn't set it automatically) (?)
Do you use hdparm to get these speeds? Check if DMA is on by using hdparm -i 
/dev/hd? (change to your device of course) , if it's not try e.g. hdparm -d1 
-X66 /dev/hd? (X66=ultra DMA 2 if your device supports that or even try 
multiword, example X34=multiword DMA 2)
