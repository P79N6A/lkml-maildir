Send Illegal Vector and Receive Illegal Vector at the same time.
This is more interesting than the usual 40(40) errors
(just Receive Illegal Vector), since 60 implies that the
CPU itself is the source of the bogus vector, whereas 40
usually implies a crap mainboard.
My guess is that either your hardware (whatever it is,
you didn't leave any clues) has problems with a noisy
APIC bus, broken chipset, or something like that, or
you enabled ACPI and the ACPI tables are crap.
In any event, Linux is probably not the source of the
problem. You may need to run without I/O APIC ("noapic"
kernel param), no ACPI-based PCI routing ("pci=noapci"),
or completely without ACPI ("acpi=off").
