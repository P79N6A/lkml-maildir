I can understand that an implementation of NFS+xattr could
present some issues where only one side speaks the xattr
protocols, or where they speak them differently. If that's
a showstopper from the network protocol side (it isn't from
the file system end, client or server) then you're right,
it won't work. What I don't understand is why it would be
a showstopper. The current NFS protocol makes all sorts of
assumptions about the data it passes (like the uids on the
two ends mapping sanely) that seem to me to be as much a
problem as xattr value mapping.

I think that I understand that you believe that, what I
don't understand is why you believe that. Is it an artifact
of the locking protocol that only worked about half the
time, and then in a half donkied way?
I'm not trying to be an obstructionist idiot here, even if
that's how it may appear. I have my pet solution, I really
don't see the problem with it, and it looks to me like the
arguements against it are either so obvious I'm missing them
(does happen) or based on dogmas I don't subscribe to.
Thank you for helping me (and maybe some others) understand
the issues we're up against so that I (we) can address issues
better in the future.
