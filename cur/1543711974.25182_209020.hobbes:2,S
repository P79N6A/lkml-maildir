Please give me a little more credit than that. This is largely over,
but when assessing it, do note:
#if defined(CONFIG_HIGHPTE) && defined(CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G)
typedef u32 pte_addr_t;
#endif
#if defined(CONFIG_HIGHPTE) && defined(CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G)
typedef u64 pte_addr_t;
#endif
#if !defined(CONFIG_HIGHPTE)
typedef pte_t *pte_addr_t;
#endif
Yes, I also realized that in principle, one could have only used
PG_direct if the pagetable fell into the lower 32GB or stuffed the 33rd
bit into PG_arch and so on and so forth wrt. the 33rd bit.
