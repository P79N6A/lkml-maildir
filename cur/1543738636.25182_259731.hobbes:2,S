>What if kernel image is hosed instead?
Well, there's only so far we can go. If the alternator on a car is bad, we can 
run on the battery for a little bit to get to the auto parts store. If the 
engine is cracked, we're going to need an engine hoist and a good mechanic. :-)

The hosing I am imagining is one done by the fat fingers of the sys-admin, not 
so much because of disk corruption.
