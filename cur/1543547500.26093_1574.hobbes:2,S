This again confirms that any mention of the word "enterprise" in press
releases and the like really means just "we're only accustomed to the
Windows programming model, so from _our_ perspective everything else
looks inferior".

In part because a sizable portion of development resources in those
projects was spent deciphering the undocumented protocols rather than
implementing/optimizing them?
Try any NT-based SMTP/IMAP mail server, for a large enterprise, in
contrast. Compare it with any Un*x solution. The specs have been
public down to the last bit for 20 years (and we should assume that M$
engineers are at least capable of reading).
