Ok, I think I have a hint.
The drive that is failling is the secondary slave [1].
When I try to change xfermode with hdparm -X, it take some times (10 s) 
and I found an error in the kernel log.
But even with that error, it seem the xfermode is changed.
What happen with libata if we lose an interrupt ?
