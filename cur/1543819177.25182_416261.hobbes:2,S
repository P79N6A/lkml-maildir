Heh, this part is *EXACTLY* a fully sufficient explanation of what I was
wondering about myself just these days ;)
(I'm experimenting with different timeslice values on my P3/450 to verify
what performance impact exactly it has)
However with a measly 256kB cache it probably doesn't matter too much,
I think.
But I think it's still important to mention that your perception might be
twisted by your P4 limitation (no testing with slower and really slow
machines).
