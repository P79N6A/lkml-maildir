Yes, I see your point. I guess I made an incorrect assumption about it
being changed between reboots. It could be related to routing or something
instead. I'll have to dig a bit further to find a pattern. 
However, even if I *do* find the pattern, I still think it is reasonable
to turn off PMTU discovery for ICMP explicitly, instead of based on the
setting of ipv4_config:
1) The setting for the one global ICMP socket gets set once and for all
at initialization time and doesn't track the setting of ip_no_pmtu_disc.
2) Even if it *did* track ip_no_pmtu_disc, the missing per-protocol
granularity of ip_no_pmtu_disc means that you couldn't have PMTU discovery
enabled for TCP, while having it disabled for ICMP.
3) I don't see any reason for wanting to do automatic PMTU discovery for
ICMP packets; normally they are only sent once, and you'll risk it being
dropped somewhere along its path if the DF bit is set.
