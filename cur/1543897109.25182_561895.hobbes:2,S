I won't be around until a day or two before KS, so I'd prefer to have it
after KS if possible.

As more of a filesystem person I wouldn't mind it being attached to a VM
conf.  In the worst case we'll just rename it VM/FS conference.  When and
where is it scheduled?

Don't forget high order pagecache please.

More issues:
 - aio once again
 - refactoring the dio code to separate locking down user VM and doing
   the actual page based I/O.  I've seen valid requests from kernel
   initiated direct I/O from a few real world linux users.
 - generic code for delayed allocation and writeout using efficient
   multi-page allocator calls.  I'll hopefully have an example (lifted XFS
   code) by then
 - what to do about reads/writes from kernelspace.  Currently we have
   some places (loop mostly) calling directly into ->prepare_write / 
   ->commit_write which is completely wrong from the layerin perspective
   and a locking nightmare for distributed or generally more complex
   filesystems.  And we have a lot of places using set_fs/set_ds and
   calling into ->write.  The first category could probably be covered
   by using the splice infrastructure, but for the latter we'd want
   something more optimal and less hacky, especially given all the overhead
   related avoiding deadlocks involing the user address space in the
   generic write path.  Maybe it's time for generic_file_kernel_write?
