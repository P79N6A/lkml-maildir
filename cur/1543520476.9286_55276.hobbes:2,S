Hello!
   Today I came to my server and saw:
wait_on_irq, CPU1:
irq: 0 [0 0]
bh: 1 [1 0]
[<c010b5dd>] [<c01a4005>] [<c01ac015>] [<c01abf3f>] [<c01ae293>] [<c01ae5f8>] [<c01ab7e7>]
All over screen. Server was dead, except sysrq-b works.
I decoded above code trace:
Trace: c010b5dd <__global_cli+b9/130>
Trace: c01a4005 <rs_write+141/1f4>
Trace: c01ac015 <ppp_tty_push+c5/180>
Trace: c01abf3f <ppp_async_send+67/78>
Trace: c01ae293 <ppp_send_frame+267/29c>
Trace: c01ae5f8 <ppp_send_ctrl+e0/11c>
Trace: c01ab7e7 <ppp_tty_write+103/110>
Kernel at that time was 2.2.14pre9. Box is SMP Dual Pentium III.
Last line in logs says that user from dialin ppp line asked for pop3 service.
This is second similar hang, but with first one I have not managed to get the
trace, as I forgot to disable screen blanker.
Is that fixed in 2.2.14pre16?
Bye,
    Oleg
