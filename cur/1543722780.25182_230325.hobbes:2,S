Not sure.  NFSv3 appears to be fixable, the only context is the UID,
which happens to be stored in the inode as well.  NFSv4 and cifs could
be worse, I didn't look closely yet.  smbfs accesses the dentry, which
has similar effects, but should be fixable as well.
Do you know of any impossible cases?
