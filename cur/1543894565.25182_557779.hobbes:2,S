Surely it's more:
   bad == go away and don't use future improvements to our software anymore please.
??
*If* you think it's bad (Linus doesn't as far as the kernel goes) then isn't it 
reasonable to exclude 'bad for the community' from the community?
This isn't retroactive - they can continue to use any V2 software they had, they 
wouldn't be able to use V3 developments.
That seems to me to be a very, very reasonable thing to do (and very much *not* 
bad == illegal IMHO)

PS well, I was just seeing if anyone had fixed my libata/md bug yet but this 
seemed more interesting.
PPS and Tejun has, I'm off...
