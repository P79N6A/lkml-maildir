  If don't use acpi_early_init , acpi is initialized in do_basic_setup() in kernel thread --init.
It is very close to launch first user space process(/sbin/init ..). So, if we can invent 
acpi_later_init, it is possible to move interpreter out of kernel.
  The difficulty for inventing userspace interpreter is to eliminate the ACPI-interpreter dependency 
of drivers for booting. But this dependency is not mandatory. Once kernel booted to be able
to launch /sbin/init, it is also able to launch /sbin/user_space_interpreter, then kernel can enjoy
acpi from then on, despite the acpi interpreter is a user space daemon, we just need to invent
or user a communication method between kernel and user space daemon.
  But, Not sure what's the evil consequence from this approach. Say, if kernel need service
from ACPI interpreter, ACPI interpreter should be get scheduled.  Is it racy?
Thanks
Luming
