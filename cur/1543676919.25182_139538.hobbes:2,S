Hello,
I think the main benfit of cachefs is on NFS servers. Cachefs of
clients can help them to reduce their loads. We know many clients
may share one huge NFS server.
(e.g. Streaming systems which contents may be extremly huge.)

Cachefs is different from union mount as it is required to synchronize
contents in it with contents on NFS servers. 
I guess it isn't easy to keep them as any other clients may modify the
contents of the servers at any time.

And we should use filesystem as cache space so that we can make
cachefs be persistent cache. After rebooting all cache remains valid.
Thank you,
