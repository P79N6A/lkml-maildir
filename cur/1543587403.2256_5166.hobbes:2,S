Following up - it just bit again (twice)
The first time, it was xmms/kswapd fighting for CPU, and xmms was again immune
to kill -9.  Interestingly enough, several minutes later, I closed 'netscape',
and xmms took the kill within a second or two.
10 minutes later, and another 2 programs that do audio got
wedged up. Oddly enough, I did an 'su', and they broke loose immediately.
I've ruled out i810_audio.c as a culprit - although I have programs that
do audio hanging, *those* programs are always writing their data down
a Unix socket to the actual process that writes to /dev/audio/dsp.
Hmm.. 'su' writes to syslog, and netscape has a few Unix sockets too.
Could the problem be related to running out of some resource related
to Unix-domain sockets, which clears up once some socket is closed?
Oddly enough, while I had 2 programs doing audio wedged, I was still
seeing (hearing actually ;) *new* processes open a connection to esd
and play sounds.  Weird.
