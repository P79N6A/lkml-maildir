I think this would be valuable .. the other thing that really needs to
be present is a "common vendor" kernel where changes that are common
to most distros are merged (eg O(1) scheduler, etc). Personally, I think 
that's what mainline should be doing ... but if other people disagree,
then I, at least, would see value in a separate tree to do this.
