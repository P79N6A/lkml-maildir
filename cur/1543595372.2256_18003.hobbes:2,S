This is only true without the COMPAT_DIR_INDEX flag.  Since e2fsck _needs_
to know about every filesystem feature, it will (correctly) refuse to touch
such a system for now.  You could "tune2fs -O ^FEATURE_C4 /dev/hdX" to
turn of the COMPAT_DIR_INDEX flag and let e2fsck go to town.  That will
break all of the directory indexes, I believe.
Cheers, Andreas
