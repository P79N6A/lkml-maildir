This does not in any way prevent them from releasing a driver,
open or closed source.  It merely makes tampering with
the driver illegal.
And it doesn't prevent them from merely releasing programming specs
if they're too cheap to make a driver either.  Of course whoever
programs the driver will then have to get approved
by the bureaucracy himself, or leave it to some linux vendor
before it can be (legally) used.
No driver _and_ no specs means they aren't supporting linux
at the moment.
