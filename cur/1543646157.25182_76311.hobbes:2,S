I'd seen a similar problem under 2.4.19 with your NFS-ALL patch
applied.  The client would lock up for periods of up to several minutes
at a time without generating any traffic, then would wake up and
retransmit.  This would continue for a few seconds (rarely more than 30
seconds of uninterrupted IO) before another huge pause-and-retransmit
cycle began.
Your patch restores client performance to sane levels.  It applies
cleanly against 2.4.19 with NFS-ALL.  I suggest you republish NFS-ALL
with this patch applied, in case other people who are stuck with 2.4.19
run into this problem.
Thanks,
