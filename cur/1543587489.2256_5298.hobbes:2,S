Hi Dawson,
Excellent project.
Can I suggest that you check for signedness issues? A typical signature of
a signedness problem is:
int i = get_from_userspace_somehow();
/* Sanity check i */
if (i > MAX_LEN_FOR_I)
  goto bad_bad_out;
/* Bug here!! i can be negative! */
I suspect you find a lot of these sort of errors. I've already nailed a
few.
Cheers
Chris
