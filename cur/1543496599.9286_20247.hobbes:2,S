Subject: kernel 2.3.3 color skew with Atifb

I'm using an Ati Mach 64 and I seem to be seeing some color skew when I
change in and out of Xwin (dfdev Xserver in 32bit color mode). 
The colors look fine but if I change VTs and back what used to be black
becomes bright red and yellow. 
Anyone have any idea why this is? I didn't have this trouble back in
2.2.7.
