even for dynamically linking including non-GPL code is not white but 
already dark grey.

There are no "persons responsible for defending the kernel GPL", there 
are just a few hundreds or thousands copyright holders of the kernel,
and each of them has the right to sue you if he thinks you distribute 
something that violates his copyright. Jurisdiction and applicable 
copyright law depends on things like where the copyright holder lives 
and where you distribute it.
