thanks, but what is the exact problem source , DMA or unmask IRQ ?

Doh !  really bad news :-(  
What about watching DVDs ?
I'm watching DVDs on windoze using a software-only player,
and without DMA you get nast frameskips ,because the PIO
transfer uses too much CPU.
I'm watching DVDs for hours ( DMA enabled) without any lockups.
But are you sure that every ATAPI CDROM drive on the planet
has this hardware flaw.
I stressed my CDROM drives quite a bit, and was unable to lock up the box.

Interesting, any pointers for more accurate infos on this topics ?
How is this handled my other OSes ?

PS: why should recent ATAPI CDROM let you set the DMA mode, when they
know that it could lead to problems ?
