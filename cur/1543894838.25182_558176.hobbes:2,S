Spinlocks aren't fair, so this kind of problem is always a possibility.
I think maybe we need another kind of unlock that gives another processor
a fair chance at the lock. Some things you could try to see if they help:
- add smp_mb() after the unlock
- replace cpu_relax() with usleep()
- use an xchcg instruction to do the unlock, like i386 does when
  CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE is set
-
