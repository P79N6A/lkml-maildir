You know that spinning disks do some recalibrations?
Whatever marketing tries to imply with "realtime volumes" - the
technology only tries to make better promises (think of AV disks
for better sustained rate).
LynxOS (now LynuxWorks) has some patents for priority based IO.
And yes, I know about "resource kernels" and alike.
But that does not count for spinning disks: they are *not* predictable.
And think about the shared bus like PCI - out of *hard realtime* when
not talking about worst cases in ranges of seconds.
