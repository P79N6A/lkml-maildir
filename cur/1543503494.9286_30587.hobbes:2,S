Are you talking about the patch to fs/nfs/inode.c that was posted to
nfs-devel? Please don't take offence, but that patch seems completely
wrong to me.
The nfs_proc_lookup in function _nfs_revalidate_inode is only there
for debugging purposes (it looks up any existing new file handle in
order to provide a nice resume in the kernel error log of the ESTALE
error). The fact that it returns NFS_OK doesn't mean a thing since we
don't use the looked up information to update the stale file handle
(and we don't want to since that could mean that asynchronous writes
end up overwriting the new file instead of failing).
The correct place IMHO for solving this problem is in the revalidation
of the cached dentries themselves (not the inode!), which means
nfs_lookup_revalidate and/or nfs_lookup. This ensures that the problem
is solved upon reopen of the file/directory which is what users would
normally expect.
Cheers,
   Trond
