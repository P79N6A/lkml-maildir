Damn binary thing.
It's the same core code as the Windows Detonator 3 driver. Hence the mention.
The next one will be based on the Detonator 4 core code, so things like 
OpenGL 1.3 (which is supposedly available with the Detonator 4 drivers 
under Windows) will be available.
Paul, you may want to see my post earlier re 2.4.14 vanilla and my 
experiences so far, which have all been good.
