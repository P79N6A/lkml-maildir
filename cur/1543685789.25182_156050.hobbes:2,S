I would prefere to have it as a sub range "min real RT" <SOFT_RR range < mean 
real RT. Using SOFTRR time slice that is inverse proportional with the level 
might also be beneficial.

Why shouldn't it be useful with video, is a frame processing burst longer than 
a time slice? The rule for when to and how to revert a SCHED_SOFTRR can be 
changed.
*	SCHED_FIFO requests from non root should also be treated as SCHED_SOFTRR
