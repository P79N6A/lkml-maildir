Sorry for the delay.  I've been catching up on other things before
I dived back in.

There are cases where there are multiple child_reapers.
So is_init() is not the right test there.
There is a really weird case when you have a threaded init and the primary
thread exits where things get weird.  As I recall there wind up being two
tasks with tgid == 1 and pid == 1.  So simply testing the pid is not
sufficient.

Whatever works.  I'm not too particular as long as the important bits happen.
However pid == 0 only ever lives in the root pspace and never shows up in
the pid hash tables so we can get away without a special check.
