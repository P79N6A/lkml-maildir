Hmmm... What about extracting all format strings from the KMSG_DOC
macros and storing them in a file. E.g.:
  printk("lp%d: on fire");
  /**
   * message
   *
   * Description:
   * Your printer failed basic tests, you should check cabling
   ...
  KMSG_DOC(lp, "lp%d: on fire");
Some build mechanism creates a file with all format strings of the
KMSG_DOC macros:
E.g.: cat kmsgs.txt
# MSG:       "lp%d: on fire"
# COMPONENT: lp
# DESC:      Your printer failed basic tests, you should check cabling
Then we provide a tool e.g. "kmsg", which gets as input the actual
kernel message and searches the message database for matching format
strings:
>> kmsg "lp0: on fire"
>> Your printer ...
Of course, we can get duplicate hits, too.
The advantage of that approach is, that we don't need additional message
identifiers like hashes.
