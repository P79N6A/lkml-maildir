Still, for basic compile testing and testing patches on other
architectures it would be nice, when the patch writer can test his/her
patch with a simple defconfig, without knowing a common platform for
this target arch.
So please include a defconfig with a reasonable common set of CONFIG_*
options. It's about testing the core of the architecure not about
random driver failures.

arm is another one which uses this style, ia64 for example uses configs/*
and defconfig. But on arm and sh `make defconfig` works contrary to v850.
