err, why was that a macro?  It could have been implemented as an inline. 
One which doesn't evaluate its argument twice (or once if it was -1).

I've been going around telling people to not bother with the ifdefs here. 
Upside: looks nicer.  Downside: defers the build error from compile-time to
link-time.

open-coded knowledge of uid==0 might be problematic for containerisation. 
Maybe it's on the containers team's radar, maybe it's actually not a
problem, don't know.  (adds cc).
