Absolutely. I'm just theorizing that it is possible to devise a system 
that would be able to deal with such a situation, analogous to the way 
the kernel can deal with bugs in userspace processes (segfaults, traps, 
etc.).

If the system is designed such that all resources are tracked, then you 
could clean them up when the "hung" entity is killed (the way we do it 
for userspace resources).  In this case there is no more jammed code. 
The next guy to aquire the mutex knows the hardware is in an 
undetermined state, and is responsable for reinitializing it to a known 
state.  This would be horribly complicated, but I don't think it would 
be impossible.

I don't disagree with you on this.  I think that fixing the bad code is 
absolutely the way to go.  I'm  simply indulging in a thought experiment 
as to whether or not it is theoretically possible to create a system 
that would be able to clean up after this sort of thing once it has 
happened.
