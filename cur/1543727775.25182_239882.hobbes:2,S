I had to reboot late last night, out of memory and things (like 
mozilla (1.7.2) were dying, but nothing in the logs.  Nearly out 
again, now ~40megs free but so far its stable & nothing in swap.  I'm 
getting the impression there is a memory leak somewhere.  OOm hasn't 
killed anything I am using at this time anyway.
Its running like an arthritic dog though, 3 units for seti yesterday, 
s/b 6 to 7.  The gkrellm2 cpu usage display looks plumb normal, so 
I'm a bit puzzled as to why the slowdown, the rest of the system 
'feels good'.
This is with just the 'one liner' on top of rc3 & non-verbose-debug.  
The question is, is rc3-mm1 ready for *me* to try?
I don't want to be the hangup, holding up forward progress, but it 
appears I (& maybe 1 or 2 others) may be exactly that with all this 
time sitting around waiting for the other shoe to drop.
