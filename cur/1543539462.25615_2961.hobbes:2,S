OK, I'm pissed off enough. It's a bullshit argument for a very simple
reason: want me to send the pre-canned code that does right bit-banging to
the rootshell? Script-kiddies _can_ run prebuilt code and there's always
somebody writing it. Sooner or later. Security through obscurity does not
work. So all references to script-kiddies are at best clueless, at worst -
dishonest.

What makes you think that somebody cares what tools do you prefer to use?
If you want decisions based _not_ on technicalities and are willing to
deal with consequences of such attitude - Microsoft looks like an ideal
variant for you, use their products by all means.
PS: Andre, again, my apologies - looks like I've deleted the original
posting of our blackmailer-wannabe friend, thus the reply over the
head. Obioctl() - could somebody actually show which programs are using
it? If none - out it should go, those who want it can do the thing from
userland via /dev/port.
