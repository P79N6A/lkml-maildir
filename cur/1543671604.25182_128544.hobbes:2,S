One more question; do you mount other nfs-partitions after booting?
I should probably try to play a bit more around with nfsroot.  As for
now, I skipped it completely, and chose to rely on initrd instead.  I
get grub to download a (quite big) initrd from the server, and then
it's passed to the kernel as the root system.  After booting, I can
put up network and mount partitions through nfs.
