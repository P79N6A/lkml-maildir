For the filesystems with which I am familiar, this feature would
be quite difficult to implement.  Quite difficult indeed.  And given
that it only provides recovery for write errors, its value seems
questionable.
Much easier would be for those applications which really care about
data integrity to fsync() the file before closing it.  If either of those
calls returns an error, the *application* should take some form of
action to preserve the data.   MTAs do this, for example.
That being said, our propagation of I/O errors is a bit wobbly in places
(and the loop device hides write IO errors completely).  But that's a
separate issue.
On this one, I would be more interested in the opinion of sophisticated
*users* of linux rather than kernel developers, btw.  Whether this is
a valuable feature.

umm... Daniel's error was on a read.  The data is not, by definition,
in memory.   It's gone.
What percentage of disk errors occur on writes, as opposed to reads?
If errors-on-writes preponderate then maybe you're on to something.
But I don't think they do?
