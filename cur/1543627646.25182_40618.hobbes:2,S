I think you just want to change HZ, and can do that safely. Do note that
some software may be using 100 instead of HZ, so you might get some
problems there.
Think of HZ as "how often do we want to thrash the cache of CPU-bound
processes." More is not necessarily better.
If you want low latency there are low latency and preempt patches. They
will do more the make the system responsive than increasing HZ.
