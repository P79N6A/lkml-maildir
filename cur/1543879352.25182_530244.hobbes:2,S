I unpacked it, ran "strings" on it, and found no usbtouch in there.
There were plenty of other usb names, such as usbfs, usbserial, usbcore
and tons of messages that usb mass storage and usb serial might
need to produce.
Versions of some tools, I don't know if there are any
known issues:
$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)
$ ld --version
GNU ld (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.17.50.20070406
$ dpkg -l binutils
ii  binutils       2.17.20070406c The GNU assembler, linker and binary
