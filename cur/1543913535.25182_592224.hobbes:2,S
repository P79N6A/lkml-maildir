OK, good.

No. The existing mainline code is buggy, and it is just hoping that
the userspace page does not get paged out between the fault_in_pages
and the subsequent copy_from_user.
If you do multiple fault_in_pages_readable(), you probably have less
chance of deadlocking, but on the 2nd call, you might still have to
wait for a long time to page in, during which time the 1st page may get
paged out.
But there is a proper solution in -mm with the write_begin aop.
