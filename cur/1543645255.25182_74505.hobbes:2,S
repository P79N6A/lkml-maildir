A cute list_head debugging patch seems to have found strange list_entry
use in vmscan.c in stock 2.5.39.
page_mapping_inuse:
	if (!list_empty(&mapping->i_mmap) || !list_empty(&mapping->i_mmap_shared))
is being called for for a mapping in which:
 i_mmap = {next = 0x0, prev = 0x0}, i_mmap_shared = { next = 0x0, prev = 0x0}
this surely can't be intended.. list_empty will fail, but it isn't on
any lists.
I can reproduce this at will by cating a filesystem to /dev/null after
booting.  
too many details:

I am as about as ignorant about the VM as one can be.  I'm happy to
provide more info or act as a kgdb operator if this is actually
something that needs looking into..
