Ok. So let's use sector addressing by default and have a DOS-compatibility
mode which should be run-time compatible.  If the kernel detects the presence
of such a partition type he should print a warning and enter the compatibility
mode unless explicitly instructed otherwise (doscompat=0 or something like
that..)
But obviously that is something for 2.3...
