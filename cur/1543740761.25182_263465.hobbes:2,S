You don't have "SysKonnect FDDI PCI support" enabled in your .config?
That's what I wanted to say in my comment:
There's a name clash between two global `timer_event':
The one you introduced, and the one in drivers/net/skfp/queue.c .
I don't know whether `timer_event' is too generic for the use you 
introduced, but for the use in drivers/net/skfp/queue.c (which was 
already present) it seems too generic.
