Well, personally I like the 2.6.x.y idea.

Hm, now that I think about it, it has an advantage. eg. No problems
for other people with maintaining code for 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, ...
Anyway, starting with other trees like 2.7 sends a signal to people, that
something huge is going to happen. Like totally new ideas that require
to change the APIs, rewrite all the drivers (I know nobody likes that, really)
etc...
I was asking If something like this is about to happen.
Is a stockpile of things like this building up?
