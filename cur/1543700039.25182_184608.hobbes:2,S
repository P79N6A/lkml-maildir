Subject: [patch] qla1280 crash fix in error handling

Hi,
The following patch fixes a big in the qla1280 driver where it would
leave a pointer to an on the stack completion event in a command
structure if qla1280_mailbox_command fails. The result is that the
interrupt handler later tries to complete() garbage on the stack. The
mailbox command can fail if a device on the bus decides to lock up etc.
Patch relative to 2.6.0-test11 but should apply to the current BK tree
as well.
Cheers,
Jes
