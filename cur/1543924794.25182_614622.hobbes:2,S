You can use \? to represent "one character" and
\?\* to represent "at least one character".

"one byte" is almost equal to "one character".
"\?" matches to one of the following types.
*  1 ASCII printable character (for 0x21-0x2E or 0x30-0x5B or 0x5D-0x7E)
*  2 ASCII printable characters \\ (for 0x5C, which means single "\")
*  4 ASCII printable characters \ooo (for 0x01-0x20 or 0x7F-0xFF, where "ooo" is octal value)
These 3 types represents one *byte*.
I want to say "\? matches to one character",
but since expression of a character depends on the value of that byte,
I'm saying "\? matches to one *byte* character" instead.
Well, this sentence might be confusing, but how can I express more accurately?
Thanks.
