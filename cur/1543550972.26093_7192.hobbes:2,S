Now we're getting somewhere! :)
Inode number would have to store disk maj:min too, and have the ability to
flush inodes stored for a particular disk when mounted/umounted. This might
cause a problem for one-time writes to a /proc entry that aren't refreshed when
the fs is [re]mounted.
Also, if you upgrade 'named' and replace the old executable, that inode entry
in /proc no longer makes sense. It's almost too hard to maintain by storing
the inode, unfortunately.
I like the idea for adding a high MB mark at which to kill the process (only
when OOM is kicked in). That can be added in addition to a priority scheme.
I envision a /proc format such as this, one entry per line:
/full/path/to/executable [priority] [max kbytes used]
where Priority is -20 to +20 (default 0), -20 being kill at last resort and +20
being try to kill these processes first.
max kbytes, if present and nonzero, would match this process only if its total
VSZ is >= kb.
An example file could be:
/sbin/init -20
/usr/sbin/syslogd -19
/usr/sbin/named -18
/usr/local/apache/bin/httpd -15
/usr/lib/netscape/netscape +15
/home/byron/daemonprogram -5 32768
Under the rule I described (below), /sbin/init is practically invalid because
adding that entry to the /proc file would come AFTER /sbin/init was first
executed.
httpd would be killed with greater priority than named and syslogd (assuming
VSZ was the same), in case of a memory leak. Of course, you might not want
this, and you can easily change it.
On the other hand, if my daemonprogram starts taking up more than 32 meg, then
kill it first before killing the other daemons (only when system is running low
on memory).

I _had_ thought of that, but I don't know how clear that is in the process
structure. Malicious users can simply run setsid() to detach from a controlling
tty, thereby defeating the rule.

This would almost be in the same category as the 32-bit UIDs, where there are
TONS of people using a server or network cluster where memory shortage might
actually be a problem. I think it is a good route to explore.
